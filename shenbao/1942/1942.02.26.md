### Heated Debate in British Parliament on Indian Political Issues; Members Urge Government to Promptly Seek a Solution, Enabling the Indian Nation to Unleash Its Great Power

London, 24th (Reuters telegram) – During a debate in the House of Commons, Labor MP Martin urged the government to strengthen relations with the Soviet Union and India. Liberal MP Schuster, discussing the status of India, declared that merely promising India dominion status at a certain predetermined time would not solve the Indian problem. Liberal MP Harris also advocated a swift resolution to the Indian issue. It was stated that this was not the first time the British Empire had to deal with racial issues. In the past, we dealt with the problems of Canada and South Africa. Except for one unfortunate exception, we have generally achieved satisfactory solutions to such problems. We have done the same with the Irish problem, though success came too late. Our success in resolving the Canadian issue was due to Lord Durham's discoveries. Can we not find another Lord Durham, send him to India, and grant him full authority to peacefully resolve the urgent and paramount Indian problem? Independent MP Thurtle asked, "When will we make the people of India work together with us? What persuasive methods can we use to achieve our goal of having India fight on our side?" National Liberal MP Davies said, "I want India to fight for the ideals of its homeland and itself. I firmly believe that they are as devoted to their ideals as we are. All of China and the Soviet Union have their driving forces, but India, Burma, and Malaya lack them today, and this is lacking here as well. This situation must change."

London, 24th (Reuters telegram) – The future of India was also discussed in the House of Lords. Liberal MP Lord Samuel stated that India may face attack next year or the year after. Where can we turn for help to prevent it? The greatest help must come from within India. India's human resources are vast. India's 400 million people account for one-sixth of the world's population. Its armed forces number one million. If India were to follow the example of Canada, its army would be far more than a million, potentially reaching 15 to 20 million. The majority of India's population is not a warlike people, but there are many who are martial and have demonstrated their bravery in recent campaigns. If they have excellent leaders, they will certainly play a significant role on other battlefields.

London, 24th (Reuters telegram) – During today's debate in the House of Commons, the Indian problem became the main topic of discussion. National Liberal MP Schuster said that during the war, India must have a stable government, united to face the common danger. How should we expect India to respond to our hopes? How can we convince Indians that we are willing to devote ourselves to the political power they desire during the war? The path before us is not as simple as the British imagine. (Applause) If we say that at some point, we will grant India dominion status, it sounds very appealing, but in fact, it cannot provide a satisfactory solution to any problem. I say that if India can establish its necessary unity, no force in the world can hinder India's desired independence, and it is our responsibility to do everything possible to build India's strength and unity. India should know that its unity with us is for its own benefit. We can only grant India dominion status at a certain time, and we can improve or solve the Indian problem in Britain. Schuster then read a private letter from Jinnah, leader of the Muslim League of India, stating that Indian Muslims would never agree to a united central government of India and would be oppressed by the Hindu majority as a minority nation. Schuster continued, "We may disapprove of this attitude, but we must not ignore it. These issues are fundamental and cannot be resolved by simple principles, nor can they be put aside or reconciled during the war. What we should do is establish a strong national government during the war and make India realize that we are determined to do everything possible to establish India's freedom. I believe the British government has sincerely tried everything possible under the conditions of war. The British government cannot draft a new constitution until an agreement is reached, but it hopes to establish a truly representative administrative government of Indians under the existing constitutional framework. This was a major step forward last year, but some political leaders were unwilling to join the government as members of the Executive Council, believing that the Executive Council was subordinate to the Governor-General rather than a new cabinet of India. I propose that India establish a wartime cabinet composed of the Governor-General and ministers without portfolio to be responsible for directing the war, while the existing Executive Council remains responsible for the day-to-day operations of the various departments."

British Prime Minister Reports on the Far Eastern War Situation

London, 25th (Reuters telegram)

The House of Commons met yesterday to discuss military affairs. Prime Minister Churchill gave a long report, stating that Britain is fighting a life-and-death struggle with Germany and Italy, and it is inevitable to encounter major setbacks when suddenly having to deal with the third power, Japan. The expansion of the war in the Pacific has significantly affected the edge of British security, which is undeniable. We have done everything possible to save Singapore, transferring soldiers and aircraft from other places to reinforce it, even those that could not be transferred were forcibly transferred. These reinforcements totaled more than 40,000 men. However, Singapore is purely a naval base, not a fortress. It was initially fortified only to deal with attacks from the sea and did not take into account attacks from the land. Furthermore, when the air force was sent to reinforce the island, Japanese artillery had already controlled all the airfields on the island. The Japanese and Allied forces in the Pacific are vastly unequal in strength, and Japan has already gained control of the sea and air in that area. Therefore, we must expect all kinds of unfavorable experiences. The British War Cabinet has now been reorganized, and the Pacific Military Committee has also been established. This is a reasonably satisfactory military organization under the current circumstances.

London, 24th (Havas News Agency telegram) – A British government spokesman told the press that Japan now not only completely controls the sea, but also controls the sky. Therefore, we feel it is extremely difficult to reinforce the war zone. The extent of our naval losses in the past two months has been alarming, and we cannot match the troops that Japan can transfer in Southeast Asia. Our difficulties are indeed great, but we will not avoid them, lest others suffer fatal blows on our behalf. We will not act like cowards. If everyone can do their duty and swear not to abandon our allied forces, there is still hope of achieving victory after a long period of hardship and sacrifice. Japan's participation in the war has already reduced our chances of victory, which is undeniable, but we must still move forward bravely.

London, 24th (Reuters telegram) – British Colonial Secretary Cranborne today reviewed the situation on various battlefields in the House of Lords in his capacity as Speaker, some of which were more detailed than those presented by Prime Minister Churchill in the House of Commons. In response to the members' debate, Cranborne said, "It would be extremely foolish to ignore the setbacks suffered by the Allied countries in the Pacific. The fall of Singapore is a major setback. Reports on the final stages of the Battle of Singapore are still lacking. The entire garrison has been captured, so the commanders in charge cannot communicate with the British government. Some may ask, 'Was Singapore impossible to defend? Why did we confine such a large military force there? Could we have done more to defend Singapore?' From the point of view of the British government's advisors and the British generals in Singapore, Singapore should have been able to hold out for a longer time. But this view was formed before the Japanese attacked Singapore. If we could have defended Singapore, we would have done everything possible. If Singapore had not fallen, the entire Japanese strategic plan would have been delayed. Even a few weeks of holding out could have changed the situation. Therefore, from a strategic point of view, holding Singapore was inevitable. The Australian and New Zealand governments shared this view, but the results were all beyond expectations, and the reasons for the failure are therefore unknown to us. Japan attacked Singapore with elite troops, based on their long combat experience, taking advantage of the situation in the Far East with the greatest skill. The Japanese finally forced our troops to retreat, and after we lost the reservoirs, the island could not be held." Cranborne continued, regarding the situation in Burma, "We will do everything we can to respond to Japan's major threat to Burma. The security of Burma is vital to the interests of China and Britain. Today, Chinese and British troops are fighting together in southern Burma and are suffering constant and heavy pressure from the enemy. I fear that this pressure will continue unabated and will intensify. Some people now believe that India's million-strong army is doing nothing. This notion is entirely wrong. We should not think of this million-strong Indian army as a fully armed and well-trained army. Every soldier who has been armed has been mobilized, and equipment is also a problem. As for the British government's general policy towards India, the British government welcomes President Chiang Kai-shek's message to the people of India. We hope that the Chinese and Indian people have the closest understanding. President Chiang Kai-shek calls on India to rise up and fight for freedom, and we share the same sentiment. President Chiang Kai-shek hopes that India will gain political power, and so do we. If Indian leaders can unite and devise a plan that is satisfactory to all parties, the Indian problem can be resolved satisfactorily. It is hoped that President Chiang Kai-shek's visit can help Indian leaders take these steps."

### Discord Within British Conservative Party; Churchill Considers Resigning as Chairman

Washington, 25th (Havas News Agency telegram) – It is rumored that British Prime Minister Churchill intends to resign as chairman of the Conservative Party due to the demanding nature of his duties, which may lead to internal strife within the party. Political circles here are very concerned about this trend. Since the government representative in the British House of Commons has been replaced by the newly appointed Lord Privy Seal, Sir Stafford Cripps, many members of the Conservative majority party feel a sense of crisis due to Cripps' radical ideas and the heavy responsibility he bears. The party's hardliners (representatives of financial groups) and young progressives (representatives of social reform) had already been in disagreement.

### Rumor That the United States Plans to Lease Naval Bases from the Soviet Union; Japan Says It Is Not a Concern

Tokyo, 25th (Domei News Agency telegram) – Foreign sources have reported that the United States is currently planning to lease military bases on the Soviet Far East coast. A spokesman for the Japanese Cabinet Information Bureau told reporters today regarding this statement that the Soviet government is very wise and will not accept this request. Even if the Soviet Union leases such bases to the United States, it is irrelevant, as the United States military cannot reach the Soviet coast. As for President Roosevelt's broadcast speech, it was merely a repetition of his previous statements, and Allied listeners will surely be disappointed.

### The Scenery of Burma

The old capital of Burma is Ava, which is what everyone knows as Mandalay. The world-famous Great Buddha Temple and pagodas of various forms evoke the solemnity of a Buddhist kingdom. However, about forty-four miles from Ava, there is a place called "the Garden of Burma," which is Maymyo. The scenery here is beautiful, and the climate is pleasant, making it an ideal summer resort in Upper Burma. There are magnificent waterfalls that spray pearls and jade, forming deep pools of clear blue, inspiring distant thoughts (as shown in the picture above). The population of Burma is complex. On the streets of Rangoon, one can see people from every corner of the world. However, the Shan people of Burma constitute the absolute majority. Therefore, the areas where the Shan people are distributed in Burma are divided into the Northern Shan State and the Southern Shan State (as shown in the picture below). The three female nurses in Northern and Southern Shan State are Shan people, and their clothing and lifestyle are no different from the Han Chinese.

### Bombing Incident in Ankara, Turkey; Ambassador von Papen Escapes Unharmed; Turkish Dignitaries Express Sympathy to German Envoy

Ankara, Turkey, 24th (Havas News Agency) - German Ambassador to Turkey, Baron von Papen and his wife, were passing through Kemal Street at 10:00 this morning when a violent explosion suddenly occurred a few yards away. The Papens escaped unharmed and without injury. An official statement later stated, "On Tuesday morning, a bomb exploded on Kemal Street, killing one person at the scene. According to eyewitnesses, a person carrying a paper package was seen at the same time and place. This person is presumed to have been killed by the explosion, and the paper package was the bomb. Two young women were also injured. At the time of the incident, the German Ambassador and his wife were about 20 yards away and were knocked to the ground by the blast, but were not injured. They safely returned to the embassy. Subsequently, the Ministry of Interior and the police department immediately went to the scene to investigate. The President and Prime Minister both sent representatives to the German Embassy to express sympathy. The Foreign Minister and the Secretary-General of the Ministry also personally offered their condolences. It is assumed that the authorities are considering the possibility of a direct attack on the ambassador, as the bombing occurred near Ambassador von Papen."

Ankara, Turkey, 25th (Havas News Agency) - Regarding the attempted assassination of von Papen, it was previously reported that it was caused by a time bomb planted by terrorists. Investigation has revealed that this is incorrect. It was actually a common hand grenade thrown by the assailant. If it were the former, the hole blasted in the ground would have been deeper. The police department also announced that the person killed in the explosion was indeed the assassin and was carrying a handgun, but the nationality is unknown.

Switzerland, 25th (Havas News Agency) - Berlin dispatches to various newspapers stated that the bombing in Ankara, Turkey, in which German Ambassador von Papen narrowly escaped death, is believed by Berlin authorities to have been carried out by British intelligence agents. Newspapers claim that Ambassador von Papen's recent revelations of Soviet targets and the content of British Foreign Secretary Eden's talks with Soviet leaders were the primary cause of the bombing. Furthermore, Ambassador von Papen may have obtained other intelligence which he was providing to the Turkish government, and the UK and the USSR wanted to prevent its release. As of now, Berlin officials have not made any statement on the matter.

### Sweden Resolves to Arm, Maintain Peace, and Conduct Major Winter Maneuvers

Stockholm, Sweden (Havas News Agency) -  Norsing, the governor of the Stockholm region, spoke at a fundraising dance for the third national defense bond yesterday. He said, "We hope that Sweden will not be drawn into the vortex of the great powers' war. Any attempt, no matter where it comes from, to turn Swedish soil into a battlefield for great powers will be resisted by the Swedish government by force. This is the foundation of our nation, which has been repeatedly stated, and the national government's declaration of this policy has been deeply supported by national public opinion. It is especially necessary to tell the world that we sincerely hope for peace, but we are unwilling to accept peace at any cost. We believe that freedom and independence should be more important than peace. Trusting our country's destiny and trusting the future is our national policy."

Stockholm, Sweden, 25th (Haitong News Agency) - According to Swedish newspapers, the Swedish army is conducting large-scale winter exercises in the north, practicing various new tactics, such as ski teams penetrating enemy lines to attack their rear, and snowmobiles clearing the way for motorized units to advance. The exercise location is in the Jamtland region. The defending forces should first block the enemy's advance so that the main forces can complete their defenses. It is now known that the enemy forces suffered considerable losses after being attacked by light bomber squadrons and assault teams, but the enemy still has an advantage in the first phase.

### Anniversary of the Founding of the Nazi Party; Hitler's Message to Comrades

Munich, 25th (Haitong News Agency) - German Führer Hitler yesterday issued a message to veteran Nazi Party members gathered in Munich to celebrate the 22nd anniversary of the Nazi Party Program announced on February 24, 1920. The message was read by District Party Leader Faulhaber: "My dear comrades, this is the first time in many years that I cannot attend this celebration with my old comrades. During this winter period, I cannot leave my headquarters for even a moment, as the enemy is doing everything possible to recover what they have lost. From June to October last year, German troops advanced 1,000 kilometers into enemy territory to shatter the enemy's attempts to destroy our people and homes. This winter has been the harshest in a century. The speed of the German army's advance was unprecedented in military history and had to be temporarily halted. Our enemies are hoping that we will repeat Napoleon's mistakes during the winter, but this attempt has failed. Our brave and sacrificial soldiers and allied forces are fighting shoulder to shoulder, enduring the hardships of the weather, but their fighting spirit is as strong as ever. Now the coldest period is over, and the ice and snow in Crimea and southern Russia have begun to melt, so I cannot leave here, as we are preparing to deliver the final blow to the enemy who wants to destroy the Aryan nations and people. Jewish capitalist and communist societies are experiencing situations similar to those our country experienced in the years after the war, so today the Jews must bear full responsibility for the conflict between nations. The only difference between today's war and the war of 1914-1918 is that in 1919, our Nazi Party was only a small organization, but we clearly recognized and fought against international enemies who harmed mankind. Today, our national socialist ideology and the theory of the fascist revolution have controlled several powerful countries, so our mission will be realized. After this war, it will not be the Aryans who are destroyed, but the Jews. Although this war may last a long time, the result will be nothing but this. Only after the Jewish parasites are removed can this suffering world live in peace with each other and enjoy a long period of peace. Therefore, the comrades of our Nazi Party must make even greater sacrifices to achieve this goal, because what we are fighting for today originates from the Party Program announced on February 24, 1920. In these twenty-two years, Heaven has blessed us greatly, so we are confident that we will win. The Nazi Party Program of that day has now become the standard for building a new world. Today, in addition to congratulating all comrades, my thoughts are always with you."

### Japanese Authorities and Shanghai Municipal Council Handle Goods; Japanese Side Manages Trade and Manufacturing, Shanghai Municipal Council Implements Price Controls

Shanghai, by Tongmeng News Agency: It is learned that the Japanese military authorities are gradually dealing with the goods stored in warehouses in the Public Concession. A plan is now being drawn up to establish a system for the Japanese Asia Development Board and the Shanghai Municipal Council to jointly distribute goods. There is still some doubt about the scope of action of the Asia Development Board and the Shanghai Municipal Council. However, it is explained that the joint efforts of the two groups can smoothly implement economic management. From this point of view, it is highly desirable that the Asia Development Board be responsible for handling imported and stored goods and matters between manufacturing and wholesale, while the Shanghai Municipal Council handles matters between wholesalers and retailers. This management method is very reasonable, because the Asia Development Board has always been responsible for trade and manufacturing issues, and the Shanghai Municipal Council has previous experience in controlling prices, and can effectively implement any control measures.

The agreement stipulates the methods for the UK to repay the US for aid provided under the Lend-Lease Act after the war. The main points are to eliminate tariff discrimination in pre-war international trade and to generally reduce tariff rates in order to achieve the economic objectives stipulated in the Atlantic Charter. President Roosevelt told reporters that the purpose of the agreement is to develop the production, use, exchange, and consumption of goods, thereby establishing a free and happy material foundation for the people of all countries. It also stipulates that "once the war is over, production and trade must be increased to meet the needs of the UK and other participating countries."

### Curfew Implemented at the Wusong Estuary; Night Navigation Prohibited; Some Vessels to Change Schedules

According to the Shanghai Times, it is heard from port officials that the curfew in the city has been extended to the Huangpu River from yesterday (the 24th), prohibiting all vessels from entering or leaving the Wusong area of the Huangpu River after dusk. The authorities have also notified shipping companies to change their vessel schedules to adapt to the curfew restrictions with minimal inconvenience. Yesterday, vessel activity on the Huangpu River decreased due to the curfew. Only one ship from Qingdao carrying a small amount of coal, and a ship from the Yangtze River estuary carrying hundreds of bags of rice, successively docked. As for the many ships carrying thousands upon thousands of Chinese people returning to their hometowns, they were not seen arriving yesterday, perhaps because they were blocked outside the port. Port officials said yesterday that the curfew is intended to prevent undesirable elements from entering. A curfew was also implemented on the Huangpu River four years ago when the Shanghai war broke out, but it was soon relaxed, and the Huangpu River resumed normal traffic. It is heard that after the implementation of the curfew on the Huangpu River this time, only a few vessels will need to change their schedules, as most shipping vessels have long been scheduled to depart after dawn. However, incoming vessels must enter the port during daylight hours.

### Brothers Quarrel and Develop a Grudge; Shooting Attempt on Younger Brother Fails; Long-Standing Discord Leads to Murderous Intent Over a Minor Rent Issue

Guo Shangqi, a local resident (53 years old), residing at 262 Qipu Road in a self-built house, made his fortune in the construction industry. He is known for his violent temper and indulgences. Relying on a substantial inheritance, he lives a carefree life without worrying about hunger or cold. He possesses a self-defense pistol with a license from the Public Works Department. He has a younger brother named Yuzhi, born to a

Stepmother.

In the past, the brothers' relationship was strained, and they frequently quarreled over minor matters. The younger brother, fearing his elder brother's rash temperament, did not argue. Recently, he rented a downstairs bedroom to a friend, which the elder brother, Shangqi, disapproved of, leading to another dispute. Around 11 PM on the 24th, the younger brother, Yuzhi, was in bed with his three-year-old daughter, preparing to sleep, while his wife, Qin, sat on the edge of the bed. Unexpectedly, the elder brother, Shangqi, entered with his self-defense pistol and fired a shot at the younger brother,

The initial opening price of 20s double horse factory single was 2,110 yuan. Afterwards, the table became tight due to enthusiastic buyers and short covering, so it gradually rose to 2,200 yuan. However, some profits were sold, and it was seen to loosen back to 2,115 yuan. The final closing price was 2,175 yuan. The price of 42s blue phoenix was 4,930 yuan to 4,920 yuan, 60s color ball 9,850 yuan, 80s sunlight 11,500 yuan, 40s Jincheng 4,270 yuan to 290 yuan, 23s Golden Rooster 2,350 yuan to 2,380 yuan, 32s Golden Pagoda 3,750 yuan, 32s Golden Tiger 3,720 yuan, 20s Tiannv 2,550 yuan, 20s Red Kui Star 2,400 yuan, 20s Blue Phoenix 2,860 yuan, 23s Bao Yi 2,380 yuan, 14s Golden Pagoda 2,110 yuan, 20s Xie Ma spot 2,420 yuan to 2,460 yuan, 16s Fu Yan 2,280 yuan, 16s Aircraft 2,300 yuan, 10s Nine Fish 1,700 yuan.

### Stacked Goods Are Supplied Continuously; Cotton Cloth Sales Are Stable

Factory Cloth: Yesterday's market situation was peaceful. The inventory of goods in various warehouses was continuously supplied to the market, and the stock was sufficient. Transactions were becoming more and more prosperous. The sales of plaid cloth and twill were flat, while fine cloth and fine twill saw both ups and downs. Bleached, finished goods, and gray fabric forward contracts had a large volume of transactions, and the opening price increased slightly. Flower butterfly coarse cloth was 125 yuan, 14-pound One Deer was 102 yuan and a half, 11-pound Three Rabbit was 85 yuan and a half, 8-pound Zhenzhong was 62 yuan, Dapeng fine cloth was 97 yuan and a half, Fugui fine cloth was 95 yuan and a half, 190 Meiting Shilinfu was 175 yuan, Jin Sata bleached cloth was 120 yuan, and Lunchang Cro cloth was 85 yuan. The turnover of spot and forward contracts in this street was more than 500 pieces, and the Ningbo gang handled 50 to 60 pieces of bleached cloth and printed cloth.

Dong Cloth: The market was firm. The first-line fine cloth factory opened at 110 yuan, and slightly dropped to 109 yuan and a half in the middle. The noon closing still rose to 110 yuan. Mid-range fine cloth was active according to actual needs, and all have risen sharply. Caiqiu Yanghe new single opened at 103 yuan 5 jiao, Trumpet 102 yuan, Wufu Shuangyu 101 yuan and 5 jiao, all of which rose by 1 yuan compared to the previous day. Baby fine twill was 93 yuan and a half, Wufu Shuangyu was 96 yuan, and Four Gentlemen Serge was 3 yuan 5 jiao 6 fen for the October to December singles, and only 3 yuan 3 jiao 67 fen for the July to September.

### Woolen Fabrics Remain Scarce Throughout

The woolen fabric market is quite tense, and the market is high. Sellers are hoarding, and there are no wholesale transactions except for some social transactions. Persi has transactions because there are still general hoarders, and the reopening of Fuchang Warehouse means that car goods are no longer restricted. People's hearts in the woolen fabric industry have become more active.

### Soybean Peaks Are Emerging One After Another; All Beans Are Rising

Soybean cargo owners are hoarding more and more. Yesterday, under the competition between Yiyuan Gang and Tofu Workers, the price soared by four or five yuan. Tianjin Jintian创 set a high of 170 days, selling 700 packages, priced at 164 yuan to 170 yuan. A carload of Wuhu soybeans was priced at 149 yuan, and 60 packages of Pudong Du soybeans were priced at 149 yuan.

Red mung beans and Hebei beans are becoming increasingly expensive due to the scarcity of arrivals and the active hoarding, and the price has risen by two or three yuan compared to before. It is estimated that more than 200 packages of Chongming sand red were sold, priced at 130 yuan to 132 yuan and a half, and more than 100 packages of sand silkworms were priced at 84 yuan to 84 yuan and a half. 300 packages of Tianjin tea beans were priced at 156 yuan.

Red sorghum transactions were weaker yesterday, and the market was stable. It is estimated that one carload of Mingguang red sorghum was sold, priced at 73 yuan.

Raw peanuts did not have many transactions yesterday, and the market was still firm. It is estimated that 100 packages of Hefei raw peanuts were sold, priced at 235 yuan.

Soybean cake speculative transactions were quite good. Initially, the market was slightly weak due to retail sales, but it rebounded due to hoarding among non-industry hoarders, resulting in a slight increase of three to five jiao compared to before. It is estimated that more than 3,000 pieces of Shenji soybean cake were sold, with May warehouse orders priced at 33 yuan to 34 yuan, January warehouse orders at 39 yuan 2 jiao, and February warehouse orders at 39 yuan and a half. 1,500 pieces of Hankou soybean cake were priced at 25 yuan to 26 yuan 3 jiao.

The bran market was increasingly strong yesterday, and there were still some inquiries in the mainland countryside, so the market price was gradually raised by the hoarders. Sanxin bran opened at 67 yuan, and then from 67 yuan and a half to 68 yuan, rising another two yuan compared to the previous market. Transactions still reached two or three thousand packages, it is said.

### Domestic Rice Turns To Be Stable

Yesterday, domestic rice continued to be outstanding. Glutinous rice was depleted and scarce, which made it even more tense. More than ten packages of newly arrived Southern Gang Yin Yuan were sold out, and the price was more than ten yuan higher than the previously opened Northern Gang Jintan Yuan, which was a huge increase of sixty or seventy yuan compared to the last opening price of Yin Yuan last winter. This is because the opening price last winter was still within 200 yuan, while yesterday's market soared to 265 yuan. Early rice and late rice in the Southern Gang once rose by five or six yuan in the early market, but then retreated by two or three yuan due to the scarcity of arrivals and sales, but it was still two or three yuan higher than the previous market. It is estimated that late rice opened at 2635 yuan, and early rice opened from 268 yuan to 2614 yuan. The supply and demand of Northern japonica rice were balanced, and the market was stable. Kun japonica rice was 280 yuan to 2756 yuan.

### Cigarettes and Candles Are Slightly Weak

Since the red market, cigarettes have been smooth sailing, but yesterday's market has been weak due to the high price. It is estimated that each box of British brand opened at 7,900 yuan, Old Knife brand 6,900 yuan, Wuhua brand 4,500 yuan, Little Fairy brand 4,500 yuan, and Pinhai brand 6,400 yuan, all of which fell by more than 400 yuan compared to the previous day. Japanese cigarettes Quanlu brand was 2,370 yuan, Jin Dalou 1,970 yuan, and Jinqiang brand 1,690 yuan. The market was flat and weak.

Daily necessities such as matches and candles were still in strong demand. It is estimated that the factory could hardly start work due to the exhaustion of raw materials, and the market goods were decreasing day by day, so the price tended to soar. The estimated price was 2,400 yuan per box for Beautiful brand matches, 2,250 yuan for Phoenix brand, 133 yuan for Bai Xiangmao soap, 117 yuan for Huang Xiangmao soap, 140 yuan for Gu Mu soap, 120 yuan for Arrow Knife soap, and 86 yuan for Sailboat brand candles, all of which were slightly weaker than the buying price on the previous day.

### Miscellaneous Road Red Dates Rise

Recently, miscellaneous road red dates have risen step by step due to the scarcity of sources and the active sales. Yesterday, long red dates opened at 115 yuan. It is found that the lowest price last year was less than 60 yuan, and the increase before and after has exceeded one time. At the same time, Fu Hong jujubes also rose by forty or fifty yuan, and the market price was called 140 yuan.

### Citrus Fruits (8)

— Gao Jiannong

I don't want to elaborate too much on the various ways to eat citrus fruits, as that would take up too much space. As for their benefits to people, ancient Chinese medicine has already stated that they can moisten the lungs, resolve phlegm, quench thirst, invigorate the stomach, and so on. You can understand this clearly by simply opening a copy of the Materia Medica. Now, according to scholarly research, it is known that they are rich in "Vitamin C," which can prevent scurvy and treat neuritis, etc., providing a powerful scientific proof for the old medical methods of our country.

How many citrus fruits can our country produce each year? This statistic is probably difficult to determine accurately. According to a survey by the Ouhai Customs in previous years: the citrus fruits from Wenzhou alone, transported to Shanghai each year, already amount to no less than four million catties! If we combine the whole country, the number is certainly not small. However, our country's population is so large that even this small amount cannot provide an adequate supply. As for the production in Europe: Italy and Sicily together produce 170,000 metric tons annually; Spain and Portugal produce 80,000 metric tons; France and Egypt, etc., each produce 4,000 metric tons. What about the production volume in Japan and the United States? The statistics are currently unknown. (The End)

Current Affairs

### Mistaking a Different Path

— Jin Yi

After the refusal of various nightclubs' requests to extend business hours, vegetable stalls in the French Concession also applied to extend their business hours. One in the morning, one in the evening; one for consumption, one for livelihood, which is quite interesting.

The rejection of nightclubs' request to extend business hours was expected, as all entertainment venues close at 11:00 PM. Why treat some differently and ask the "foreign music devils" to exert more effort? Moreover, it is inconvenient to travel at night and people are very wary. The dance girls and "young gentlemen" come for "a liter of rice," which cannot be helped. Would the rich masters and young gentlemen be willing to risk contracting typhoid fever? To put it more forcefully and justly, dance halls are places of consumption that promote licentiousness and pleasure, and there is really no need to extend business hours!

Vegetable stalls are indeed seeking profit, but their service-oriented business is the same as the duties of "butlers" and others. Didn't a "butler" strike happen before, making all of Shanghai stink? The vegetable stall owners get up before dawn and come from the distant suburbs to the concessions. We who live in the "small circles" not only "don't know the taste of meat for three months" but also don't know the "fragrance of vegetable soup." Their "application" is very legitimate and should be facilitated.

However, to be honest, the result after extending business hours may not be optimistic. Because their reason for applying is that "the spring cold is severe, and citizens have not shaken off the habit of getting up late." The so-called "getting up late" only applies to a portion of people. Moreover, those who can rest easy in bed will certainly have their household cooks go to the market on time and return fully loaded. Those who "delay" getting up are waiting for their cooks to cook and prepare meals. The remaining people who cannot enjoy "staying under the covers" will not forget the "closing at 11:00 PM" rule. Perhaps they buy too few vegetables – the proportion of their purchases in the total volume of vegetable stalls is too small, so they think that "if they ask for vegetables a little late, they will all be gone." Or perhaps they are taking the wrong path, rushing to line up in front of rice shops and cannot spare time to buy a catty of spinach.

The most fashionable slogan these days is "close early." Requesting to extend business hours, even if it "doesn't affect the electricity," depends on "how" the customers are. (Note: The scope of "how" includes economy, time, and other factors.)

### Better to Have No Car

— Qin Ren

After the disappearance of cars, bicycles have become quite popular. In front of various theaters, wooden racks for parking bicycles have been set up. As a result, the "value" of bicycles has almost exceeded that of a "precious Austin" from before. In addition to rushing for the tram every day, I always think of adopting the "saving New Year's money method" so that after a few months, I can fly onto a bike, whistling "I love to whistle" and feel proud. However, in today's world, things change in an instant. Whether it will still be the age of bicycles in Shanghai after a few months, no one can guarantee. In case I have no "luck with cars," and after exchanging my hard-earned money for a bicycle, I have to clear a corner of my bedroom to use as a "garage," where would I even begin!

During my school days, I also put in effort on bicycles. For example, when encountering a red light, I could turn the front wheel sideways and hold the posture of riding a horse for a long time without moving, unlike those female students who had to "get off here" and push the bike across the road after the green light before getting back on – that's troublesome enough. Yesterday, I saw a group of female students stopped by a red light on the road, all getting off their bikes. Actually, there were no vehicles passing on the east-west roads at that time. Perhaps the traffic controllers were testing the excellence of their driving skills?

Speaking of which, pedestrians always envy those who have cars. If "car" specifically refers to automobiles, then there is still reason, because as long as the car body is sturdy, even if it collides with a tram, at most it will cost a few dollars to repair the fenders. Even if a fatal accident unfortunately occurs, the chauffeur is fully responsible, and the person in the car will not face imprisonment. Other vehicles are not the same: passengers being thrown from rickshaws is common, and when danger comes, they often share life and death with the rickshaw puller. These "wronged souls on vehicles," it is said, cannot be reborn as humans after death. Now everyone is fond of bicycles, and managing one's own actions may be safer than letting a rickshaw puller decide. If one encounters a red light on the road, one can get off the bike first and wait, then push the bike across the road. The "master" gets on the bike, and there should be no danger. However, the purpose of riding in a "vehicle" is to be fast and comfortable. Bicycles need to be pedaled with feet, which is already "self-reliance." Furthermore, having to get on and off the bike countless times limits the speed.

I once did a statistical analysis of the time it takes to get from home to the office: taking a rickshaw takes 11 minutes and costs 60 to 80 cents. Walking takes about 20-odd minutes. Taking a tram takes at least half an hour or more, sometimes even exceeding 45 minutes, and due to changing trams, the fare is 44 cents. The reason I want to buy a bicycle is for the above reasons, but first, I need a sum of money - the "saving New Year's money method" is not reliable; second, I need to re-examine my driving skills, otherwise, the gains will not be worth the losses, better to have no car!

### "Squeezing" Oil

— Xin Meng

In this day and age, one truly sees something new every day. "Squeezing" rice has become a common term, and now the new phenomenon of "squeezing" oil has emerged. It is said that Shanghai's edible oil reserves are also feeling depleted, so buying oil also requires "squeezing."

Initially, soy sauce shops and grocery stores had edible oil available one moment and not the next. Later, everyone simply sealed their oil tanks, and edible oil disappeared. This tells people that the shortage of edible oil in Shanghai will also form a serious problem.

Due to the lack of oil reserves, in addition to some stores stopping selling edible oil, a few oil shops and grocery stores still sell edible oil, but there are restrictions on both time and quantity. Generally, the selling time is from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM every day, and it is not sold after the time limit. The quantity limit is one yuan or one catty for some.

With restrictions, people who buy oil want to buy more, so they must go on time. Thus, like buying rice, buying oil also requires "squeezing." In front of larger oil shops, a…

### Save the Parents

— Rong

"Dad, the teacher said that tutoring for one hour every afternoon costs twenty-five yuan."

"I'll teach you at home. You tell the teacher you won't be tutored."

"The teacher won't let us leave. If we leave, we'll be punished."

"..." I couldn't help but gasp. (Gratitude)

### Sharing the Boat in Wind and Rain

— He Jia Zhi

(I) Evening of Wind and Rain

Guoqi stepped from the front cabin to the middle cabin and sat next to the woman, letting the light shine on both of their faces from the front. Weicheng said, "So, this is your younger sister. Just now...?" The woman said, "Isn't it? I just saw her on the tram, and now it's the second time. Mr. Ye." Weicheng had an inexplicable joy, scratching his temples, rubbing his palms, and clapping his hands like Guoqi, saying, "I'm really confused. I saw your younger sister on the tram just now and thought this lady looked very familiar. I must have seen her somewhere. Actually, you siblings are too similar. I saw Brother Guoqi. This time, meeting on the boat, I thought this lady looked just like the lady I saw on the tram. Clearly, I hadn't seen her before, mistaking her for someone I had seen. Clearly, it's the same person, mistaking her for two people. Brother Guoqi, where does this come from?" Guoqi raised his hand and said, "You're being polite with me again, calling me Brother Guoqi. I oppose feudalism, but at the same time, I oppose hypocrisy. I call you Weicheng, and you call me Guoqi, which is great. There's no need to ask who is older by a few years. Like my younger sister, her name is Yuanfang. You can call her Guo Fang. My younger sister is your younger sister. There's nothing wrong with calling her younger sister." Everyone laughed at what Guoqi said.

The boat was swaying violently, and we knew it was starting to sail. Occasionally, after laughing, hearing the mournful organ and the sound of rain hitting the roof, we no longer felt any desolation. Guofang wanted Weicheng to sit in the middle cabin and said that his coat was wet and he shouldn't keep wearing it. Guoqi made a larger bed out of the boat planks and spread the bedding out like the Jiang family's big quilt. Everyone took off their shoes, sat under the covers, and talked about various things from the past.

Weicheng and Guoqi were classmates for a year in the county high elementary school and another year in the county junior high school. In the second year of junior high school, Guoqi transferred to a church school in Shanghai to study, while Weicheng stayed in the county junior high school until graduation. Because another classmate was going to take the exam for Suzhou Agricultural College, they went together. (6)

### Luozhou Shadow Puppets

— Ze Fu

In the Jidong area of Hebei, there is a type of theater called Luozhou shadow puppets, also known as shadow plays or donkey-hide shadows. Local people believe that this play originated in Luozhou in the early Qing Dynasty, but this is not true. According to historical records, in Bianjing (now Kaifeng) of the Northern Song Dynasty, there were already people performing shadow plays. The carved shadow figures were initially made of plain paper, and later of sheepskin. Loyal and righteous figures were carved with righteous appearances, while treacherous and evil figures were carved with ugly shapes. The stories performed were mostly the same as those told by storytellers. In the Southern Song Dynasty, Hangzhou also had them. See the books "Menglianglu" and "Ducheng Jisheng." Thus, the origin is ancient, and it certainly did not begin in the early Qing Dynasty. However, the shadow figures used in Luozhou today are mostly carved from donkey skin, about a foot long, and sometimes made of cowhide or sheepskin. The play is quite like a sound film, using a large screen (in the past, thick plain paper was also used, but it was easily damaged) about six feet long and three and a half feet wide. A kerosene lamp is placed behind the screen (recently, some have used electric lights). The performers are usually two people, one on the left and one on the right, standing behind the screen and holding the shadow figures to perform. The scripts are mostly taken from popular novels, called shadow scrolls. The performance is called Xuan Juan, meaning to preach and explain the book scrolls. Famous ones include "The Powdered Building," "Five Tigers Pacifying the West," and "Twice Blooming Plum," etc. The plots are quite long, and it takes at least three to five days to complete the performance. During the performance, there is both speaking and singing. The singing method is similar to Henan Zhui Zi, and the musical instruments do not use the Erhu, only the stringed instruments, as well as gongs and drums. Usually, open-air performances must be performed at night. If changed to indoors, there is no need for this restriction, which is exactly the same as movies.

### Thoughts Under the "Lamp"

— Qi Ming

Every time I return to my hometown, I harbor hopes for the deep courtyards of my old friends' homes, hoping that they will be renovated soon and give me a new pleasant feeling. However, over the years, the old house has not changed its original appearance. Moreover, because it is near the coast, storms and rainstorms have ravaged it, and the result of the destruction is that it has become even more "withered."

Since the countryside had a kerosene lamp factory, a night market also emerged in the short street. Over time, the uneven stone roads began to be illuminated by streetlights. Several large families, some for practical reasons and some for vanity, became interested in electric lights and connected them from the power poles into their halls. My family was also unable to avoid this trend and enjoyed the representative of 20th-century material civilization - electric lights.

My grandfather no longer interfered with my reading under the lamp, because he had also discovered the difference in brightness between kerosene lamps and electric lights. In this way, I read many books under the five-candlepower electric light. However, when I returned to my hometown last year, the only new point of civilization, the electric light, also lost its light due to the lack of diesel. At night, using kerosene lamps to light the way, the ancient mansion was even more ancient!

My family members wrote to ask me to send some foreign candles, only then did I realize that even kerosene lamps were no longer available in the countryside. My family was getting along with dim vegetable oil lamps, or had returned to primitive times, imitating the ancients who worked at sunrise and rested at sunset. It is not difficult to imagine what the ancient mansion has become. From vegetable oil lamps to electric lights, civilization gave my childhood a lot of joy, but from electric lights returning to vegetable oil lamps, the blow that reality has given to my family must also be very painful. Perhaps my family members are staring blankly at the ineffective electric light shell under the vegetable oil lamp every night, with endless attachment.

Writing this under the lamp amidst the calls for electricity conservation, what are my feelings like!

When it's time to sell oil, a long snake-like line will definitely form, as if drawing from the experience of buying rice. Without the police, people will line up themselves.

"Squeezing" oil is indeed not as crowded as "squeezing" rice, but when the oil shop pulls down the iron gate, it will also leave behind some people who cannot buy oil, taking their foreign bottles and returning in frustration. Having money but not being able to buy things is a rare joke. I wonder, behind "squeezing" oil, what new terms of "squeezing" × "squeezing" × will be produced?

### Stage and Screen

— Tai Xu

Due to the storage of film negatives, the filming of each company will be restricted in the future. It is said that the total amount will not exceed six films per month, which will be distributed according to the size of the company.

Liu Qiong's "Wedding Night" has not yet been seen by the audience, but the role of Emperor Tang Minghuang is quite "popular" at the Carlton. However, since the first day of the new year, with two shows a day, this "hedonistic emperor" may be physically exhausted, so there is an intention to ask Huang He to take over.

When Yingzi first went to the film set to shoot "Turmoil Scenery," someone asked her how it compared to acting in plays. Her answer was wonderful: "The sound of the clapperboard is too loud."

The Russian song and dance troupe will only perform at the Grand Theater for one day on March 6th. If the box office performance is not bad, there may be a continuation. This is the consistent style of Asia Cinema.

Mei Xi, Bai Yun, Shangguan Yunzhu, and others returned to Shanghai a few days ago. It is said that the trip was quite satisfactory. The plays performed were only a few small plays such as "The Dumb Wife" and "The Proposal."

Gu Lanjun, after "The Fallen Woman" and "Aristocratic Woman's Romance," claims that she will change her style.
