### Both Germany and the Soviet Union Claim the Front Lines Are Generally Quiet; Germany Still Plans to Advance on Moscow; Final Batch of Italian Blackshirts Headed to the Eastern Front

Stockholm, Sweden, 3rd Day, Havas: Today, both Germany and the Soviet Union issued war reports stating that the Eastern Front is generally quiet. The wording of their reports is similar, marking the first time in the past three weeks. In the past, their statements invariably contradicted each other. Of course, there are still some sporadic battles on various fronts, all of which are skirmishes and none of which affect the overall situation. Last night, Moscow broadcast mentioned that Soviet forces had launched an offensive on Lake Ilmen, but did not specify the details. It is likely that the scope is not large. In the Kharkov area, there is only patrolling. The German army is currently carrying out mopping-up operations. However, the Soviet communique stated that Soviet forces had recaptured the area of Verkhnii Byk, south of Kharkov. In addition, the Soviet Air Force is extremely active in southern Finland, especially over Kotka, as the area is a crucial hub for German reinforcements to the Finnish front and is of great importance. However, the Soviet side seems to have only sent a small number of aircraft to participate in the air raids, and the damage to the Finnish military is minimal. According to observations by military experts, the current lull on the Eastern Front is unlikely to last. A major battle will resume within days, which, although not necessarily decisive, will certainly indicate the trend of victory.

Somewhere on the Soviet Border, 3rd Day, Havas: The battle of Kharkov has in fact ended. It is expected that the central sector will be the focus of attention for all parties. According to the latest news, the German army seems to be preparing to begin its advance on Moscow. At that time, German forces in all areas of the central sector will participate in the fighting. The initial German action is to attack the city of Rzhev. However, fierce fighting is currently taking place in the Kalinin area in the north. According to Soviet claims, the Red Army has seized strategically advantageous positions from the German army. In addition, the German side has also concentrated a large army in the Bryansk area, preparing to launch a major offensive. At the same time, the air forces of both sides are extremely active.

Berlin, 4th Day, Reuter: Military sources here claimed last night that the German army's victory in Kharkov and Donets had now restored the situation to what it was before Timoshenko launched his offensive.

### North African Intense Heat and Sandstorm: The War Continues to Develop, the Battle on the Gazala Line Nears its Climax, Germany and Britain Seek to Maintain Supply Lines

Lisbon, 4th (Associated Press): The Libyan sandstorms are hindering military operations on both sides, but the battles on the east and west sides of the Gazala Line are now rapidly approaching their most intense point. It is reported that the British new sharp tanks have begun desperate attacks to drive out the African divisions of German General Rommel's forces. According to sources in Cairo, the battle is taking place in scorching heat above 100 degrees, and it is generally believed that the outcome will determine whether the German army can hold the area east of Sayna and Merichi. British air operations are hampered by sandstorms, and the attacks of armored forces are also greatly slowed down. Visibility on the battlefield is only twenty yards at noon, and nothing can be seen face-to-face at dusk. However, the war is still proceeding on a large scale. London says that General Rommel is now determined to seize Bir Hakeim and has gained a foothold in the center of the British positions, while maintaining the accessibility of the supply line to the west. The British army is targeting this supply line for attack.

German Supreme Headquarters, 4th (Havas): This afternoon's German military report stated that many more enemy soldiers were captured in North Africa, and twenty-two tanks and seven artillery pieces were destroyed. German and Italian air forces bombed railway facilities and military camps in Gafsa.

Rome, 4th (Havas): Today's communique from the Italian military headquarters stated that the battle of Marmarica yesterday was favorable to our army. The enemy destroyed twenty-four tanks and seven artillery pieces and captured many prisoners. Axis air forces bombed railway facilities and depots in Gafsa. Motorcade was bombed heavily. The enemy's nest was fiercely bombed by German aircraft. Five British Curtis aircraft were shot down. Two of our planes did not return to their original defenses. A British air force team was intercepted by German fighter planes over Pantelleria, losing five Spitfire British planes. Enemy planes attacked Augusta, and anti-aircraft guns shot down one enemy plane.

Stockholm, Sweden, 4th (Havas): According to sources in London, the North African battlefield is currently encountering intense heat and sandstorms, but the war is still developing. According to an editorial in The Times, the Axis forces have not yet been defeated, and the enemy's tank divisions appear to have ample ammunition and reserves. Although the main force of the enemy is in retreat, it is unknown whether the British Eighth Army can take advantage of this strategic advantage to pursue the enemy. The Eighth Army may suffer heavy losses in this hot battle. It is reported that the Axis forces have been able to expand their corridor in the British minefield and establish a position in the east. According to the British, the position has been besieged by the British army.

Somewhere on the Libyan Front, 3rd (Havas): The new offensive launched by German General Rommel, commander-in-chief of the German army in North Africa, against the British army yesterday may be the beginning of the second phase of the Axis army's offensive in North Africa. Fierce battles have broken out near Knightsbridge and El Adem. However, when the Axis forces launched a new offensive, the British army also launched a frontal attack on the main German-Italian line. The results of the two sides' offensives are still unknown. However, one thing is certain: the two gaps that the German army broke through in the British positions have merged into one, with a very large area. The German army at the eastern end of the gap has also greatly increased. Some military experts believe that General Rommel's new offensive is a kind of protection for the infantry, so that its main force can advance westward and maintain the gap in the British position until the Axis forces fighting south of Knightsbridge arrive. In short, the future war situation will depend on whether the Axis countries can concentrate their forces to attack Tobruk, or whether the British army can advance westward. It is also heard that the US's four tanks have been very active in North Africa.

Berlin, 4th (Havas): According to well-informed military sources here last night, "It is too early to draw conclusions about the final outcome of the North African war." British reports also show the same opinion, and the results of the war are also very vague. However, German and Italian military reports reported the capture of 2,000 and 3,000 British soldiers respectively, which shows that the enemy has been greatly hit.

Berlin, 4th (Havas): The German Supreme Headquarters announced last night that German dive bombers bombed a British vehicle concentration point south of Tobruk and motorized troops on the coastal highway on Tuesday night. The air raid lasted for an hour, and countless enemy vehicles were destroyed.

Stockholm, Sweden, 4th (Havas): According to this question to London, the North African war situation remains unchanged. British officials have confirmed that General Rommel has merged the two gaps broken through in the British minefield into one large gap of sixteen kilometers to prevent British artillery from the side.

### Three, A Brief History of Syria (1)

(1) Introduction: American columnist Walter Lippmann wrote the following words in the New York Times on June 10 last year: "Since this war, Britain has hardly taken a single initiative in military affairs, following everything and lagging behind everywhere. The only thing that can be considered an initiative is the joint attack on Syria by the Free French forces (referring to June 8 last year)."

Before June 8, 1941, Syria was a French mandate. At that time, Crete had been occupied by the German army, and the French air bases in Syria had also been used by Germany. If Hitler could use this situation to quickly occupy Syria, then in the north he could threaten Turkey, in the east he could spy on Iran and Iraq, and in the south he could go straight to Palestine and attack Suez. The situation in the Near East would have been different from today. However, although the crisis in the Near East has not yet been eliminated for a year, and Britain's control here has not changed, half of the reason for this is due to the German-Soviet war, but the British "preemptive move" on June 8 last year also played a part.

(2) Recollections of the Past

What kind of place is Syria? The historical events in the Taoist temple cannot be described exhaustively. We will excerpt a paragraph from the Encyclopedia Britannica as a simple explanation.

Based on the study of Stone Age and other prehistoric relics, we can know that Syria has been inhabited for a very long time. The ethnic groups that have lived in the territory since historical times have mostly been Semitic, fighting each other. The politics of that time cannot be known in detail now, but it is known that the territory belonged to a situation of small city-states standing side by side, and the government affairs were in the hands of the nobles. After the middle of the 16th century BC, there was a division between the north and the south, each with a system, which historians call the Canaanites (Oananite). In the first millennium BC, the Arameans occupied northern and southern Syria, and were the Aramean dynasty. During the Canaanite era, Syria was a place for cultural exchange between Egypt and Babylon, resulting in a distinctive West Asian culture. But in the Aramean era, its culture was greatly influenced by Greece and Rome, and crafts such as embroidery, glass, and ceramics were highly developed. A characteristic of Syrian culture is its lack of originality, but its influence is very broad, and its influence on the Arabs is particularly profound and far-reaching. The Arabic calligraphy is derived from Syrian calligraphy.

After the 8th century BC, Syria became a place invaded by various ethnic groups. Before this, there was a struggle between Babylon and Egypt. In 332 BC, the Macedonians invaded. When Alexander the Great invaded the east, the entire territory was invaded by the Greeks. The cities built by the Greeks here are important in the history of Syria. In 64 BC, Pompey occupied the area, only the Nabataeans of the Arab tribe resisted stubbornly in the north, and it lasted for a long time. But later, Syria finally became a province of the Roman Empire. In 616 AD, Syria was invaded by the Persians, and from 622 to 628, it returned to the Eastern Roman Empire. After 636, it was transferred to the hands of Muslims. Although the Islamic dynasties were eventful every year, Syria was still able to maintain its prosperity at this time. Only when the Mongols conquered the west, the territory was destroyed. Since then, the prosperity of the past has said goodbye to Syria. In the early 15th century, the Ottomans seized Syria. Since then, Syria has become a part of the Turkish Empire until the last world war.

In the Middle Ages, Syria was an important route for trade between Europe and the East. With the opening of the Red Sea route, its importance increased. Only when the Suez Canal opened, its position was taken by the latter.

(3) The Arab Struggle

The above is just a brief history of Syria since historical times and before the last world war. What should be added here is that after Syria became a part of the Turkish Empire, most of the people living in the territory were Arabs. Although they were under Turkish rule, they struggled to establish an Arab state at all times. When the last world war broke out, the flames of this struggle spread throughout the Near East. Professor Gibb, an expert on Arab affairs at Oxford University in Britain, wrote an article entitled "The Group of Arab Countries", which describes this in detail. Let us quote one of the paragraphs below:

The Near East is the base of the Arab struggle, and Syria is its center. They are intoxicated with the Arab tradition and the glory of the Arab Empire, dreaming that one day they will be able to achieve revival. During the long sleep of the Turkish Empire, this spirit seemed to have diminished. Fortunately, the existence of the Arab language and literary heritage has maintained the boundary between the Arabs and the Turks. Many outstanding Arabs served in the Turkish army and government. Like the Turks, they also produced a trend of national thought. When the European War broke out in 1941-1948, they believed that the opportunity had arrived. As a result of the intervention of the British and French governments to the authorities in Mecca, the leader of Arab nationalism participated in the work of overthrowing Turkish rule, and formed the glorious voice of creating a unified Arab state.

After the Arabs in Syria and other places rose up to resist Turkey, the British and French authorities issued a declaration in November 1918, which contained the following guarantee:

In the Near East, all ethnic groups that were oppressed by Turkey in the past will be completely liberated in the future. After that, the governments formed by the ethnic groups in the Near East will be completely elected by the local people. Such governments must respect the will of the people, and their credibility will also increase day by day.

This guarantee will of course make the Arabs rise up in response, so incidents of attacking soldiers and destroying military railways have followed one after another, and the destructive actions in Syria have become more intense. Many Arabs have suffered heavy penalties for this, but thousands of people continue to move forward. This is the bloody struggle of the Arabs. They believe that as long as they can overthrow the Turkish Empire, they can realize their long-cherished wish for hundreds of years.

But after the end of the war, the facts were completely beyond the Arabs' expectations. As far as the Near East is concerned, Iraq was given to Britain, Palestine was nominally under international co-management, but in fact, like Outer Jordan, it was also controlled by Britain. Saudi Arabia and Oman were also under the control of the British, and the remaining Syria became a French mandate. (To be continued)

### It is Reported that Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union are Conducting Important Negotiations: The Soviet Union Urges the Opening of a Second Battlefield Again, and the British Minister of Wartime Production Arrives in the United States

Bern, Switzerland 3 (Havas): Newspapers here all carry news from London, claiming that although the war on the Eastern Front and in North Africa is becoming increasingly fierce, Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union are still conducting important negotiations to discuss various post-war issues. The Geneva Newspaper stated that the main purpose of Britain and the United States is to make the Soviet Union support the Atlantic Charter, because the principles stipulated in this charter do not completely coincide with the views of the Soviet Union. In order to make the Soviet government understand the views of Britain and the United States on the new world after the war, the governments of Britain and the United States intend to satisfy the Soviet Union's wishes in spirit or in other aspects, including recognizing that the coastal countries of the Baltic Sea will be incorporated into the Soviet Union's territory in the future. The United States' declaration of war on Hungary, Bulgaria, and Romania is also a gesture to win the Soviet Union's favor. Recently, The Times published an article, strongly stating that the Atlantic Charter cannot only be the basis for economic concepts, but its main point is to urge the Soviet Union to agree to the principle that "all ethnic groups should enjoy the right to self-determination and autonomy." In addition, Lord Cranborne recently gave a speech in the House of Lords, saying that now is not the time for the British government to announce its war aims. The reason why Cranborne kept silent was probably because the British-American allies and the Soviet Union were still in talks.

### Indian Authorities Plan to Abolish Polygamy

Lisbon 4th (Associated Press): According to news from Sri Delhi today, polygamy in India was originally permitted by Indian customs, but in civil law only monogamy is recognized as valid. Now the Indian authorities intend to pass a law to completely abolish polygamy, so that only monogamy is recognized in religious aspects. In addition, they also intend to promote women's rights, so that in some parts of India, where women are originally restricted from inheriting inheritance, the status of women is improved.

Washington, 3rd (Havas): According to well-informed sources, the Soviet Union has recently urged Britain and the United States to open a second battlefield in Europe this year. The Soviet government has expressed satisfaction with the large-scale bombing of Germany by British aircraft, but believes that it is still insufficient, as it cannot force Germany to transfer troops from the Eastern Front. The Soviet Union believes that it may not be able to resist the offensive of the million-strong army this summer by its own efforts alone, but it is convinced that if

Washington, 3rd (Havas): Officials announced today that British Minister of Wartime Cabinet Production, Richard Leese, has arrived here. Regarding the unification of production between Britain and the United States, Mr. Lee will discuss with the US Wartime Production Board Chairman Nelson and the People's Aid Law Implementation Commissioner Hopkins. According to official sources, Leese's trip may be related to the issue of opening a second battlefield in Europe.

### Explosion at a Mexican Ammunition Factory

### Two Tram Lines To Connect With Hongkou Today; One Line To Bazitang, The Other To Zhoujiazui; Tram Fares In Both Concessions To Increase Simultaneously Starting Today

The English "Great Beauty Evening News" reported that traffic in the Public Concession would see improvement tomorrow (the 5th), as trams will run directly from Jing'an Temple to Hongkou Park, and from the southern end of the Bund, via the Waibaidu Bridge, to Zhoujiazui. This marks the first time since August 1937, eliminating the public's inconvenience of walking across the bridge. Simultaneously, tram fares in the Public Concession will double, payable in Central Reserve Bank notes (儲備券), whether south or north of the Suzhou River. This tram connection to Hongkou is a joint effort between the Public Concession Tram Company and the China Public Bus Company. Route 1 runs from Jing'an Temple to Hongkou Park, and Route 8 runs from the Bund to Zhoujiazui. Furthermore, trams will now be divided into two classes: the first car, whether in the blue or white section, will be first class; third class is limited to the trailer car. It is heard that the fare increase for third class will not be as significant as for first class. As for the French Concession's trams and trolleybuses, notices of the new Central Reserve Bank note fares, effective tomorrow, have been posted. It is noted that French Concession tram fares were increased just a few weeks ago. Now, calculated in Central Reserve Bank notes, the fare reduction is minimal, but the French tram company no longer accepts fen (分) coins, so fares may increase slightly by five fen to round up to the nearest jiao (角). The French Lei (雷) Tram Company will also accept undamaged jiao notes from the Central Bank of China (中中交) and the Bank of Communications (三行). It is heard that since the public bus and tram fares in the French Concession increased sharply starting Monday, ridership has decreased significantly, especially on public buses, which have seen a substantial drop in passengers.

New Fares Increased By Three Times

The Shanghai Tram Company also issued a notice yesterday, stating that due to rising electricity costs and the general increase in prices of other goods, the company has no choice but to revise its fares starting today (the 5th). The new fare schedule is expected to be displayed in the vehicles today for passengers to view. These new fares are based on reserve notes, but passengers can still pay with Chinese National Currency (法幣) at a rate of two-to-one until the 8th of this month. Details of the new fare schedule were not yet available at the time of writing. However, according to a company employee, the first-class fare will be about three times the old fare, while the third-class fare increase will not be as significant. Moreover, there is no fixed standard for this price increase; the lowest third-class fare is 1.5 jiao (reserve notes), and the highest is 4.5 jiao. The lowest first-class fare is 3 jiao, and the highest is 7 jiao. In addition, the company's monthly passes, originally priced at 32 yuan and 22 yuan in national currency, will now also be collected in reserve notes.

Tram Lines Connecting the North and South Areas

At the same time, the company announced that it will resume operation of Route 1 (Jing'an Temple to Hongkou Park) and Route 8 (Outer Yangjing Bridge to Yangshupu) starting today. Around 5:00 AM this morning, trams from the south of the Suzhou River and Hongkou will begin their first connection in five years since the Shanghai war. The rumble of trams will once again be heard on the Waibaidu Bridge. Furthermore, according to reporter inquiries, the Jing'an Temple tram depot will dispatch 18 trams to operate on Route 1, each with a second-class trailer car. The fare for the entire line from Jing'an Temple to Bazitang in Hongkou Park will be 7 jiao for first class and 4.5 jiao for third class. As for Route 8, it will be connected to the concession by the China Public Bus Company, and its vehicles will also be dispatched from the Hongkou area.

More Vehicles For The Convenience Of Citizens

According to the person in charge of the company, after the north-south connection is established, there will be approximately 95 trams (including trailer cars) and over 125 trolleybuses operating on all major lines starting today. With the gradual decrease in available transportation, the only affordable means of transportation is the tram. As for how to improve passenger congestion, there is currently no good solution due to the imbalance between the number of people and vehicles.

Tram Fares Equal To Car Fares

Compared to the era when passengers used copper coins, there is a world of difference in fares compared to now. In the past, when copper coins were converted to silver dollars, the company's daily revenue was about 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. Now, calculated in Central Reserve Bank notes, daily revenue has increased to 160,000 to 170,000 yuan. Although revenue has increased significantly, expenses have increased more than tenfold. For example, employee salaries alone have increased about eight to nine times, and the cost of supplies has increased by as much as several dozen times. Therefore, in terms of overall operation, it is not as good as before. As for passengers, riding the tram today is equivalent to hiring a car in the past.

Passengers Should Maintain Order When Boarding and Alighting

In addition, the tram company authorities stated that all passengers should maintain order when boarding and alighting. Those wishing to travel first class should board the front car at the driver's gate, while those traveling third class should board the trailer car at the rear, proceeding in an orderly manner to avoid crowding and reducing accidents. All passengers are requested to pay attention.

French Concession Tram Accepts Central Reserve Bank Notes

In addition, after the French Concession Tram and Lighting Company announced the cessation of accepting old national currency, tram fares have changed again, and starting today (the 5th), they will be based on Central Reserve Bank notes. The latest fare schedule was posted on all vehicles yesterday for passengers' information. According to reporter inquiries, the new fares are based on halving the national currency fares set on June 1 and converting them to Central Reserve Bank notes. If the conversion to Central Reserve Bank notes results in a remainder of five fen, another five fen will be added to round up to the nearest jiao, so fares will be slightly higher than before. The lowest third-class fare is one jiao in Central Reserve Bank notes, the lowest first-class fare is three jiao, and the highest first-class fare is seven jiao. Public bus fares have also been similarly converted to Central Reserve Bank notes. Furthermore, according to the English "Shanghai Times," the company authorities have instructed all ticket sellers to stop accepting all large national currency notes of one yuan or more, but auxiliary jiao notes from the Central Bank of China (中中交) and the Bank of Communications (三行) will still be accepted, while all fen notes will be refused.

### Domestic Remittance Handling Fees To Be Revised; Regulations On Collecting Various Handling Fees

### Hotel and Photography Industries Demand Salary Increase; Negotiations Have Not Yet Yielded Results

The entire staff of the Shanghai Hotel Industry Workers' Union recently made a request to the management for improved treatment, as the cost of living has increased and their original income is insufficient to make ends meet. After one round of negotiations, no resolution was reached due to differing conditions. Another negotiation was scheduled for the afternoon before yesterday, but the management representative was absent without notice, resulting in no progress.

Furthermore, the staff of photography studios in this city made a request for a salary increase at the beginning of last month due to the high cost of living. At that time, it was the beginning of the period for citizens to have their ID photos taken, and all the stores were extremely busy. Therefore, the management requested the staff's agreement to first increase the rice subsidy to 180 yuan per month, and to discuss the salary increase issue after the citizen ID photos were completed. Now that the workload in the stores has eased slightly, the management scheduled negotiations to be held yesterday. However, the labor representative was absent without notice, resulting in no progress. Negotiations will be rescheduled for another date.

### Various Old Auxiliary Currency Notes Temporarily Allowed to Circulate

The Provisional Joint Committee of the Silver Coin Industry Association of this city has recently learned that small merchants and public utilities in this city are refusing to accept old auxiliary currency notes other than those issued by the Central Bank of China (中中交) and the Bank of Communications (三行), causing difficulties in making change in the market. They have sent a letter to the Old Currency Consolidation Committee and notified all association members. The reply is recorded below: It has been verified that the old auxiliary currency notes mentioned in Article 5 of the Regulations for Consolidating Old National Currency and Article 1 of the Detailed Measures for Recovering Old National Currency include all types of old auxiliary currency notes. Small merchants in this city and others do not understand the meaning of the articles and are refusing to accept old auxiliary currency notes other than those issued by the Central Bank of China (中中交) and the Bank of Communications (三行), causing difficulties in making change. This is a misunderstanding and should be immediately notified to the association members.

Regarding the issue of the circulation of old auxiliary currency notes, according to regulations, they are temporarily allowed to circulate at half the value of Central Reserve Bank auxiliary currency notes. However, the market still refuses to accept auxiliary currency notes of one jiao, two jiao, and five jiao, as well as one yuan, five yuan, and ten yuan notes issued by the Farmers Bank of China. It is heard that the Silver Coin Industry has requested that the Farmers Bank of China auxiliary currency notes be allowed to circulate to facilitate transactions in various industries. It is heard that the principle has been accepted, and they will be allowed to circulate at half the value of Central Reserve Bank auxiliary currency notes, with a formal announcement to be made soon. The disposal method for old Farmers Bank of China banknotes of one yuan or more will be determined separately, with the aim of reducing losses for the people.

### Shanghai Telephone Company Adjusts Telephone Prices; Effective from June 1

According to the Allied News Agency, the Shanghai Telephone Company, which is under Japanese administration, will implement new adjusted prices starting from June 1. It has been decided to increase the current telephone fees, which are calculated in old national currency, by more than four times, and then halve them to collect reserve notes. The prices are as follows (calculated in reserve notes): New telephone installation: 50 yuan; Relocation outside the house: 50 yuan; Relocation inside the house: 20 yuan; Change of telephone number: 20 yuan; Installation fee for adding a telephone: 20 yuan; Public payphone: 0.2 jiao per call; Connecting to Zhabei telephone: 0.3 jiao per call; Business telephone: 26 yuan (ordinary phone), 28 yuan (table phone), limited to 100 calls per month. Additional calls beyond 100 per month: 0.18 jiao per call; Residential telephone: 17 yuan (ordinary phone), 19 yuan (table phone), limited to 65 calls per month. Additional calls beyond 65 per month: 0.18 jiao per call. Regarding the adjustment of telephone charges, the company stated that since the Greater East Asia War, the number of telephone subscribers has decreased by about 1,000, and the number of calls has also decreased by more than 30%. The decrease in revenue and the increase in commodity prices have led to an increase in expenses. The company's monthly revenue and expenses cannot be offset, resulting in significant losses. The charges for public utilities in the concession and all charges are calculated in reserve notes. Therefore, the telephone company's expenses are naturally also calculated in reserve notes. In order to improve the telephone system in the Shanghai area in the future, the required expenditure is expected to increase.

### Selling Rationed Flour for Profit

Illegal Behavior of Chairman of the Cooked Food and Fried Cake Industry Association, etc.

The Shanghai Special Municipality Cooked Food and Fried Cake Industry Association, located at No. 83, Maidie'an Road, Grand Bell, French Concession, has a total of 107 members. The membership fee is 2 yuan in national currency per member per month. Each member registered and was approved by the French Concession Food Management Committee. Each member was entitled to one bag of rationed flour, priced at 50 yuan, which was distributed by the association. However, the chairman of the association, Jia Ruwang, colluded with the accountant, Luo Ziliang, and employees Jiang Shunkang and Wu Jun, etc., to take out the flour. Only 71 bags were delivered to the members, and the remaining 36 bags were sold to others at a high price of 150 yuan per bag for joint profit sharing. This was discovered by members who had not yet received their flour and reported to the French police station. Detectives Ke Enqing, etc., arrested Jia, Luo, Jiang, and Wu. After investigation, the police station transferred the four people to the court. The French Concession administrative authorities filed a public lawsuit against them for joint embezzlement and fraud. When questioned, the defendants confessed to the charges. The court ordered that the case needed further investigation, and the defendants were remanded in custody pending further investigation. The defendants' request for bail was denied.

### Performance of Shakespeare's "Richard III" by the Amateur Dramatic Club (A.D.C.) for Westerners Staying in Shanghai

— White Bear

The early summer sun seems to have arrived in Shanghai for the first time this year (for one day). As the reporter faced her and set off for the Lyceum Theatre at the intersection of Malixi Road and Pushi Road, a wave of heat swept over me, and the dazzling sunlight shone before my eyes. I don't know why I had such a feeling—it seemed as if the rainy season had passed, and as if the plum rain was still lurking, no, the rainy season hadn't even arrived yet? As I stepped into the old home of the historic A.D.C. theatre company—the Lyceum Theatre—fantasy took over my entire mind.

It wasn't until I heard the protagonist playing Richard, E. G. Smith-Wright, read the second line of the script sonorously—"...Made Glorious Summer by This Sun of Your..."—that I seemed to be awakened and noticed the object of my visit—the performance of "Richard III."

This is the street scene of London, and at that time Richard was only the Duke of Gloucester. In this opening monologue, we knew his ambition, and the "play" continued from here.

The whole play is divided into four acts and seventeen scenes. With the A.D.C. theatre company, which has a 75-year history of performing in Shanghai, staging this famous play by Shakespeare, the effect is naturally quite successful. Coupled with the improvement of modern material conditions, the representation of this historical drama is not only ten thousand times better than the performance on Shakespeare's own circular grass stage Globe Theatre, but also compared to the A.D.C. theatre company's own first performance of "Faust" here in 1867, they themselves would probably boast, "We've made a lot of progress!"

Because the script itself is about the birth and fall of Richard III, the so-called "The Life and Death of The Sovereign," the "play" of the whole play should focus on the protagonist playing Richard III.

### Polish-Jewish Painter Holds Exhibition

### Shanghai Dance Hall Bloodshed; Inspector Xue Beat Dance Guest Chen Yunlai to Death

The major bloodshed that occurred on the 2nd night at the Shanghai Dance Hall at No. 440 Guangdong Road has resulted in the arrest of three people by the police: the hall's dance girl class leader Lou Minwei and tea servant Shao Amao, etc. The details have been recorded in this newspaper. Furthermore, detectives Liu Junjie and Chen Junfeng of the Lao Zha Police Station have arrested Xue Zhaoxiong, a Shanghai native (father's name Lin Lin) who was the hall's inspector. According to the investigation, the cause of the incident was roughly that a bank employee named Lin Siqing was in love with Shen Mei'ang, a dance girl in the hall. That night, he invited Chen Yunlai (deputy manager of Dechang Bank at No. 180 Minhang Road), who was later killed, and Sun Meitao, Zhou Jianming, and Chen Shugang to the dance hall to have fun. He ordered Shen Mei'ang to sit with them. Unexpectedly, another person suddenly danced with Shen during her sitting time. Lin believed that this violated the dance hall rules and was related to his own reputation, so he negotiated with the dance girl class leader Lou Minwei. Unexpectedly, Lou protected Shen and the other dance guest, causing a conflict. Xue Linlin, without asking the reason, took an iron rod and, together with Shao Amao, etc., violently attacked Lin and the others, causing Chen Yunlai to die and the others to be injured. Currently, the police are still conducting a thorough investigation of the case. Once the investigation is complete, the matter will be dealt with.

### Post Office Strictly Prevents Stamps Being Smuggled in Letters

### The Strong Prevail Over the Real: The Bond Market Advances Unabated

The over-the-counter market for public bonds continued to rise yesterday, showing strong momentum. The trend, from beginning to end, only advanced and never retreated, demonstrating even better conditions. The influx of buyers was strong and energetic, which was unexpected given the current environment and large-scale selling by major players. The financial community's focus on buying without selling was not solely due to loose monetary policy. Since April, the amount of circulating capital has invisibly increased by sixty to seventy million, and the buyers have not shrunk back despite the large supply of capital. This phenomenon is not just ordinary buying and selling; there must be a special outlet. Among the five types of public bonds, Class C bonds are in the highest demand, so their market price is also particularly high. The opening market price was one yuan to one yuan several jiao higher. The firmness of the market continued unabated, further highlighting the failure of the "real goods" faction to defeat the "strong" faction. As it gradually approaches the decisive stage, we shall observe what follows. Yesterday, Lianhe led the buying, followed by Shuntai Defu Yuanhe Wenkang. Others, including Yitai Hongxing Dazhong Qianyi Hengxing Yongkang Tongshun, as well as scattered retail investors, were all buying in succession. If it weren't for Tongli's outflow, wouldn't the market price have reached its peak? In addition to Tongli, Jiufeng Yiji's capital outflow was also significant yesterday. Others, such as Hu Heji Tongyuan Xinjie Hongda Yongkang, also had sellers. The trend did not appear to have even a small correction. As a result, the market prices of all bonds rose again by one yuan and five jiao to two yuan and eight jiao, with a total transaction volume of over five million yuan. A concise table is listed below:

Category | Highest | Lowest | Closing | Compared to Previous Day
---|---|---|---|---
Unified A | 35.20 | 34.00 | 34.80 | Up 1.50
Unified B | 34.00 | 33.00 | 32.80 | Up 2.80
Unified C | 34.50 | 32.80 | 34.10 | Up 2.10
Unified D | 32.00 | 29.80 | 21.70 | Up 2.70
Unified E | 33.00 | 32.00 | 33.00 | Up 2.00

### Talk of Control Rises Again, Cotton Yarn Falls Sharply, Shuangma Factory Enters the 5,000 Yuan Threshold Individually

The cotton yarn market continued its downward trend. This is because the talk of control on the market is even more prevalent, which has made the bulls uneasy and release their holdings. Therefore, the market is gradually going downstream. 42s Blue Phoenix was at 9,250 yuan to 8,670 yuan, closing at 8,900 yuan. 42s Tiannv at 8,050 yuan, 42s Yanghe at 8,950 yuan, 32s Xiantao at 8,050 yuan to 7,750+ yuan, 4s Sun at 8,400 yuan, 20s Blue Phoenix at 5,050 yuan, 20s Fengnian at 4,700 yuan, 20s Shuangma at 5,000 yuan, 20s Jinta at 4,500 yuan, 16s Diqiu at 5,000 yuan, 6s Zi Hu at 5,350 yuan, 6s Xiongfeng at 5,150 yuan, 10s Tongzijun at 3,600 yuan, 10s Shuang Diqiu at 3,400 yuan, 10s Hongshi Yi at 3,700 yuan.

### Longtou Fine Cloth Breaks the 200 Yuan Threshold

The factory cloth market was sluggish yesterday, because actual sales were stagnant, so many floating orders continued to be released. 16-pound Diqiu coarse cloth was at 190 yuan, Feihong at 185 yuan, each falling 10 yuan per bolt. 12-pound Diqiu fine cloth was at 165 yuan, Dapeng at 160 yuan, Fugui at 155 yuan, a drop of 7 to 8 yuan. Peach Lady Lin opened at 270 yuan, went up to 266 yuan, and then the market rebounded in eastern bolts, still selling at 270 yuan, a drop of 13 yuan. Changshou Prefecture silk was at 6.5 yuan, Volleyball yarn Prefecture silk at 4 yuan, with few transactions.

Eastern Cloth: Initially fell and then rebounded. The new Longtou order has broken the 200 yuan threshold. However, the situation was stable at closing, and it should be able to stabilize. The new order for 12-pound Longtou fine cloth opened at 204 yuan, fell to 192 yuan, and then the industry turned from selling to buying, and the afternoon closing rose directly to 199 yuan, and after the closing there were buyers at 100 yuan off the market.

### Panic in the Market, Gold Prices Plunge

Yesterday, the spot gold market began in darkness, with a sudden and drastic drop in prices. The price had retreated to the 20,000 yuan threshold, and the morale of all parties suddenly turned weak. After the news of control in the cotton yarn market spread, the bulls panicked and sold off, and there was also a large amount of selling from the Tianjin gang. The opening price in the morning for each piece (ten taels) was 21,200 yuan, the same as the closing price of the previous day. A certain firm acted as an agent for the financial community with very good gains, and three securities firms acting as agents for the Tianjin gang repeatedly sold off. Rumors of interest gains suddenly arose, and silver firms and spot gold firms sold and sold, and the market price plummeted by 1,600 yuan in a state of supply exceeding demand, breaking into the 20,000 yuan mark, reaching a low of 19,600 yuan. Another securities firm and a certain gang and spot gold firms re-entered, raising it to 20,150 yuan, and finally the Tianjin gang was seen selling off. The afternoon closing was 19,950 yuan, a difference of 1,250 yuan smaller than the previous day's closing, with a difference of 1,600 yuan. There were buyers at 20,000 yuan after the closing.

The price of gold jewelry per liang in silver shops was 100 yuan less for both Daxin and its peers, calculated as 2,200 yuan (200 yuan less for purchases).

The US dollar also retreated to 27 yuan, the Hong Kong dollar to 2.5 yuan, and military notes to 5.45 yuan. Yesterday's new exchange rate for drafts was about 10 yuan for every 1,000 yuan, mostly flat. The interest rate for the money industry association was 1.5 jiao in the morning. The price difference between new and old currencies has been narrowed down. Money shops collected at 2 yuan and sold at 2.04 yuan.

### Mixed Grain Market Prices

Yesterday's transaction of mixed grains was still good, the sentiment was still considered good, but the market prices were quite mixed. In general, red beans saw a rise of about 10 yuan, corn increased by 7 to 8 yuan, and the rest showed firmness. Only soybean cake was slightly lax and slightly softened. The overall market sold Chongming sand red beans 210 bags, old currency price 296 yuan to 308 yuan, self-delivery, fork sand yellow 147 bags, 310 yuan self-delivery, and sand silkworms 80 bags, new currency 82 yuan to 80 yuan, Nanjing cowpea 30 bags, price old currency 278 yuan, Zhangjiakou tea beans 50 bags, 370 yuan, Wuhu corn four carts, old currency 195+ yuan to 200 yuan delivered, Nanjing corn one cart, new currency 98 yuan, Xingji soybean cake June-July old warehouse order 1,000 pieces, new currency 38 yuan to 38.5 yuan, and February new warehouse order 500 pieces, 43 yuan, April new warehouse order 1,500 pieces, 44 yuan to 45 yuan, May new warehouse order jin 100 pieces, 45.2 yuan, Fengji cake month warehouse order 310 pieces, 42.5 yuan.

Yesterday, it was heard that the company opened a few boxes of Chao Bian tail, with a price of 555 yuan in military notes, also a new record.

### Qielike Cigarettes: 110 Yuan per Can

The selling price of upper-class cigarettes of various brands has been rising endlessly. Because the factory does not produce them, the stock is running out day by day. Those who hold the goods are hoarding them for speculation, and the market price is skyrocketing. For example, 50-stick Qielike has been sold for 110 yuan per can, which shows how high the price is. The price of 50-stick packages of 10,000 sticks is recorded below: Da Nanwei 20,000 yuan, Qielike 22,000 yuan, Three-Five Brand 19,500 yuan, Da Paotai 12,500 yuan, Xiao Paotai 9,600 yuan, Da Qianmen 21,700 yuan, Ten-stick Da Qianmen 3,700 yuan, Da Paotai 8,700 yuan, Xiao Paotai 4,800 yuan, 110-stick package Da Nanwei 265 yuan, Da Qian Dou 75 yuan, Shiguan Brand 60 yuan, Lao Han Brand 160 yuan, Zeng Lingpai 78 yuan.

### Sugar Shares Fall by More Than 10 Yuan

Yesterday's sugar market trend was flat and weak, and there were few spot transactions. However, there were slight transactions in sugar shares. In the morning, the raw sugar share was called 300 yuan but no transaction was made. By the afternoon, the two sides were deadlocked, and the price finally fell back, closing at 289 yuan, down more than 10 yuan.

Spring and Autumn

### How to Suppress Prices

— Fluctuations

Because of the change in the currency system, the market is really alarmed several times a day. What is called "different market prices in the morning and evening" is now really being fulfilled.

According to regulations, the ratio of Central Reserve Bank notes to the old legal tender is two to one, but except for movie theaters or theaters, which are truly and realistically halved, which thing is not increased by several percent? Some simply add the "new legal tender" stamp to the original price.

The owner of a department store told me that his capital was 500,000 yuan. After the change of the currency system, his capital was reduced to 250,000 yuan. If the goods in the store are still priced at a ratio of two to one, wouldn't he lose 250,000 yuan? Therefore, secretly raising prices after nominally lowering them is indeed a last resort. At first, I nodded and sympathized with his statement, and then I thought that his store has been open for at least four years. In these four years, it is inevitable that he has only made money and not lost money, and his capital has already become commodities. Even if there is some circulating capital in hand or deposited in the bank, how can the loss in the currency system compare to the surplus in the goods?

The facts are in front of us, and all the reasons are superfluous. Now it is only the poor who get poorer and the rich who get richer. Let me give another example. An old man who lives on interest from savings said with tears in his eyes: My savings are getting less and less, but the cost of living has risen 30 to 50 times! Can you say that this is not a fact?

Now is still the time of transition between the old and new currencies. When the old legal tender is completely discontinued, I think there will be greater changes in the market. Therefore, how to suppress prices is at a final juncture.

### Thoughts on the Closure of School-Shops

— Kuangcheng

Recently, a disturbance occurred in a primary school in the French Concession. Although the reasons are complex, the profit-seeking owners of school-shops cannot help but feel a sense of shared misfortune. Today, it seems impossible to have both education and business acumen.

In recent years, the owners of school-shops have been quite prominent. Having a small alley school in hand is not a problem for making money. A principal who knows how to plan can make a lot of money!

Life is changing, and prices are constantly rising. At the same time, we still have to ration rice and coal... Students are not only unable to afford to study, but also have no time to study: and many people have returned to their hometowns. The number of students this semester has decreased by one-third, and the situation in the next semester is even more unimaginable. Most people think that it is fortunate to fill their stomachs, and put schooling behind them. This makes the owners of school-shops feel uneasy.

On the teacher's side, the salary is still more than 100 yuan today, calculated on the basis of ten months per semester. Unless chalk dust can satisfy hunger, they have hope of living. The teachers have left the life of teaching and changed careers, and the rest are just muddling through one day at a time. At the end of the month, they routinely make a request to the principal for a salary increase, and then the inability to hire good teachers has become a difficult problem for the principals.

In some schools, although the principals are shrewd and try their best to save expenses, and even dismiss the school servants, and the miscellaneous tasks are done by the teachers and students, the income is greatly reduced, and there is no perfect solution.

A friend of mine, Mr. Someone, is a thorough educational businessman. A few years ago, he rented a shikumen house and opened a small alley school. There are only two classrooms, and the third floor is rented out at a good price. There are only two teachers, and all the school affairs are entrusted to a loyal and reliable

Life Report

### Checking and Disinfecting Milk

— Only

I am a small employee of a milk company. Before dawn, it is time for me to get up and distribute milk. The milk deliverers from all districts are waiting for me with bicycles. Counting the bottles is the most cumbersome thing, because the number is large and it is easy to overlook and count wrong. If it is less, the milk deliverer will come to you to ask for it; but if it is more, they will not say anything and just let it pass. So the one who suffers when settling the account is me. After distributing the milk, another day's work is to go to the air-conditioned room to count the amount of milk in stock. The temperature in the air-conditioned room is more than 30 degrees Celsius, which is a very uncomfortable cold temperature. If you wear less clothes, you will easily catch a cold, especially in hot weather. After staying in the air-conditioned room for half an hour, you can rest and sleep. Around 8 o'clock, it is time for the milk deliverers to come back. They will report which households have stopped delivering and which have added deliveries. Sometimes the municipal bureau draws a bottle of milk from the milk deliverers and takes it to the health department for testing. A few days later, a report is given to us. If the bacteria exceeds the predetermined number, we will be warned. If the boss is warned, he will blame us for not paying attention to the burning of milk. How can we pay attention to it? Milk is steamed with steam to 145 degrees to kill the germs. This is the principle of disinfection. The disinfected milk is cooled by the air-conditioned mess plate, and then put into the bottling machine, and then bottling starts. These bottles also have to go through several procedures first. Bottling is very fast under the skilled technicians. After a semi-mechanical continuous project, two or three thousand bottles can be completed. After my checking. The key to the air-conditioned room is my talisman, and it must always be on my body, and the responsibility for loss is great. Because the locks are very special and not easy to match. After that, the remaining time is to make the milk room report and the production table. With the rising prices, milk has also undergone several price increases. But Shanghai seems to be a place without poor people. With the constant ringing of the phone, the number of drinkers is increasing by sixty to seventy households a day, which makes us speechless.

### Good Deeds

— Xie

Buying at high prices and selling at flat prices.

The Dean of Academic Affairs, he himself is working hard all day long on hoarding, because using the school to hoard paper and stationery is both convenient and easy to get cheap.

At the beginning of this semester, the profit was reduced by half, and there was no prospect of running a school. This boss, who knows how to plan, made up his mind that he could close the school after the summer vacation. Fortunately, there is a house, and being a second landlord will not be bad.

Recently, he has been completely disappointed. The second landlord is now plummeting. If he collects tips, he will be sued, and overcharging rent is also a long way off.

After calculating and calculating, he felt that if this primary school was to continue, unless the tuition fee was doubled, even if there were fewer students, there would be a surplus. In fact, the tuition fee had already risen to an unbearable level, and doubling it would simply be unpopular. So he changed his mind and transferred the school to make money and do other business.

The school-shop owners can no longer make their wishful thinking. They lack the spirit of running education on weekdays, and now they have suffered this blow, so they simply quit. Many schools announced their closure at the end of this semester, and mostly ignored the problem of students dropping out of school.

Although we don't have to gloat, this kind of commercialized school closure is not a loss to society. What is a pity is that at the same time, the public is concerned about the unemployment of teachers and the loss of schooling of students.

### Riding the Storm Together

— Hejia Branch

(5) Coming and Going

Mrs. Cai Er said: "This was made for her by your mother. It is a deep blue silk fabric. She couldn't bear to wear it, so she kept it in our house. I said she wanted to go to Shanghai, maybe half of it was because she had this dress." Wei Cheng's face showed some smiles again. Mrs. Ye Er had a younger sister who was not married and was sick at home. Mrs. Ye Er had been busy with Mrs. Ye Da's funeral all this time, and had not gone back to see her once; now that she was free, she wanted to see her. Wei Cheng said: "Aunt, go back and see Second Aunt. There is nothing at home, and if there is anything, I can deal with it." In a few days, it will not rain, and there will be things to do in the fields when it rains. Take the small boat from your own home, and Hezi will row the boat. Aunt does not have to rush back. It doesn't matter if you stay at Uncle Zhang's house for two or three days. Mrs. Ye Er said: "Then I will go. Wei Cheng, you stay at home and read books. If you feel bored, walk around in the yard, or else, in the open space outside. Don't go out." Wei Cheng said: "I know everything." Although Mrs. Ye Er left, she still told Magpie, told Mother He, and told Ah Xing, all of them to be careful about the young master's affairs: and then let He Zixing row the boat and go back to her mother's house ten miles away.

Wei Cheng stood foolishly in front of the portraits of his parents, standing for less than a minute, when Magpie said behind him, "The Second Mrs. told the young master to read books, young master, read your books." Wei Cheng said: "You don't care about my affairs." He walked to the room where Guofang and Cuizhen lived every other night, and saw that the bottle of Xuehua flower cream was open, and the bottle cap was thrown far away on the window. He picked up the bottle of Xuehua flower cream and smelled it, and his heart swayed. Magpie said again behind him: "The Second Mrs. told the young master to walk around in the big fight, how did the young master come here?" Wei Cheng said: "You want to take care of my affairs again. You don't come to clean up the cosmetics that the young ladies have used."

The next day, Wei Cheng was planning how to improve the spring ploughing method this year by himself, and drew a picture of all the fields in his home. There is the river channel, there are trees, that piece is open space, and that piece is wheat field. The wheat field is painted with wheat, and the open space is left blank. After drawing for a while, he wanted to smoke a cigarette, and put a cigarette in his hand. Ah Yu suddenly chuckled and struck a match to light it for him. Wei Cheng said: "You are in the house, I don't know." Ah Xing smiled and said: "Young Master, what are you drawing? Last time when the Old Mrs. was alive, there were many painting axes hung in the house, green and red, why is the Young Master drawing only with a pencil some lines?" Wei Cheng took a puff of cigarette and said, "You don't understand, I'm not drawing, I'm drawing the fields at home. It's even better that you are here, how many acres is this in front of the old cemetery?" (94)

### Leisure and Busyness

— Chenjing

There are many relative words in the vocabulary, such as: "right and wrong", "black and white", "rich and poor"... and so on.

But sometimes suddenly "right and wrong" are unclear, and "black and white" are confused, so mankind also has the division of "rich" and "poor". Because of this, a pair of different words are also produced: "leisure" and "busyness". Some people rely on their power and wealth to live a leisurely life all day long; others are ruthlessly whipped by poverty and cold, forcing them to work hard day and night without stopping.

Today, the so-called "leisure" and "busyness" seem to have changed somewhat. On the one hand, the "leisure" are indeed more idle, so bored that they listen to operas and play with women all day and night, and the "busy" are even busier, with no chance to rest even at night, holding the quilt corner and guarding the rice shop door in fear; but on the other hand, the "leisure" are extremely quiet and think about action. In addition to drawing and playing chess, they are attracted by the market fluctuations and become red-eyed, so buying and selling injuries add a lot of unfamiliar people to the market, so the "leisure" friends start to be "busy". This "busyness" helps prices to "ascend to heaven", and the word "see rise" spreads thousands of miles. The factory owner puts down the manufactured products and does not let them go, and watches the market change again; there is no need to worry about raw materials, let them pile up like mountains, and the machine "suddenly breaks down, it is better to start work again after the repair is completed"? So the "busy" friends who have been benefiting others day and night now have to be idle.

"Leisure" and "busyness" were originally "created" by mankind, and of course their elimination still depends on mankind. The most effective way to reduce them is to try to wipe away all relative words in the dictionary.

### About Getting Up Early

— Naisheng Recorded

Those who are still sleeping when it is dawn are not great men. - Switte

Being able to get up one or two hours early every day can strengthen the body; the first teaching of health experts is to be able to get up early. - Weisen Cobley

A sleepy person is enough to weaken a person's physique. - John Joe

Getting up early can refresh the mind. - Tairs

If we can be diligent when getting up early, we can achieve twice the result with half the effort. - Hong Chuanhua

If you want to seek my longevity, it is better to save sleep. - Peter

(But in the proverbs of various countries in the world, there is still no saying "spiritual morning dance".)

(Instead of rewarding)

### Be Careful When Shopping

— Wang Zhicheng

Coming to Shanghai, the goods are expensive and speculation is good. In addition to hoarding and speculating, they are also mixing fish eyes with pearls to deceive customers, which is hateful. A friend of mine has been cheated on shopping more than once. At first, he bought kerosene but it was cold water, he bought Wan Jin Oil but it was petroleum jelly, and he bought Bagua Dan but it was a piece of plywood; what is even more hateful is that he once went to a certain egg shop to buy four raw salted eggs, and the price was very cheap, only four jiao per egg, and when he got home, he washed and cooked them, and he was shocked that they were not salted eggs at all. It was an egg shell that others had discarded, the two pieces were put together, and yellow mud was firmly stuffed inside, and yellow mud was also painted on the outside of the shell, which looked like a salted egg. He wasted 1.6 yuan in vain, and he had to admit that he was unlucky.

(Editor's note: It is true that you should be careful when buying goods, but if you are also "buying" and "hoarding", it is better to hate your own conscience.)

### Addendum

— Xie

On the 2nd, Mr. SK introduced three economic barbershops in this journal, which is really good news for small employees in this difficult time. According to what I know, I still feel that there is one place that is missing, so I specially added it.

The barbershop in the Shanghai Insurance Industry Association on the fourth floor of 160 Edward Road (Thames Building) sells membership haircut coupons, five yuan for five tickets, and five yuan for four tickets for non-members. For each haircut, give one ticket, which is actually cheaper than what Mr. SK described. To Mr. Cao Dan:

The three barbershops introduced by Mr. SK are all calculated in the old legal tender. It is not known whether they will be changed or increased in price later. This is a reply. Editorial Department

### Microscope and Telescope

— Wang Sheng

A friend of mine studies biology. He is used to using a microscope in the laboratory. Therefore, he observes everything in a "microscopic" manner.

In the past, he would often proudly tell me that nothing could hide its ugliness under a microscope. Look, those terrible microorganisms are evil demons that harm people.

However, recently he no longer smiles. The reason is that under his narrow microscopic observation, there is only ugliness, despair, and not a trace of hope for life. He was so angry that he almost threw away the microscope.

"Be reasonable," I sincerely advised him, "Everything under the microscope is indeed a fact, but it is not enough to observe with a microscope alone. Under its narrow lens, you can only see partial, one-sided reality. Pick up the microscope, and at the same time pick up the telescope, look back and then look forward into the distance. Then, so-called 'ugliness' and 'despair' are only temporary and partial phenomena. There is hope for life in the distance.”

But he still doesn't understand, "Reality is clearly ugly and desperate. Although there is a glimmer of hope for life in the distance, what is the path to reach life?"

I advised him to use the method of "X-ray" perspective to observe all the ugliness presented under the microscope, to discover the essence of the facts, and it would not be difficult to obtain the source of the ugliness and the method of eradicating it. In this way, everything would be clear, and our vision would no longer be blinded by the phenomenon.

So, this friend left his laboratory, picked up the microscope and telescope, and also grasped the method of perspective. Soon, I saw his smile again.
