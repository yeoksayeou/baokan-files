### Prime Minister Tojo Banquets Finance Minister Zhou

Tokyo, 17th, Domei News Agency: Japanese Prime Minister Tojo hosted Finance Minister Zhou and his party at the Prime Minister's official residence at noon on the 17th. On the Japanese government side, all cabinet members and the four chief cabinet secretaries, except for Naval Minister Shimada, attended. After Prime Minister Tojo delivered a speech, Mr. Zhou gave a reply. The banquet ended at a joyous atmosphere around 1:00 PM. The main points of Prime Minister Tojo's speech are as follows: China's currency problem is extremely complex and difficult to solve, but since the establishment of the Central Reserve Bank, the control over currency and finance has gradually strengthened. When the Greater East Asia War broke out, the value of the old legal currency also plummeted sharply. At this time, the method of cutting off the equivalence of the new and old legal currency was adopted, and recently the circulation of the old currency has been gradually prohibited. Therefore, today the Central Reserve Bank notes have become the only legal tender. The Empire is deeply gratified by this. Finance Minister Zhou, in his capacity as Governor of the Central Reserve Bank, is directly responsible for handling this issue and implementing it decisively. In the future, there are many financial and monetary problems that need to be solved, but I am confident that Finance Minister Zhou will take appropriate measures to deal with these problems. Our Empire will spare no effort to assist him. I sincerely hope that we can discuss all kinds of problems frankly in the future so that we can communicate with each other.

Tokyo, 17th, Haitong News Agency: As Japan holds "Anti-Espionage Week," Military Police Commander General Nakamura gave a radio broadcast, revealing the espionage activities engaged in by the British and Americans in Japan before the war. It is said that before 1940, the Tokyo correspondent of the London Daily Mail was ordered by the leader of the special operations in Singapore to come to Japan to serve as the British intelligence leader, responsible for organizing the spy network. He was chosen for this position because he was familiar with the situation in East Asia and had written anti-Japanese works. After coming to Japan, he immediately started active secret activities, establishing propaganda centers in major cities. On the one hand, he also contacted pro-British and American organizations in Japan to spy on news and collect intelligence.

### Roosevelt's Envoy, Bullitt's Visit to Britain, Rumored to be Related to Opening a Second Front

Stockholm, Sweden, 17th, Haitong News Agency: According to London sources, after President Roosevelt's special envoy Bullitt arrived in London the day before yesterday, officials only said that he would stay for several weeks. The "Standard Evening News" reported that he would discuss the Arctic convoy issue because many ships were lost in the Arctic, and a tripartite meeting will be held in the short term to discuss it. On the other hand, it is rumored that Bullitt's sudden visit to London is related to the opening of a second front.

Stockholm, Sweden, 17th, Haitong News Agency: The pro-British "Gothenburg Commercial News" correspondent in London said that the British all believe that a second front can be opened in the near future because the situation on the Eastern Front is extremely critical, and the time for the launch of the second front is about to mature.

Istanbul, 17th, Haitong News Agency: Moscow dispatch, the Soviet official agency "Pravda" wrote yesterday, advocating that the Allied countries occupy the German naval bases along the Atlantic and North Sea coasts. This would prevent the German navy from attacking the important shipping lanes between Britain and the United States. The newspaper then solemnly pointed out that the gains and losses of the Atlantic war are also of great importance to the Soviet Union. "Pravda" did not reiterate the demand for opening a second front because occupying the German naval bases is of the same benefit to the Soviet Union.

London, 16th, Havas Agency: Home Secretary Morrison publicly declared today that as long as the war crisis exists, our army will not dare to be negligent for a day. Recalling the end of the First European War, our country's military strength was originally superior, but we automatically gave up everything, which is lamentable. At this moment, the outcome of the war will obviously depend on the quality of weapons.

### U.S.-Finnish Relations Gradually Deteriorating, U.S. Government Notifies Finland to Close Consulates

Lisbon, 17th, Haitong News Agency: Washington dispatch, the US government has now decided to sever consular relations with Finland, which was announced in a statement issued by US officials last night.

Lisbon, 17th, Haitong News Agency: Recently received a Washington dispatch, US political figures believe that the US government's request for Finland to close the Finnish consulates in the US on August 1 will put the relations between the two countries in great danger. Finland has so far cooperated with Germany and fought against the Soviet Union, which has made the United States extremely dissatisfied. At the same time, the US State Department claimed that the Finnish government requested on June 17 last year that the US consuls in Finland must negotiate with the Finnish Foreign Ministry on matters that were always handled by the consuls and local officials, which is tantamount to depriving the consuls of the rights granted by the treaty and is a clear violation of international practice. Therefore, the US government notified the Finnish Foreign Ministry that all US-Finnish consulates will be closed and requested the Finnish government to close its fourteen consulates in the US.

### Turkey's Foreign Policy Will Not Change

Istanbul, 16th, Domei News Agency: At a time when the German army is controlling the Black Sea and Cairo is encountering a crisis, the movements of the countries in West Asia are attracting much attention. Especially after the sudden death of Turkish Prime Minister Saydam, what is the foreign policy of the Saracoglu cabinet? This has a significant impact on the war situation in that area, so all parties are even more concerned. The United Nations hopes that Turkey's foreign policy can turn to be pro-British because Saracoglu has always been a pro-British figure. However, in the delicate international situation, even if there are changes in cabinet members, Turkish President Ismet will continue the foreign policy of Saracoglu's time as foreign minister. Therefore, it is impossible for the new cabinet to suddenly turn to be pro-British. Moreover, the Turkish government has clearly stated that it will adhere to the policy of neutrality. Judging from the recent tough attitude of the Turkish authorities towards Britain and the Soviet Union, it can be seen that the future policy of the new Turkish cabinet will not have any impact on the Axis' West Asian policy.

### British House of Commons Discusses Merchant Ship Issue

London, 16th, Havas Agency: The House of Commons held a closed-door meeting last night to discuss the recent losses of British merchant ships and the Navy. Afterwards, the official announcement said, "The House discussed the situation of the Navy and listened to the government's report." Government representative Sir Cripps said in reply to a question from a certain member that the situation of the meeting of the House will be kept secret. The government is prepared to study a suggestion made by a certain number of members to make the public aware of the seriousness of the situation. The House of Lords also held a closed-door meeting today, following the example of the House of Commons. The government representative of the House of Lords, Viscount Cranborne, said that we have all kinds of evidence that the enemy is completely ignorant of the actual situation of our Navy, and we should adhere to this secret.

Stockholm, Sweden, 17th, Haitong News Agency London dispatch, British Labour MP Shinwell was the only member who opposed the government's decision to hold a closed-door meeting to debate the tonnage issue at yesterday's House of Commons meeting. Although Cripps announced the government's position, Shinwell did not agree. As a result, the government did not adopt his opinion.

Stockholm, Sweden, 17th, Haitong News Agency London dispatch, well-informed sources predict that when the House of Commons debates the tonnage issue today, it will discuss three major points: 1. The number of losses claimed by the United States exceeds the amount that can be produced; 2. The unification of shipbuilding policies and construction plans between Britain and the United States and the raw materials needed to supply the two countries; 3. The Labour Party's demand that the power of British shipyard production be transferred to the trade union. The "Daily Herald" commented yesterday that the Labour MPs will raise "extremely inconvenient" questions to the government during today's debate in the House of Commons. Since 1939, Britain has never opened a new shipyard, and many of the old shipyards that were closed during the economic depression have not been reopened. In the thirty months since the start of the war, British shipyards have started construction of about 500 warships, of which only 485 have joined the naval service, while during the last World War, Britain built 750 warships of all kinds.

### Underground Resources Survey in the Hinggan Mountains

Changchun, 17th, Domei News Agency: Dr. Yoshimura of the Japanese Continental Scientific Academy and his party of nine were entrusted by the Hinggan North Province to form a survey team, which has conducted a scientific survey in the Hinggan Mountains since the 19th of last month.

The survey results show that the deposits of silver and lead have also been clarified. In addition, combustible oil was found near Sanhe, and it is hoped that specialists will come again for detailed investigation. At present, the largest underground resources in Hinggan North Province are natural soda and gypsum. The thickness of the natural soda in the west reaches three meters and extends very widely, which is amazing. The quality of gypsum is quite good, and the deposits are also very rich.

### Soviet Troops Concentrated on the Banks of the Volga River, Stalin Personally Went to the Front, Adjusted Strategy to Prepare for a Decisive Battle, Germany Poured All Its Efforts to Attack Rostov

Istanbul, 17th, Domei News Agency: According to reliable sources here, Stalin has left Moscow for Stalingrad (the closest target of the German offensive in the Don River region) to personally direct the defense of this industrial city on the Volga River Bay. Soviet Chief of Staff Shaposhnikov has arrived in Stalingrad to prepare to meet with Stalin. During the absence of the Soviet leader from Moscow, his duties will be temporarily assumed by Foreign Commissar Molotov.

Stockholm, Sweden, 17th, Haitong News Agency: Reports received here say that Stalin personally went to Stalingrad to handle important matters. Stalingrad is located on the Volga River, about 400 kilometers northeast of Rostov. It is rumored that there may be changes in the supreme commander of the Soviet army. It is said that the Soviet Chief of Staff has arrived in the area. According to reports from the United States, a large Soviet army is concentrated in Stalingrad, planning to fight a decisive battle with the German army in the area.

Bern, 17th, Domei News Agency: According to news, the fierce offensive of the German army in the Don River region continues to advance toward Stalingrad, an industrial city in the Volga Bay, and Rostov, the gateway to the Caucasus on the Don River, is now in grave danger of being surrounded by the German army on the Don River front from the west and north. The German army attacking Rostov has reached 15 divisions, some of which started from Millerovo (located on the railway 115 miles north of Rostov) and Stalino. This development indicates that the area east and south of Millerovo is extremely critical for the Soviet army's defense of the Don River region and defense of Stalingrad. It was previously reported that the German army's offensive east of Millerovo had already been in the north of the Caucasus, which was later confirmed by news of the new threat to Rostov. In addition, the German army in the Boguchar area is also attacking Stalingrad. The German mechanized units in this area are advancing in areas conducive to tank formations. Moscow, 17th, Havas Agency: The Soviet Information Bureau announced this morning that the Red Army continued to engage in fierce battles with the enemy near Voronezh last night. The battle situation was fierce and has not diminished. There were no major changes in other areas of the front line. There were only fierce battles southwest of Millerovo. The Red Army was outnumbered and forced to retreat and resist in new positions, making the enemy exhausted and inflicting heavy damage on them.

Moscow, 17th, Havas Agency: "Pravda" published an editorial again today, encouraging the soldiers, saying, "Our country is facing difficult and arduous times. A battle of life and death is being fought on the front line. The situation is still extremely critical, but the Red Army soldiers recognize this crisis and will definitely fight bravely, showing their steel-like strength and determination, stopping the enemy's advance at all costs. We must fight to the last drop of blood, regardless of all costs, to stop the enemy and launch a counterattack, not allowing the enemy to pass. Our army will win."

Soviet Army Abandoned Southern Part, Launched Counter-Offensive in Voronezh

Stockholm, Sweden, 17th, Domei News Agency: Although the Red Army on the Don River front fought bravely, it was still unable to resist the German offensive. Moscow admitted yesterday that the two cities of Boguchar and Millerovo, located on the Moscow-Rostov railway line, have been abandoned. The battle is now taking place southeast of Millerovo. The plains are wide open there, surrounded by the Don River, and less than 50 miles from the important industrial area of Stalingrad. At the same time, fierce battles are still taking place in the city of Voronezh, upstream of the Don River. The Red Army is constantly counterattacking, especially on the German flanks north of the city. It is reported that the German army has had to dig trenches and defend in several places.

German Aircraft Active Over the Eastern Front, Italian Army Helping in Battle, Waiting for Opportunity to Act

Rome, 17th, Haitong News Agency: Newspapers here reported yesterday that the German army is still in hot pursuit after defeating Timoshenko's army in the southern part of the Eastern Front. According to the "Italian News", the air force is also extremely active in the area. The enemy's front line and rear are constantly being bombed, preventing the enemy from getting any respite. The railways were also destroyed and the stations were set on fire. The "Roman People's News" commented that all that Timoshenko can do now is retreat behind the Volga River.

Berlin, 17th, Haitong News Agency: The German Supreme Command announced that on Wednesday, German aircraft continued to bomb the Soviet Black Sea ports in the Caucasus. German aircraft flew through anti-aircraft fire nets in batches and dropped many bombs on their targets. A merchant ship in Sochi was hit and sunk. Several warehouses in Novorossiysk and Taman caught fire.

Rome, 16th, Domei News Agency: Italian troops operating in the Soviet Union suddenly began operations on the morning of the 14th as the Eastern Front advanced, and advanced 50 kilometers south of the Donets Basin by the night of the 15th, occupying an important industrial center in the Soviet Union. The Italian Expeditionary Force advanced to Stalino before winter, forming a threat to Rostov, waiting for an opportunity to act. The German army under General Bock continued to attack, taking advantage of the fact that the railway between Moscow and Rostov had been cut off. This time the Italian army's re-action indicates that an important operational operation in the southern Axis is about to begin, and the progress of the operations in Egypt also indicates the direction of the Axis forces, which is worth paying attention to.

### Egyptian Front Forms Seesaw Battle, British Offensive to Seize Qises Hill Repulsed

Bern, Switzerland, 17th, Domei News Agency: According to Cairo news, north of El Alamein on the Egyptian front, yesterday again fell into a fierce seesaw battle. Initially, the British army attacked with all its strength, hoping to recapture the Qises Hill. The offensive was quite successful for a while in the morning, but was then repulsed by a fierce German counterattack. The central tank battle has been going on since the 3rd, and is about to evolve into an unprecedented mechanized battle.

Cairo, 17th, Havas Agency: The British Middle East Command announced today that fierce battles on the central section of the front line continued yesterday. The enemy renewed its attempt to drive the British army off the Qattara Ridge. A major battle broke out between the two tank divisions yesterday morning. The enemy lost a number of tanks, and our losses are unknown. The battle resumed in the evening and continued until late at night. There were also battles in the northern section. The enemy in the southern section retreated slightly. Our air force assisted the army in bombing the enemy and its rear day and night.

Somewhere on the Egyptian Border, 16th, Havas Agency: Although the battle in the central section of the Egyptian border is very important in nature, it is not believed that General Rommel, Commander-in-Chief of the German Army in North Africa, is prepared to launch a large-scale offensive immediately. Reinforcements have been obtained from Greece and Crete, especially air force reinforcements. However, it is still doubtful whether its strength is sufficient to attack Alexandria. At the same time, according to reliable sources, Italian infantry units from the Balkans have also participated in the battle in the Qattara area. Allied military experts admit that the Axis forces will soon launch an all-out offensive. As for the western section of the front line from El Alamein to the Quotaara area, the British army is said to have regained two outposts, one of which was recaptured by the German army after a counterattack in the Qanaiel Essa area. As of now, the battle in that area is still a "fluid battle," purely to probe the enemy's strengths and weaknesses, not a real decisive battle. In addition, the Allied air force is also extremely active. Several American heavy bombers have participated in the bombing of Benghazi and Tobruk, as well as the Axis forward positions, especially the artillery positions.

German Forces Cross the Don River Using Assault Boats

Havas Agency, Rome, 16th Dispatch: The "Roman People's Daily" recently published an article by its war correspondent describing the German army's crossing of the Don River. The article stated in brief: The rapid advance of the German army took the Soviet forces by surprise, as they did not expect the German army to advance so quickly through the swamps, and to transport a large number of light and heavy artillery and searchlights to the front line to search for Soviet positions at midnight. The German army's crossing of the Don River was a great military feat. Prior to the operation, the German command transported a large number of "motorized assault boats" to the front line with the mechanical units. At the time, the German soldiers did not know that it was for the purpose of crossing the river. Upon reaching the destination, engineers and infantry boarded the boats in succession. When the boats reached the middle of the river, the Soviet forces opened fire. At first, the firing was aimless, but then they concentrated their fire on the German boats. At that moment, waves surged, and the boats pitched and rolled, creating a dangerous situation. However, most of the boats completed their mission and reached the left bank of the Don River. The Soviet forces then opened fire with machine guns. Two German boats were seen capsizing in response. However, a few minutes later, a phone call was received from the front line, reporting that the German troops had landed safely, losing only three assault boats. However, the soldiers on board swam to the left bank. Afterward, only fifteen soldiers were wounded and seven were killed.

### The Problem of French Warships in Alexandria - Diplomatic Documents Published - Vichy States the US Should Be Responsible for the Consequences if French Warships Are Destroyed

Havas Agency, Vichy, 16th Dispatch: Since the German army has been steadily advancing in Egypt, the disposition of the French warships anchored in the port of Alexandria has not only been the focus of worldwide attention, but also the center of back-and-forth negotiations between France and the belligerent parties. The French fleet in the port includes one battleship, four cruisers, three destroyers, and one submarine. Their future fate is clearly a concern for people all over the world. The French government therefore disclosed today all the documents exchanged with the governments of Germany, Italy, and the United States in recent days, so that the entire picture of the negotiations is clear. The full text of the statement issued by the French government today is translated below, and all the documents exchanged with the governments of the countries concerned are listed in sequence without omission.

Full Text of the Statement

"On June 26, 1942, the French government, in view of the German General Rommel's offensive in North Africa and the entry of the German-Italian Allied forces into Egypt, studied the disposition of the French warships anchored in the port of Alexandria. It immediately instructed Vice Admiral Godefroy, commander of the French fleet in the port, that if Britain abandoned Alexandria, he should lead all the warships to a French port. However, if it was practically impossible for the French warships to leave the port, they should still fly the French flag and remain in the port. Under no circumstances should the warships be allowed to fall into foreign hands. The above instructions were in full compliance with the armistice agreement and were subsequently notified to the French-German and French-Italian armistice commissions for the record. On July 1, the French head of government met with US Chargé d'Affaires Tuck and handed him a memorandum explaining the French government's attitude towards these French warships.

French Memorandum to the US

In the memorandum, the French government declared its intention to preserve these warships. It stated that France would not agree if Britain destroyed these warships before withdrawing from Alexandria. If there was any attempt to destroy the French warships, the French navy would do its utmost to resist. At the same time, Vice Admiral Godefroy was instructed not to withdraw with the British forces. If there was a situation similar to the Oran incident of July 3, 1940, serious consequences would arise. The French government hereby solemnly declares that the French warships must remain French property. This statement is in full compliance with the provisions of the armistice agreement. Under the current circumstances, the French government would be satisfied if the French warships in the port of Alexandria could freely sail to nearby French ports.

German-Italian Note to France

The German High Command and the Italian government subsequently sent a letter on July 2, acknowledging that the instructions given by the French government to Vice Admiral Godefroy were in full compliance with the armistice agreement and expressing respect for France's position. The notes submitted by Germany and Italy were notified to the US government. The content is as follows: "The German High Command believes that the instructions given by the French government to the French fleet in the port of Alexandria are in full compliance with the armistice agreement. Therefore, it provides a guarantee, stating that if it encounters French warships in the port in the future, it will abide by the provisions of Article 8 of the armistice agreement. However, this guarantee must be fully implemented if the instructions issued by the French government are fully implemented." At the same time, the Italian government also decided to abide by the armistice agreement, "Regardless, it does not want to make any demands on the French warships anchored in the port of Alexandria." When Chief Laval notified the US Chargé d'Affaires of the contents of the German and Italian notes, he stated that he hoped that the leaders of the US government would pay attention to these documents and pointed out that any violent action by Britain would inevitably cause very serious consequences. Therefore, he believed that "the US President will fully understand this situation."

US Proposes Suggestions to France

The next day, the US Chargé d'Affaires delivered a note from his country to the head of government, stating, "The US President is deeply concerned about the fate of the French warships anchored in the port of Alexandria and hopes that these warships will not fall into the hands of the German-Italian army or navy authorities. The President also hopes that these warships will be returned to France at the end of the war. Regarding this matter, the US government has been in contact with Britain and hereby proposes to the French government that the French warships in the port of Alexandria be placed under US protection. If this can be done, then the French warships should take the Suez Canal and sail to a more distant port to anchor until the end of the war. This port can be in the US or in other republics in the Americas. The US is willing to provide a promise and guarantee that these French warships will be returned to France after the war. It believes that accepting this suggestion is in the best interests of France. Conversely, if this suggestion is rejected, the British government can still order the French warships to sail through the Suez Canal. If the French warships resist, the British government can still destroy them to prevent them from falling into enemy hands. For the sake of France's honor, the US hopes that this reasonable suggestion can be accepted." Chief Laval immediately replied to the US Chargé d'Affaires, stating that the wording of this note was difficult to accept. The French government almost believed that this was not a reply from the US to the memorandum of July 2. It immediately requested the US Chargé d'Affaires Tuck to inquire with the State Department whether the US government had received the French government's memorandum when drafting this note. On July 5, US Chargé d'Affaires Tuck visited Chief Laval again, explaining that the draft of the aforementioned US note was indeed sent out before receiving the French memorandum. However, President Roosevelt insisted on his original position, so he still sent this note to the French government.

Vichy Rejects

The French government subsequently replied to the US note of July 3 on July 7, stating, "The French government has studied the US note of July 3. The difficulty in accepting its wording almost makes the French government believe that the US drafted this note without being aware of the benefits of the guarantees provided by the German and Italian governments on this matter. Because the governments of Germany and Italy have already declared that they will abide by the provisions of the armistice agreement and do not want to make any demands on the French warships in the port. The content of this guarantee was notified to the US government on July 2. Unexpectedly, the US Chargé d'Affaires verbally stated on July 5 that your government still insists on the conditions put forward in the note of July 3. This statement forces the French government to consider this matter serious. Because the US suggestion violates France's honor and interests and is naturally unacceptable to the French government. The French government is extremely willing to preserve the French warships and other transport ships in the port of Alexandria, which is understood by your government. Rumors spread by foreign propaganda agencies are not credible. The French government has never and will never be willing to hand over any warships to foreign countries. After hearing about the guarantees provided by the governments of Germany and Italy, the US should believe that the French warships in the port of Alexandria will no longer be in danger of falling into the hands of Germany and Italy. The clear and definite guarantees of Germany and Italy should have prevented the US government from taking an insulting attitude towards France. If the US government is only concerned with protecting French interests, it should not refuse the French warships to leave the port of Alexandria and sail to nearby French ports. The US government's request for our warships to sail to US ports is completely contrary to our obligations under the armistice agreement. Its statement of distrust of France is even more insulting to the dignity of the French government. This kind of suggestion is naturally difficult to accept. Does the US government believe that if the French warships in the port of Alexandria refuse to obey the orders of the British High Command, the British will have sufficient reason to destroy them? The French government must once again state that if any violence is inflicted on the French warships in the port of Alexandria, it will cause very serious consequences. The French government sees that President Roosevelt will share the heavy responsibility for destroying the French warships with those who conspire to destroy the armed warships in defiance of military honor, which is very regrettable. It is fortunate if the American people can not forget the painful events caused by the British attack on the French warships in the port of Oran in July 1940."

Second US Dispatch

The US Chargé d'Affaires then presented Chief Laval with a new US note on the 11th of this month, stating, "President Roosevelt proposes that if the French government can agree to withdraw the French warships in the port of Alexandria through the Suez Canal, then it should be granted the right to pass freely and allowed to sail to Fort-de-France, Martinique, in the French West Indies to anchor. The British and US governments are willing to guarantee not to use them and not to move them during the war. All situations should be the same as the French warships currently anchored in Fort-de-France. And a guarantee should be provided that these warships will be returned to France together after the war. As for the sailors of each ship, the British and US governments have agreed to send them back to their country in accordance with the situation when each warship was in the port of Alexandria. The US government also proposes that the above measures should be decided regardless of the current situation in the port of Alexandria, because in any case, the French warships in the port are in danger of being attacked."

Vichy Rejects Again

Chief Laval then notified the US on the 13th, rejecting the above proposal, for three reasons: The French-German and French-Italian armistice agreements all clearly stipulate that French warships must be anchored in French ports in any case. The French-Italian armistice agreement even states that French warships must be concentrated in French mainland ports. Germany and Italy have both guaranteed to abide by the armistice agreement and declared that they will never detain the French warships in the port of Alexandria in the future. Moreover, for the past two years, the various provisions regarding the French fleet in the armistice agreement have always been strictly observed by Germany and Italy. There is also no reason for France to declare the abolition of these provisions. Now that the British government has publicly announced that if France refuses the US proposal, the British army will sink the French fleet in the port of Alexandria, the US government seems to have tacitly approved this action. Therefore, the French government believes that if extremely serious consequences are caused by this matter in the future, the responsibility should be borne by the US.

### China and Communications Banks Decide on Resumption Plan - Reportedly Scheduled to Open on September 1 - Methods for Withdrawing Deposits from Banks and Individuals Determined

The reorganization and resumption of business of the China and Communications Banks, which are separating from the head office, has been organized by the Sino-Japanese Joint Committee for Handling the China and Communications Banks to prepare for the resumption of business. Now, the Joint Committee has decided on the handling of the shares of the two banks, as well as the disposal of previous loans and deposits.

Focus on Commercial Banking Business

After the resumption of business, the privilege of issuing currency will be cancelled, and the banks will focus on ordinary commercial banking business. Necessary adjustments will be made to the personnel of the two banks. Existing employees will be allowed to continue to work. The directors, supervisors, and assistant managers after the reorganization will be appointed separately. It is reported that the resumption of business is scheduled for September 1. The original branches and offices in Shanghai and various parts of Central China will all resume business in accordance with the prescribed methods. Previous old legal currency deposits will be converted into Central Reserve Certificates at a ratio of two to one.

Withdrawals of Old Currency Deposits Approved

After the resumption of business, withdrawals or continued deposits will be allowed. As for the interbank deposits of various Chinese banks, money houses, and money industry reserve warehouses in the China and Communications Banks before December 8 of last year, a solution has also been negotiated. However, before the resumption of business, although the two banks are temporarily closed to the public, they are still open internally. In order to protect the interests of depositors, with the permission of the Japanese supervisor, old currency deposits of depositors are allowed to be converted into Central Reserve Certificates for restricted withdrawals, stipulating that each household can withdraw 300 yuan per month.

### Citizen Certificates to Be Issued Next Month

The Central, New Gate, Old Gate, Gordon, Chengdu, Putuo, and other police district Baojia systems in the Public Concession are continuing to issue citizen certificates. At the same time, the dates for submitting application forms have also been stipulated and must not be delayed. At the same time, the residency identity cards in the French Concession have also begun to be issued. It is hoped that citizen certificates in the two concessions will be completely issued in August, but it is necessary to hurry up.

### Yesterday, the Heat Wave Did Not Subside - The Temperature Rose to 95.9 Degrees - The Air Pressure Is Stable and the High Heat Will Linger

This port has been hit by a heat wave for several days, and it is extremely hot. Yesterday, the intense heat did not subside. The highest temperature was 95.9 degrees Fahrenheit (35.5 degrees Celsius). The city was steaming hot, and the whole city was like boiling water. Because the wind was very weak, the heat was even worse, and the air pressure was extremely stable, so the intense heat is still difficult to dispel.

### Special Permits for Returning Home Require Submission of Epidemic Prevention Certificates

The Bureau of Works Special Home Return Certificate continues to be issued, but the issuing time has been changed to 12:00 noon. The number of people applying to the Bureau of Works issuing office continues to be high. However, residents applying for certificates to return home must bring their epidemic prevention certificates for verification before they can be issued.

### Emergency Measures to Control Prices - First Stipulate the Maximum Price of Yarn and Cloth - A Special Committee Will Be Established in the Near Future

Allied News Agency, This Port Dispatch: It was learned yesterday that strict price controls are being brewed here. Regarding this matter, after thorough discussions between the Asia Development Board and various representative groups, the basic policy is now being decided. In order to implement strict price controls, it is necessary to establish smooth liaison between various agencies here. Therefore, it is expected that the Asia Development Board, the Japanese Army and Navy authorities, the Japanese Consulate General, the Bureau of Works, and the Shanghai Special Municipal Government will soon send representatives to form a special committee. It is reported that the authorities, in addition to expanding the agencies responsible for controlling prices, are now planning to take emergency measures. It is reported that the first emergency measure is to stipulate the maximum prices for important commodities such as cotton yarn and cloth, and to more strictly control speculative transactions, so as to effectively control prices. It is necessary to expand the control rights over purchasing, manufacturing, and associations, so the authorities are now paying close attention to this matter. Regarding this point, the general public believes that the authorities will take swift action, but it is expected that the establishment of control rights will still take some time.

### Love Affair Leads to Murder

Li Suying, a woman aged 19, lived in the pavilion room on the third floor of No. 39, Lane Maggie, Maggie Road, French Concession. Because her feelings with her boyfriend, A, were very deep, like a couple, a relationship had already occurred. Unexpectedly, she was obstructed by her mother, who did not allow her to marry him. The woman was depressed and suddenly had a suicidal thought. At about 10:00 p.m. the night before, she secretly ingested poisonous water and committed suicide. She lingered until about 2:00 a.m. the next morning, when her life ended.

### Water Levels Rise in the Lower Reaches of the Yangtze River

Jianghai Customs News: The water levels in the Hankou, Jiujiang, Wuhu, and other sections of the lower reaches of the Yangtze River have increased considerably in recent days. Navigation at night is dangerous in the waterways of Madang, Jiaoshan, etc. The water level outside the Wusong Estuary has also been affected, and the water level at the time of the high tide of the Huangpu River is almost level with the embankment.

### Postman Transporting Drugs Given Probation - Police File Appeal

Drug trafficker Qin Guolian has been trafficking drugs and opium to other ports in this city for profit. He usually sets up agencies in major hotels, taking advantage of the postman's convenience of the job to transport drugs. Last month, Qin entrusted Mao Guoquan (age 27), a Suzhou native who was working as a No. 23 postman at the Zhoupu Post Office, to store 615 grams of morphine (worth ten thousand gold) in the mailbag, intending to cross the Huangpu River by punt. Unexpectedly, he was seized by detectives from the French Concession Police. According to his confession, the main offender Qin Guosu was not arrested, so Mao was sent for investigation. As a result, he was sentenced to one year and six months of imprisonment, with a two-year suspended sentence, and allowed to be released on bail. It is now learned that the French Concession Police expressed dissatisfaction with Mao's sentence being too light and filed an appeal. He has been interrogated three times pending review.

### Bureau of Works Police Department Reorganized Yesterday - 74 British and American Police Officers Dismissed - Japanese Police Officers Appointed to Preside Over Various Police Stations

The English-language "Greater Shanghai Evening Post" reported that Watanabe, the chief of the Bureau of Works Police Department, told reporters yesterday morning that the Bureau of Works Board of Directors had approved the changes in personnel in the Police Department at a meeting on Wednesday, dismissing 74 British and American police officers and appointing Japanese police officers to head various police stations in the Public Concession.

Dismissed Police Officers to Receive Gratuity

The purpose of implementing this reorganization is to comply with the current situation and ensure smoother and closer cooperation between the Police Department and Japanese military, civilian, and government officials. The Police Department will pay gratuities to the dismissed police officers in accordance with regulations. Those who have not served long enough to be eligible for gratuities will receive at least six months' salary. He will also do his best to repatriate all the dismissed police officers to their home countries, because if these people stay in Shanghai, they will inevitably face financial difficulties.

Police Department Remains an International Organization

Furthermore, the purpose of this personnel change is not to oppose the entire British and American community. Any British and American nationals who are willing to cooperate with the Japanese authorities and have certain technical knowledge will be retained. The organization of the Police Department is still international in nature. The number of foreign personnel employed, including the Japanese, is 380, of which 180 are British and American. Now the Police Department will not recruit other police officers to succeed the 74 dismissed, because the number of people is surplus after the foreign police officers were recalled from the Shanghai West Special Police Team. Even if 74 people are dismissed, the number of people is still considered surplus.

Remaining Police Officers Transferred

Since the outbreak of the Pacific War, it has been necessary to reorganize the Police Department. This personnel change was initiated by the Japanese Consul General, who urged the Bureau of Works to reorganize the Police Department. Therefore, he formulated a plan to give Japanese police officers important positions. This plan was approved by the Bureau of Works Board of Directors on Wednesday. Many senior British and American police officers will be retained, but their positions have been changed. For example, Assistant Director Colepan will be responsible for the Foreign Affairs Section. Several other British and American captains will also continue to serve. It is learned that the 74 police officers who left the Police Department were Deputy Director Pike, Assistant Directors Mann and Duncan, Section Chief Ayers, five superintendents, seven detectives, twenty-four captains, twenty-two deputy captains, eighteen sergeants, and one assistant secretary.

Japanese Police Officers to Go to Various Police Stations

Also, the Japanese police officers appointed to various police stations from yesterday are as follows: Ninomiya, Old Gate Police Station; Okawa, Central Police Station; Yasuda, Huishan Police Station; Sugisaka, Jing'an Temple Police Station; Shimizu, New Gate Police Station; Segawa, Gordon Police Station; Sasaki, Huisi Police Station; Kumagai, Hongkou Police Station; Nakabara, Yulin Police Station; Obata, Yangshupu Police Station; Imura, Disui Police Station; Tsuda, Putuo Police Station; Saito, Jiaxing Police Station.

### Collaboration on Fan Paintings by Ershi

Ershi refers to Zhu Qishi and Shi Zhenghong. Zhu's landscapes and seal carving have long been valued by the world. Because of excessive backlog, he has stopped accepting items. Those who obtain a scrap of paper or a small piece of silk treasure it. Now, at the invitation of Shi Zhenghong of Yun, he collaborated on fan paintings as the mood took him, but only limited to painting plum blossoms. Each page only takes 30 yuan for ink costs. Zhu's paintings of eyebrows have a unique style, washing away all the lead and powder. Those who know it regard it as a must-pass work. Shi's calligraphy is based on the Jin and Tang dynasties, and he does not easily put pen to paper on weekdays. This collaboration can be said to complement each other. Collection address: Baochang Office, China Underwear Company, No. 562 Nanjing Road; Shenbao Distribution Office.

### Promotion of Police Detectives in the French Concession

The French Concession Police recently announced a large number of promotions and awards for police officers. It is reported that the awards for the Interview Section and the Criminal Section were recorded in yesterday's newspaper. It is now learned that Zhou Rongchang, a detective in the Political Affairs Department, has been promoted to inspector, and detectives Liu Desen, Hua Zhenting, and Yang Peilu have all been promoted one rank.

### Post Office Headquarters Robbery Case Mastermind, Monk Wukong, Hanged; Accomplices Wang Shulou and Feng Xinzhong Executed Simultaneously; Monk's Concubine Reveals Truth Leading to Case Breakthrough

Convicted criminals sentenced to death, execution delayed due to wartime circumstances, are now being executed sequentially according to orders. Several death row inmates have already been hanged. Yesterday, four more death row inmates were executed by order. Their names and crimes are listed below:

Ji Rentang, from Funing, Jiangbei, is currently 44 years old. He is a monk with the religious name Wukong. On September 9, 1935, at 9:40 AM, he and his gang committed armed robbery at the Beisichuan Road Post Office Headquarters, stealing 91,917 yuan. They shot and killed bodyguards Yuan Bingshu and Lü Ruilin, and wounded Zhou Yusheng. After being arrested, he was initially sentenced to life imprisonment in the first trial. Ji appealed and was eventually sentenced to death.

Wang Shulou, from Jiangbei, is 39 years old. He also goes by Wang Shupei, Chen Yuren, Huang Xianzi, and Chen Bu Gao. His crime is the same as Wukong's.

Feng Xinzhong, from Hunan, is currently 34 years old. On February 18, 1938, at 6:00 AM, he and his gang robbed the home of Du Guangxi at 235 Binlang Road, killing Du and his uncle, Yao Chunlin. He was arrested after the incident and sentenced to death.

Ding Fulin, on August 22, 1937, at 5:00 AM, at 65, Lane 84, North Fujian Road, killed Yang Gensheng, Zhang Binggen, and Wang Peixin with an axe, stealing 190 yuan in cash. He was arrested and sentenced to death. Yesterday morning, the Special Court reviewed the cases of all the criminals, but Ding Fulin had already died in prison on March 29, 1939, so he could not be executed. The three criminals were asked if they had any last words or letters to send to their families. All three stated that they had no last words and did not need to notify their families. They were then sent to the South City execution ground to be hanged.

Concubine Arrested, Reveals the Truth

After the Wukong monk case, six women were captured at the Bund. These women were planning to return to their hometown by ship. After interrogation by the police, it was learned that they were all concubines of the robbers. Among them was Huang Qin, who was the monk's concubine. Through their revelations, the monk's address was discovered. Soon after, the monk was arrested. No stolen money was found in his residence. However, he confessed that he had deposited 1,000 yuan in a local bank, given 3,000 yuan to his concubine, and entrusted another 3,000 yuan to his concubine to be distributed to relatives in his hometown. The remaining money was divided among the gang members. Although successive lawsuits proved that he did not kill the post office employee, he was ultimately sentenced to death in 1936. Therefore, seven years later, he was finally taken to the South City execution ground to be hanged.

### Wanshoushan Restaurant to Open

The Wanshoushan Restaurant Co., Ltd. at 20 Qiaqing Road has been under construction since last autumn, for half a year. The interior decoration, such as the auditorium equipment and room arrangements, are extremely luxurious. The managers of the restaurant, such as General Manager Luo Jingwei and Chairman Qian Zhuping, are all business tycoons and veterans of the restaurant industry. Therefore, they are able to plan grandly and create a miracle in the modern restaurant industry. It is said that the entire project will be completed by the end of the month. The chefs have been recruited from various places, with many talented individuals. The various dishes selected are famous dishes from Cantonese, Sichuan, Beijing, and Jiangsu cuisines, all merged into one, eliminating the unnecessary and preserving the essence, striving to suit the tastes of people from all walks of life, and enhancing the perfect enjoyment. The opening date of the restaurant will not be far away.

### Hongshen Weaving Factory Increases Capital to Expand Business

The Chinese Hongshen Weaving Factory on Maigen Road was established in 1927, specializing in the production of various styles of men's and women's socks, shirts, and silk belts, which have been popular for a long time. Now, in order to expand production, it has increased its original capital by 1.5 million yuan in national currency, which has all been fully paid up. In addition to Lu Yangchun and Gu Baolian, other industry giants such as Xu Guanqun and Sun Ruihuan have also joined the board of directors. Future business will be even more prosperous.

### Poor Children's School Relief Center Notice

The Poor Children's School Relief Center runs two free middle schools and twenty-four free primary schools, all without tuition fees. Enrollment is currently underway. Those who wish to study there can register at the center at Room 619, 8th Floor, Securities Building, 9 Jiujiang Road. Also, the First Free Middle School, formerly located in Fukang Lane, Haining Road, is now experiencing housing problems and is willing to pay a reasonable rent to lease classrooms from nearby schools in the area.

### Cholera Spreads, Emergency Prevention and Control Underway, Area Near Epidemic Zone Sealed Off and Disinfected

Since the discovery of cholera in this city, the epidemic has spread rapidly. The authorities of the two settlements are paying great attention and have already begun the second round of preventive injections. The details are recorded below by a reporter from this newspaper:

The Degree of Prevalence is Quite Severe

The most severe cholera outbreak in this city occurred in 1932. Although there have been cases every year since then, they have been sporadic and not serious. Therefore, given the rapid spread of the recent epidemic, this year appears to be one of the most serious years since 1932.

Among the patients treated at the Shanghai Epidemic Hospital, in addition to the 77 patients already confirmed by the Municipal Council's laboratory to have cholera, the hospital has been ordered to send patients' stool samples to the laboratory for testing. Other hospitals have also been ordered to send patients' stool samples for testing.

Prevention and Control Work is Actively Underway

In terms of prevention and control, the authorities of the two settlements have sent health personnel to thoroughly disinfect the residences of the patients. During the disinfection period, the nearby areas are temporarily sealed off until the disinfection is completed, at which point the seal is lifted. In addition, all residents within the settlements must undergo a second round of preventive injections to ensure safety.

People Leaving Shanghai Must Have Certificates

Since the outbreak of cholera in this city, ships sailing from Shanghai to other ports must be subject to quarantine restrictions by the local customs. Passengers are not allowed to disembark unless they have been inspected and carry a certificate of immunization from the Shanghai health authorities. They will be returned to Shanghai by the ship. Therefore, people going to other ports from Shanghai should pay attention and quickly get immunized to avoid fruitless trips.

### Boiled Water Must Be Boiled Before Sale, Public Notice

The second round of immunization campaign began the day before yesterday. All city residents can go directly to the locations designated by the Municipal Council Health Department to get vaccinated. It is learned that the local boiled water shop trade association, because the outside world has many opinions on the association's boiled water, yesterday issued an emergency notice to inform all members of the trade, urging them to sell boiled water that must be boiled, to respect hygiene, and to prevent the continued spread of the epidemic. The notice is recorded as follows: "Respectfully, recently there have been very serious epidemics in the city, as recorded in various newspapers. Regarding our trade association's boiled water shops, 'there are bound to be sales of water that is not boiled, or mixed with well water, etc.,' which is very alarming. In order to respect business ethics and seek the peace and quiet of the entire society, all members, etc., selling water, should abide by the trade association's trade regulations and sell completely boiled water, so as not to harm the health of the city's residents. If there is any sale of water that is not boiled, once discovered, we will apply to the competent authorities to revoke the business license and publicly discuss severe punishment, which will not be tolerated. This matter concerns vital interests, so please do not tread the path of illegality. Also, the tea urns set up by each member must be completely filled with hot water. Our association has repeatedly pleaded with the relevant authorities for fair-price coal, requesting practical relief, and hoping that all members of the trade can endure hardship and patience, so as to facilitate progress. This is an emergency notice."

### Receipt of the Second Batch of Rice Purchase Certificates Still Requires Housing Tax Receipts; Changes in the Allocation of Broken Rice for Next Week

The Municipal Council's Information Office issued another public notice regarding the distribution of the second batch of rice purchase certificates, saying that the Council's various rice purchase certificate distribution offices will begin distributing the second batch of rice purchase certificates starting on Monday, the 20th of this month. These rice purchase certificates are still divided into four coupons, according to the per capita grain distribution plan, which can be used to purchase rice during the fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth weeks. The distribution procedure is the same as last time.

Date Already Noted on the Back of the Tax Bill

The Council believes that citizens and Council staff have gained considerable experience in the previous rice certificate distribution and expect that the issuance of the second batch of rice purchase certificates will be even smoother. All taxpayers are now aware of the location of the rice purchase certificate distribution office in their district, and the date of this certificate receipt has been noted on the back of their summer housing tax receipt, so there should be no confusion regarding the receipt of rice certificates. The issuance of rice purchase certificates will still be based on the summer housing tax receipt, so taxpayers should bring the receipt with them when receiving the certificate for verification. If taxpayers or residents cannot present their summer housing tax receipt, or have any doubts about the receipt date, they should go to their district's rice purchase certificate distribution office between 3:00 PM and 4:00 PM every day to inquire about everything. Also, the office hours of each office are from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM and 1:00 PM to 4:00 PM every day, and closed on Sundays. The distribution of food is important, so all citizens should pay attention.

Method of Grain and Flour Allocation for the Next Term

After the rice shops receive the purchase orders in order and pay for them, they can extract the quota rice from the Taikoo Zhejiang Xingye two warehouses. The total amount was fully issued yesterday, totaling 7,000 bags of white rice, 13,065 bags of broken rice, and 46,035 bags of flour for the Public Concession rice shops. The amount extracted by the French Concession rice shops was 3,345 bags of white rice, 5,940 bags of broken rice, and 46,035 bags of flour. The total amount for the two concessions was 10,315 bags of white rice, 19,005 bags of broken rice, and 69,095 bags of flour. After the extraction is completed, it will be sold on the 20th. Each rice ticket is for 1 liter of broken rice and 0.5 liters of white rice, sold for 3.8 yuan in savings currency, plus 1.5 jin of flour, sold for 3.7 yuan in savings currency, for a total of 7.5 yuan.

The Second Coupon is the Last Day Today

The 659 rice shops in the two concessions have started distributing quota grain in accordance with the authorities' rationing plan since the 13th of this month. Today, Saturday, is the last day. Those who hold the second coupon of the rice purchase certificate can still purchase from the designated rice shop before 6:00 PM today. Expired certificates will be declared invalid. Taxpayers holding the coupons should pay attention.

### Government Bonds Hover, Highs and Lows Seen

Yesterday, the over-the-counter market for government bonds tended to hover. On one side, the bulls emerged, and on the other side, there was some short covering and some buying. Market prices fluctuated uncertainly, rising and falling within a range of three to five cents. For example, Qianyi, Lianhe, Xinfeng, Tongkang, and other firms saw the bulls slowly emerge, causing the market price to fall. Tonghe, Xinji, Runde, Hongda, and others bought, and the price recovered slightly. Buyers were unwilling to raise prices, and sellers were unwilling to lower prices, so the market hovered within a very small range. Strong players were unwilling to sell, and new bulls had little interest. As a result, market prices saw both highs and lows, rising or falling by only one or two cents. Transactions totaled approximately 1.2 to 1.3 million yuan. A brief table is listed below:

### Chinese Stocks Vary Unevenly

Yesterday, the market for Chinese merchant stocks initially fell and then rose, with the final result being mixed. This was because the previous day's decline had been too sharp, and bargain hunters became active again. Department stores were firm, the new pharmaceutical sector eventually broke even, cultural stocks were stable, and Zhabei Water and Electricity continued to fall. Chinese electrical prices have stabilized, and confidence among all parties has shifted from weak to firm. The prices of various stocks are now recorded as follows:

### Ornamental Gold Exchange Rate Remains High

Yesterday, the asking price for ornamental gold per tael at the Da Xin Tong Hang jewelry stores in this city remained unchanged at 2,200 yuan. At 12:30 PM, it rose by 100 yuan to 2,300 yuan (collecting less about 300 yuan). The inter-dealer price was from 1,950 yuan per tael to as low as 1,910 yuan, and then recovered to 2,050 yuan. In the afternoon, it fell back to 1,990 yuan, a slight increase of 40 yuan, with a difference of 140 yuan. Transactions were very small. The asking price for ornamental silver per tael remained flat at 16 yuan, with the inter-dealer price at 11 yuan 56 cents.

### Cotton Cloth Dispersed Stockpiles, Eager to Sell

Yesterday's market for factory cloth initially fell and then recovered, but still did not escape the sluggish atmosphere. This was because dispersed stock holders were eager to sell, and industry insiders also took advantage of the sluggish sales to unload at high prices, causing the market price to shrink. Peach Blossom Lady Lin Factory single morning opened at 258 yuan 25 cents, plummeted to 251 yuan. Later, due to the rise in Dongpi cloth, short covering arose, pulling the price up to 257 yuan. The afternoon market opened at 256 yuan, then fell to 253 yuan 75 cents, and then recovered to 255 yuan 25 cents, continuing the previous day's decline of 6 yuan per bolt. Other 16-pound earth brand coarse cloth was 167 yuan, Flying Goose was 165 yuan, 9-pound New Character was 109 yuan, and 8-pound Zhenzhong was 107 yuan, each also falling by one or two yuan. Fine cloth such as Fugui and Dapeng had few transactions. Only 12-pound Earth brand fine cloth opened at 157 yuan 50 cents in the morning and rose to 159 yuan 50 cents in the afternoon, an increase of 1 yuan. Trade in bleached cloth and poplin was also rare, with Mulan bleached cloth at 164 yuan and Changshou poplin at 5 yuan 75 cents, both of which were also weak.

Dongpi cloth fluctuated greatly yesterday, and the decline has not yet ended, because rumors continue, causing people to panic. The new single for 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth opened in the morning at 174 yuan, with the smallest bid at 167 yuan, and recovered to 179 yuan 90 cents. At noon, it fell back to 175 yuan 50 cents, a decrease of 2 yuan per bolt. The spirit of Si Junqian Bi Ji was strong, starting from 6 yuan 80 cents, plummeting to 6 yuan 58 cents, and then rising to 6 yuan 87-88 cents due to short covering. Finally, due to the continuous emergence of dispersed stockpiles, the noon closing price was 6 yuan 76 cents, continuing the previous day's decline of 14 cents per foot.

### Military Note Discount Rate Unchanged

Yesterday's military note market remained at 5 yuan 56 cents for inter-dealer trading, with retail asking prices at 5 yuan 55 cents and 57 cents.

Yesterday's interbank lending rate of the Money Trade Association was 11 cents, and the new exchange rate was still flat for cash transactions.

### Limited Woolen Cloth Business

The woolen cloth business has been extremely limited recently. There have been some inquiries for waxed thread, linen cloth, and rainproof materials, but otherwise retail is quiet. The public tea house is also very quiet, because industry insiders have adopted the principle of no import or export, temporarily suspending purchases. Daily sales at door shops have not increased despite the price reduction. This is probably due to the hot weather and the weak purchasing power of the people. Currently, woolen fabrics have become clothing materials that only the propertied class can afford. Ordinary salaried people, even if the price is reduced by several yuan per foot, cannot afford to buy them. An ordinary woolen robe now costs at least 500 yuan in central reserve currency, and a suit costs at least 1,000 yuan or more. Before the authorities stabilize prices, they cannot afford this amount.

Bean products had very few transactions yesterday, and the market was firm and flat. Tianjin tea beans, second grade, opened at 30 bags, priced at 210 yuan. Chongming silkworm sand, 10 bags, was priced at 111 yuan.

### Bean Cake and Wheat Bran Had Few Transactions, Slight Fluctuations

Bean cake's market in the morning was dull with a tendency to be weak, but later turned firm because of the slight recovery in domestic sales. Lizi brand cake, 1,000 pieces of new May cargo, price was 67 to 67.5 yuan. Shenji brand cake, 1,000 pieces of April cargo from the Yoshita warehouse, price was 67.5 to 68.5 yuan. Also, 1,000 pieces of June cargo from the Wangu warehouse, price was 64.75 to 65 yuan. Qingzhong brand cake, 500 pieces, price was 65 yuan.

Wheat bran's market was balanced in terms of supply and demand yesterday, with little fluctuation. 150 bags of Sanxin small-package wheat bran, warehouse receipt from May 26th, price was 96 yuan.

### Medicine and Patent Medicines such as Mentholatum - Domestic Sales are Stagnant

Summer medicines have been sluggish recently. During the currency reform period, all parties spared no effort to collect and stockpile them, hoping to sell them at the right time. However, the prices are too high. In the current context of high living costs, ordinary people can hardly afford them. Their sales rely entirely on Hangyong merchants, who sell them in the interior, but recently their presence has been rare. Therefore, prices continue to fall. Tiger brand headache powder is 20.05 yuan per dozen, Mentholatum is 22 yuan, Bagua Dan is 18.5 yuan, while Bai Fu Oil is relatively firm at 16 yuan per dozen and sells well. Partridge vegetables are 58 yuan, Longhu Rendan is 17 yuan, and Invincible tooth powder is 10 yuan, priced per box.

### Summer Laundry Needs Soap, Soap Prices Increase, Cigarette Prices Slightly Weaken

The cigarette market remains depressed, and there are rumors that ticket issuance will be extended. People are increasingly unsettled. The industry is proceeding cautiously. Small dispersed households are eager to sell, while large households are still waiting and watching. Yesterday, Great Britain brand opened at 8,400 yuan, Old Knife brand at 5,300 yuan, Five Flowers brand at 3,450 yuan, and Fairy brand at 3,550 yuan, continuing the previous day's decline of 100 to 200 yuan. Pin brand was stable at 4,600 yuan. Japanese cigarettes followed the softening trend, with Golden Gun at 1,320 to 1,330 yuan, Golden Building brand at 1,900 yuan, Red Rose brand at 950 yuan, Quanlu brand at 1,600 yuan, and Compass brand at 1,150 yuan. Domestic cigarettes, such as Golden Mouse brand at 1,500 yuan, Beauty brand at 2,700 yuan, and Pyramid brand at 3,000 yuan, saw mixed results.

Daily necessities such as soap were firm in price, as all parties were collecting them. The seller's price increased slightly by about 5 yuan compared to the previous day. Baixiangmao soap was 250 yuan, Huangxiangmao soap was 215 yuan, Guben soap was 340 yuan, and Arrow Knife soap was 265 yuan. Matches remained flat, with Phoenix brand at 3,200 yuan, Beauty brand at 3,300 yuan, Golden Cauldron brand at 2,850 yuan, and miscellaneous brands at 2,350 yuan. White Li's foreign candles were 125 yuan, Monk Hat brand was 120 yuan, and miscellaneous brands were 95 yuan.

### Authentic Shaoxing Wine is About to Run Out, Disappointing Those Who Live for Wine

Shaoxing wine, commonly known as Jingzhuang, has been trending up in price recently. General workshops in the Shaoxing production area have not manufactured wine for five years, as the glutinous rice needed is mostly sourced from Yixing and Danyang. It is no longer like the old days. Local restrictions prohibit the export of grain, and transportation is also obstructed, so it cannot be produced. Therefore, most winemaking workers are concentrated in Suzhou to continue production and distribution to various places, hence the name "Suzhou wine." Hotels in this city uniformly use it for retail sales, mostly mixed with 30% Shaoxing wine and 70% Suzhou wine to suit tastes. Recently, rice prices have risen in the production area, with a 50-jin bag now costing 70 to 80 yuan. The price of pure Shaoxing wine has risen to 200 yuan, and there are few sellers because inventories are dwindling, the production area is naturally disappearing, and there is a risk of stockouts in the future. Followers of Liu Bi are disappointed to hear this.

### Increased Transactions in Raw Sugar Shares, Price Still Downward... Result: Little Four Yuan

Yesterday, the trend of the sugar shares listed on the Sugar Merchants' Cooperative Business Office was still soft, and the North Gang intended to sell, so the price was weaker. Raw sugar shares fell by 2 yuan at the opening to 310 yuan, and then fell to a low of 307 yuan, and then fell even lower to 305 yuan. Afterwards, buyers increased, so it recovered to 308 yuan at the close, down 4 yuan from before. A total of 1,800 bags were transacted. Red sugar shares were called out at 5 yuan less, at 295 yuan, but no transaction occurred.

### Trial of New Xuzhou Vegetables at a Small Scale – Price Opens at Five Hundred Yuan

New Xuzhou vegetables have been appearing on the market for many days. Recently, some merchants brought small quantities, totaling a few hundred catties, to be sold on consignment at Zhenbang stores, hoping to test the market. The vegetables were of good color and texture, but slightly soft. The Mao Ji trading company acquired them for five hundred yuan. The quantity was small, so it cannot be considered a true market price.

Visiting Women on Stage

### Ding Zhi's Temperament

— Lan Ying

In "The Second Dream," Ding Zhi plays Ms. Feng Wei, who fears nothing. In reality, Ding Zhi is a timid person. Even now, she is still afraid to ride a bicycle on the road.

Speaking of Ding Zhi, six years ago she specialized in dramatic arts at the Nanjing Drama School. According to her, she spent two years at the school exclusively studying theoretical books. Therefore, we can imagine that Ding Zhi has a considerable understanding of drama. She performed in plays such as "Shanghai Nights" and "Wu Zetian" at the Shanghai Drama Society. Later, she joined the Shanghai Professional Troupe. Now she is a core member of the Shanghai Art Troupe. The Shanghai Art Troupe treats her well, but unfortunately, she doesn't have good interpersonal relationships. Coupled with her naturally aloof temperament, few members of the troupe get along with her. However, she has recently realized that "an aloof temperament is an obstacle to a happy life" and is making appropriate efforts to control it. She is, after all, intelligent.

Among Hollywood stars, she most admires Marlene Dietrich, saying that Marlene's acting style suits her taste perfectly. However, she doesn't aspire to the kind of success that Marlene has. She says, "If I have the chance to read some books, I want to become a playwright in the future."

### The Legend of Deanna Durbin's Death

— Ge Zhiqing

Von Paul Also Commits Suicide!

On the unlucky thirteenth, a shocking message was broadcast by a radio station in San Francisco: Deanna Durbin died in childbirth, and her husband, Von Paul, also committed suicide!

Before confirmed news arrives in Shanghai, may God bless this talented couple. Now, let me introduce Durbin's history:

She was born in Winnipeg, Canada, on December 4, 1922. Her original name was Anna May Durbin. She entered Hollywood at the age of fifteen and changed her name to Deanna Durbin.

Her debut film was "Three Smart Girls," followed by "One Hundred Men and a Girl," "Mad About Music," "Three Smart Girls Grow Up," "First Love," "Spring Parade," "It Started with Eve," etc., all of which were screened in Shanghai.

This spring, she co-starred with Charles Laughton in a new film titled "Almost An Angel." In the current circumstances, Shanghai audiences will not have the opportunity to see it.

After being in Hollywood for four or five years, she never picked up bad habits: she didn't like heavy makeup, didn't like wearing high heels, and her footprints couldn't be found in nightclubs. Her daily way of relaxing was to hug her puppy at home, read novels. She has read "Gone with the Wind" three times. Her reading speed is truly amazing! Although she loves to read, she is not good at schoolwork. If you ask her to do an arithmetic problem, she gets a headache from fear!

Her lunch and dinner are very simple, usually consisting of sandwiches, cold dishes, and milk. She loves to eat ice cream cake and noodles, but dislikes vegetables the most.

Every morning she practices singing with her French teacher for half an hour, which is why she has that round, lustrous golden voice that people long for! She learns classical music, not jazz, and certainly not Hawaiian tropical love songs. She doesn't like to sing those kinds of songs.

She and Von Paul had several years of friendship and married on May 7 last year. After the wedding, they took a motorboat to Del Monte for an economical honeymoon, playing golf for a week. The expenses didn't exceed one hundred yuan.

The couple was exceptionally loving and lived a happy life, with no quarrels ever seen. The news of this unfortunate event may just be a rumor!

### Double Image of Deanna Durbin and Von Paul

(Editor's Note) The rumor that Deanna Durbin and Von Paul are committing suicide together is rampant. However, with the current communication isolation, it is difficult to confirm. If this is true, then Havas would have an official message. Why is there no news? May the Durbin couple be fortunate enough to remain healthy and continue to do their best for the film industry in the future. This saying is recorded provisionally, and readers should read it provisionally as well.

By chance, I met two new singers at the Paramount, Lan Ling and Zheng Xia. Initially, I thought female singers must be very romantic. However, after talking with them, my prejudice was completely overturned. Not only are they articulate and generous, charming and adorable, but they also treat people with courtesy and respect, without the habits of ordinary female singers of the time. This is very rare!

### Paramount Singers

— Zhi Xing

Lan Ling's surname is Zhang. Lan Ling is her stage name. According to her, she studied at Qia Zhong Girls' School before. Her father was a painter and died early. She and her younger brother rely on their mother to raise them. She loves painting and singing. Because of poor family circumstances, she couldn't continue her studies, so she joined the Paramount as a backing singer a week ago, along with Zheng Xia.

Zheng Xia has a longer history of singing. She was originally with Yangtze. She has a beautiful voice and is highly praised by the audience, a talented person in the music world!

I heard them sing "Sailing in the Sea of People" and "Full Garden of Spring Colors" together. Their singing voices are round, melodious, and pleasant. I hope they will have more opportunities to come into contact with Western classical music and not be influenced by the current trends. If they work hard and strive to improve, I believe they will have a bright future!

### Lang Deshan Returns in Force

Mr. Lang Deshan, a Chinese artist who has traveled the world and enjoys a long-standing reputation, has been performing in Shanghai since 1932, exactly ten years ago. The people of Shanghai have been longing to see Mr. Lang's talent and superb skills for almost their entire lives. It is recently learned that Mr. Lang has accepted the invitation of friends in Shanghai and will soon perform his latest great program with the technical artists Pan Yuzhen and Yu Lan at the Great Light Theater. At the same time, the popular New Kaleidoscope Troupe will also join the performance. Such a grand collaboration is unprecedented in the art world. It is predicted that the day of the performance will be a sensation.

### China's First Female Sound Engineer

Sun Jing's "Martyrdom" has begun working at the Third Factory. The recording work is being carried out by a female employee. In domestic films, most of the female employees participating in the production work are in the film processing room and as script supervisors. This sound engineer is the first to participate in technical work. Speaking of this person, she is indeed very famous, she is Ms. Cheng Bofang, the widow of the late sound engineer Gu Zongyi. In the past, they worked together as husband and wife, jointly researching sound recording. The "dog tooth" sound recording method used by Cheng Bofang in "Martyrdom" was created by the couple together. She not only carries out the work but also has technical inventions, so that Hollywood's only female director, Dorothy Arzner, cannot claim to be the only one in the field!

### Sharing the Same Boat Through Storms

— He Jia Zhi

(7) Thunder and Lightning

His grandfather had a diary that he kept intermittently for twelve or thirteen years, but unfortunately, Wei Cheng was born too late to be written about in his grandfather's diary. However, there were very detailed records of his father and uncle's wedding ceremonies. He read the diary for more than a month. By the time he had sorted out his grandfather's handwriting, it was late autumn and early winter. Second Mrs. Ye saw that he was still in good health, so she couldn't bear to interrupt his excitement, and only asked, "Wei Cheng, when you go out, your father is gone, but you have been busy for so many days, you should know what kind of person your father was who cherished his reputation." Wei Cheng said: "Yes, grandfather liked to buy books, liked to grow flowers, and liked to help the poor. I have seen all of this in his diary and collection of writings. If I had such a grandfather alive, our happiness, I don't know how it would be? Ah! Now..." Second Mrs. Ye saw that he was a little sad and laughed, "It's triggering your sadness again. Don't be like this. Next year you should still go to school, go to Shanghai, don't go to Suzhou again."

Wei Cheng continued to collect the surviving writings of his father and uncle, but they were not as numerous as his grandfather's, and they never wrote a diary. He thought, there were some old books piled in the attic of his mother's room, so he went to look for them. There were several kinds that were incomplete copies at the Shuangmei Bookstore. After piecing them together, they were no longer incomplete copies. And in a bookcase, he found the letters he had sent to his mother in Suzhou. His mother had written the date of receipt on the envelopes. Cui Zhen looked inside from the glass pane of the window. Wei Cheng accidentally looked up and waved his hand, saying, "Sister Cui Zhen, come in." Cui Zhen walked in and smiled: "Brother Cheng, you are so busy every day, we are idle. This year's harvest is not bad. I heard Second Aunt say that she paid back Wei Yunqing's money, but I don't know how much." Wei Cheng said, "Sit down. It's cold, I'm afraid you'll get chilblains again." Cui Zhen said, "It's okay. I'm enjoying myself this year. I haven't had to work day and night." Wei Cheng was just taking a piece of paper out of an old book when he suddenly exclaimed "Ouch," his hand trembled, and his face changed. Cui Zhen was shocked. (131)
