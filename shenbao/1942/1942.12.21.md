### Public Opinion

The power of the people is the power that determines everything.

This is not only the essence of political theory in the new era, but also the highest principle of our Chinese political philosophy for thousands of years. From Mencius's "the people are the most important" and the theory of "heaven sees as the people see," to the advocacy of "people's rights" by the National Father, Mr. Sun Yat-sen, all of these are to awaken the attention of the court and the public to the decisive power of the people. The so-called "kingly way," in its ultimate pursuit, is still "starting anew with the people" in order to "gain the people to prosper." In this era of long-term war, we demand victory in this war. Whether it is the spiritual support, or the material assistance and replenishment, which one is not dependent on the people?

Therefore, we hope that our friendly nation, Japan, will further understand the significant role of Chinese public opinion in politics. The implementation of any policy or law must simultaneously observe the needs and trends of the current largest number of Chinese people, and then seek implementation methods that are appropriate to public opinion in order to achieve ideal results and ensure complete success. For example, in the current issue of people's food, the principles set by the authorities are not imperfect, and they also consider both the Chinese people and Sino-Japanese cooperation. According to theoretical estimates, it will definitely gain the approval and support of all parties. However, from the perspective of the actual situation, we deeply feel that it is still necessary to adapt to the sound methods of the majority of Chinese public opinion. Of course, the food issue is just one example, and other issues are the same. Principles alone are not enough; there must also be methods, and the center of the method is to adapt to the majority of Chinese public opinion.

### Shattering America's Deception - December 15th "Asahi Shimbun" Editorial

The talk of postwar order is perhaps most verbose from the United States. However, whether this so-called postwar order is correct or not is self-evident.

Last year, on October 1st, US Secretary of the Navy Knox advocated that the US and British navies should cooperate to maintain maritime security around the world. This means that the US and Britain want to use force to monitor the world order; they act as the chief of police and use force to suppress those who go against their will. This claim, even within the United States, has provoked opposition from the majority, but they have appointed themselves as the supervisors and police chiefs of world security and order. This attitude has only become more persistent over time.

This American world policy, as the Americans themselves point out: First, it is a kind of ambition that exceeds the strength of the US and Britain; second, this oppressive, condescending attitude, on the contrary, may arouse the resentment of other countries. Regarding the first point, if implemented according to the American method, the US and Britain want to establish a new system that covers the entire world; as a pipe dream? No matter how large this plan is, it is impossible to put it into practice with the power of two or three countries. Furthermore, it is even more outrageous for these two or three countries to force other countries to comply with their own will. It is precisely this wrong method of promoting the establishment of a new order, and their arrogant attitude, that has become the cause of disrupting peace. The outbreak of this Greater East Asia War also stems from this.

Secondly, what exactly is the peace that the United States is trying to achieve? Roosevelt talked about the Four Freedoms—that is, freedom of speech, freedom of religion, freedom from want, and freedom from fear. Peace must be based on justice, which goes without saying. How can they achieve the Four Freedoms when they fundamentally lack this premise? Secretary of State Hull advocated the establishment of coordination on the condition of reciprocal trade. Expelling Orientals from their own country, desperately abusing blacks domestically, and using high tariffs to exclude foreign goods, while engaging in plunder in Central and South America with all their might—what is particularly shameful is that, due to selfishness, they have repeatedly brought international economic conferences to bankruptcy: how can such an America now sing the tune of coordination on the condition of reciprocal trade? Doesn't this seem like the devil chanting Buddhist scriptures?

The new system that the United States is trying to achieve, relying solely on a few empty words from the leaders, I believe will not succeed in the end. Their intentions, just as they are now very concretely and clearly unfolding in the relationship between the Pan-American countries in the Western Hemisphere, are to complete the so-called extreme aggression of pursuing profit only. In the Western Hemisphere, what exactly is the coordination organization that has been promoted in the past and present? That is Roosevelt's Big Stick Diplomacy, Knox's Dollar Diplomacy...etc., an extremely aggressive policy that the countries of Central and South America have already experienced. In short, it is nothing more than imperialism disguised by the mask of democracy. {At present, Roosevelt has written the four characters "Good Neighbor Policy" in large letters on the signboard, but later, his true colors will eventually be revealed. Now, aren't the ABC countries of South America, as well as Mexico in Central America, already attacking the American international coordination organization as a group? In short, judging from the current international organization in the Western Hemisphere, the so-called world policy of the United States is something that makes all related countries, except for the United States, frown; that is, it is the so-called "Roman conquest" where only the United States can be satisfied, and all other countries will suffer.

A year has passed quickly since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War. This war was caused precisely by the United States' attitude of self-righteousness.

However, under the wise strategy and brave battles of the Imperial Army soldiers, and the united efforts of one hundred million people, we are daringly carrying out a solemn punishment against American hegemony. This is not only related to the fate of one corner of Greater East Asia. Even the countries of Central and South America, which are groaning under the American selfish policy of control, will surely easily understand Japan's true intentions and place great expectations on Japan. Here, we hope to thoroughly shatter America's deception. All the one hundred million people of East Asia must understand: the road that Japan is taking at the moment is how close it is to the right path, and how full it is of the light of justice.

Then, in the afternoon of the same day, they will visit Prime Minister Tojo.

Nanjing, 20th (Central News Agency): According to observations from various aspects obtained here, since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the National Government has cooperated with Japan in the spirit of sharing joys and sorrows, in order to complete the great cause of East Asia. Now, as the Greater East Asia War enters its second year, in order to cope with the current situation, it has been decided to further cooperate with Japan. Because if the Sino-Japanese problem is not resolved, then the Greater East Asia War will be difficult to complete. This time, Chairman of the National Government and concurrently President of the Executive Yuan Wang, accompanied by government officials such as Chu Minyi, Zhou Fohai, Mei Shiping, and Lin Baisheng, has once again gone to Japan. Its significance is extremely profound. Sino-Japanese friendly relations will surely become closer from now on. It has been a year and a half since Chairman Wang visited Japan in late June of last year. During this period, when the Greater East Asia War broke out, Chairman Wang immediately issued a statement, stating that the National Government had decided to follow the spirit of the Sino-Japanese Basic Treaty and the Sino-Japanese-Manchukuo Joint Declaration, sharing joys and sorrows with Japan. After that, there was Ambassador Chu's special visit to Japan, and the return visits of the three special envoys of Japan, Hiranuma, Arita, and Nagai. The diplomatic relations between the two countries have already become closer. Previously, on the anniversary of the Greater East Asia War, Chairman Wang also strongly stated that the National Government would further cooperate with Japan. Therefore, it is expected that after Chairman Wang's visit to Japan, the cooperation between China and Japan will surely have a leap forward development.

### General Rommel's Troops Move Towards Nofilia; Reach Favorable Terrain to Buy Time; British Encirclement Plan Has Been Shattered

Lisbon, 20th (Domei News Agency): According to reports received here from the Axis side, General Rommel's troops, after inflicting blows on the British army, have left Sid and are now moving towards Nofilia, having reached favorable terrain to buy time. According to Berlin Radio, the vanguard of the British army, which had taken encirclement action, had reached the coastal avenue and traveled far. Rommel's rearguard, after resting for a long time, rose up to attack and inflicted heavy damage. It seemed that the British infantry was waiting for the tanks to arrive before acting again on this coastal avenue. Berlin solemnly stated that Rommel had shattered the British army's plan to encircle the German army. In Tunisia, there were only small contacts between the two sides, while the Axis air force continued to attack the Allied fortifications.

Berlin, 20th (Haitong News Agency): Regarding the news reported by London Radio that the German-Italian armored vehicle team under Marshal Rommel in North Africa had been cut into sections and that most of the North African army had been surrounded, Berlin sources stated last night that Rommel had shattered the British army's encirclement plan and captured many British prisoners of war. In addition, the captured German soldiers had been freed. Reuters, due to the facts, had to admit that the surrounded Axis army had escaped. Urged by Churchill, General Montgomery made every effort to attack the flanks of the German-Italian army, but was blocked by the Axis army's fierce artillery fire and vast minefields. In addition to heavy losses, the Allied army achieved nothing.

Bern, Switzerland, 19th (Havas News Agency): According to British and German telegrams, there was no change on the Tunisian front yesterday. German sources said that the weather improved slightly yesterday, and German aircraft went out to bomb British and American artillery positions, shooting down 18 British and American aircraft, including two four-engine bombers. According to news from the Allied headquarters in North Africa, there were only local battles on the entire Tunisian front yesterday, but the details have not been announced. In addition, the American side admitted that due to the lack of ships, it is temporarily difficult to fulfill its promise to provide economic aid to French North Africa. Medicines may be transported to North Africa in the coming months, but there are no ships available to transport food.

Tangier, 20th (Haitong News Agency): According to news heard here, a part of the French army in French Morocco that is loyal to General Pétain has joined the Moorish tribes to make armed resistance against the British and American invading forces. In addition, the French reserve army in Morocco refused to join the invaders' camp. Therefore, American propaganda agencies are making every effort to induce the French and natives of Morocco to join the Allied side. The authorities have issued appeals six times, requesting the French reserve army to join the British and American armies.

German Aircraft Attack Benghazi

Rome, 20th (Haitong News Agency): According to the Italian military headquarters, German aircraft attacked Benghazi, destroying two Allied cargo ships, totaling 12,000 tons. Allied aircraft attacked Axis army positions in Libya and Tunisia, losing seven aircraft. Four were shot down by Axis anti-aircraft guns, and three were shot down by Italian aircraft in Sabratha. There were patrol activities on the Sirte front and in the Tunis area. When German aircraft attacked Benghazi, port facilities were also hit. In Tunis, 26 people were killed and 47 injured by enemy aircraft. In the Sousse area, 27 people were killed and 30 injured. German aircraft raided the airfield on Malta at night. A British convoy was attacked southwest of Malta, and one transport ship sank.

### Turkey and the Soviet Union Have Not Conducted Treaty Negotiations; Only Seeking to Remove Tensions; Turkish Ambassador to Germany Returns Home Via Bulgaria

Ankara, 20th (Haitong News Agency): Turkish officials yesterday denied the rumors spread by the UK and the US that Turkey had signed a friendship treaty with the Soviet Union. It is said that since the Soviet defendants in the case of the assassination of the German Ambassador to Turkey von Papen have been questioned, Turkey and the Soviet Union are still trying to remove the tension between the two. It is understood that the Soviet Union, in order to be consistent with the policies of the UK and the US, will soon issue a statement in the south to express its friendship to Turkey.

Ankara, 20th (Haitong News Agency): Officials here announced that Turkish Ambassador to Germany Ali Khan returned to Istanbul by car from Bulgaria on the 17th, and is expected to arrive here tomorrow.

### Japan-Thailand Alliance Anniversary; Tsubogami Delivers Speech

Bangkok, 20th (Central News Agency): The 21st is the anniversary of the establishment of the Japan-Thailand Offensive and Defensive Alliance. Japanese Ambassador to Thailand Tsubogami delivered a speech on the 20th and said that the conclusion of the offensive and defensive alliance between Japan and Thailand was by no means accidental. Looking back on the past relations between the two countries, it can be seen that the authorities of the two countries had long had the determination to cooperate between the two countries. However, due to the obstruction of the UK and the US, they could not make a clear announcement. But the hearts of the two countries were filled with enthusiasm. Once it was made public, there would be rapid progress. Looking back on the past year, the people of Japan and Thailand have fought side by side and shared weal and woe. When the Japanese army attacked Malaya and Burma, the Thai government assumed important responsibilities, such as ensuring the rear supply line and providing operational bases. At the same time, the Thai army also responded to the Japanese army's attack on Burma. In addition to assisting Japan militarily, the Thai government also exported a large amount of grain to solve Japan's food problem. In order to resolve Thailand's currency insecurity, Japan also provided Thailand with a loan of 200 million yen. As a result, Japan and Thailand have achieved practical cooperation in financial relations. In order to seek cultural cooperation and restore the inherent culture of East Asia, the governments of the two countries signed a cultural agreement. All of these facts are sufficient to prove that the relationship between Japan and Thailand has become closer, and cannot be shaken by any false propaganda. Looking back on the past year, the Japanese army has been invincible and has won every battle, and has already secured the key to final victory. At the same time, the UK and the US have been defeated again and again. However, the Japanese people are not satisfied with the victories they have obtained. The goal of Japan's operations is to strive for final victory. It will not stop fighting unless the UK and the US are subdued. Therefore, the war in the past year is only the prelude to the war. Today, the people of Japan and Thailand should be aware and sacrifice everything to strive for final victory. If the people of the two countries can thoroughly realize this, the alliance will surely have a leap forward development, and the final victory can be completed as a result.

### West of Toropets, the Germans Occupied Several Soviet Positions; Soviet Counterattacks Between the Don and Volga Rivers Were Repelled

Responsible parties here have declined to comment on the various rumors circulating about Jordana's visit to Portugal, stating only that Jordana's trip to Lisbon is merely a return visit for Salazar's visit to Spain earlier this spring.

Haitong News Agency Dispatch from Lisbon, December 20th: Portuguese President Carmona hosted a banquet yesterday for Spanish Foreign Minister Jordana, declaring that Jordana is not only a representative of the Spanish government but also a representative of the people.

Consensus May Be Reached on Preventing the Expansion of the Battlefield

Central News Agency Dispatch from Lisbon, December 20th: Spanish Foreign Minister Jordana, accompanied by twelve staff members, arrived here on the afternoon of the 18th and is scheduled to stay until the 21st, holding separate talks with Portuguese President and Prime Minister Salazar. At a time when the North African war is underway and the movements of Spain and Portugal are attracting worldwide attention, the importance of these talks is self-evident. Spanish Foreign Minister Jordana's visit to Portugal is ostensibly a return visit for the Portuguese-Spanish talks in February of this year, but after meeting with the Portuguese President, the Spanish Foreign Minister will thoroughly exchange views with Prime Minister Salazar, discuss jointly maintaining the two countries' neutrality policies, and discuss current urgent issues, and seek to establish a common stance to prevent the expansion of the war. When British and American forces entered North Africa, Spain and Portugal received guarantees from both warring parties to maintain their neutrality and territorial integrity. However, while the situation in North Africa has not yet come to an end, it is also necessary to determine a common countermeasure to prevent any eventuality. However, Spain still insists on maintaining a friendly non-belligerent stance toward the Axis powers, which is in direct contrast to Portugal's fundamental national policy of protecting its African colonies and seeking the understanding of the United Kingdom and the United States. Therefore, the two countries' foreign policies are too subjective and are actually a point of contention. However, on the point of preventing the expansion of the battlefield, the two countries can naturally reach a consensus. It is generally observed that the two countries may take the opportunity of the talks to agree on joint military action by the two countries when necessary.

Haitong News Agency Dispatch from Lisbon, December 20th: According to political circles in Lisbon, the Spanish government decided to send Foreign Minister Jordana to Lisbon for a visit only three weeks ago, which is sufficient to prove that recent developments in North Africa have made Spain have a desire to discuss relevant issues with Portugal. Spain's concern about Spanish Morocco has been exacerbated by the visit of former Spanish Prime Minister Negrín to North Africa, as Negrín has been vigorously advocating for the actions taken by the United Kingdom and the United States in Spain over the past year. The Portuguese side is also very concerned about Negrín's statement, as Portugal has always opposed communist activities. According to the narrow views of political figures in Lisbon, the issues discussed by the Spanish Foreign Minister and Portuguese politicians will be nothing more than the expansion of the North African war, the negotiations between the United States and Negrín, and the intensification of communist propaganda activities on the Iberian Peninsula.

### Waste of Materials: Striving on One Hand, Wasting on the Other; Next Year's Budget Difficult to Draft

The opposite of thrift is waste. If an individual wastes energy, their health will suffer. If they waste money, their finances will be in disarray. If a country wastes materials, its resources will become insufficient. Conversely, if waste is exchanged for thrift, the opposite result will naturally be obtained.

The outcome of modern warfare depends on the sustainability of the rise and fall of material resources on both sides of the conflict. Since the Sino-Japanese Incident, the Chongqing regime's advocacy of "economic warfare," "three parts politics, seven parts economy," and other statements are all conclusions that emphasize materials. Recently, the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Economic Affairs of Chongqing have further sought to acquire materials, formulated the "Wartime Management of Import and Export Goods Regulations," and abolished all previously promulgated restrictions. The standard for imported goods is not "enemy" or "friend"; all military and daily necessities are generally permitted. In addition, the regime has ordered all provinces to implement "material grabbing," distributing US dollar bonds and savings bonds to provinces for promotion, with the proceeds used to grab materials. It can be said that it has exhausted the means of "striving" and "grabbing," and it can also be said that it has fully revealed its predicament.

However, the Chongqing regime's measures are often a flash in the pan, or the law is abandoned by lawmakers, or played by those in power. Speaking of thrift, although there is no explicit legal provision, it is an obligation that everyone should have in this era, especially the public should take precedence over the private. Because private thrift is sometimes driven by the concept of self-interest and is easy to implement, and most people's lives are already on the verge of the hunger line, there is nothing to save. The most important thing to strive for is the public. Public officials do not need to pay for public goods themselves, so they do not know how to cherish or take care of them, and they arbitrarily damage or discard them. Especially when air raids are frequent, they are slightly damaged by tremors, and they are discarded and replenished, which wastes a lot of money. The attitude towards spending money on household and institutional supplies is completely different. For example, the stationery of rear-area civil servants is equivalent to the guns of front-line soldiers. Soldiers are punished for losing their guns, but rear-area civil servants can arbitrarily lose the stationery they use without any responsibility. Although it is a matter of a small amount of ink, a seal mud, or a pen nib, the accumulation of small amounts adds up to a large expense. Someone once said that the loss of stationery by civil servants should be treated the same as the loss of guns by soldiers. In terms of responsibility, it does not seem to be an exaggeration.

When the Soviet Union implemented its five-year plan for national construction, the whole country tightened its belts, endured all the inconveniences of life, in order to establish a solid foundation for the national economy. Germany is a victorious country in Europe, but every German, rich or poor, lives a wartime thrifty life in the country. Beef and white bread are not easy to see. Daily sundries are distributed in fixed quantities. The country's material conditions allow for a certain amount of enjoyment, and you can only get that much. If you want to exceed the prescribed amount, you cannot buy it no matter how much money you have. Looking back at the current environment of the Chongqing regime, the international routes have been blocked one after another, and the source of materials has been suddenly cut off. There are few ways to open up sources, and on the other hand, there are too many redundant institutions, and civil servants, especially the ruling class, indulge in waste without any sense of public morality or responsibility. This means that it is impossible to talk about reducing expenditure. Under such an atmosphere, how can the effect of "striving for" and "grabbing" materials be truly achieved? Even if some are "grabbed" and "strived for," isn't it still the same waste? Since it does not have the conditions for the sustainable rise and fall of material resources, how can it obtain the favorable results of a protracted war?

### Overview of Resource Development in North China, Translated from the December 11, 1942, "Osaka News"

Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the economic progress of the Northeast has been remarkable in all aspects, especially in the development of heavy industry.

Iron Ore: In July 1939, the Mengjiang United Committee and the North China Development Company each contributed half of the capital of 20 million Japanese yen to establish the Longyan Iron and Steel Co., Ltd., which became the center of development. The company's mining areas are located in Yihua, Huailai, and Longguan counties, including Yanshan, Pangjiabao, Zhuolu, and Sanchakou. Initially, the focus was on developing the Yantongshan mining area, with the Pangjiabao mining area as an adjunct. After the completion of the Jingbao Line from Yihua Station to Pangjiabao Railway (i.e., the Pangjia Line), the amount of steel output to Japan from Pangjiabao has gradually increased and surpassed that of Manchuria. The company's specialization has gradually developed. As of April of this year, the capital increased to 60 million Japanese yen, and it is now determined to increase production and seek development. In addition, there is the Shanxi Iron Mining Plant, which is jointly funded by the North China Development Company and the Okura Iron Industry Company, which is also engaged in mining the Dongshan, Yixiang, and Ningwu iron mountains, among which the Yixiang Iron Mountain is the most promising, with estimated reserves of 1.2 million tons, and is currently accelerating mining.

Iron and Steel Industry: There are three iron and steel companies: the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant in Hebei Province, the Taiyuan Iron Factory in Shanxi Province, and the Yangquan Iron Factory. The Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant transports ore from Longyan, while the Taiyuan and Yangquan factories transport ore from Dongshan, Yixiang, and Ningwu, and each produces pig iron and steel materials. In order to improve management and expand production, the Shanxi and Yangquan iron factories were jointly funded in April of this year by thirteen Japanese companies in China centered on the North China Development Company to establish Shanxi Industry Co., Ltd. for management and operation.

Coal: Coal is the largest resource in North China in terms of both quantity and quality. It is currently the center of industrial development in North China. The establishment of transportation and communication agencies, power generation plans, and the distribution of resource funds are all prioritized due to the development of coal mines. The main coal mines are Datong, Jingxing, Zhongxing, Jiaozuo, Liuquan, Shanxi, and Cixian. The Datong coal mine has increased its production by 4 million tons. In January 1940, the Datong Coal Mine Co., Ltd. was jointly funded by the North China Development Company, the South Manchuria Railway Company, and the Mengjiang government to operate and mine the coal mine. The Jingxing coal mine is operated and mined by the Sino-Japanese joint venture Jingxing Coal Mine Company. The company was founded in July 1940 and now also operates the coal mine west of Liuhegou. A powder factory has been established in Shimen to refine coking coal using the coal produced by the mine. The Zhongxing, Jiaozuo, Liuquan, Shanxi, and Cixian coal mines have been jointly operated since November 1940 and are managed by the Japanese military. The capital of each mine is either solely funded by the North China Development Company or jointly funded by the company and other Japanese companies by agreement. Among them, the Zhongxing coal mine has the largest coal output of the coal mines currently managed by the military. Its coal is a sticky coking coal with a calorific value of over 8,000 calories, making it the most suitable for iron making among the coal produced in North China. In addition, Liuquan coal has recently attracted much attention due to its suitability for low-temperature dry distillation, and its production performance is very good, and this year will exceed the planned quantity. In addition, the coal mines in Shandong Province have also been actively developed for a year.

Salt: Regarding salt, there have been several salt production increase plans recently. The development of Changlu Salt and Shandong Salt is now underway. As a result, Japan's dependence on distant sea salt has been transformed into dependence on near-sea salt, and its salt production has become a supply source for Japanese raw materials. In August 1939, the North China Development Company invested 18.75 million Japanese yen, and the North China Political Affairs Commission invested 6.25 million Japanese yen, totaling 25 million Japanese yen in capital, to establish the North China Salt Industry Co., Ltd. to operate and develop salt production and refining. The long-abandoned salt fields and the folk salt fields with extremely immature manual salt-making technology and extremely low production have also been completely renewed since the establishment of the company due to the expansion of salt fields and the improvement of technology. As for Shandong Salt, it was originally monopolized by Shandong Salt Industry Co., Ltd., which was established in February 1937 with a capital of 1 million Japanese yen. In March 1938, Mitsui Bussan Co., Ltd. and Mitsubishi Corporation joined the operation, and the capital increased to 10 million Japanese yen. In June 1941, the North China Development Company transferred 60,000 shares, so the company's operations also came under the North China Development Company, greatly increasing production and strengthening support for Japan.

Other Resources: In addition to the development of the above-mentioned resources such as iron, coal, and salt, the increase in production of agricultural products such as cotton and wheat is also very active. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, Japan's economic base in North China has been used to drive out the forces of the United States and the United Kingdom, and its importance has become increasingly self-evident. On the other hand, North China can no longer remain a mere supplier of raw materials as before. In terms of processed products, it has almost reached the point where most of them no longer need to be supplied by Japan. In other words, North China has recently reached the point where it is becoming increasingly established in its self-sufficiency.

Future Hopes: Since 1942, North China has entered the program of the second five-year plan. The goal of this plan is to establish a raw material refining industry centered on iron, coal, and salt five years later, so that North China will leap from a position as a raw material supply area to an industrial manufacturing area. In addition, in order to increase food production and establish the self-sufficiency of the Hebei economy, water conservancy has been thoroughly improved this year. It is planned that from February of this year to March of next year, a total of 200,000 irrigation canals will be built in various parts of Hebei, including 2,000 in Beijing, 3,000 in Tianjin, 20,000 in Baoding, 60,000 in Shimen, 45,000 in Handan, 35,000 in Shandong, 15,000 in Kaifeng, 15,000 in Shanxi, and 5,000 in other areas. It has been completed in Hebei Province by 90%, Shandong Province by 70%, Shanxi Province by 100%, and Henan Province by 65%, which is a good result. It is expected that it will be completed by the scheduled date of March next year. (Translated by Ding)

### Field Communication: Special Correspondent from Hinode (Sent from the Yunnan Front Lines on the 12th)

Chiang's army, consisting of ten divisions and 150,000 troops, using the Nu Mountain Plateau as a stronghold, are watching intently, constantly seeking an opportunity to retake the Yunnan-Burma Highway. Our XX unit remains vigilant and prepared to shed our last drop of blood in the frozen land. On the third anniversary of this great war, with vast stretches of mist and smoke, they sent their sentiments to their fathers and elders in their homeland:

Part One

"It is unacceptable to call this hardship and sigh with complaint. Look at the enemy; they are also human, and they are suffering as well. The one who can overcome this hardship is the victor of the war. Not only should the soldiers on the front lines think this way, but also the people in the rear should have this understanding," said the XX Unit Commander. "What I hope to convey to the people in the rear is this point." On the face of this stern commander, unwavering determination shone.

The Chongqing army under Luo Zhuoying, which fled from northern Burma to India, mostly lay exposed in the fields, dying from the Black Death and cholera. The survivors are looked upon with disdain by the American and British armies, living as unwanted and superfluous burdens in a state of despair. The reality is such, yet they continue to promote it as the second front in Asia, which is truly the height of absurdity. Since we ravaged the Yunnan-Burma Highway in May, we have received much intelligence that the enemy is planning to secure the India Highway. It is believed that aid to Chiang includes not only weapons and fuel. Since we are aware that a century-long war is unavoidable, Chiang Kai-shek is also loudly calling for the necessity of resisting Japan and saving the nation. He has gathered many military supply factories around Chongqing, using "leap in production" as a slogan to encourage a leap in military supply production capacity. Therefore, the transportation of machine tools and equipment is something we absolutely cannot ignore. When the Yuan Dynasty invaded, our ancestors continued the war to destroy the enemy for twenty-nine long years, shedding an unknown amount of brave blood to barely prolong the nation's fate. We too must share this blood debt; we must fight to the end.

The XX Unit Commander said, "The soldiers are single-mindedly focused on flattening the Kunlun Mountains."

Part Two

An excerpt from a letter from a soldier to his younger brother in his hometown: Many words from the ancients are worth savoring. For example, "Stay long enough and you will become attached to the place." Having arrived here, at the barren and desolate Yunnan front lines, the saying "Stay long enough and you will become attached to the place" has become a reality. We are only interested in two things: killing the enemy and eating. The soldiers' favorite foods are walnuts, persimmons, chestnuts, yams, bananas, as well as mountain doves and wild rabbits. Each carries a taste of home, warming us from the tip of our tongues to the walls of our stomachs. I wanted to write this homesickness in a letter to send back, but looking up, I saw wild geese calling as they flew across the sky, so I entrusted this field communication to the wild geese. What do you think?

One comrade wrote the following few lines of poetry: Night dew falls on the eaves of the tent,

Dreaming of a grand entry into Chongqing on fog-laden streets,

The soldiers are dozing,

Brother, this Chinese mainland, where ten thousand heroic souls slumber, is precisely where we will bury our bones. A few days ago, the captured plainclothes unit included a sixteen-year-old boy, a fair-skinned child about your age. This young plainclothes member was captured at night while trying to cross the Nu River on a raft. In his pocket, he had two hand grenades. He answered our interrogation by saying, "For Chairman Chiang, I am prepared to die at any time." He said it decisively and then said nothing more. Think about it, there are many, many such young people in China.

However, there are also such things. An enemy deputy regimental commander named Zhang Gongzhong (lieutenant colonel rank) had a map in his bag, but he only had bundles of banknotes, which amounted to 30,000 yuan. After most of his regiment was annihilated, Zhang Zhongzuo received the salary for his regiment of two thousand men and openly embezzled a thousand men's worth into his private pocket. He confessed this without any sense of shame.

How foolish it is for Chinese soldiers to fight to the death under these corrupt officers. However, there are even more cunning cadres. According to prisoners, an enemy fifth army translator named Yang Zilong shed tears of sorrow and shook his fist towards Chongqing, saying, "Do you know why Soong Mei-ling went to America? It is because Chiang Kai-shek and his accomplices embezzled military funds and deposited them in American banks to calculate how much interest they would earn before they withdrew them. Also, because the war of resistance is becoming increasingly difficult, they want to buy more property abroad as soon as possible so that they can easily escape after stepping down from office. However, the extremely ignorant Chongqing army's soldiers are still kept in the dark and do not know this."

We felt that Yang Translator was too pitiful, so we did not continue the conversation. Brother, being in this corner of Yunnan, from which one can see the heart and lungs of Chongqing, and seeing through the many tricks of the Chiang regime's front and back stages, is such an interesting thing. In my next letter, I may report to you on many things inside Chiang's official residence in Chongqing. (Original article published in the Asahi Shimbun (Central China Edition) on December 15th) (Translated by Jiren)

### 5.6 Million Bags of Wheat to Be Shipped to Shanghai by Deadline for Distribution; Over 4 Million Bags of Flour Already Shipped North; Chinese and Japanese Manufacturers Obtain Loans Separately to Purchase Wheat

The former Asia Development Board's Central China Liaison Office has approved the shipment of 5.18 million bags of flour to North China. Except for a large portion that has already been shipped, there are still 800,000 bags that the Central China Flour Manufacturers Association will continue to ship to North China via sea and land routes.

Slight Extension of Shipping Deadline

It is reported that including this batch, the Central China Flour Industry Association has already exported 4.55 million bags of flour since April this year, with the remaining 630,000 bags awaiting shipment. According to the original plan, the 5.18 million bags of flour were to be shipped by the end of this month, but due to difficulties in purchasing, it was necessary to extend the deadline slightly. Furthermore, recently, local flour exporters signed an agreement with Hainan Island flour merchants to ship flour to the island, with 5,000 bags soon to be shipped.

Large Quantities of Raw Wheat Shipped to Shanghai in Steady Stream

It is also reported that regarding the purchase of raw wheat from various regions by local flour mills, 5.6 million bags of wheat will be shipped from various production areas in Central China between October this year and April next year. Among them, 4.48 million bags will come from the area around Shanghai, and the remaining 1.2 million bags will come from the Nanjing-Wuhu area. It is said that the official price limit for raw wheat is 180 Reserve Certificates. After shipping to Shanghai, the bags are distributed to various factories to start producing flour.

Banks Provide Loans for Purchasing Wheat in Designated Areas: Local Chinese Merchants Fuxin and Fufeng Flour Mills purchase raw wheat from various areas with loans from the Bank of China, Bank of Communications, Zhejiang Bank, Shanghai Bank, and Central South Bank, with permission from the Japanese authorities, under the joint control of the Central China Flour Industry Association, purchasing raw wheat from the Suzhou-Wuxi-Changzhou area. Japanese flour mills, on the other hand, obtain loans from Japanese banks to purchase from the Zhenjiang, Nanjing, and Wuhu areas, and are strictly controlled by a group of 27 Japanese merchants. As for transportation, it is jointly undertaken by the China Inland Shipping Company and the Central China Transportation Company.

### 150 Billion Old Currency Already Collected and Exchanged

Since June of this year, the amount of old currency collected and exchanged for Central Reserve Certificates has reached 150 billion yuan. Currently, the target for promoting Reserve Certificates has shifted from urban areas to the interior. The authorities now prohibit the circulation of old currency in areas where Reserve Certificates are recognized as the only currency, including Nanjing, Shanghai, and the rural areas near Suzhou, Jiaxing, Zhenjiang, and Hangzhou. The use of Reserve Certificates is also widespread in areas centered around Wuxi on both sides of the Yangtze River, and in areas centered around Bengbu in the Huai River basin. Recently, due to the expansion of the war situation, the circulation of Reserve Certificates has extended to the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway area, with Zhuji, Yiwu, and other places seemingly forming circulation centers for Reserve Certificates, and circulation is also rapid in the counties of Ningbo, Shaoxing, and Xiaoshan.

### Arbitration Matters of the Insurance Industry Arbitration Committee

In order to protect the legitimate rights and interests of merchants, in addition to establishing an Insurance Supervision Bureau, the Ministry of Industry submitted a proposal to the Executive Yuan and requested the Central Political Committee to approve and implement restrictions on the establishment of new insurance companies. It is stipulated that insurance companies must obtain a license before being allowed to operate, and existing companies should promptly register in accordance with the law. An Arbitration Committee has also been established, and its organization has been completed. The following is a record of the announcement: "The regulations of the Arbitration Committee of this Bureau have been submitted to the Ministry of Industry for approval and have been announced and implemented by the Bureau. Article 4 of the regulations stipulates the matters for arbitration as follows: A. Disputes between insurance companies; B. Disputes between insurance companies and brokers; C. Disputes between insurance companies and policyholders, insured persons, or beneficiaries; D. Disputes between insurance company employers and employees; E. Other arbitration matters related to the insurance industry. Now, the Arbitration Committee of this Bureau has been organized and established in accordance with the regulations. In the future, if insurance companies have disputes with various stakeholders, they can come to the Bureau to apply for arbitration."

### Separate Purchase Methods to Be Established for Oil and Sugar; In Addition to House Rent Receipts, Citizen Certificates Are Also Required; Severe Investigation of Price Gouging Should Be Conducted; New System for Oil Sales Can Be Agreed Upon Within One or Two Days

The Shanghai Edible Oil Industry Wholesale Office, with the approval of the military distribution authorities, originally planned to implement the purchase of edible oil based on house rent receipts and household registration certificates yesterday, after completing all allocation procedures. However, due to the discovery of forged house rent receipts, a special announcement was made to postpone it.

Slight Delay in Oil Sales

"This office's supply of edible oil to this city was originally scheduled to begin on December 20th, based on house rent receipts and household registration certificates. However, because the authorities have discovered some forged house rent receipts and need to seriously investigate and consider them, the date has been postponed for a few days." After the authorities' orders and regulations are set, they will be announced again. "This announcement is made for your information." A reporter from the Shanghai News Agency learned from the Wholesale Office yesterday that the ringleaders involved in the forgery of house rent receipts have been investigated and dealt with by the concession authorities. Therefore, the new system for edible oil sales will continue to be implemented, and it is expected that an agreement will be reached with the authorities today (Monday) before being announced again. However, to strengthen security, it may be necessary to follow the sugar industry's method: when purchasing edible oil, one must bring their own citizen certificate/ID card, and the address must match the house rent receipt to ensure seriousness and prevent abuses.

Investigating Sugar Traffickers

After the Sugar Merchant Cooperative implemented strict sales of sugar to prevent reselling for profit, starting yesterday, those who sell sugar based on house rent receipts must also bring their own citizen certificate with an address that matches the house rent receipt. It is said that some reselling households purchase house rent receipts at high prices and resell the sugar obtained to other areas, and some vendors are even raising prices in front of retail stores, exceeding the official price by more than double. Therefore, the authorities have been requested to take effective measures to maintain people's livelihoods. It is also heard that the Cooperative discovered cases of forged donation tickets being used to purchase sugar. In addition to strictly dealing with the arrested perpetrators in accordance with the law, it has also notified various sales supervisors and inspectors to pay attention to these forged donation tickets at all times and immediately report and arrest anyone found forging them.

### Practicing Light Control During Alert and Warning; Vehicles and Pedestrians Should Abide by Order

The city-wide air defense training exercises in the two concessions and the city area have been held seven times since the 14th. No alert was issued all day on the previous (19th), and the alert was only issued at 6:10 PM, so the streetlights were still on and vehicles were still running, which was called the alert state. The warning was lifted at 6:00 AM yesterday (20th), and the normal state was restored. Then, at the same time last night, the alert was issued again. The purpose of this exercise is to control lighting, so that residents can become familiar with the process quickly and efficiently.

Pujiang Fire Extinguishing Drill

For the sake of training air defense on the river, the local air defense authorities, under the guidance of the Naval Port Affairs Department, designated the Yuanhe Wheel of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, which was moored in the heart of the river, as the target, and assumed that incendiary bombs had fallen on the deck of the ship and ignited a fire, and that many people were killed or injured. This river fire extinguishing training was the first of its kind since the implementation of air defense training in the area. Participants were mainly from the Customs Port Affairs Department, and were assisted by the Maritime Police, Customs Police, Municipal Council Fire Brigade, water and soil conservation guards, groups, and other relevant agencies. The fierce fire was extinguished in just ten minutes, and the exercise ended at 4:20 PM. It was assessed that the results were quite good.

Laozha Rescue Performance

The seventh Bao of the second Lianbao in the Laozha District of the Public Concession held an air defense rescue exercise at 10:00 AM yesterday at the intersection of Hankou Road and Zhejiang Road, in front of the Lao Dongfang Hotel. Lianbao Chief Zhang Songtao and Bao Chief Chen Xiangjiu served as instructors. Qiaoben of the Japanese Navy Concession Force, Laozha Police Director Nakano, Criminal Section Chief, the chief of the Baojia system Okumura, and others came to guide the exercise. The exercise began at 10:00 AM, with performances of fire extinguishing and rescue. The techniques were extremely proficient, the performance was realistic, and the results were very satisfactory.

### Cracking Down on Illegal Meat Merchants

The authorities of the two concessions have not relaxed their efforts to investigate the implementation of price limits for meat in various vegetable markets by sending personnel to investigate. Recently, many meat shops and stalls in small vegetable markets have been punished or suspended for violating price evaluations or having insufficient weights.

### Central Reserve Bank Plans to Establish Foreign Exchange Department to Handle Remittances from Overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia; Officially Established in Early Spring

While banks in the city are busy with year-end accounting, the Central Reserve Bank is actively planning to establish a foreign exchange department, as the bank's business is developing and it has to expand greatly. It is reported that the department is expected to be officially established in the early spring of next year, focusing on remittance business between the bank and overseas Chinese, especially in Southeast Asia. The office will be located on the fifth floor of the Central Reserve Bank at No. 15 on the Bund.

### International Red Cross Distributes Gifts to Prisoners of War

The Shanghai office of the International Red Cross will hold its second distribution of gifts to prisoners of war held in Shanghai this month on the afternoon of the 22nd. Christmas gifts will also be distributed in small quantities at that time.

### List of Letters Received from Europe (Continued)

### Money Shops Rush to Complete Final Accounting; Cash Withdrawals from Bank Limited to Daily Deposit Amount; Central Reserve Bank and Banking Association Handle Interbank Lending

The financial industry's year-end accounting period has arrived, and banks are rushing to complete interest calculation: (1) Savings departments began handling it yesterday; (2) Commercial departments are scheduled to begin on the 25th. After this interest calculation is completed, it will be credited to the accounts of various current deposit holders, and each bank will notify each depositor. However, funds deposited after the interest calculation period will be calculated again at the end of June next year. All loans will be handled in accordance with the contracts signed with the borrowers, but overdrafts must be fully repaid before the final accounting and can be resumed on the market on January 5th next year. The overdraft amount will be negotiated separately based on the credit of each current account holder. The money shops' settlement of interest on deposits and debts is usually handled on a monthly basis. The market for interest on deposits and debts for December will be settled after a resolution is reached at a public meeting. Only ordinary accounting is handled at the end of the Gregorian year. The final accounting is usually handled on Lunar New Year's Eve.

Tightening Credit, Rising Interest Rates on Foreign Exchange

Credit has tightened during the final accounting period, and the interest rate on foreign exchange in the money market has risen to 22%. According to Shanghai News Agency's inquiry with the financial industry, the reasons for the tightening of credit are: (1) Various industries need cash to be remitted to peaceful areas to purchase agricultural products such as cotton, wheat, grains, and beans; (2) Floating capital is concentrated in Shanghai, and newly established banks, money shops, trust companies, and other enterprises need it. In addition, banks have temporarily suspended all loans due to accounting reasons during this final accounting period.

Efforts to Adjust and Stabilize Finance

The Money Industry Joint Reserve has recently notified its member shops that if any shop needs to withdraw cash, it should be limited to the amount of daily deposits to limit withdrawals.

### Checking of Residence Permits for Travel to Nanshi Temporarily Postponed

The checking of identity and residence permits of pedestrians at the iron gates between Nanshi and the concessions has been quite strict since the 16th. Those without permits or carrying previously issued old permits are not allowed to pass. This has been reported in this newspaper. However, this inspection work only lasted for one day. It is heard that the reason is that the issuance of residence permits in Nanshi and the western districts has not yet been completed. The absence of permits for pedestrians traveling through creates difficulties for the inspection. After discussion by the authorities, the inspection work has been temporarily postponed.

### Adding Place Names to Stamps May Be Implemented on New Year's Day

Aimed at Preventing Mutual Posting for Profit

Regarding the addition of place names to stamps by the Shanghai Postal Administration, a reporter from the Datong News Agency learned that this matter will take effect on New Year's Day next year. This measure is sufficient to prevent the malpractice of mutual posting of stamps for profit due to the differences in currency systems. However, the post office has not yet announced whether the stamps will be printed with provincial place names or a general name.

Staff members now personally investigate the poor and issue porridge tickets, which can be used to drink porridge or take it home for a meal. A thousand sets of winter clothes donated by all sectors of society have been distributed to those in need, but many poor people still lack winter clothes. It is hoped that people from all walks of life will actively donate. Candy and food will still be prepared for distribution during Christmas.

### Eastern League Cup Charity Football Tournament, Second Act: Eastern League Loses to Western League by One Goal; No Goals in the First Half, One Goal Conceded in the Second Half

The second act of the Eastern League Cup Charity Football Tournament, organized by the Shanghai Branch of the East Asia League China General Association, took place yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM at Jiaozhou Park between the East China United Friendship Team and the Western League Team. Although there was continuous drizzle yesterday morning, fortunately, the sky cleared and the rain stopped half an hour before the match, allowing the great game to proceed smoothly, as if heaven had intentionally intervened to help. The two sides played with equal skill and strength, and the match was not affected by the weather. The result was that the Eastern League lost by a score of 1-0. The first half ended 0-0.

Thrilling and Exciting

Secretary-General Chen Fumu of the Association kicked off the match, and the Eastern League launched the first attack. Youliang sent a corner kick, which was headed by A'dai but intercepted by McNitey. Schevita of the Western League took a free kick, aiming straight for the goal, but it was saved by Xianhan. Youliang, Long Hailin, and Jinglu repeatedly launched attacks, but all came to nothing. Thereafter, the two sides exchanged attacks, but neither achieved anything, and the first half ended 0-0. During the break, a charity football was auctioned off, and Councilor Cen Zhengwu bid 22,000 taels of silver to purchase it, and then re-auctioned the ball. Mr. Pan Sanxing also bid 22,000 taels of silver to purchase it.

The Battle Resumes

The Western League replaced Fuen with Baojie as the right inside forward. Except for Su Ruo, the five forwards were all navy soldiers, and their cooperation was excellent, increasing their offensive power. On the Eastern League side, their stamina was somewhat lacking, and they were running out of energy, but fortunately, the players were determined and continued to shoot at the goal, forcing McNitey to run back and forth tirelessly. After lasting for thirty minutes, the referee failed to notice that Song Lingsheng had committed a handball in the penalty area, and penalized the Eastern League twice in a row. Sun Jinshun was then judged to have encroached under non-existent facts, and Schevita took a free kick. With a long pass, Dipanna waited by the goal, leaped up, and headed the ball, which grazed the crossbar and went into the right corner. Although Xianhan tried to save it, it was too late. After the goal, the Eastern League launched a full-scale counterattack, but time was not on their side. In the end, the Eastern League unfortunately lost to the Western League by this groundless goal.

### The Decisive Battle Continues (3): Broadcast Speech by Heihide, Head of the Navy Press Department; Translated from the December Issue of "Yomiuri Hochi"

The Current Stage of the War

Judging from the development of the above naval battles and the state of combat, it is clear that these naval battles can be regarded as a "series of decisive sea battles." This illustrates the characteristics of modern naval warfare, which is unprecedented. The great significance of air power in operations has been clearly demonstrated in actual combat. Secondly, based on its strong production capacity, the enemy, regardless of the defeat in previous decisive naval battles, continues to stubbornly resist, shouting, "Final victory will surely belong to me..." We must not easily overlook these facts.

In the Russo-Japanese War, Russia lost its will to fight after being defeated in the Battle of the Sea of Japan, and the war ended quickly in a relatively short period. In this Greater East Asia War, the end of the war is not so easy to determine. On this point, there is a fundamental difference between the two wars, which deserves special attention.

Secondly, we can see that the enemy attaches particular importance to the Solomon Islands, and it is sparing no effort to ensure the safety of the Solomon Islands. Therefore, the enemy's offensive in the Solomon Islands is an unprecedented large-scale active operation. The United States is currently publicizing this as a "major decisive battle against Japan." The people also think: "After the Japanese army attacked Pearl Harbor, they regained the initiative from Japan in eight months." The American people, who are always deceived by propaganda about victory, are easily complacent and carried away. "The United States and the United Nations have begun a major advance in the Pacific, and the tide of the Pacific is about to turn back." It is as if the Japanese army has been defeated, and they are now intoxicated in the illusion of victors. American military experts also claim this to be "a major decisive battle to break the balance of power in the Pacific," placing great hope on this naval battle around the Solomon Islands.

Hanson Baldwin, a famous military commentator, recently returned from inspecting the front lines in the Pacific. In the New York Times, he criticized the first Battle of the Solomon Islands: "After the American fleet received reports from aircraft that the Japanese fleet was approaching, it remained silent and only fired its cannons two or three times. Therefore, the responsibility for this cannot be solely attributed to Governor Ghormley. This completely exposes the 'excessive defense' mentality. If this is not corrected, the United States may be defeated." He disregarded the document from the U.S. Navy Department and spread the news of the American fleet's crushing defeat.

In the Solomon Islands, many of our brave warriors are also throwing themselves at the enemy as human bombs. When we think of these brave warriors who sacrificed themselves for the country, we cannot help but feel respect and offer our deepest condolences. However, as we said earlier, a single attack against the enemy in the Solomon Islands cannot determine the overall victory or defeat of the war. Because the United States is mobilizing its vast production capacity, the war is still in its early stages.

The Enemy's War Preparedness

Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the United States has lost about nine battleships, about ten aircraft carriers, twenty-nine cruisers, fifty destroyers, and about fifty submarines in the year or so up to recently. At this time, while repairing the damaged ships, it also announced a fairly lively large shipbuilding plan. According to foreign newspaper reports, since the start of the war, four battleships, six anti-aircraft cruisers, and more than ten aircraft carriers and special aircraft carriers have been completed one after another. Furthermore, judging from the new ships that have appeared in various naval battles, the shipbuilding effort has achieved considerable results and is credible.

Also, because of the focus on aircraft carriers, the number of aircraft has also increased dramatically. It is said that the number of aircraft recently exceeded 4,000 in one month, and 84 merchant ships of 10,000 tons each were completed in November.

At the same time, several of our elite new battleships have also been commissioned long ago. Since the start of the war, our unique aircraft carriers, cruisers, and other ships, which have received combat training in the field, are also being built and commissioned one by one. In this way, our maritime power is growing, and our prestige is increasing.

Compared to each other, we can be confident of victory without any problems. Therefore, we must never overestimate the enemy's production capacity based solely on numbers, which would lead to a retreatist mentality. However, we must deeply consider the significance of modern warfare as a consumptive long-term war. In particular, we must clearly recognize that the production battlefield is directly related to the battlefield. The purpose of the war is to thoroughly destroy the enemy's resistance and lose their will to fight, so as to win the final victory. Therefore, winning in individual battles does not mean overall victory. Especially in this war, there is absolutely no room for compromise before the final victory is achieved.

Of course, even if it is a long-term war, the first year or two will truly determine the overall trend of the war; but in any case, this still depends on the determination and efforts of the military, officials, and civilians as a whole.

In short, we must sacrifice everything, contribute every bit of strength, and serve the Emperor with one heart as patriotic and loyal Japanese subjects. In this way, the 3,000-year history of our divine nation can be preserved. December 8th of the second year of the war can truly be said to be the "new starting point" for completely destroying the enemy. The decisive battle is underway and will continue to be waged.

### Who Do You Rely On For Food?

— Tao Zhi

Went to visit a friend.

The gatekeeper went in to inform him, and I waited there. I happened to see a piece of paper pasted on the wall, which I thought was for the young gatekeeper to encourage himself. The paper read: "Sweat your own sweat, eat your own food. Relying on heaven, relying on people, relying on ancestors, none of them are good heroes." What was said was indeed very good.

But now, it is very difficult to truly "sweat your own sweat" and be able to "eat your own food." Even if you are lucky enough not to starve to death and are able to eat a mouthful of bitter food, at most you will only be a gatekeeper for the rest of your life, and a small clerk will only be a small clerk for the rest of your life. In your own mind, you may be proud of yourself as a "hero" in an Ah Q-like way, but in the eyes of others, you will be said to be a failure because you are a gatekeeper for the rest of your life.

The path to "success" in this society is not to "sweat your own sweat," but to "rely on heaven, rely on people, rely on ancestors." Many people insist on pretending to be "heroes" in their own minds, but they have gone down the wrong path and ended up as semi-dead failures. "Successful" people do not need to sweat their own sweat, but they can sweat the sweat of others. The important thing is to have good ancestors to support the facade, good relatives and friends to back you up, and to be able to flatter, fawn, and charm people.

But if this society all becomes people who "rely on heaven, rely on people, rely on ancestors," and there are no people who "sweat their own sweat," I am worried about what kind of world this will become.

### The Venerable Mr. Chen

— Temporary Name

Saving all living beings is the purpose of Buddhism, and sacrificing oneself to save others is the purpose of Jesus. Although the two religions have different doors, the spirit of saving people is the same. It is a pity that in the arena of fame and wealth, it is difficult to find this kind of spirit of willingness to sacrifice.

Yesterday, my friend introduced me to a friend named Chen (the founder of the Confucian Mercy Orphanage). I couldn't help but be surprised to find that there was such a person in the world who was willing to sacrifice himself.

Mr. Chen has a lot of research in Chinese and Western knowledge. Because of the death of his beloved daughter, he was greatly stimulated. He believes that separation of life and death is the most painful thing. Therefore, he decided to give up fame and wealth for the rest of his life to help orphans, so as to comfort others and also to comfort himself. However, after surviving the calamity, there was no way to realize his wish. He had a whimsical idea. In Zhenjiang, he carried a bucket of lime and spent the whole day writing slogans on the walls of the streets, urging people to do good. This action undoubtedly aroused the attention of the authorities. After several investigations and summonses, they all expressed sympathy. Finally, the county magistrate asked him how the expenses would be settled if he wanted to help orphans. He replied: "Do as much as you can. If you can support an orphan, support one. As long as you are willing to work hard and are willing to sacrifice, nothing is impossible." The county magistrate was very moved and immediately designated the library on the top of Yuntai Mountain, which had been destroyed, as a place to house orphans. He immediately took his wife and ran to the mountain. When he saw that the doors and windows were broken, he did not hesitate to work hard and used all his possessions to purchase the necessary materials. The couple repaired it day and night. Once, it was late at night, and he found that there were two nails missing on the window. He immediately ran from the top of the mountain to the bottom of the mountain, knocked on the hardware store that had already closed, bought the nails, and ran back to the mountain to repair the window.

At this time, he had already adopted two orphans. Because of the tight budget, he only ate one meal a day and saved the rations to support the orphans. He still has the same spirit today.

At first, the local gentry laughed at him as a madman, but his spirit finally moved the people who ridiculed him. Some people helped with rice, and some people donated money. He slowly adopted orphans, and today there are twenty-four of them. He believes that raising them without teaching them is a regret after all. So he hired two enthusiastic and knowledgeable teachers to share the responsibility of saving orphans with him. His wife took on the responsibility of washing the children's clothes and taking care of the orphans' meals and accommodation. She has done this day after day for several years without the slightest complaint. Every morning at five o'clock, she wakes up the orphans and does morning exercises together. After the exercises, they eat breakfast together. After breakfast, they sweep the place with the orphans. They have classes at eight o'clock. In the afternoon, they work in the garden with the orphans. They teach them how to do good and how to be a person at any time and any place. Therefore, very polite children are found on this mountaintop at any time.

His spirit and his achievements have been highly praised by the local gentry. They went to the top of the mountain to ask him about it several times. He focused all his energy on the orphans and never dressed up his appearance. The gentry only knew his name but did not know his person. No one could have imagined that the unassuming person was the great man who worked hard to save orphans. When the gentry asked him: "Is Mr. Chen at home?" He quickly replied: "He went down the mountain." Later, after many times, the gentry became suspicious. Once, they went to the mountain to visit again and sat down without leaving, insisting on seeing Mr. Chen. After sitting for almost an hour, he felt that there was no way to avoid it this time, so he had to come out and admit that he was Mr. Chen. The gentry asked him the reason for not seeing guests. He replied: "The social people express their sympathy for me, just looking at my achievements, not at me, Mr. Chen. I, Mr. Chen, am willing to work so hard, just for the sake of the orphans, not for myself. Why must I let people know me?"

As the number of orphans increased and prices soared, he often worried and said to himself: "It is a great sin to fail to do good." His anxious mood aroused a friend's instruction, urging him to use the garden to plant figs extensively. Then, the harvest next year will not be without some help. He immediately knelt down and thanked him, and then ran to Shanghai to buy 3,000 plants, tied them into bundles, carried them to the North Railway Station, and after various difficulties, finally transported them all to the mountain. However, enduring hunger and braving wind and rain, he fell ill as a result. Others might wait until they got better before planting. But he did not. He believes that planting one day earlier means that the orphans' livelihood will be guaranteed one day earlier. He got up while still ill and planted them one by one with his wife. Now, you can already see very lush fig trees in the garden. There is a lack of well water on the mountain, and they are reluctant to use tap water, but figs cannot be without water for a day. So he gets up every day in the middle of the night, carries two iron buckets, runs down the mountain to fetch water, and then runs back to the mountain to irrigate. He runs up and down like this until he sees the orphans doing morning exercises. It is a pity that when others are sleeping soundly under the blankets, it is the time when he is running to fetch water on the mountain under the stars and moon. He often says: "Heaven knows, it should see this heart."

Although he despises fame and wealth, his deeds have spread very quickly. Enthusiastic people admire his spirit and also pity his east-to-west planning. Some people are willing to donate dozens of acres of wasteland so that he can farm and feed himself, so that he can be spared the worry of "failing to do good" day and night. He was of course grateful beyond words, but was his anxiety not beyond words? He believes that the land is there, but how to raise funds for reclamation. He sighed all day long, and those who saw him were moved. The gentry sympathized with his hard work and agreed to lend him the paintings and calligraphy they had collected for him to exhibit and raise funds. He was overjoyed and ran to Shanghai, running around everywhere. He was alone for more than a month. Sure enough, his enthusiasm moved the support of celebrities in Shanghai, and the painting and calligraphy exhibition was held in the Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association.

Mr. Chen's deeds are close to the selflessness of Buddhism, the self-restraint of Confucianism, and the sacrifice of Jesus. This great spirit is worthy of people's admiration. If it can be promoted, it may not be the gospel of the general orphans. At the very least, his hard work of sacrificing himself to save others and saving orphans is worth offering to the society and should not be obliterated. As for his greatness, it is not convenient to announce it in order to fulfill his heart not to admire fame. Fortunately, the exhibition has not yet closed, and the orphans on the top of Yuntai Mountain are still there, and interested people have the opportunity to visit.

### Inscriptions and Prefaces

— Objective

If we go to bookstores or libraries to browse books, we often see inscriptions or prefaces at the beginning of the books. Although we have not made precise statistics, we can at least say with certainty that there are particularly many inscriptions or prefaces in the publications of our recent decades, and they are all superficial, empty, and useless. In some books, the inscriptions and prefaces that people are invited to write take up as many as twenty or thirty pages. The people who write inscriptions and prefaces are either important people or celebrities, and they have nothing to do with the content of the book. The most ridiculous thing is that a literary book has many inscriptions and prefaces by illiterate soldiers, and the content is empty and pedantic, just like writing an obituary.

Speaking of the matter itself, it is not absolutely impossible to ask people to write inscriptions and prefaces. If you write a meaningful manuscript and send it to an authoritative scholar in this field for review and criticism, the authoritative scholar can write a few words or write a valuable preface, which can increase the reader's interest and understanding. This is originally a meaningful work.

However, the current situation is not like this at all. Many manuscripts are edited rather than written, so there is no need to write inscriptions and prefaces; but they make a big fuss and invite some irrelevant celebrities to write, so as to "climb the dragon" and become famous. Those celebrities who specialize in writing inscriptions and prefaces are so busy or lazy that they have not even seen the original manuscript, but they write it "out of thin air" and "seriously," doing their best to flatter and praise. In fact, it's just mutual promotion! Sometimes, the author prepares the words or articles in advance and asks the celebrity to copy them or sign a name on them for publication. They "look at each other and smile, and understand each other's hearts."

In ancient times, authors often said some polite words such as "disaster pear and disaster jujube" in their prefaces. If it is really a "disaster pear and disaster jujube," then the first thing that should be is the boring inscriptions and prefaces.

"Insufficient gains" The same is true for inscriptions and prefaces. Many books, especially translations, absolutely need a preface that introduces and criticizes the original work for the sake of readers. But most translators are too lazy to add it. Maybe this is hiding clumsiness? But the readers suffer.

Sincerely, I hope that writers and publishers in general will consider the interests of readers and the cost of publications; and always remember this principle: increase the benefits for readers without increasing the burden on readers' purchases.

### Talking About Rats

— Ji Si

The "old" in rats does not contain the meaning of age; because newborn rats are called small rats, which, like the "old" in small tigers, does not mean anything.

Northerners call rats "haozi," which does express the characteristics of rats; because rats are consuming to us humans. If there are rats in the house, food, clothing, and even utensils will all be consumed.

According to Darwin's theory of evolution, rats appeared in the world earlier than humans. From ancient times to the present, rats have been said to have hundreds of disadvantages and not a single advantage to humans. The Book of Songs records things about rats, such as "Who says a rat has no teeth? How can it pierce the walls!"

"Big rat, big rat, do not eat my millet!... Big rat, big rat, do not eat my wheat!... Big rat, big rat, do not eat my seedlings!..." There is no good feeling for rats. As for all the nouns, all those involving rats are also used to express the meaning of insult and contempt, such as "rat," "rat skills," "rat generation," "rat scurrying," "rat looking," "rat theft," "deer head and rat eyes," etc.

Generally superstitious people attach great importance to the actions of rats. If they hear the sound of "rats counting money" in the evening, it is said to indicate that there is wealth coming; if it is in the morning, it is said to indicate that wealth is going out. In fact, it's just that when rats encounter danger, all the hair on their bodies stands up, and their mouths make a sound that seems like people counting copper coins.

In old houses, snakes often eat rats in summer. The snake surrounds the rat circle by circle with its slender, rope-like body. The rat makes a pitiful squeaking sound. People should feel happy when rats are swallowed by snakes. But because people are very afraid of snakes, they feel fear instead of seeing snakes eating rats, and treat it as an ominous thing.

With the development of science, pathologists have confirmed that rats can transmit a disease called "plague" or "black death"; the rats are even more guilty of being the public enemy of mankind. Therefore, eliminating rats is regarded as a necessary measure. Iron wire cages, iron clips, and even phosphorus paste for poisoning rats are constantly being made!

In ancient times, people used weasels to catch rats. Weasels are also called yellow weasels, and they are very good at catching rats; but they also love to steal chickens. The weasel catches rats on one hand and steals chickens on the other. In people's eyes, the merits are not enough to cover the sins. After careful consideration, people no longer raise weasels to catch rats, but instead raise cats.

During the war, people especially cherish food; therefore, they are even more hostile to rats. We hope that after Shanghai prohibits spitting, there will be a "rat extermination campaign."

### Sharing the Boat Through Storms

— Xiang Jia Zhi

12. Backyard Flowers

Auntie Chen, who worked for the Wei Cheng and others, had left, hesitating for a moment. Thinking that if Guo Fang received my letter and hurried back, it definitely wouldn't be this quick. So Guo Fang was originally planning to return. Why didn't she wait until tomorrow or the day after? If she came back tomorrow or the day after, Huang Long would be here. I'm assuming I should answer the call now. According to Auntie Chen, isn't there still a Miss Zhu at her house? Wei Cheng paced back and forth in the room, sometimes with his hands behind his back, sometimes with both hands on the table. The first thing he had to decide was his attitude towards Guo Fang. He thought for a long time and almost didn't want to stay at the Wang Shun Xing Inn anymore. He just wanted to shrink his neck and go straight home, pretending not to know that Guo Fang had ever returned to Shuangqiao. Then, he slammed the table and suddenly remembered what he had said to Huang Long. Huang Long laughed at me for only being able to raise this hand to kill the enemy's son, but not being able to raise that hand to kill the enemy's daughter. What did I say at the time? As soon as Wei Cheng thought of this, he immediately mustered up some courage, pulled out the knife that Huang Long had hidden under the mattress, held it in his hand and tested it, then backed away a few steps, aimed at the edge of the bed, and threw it from a distance. If this throw had come from Huang Long, there's no need to say, it would definitely have gone in three inches, with the knife handle swaying on the edge of the bed like a willow in the wind. But now, Wei Cheng's throw was too far from his intended expectation. The knife and the edge of the bed didn't make any contact, and it just fell to the ground with a clatter. Wang the madman asked from outside the door, "Mr. Ye, what fell?"

Wei Cheng was thinking, if he didn't go to the Chen's house soon, Auntie Chen would come again. He held the knife, paid Wang the madman fifty dollars for room and board, and walked out of the inn in the dim twilight. He pursed his lips, put on what he thought was a smile, and stepped onto the street. At first, he walked at a normal pace, but then he gradually slowed down. He saw that the shops in Shuangqiao Town still had a New Year atmosphere, and the black characters written on the red paper could be faintly seen. Looking again, two large elm trees appeared in front of him, this was Chen Guo Fang's house. His heart almost jumped out of his mouth. Suddenly, he turned around and ran wildly. (248)

### A Reporter's Visit to the Divine Soldiers in the Gaoligong Mountains (Part Two)

In the Trenches on the Yunnan Front

On this friendly army position, there is a pine forest at an elevation of 5,200 feet, where white and yellow alpine plants sway pitifully in the morning breeze. Behind the trenches, many simple huts have been built. These are soldiers' small huts that serve as kitchens and dining halls, and also as rest rooms. Adjacent to the small huts, there are no chicken coops or pig pens. On the chicken coop's wire mesh and on the sloping roof of the small hut, there are also many red persimmons drying in the sun.

"To fight such a war and still make the people at home uneasy is too much to say. We are now on the front line, practicing this kind of local self-sufficiency. Raising chickens and pigs is also for this purpose. On the first day of the New Year, we plan to have a big feast!"

The soldier "on cooking duty" said with a smile.

In addition, many exercise equipment and movable logs have been built on the position. It is said that this is the only effective way to get rid of epidemics.

During the rainy season from June to early October, the soldiers rarely eat vegetables. Sometimes, they have to fill their stomachs with goosefoot and pumpkin vines. But they don't utter a word of complaint and are still fighting stubbornly. When asked, then—

"Is everyone at home doing well? What exactly happened with the American air raid on April 18th?" These two questions are repeatedly asked. To these two points, I answered them like this:

"Even with such a big war going on, the country is still dealing with it calmly. The lives of the Japanese people are very rich. The American air raid on April 18th was nothing. The captured pilots were severely punished. The enemy's guerrilla-like psychological warfare, on the contrary, only created the opposite effect. Now, everyone is excited and unanimously saying: What's so scary about an air raid!"

After that, I told them two stories: one was about a servant who bravely fought the enemy with an incendiary bomb; the other was about an old woman who used a rice bucket to put out an incendiary bomb. The soldiers, upon hearing this, all shouted "Unbelievable, unbelievable" and cheered. The unit commander added:

"Here, I call it Takamagahara. Overlooking from a high vantage point, with the clouds and rainbows in sight, this place can simply be called a paradise. In terms of daily life, although we feel various inconveniences, the enemy is right in front of us, and we always hold the hope of going to war and a burning fighting spirit. Before these hopes and fighting spirits, the minor inconveniences of life are simply not worth mentioning. It is said that there are hermits living among the clouds and mists, and we who stand on the front line, encouraged by the burning 'fighting soul', are close to that state. Therefore, there is nothing to worry about on the front line. The wish of our front-line soldiers is to always hope that the people in the rear are invigorated and that they live a warm and prosperous life…"

Here, in the Takamagahara of Yunnan, what I saw was the admirable heroic posture of these divine soldiers who were determined to support the Greater East Asia War.

From Yangon to the Forefront

The so-called Burma Road refers to the 1,100-kilometer road from Kunming in Yunnan Province to Lashio in Burma. From Lashio to Yangon, the same 1,100 kilometers, runs parallel to the railway line, and there is also a flat paved road, on which trucks loaded with aid supplies for Chiang pass. I first flew by plane from Yangon to Meimyo, then took a train from Meimyo to Mandalay, from Mandalay to Lashio, and then from Lashio, I took a covered night truck to the forefront, passing through Wanting, Mangshi, Longling, and other places, directly reaching the first line of the Nu River, and traversed more than 1,500 kilometers of winding Burma Road. One clear morning, the plane left Mingaladon Airport, and below I saw the rich fields representing the "Rice Country" of Burma. The Irrawaddy River was on the left. A little further north, I reached Bago, with its red earth and green fields. The dense forests of neem trees, the Irrawaddy River spreading out in all directions like spider legs, and the turbid brown current flowing torrentially there. The plane turned right over Yangon and arrived at Meimyo. This is a plateau at an altitude of 2,700 feet. During the hot season, the Myanmar central government always moves its offices here from Rangoon.

After arriving in Meimyo, I changed to a car and traveled 68 kilometers in the opposite direction on the Burma Road to reach Yangon. Yangon is a very bleak place, with scorched earth everywhere. All the street trees, such as Bauhinia, have been burned. This was set on fire by Chinese arsonists before our army occupied it. Only the area near the former royal city still has some remaining greenery. The water in the moat and the spires of the pagodas on Yangon Hill decorate this desolate ruin. It is said that after the scorched earth, epidemics are prevalent in this area!
