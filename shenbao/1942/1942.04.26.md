### France Holds Second Cabinet Meeting: Decides to Focus on Reforming Domestic Affairs; Selecting New Personnel for Important Positions; Discussion on Restoring General Affairs Meetings

Vichy, 25th (Havas) – The cabinet held a state council meeting at 10:30 AM, presided over by Marshal Pétain.

Vichy, 24th (Havas) – Since Prime Minister Laval formed his cabinet, he has been extremely diligent in handling state affairs. It is now scheduled to hold its second cabinet meeting tomorrow, with all ministers and department heads in attendance. It is reported that the meeting will discuss various domestic issues. Domestic issues have been the focus of criticism in newspapers in the occupied territories. For example, the Bordeaux "Petit Gironde" expressed regret over the government's dissolution of local councils a year ago, replacing them with special committees appointed by the central administrative organs. It advocated for the restoration of these elected councils, arguing that centrally appointed committee members are not only politically motivated but also lack experience in local administration. Therefore, well-informed sources believe that the new government will focus on reforming local administration. Prime Minister Laval's concurrent role as Minister of the Interior demonstrates his serious attention to this issue. Another issue that the new government urgently seeks to resolve is the social question. Today's editorial in the local "Effort" newspaper touched on Prime Minister Laval's discussion of future European socialism, and strongly advocated for social conservatism. Prime Minister Laval has already condemned this, indicating that the new government's goal is to complete socialism, placing capital under labor. In other words, capital will be a tool of humanity, not its master. French socialists have made unparalleled contributions to various plans for building a new Europe, but their views are opposed by the royalist mouthpiece "Action Française". This newspaper's traditional view is that "socialism is destructive" and is the inevitable consequence of parliamentary politics, only leading to human suffering and destruction. The newspaper also stated that only the essence of Marshal Pétain's speech in Saint-Étienne is worthy as the most perfect form of socialism. However, this kind of socialism is completely different from that advocated by former Popular Front Prime Minister Blum. Its goal is to replace proletarianism with a truly humane concept of labor.

Vichy, 25th (Haitong) – Following the reorganization of the French administrative system, the head of state, the prime minister, and the commanders-in-chief of the army, navy, and air force are currently selecting new personnel to take on important positions. Marshal Pétain is reorganizing his directly-controlled offices, and will recall Minister of Civil Affairs Baudoin to Vichy to assist with all political affairs, but his authority will be somewhat limited. Maritime Governor Robinet will also be recalled to Vichy to assist the head of state with political affairs. Prime Minister Laval is also seeking new candidates for the three ministries of Interior, Foreign Affairs, and Information, to simplify the organization of each ministry. There is also talk of re-establishing the General Affairs Meeting that was dissolved last year. Commander-in-Chief Darlan has reportedly appointed the chiefs of staff of the three armed forces: Vice Admiral Barthet as Chief of Naval Staff, Major General Le Van as Chief of Army Staff, and Colonel Moninvaud as Chief of Air Staff. Yesterday, the French Official Gazette published a decree stating that air defense administrative matters will be handled by the Police Department.

Paris, 25th (Haitong) – French Finance Minister Jadala has recommended increasing funds to relieve unemployed people. The unemployed can also receive preferential treatment such as travel expenses, with the aim of completely eliminating unemployment. The second new reform is a partial lifting of restrictions on alcohol.

Britain, the United States, and South Africa Monitor the Situation in Madagascar

London, 25th (Reuters) – Britain, the United States, and South Africa are closely monitoring the situation in Madagascar. The meeting between Vichy's new Prime Minister Laval and Japanese Ambassador Takanobu Mitani is particularly noteworthy. If Madagascar falls, the Allied supply lines in the Indian Ocean to Indochina, the Soviet Union, and the Middle East would be severely threatened, and traffic between Ceylon and the Cape of Good Hope would also be cut off. South African Prime Minister Smuts' decision to sever relations with France is very significant. It is reported that Laval intends to govern simultaneously in both Vichy and Paris. The former will be the location of the cabinet members, while the latter will be the location of his state officials. It is believed that Brinon will be Laval's chief aide, continuing to liaise with the German government and German representative in Paris, Abetz. Méthey will be the deputy aide, responsible for handling minor coordination matters. Admiral Beraud is rumored to be appointed as the liaison officer between the Vichy military and the government. London circles believe that Laval clearly intends to use this method to seize Darlan's military power and take on the role himself.

Vichy, 25th (Havas) – According to Parisian newspapers, Laval has summoned Chadiel, Governor-General of French Algeria in North Africa; Vice Admiral Estéva, Resident-General of French Tunisia; General Noguès, Resident-General of French Morocco; and Boisson, Governor-General of French West Africa, to return to Vichy for consultations. It is also rumored that Laval has decided to directly contact the governors of the French provinces, several of whom will soon be summoned to Vichy.

Vichy, 25th (Haitong) – The delegation of the Muslim Union of Oran, representing all Muslims in Algeria, sent a telegram to French Prime Minister Laval, expressing their determination to be loyal to the French government and support national policies.

Vichy, 24th (Havas) – Officials recently confirmed that the Union of South Africa has severed diplomatic relations with France.

Vichy, 25th (Haitong) – The French Foreign Ministry issued a statement yesterday stating that the news of France's severing diplomatic relations with South Africa only came from British reports.

### Australian Foreign Minister Delivers Speech in the United States; Evatt to Visit England

Washington, 25th (Reuters) – Australian Federal Foreign Minister Dr. Evatt, who has been visiting the United States for many days with a delegation, is scheduled to visit Prime Minister Churchill in London within the next few days. Evatt announced this last night in a speech in New York, stating that the lessons learned from the Gallipoli campaign in the Near East during the last European war should be remembered. The reason for the failure of this campaign was the misconception at the time that the outcome of the war depended on the Western Front, and that other theaters of war were secondary, only serving to disperse forces. It was not until after the war that it was acknowledged that if the Allied forces had deployed greater force in that campaign, the war could have been shortened by several years.

### General Maeda Discusses the Development of Borneo

Rome, 25th (Havas) – General Maeda, Governor-General of Borneo and commander of the Japanese forces in the region, gave a speech to reporters from the embassy here yesterday, elaborating on various plans for the development of Borneo. He stated briefly that the thorough clearing of enemies and the restoration of public order have already become a reality. The only remaining task is how to develop the natural resources of this island, which ranks as the third largest in the world (Greenland is the largest, New Guinea is the second). Except for coastal shipping, there is virtually no waterway transportation between cities on the island. However, developing waterway transportation requires ships and takes time, so it is planned to first open air routes. Borneo has abundant oil reserves, and oil production will be increased to 2 million tons per year.

### Japanese Ambassador to the Holy See Arrives in the Vatican

Vatican City, 24th (Havas) – Ken Harada, the first Japanese ambassador to the Holy See, arrived here last night by train from Vichy with his wife. Many representatives from Japan and the Holy See, as well as Mr. Tadashi, counselor of the Japanese Embassy in Italy, Mr. Grano, representative of the Vatican Secretary of State, and Mr. Ferlatto, president of the Vatican University, welcomed them at the station. After the death of Japanese Ambassador to France Kato, Mr. Harada served as Chargé d'affaires in France until recently, when he took up the post of Ambassador to the Holy See. Currently, the number of foreign envoys to the Holy See has increased to 37, including 13 with the title of ambassador. At the same time, the Holy See has 36 envoys abroad, including 12 official diplomatic representatives and 23 religious representatives, without diplomatic status.

### Cuban Government Decides to Advise the Government

Berlin, 25th (Havas) – According to a dispatch from the German News Agency in Havana, the Cuban government has decided to advise Cuban expatriates in Europe to return home.

### German Military Opposes Chemical Warfare: Dangerous for Both Sides

Stockholm, 25th (Reuters) – Whether chemical warfare will be used in this war as it was in the last World War is being discussed by military experts in Berlin. As the summer war approaches, according to the Berlin correspondent of a local newspaper, the German military opposes the use of chemical warfare, and does not believe that the enemy will use it. The use of chemical warfare is dangerous for both sides. It is most suitable to use chemical warfare on the Eastern Front. In recent years, efforts have been made to find ways to defend against chemical warfare. German chemical factories have been working hard on this, so everything depends on whether the enemy uses chemical warfare. From their observation, the German side has an advantage, and it will be more dangerous for the enemy than in the last World War.

### Battle of Corregidor; Japanese Aircraft Attack Port Moresby

Schulp, 15th (Reuters) – The Southwest Pacific Allied Headquarters announced today that Japanese aircraft attacked Port Moresby, New Guinea, yesterday afternoon (Friday). There was artillery fire at the fortress of Corregidor in the Philippines, and Japanese aircraft also carried out air raids.

Berlin, 24th (Havas) – The Allied nations have decided to establish a "South Pacific Theater Headquarters," commanded by the U.S. Navy. Its jurisdiction includes New Zealand and other British territories in the South Pacific. A semi-official statement here yesterday criticized this, stating briefly that the life of the British Empire is now threatened, not only due to the victories of the Axis powers, but also due to its internal divisions. At the same time, certain political intentions of the United States are also a major reason. The British government's anxiety over these issues is no less than the frustration of repeated naval defeats.

Lisbon, 25th (Haitong) – According to The Times of London, the influence of the United States in Australia is increasing. Because the United States is geographically easier to assist Australia, but Britain developed Australia with capital and sold Australian products, while U.S. and Australian products are similar, making business difficult to develop.

### Pan-American Press Conference to Open Next Month

### Sweden Protests to Britain for Smuggling Weapons

Stockholm, 25th (Haitong) – The Swedish government has protested to London because Britain destroyed Swedish neutrality and smuggled machine guns into Sweden, placing them on Norwegian ships in Gothenburg. It is said that British diplomatic personnel in Gothenburg are also involved in this case. Yesterday, Swedish newspapers discussed this matter, advocating for a thorough investigation. "Swedish Evening News" claimed that the 20 machine guns were hidden in diplomatic baggage and transported to Sweden. This kind of abuse of diplomatic privilege and smuggling of weapons is a serious incident that destroys Swedish neutrality. The person in charge of this matter is said to be Sir Pinney, a second-class British commercial attaché, who travels frequently between London and Stockholm, carrying large amounts of luggage each time. Customs officials did not inspect his luggage because he was a diplomatic official. When the Gothenburg Norwegian ship was about to leave, he was on one of the ships, the "Dick To". However, after German patrol ships had sunk several Norwegian ships outside Swedish territory, the "Dick To" changed course and returned. These Norwegian ships all had two captains, one British and one Norwegian. After the "Dick To" returned, its captain was arrested for smuggling and illegally possessing weapons. The case is currently being thoroughly investigated by the court.

### British Parliament to Debate Indian Question

London, 25th (Reuters) – A Reuters political correspondent says the House of Lords and the House of Commons will debate the Cripps mission to India during the next consecutive session. Cripps will personally describe the process in the House of Commons. The Duke of Devonshire, Under-Secretary of State for India and Burma, and others will speak on behalf of the government in the House of Lords. The next time the two houses meet, the war will not be debated. It is requested that the Prime Minister continue to speak on the war based on the current situation.

### Establishment of a Consolidation Committee to Consolidate Public Bonds of Various Provinces; Lottery Draws on Schedule; Advance Disbursement of Principal and Interest; Decision to Cease Issuance of Unissued Remaining Bond Certificates

Chongqing, 25th (Telegram) – The Ministry of Finance has established a Consolidation Committee to consolidate public bonds of various provinces. After preliminary investigation and consolidation of materials, personnel have been dispatched to various provinces to receive all provincial public bonds that were legally issued and can continue to repay principal and interest. The Consolidation Committee will submit the principal and interest to the Ministry for approval before the due date and notify the National Treasury Administration to issue payment orders, which will be delivered to the local banks acting as the National Treasury for payment. Various provinces can hold lottery draws on schedule. The remaining unissued certificates that are still to be issued have been submitted to the Executive Yuan by the Ministry of Finance for approval, ordering all provinces to deliver them to the local banks acting as the National Treasury for safekeeping and to no longer issue them in order to reduce the burden on the people. The debts and rights constituted by the provincial public bonds, as well as matters concerning public bond funds or loan collateral, have been handled separately in accordance with the prescribed methods. Once the acceptance by the various provinces is completed, the Consolidation Committee will formulate a unified consolidation plan for implementation.

India Issue Special

### Eight. Indian Culture

In the movement led by Gandhi, in addition to the political goal of achieving autonomy by breaking away from British rule, there was also a cultural goal of eliminating foreign material civilization and returning to the original face of ancient India. This so-called original face of ancient India is none other than the Vedic culture of ancient India. From a nationalist standpoint, this argument is justified, but from the perspective of social evolution, it is highly debatable. For many years, the reason why India could not be built into a nation-state, and even became a colony, is that the social system built on the foundation of ancient Indian culture cannot but bear considerable responsibility. Gandhi once strongly opposed the evil custom of mistreating the "untouchable" class, and proved from the Vedic classics that this evil custom was groundless, but the budding of this class and the caste system was precisely based on the idea of the Aryan nation considering itself superior in the Rigveda (one of the four Vedas).

Analyzing the entire Indian culture, it is not difficult to find a major feature: its unusually strong religious nature. Therefore, some say: "The Indian nation is a nation that places its foundations on religion for thousands of years." In other words, "they live, work, eat, and speak with religion", and therefore "all Indian phenomena flow from the source of religious life and are nothing more than temples built on the foundation of religious life." Therefore, it is not that India does not have philosophy, literature, science, and art, but except for very few exceptions, they all have an inseparable connection with religion, and even exist for the sake of religion. Philosophy is a means of thinking to achieve religious goals, literature is used to explain or record religious sacred words, and astronomy, mathematics, phonology, grammar, etc., although they all had considerable development since ancient times, were only regarded as auxiliary knowledge of the Vedas. This universal permeation of religiosity not only hinders the progress of Indian society, but also hinders the normal development of various academic disciplines. Naturally, from another perspective, such a development of religiosity is precisely an inevitable reflection of the stagnant phenomenon of social production.

The issue of Indian religion is originally not within the scope of this article, but when it comes to cultural issues, it is necessary to briefly explain the religious characteristics. In India, whether it is religion or science, although there are many schools, there is only one ultimate goal: how to thoroughly solve the problem of life. In other words, how to rely on thinking to obtain an ideal basic tone of life, and the answer obtained is to seek liberation and Nirvana. From this point of view, rather than saying that Indian philosophy belongs to religion, it is better to consider philosophy as the foundation of Indian religion, with deep inner thinking as its basic element. Its analysis of subtle human details is unmatched by any other ideological system, and its ideological characteristics are the negation of the world and life.

In terms of chronological order: the Vedic era between 1,000 and 2,000 BC was the era of the birth of Indian culture. At that time, the Aryans had just entered the Indus River Plain in the guise of a cultural nation. Their social organization was patriarchal families and ethnic village communes ruled by tribal chiefs. Agriculture and animal husbandry were equally important, and religion was ancestor worship and nature worship. At this time, knowledge of astronomy was not very prominent, but medicine had considerable budding, but incantations still occupied the greatest influence, and music also developed to a considerable extent. By 1,600 BC, the era of the Brahmanas and Upanishads, the rituals of Brahmanism and the caste system were gradually established, and the Aryans began to establish national rule in the Ganges River basin, and production and division of labor gradually developed. Many narrative poems appeared in this era. The most famous, the Mahabharata, includes 200,000 verses and is the longest poem in the world, describing the war between the Kurus and the Pandavas, corresponding to Homer's Odyssey in Greece. At this time, Indian humanities had been established, and the calendar was also quite developed. By about 500 BC, the Aryans further developed to the southeast, and India gradually became unified. Whether it was political, literary, philosophical or artistic, it shone brightly, and teaching flourished. Eastern India produced Buddhism and its philosophy and literature, while northwestern India produced the famous doctrines of Jainism and the six schools of philosophy such as Yoga also arose at this time. In addition, many classics and books on phonology and literature dictionaries were compiled. Further into the Maurya Dynasty and the Gupta Dynasty, India reached its peak. It was also the golden age of Buddhism. Four assemblies before and after confirmed the Buddhist scriptures. Great masters such as Asvaghosa and Nagarjuna, and later Vasubandhu and Asanga, successively emerged, and philosophy and literature developed to their peak. At the same time, the style of Greek art, also infiltrated India from Central Asia and the Yuezhi people, mixing with the local sculptural skills and adding a unique color to Buddhist statues. This is the famous Gandhara art. To this day, there are still many Buddhist relics of this style in Afghanistan and Kashmir. In addition, Buddhist architecture also had good development. On the other hand, Brahmanism was biding its time and imitating the style of Buddhist scriptures to create the Laws of Manu. By the fourth and fifth centuries AD, Buddhism gradually declined, and Brahmanism revived by adopting Buddhist rituals, creating the Purana literature. These are some historical or doctrinal books, which are the most important classics of Hinduism since the Middle Ages. The existing Puranas are divided into two categories, large and small, with 18 types each, but in fact they are all works after the 10th century. In this era, Sanskrit academic literature flourished, including Kalidasa's poems and dramas and Aryabhata's astronomical works, which won praise from the world. The Buddhist master Asvaghosa was also an outstanding poet who wrote many poems and plays. But after the eighth century, Indian culture entered a dark age. As the Hui and Mongol peoples successively invaded, ancient Indian culture was destroyed. Only Hinduism and its system still maintained the legacy of ancient Indian culture under Islamic rule.

After Britain ruled India, although India produced outstanding poetess Faru Dntt and Tagore, although whether speaking from India or the whole of Asia, the greatness of these two poets is obvious to all, but it does not necessarily add more brilliance to the once glorious ancient Indian culture.

From this longitudinal description, it can be seen that the Indian Brahmanism originating from the Vedas has been the main pillar of Indian culture for 2,000 years. After many years of division and slavery, the Indian nation still maintains strong vitality. It cannot be denied that this is mainly the power of religion, but on the other hand, as its writers say: "The reason why Hinduism cannot build a country is that one kind of living structure it has built has nothing that is contrary to the elements of organizing a country. It imprisons people in countless separate circles, and teaches each to avoid eternal death through endless reincarnation life after life, binding them with strict rules in religious and social forms in each circle." This is precisely the fatal wound of the Indian nation.

### Atlantic Coast: Germany Claims Defense is Solid; Britain and the US Discuss Western European Warfare

Germany Border, Harty, 24th (Vas News Agency) - Regarding the British attack on northern France, the "Berliner Tageblatt" recently commented, stating that the German defenses along the French Channel and Atlantic coast are as solid as a fortress, nearly impregnable. Since the summer of 1940, the German army and navy have been using heavy artillery to prepare for any attack along the Channel and Atlantic coast. Since then, improvements have been repeatedly made, with heavy artillery units defending the coastal line, assisted by mobile medium artillery units. In addition, countless small and agile artillery units provide further protection. In fact, the entire coastal area has become a military defense zone, with infantry positions deployed. Furthermore, due to the extensive road network, mechanized units can freely maneuver along the coast. Air and sea patrol units are also under army command, patrolling day and night to prevent surprise attacks. In short, while certain "incidents" are highly possible, especially at night, with hundreds of British soldiers landing along the coast in small, agile boats, a large-scale landing at any point is ultimately impossible.

Stockholm, Sweden, 24th (Allied News Agency) - Since US Army Chief of Staff Marshall and Head of the Lend-Lease Program, Hopkins, jointly visited Britain, discussions have been rife regarding the establishment of a second European front, as rumored by the Allies. According to dispatches from London today, British Prime Minister Churchill declared, "He has already received a dispatch from the US President, fully agreeing with the issues determined during the previous meetings between Marshall, Hopkins, and British leaders." News circles here believe that the issues Churchill mentioned refer to the establishment of a second European front. However, British views on the second front vary. Some say that a landing in Europe will take place this summer. Therefore, many people believe that the recent British raids on the Norwegian coast and Saint-Nazaire, France, as well as the repeated large-scale air raids on German and French-occupied areas, may only be psychological warfare against Germany. To transport a modernly equipped army, a large number of ships are required. On average, each soldier requires at least six tons of shipping. By this calculation, transporting a division of troops would require 120,000 tons of shipping. To transport 1.5 million people across the English Channel would require approximately 9 million tons. It is not easy for Britain to concentrate such a large number of ships at present. Defending the British mainland already requires 3 million people. Moreover, the British army needs to deploy at least 1 million to 1.5 million troops to complete a large-scale landing operation in Europe, but where would Britain get so many troops? Even if the US troops stationed in Northern Ireland are included, it is still not enough. Therefore, Britain's last hope is to request Canadian troop assistance. However, Canada itself faces many difficulties. The German forces stationed in France and Norway are numerous, numbering between ten and fifteen divisions. In addition, there are airborne divisions, which are sufficient to prevent a British landing. After Germany appointed Marshal Rundstedt as Commander-in-Chief of German Forces in Western Europe, the German forces in Western Europe are not only not worried about insufficient defense, but also harbor offensive intentions, and an attack on the British Isles is quite possible.

Washington, 24th (Havas News Agency) - Military figures here claim that the talk of an Allied invasion of Europe is rampant, even among officials. In reality, this is difficult to achieve in the very short term. If the Allies do not gain a significant advantage in shipping and equipment, and train a large number of reserves, it will not be possible to launch an offensive. The immediate task of the democratic countries is to accelerate the construction of ships and military supplies for future military operations. At the same time, semi-official sources here insist that they have received "the most promising intelligence from Europe," but they remain tight-lipped about the nature of this intelligence.

Washington, 25th (Reuters) - British special envoy to the United States, Beaverbrook, gave a speech yesterday advocating the opening of a second front in Western Europe. Political circles in Washington are commenting on this today. Representative May, Chairman of the House Military Affairs Committee, stated that, considering this statement, coupled with the recent trip to London by US Army Chief of Staff General Marshall, it is clear that there will be war in Western Europe, and the sooner the better. Senator Taft stated that if the United States is ready, it should take the offensive.

Pound Discusses Naval Cooperation in the US

Stockholm, Sweden, 25th (Haitong News Agency) - According to news from here last night, military and political circles in Washington discussed the occupation of the French island of Madagascar. At the same time, First Sea Lord Admiral Pound visited the United States and discussed Anglo-American naval cooperation in invading continental Europe and repelling German submarines off the American Atlantic coast with the US Navy Department. Pound had a long talk with President Roosevelt on Thursday. When Pound left the White House, he said that Roosevelt was a great naval strategist.

Ottawa, 24th (Havas News Agency) - British Navy Commander-in-Chief Admiral Pound and Admiral Little arrived here today from Washington to prepare for a meeting with Canadian naval officers.

### Intense Local Fighting on Some Sections of the Eastern Front; Snow and Ice Melting Everywhere

German Supreme Headquarters, 25th (Haitong News Agency) - This afternoon's German war report stated that Soviet forces advancing in Eastern Europe were repelled, and our forces achieved a surprise victory. German aircraft bombed port facilities on the coast of the Caucasus and the Sea of Azov, and the Soviet rear was bombed. German fighter groups and destroyer groups shot down 18 Soviet aircraft, including 17 Hurricane aircraft. The day before, Italian aircraft attacked a Soviet airfield and destroyed nine aircraft parked on the ground.

Kuybyshev, 25th (Reuters) -

Spring has arrived, the sun is often seen, and snow and ice are rapidly melting everywhere. Major battles on the front are restricted by this, and it is expected to remain so for the next few weeks. However, local battles in some areas are extremely intense, as Soviet forces fight hard to seize better positions, and German forces launch rapid counterattacks. On the one hand, behind the German lines, guerrillas

Moscow, 25th (Reuters) - The Soviet Information Bureau's midday supplementary communiqué stated that German forces used flamethrowers on the western (central) front. It is reported that German infantry, using flamethrowers and assisted by aircraft, launched repeated attacks but were repelled. German counterattacks on the Kalinin front were also repelled by Soviet artillery. Soviet guerrillas were active in the Byelorussian region, attacking German food depots.

Vichy, 25th (Reuters) - According to reports from a Vichy newspaper correspondent from Tidanbo, on Thursday, about 20 miles north of Kursk, Soviet troops launched an extremely fierce offensive. Fierce fighting is currently taking place along the Kursk-Okhochevka road. Kursk is located on the railway line from Moscow via Orel to Kharkov.

London, 25th (Reuters) - According to news from Moscow today, Soviet forces are launching a fierce offensive against Finnish forces, and fierce fighting for an important high ground resulted in its capture by Soviet forces. The Red Army is also engaged in other local battles on the Finnish front, with considerable success.

Germany Transports Field Guns by Air

Stockholm, Sweden, 25th (Havas News Agency) - This week marks the 44th week of the German-Soviet war. The various fronts are relatively quiet. Military observers here believe that this is a temporary respite before the decisive battle. When the spring offensive is launched, the Red Army will have an advantage in manpower, while the German army will have an advantage in equipment. For example, the Soviet Union announces daily that large groups of soldiers are arriving at the front from Siberia, the Urals, and Central Asia. Germany, on the other hand, announces that the General Staff is using all its scientific and technical knowledge to solve transportation problems. The nature of transportation is extremely important, as the German army needs to transport a large number of military supplies to the front, including not only weapons and ammunition but also all supplies, so that the German army, when operating 800 to 1,000 miles from ordinary supply depots, will not be short of supplies. At the same time, air transport has also been expanded. According to German officials, the new aircraft at the front now transport not only soldiers, weapons, food, and ammunition, but also field guns, anti-aircraft guns, and even tractors and tanks.

London, 24th (Reuters) - Military commentators say that the Eastern Front war seems to be intensifying, but there are no large-scale battles. Soviet forces have made minor advances on the Yukhnov and Kalinin fronts, but without any victories. There is no sign of Germany's plans, and a large-scale offensive is also pending. Hitler may have decided to remain silent for the time being before the main force is deployed on the Eastern Front.

The State of the Soviet-Finnish War is Frightening

Milan, 25th (Havas News Agency) - The Evening Post's war correspondent on the Eastern Front recently reported on the fierce fighting between the Finnish and Soviet armies on both banks of the Svir River in the past month, which is quite alarming. It is said that when the Finnish General Staff announced that a Red Army division had been encircled and annihilated, foreign readers assumed that the Finnish army had mobilized at least two divisions to achieve this result. In reality, the Finnish units that annihilated the Red Army main force rarely exceeded three or four hundred men. These men, in groups of ten or twelve, formed patrol teams, nicknamed "pocket guerrilla teams," and annihilated the Red Army with ruthless methods. In addition, whenever the Red Army was encircled in bag-shaped positions, they often did not resist strongly, and even did not calculate the number of enemies or their positions, only hiding and using intense artillery fire to deal with the elusive Finnish guerrillas. Therefore, the annihilation of the Red Army was only a matter of time. They fell to the ground one by one, rarely surrendering. On the seventh day of the battle, two Red Army tanks suddenly overturned while crossing a swamp. In another battle area, a Red Army field artillery unit attempted to occupy a Finnish flank artillery position, but while rushing, it suddenly fell into a swamp. Horses and men overturned, with only the horses' heads visible above the mud. After a struggle, they finally drowned miserably. On both sides of Lake Onega, there were Siberian plainclothes troops who ventured to cross frozen swamps during an attack, but the ice suddenly broke midway, and the entire team fell into the swamp and died tragically. Such cases are numerous. The large losses of the Red Army were mostly like this.

Helsinki, 24th (Havas News Agency) - An official communiqué stated that the front is limited to small-scale activities. Our forces are currently conducting mopping-up operations near the Onas Isthmus. Flowers Donated from All Parts of France

### Pétain's Birthday: Flowers Donated from All Parts of France

Vichy, 25th (Havas News Agency) - Marshal Pétain celebrated his 86th birthday yesterday, conducting business as usual in his office without holding any birthday celebrations. The only difference was that the air was filled with flowers donated from all parts of the country. These flowers were often accompanied by sincere and touching eulogies. In addition, donations to the prisoner-of-war relief fund and the national relief fund were also very enthusiastic. As for the various territories, congratulatory telegrams poured in, reaffirming their support for the motherland and their affection for the Marshal.

### Cartagena Port Naval Shipyard: Spanish Government Allocates Funds for Repair

Madrid, 24th (Havas News Agency) - The government has recently allocated 3.6 million pesetas to the Navy for the repair of the Cartagena Port naval shipyard. The port is the most important naval port in Spain, and its shipyard was destroyed during the civil war in 1936.

### European Handicraft Representatives Hold Conference in Rome

Rome, 24th (Havas News Agency) - Prime Minister Mussolini met today with representatives of the International Association of European Handicrafts. The association recently held a conference in Rome, with representatives from Germany, Italy, Bulgaria, Finland, Hungary, and Spain participating.

### German Submarine Base Rostock Attacked; French, Dutch, and Danish Territories Also Bombed; German Aircraft Simultaneously Attack the British Coast

German Supreme Headquarters, 25th (Haitong News Agency) - A war report stated that German fighter groups shot down eight British aircraft off the English Channel coast yesterday. Our aircraft bombed armaments factories and supply facilities in southern England in retaliation for the British air raid on German cities. The city of Exeter in southern England was heavily bombed. Last night, British aircraft bombed residential areas in the city of Rostock, causing several civilian casualties and damage to houses. Two British aircraft were shot down.

London, 24th (Havas News Agency) - The Air Ministry recently issued a communiqué stating that a small squadron of British bombers, escorted by destroyer squadrons, flew to western Holland today to attack the Vlissingen naval shipyard and other military targets. Later, they flew to northern France and bombed German military targets, shooting down a total of five German aircraft. Britain also lost nine destroyers. The British Broadcasting Corporation also issued detailed news about the British air raid on the German port of Rostock. The port is a German submarine base, employing 8,000 workers in various jobs. At the same time, it is also a German railway hub, with the railway line between Berlin and Denmark passing through the port. Therefore, all military supplies for the German-Finnish forces in northern and eastern lines are transported via this route. Thus, the British air raid on the port of Rostock is of great importance.

Stockholm, Switzerland, 24th (Havas News Agency) - The Basler National-Zeitung's Berlin dispatch stated that an air raid alarm was issued in Berlin yesterday for the first time in five months. According to reliable sources, only one British aircraft passed through the area, presumably returning to its country after participating in a large-scale bombing raid on a city in northern Germany.

Copenhagen, 25th (Haitong News Agency) - In the past two nights, British aircraft groups have intruded into Danish airspace, and air raid alarms have been issued in Copenhagen and other cities. On Wednesday night, British aircraft did not drop any bombs. On Thursday night, one bomb was dropped in South Jutland, hitting a farm there and causing heavy damage. That night, one British bomber crashed and landed in Schleswig, the pilot was arrested by the police, and the aircraft was burned.

London, 24th (Havas News Agency) - An Air Security Department communiqué stated that German aircraft bombed various areas on our country's southwest coast yesterday, causing several civilian casualties and some material damage. Two German aircraft were shot down by us. Also, last night, German aircraft attacked several cities in our country's south, injuring three residents and killing five, and several houses were also destroyed.

### New Swiss Envoy to Germany

### British Political Parties Oppose Cabinet Ministers

Stockholm, Switzerland, 24th (Havas News Agency) - The Neue Zürcher Zeitung's London correspondent recently reported that although there is seemingly much understanding among British political parties, serious unrest is currently sweeping the country. Although the government has not encountered organized opposition, the House of Commons' by-elections often give independent candidates an opportunity to take advantage. These candidates advocate expanding war efforts and strengthening war command. These candidates support Prime Minister Churchill himself, but vehemently criticize his cabinet ministers. This situation can be seen in the recent election campaign in the Rugby constituency. The official Conservative candidate for that constituency is Holbrook, while his opponent is the independent candidate Brown. However, Brown's candidacy is opposed by the Labour Party and the Trades Union Congress. Therefore, the Labour Party Executive Committee issued a declaration, asking all voters to support Holbrook. However, Labour Party members in the Rugby constituency are deeply dissatisfied with this declaration. Therefore, the outcome of the by-election in that constituency has aroused great interest among London political circles. The London Evening Standard has made an interesting analysis of this situation, stating, "The value of old parliamentary politics has been completely destroyed. Candidates are no longer designated by political parties but by the voters themselves. In fact, it can be said that the various political parties have all passed away. Observe the irreconcilable differences between the young and conservative factions within the Conservative Party, and the irreconcilable differences between the supporters of Sir Cripps and those who advocate moderate socialism within the Labour Party."

### German Reichstag Reportedly to Convene; Hitler to Deliver Speech, Possibly Involving the French Question

### German Government Implements Income Tax to Replace Municipal Taxes

Berlin, 24th (Havas News Agency) - In order to simplify and unify the German tax system, the Ministry of Finance has recently ordered the cessation of the collection of all municipal taxes, replacing them with a uniform salary tax (income tax).

Berlin, 25th (Haitong News Agency) - The German Styrian Iron and Steel Association opened in Graz yesterday. German Economics Minister Funk gave a speech, stating that the new organization of German commerce would be of great help to the armaments industry, and that Germany's armaments production far exceeds that of its enemies.

Strict Punishment for Speculators

Stockholm, Switzerland, 24th (Havas News Agency) - The Basler Nachrichten's Berlin correspondent reports that the German government is now taking strict measures against speculators and people who violate purchasing restrictions in the country. For example, the manager of a factory in Braunschweig withheld 500 pounds of meat and 125 pounds of butter that were originally allocated to workers. After the authorities discovered this, he was immediately sentenced to death. His secretary was also sentenced to six years of exile for aiding and abetting the crime. Another industrialist falsely claimed that he bought a large quantity of leather for his own use, and then sold it to shoe manufacturers at a high price, making a large profit. After the authorities discovered this, he was immediately sentenced to death. The shoe manufacturers were sentenced to many years in prison as a warning.

### German Air Force Authorities Create New "Desert Rescue Patrol"; Naval Authorities Also Adopt Similar Measures

Berlin, 24th (Havas News Agency) - The German Air Force authorities have created a new type of "Desert Rescue Patrol," which appears on the Libyan front in North Africa with the German Air Force. This flying unit has special landing equipment and can land safely on the most rugged terrain. Its main task is to rescue German and Italian air force personnel who are stranded in the "no man's land" of the desert or behind British lines. The aircraft carries food and tents, so that in necessary, tents can be set up at the landing site to wait for support. Since the establishment of this rescue patrol, it is reported that more than 50 German and Italian air force personnel have been rescued. At the same time, naval authorities have also taken similar measures. Each water rescue aircraft, based on the Italian-owned island of Sicily in southern Italy, patrols the Mediterranean Sea, especially the waters near Malta, and has rescued more than 90 Axis and British air personnel.

### General Afukami Appointed Tehran Garrison Commander; New Iranian Railway Reaches Persian Gulf; Expansion of Wharf and Port Project to be Completed Soon

Istanbul, 25th (Haitong News Agency) - Reports received here state that General Afukami has been appointed as the Tehran Garrison Commander.

Tehran, 24th (Reuters) - With increased vehicles, adjusted personnel, and the cooperation of Iranian personnel at the railway bureau, the Iranian railway's transport volume has increased fivefold compared to August of last year. After the opening of the new railway line from Ahvaz (southwestern Iran) to Khorramshahr (at the northernmost end of the Persian Gulf), the Iranian railway can now directly reach Khorramshahr, the second largest port in the Persian Gulf, and Bandar Shahpur. Due to the increase in the volume of British and American supplies transported to the Soviet Union, there is a need to expand the wharf and port. This project will soon be completed. In addition, the section of the Indian railway from Naugaon to Zahedan (on the southeastern border of Iran) can be completed within a few months and will be an important route for British and American supplies to be transported to the Soviet Union via India. British and American supplies will first be transported to Karachi, and then transshipped via Meshed (on the northeastern border of Iran) to the Soviet Union.

### Banking Clearing House Association Restores Regular Clearing of Notes; All Shanghai Banks to Participate; Implementation to Begin on May 1

After the Banking Clearing House Association joined the foreign bank clearing group, the association has been acting as an agent for the clearing of notes receivable and payable between various contracted banks and foreign banks. Now, the committee has decided to restore the regular clearing of notes for various contracted banks. Staff from each bank will be assigned to handle regular clearing, which is the clearing method used when the clearing house was first established. Clearing will be temporarily conducted once a day, with the time being 3:30 pm. From then on, all banks in Shanghai that are members of the Bankers Association will participate uniformly. The association will arrange the numbers in order for clearing. Active preparations have been made, and it is reported that implementation will begin on May 1. All clearing methods will be handled in accordance with the regulations of the clearing house. Clearing banks that join will be called member banks, and the previous method of entrusting clearing will be abolished at the same time.

### Transfer of Rental Housing Licenses to be Discontinued Soon: Second Landlords Should Quickly Obtain Licenses

Since the Shanghai Municipal Council (工部局) began issuing licenses for subletting houses, over 20,000 have been issued up to yesterday. However, this number is still far from the number of anticipated licenses. It is apparent that many second landlords are deliberately evading and delaying the process. Apart from already dispatching personnel to first investigate the western district, they will then proceed to the central, northern, and eastern districts for further investigation to assess the situation. The deadline for issuing these licenses is set for the end of this month and will not be extended. Those who fail to obtain licenses by the deadline will face severe penalties.

### Shanghai-Ningbo Route: Shipping Unimpeded; Do Not Carry Excessive Items

The Changshan vessel of the East Asia Shipping Company set sail from the Taikoo Wharf for Ningbo at 5:00 PM on the 22nd of this month. Simultaneously, the Haiyong vessel also sailed to Ningbo with the Changshan on the same day. It is now known that the two vessels returned to Shanghai immediately after reaching Duobo and arrived back in Shanghai yesterday afternoon. This voyage is scheduled to depart today (the 26th), with the Changshan setting sail at 12:00 PM. The Haitong will still depart at the original time as it requires a smaller vessel to ferry passengers to the ship. The Wanji vessel has been out of service for a long time, and recently the authorities of the vessel announced its resumption. After returning to Shanghai last time, it remained docked at the Yangtse Wharf in Yangshupu. The vessel departed yesterday afternoon with approximately 300 tickets sold.

According to shipping industry sources, many passengers returning to Ningbo recently have been carrying daily necessities and fabrics. There are existing bans or quantity restrictions on carrying such goods. However, those returning to their hometowns are unaware and still carry them or carry them in excessive amounts. Inspections of these items are quite strict along the way. Once discovered, they will be confiscated. Those going to Ningbo should pay attention to this.

### Today is Sunday: Rice Warehouses Open for Rice Distribution

Yesterday, rice shops in both settlements extended the time for distributing rationed rice, and the purchasing and selling situation was quite widespread. The types of rice sold by rice shops yesterday included foreign rice, Wu rice, and foreign glutinous rice, depending on the rice warehouse. The Shanghai Municipal Council had previously stipulated that rice warehouses should be closed on Sundays. Starting today (Sunday), all warehouses have been permitted to open on Sundays to allow rice shops to collect rice. This ensures that the retail sale of rice on Mondays will not be affected by incomplete rice distribution. In the future, rice distribution will be permitted as usual every Sunday.

Tomorrow, Monday, rice shops will continue to collect corn subsidy vouchers from the Rice and Grain Management Committee and make payments to the Rice and Grain Office. From the next day, they will collect corn to be sold on Friday. The methods and procedures for selling will remain unchanged next week and will be handled as usual.

### Guangdong Fellow Provincial Association: Repatriating Fellow Provincials

The Guangdong Sojourners in Shanghai Association's committee for repatriating fellow provincials back to their hometowns has sent its first batch of fellow provincials back to Guangdong. Originally, there were 220 people, but many of the smallpox vaccination certificates of those returning home had expired or were insufficient, resulting in the shipping company temporarily rejecting tickets. Among them, the number of distressed sailors reached as many as 67. There were also many others who suspended their trips due to personal reasons or finishing up private matters in Shanghai. However, the association was able to complete the task of sending 154 people within a very short period of time. This group of repatriated personnel departed on the Tainan Maru for Guangdong on the 25th at 12:00 PM. The association, based on its aim of serving the hometown, dispatched personnel to escort them separately, fearing that fellow provincials would encounter various difficulties during the journey, and contacted the Guangdong-Shantou authorities and the association's liaison officer stationed in Guangdong-Shantou to properly take care of them. The association's handling of repatriation is so thorough and serves as an example. It is now reported that the association will handle the repatriation of a second batch of 400 people in mid-May, and has obtained assistance from the authorities to instruct the East Asia Shipping Company to undertake the transportation. Registration procedures will begin on May 1st.

### Over 8,000 British Nationals in Shanghai: Half Prepare to Evacuate; Those Residing for Generations Reluctant to Leave

The English-language "China Press" reports that, according to this newspaper's inquiries with authoritative British sources in Shanghai, it is estimated that about half of the over 8,000 British nationals in Shanghai have voluntarily registered for evacuation. Even if sufficient shipping convenience can be obtained, families that have resided in Shanghai for several generations would not suddenly evacuate this second hometown collectively. Those handling the registration stated that it is still too early to announce the most general number of registrants. However, after investigating opinions from all parties, it is generally believed that the evacuation of British nationals cannot be equated with the evacuation of American nationals (it is noted that all American nationals have registered to prepare for evacuation). There are two reasons for this. First, the number of American nationals is very small, and the total number of registrants, 1,250, includes all American nationals within the jurisdiction of the Shanghai American Consulate. Second, the foundation of British power in Shanghai is deeper. Most British families are now considering the difficult issue of whether to evacuate or not. According to unofficial opinions, British nationals are divided equally in their decisions to evacuate or not. It is expected that about half of the registrants will be willing to evacuate. Currently, the registration work is still being carried out at the Catholic Church on Jiangxi Road. The registration deadline was originally set for yesterday but has now been extended to Wednesday (the 29th).

### Tripartite Exchange of Nationals to be Held in East Africa: Location Selected as "Lourenço Marques"; British and American Nationals in Shanghai to Travel on Two Japanese Ships

The "Shanghai Times" reports that 227 British and American nationals arrived in Shanghai yesterday (the 23rd) from South China to await repatriation to their home countries in accordance with the exchange of nationals agreed upon by Japan and the United States and Britain. The group includes both diplomatic representatives and civilians. Diplomatic personnel are staying at the Cathay Hotel, while civilians are residing at the American School on Avenue Petain. It is noted that the Japanese side has agreed with the United States and Britain to repatriate approximately 1,000 British and American nationals on two Japanese mail ships, departing from Shanghai in late May for Lourenço Marques in Portuguese East Africa to exchange for Japanese diplomatic personnel and civilians. According to the repatriation plan, the majority of British and American nationals designated for repatriation are scheduled to gather in Shanghai, becoming the first batch of British and American nationals to be exchanged for Japanese nationals. Diplomatic personnel and ordinary civilians are both included in the repatriation list, but the scope of the operation will be limited by the capacity of the two Japanese mail ships.

### Landlord of Dalu Lane Disconnects Water Due to Rent Dispute

The landlord of No. 12, Dalu Lane, Luban Road, is Jiang Zhongjia from Pudong. Recently, citing the high cost of water bills, he demanded a 50% increase in rent. Since the outbreak of the war, the rent in this lane has been increased multiple times, with the difference compared to the original rent nearly doubling. The tenants in the lane feel that the burden is already heavy, and at this time of high living costs, how can they bear this heavy burden again? Although the houses at Nos. 28, 29, 30, and 31 are owned by another landlord, their style, size, and other aspects are similar to those in Dalu Lane, but the fees are lower. Jiang Zhongjia does not consider reducing the rent and, instead, increases the rent to coerce them. Disregarding public safety, he stopped supplying tap water to the front and back of the lane starting the day before yesterday. All the tenants panicked and, having no choice, requested relief from the police station and fire department. Meanwhile, they planned to hire lawyers Li Weibin and Zhang Yiping to file a lawsuit with the court. The letter to the police station and fire department is recorded as follows: "It is hereby investigated that Jiang Zhongji, the landlord of Dalu Lane, Luban Road, in the French Concession, has repeatedly increased the rent and made endless demands, exceeding the rent of similar houses in the same lane by a large amount. Recently, he cited the high cost of water bills and forced a 50% increase in rent. All the tenants are unable to bear it and requested that he withdraw the order, but he refused to meet. More recently, disregarding public safety, he rashly cut off the water supply, ignoring the lives of all the tenants, violating humanity, and defying the law. This is the worst case. Moreover, at this time, if a fire occurs, the harm is unimaginable. As it concerns public danger, we request your police station to quickly dispatch personnel to investigate and order Jiang Zhongji to restore the original state immediately to avoid accidents. Sincerely, etc."

### Embezzled 10,000 Yuan in Cash: Indecent Behavior in a Hotel Room; Arrested in Hotel

Yu Xianrong, the owner of Zhen Mianhang at No. 407, 260 Edward Road, instructed his apprentice, Yang Zengyuan (18 years old), a Shanghai native, and two others at 10:00 AM the day before yesterday to cash a 30,000-yuan check at the Japanese Mitsubishi Bank on Jiujiang Road. After obtaining the cash, each of the three hid 10,000 yuan and took three rickshaws separately. However, when the rickshaws arrived at the entrance of the business, the other two took the cash and entered, while Yang, on the pretext of paying the rickshaw fare, absconded with the 10,000 yuan in legal tender he had hidden.

Yu Xianrong reported this to the Central Police Station, and Chinese Detective Zhang Xiaolin began the investigation. He learned that Yang had engaged a victory escort agency girl named Chahua Queen to keep him company in a room at the Huizhong Hotel the previous day. Based on this clue, he continued the investigation. Until 3:00 AM yesterday morning, he received a report that the escort girl had been hired to room 607 of the China Hotel on Guizhou Road. However, the name of the person who hired her was unknown. Detective Zhang went to investigate the room on the pretext of checking it. As expected, he found Yang and four young men sleeping in one room with the escort girl.

Yang and the four young men, Song Jiaqi (23 years old), Yao Kunzhi (17 years old), a Shanghai native, Luo Dingshan (21 years old), a Zhenjiang native, and Wu Zhixiang (19 years old), were arrested. The original stolen money of 7,815 yuan was recovered and taken to the police station along with the people. It was discovered that Yang and others had already purchased boat tickets and were scheduled to leave Shanghai yesterday afternoon. If this case could not be apprehended quickly, there would be no hope of arresting them. They are now being held for investigation and further review.

### Temporary Relief Center in Putuo Road Police District Closes

Within a few days, the temporary relief center in the Putuo Road district received relief donations from enthusiastic people from all walks of life, totaling 135 people, raising 21,752.30 yuan in relief funds. It is especially commendable that Liu, Chen, Li, and Leng from the Central District raised nearly 10,000 yuan in donations. Eight people donated relief rice, totaling 14 bags of foreign rice, weighing 2,996.5 jin in total. One person also donated firewood, weighing 4 dan. The relief was distributed in the form of pancakes and porridge. After 14 days of emergency relief, approximately 20,000 poor people benefited. The cost of purchasing relief supplies totaled 7,377.83 yuan. On March 19, when the authorities opened the area, the board of directors decided through public discussion to temporarily end the distribution of relief supplies. It was found that the materials in stock included 212 jin of mung bean flour and 14 jin and 4 liang of broken rice. 5 jin and 4 liang of corn flour were all allocated to the Salvation Army branch on Macau Road in the Putuo Road district for distribution. 13 bags of relief rice (weighing 1,640 jin) were temporarily preserved and the method of handling them will be discussed again after six months. The remaining cash of 14,378.70 yuan was decided by the board of directors to send two distribution teams to investigate hidden poverty in the district. After two weeks of detailed investigation, 998 people received relief funds, totaling 10,264 yuan, which was distributed in full at the Jade Buddha Temple on April 16. After deducting the hidden poverty relief funds, the remaining cash of 4,111.47 yuan was decided by the fifth and sixth board meetings on the 22nd of this month to allocate it in full to charitable organizations in Shanghai, totaling five places. 1,000 yuan was sent to the Labor Hospital (inside Shoumin Hospital at the intersection of Xiaoshadu Road and Binlang Road), 1,000 yuan to Pushen Villa, 1,000 yuan to Renji Orphanage, 1,000 yuan to Jingye Orphanage and Education Institute, and 111.47 yuan in porridge tickets to the Buddhist Benevolence Hall. All of these were personally delivered by personnel sent by the office with a letter on the 24th (the day before yesterday). After all the account books of each team have been completed, accountant Li Wenjie will be invited to audit and certify them, and a report on the emergency relief will be issued and sent to enthusiastic donors from all walks of life, to show credibility.

### French Hygiene Department Urges Residents to Pay Attention to Food Hygiene: Food Must Be Fresh, Cooked Thoroughly, and Not Contaminated; Also, Eliminate Flies and Get Vaccinated

The English-language "Shanghai Times" reports that the Hygiene Department of the French Municipal Council issued a special notice yesterday, urging Shanghai residents to pay attention to the importance of the epidemic prevention movement in Shanghai, and solemnly stated the necessity of paying attention to diet and vaccination. Western medicines manufactured abroad are no longer being imported, and most treatments cannot be implemented. Therefore, infectious diseases may increase this summer, especially digestive tract diseases such as dysentery, typhoid fever, and cholera. Affected by the lack of coal, ordinary Chinese residents may not be able to cook food thoroughly, failing to kill dangerous germs. Therefore, residents must strictly abide by the rules of food hygiene. Food must be eaten fresh. If it has been stored for a long time and starts to ferment, eating it will introduce microorganisms or microbial toxins into the body's organs. Food must also be cooked properly, as cooking also has a sterilizing effect. Raw vegetables and fruits must be disinfected before being eaten raw. Food should also avoid contact with external contaminants. Most cholera, dysentery, and typhoid fever cases are caused by fly transmission. The elimination of flies should involve thoroughly cleaning houses and their surroundings to prevent their breeding. The notice continued, "Implementing food hygiene must fundamentally protect the digestive organs. Eating a lot of frozen drinks has a direct adverse effect on the stomach, resulting in frequent diarrhea and weakness in the summer." The notice concluded that every resident must use all the conveniences available in Shanghai to prevent the occurrence of cholera and typhoid fever. The main preventive method is vaccination to kill pathogens transmitted by microorganisms in the body. The Hygiene Department of the French Municipal Council is currently holding free vaccinations at No. 630, Avenue Bellesort. At the same time, the Hygiene Department of the Public Settlement and its sub-offices are also providing free vaccinations.

Unsuspecting people have suffered countless losses. There have also been cases of people jumping into the river because all their travel expenses and clothes were stolen. If these people are not eliminated, the victims will suffer even more.

The calculation method will be stipulated according to a ratio of 24.30 military scrip to 100 reserve coupons. However, it may vary slightly depending on the circumstances at the time of payment. According to an official spokesman of the Shanghai Municipal Council yesterday morning, "This measure does not mean a 30% salary increase for Japanese employees. Its purpose is to adjust their living conditions, as their main expenses must be paid in military scrip. After the salary is changed to military scrip, there will be little difference between them and other employees who are not paid in military scrip." There are no plans to change the salaries of non-Japanese employees of the Shanghai Municipal Council.

### Meng Xian Cup Basketball Tournament Closes: China South Wins Strong Star Championship; Thirty to Nineteen, Thirteen Each in First Half

The first Meng Xian Cup basketball tournament has been declared closed. China South defeated Strong Star thirty to nineteen to win the championship. The game was held at 3:00 PM yesterday at the Guoliang Middle School court on Avenue Edward VII. The crowd was packed. Strong Star's Gao Xilin scored first, and Huang Peijun added seven points. China South was unwilling to fall behind. After three and a half rounds, the game became tense. Strong Star's Huang Peijun scored two out of two, making it thirteen to eleven. China South rose up and pursued strongly. Zhang Daisong sent charcoal in the snow, and the first half ended in a thirteen-point tie. In the renewed battle, Strong Star's little Huang Gao Xilin took advantage of the situation and scored, taking the lead with nineteen to thirteen. This was the heyday of Strong Star. At this time, it was raining heavily, but the game continued. China South's ball luck also improved. Liu Fuqiang and Fuji desperately attacked, and every shot was successful, instantly adding twelve points. Strong Star lost its momentum. When the allotted time was up, China South defeated Strong Star thirty to nineteen to win the championship. After the game, Chairman Wang Ruilong of the school board presented the awards and closed the tournament.

### Davis Cup Player Cai Huiquan to India

Chinese Davis Cup tennis player Cai Huiquan, is reportedly about to go to India to perform and compete with Indian Davis Cup players. It is said that Cai is currently performing in Chongqing.

### Light Horse-drawn Carriage

Since buses have disappeared from the roads (referring to the Public Concession) and the number of private cars has decreased, horse-drawn carriages and bicycles have emerged in response. Horse-drawn carriages in Shanghai were almost eliminated during the era of popular automobiles. Apart from money brokers sitting in open carriages and speeding on the roads, horse-drawn carriages had very few uses. Due to the strict restrictions on gasoline rationing, the car-owning class, who used to flaunt their four-wheeled vehicles, had to make other plans. Naturally, horse-drawn carriages took their place. Horse-drawn carriages traditionally have four wheels as standard. Old-fashioned carriages resembled rickshaws in that the wheels were made of wood inlaid with iron, which made a lot of noise on the road and was quite annoying. Although rubber was later used, it was still solid, and the word "comfortable" did not apply. Only the two-wheeled light horse-drawn carriage shown in the picture, equipped with automobile steel wire inflatable tires, can be called comfortable.

Special Report from This Newspaper

### Darling of the Times: The Rise of the Bicycle (Part 2) - All Sorts Become Popular for a Time

### Greedy Car Dealers

Those who do not have bicycles are envious when they see others "riding swiftly and conveniently," and hope to buy one themselves, but they often do not think about the various troubles of bicycle owners. Let's talk about buying a bicycle. In recent months, due to the sudden increase in demand from citizens, bicycle prices have also taken the opportunity to "skyrocket." It is not uncommon for prices to rise several times a day, and bicycle prices are now so expensive that ordinary citizens cannot afford them. A decent used bicycle costs nearly a thousand yuan, while new bicycles are even more expensive. The worst ones sell for one or two thousand yuan, and exquisite racing bikes cost as much as seven or eight thousand yuan, which is not much different from the price of a car in the past. Although it is said that raw materials for making bicycles are difficult to obtain now, insiders say that such high bicycle prices are due to the greed of the car dealers.

### Considerable License Fees

Next is the issue of bicycle licenses. In the past, the license fee was only a few yuan per quarter, which was a very small amount. However, now things are different. After automobiles have almost disappeared, the concession authorities have suffered a huge impact on license fee revenue. They have to make plans for bicycle owners, raising bicycle licenses to tens of yuan to make up for the loss of automobile license fees. Moreover, if a bicycle is driven to the western district, another license must be paid, which further increases the burden on bicycle owners. It has recently been rumored that the concession and the western district have negotiated a joint license for both districts, but there has been no news so far. Even if the negotiations are successful and a joint license is issued, the new license fee will inevitably be higher.

### Beware of Being Cheated When Repairing Bicycles

Again, there is the issue of repair and lubrication. No matter how sturdy a bicycle is, parts will inevitably be damaged or need lubrication, so it must be sent to a repair shop. The cost has also risen with the price of bicycles, which goes without saying. The most hateful thing is that some repair shops, whenever a good bicycle is entrusted to them for repair, remove the valuable parts and replace them with inferior ones. The customer is deceived and does not notice it. Inferior parts are ultimately not durable. After a few days, the weaknesses are revealed. The area that was just repaired is damaged again, so you have to consult the repair shop often. Unexpected expenses are a minor matter, but a good bicycle is thus riddled with injuries, and there is really no place to complain.

### Theft is Also Very Common

Owning a bicycle has other troubles. For example, if you have to stay in a place for a long time, finding a suitable place to park your bicycle is indeed a major problem. In general, bicycles can only be parked on the outdoor sidewalk. Even if it is locked, it is still very easy to steal. The bell cover and lights often disappear, and even the bicycle itself disappears without a trace. If you don't want to admit bad luck and report it to the police station for investigation, you don't know when the item will be returned to its owner. Or, if you drive a bicycle to a building to work or visit friends, and you have to go straight to the upper floors of the building, then a difficult problem arises again. If you leave the bicycle in front of the building, you will be worried. If you carry the bicycle upstairs, you will be sweating after only running two or three floors, let alone running ten or eight floors. At this time, you will definitely complain and deeply regret not walking without any burdens. Fortunately, the elevator in this building is still open, so you can carry the bicycle up with the elevator, but it also hinders other passengers. At this time, even if you are not driven out, you will definitely be glared at. It has recently been rumored that a Chinese technician in this city has designed a lightweight bicycle that can be folded up when necessary and carried around. It does not take up space when parked, which is a great contribution, but it has not yet been seen on the market.

### The Rise of Bicycle Parking Racks

Speaking of the problem of parking bicycles, the French Concession authorities have installed wooden parking racks on several important roads within the concession, but unfortunately, the number is limited and it seems that they need to be installed more widely to be sufficient. These parking stations were initially managed by a Chinese policeman dispatched by the French police station, but later transferred to private operation. They are open from about 7:00 every morning until about 10:00 in the evening, after all the entertainment venues have closed. The fee for parking a bicycle for less than one hour is 20 cents, one hour is 30 cents, one and a half hours is 40 cents, and two hours is 50 cents. After more than two hours, an additional 20 cents is charged. If the bicycle is not picked up after six hours of parking, it will be sent to the nearest police station for collection. If calculated on a monthly basis, a monthly parking pass can be obtained, and bicycles can be parked at any parking station in the French Concession with the pass. This method does make it much more convenient for those who own bicycles. As for the Public Concession, such parking stations are still rare. Only some gas stations of the former oil companies now provide bicycle parking services, and the fees are very low. Some gas stations also provide cleaning and lubrication services for bicycles, with a monthly fee of about fifteen yuan.

### Women Change to Western Suits

Men do not have any problems with their clothing when riding bicycles, but women have two more troubles. With the sudden rise of bicycles in this city, Western-style trousers for women are popular. Foreign women took the lead in advocating them. Their intention is obvious. Originally, when wearing a short skirt to ride a bicycle, a gust of wind would often blow the skirt up, exposing the thighs and allowing passers-by to feast their eyes. This always made them feel uncomfortable unless their legs were covered up. This trend spread very quickly. Some women only know how to love fashion and do not even know how to ride a bicycle, but they also wear these Western-style trousers, strutting around the city, which looks very unsightly. Women who really use bicycles as transportation rarely change to long trousers. Most of them still wear cheongsams, and would rather pull the cheongsam corners from time to time to avoid exposing their legs. For example, when going to a banquet or visiting guests, it is inconvenient to drive a bicycle if the clothes are neat and tidy, especially for foreign women. If wearing a formal dress with a long skirt that drags on the ground, it is even more impossible to ride a bicycle, so they have to hire a horse-drawn carriage or rickshaw instead.

### Also a Way to Exercise

In this time when cars are scarce, bicycles are ultimately the darling of commoners. The troubles mentioned above are not difficult to solve. If you have sufficient financial resources, you can buy a bicycle, which is not only convenient for transportation, but also a way to exercise. Compared to pedestrians plodding along the sidewalk, it is ten times better. Long live bicycles! (Min)

### Shuang Ma Factory Orders Few Carts Released, Spot Yarn Price Decline Increasing Severely

### Longan (5)

— Gao Jiannong

Regarding the function of longan, what Song Jue said has already been mentioned above. The "Qun Fang Pu" and Li Shizhen's "Compendium of Materia Medica" say: "...Pacifies the mind and strengthens the spleen, nourishes weakness and improves appetite,...Long-term consumption makes one light and not old, and benefits intelligence, hence it is called 'Yizhi'. ...Among foods, lychee is the most valuable, but longan is the best for nourishment: This is because lychee is hot in nature, while longan is mild." Xu Yuanhu's "Complete Book of Agricultural Administration" also says: "Dried longan pulp is better than lychee, and can nourish the heart's qi, greatly benefiting people!" However, the Chinese belief that longan can benefit people and regard it as a tonic is entirely based on years of experience; although this cannot be said to be unreliable, we only know that it is so without knowing why. I think it is still necessary for chemists to verify it chemically, analyze its components one by one, and then we can obtain a scientific basis. Most of our Chinese "traditional medicines" lack this procedure. This is not very difficult, and I hope pharmacologists will implement it as soon as possible. (The editor also suspects that longan has the effect of strengthening the heart and refreshing the mind.)

There are three ways to propagate longan trees: sowing seeds, grafting, and air layering. Seedlings grown from seeds grow very slowly, taking fifteen years or more to bear fruit, and the fruits are small and the pulp is thin, of poor quality, so they must be improved by skillful artificial means, that is, grafting. The grafting method is described in detail in the book "Min Xiao Ji" by Zhou Lianggong of the Qing Dynasty: "Go to Min and graft twenty miles southeast, where there are many longan trees. Those grafted two or three times are called 'Ding Yuan'. The seeds initially sown take fifteen years to bear fruit, and the fruits are very small, commonly called 'Pepper Eyes'--another special name besides 'Human Eyes' and 'Ghost Eyes'--Find someone skilled in grafting to saw half of the wood and graft the young branches of large fruits onto it; after four or five years, saw half of it again and graft it as before: If this is done three or four times, the fruits will be abundant, doubling the ordinary variety. If it is stopped after one or two grafts, the shape will be small and the taste will be thin, not worth valuing. Those grafted three times are called 'Needle Trees', and those not grafted are called 'Wild...'." As for layering, it is a common method of propagating plants, but ordinary layering, such as grapes and pomegranates, always selects branches close to the ground, buries them underground, waits for them to grow roots, and then cuts them off from the mother plant. However, the layering of longan—and lychee—is not done on the ground, but high in the "air": This fanciful method, which the French natural scientist Coutiere called the original creation of the Chinese, is indeed worthy of praise! This method involves selecting a suitable branch on an old and good mother tree, and making a circular bark removal at the place where it is intended to be cut off, about six or seven points wide is enough. After peeling, use greasy soil mixed with shredded straw (?) to protect and stick it around, and then tightly tie it with stack leaves and aquatic plants on the outside. It is best to tie split coarse bamboo tubes or earthenware pots on the outside, like a flower pot for planting flowers. After that, water it regularly, and when it has grown tender white fine roots, saw it off and cultivate it. (To be continued)

### Current Priorities in the Family: Disease Prevention First

— Hua

In this day and age, medical expenses are so expensive that getting sick is the most terrible thing. Therefore, disease prevention work can really be said to be one of the current urgent tasks in the family.

Now is the time for vaccination and inoculation, and there are also places where it can be done for free. It is really possible to mobilize the whole family and jointly implement this disease prevention step. Here are also five principles for maintaining health. Please pay attention to them, housewives:

1.  Everyone should have a physical examination once a year, preferably by the doctor who examined their body last year, because he knows the past condition of your body.

2.  Implement possible prevention (i.e., vaccination and inoculation as mentioned above).

3.  If there is an abnormal condition in the body, immediately consult a doctor. The so-called abnormal conditions can be divided into the following types: (A) Feeling tired and weak in the morning after a night of restful sleep. (B) Being easily irritated and developing a neurotic state, because this may be a harbinger of typhoid fever and lung disease. (C) Sudden increase or decrease in weight. (D) Decreased appetite. (E) Abdominal pain. (F) Occasional fainting. (G) Excessive bleeding from the nasal cavity. (H) Increased body temperature at a fixed time every day. (I) Long-term loss of voice. (J) Headache. (K) Abnormal skin conditions. (L) Chest protrusion.

4.  Many people are unwilling to consult a doctor even when they are ill, because they are afraid of hearing bad news, but they are very worried in their hearts. This kind of inertia should absolutely be avoided, because worry is harmful to the body.

5.  A normal life is the best way to maintain health. If you can engage in proper recreation in your spare time, and go to bed early and wake up early, get more sunlight, and often take walks, you can at least prevent disease.

6.  Don't worry too much about your health. Many people often have hypochondria. In fact, as long as you make every effort to use the progress of science to protect the health of your body, excessive worry is not necessary in fact.

### Don't Marry a Beauty!

— Chen Zhongcheng

"Never marry a beautiful woman!" This is the advice that H.G. Wells gives us. Wells, who lived to the age of seventy-five, was a British novelist and scientist of global renown.

He believes that once a simple and unadorned woman becomes your wife, she will give you lifelong satisfaction, because she possesses a hidden and unobtrusive beauty, which is an inexhaustible source, supplying you with endless joy and comfort.

He also said: "A beautiful woman will bewitch you, intoxicate you, marry you, and give you moments of ecstasy. But others envy you and keep envying you." "After a while, you yourself become jealous of 'you'—jealous of the you of yesterday. By that I mean that certain flaws (flaws are inevitable in this world) are revealed to you. So her flaws become almost your own possession. This, on the other hand, tells you why no beauty is still beautiful in the eyes of her husband. As for the simple woman, it's completely different: Sooner or later you'll discover that she's full of little beauties, like beautiful pieces of music. For example, in her smile you'll discover the beauty of shyness, in her hair you'll discover beautiful waves, and so on, all the things you wouldn't have noticed when you first met her. All the beauties in the world are there for everyone to enjoy, but only your wife's simple beauty is your own treasure, the safest treasure."

He does not approve of marrying too young a woman as a wife. "Marriage is considered the most foolish deal, in which a man has to support another man's daughter. If you marry too young a woman as a wife, in addition to supporting her, you also have to complete her education. Why bother?"

He also pointed out the ideal wife: "A frivolous young man needs the advice of an experienced person, so if you don't hold on to bachelorhood, you have to marry a woman who is older than you. I have been working on this topic for some time, and after years of careful observation, the most ideal wife is undoubtedly a widow who has suffered misfortune."

Based on the sum of his experiences and observations, Wells succinctly laid down a "standard for choosing a wife": "Your wife must be simple and ugly (you have to try your best to get the ugliest), must be older (the same age as you or older than you), does not like to be in the limelight in society, and is poorer than you. The latter, in particular, can enhance your self-esteem."

You may not believe Wells's views, but the views of this world-renowned thinker and opponent of traditional beliefs are indeed of reference value.

### Common Sense for the Home

— Yi

A wooden bucket for holding water, if it cracks, it is more durable to use a mixture of clay and lime to fill the cracks than to use putty.

A new bowl should be boiled in water before it is used. If it is boiled two or three times in a soup for boiling meat, it can last for a long time and will not crack.

Sometimes it is difficult to quickly remove stains on a washbasin. If you scrub it with salt, the stains can be wiped away immediately.

If woolen clothing is sprayed with pepper water on the reverse side before tailoring, or wiped with raw taro, the finished clothing will never be moth-eaten.

Knives that have cut onions or garlic often retain a bad smell that is not easy to wash away. If you insert the knife into the soil for a few minutes, then pull it out and wash it clean, the bad smell will disappear.

### Weekly Home Cooking Menu

— Ms. Hua Ying

New broad beans are already on the market, but the prices demanded by vendors are so high that they are alarming. How much do you think they want? They ask for two yuan per pound, and they won't even consider an offer of one yuan. The high price is imaginable. In fact, after peeling off the shells, one pound of beans only fills half a bowl after cooking. It's hardly worth eating, and it's fine not to eat them. Moreover, the new beans are too small and too tender, with a slightly astringent taste, and there is nothing particularly delicious about them. Why not wait until they are a little older, when the price may be cheaper, and then indulge to your heart's content? But if you don't care about the high price and just want to try something new, stir-frying them with lettuce leaves is guaranteed to taste better than simply stir-frying broad beans.

### Talking About Cold Water Baths

— Er Wu

In these times of severe coal shortages, hot water has become quite precious! In the past, to take a bath only cost a few cents, and a trip to the bathhouse would guarantee you a comfortable wash and return home. But now, the average middle and lower classes dare not even ask about bathhouses! But watching your body get dirtier day by day is not a pleasant thing. What's more, it also poses a great threat to health.

Spring is about to pass, and summer is just around the corner. The weather is getting hotter day by day! Therefore, we are raising the call for "cold water baths." Many people, upon hearing the term "cold water bath," immediately think of immersing their bodies in cold water during the snowy winter season. As a result, they are half-frightened, thinking that they are playing with their lives. In fact, this is the inevitable result of imagination and lack of experience. The reality is not like that. Let me explain slowly, anyway, you don't immediately want to go and take a "cold water bath."

Now, let's first talk about how to take a "cold water bath." We know that no matter what we do, if we do it blindly and randomly, it will often lead to serious consequences. The same is true for "cold water baths." If you wash without common sense and catch a cold, the lighter consequences are slight discomfort; the heavier consequences are a serious illness that greatly damages your vitality. Wouldn't that be a great injustice?

After all that talk, I still haven't said how to wash. Okay, let's get back to the point.

First, you need to be warm. This doesn't mean the water needs to be warm, but your body needs to be warm. Of course, you won't feel cold at all in the summer, but in the winter, you have to do some exercise or stretching before taking a bath until your body feels slightly warm. You mustn't be covered in sweat, because that will damage your body. As for if you have any illnesses, you must never take a "cold water bath."

Second, you need to be quick. You must act quickly, first wetting your limbs and then the rest of your body. Rub vigorously with soap, then quickly rinse with water. It is best to complete all of this within five minutes. You must not take too long. You must not indulge in reading the newspaper in the bathtub in the summer for a moment of comfort, or even doze off.

Third, you need to be dry. After washing, dry yourself with a coarse towel (the coarser, the better), and then rub vigorously until your whole body turns red.

The bathing process is now complete. It is best to put on clothes and lie down for a while. At that time, a kind of indescribable comfort is to be expected. If you can take off your clothes in the sunlight and do a little sunbathing, it will be even better.

That way, starting in the summer, if you continue to take "cold water baths" intermittently, even in the harsh winter, you will be able to calmly cope with the cold for a moment without fear!

As for the benefits of "cold water baths," the most important thing is that they can directly give us a clean, healthy body. Indirectly, they also enhance our resistance to disease. At the same time, they also give us a vigorous, forward-looking spirit, and the accompanying pleasant and joyful emotions. Friends, with such abundant rewards, why wouldn't we do it?
