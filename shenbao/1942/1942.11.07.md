### Valiant Fighting of German Troops in North Africa: Entire Division Defends New Positions; Trench Warfare to Transform into Mobile Warfare; Capture of General Thomale Confirmed

Allied News Agency, Bern, 5th: According to news received here today, the German-Italian Allied forces on the Egyptian front completely retreated en masse on Wednesday morning, with no loss of troops or materiel. The success of this strategic maneuver was due to two actions: First, when General Thomale's German-Italian forces on the line were running out of ammunition and reinforcements, he personally led a small number of tanks into the enemy lines, engaging a large number of British heavy tanks for several hours. This provided cover for the larger German-Italian forces to retreat in an orderly manner to new positions. As a result, General Thomale was captured, a fact confirmed by the Berlin authorities. The other reason was the heroic defense of a battalion of infantry led by Captain Han Yunte in the south. Despite repeated fierce attacks by the British forces, they were unable to shake the position. Only after the main force of the German-Italian Allied forces had completed the strategic retreat did the battalion fight hard and retreat to the new German defensive line.

Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 6th: Responsible persons here confirm that General Thomale has been captured by British forces. According to information here, the British forces on the North African front used tanks to attack the German positions in sections. In one section, the British forces deployed more than a hundred heavy tanks. In order to repel the enemy forces, General Thomale personally went to the front line to fight, leading the charge with great bravery. General Thomale's tank became stuck in the enemy阵, and he was captured by the British forces. However, the German tank force still managed to repel the enemy tanks.

Havas News Agency, Berlin, 6th: The authorities here announced today that Tank Corps Commander General Stumme died in action on the Egyptian front on the 24th of last month.

Havas News Agency, Berlin, 6th: The German High Command announced this morning that the German-Italian Allied forces attacked the enemy tank forces between Fuka and Mersa Matruh. The fighting continued until last night, with increasing intensity. The enemy forces continued to increase pressure.

Haitong News Agency, Rome, 6th: Military figures in Rome believe that the planned withdrawal of the Axis forces in North Africa is a transition from trench warfare to mobile warfare. Rommel is a genius of mobile warfare, and further amazing performances can be expected in the future.

Havas News Agency, Berlin, 5th: The authorities here announced that fierce fighting is still underway on the Egyptian front. The enemy forces are launching a general offensive, and our forces are also putting up a strong defense. In some locations, our forces have retreated to the second pre-planned defensive line. Yesterday, Axis aircraft constantly bombed British armored forces and artillery positions. On the 3rd and 4th of this month, German-Italian aircraft shot down a total of 30 British aircraft, while 4 of our aircraft did not return to base.

### Lieutenant Colonel Yokoyama Discusses the German-Soviet War Situation, Criticizes American Propaganda

Allied News Agency, Local Dispatch: When meeting with reporters, Lieutenant Colonel Yokoyama stated that he believes the German forces now have ample experience to cope with the difficulties of winter warfare. Even if the severe cold arrives early this year as it did last year, it will not be an obstacle. It is heard that the arrival of the severe winter last year was four months earlier than in previous years, causing the German forces to suffer greatly from the extreme cold. However, it is now heard that the German forces have increased their effectiveness in preparation for winter warfare, and the reorganization and reconstruction work in the German-occupied areas has also made significant progress. The spokesman recounted his experiences serving in northern Manchuria to demonstrate the difficulty of winter operations. It is said that the ground in northern Manchuria freezes to a depth of two meters in winter, so trenches cannot be dug if the severe cold arrives earlier than usual. At the time of the outbreak of the Manchurian Incident, Japanese soldiers still lacked sufficient winter warfare experience, resulting in many cases of frostbite due to the extreme cold. According to reports from the military attaché of the Japanese Embassy in Berlin, the reconstruction work in the German-occupied areas "is currently being carried out effectively." It is said that every time the German forces occupy an area, its factories immediately resume operation.

Allied News Agency, Local Dispatch: Lieutenant Colonel Yokoyama continued, saying that the United States, in an attempt to divert the attention of the Chinese people from the heavy losses suffered by the American fleet in the East Asian waters and the Pacific Ocean due to Japanese attacks, has been talking about vague possibilities for the future. The spokesman criticized the recent trend of enemy propaganda, saying that the more setbacks the United States suffers, the more substance its propaganda lacks. This is quite evident. The spokesman cited several examples of such enemy propaganda to prove his point, saying that the announcement made in San Francisco on October 10 regarding the United States' intention to abolish extraterritoriality in China is merely a "check that cannot be cashed when it is due." Regarding this point, the Chinese people should remember that the American Chinese Exclusion Act has not been repealed by the US government. The United States' claim to supply Chongqing with military equipment and weapons has not yet materialized, which is another example of the emptiness of enemy propaganda.

### The Japanese Greater East Asia Liaison Conference Discusses Construction Policies

Furthermore, the deliberation room within the Ministry of Greater East Asia will also be actively involved in planning various construction matters. Due to Minister Aoki's appointment as the chief secretary of the Greater East Asia Construction Deliberation Council, it has also been decided to reform the operational methods in order to make more active use of it.

### German and Soviet Armies Confront Each Other on the Lower Volga River; Soviets Actively Prepare for Winter Counteroffensive; Fierce Fighting in the Western Caucasus

Allied News Agency, Stockholm, 5th: Due to the fierce attacks by the German forces on the southern front of the German-Soviet war, the Soviet forces there have begun to retreat. However, the Soviet forces on the northern front west of Moscow plan to take advantage of the winter season to attempt a full-scale counteroffensive. According to a report from Bern received by the Swiss News Agency, it is rumored that Stalin has decided to launch a large-scale counteroffensive on the 25th anniversary of the Communist Revolution. According to German reconnaissance, a large number of Soviet supply units are constantly moving towards the front line near Kalinin. German Stuka dive bombers have been conducting large-scale bombing raids on the Soviet rear communication lines.

Allied News Agency, Berlin, 5th: The German High Command issued the following war report on the night of the 5th: (1) In the eastern front, German infantry units have eliminated the stubborn resistance of the Soviet forces in the southern Caucasus region and occupied their positions. (2) The mop-up operations in the city of Stalingrad continue, and one Soviet position has been captured. Soviet counterattacks were repelled. (3) Soviet attempts at local counterattacks on the central and northern fronts have also failed.

Havas News Agency, Stockholm, 5th:

According to the latest news from the eastern front: (1) The battles in the Stalingrad area continue to be active, but neither side has made any significant progress in the past 24 hours. Tracing back to the 3rd of this month, a major battle broke out at the Volga River crossing, but neither side achieved its goals and both sides continue to hold their original positions on both banks. Neutral observers believe that both the attacking and defending forces are showing signs of fatigue. (2) In the Terek region, it is heard that the German forces have cut off the railway connecting Ordzhonikidze to Grozny somewhere between the middle and lower reaches of the Terek River. Today, a German-Italian patrol reached a point ten miles north of Ordzhonikidze.

Havas News Agency, Moscow, 5th: The Soviet High Command issued a war report tonight stating, "Today, our forces engaged in fierce battles with the enemy in the Stalingrad urban area and in the area southeast of Nalchik, east of Tuapse.

### Japan Lodges Strong Protest Against US and Canada for Maltreatment of Japanese Residents; Accuses Them of Violating Solemn Promises; Also Issues Warning to Britain

Allied News Agency, Tokyo, 6th: A responsible official of the Japanese Foreign Ministry warned today that if the British government treats prisoners of war inhumanely and violates the principles of international law regarding warfare, then the Japanese government will be forced to reconsider its current policy of treating anti-Axis prisoners of war favorably. The inhumane treatment of Axis prisoners of war has been brought to the attention of the Japanese government by the German government. The Japanese government's action is motivated by humanitarian considerations and respect for the principles of international law.

Allied News Agency, Tokyo, 6th: The Foreign Ministry disclosed today that the Japanese government lodged a strong protest with the governments of the United States and Canada in late October regarding the unreasonable treatment of Japanese residents. The Foreign Ministry issued a statement to explain the Japanese government's actions as follows: "Based on reports from representatives of the International Red Cross, radio broadcasts, and the enemy residents themselves, it is clear that since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the Japanese government has provided prisoners of war, detained civilians, and other general enemy residents with extremely fair and humane treatment. This fact is also recognized by the governments of the various enemy countries. However, the authorities of the enemy countries and countries hostile to them have consistently treated Japanese residents unreasonably and improperly. Therefore, the Japanese government has repeatedly taken necessary steps to remedy this situation. The Japanese government is particularly concerned about the United States' forced relocation of Japanese residents from the Pacific coast to the interior and lodged a very strong protest with the US government in late July. Since then, it has been closely monitoring the development. According to the reports of Japanese residents who recently returned from the United States and Canada on the first exchange ship, it has been clearly confirmed that the authorities of the United States and Canada have treated Japanese residents in a harsh and inhumane manner and still continue to do so. Therefore, the Japanese government lodged a protest with the United States and Canada again in late October through the protecting power, strongly demanding that the two countries reconsider their treatment of Japanese residents and take necessary steps to remedy it. Furthermore, the treatment of Japanese residents in British India is extremely inhumane and cannot be tolerated. Therefore, the Japanese government also lodged a strong protest in mid-September." The Japanese government's protest to the US government stated, in part, that the Japanese government was surprised to learn that Japanese residents were subjected to extremely inhumane abuse and insults by US authorities during arrest, interrogation, and detention. The US government's actions have violated its solemn declarations. Therefore, the Japanese government has lodged a very strong protest, demanding that the US government seriously consider the matter. The protest then detailed examples of the US government detaining Japanese residents without regard to their age and health and demanded that the US government immediately release elderly and infirm Japanese residents. Japanese civilians arrested on the Pacific coast were often handcuffed when being taken to detention centers and were often beaten. The Japanese government demanded that sufficient and effective measures be taken to prevent such incidents from happening again. The Japanese government's protest to the Canadian government was similar in nature.

### Colonel Hirade Speaks on the Details of the Japan-US Naval Battles, Comparing Them to Waterloo in the Pacific, Claiming the US Strength is No Longer Worthy of Attention

Allied News Agency, Kure, 6th: Naval Press Director Colonel Hirade gave a speech here last night, stating that the Japanese Navy achieved a stunning victory in the battle in the South Pacific, which was entirely provoked by the US Navy. Since the Second Naval Battle of the Solomon Islands, the Japanese side has remained silent about the war situation for strategic reasons. The enemy took advantage of this and engaged in extensive propaganda, claiming that Japan had been defeated. Until October 24, the US Navy notified the Japanese Navy, requesting a meeting near the Solomon Islands on October 26. Hence, there was a major battle in the South Pacific, the results of which have been seen in the announcement by the Imperial Headquarters on October 27. The battle was very short. US radio reporter White broadcast from San Francisco that the battle was evenly matched and it was difficult to predict who would win. If the United States wins, then it will be easy to achieve final victory. If the United States loses, then it will not be able to fight Japan in the future. In short, the battle in the South Pacific was truly the Waterloo of the Pacific. Japan has achieved an overwhelming victory. As for the fact that the US government appointed Vice Admiral Ghormley as the commander of the US fleet in the South Pacific, it is sufficient proof that the United States will concentrate its main force in the South Pacific and not pay much attention to the Atlantic. Especially since the main force of the US Pacific Fleet has sunk to the bottom of the Pacific Ocean, it is questionable whether it still has the remaining strength to launch a strong counterattack in the Pacific.

### Africa in a Changing Situation: The Independent Nation of Liberia, Founded by Eighty Black Slaves (Part 1)

One of the Powder Kegs in the Coming Great War

The Dead End of Hegemony

The night shadows are deep, and the miasma is hazy. The entire nation of Liberia is asleep. Only six hundred border guards are taking turns guarding the free land that their ancestors worked so hard to create. About twenty-eight or twenty-nine years ago, during the height of the European War, one night, several Liberian guards were stationed on a post, gazing at the Mano River. Suddenly, they noticed a small boat vaguely approaching from the upper reaches of the Mano River, drifting downstream.

After the guards signaled the boat to stop, the boat immediately docked. There were a total of five people on board: two natives and three whites. All three whites spoke a pidgin language that was popular in Africa. It turned out that they were merchants from German territories who had important matters to discuss with the President of Liberia. The President's name was Sheng, a shrewd and experienced politician.

After President Sheng had a discussion with the three merchants, he immediately convened a cabinet meeting that night. It turned out that the three merchants were the representatives of over a hundred Germans, sent to inform Liberia and the German merchants in Liberia to find ways to accommodate these hundred or so people, and that perhaps hundreds more would come in the future.

At the cabinet meeting, President Sheng raised the issue and asked the cabinet members to express their opinions. After some discussion, it was decided to allow these merchants to stay temporarily, but each person would have to take care of their own food, clothing, and shelter, and they must not cause trouble. This was the only solution, because before the start of the European War, two-thirds of Liberia's export business was in the hands of the Germans. Furthermore, Liberia was still a neutral country at this time, and it had only been founded for about seventy years, without much strength. It had no choice but to be accommodating in everything.

Where did these merchants come from? It turned out that not long after the European War started, the natives of German territories in Africa, after enduring unlimited brutality, seized the opportunity to disarm all German merchants and garrisons. As a result, all German merchants in Africa were homeless. Only this small black republic was the only way to survive.

For the first few months, these people got along well with the natives. Gradually, they became impolite. They felt that the black slaves were, after all, just black slaves, so why should they live under the eaves of black slaves? So they gradually began to use their hegemonic tactics.

President Sheng saw that the situation was not right and sent official documents to negotiate. They ignored it. He then sent diplomats to question them, and they were almost beaten. The President had no choice but to go in person, but he was met with resistance. These merchants were simply preparing to take over by force. The biggest reason was that in the second year of the European War, the German army was doing well.

The situation deteriorated day by day. The black people across the country had no choice but to use their housekeeping skills—to endure. Just as they were about to reach their limit, public sentiment was seething, and a major riot was imminent. Suddenly, a wisp of black smoke rose on the ocean surface outside the mouth of the Mano River. It turned out that a British cruiser patrolling the Atlantic was passing by to check on the侨民. At this time, the British residents staying in Liberia gave the captain a secret message from President Sheng. That night, the captain made arrangements in this way, and the next morning, hundreds of tigers once again became evicted guests. Immediately afterward, President Sheng declared that Liberia had entered a state of war. Not long after, when the United States entered the war, President Sheng officially declared that Liberia had joined the Allied forces and declared war on Germany. Therefore, the Paris Peace Conference also included a representative from the small republic of Liberia, and the Treaty of Versailles was officially signed.

History is cyclical. The last European War was like this. This time, the World War is, coincidentally, the small black republic is once again putting on its old show. Moreover, with the progress of the times, it has gone from playing a supporting role in the previous session to actually playing the leading role this time. On the vast African continent, she is vaguely a powder keg;—no, she is shouldering an even more important mission than a powder keg. This is pressed down, and will be discussed later.

Eighty Wandering Black Slaves

The name Liberia does not seem to be often heard. If it were not for the outbreak of the war, perhaps we would never have the opportunity to learn about this small black republic in our lifetime. Even in geography class at school, probably no one would bother to pay attention to this tea-bean-sized small country in Africa. Its location can be said to be at the end of the world. If Africa is compared to a large cake, Liberia is probably only the size of three sesame seeds; and it is hiding under the enormous skirt of French Sudan, so it is simply invisible if you don't look carefully.

One hundred and twenty-two years ago (1822 AD), North America promoted the liberation of black slaves. This was, of course, a humanitarian cause, but it also created a difficult problem at the same time. Originally, these black slaves relied on their masters for a living. Once they were released, they were neither文 nor 武, neither 莨 nor 莠. How were they to live? Therefore, a group of politicians and celebrities, together with charitable donors, organized an American Colonization Society. With the help of the government, they selected a forest in Africa, like a release pond, preparing to send some black slaves who had regained their freedom back to their homeland.

Who knew that the black slaves in North America, who had been civilized in the United States for a long time, heard that they would be returning to their hometown to live next to lions and 鲁鱼, and ninety-nine and a half out of a hundred did not agree. The good intentions of the philanthropists of the Colonization Society, who knew they would be treated like donkey livers, could not help but feel a little annoyed. So they came up with a policy of坚壁淸野, advising people not to hire black slaves and not to pay attention to them.

As a result, many free black slaves were left with no way to make a living. So, eighty comrades volunteered to go home and take a risk. The eighty people boarded a government ship and arrived at the designated free zone.

The report did not provide details of the armistice, but the radio station revealed that the armistice terms have been handed over to the French Governor General Annet. Furthermore, Vichy announced today only that after fierce fighting on Madagascar Island, they had withdrawn from Ambalavao at night.

### The "Second Battlefield" in the Mouth of the British Lord Privy Seal

Allied News Agency, Lisbon, 6th: According to news from London, the British Lord Privy Seal, Sir Stafford Cripps, said in a speech at a certain arsenal yesterday that the Allied forces will launch new offensives in certain areas other than North Africa. The British government hopes to open up a second battlefield.

Allied News Agency, Lisbon, 6th: According to a report from Washington, well-informed sources here claim that British Minister of Production Lyttelton, US Presidential Envoy Harriman, and other military and economic experts have arrived in Washington, and they may reach an agreement on the issue of the second front.

### Turkish-Soviet Relations

Ankara, 6th (Reuter) – The Soviet Ambassador to Turkey, Vinogradov, who returned home several months ago, has now returned to Ankara. It is widely believed that this move indicates that Turkey has notified the Soviet government through normal diplomatic channels of its willingness to find ways to reduce tensions between the two countries. It is believed that the Turkish government has made several active suggestions to the Soviet side. The amount of Soviet news released by the official Turkish news agency Anatolian Agency has recently increased significantly, and there is a good reason for this.

### US Election Results: No Policy Change Expected; Republicans Gain Ground Domestically, More Obstacles for Administrative Measures

Lisbon, 6th (Reuter) – Following the Republican election victory in the United States, the situation in the 78th United States Congress is as follows: of the thirty-two Senate seats contested, seventeen have now been won by the Republicans, and the Democrats have won fifteen. The results of the House of Representatives are not yet known. In the gubernatorial elections, the Republicans won a total of seventeen states, and the Democrats won thirteen, with three states yet to be decided. News from Washington and New York both say that Republicans are extremely jubilant about this great victory, but it should not be seen as an anti-war attitude of the American people, but only as a sanction against Roosevelt's war and administrative measures. This election is unlikely to cause any changes in American foreign policy, as foreign policy is determined by the White House and is not subject to the control of Congress. Regarding the impact of this election on the 1944 presidential election, many commentators say that Willkie and Dewey may be nominated as the main Republican candidates. The issue of Roosevelt's running for a fourth term as president has not been widely discussed.

Lisbon, 6th (Reuter) – Washington dispatch: US Vice President Wallace declared yesterday at an intelligence conference that the Republican victory in the congressional and gubernatorial elections was due to a tendency of "worker election fatigue." Workers are busy with work and have no time to consider voting. In addition, millions of young voters will soon be ordered to enlist in the army, so they also have no time to consider. For these reasons, the Republican victory was facilitated.

### US to Add Five Army Divisions

Lisbon, 6th (Reuter) – Washington dispatch: The US Department of the Army has just announced the addition of five infantry divisions, bringing the US Army to 4.5 million within two months. This is the 1942 plan to expand the US Army. Secretary of War Stimson told reporters yesterday that he opposed the Senate's amendment to the government's law lowering the draft age, as this restriction would hinder America's combat capabilities.

### Personnel Changes for French Diplomatic Staff in China

### Manufacturers Purchase Wheat in Large Quantities; Flour Supply Expected to Be Active

Bread ration from next month to be eight ounces daily

Chinese and Japanese flour manufacturers are currently purchasing wheat in large quantities in wheat-producing areas. Therefore, the flour situation in Shanghai is expected to improve significantly in the short term. Chinese manufacturers have obtained permission from the Japanese authorities to purchase wheat in Suzhou, Wuxi, and Changzhou under the supervision of the Sino-Japanese Flour Manufacturers Association. The maximum price has been set by the authorities at 180 yuan per dan.

Chinese and Japanese Manufacturers Purchase Wheat Separately

The banking group formed by the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, Zhejiang Industrial Bank, Shanghai Commercial & Savings Bank, and the Central China Bank has recently lent a large sum to flour mills such as Fuxin and Fufeng specifically for purchasing flour in the interior. As for Japanese flour mills, they are purchasing wheat in Zhenjiang and Wuhu. It is reported that twenty-seven Japanese flour mills have formed a group to strictly manage the purchase of wheat in the Wuhu area. The activities of Shanghai flour mills were previously hindered by the lack of wheat, but now that they have obtained the convenience of purchasing, they will inevitably show an upward trend in the short term. An increase in flour production is expected, which is welcomed by the business community as it can make the food situation in the city more stable.

Bread Ration Resets Allotment

According to the English-language "Ta Mei Wan Pao," the Shanghai Municipal Council and the French Municipal Council have announced that from December 1st, the daily bread ration in the two concessions will be reduced from ten ounces to eight ounces, and the daily flour allocation will be one pound. However, this does not refer to those who hold rice purchase certificates. The issuance of bread certificates is under the jurisdiction of the Food Management Office at 2 Fuli Li Road, the French Concession, and the Rice and Food Office at 209 Jiangxi Road, Shanghai Municipal Council Building. Certificates for December of this year and January of next year can be obtained by each head of household with their identity card from October 16th to 27th. Those who do not go to collect them within this time limit will have their registration cancelled.

Chinese Only Allowed to Receive Two Ounces

According to reports from a Datong News Agency reporter, since the bread distribution in the two concessions has been handled by the Cai Guan Committee, it has been stipulated that each foreigner will be given eight ounces of bread per day, while Chinese bread eaters will only be allowed to purchase two ounces with a ticket. As for the date of receiving the certificate, it is the same as for foreigners. The location for receiving the certificate is the same as the location of the office for issuing rice purchase certificates in their respective districts.

### Shanghai Municipal Council Urges Doctor Registration

The Shanghai Municipal Council issued Notice No. 6101 on September 23rd, announcing that those engaged in internal medicine, surgery, dentistry, or veterinary medicine within the concession should register with the Health Department. It is now learned that the Council has issued another Notice No. 6151, urging doctors to register by the deadline. Doctors who fail to register in accordance with the regulations will be subject to a fine of up to 200 yuan or other penalties. When registering, the doctor should personally go to Office No. 17 of the Health Department at 223 Hankou Road to fill out the form.

Doctor Registration Records to Be Reprinted

The Shanghai Municipal Council Information Office announced that the new doctor registration record is about to be printed. Doctors, dentists, and veterinarians who have registered with the Council's Health Department should notify the Registration Office, Office No. 17 of the Health Department at 223 Hankou Road, of any changes in their business or residential address, including their new address and telephone number, before December 1st in order to make the necessary changes.

### Currency Conversion Method for Creditors and Debtors of Military-Managed Enterprises; Central Reserve Bank Notes as the Sole Currency; Foreign Currency Conversion Methods Established

In conjunction with the China Liaison Department of the Asia Development Board, in view of the fact that the managers of military-managed enterprises have always calculated in old legal tender, British pounds, Hong Kong dollars, US dollars, and other currencies, which is quite inconvenient for accounting, the following methods are specially formulated to unify them: (1) All enterprises entrusted to this management shall use Reserve Bank Notes as the sole currency. (2) If the former is calculated in old legal tender, it will now be converted to Reserve Bank Notes at a ratio of two to one. (3) If the former is calculated in Hong Kong dollars, US dollars, or British pounds, it will now be converted to Reserve Bank Notes at the following ratios: 4.76 yuan of Reserve Bank Notes per Hong Kong dollar, 8.93 yuan of Reserve Bank Notes per US dollar, and 76.03 yuan of Reserve Bank Notes per British pound. (4) This method can, in principle, be traced back to December 8th of last year. (5) If the old legal tender claims and debts of December 8th of last year have been fulfilled, they will be processed at the Reserve Bank Note market price on the date of fulfillment. (6) If the claims and debts generated after December 8th (not calculated in Reserve Bank Notes) have been fulfilled, they will be processed at the Reserve Bank Note market price on the date of fulfillment. If they have not been fulfilled, they will be processed at the official Reserve Bank Note market price. (7) The accounts of claims and debts generated after December 8th of last year will be calculated at the Reserve Bank Note market price on the date of accounting. (8) If there are special circumstances that cannot be easily resolved by the above-mentioned regulations, the handling method must be approved by the authorities.

### Edible Oil Stocks Should Be Supplied to the Market as Much as Possible; Part of the Orders Signed

More than 22,000 Dan of School Expenses for October

According to the English-language "The Times," it was learned yesterday that the Edible Oil Industry Wholesale Office, in view of the urgent needs of the public, has requested its members to supply their stocks to the market as much as possible. The implementation of this step is due to public demand to remedy the current panic. At the same time, it is also learned that various edible oil industry groups have submitted a request to the local authorities to increase the monthly allocation to retailers. It is said that the current average monthly allocation is a total of 20,000 dan, but the Wholesale Office requests at least 30,000 dan so that it can be allocated to 2,000 stores.

More than 20,000 Dan of School Expenses Last Month

According to news from the Wholesale Office, the consumption of edible oil in Shanghai in October was 22,468 dan, an increase of 8,080 dan compared to September. This consumed edible oil includes 12,926.34 dan of soybean oil, 9,514.39 dan of sesame oil, and 27.71 dan of other vegetable oils.

Orders Signed, Awaiting Movement Permits

The Retail and Wholesale Office of the same industry negotiated with the Military Distribution Group authorities for a fixed order of 1,000 tons (20,000 dan) of edible oil. 500 tons of which were signed the day before yesterday, but due to the lack of movement permits, no distribution is possible at present. The Wholesale Office is actively requesting them, and it is said that they may be obtained in the near future. As soon as the movement permits are obtained, they will be distributed to the retail stores.

Restaurants and Taverns Can Register to Receive Certificates

The Shanghai Edible Oil Industry Wholesale Office has found it difficult for restaurants and taverns to purchase oil in whole numbers. Restaurants and taverns have requested the Wholesale Office to find a remedy. The Office, after investigation, confirmed that it was a real situation, but was unable to sell directly due to compliance with the regulations. Therefore, it also uses registration application procedures to grant the lowest prescribed amount according to their needs and issue purchase certificates. The certificate contains all the terms and conditions, and both the seller and the buyer must comply with the regulations. The certificate states that the certificate can be used to purchase from any of the registered retail store members, and sales and purchases must be made in accordance with the prescribed retail price. All oil purchased with this certificate can be reimbursed by the retail store to the Office by showing the certificate written by the purchaser. The Office will replenish the amount accordingly. In this way, it will not hinder the retail store's sales volume and reduce the needs of the general public, and it can also relieve the oil purchase difficulties of restaurants and taverns. As for profits, they all belong to the retail store.

Business News

### Class C Bonds Enjoy Exclusive Favor; Classes A and B Still Distorted

The public bond market yesterday showed a fluctuating situation, and transactions were also significantly reduced. In this adverse environment, this kind of fluctuating and stable situation is quite commendable. Major buyers are watching, and sellers are still waiting for opportunities. Class C bonds struggled for quite a while when they reached 5.67 yuan midway. The stagnation on the surface is unprecedented and will only develop after the authorities issue a second warning. Observing the surface, it is still weak and soft. Class C bonds, after falling 8 yuan twice last Saturday and this Monday, have only recovered one or two yuan to the present and have seen 6 yuan four times but have consistently failed to break through. The current prices are all above 50 yuan, with the price of Class C bonds at 55.60 yuan being the highest overall. Classes A and B are still far behind, indicating that both bulls and bears are concentrated in Class C bonds, which is the origin of the distorted situation of Classes A and B. There will be many future changes, and it should not be ignored due to fluctuations. This is the calm before the storm. The market price results all rose by one to seven cents, except for 96, which rose by only 4 cents. The turnover was 2.67 million yuan. A simplified table is listed below:

### Hua Stock Market Calms Slightly

Yesterday's situation in the Chinese stock market saw mixed gains and losses. Cultural stocks and new pharmaceutical companies were still favored by investors. China-France Pharmacy suddenly rose by 10 yuan, Minyi rose by 6 yuan, and Yongxiang Printing rose by another yuan. Zhonghua and Shijie both rose by four or five yuan. Guohuo continued its upward trend from the previous day, reaching a high price of 148 yuan, then slightly fell back but still rose by 6 yuan. Yong'an slightly rose by 1 yuan, and Xin Xin remained flat. Textile stocks continued to decline due to falling raw material prices. Yong'an Textile fell by another 30 yuan. In the public utilities sector, Zhabei Water and Electricity recovered slightly by half a cent. Huashang Electric continued to rise by two and a half cents. Nanyang Tobacco Company rose by two yuan. The trading of Gongxin Electric Appliances remained brisk, with transactions at 17.75 yuan. Xinhua Paint and Gongli Tricycle showed a firm trend. Today's market price list is below:

### Yarn Prices Plunge; Cloth Market Greatly Weakened

Factory Cloth: Yesterday's market saw a sharp drop in yarn prices, leading to a weakened sentiment. The asking prices for white goods and coarse cloth from local factories fell by two or three yuan per piece, with few transactions. Due to buyers' wait-and-see attitude, there were no accurate market prices for other cloths. However, the closing price for Peach Blossom Lady Lin in the morning fell to 285 yuan, and further declined to around 280 in the afternoon.

Eastern Cloth: Rebounded and fell sharply, with a fierce downward trend. The new order closing price for 12-pound Longtou fine cloth was 193 yuan, a decrease of 7.5 yuan. Bank order Longtou was 185 yuan, Caiqiu 185.5 yuan, Feiyu 184 yuan, Yanghe 183 yuan, and Laba 182 yuan, all declining by six or seven yuan per piece. The opening price for Four Gentlemen Serge red orders was 7.6334 yuan, falling directly to 7.4 yuan. The noon closing price slightly recovered to 7.412 yuan.

### Ornament Gold Prices Unchanged

Yesterday, the ornament gold price at Dasin and other gold stores in this city remained unchanged at 2,650 yuan per tael for sales (purchase price reduced by more than 300 yuan). The inter-dealer price had already retreated into the 2,400 yuan range, continuing the sluggish trend from the previous day due to excess supply. In the morning, it was 2,400 yuan, down 5 yuan immediately, then continued to fall by 40 yuan, retreating to a low price of 2,360 yuan. It only stabilized at noon, reaching 2,370 yuan, a difference of 35 to 40 yuan. Transactions were thin. The price of ornament silver per tael remained at 67 cents, also slightly sluggish. The clearing interest rate of the Money Industry Association remained unchanged at 1.4 cents.

Yesterday's foreign currency market saw a slight decline in Japanese military notes. The inter-dealer price was 5.5535 yuan, and the retail price at banks and small money shops was also sluggish at 5.56 yuan. The purchase price remained at 5.55 yuan.

### Coarse Grains Trading Quiet as Usual

Yesterday's coarse grain trading remained quiet, with only 40 packages of dried Qingdao sweet potatoes being sold at a price of 153 yuan. There were no other transactions.

Soybean cake supply and demand were still balanced, with little price change. Kai Kai-chang Brand soybean cake was 72 yuan per thousand pieces, Yuanlong soybean cake was 71.25 yuan per carload, and Feizi soybean cake was 73.75 yuan per carload.

### Commercial Briefs

Ordinary walnuts have slightly fallen, and new arrivals are expected soon. Due to a wait-and-see attitude among merchants and lower counter-offers, the trend has weakened. It is reported that a batch of goods has already been shipped, about one-tenth smaller than before, fluctuating by dozens of yards. The market trend is also slightly looser.

Medium-grade longan prices are loosening. It is reported that some stores in the northern part of the city have already shipped out a small amount. Because of the inferior color, they cannot get a good price and have loosened by one or two hundred yards, resulting in immediate transactions. Retailers are also accommodating because merchants are not greedy.

Zhigung Ni Supply and Demand are Both Quiet: Ever since the Zhigung Ni robe was eliminated ten years ago, sales have plummeted. Currently, it only relies on the limited output of shoe stores on this street. Furthermore, due to the weakening economic strength of all sectors, most small shoe stores use cotton-woven imitations. Factories have also mostly stopped production due to expensive and scarce raw materials, leading to a shortage of goods in the market and difficulty in buying and selling. Yesterday, Yongxing No. 10,000 and Yinfeng Caishen Hu Yuan Zhigung Ni currently sold for 110 yuan per yard in bulk.

Daguan Pi Lacks Sales: Transactions of 36-foot Daguan Pi are rare in both retail and wholesale. This is because the Tianjin-Qingdao cigarette and other gangs have stopped operating, and the number of enamel factories, can factories, and printing factories on this street that purchase them is also very small. In addition, there are few storefront decorations, so the market is in a state of stagnation. Yesterday, the official brand flower color still opened at 20,000 yuan per ton, the top-quality goods at 16,000 yuan, and Nos. 12 to 14 at 14,000 yuan, with 2,000 pounds of black iron billets per ton shouting for 15,000 yuan, but there were no transactions in the end. In addition, new steel plates also opened at 20,000 yuan per ton (thin flower color), and thick flower color was quoted at 18,000 yuan. Xinlu leather (flower color slightly increased) was 14,000 yuan per ton.

### Why Does the Play Only Praise Virtuous Mothers?

— Xu Muyun

Chinese dramas have always been known for praising the records and anecdotes of loyal ministers, filial sons, righteous servants, and chaste women. However, loyal ministers and filial sons often rely on the encouragement and education of virtuous mothers. For example, Wu Han in "Killing the Sutra Hall," Yao Qi in "Ascending to Heaven's Terrace," Zhou Yuji in "Ningwu Pass," Wang Ling in "Mother Lying on the Sword," and Zhuan Zhu in "Assassinating King Liao" all benefited from the upbringing of virtuous mothers. Moreover, the virtuous mothers mentioned above were all able to use their deaths (either by hanging, self-immolation, or lying on the sword) to strengthen their sons' determination to serve the country, thus becoming virtuous prime ministers and famous officials, patriotic martyrs who were famous for thousands of years and left a lasting legacy. Others, such as Xu's mother in "Striking Cao Yan," were able to defy the threat of the cauldron and money, scolding the bandits to death. As for Yue Fei's mother in "Yue Fei's Tattoo," she was able to educate her son to become a great man in our country's history, and her foresight and vision were undoubtedly superior. The above are just a few of the prominent examples. Other small virtues and those not yet included in dramas are too numerous to mention.

However, there is one thing that I cannot understand, and that is that the Wang Yun and Yan Song types in dramas are either three-dynasty veterans who are greedy for wealth and afraid of death or muddle-headed old men who harbor rebellious intentions and are willing to be cattle and horses for their children and grandchildren (Yan Song often said, "I think my son, Shi Fan, was born in the same year, same month, and same day as Emperor Jiajing. Jiajing has the honor of the Son of Heaven. Shouldn't my son have a share of the nine-five position?" As a Grand Secretary, he was still not content, leading to his own death, which was truly foolish). If, as in the play, there are those who, like Wu She and Wu Jianzhang, insult the ruler in the hall, unafraid of the cruelty of having their teeth knocked out and their tongues cut off, then, apart from these two, there are few others to be found. In fact, the number of people who achieve fame through their mothers' education is not necessarily greater than those who achieve it through their fathers' education. However, in the era of monarchs, how many loyal ministers and martyrs were either poisoned by powerful traitors or died on the battlefield? Having sacrificed themselves for the country and being far away from their hometowns, how could they be able to reunite with their mothers and sons and receive the grace of education from time to time? Moreover, there is often the saying in the drama, "Loyal and good people will not have their lineage cut off." It can be seen that even if the father dies in battle, the mother and son may still be spared sometimes. The mother often encourages her son with the tragic death of the father, and the son firmly remembers the father's hatred, strives to make something of himself, and is also able to inherit the father's ambition and become a loyal and good person. It seems that it is the virtuous mother's education, but in reality, the virtuous father has already set a good example for his children and grandchildren. Although the virtuous mother's righteous deeds and heroic deeds in the play are mostly performed on the spot and witnessed by her son, they can give the audience a deep impression. If Wu She and others are executed in secret and are separated from their sons by thousands of miles, hearing the news of revenge is not as painful and tragic as being there at the moment. Moreover, in the feudal era, Wu Zixu and Yun Zhao's whipping of corpses in Chu and resisting the royal army were all minor displays of loyalty. Compared with the deeds of the virtuous mothers mentioned above, they are very different. Therefore, the large number of virtuous mothers in the play is probably due to the main reason.

### Watching "The Sea of Fragrant Snow"

— Xin Qi

"The Sea of Fragrant Snow" is advertised as bringing together international stars, such as Miss Shanghai Louise, the Nelson sisters, etc. However, after enjoying it, the reporter feels that in addition to those stars, the other artists are also worth mentioning. Let's start with Liang Ping. Liang Ping is a newcomer in the singing world, but her artistry, as demonstrated this time, is indeed very mature. Her singing of "Autumn Nostalgia" is so warm, so poetic, and so full of passion that it is no wonder the audience applauds and asks her to sing another excerpt. The only flaw is that Miss Liang did not take on any role in the second act of the show.

Next are the Cuban sisters. These two Western beauties perform martial arts in the first act. I don't know why, but I never feel interested in women performing martial arts. But in the second act, they wore golden and brilliant Chinese cheongsams and sang a Chinese song. Their pronunciation was as accurate as that of a professional performer, and their singing was vivid and nuanced, making the Chinese audience beam with joy.

As for the pole stunts and comic magic, although they won the praise of most of the audience, I think it is a bit unbearable to take others' adventures as one's own enjoyment. Therefore, I still prefer to watch Sun Tai's ventriloquism. He relies solely on his mouth to imitate the chirping of birds, making the audience feel as if they have entered a forest in spring. In particular, "Island Children Calling for Spring" is portrayed vividly, making people laugh out loud.

Finally, there is the wild Western act, which involves the entire cast. Although it is grand in scale, I still feel that it is not tight enough. However, out of the twenty acts in the entire program, the ones listed above are enough to satisfy me.

### The Success of "The Circus"

— Xin Tang

If we talk about art in a proper manner and not just about gimmicks, then, in all honesty, Zuo Lin's "The Circus" is indeed a good play rarely seen on the Shanghai stage in recent years. The "Shanghai Art Theater" used it as its opening shot in the second half of this year, and it was definitely not wrong. This play has been running for a full four weeks now, but the box office is still very good. On the one hand, it is due to the improvement in the appreciation of the audience for spoken drama. However, without such a good script, such a good director, and such good actors, it would not have been so successful!

The most commendable thing is that the "Shanghai Art Theater" did not need to do "extremely vicious" publicity before or after the performance of this play, and the audience was always crowded. What did it rely on? It relied on word of mouth! Because every theatergoer who came out of the Carlton was full of praise.

Shi Hui's performance as Murong Tianxi is as brilliant as Liang Commissioner in "Transformation," while Zhang Fa's Xiaochong, Qiao Qi's Dazi, Shi Yuan's Huihui, Lu Shan's Gai Sanye, and Yingzi's Cuibao all have outstanding performances that surpass everything else. Moreover, it is said that they are all very excited on stage. Although they have performed more than forty shows, they do not feel tired at all and feel that performing such a good play is a pleasure.

Huang Long's voice, which he thought was as light as it could be, still sounded like thunder in Wei Cheng's ears. He took Huang Long's hand off his chest and said, "Please don't joke with me. This is not a joking matter. I respect you in everything, but I'm afraid you'll just shout wildly without thinking. Shouting is harmful and useless." Huang Long said, "I won't shout, I won't shout. Who wants to shout? Only your son shouts. Tell me, what's this Miss Chen doing? Do you really want to make her your wife?" Wei Cheng couldn't help but laugh dryly, "In your mouth, everything becomes rough. Wife, wife, how ugly that sounds." Huang Long laughed: "Not wife, it's Miss Chen, tell me, what are you doing?" Wei Cheng thought, he had always regarded Huang Long as a confidant and told him everything. Huang Long also saw himself as his brother, and he was willing to do whatever he could. Logically, he should also let him know about this big event, and he might be able to help me.

Wei Cheng pressed Huang Long into the chair and said, "Long brother, I'm encountering another problem now." Huang Long said, "Problem? Tell me, I'll do it for you. These days, I'm going to get sick from being idle. In the water, I'll go in the water; in the fire, I'll go in the fire!" He always said that, patting his chest while speaking. Wei Cheng pressed Huang Long down again, afraid that he would stand up. Sitting on the edge of the bed opposite him, he waved his hand and said, "The problem I'm talking about is really a problem. If you listen to me, first, don't jump up when you hear it; second, don't shout when you hear it. I'll only tell you if you can agree to these two conditions." Huang Long saw Wei Cheng speaking slowly, and he couldn't bear it anymore. He took out a handkerchief full of oil stains from his body and threw it to Wei Cheng and said: "I'll listen to you in everything. If you're afraid I'll shout, you can seal my mouth; if you're afraid I'll jump, you can tie up my feet. I'll always listen to you, not shout or jump, seal it up, tie it up, you can do whatever you want." Wei Cheng said okay, put Chen Guofang's photo and Cheng Bing's photo together, and asked, "Look, do these two people look alike?" Huang Long looked straight, looked sideways, and said, "They do look alike. Who is this man? He's still wearing a leather vest. This outfit used to exist, but now it doesn't." (223)
