### President Roosevelt Declares Decisive Aid Will Be Given to Australia; Australia Will Establish Supreme War Council with General MacArthur as Chairman

But the war is happening thousands of miles away from the United States, and transporting military supplies and ammunition to the Philippines and Australia to supply the troops, and the shortage of ships, are things we cannot forget. The United States has a large number of skilled workers engaged in military production work, but how to best use these skilled workers must be determined. Regarding this, the government may issue orders to mobilize workers nationwide."

### Fire at Silk Shop on Ningbo Road; One Child Burned to Death; Fire Under Control After Half an Hour; Silk Worth Hundreds of Thousands of Dollars Destroyed

At around 0:00 yesterday morning, a sudden fire broke out at No. 284, Lane 15 on Ningbo Road in the Public Concession. The flames soared into the sky. The houses at that number were old-style, so the fire spread very quickly. After the Central Fire Brigade learned of the fire, they dispatched fire trucks, which arrived at the scene of the fire at 0:06. At that time, the fire had already penetrated the roof, and the flames were soaring into the sky, and the walls of the house were also burning.

Nearly Affected

The firefighters and others in the neighboring houses immediately used the two pump trucks that had arrived to spray liquid and tried to prevent the fire from spreading to the neighboring houses. However, the lane was very narrow, making rescue difficult, so the flames were able to cross the lane and burn down many of the balconies of the houses opposite. Fortunately, the firefighters quickly poured water to extinguish the fire, and the fire was brought under control after 34 minutes. About an hour later, the fire was completely extinguished. As a result, the houses at that number were completely destroyed, and the Yichang Silk Store and Yuan Mianbu Store opened inside.

Serious Loss

The silk stored there, worth hundreds of thousands of dollars, was completely burned. In addition, a child was burned to death. After dawn, the firefighters found his body in the rubble, completely charred, a tragic sight. There were also a mother and child who knelt down before the fire trucks arrived and were unharmed. The woman first wrapped her child in a quilt and threw it out of the window, and then she also jumped down. Both mother and child were unharmed. It was learned later that the fire started downstairs and soon spread to the upstairs and the roof. The house was originally an old-style building, with the interior made of wood, and the stored silk was easy to catch fire, so the fire spread rapidly and could not be contained.

In the sixteenth minute of the battle, Colasa received a pass from Gaines, and swept from 20 yards. The ball went into the net, and the Portuguese army took the lead with a score of two to one. During a mixed battle four minutes later, Fei Chunhua and Yuan Kuntian both rushed forward, and Jia Youliang took the opportunity to mix in and gently passed to Xiao Ziwen. Victor stepped forward and Ziwen headed the ball into the enemy's formation, again making a tie. Time ran out, and the two sides had a 2-2 tie, waiting for the final match on the 30th of this month.

China: Fan Jinyong, Zhuang Youren, Zhang Linggen, Chen Xiaoping (replaced by Jiang Chao), Han Longhai, Zhang Zhaopeng, Xiao Ziwen, Gao Baozheng, Dai Linjing, Jia Youliang, Fei Chunhua

### Gold Prices Slightly Strengthen; Gold Pounds Each Rise Ten Yuan

Yesterday, the cash spot price of gold fluctuated and strengthened, hovering around the 17,000 yuan mark. Under the control news, cash shops sold non-stop, but military tickets rose, and Central Reserve Bank notes followed suit, and people's hearts turned to prosperity. Securities firms absorbed the market, and chips felt scarce again. In the early morning, it was 17,000 yuan, and when the market opened, it was 17,100 yuan, which was 400 yuan higher than the afternoon closing on the previous day. Da Zhong vigorously advanced five or six hundred taels, and He Fa and Hong Qing Yong absorbed in two times. Yi Mao Yong shorted, and the price rose to 17,300 yuan. Cash shops rose and sold vigorously, and Shi Hecheng, Ji Wanfeng, Sheng Da Yong, and a certain securities firm sold actual goods, and the price plummeted by 700 yuan, falling to 16,600 yuan, and then the Nanjing gang vigorously raised the price to around 17,000 yuan, rising to 17,050 yuan. Cash shops and jewelry businesses sold, and the price fell to 16,700 yuan, and the securities firms vigorously advanced, and the market price was 17,000 yuan, which was 300 yuan higher than the closing price on the previous day, and the range on the day was 700 yuan, and after closing, it was 16,900 yuan, and after noon, the closing price was 17,100 yuan to 17,200 yuan, and the transaction was not strong, and it rose to 17,700 yuan in the afternoon. The price of gold jewelry per tael increased by 100 yuan in the afternoon, to 1,850 yuan (purchase reduced by 200 yuan). The black market for silver was still tired, falling to 12 or 13 yuan, and there were still few buyers, and the price of silver coins also fell to 8 yuan. Yesterday's foreign exchange market conditions, British and American gold pounds each rose by ten yuan, the former to 400 yuan, and the latter to 410 yuan. U.S. dollar bills returned slightly to 20 yuan, 30 to 40 cents, and Hong Kong bills rose to 3 yuan, 40 cents, and large bills were reduced by 10 cents, and military tickets rose to 7 yuan and 45 cents.

### Cotton Yarn Prices Rise Strongly

The cotton yarn market situation has turned upwards, and the rising trend is quite strong, because of military tickets. The initial opening price of 20 count double factory singles was 3,105 yuan. After a while, due to the spitting out of the bulls, it relaxed to 3,050 yuan. Afterwards, it revolved outside 3,100 yuan for a long time. Unexpectedly, the market for 42 count thread and 20 count spot yarn was good, and people's hearts were very tight. Approaching the close, the market suddenly jumped horizontally to 3,305 yuan, and the closing price returned to 3,270 yuan. 42 count Blue Phoenix was 7,420 yuan to 7,720 yuan, 60 count Sunlight was 17,350 yuan, 42 count Water Moon was 7,550 yuan, 40 count Color Ball was 7,150 yuan, 40 count Golden Tiger was 7,200 yuan, 60 count Bull Head was 15,500 yuan, 32 count Red Joy was 6,420 yuan, 20 count Moon Lute was 4,110 yuan, 20 count Blue Phoenix was 4,500 yuan, 20 count Double Feng was 3,800 yuan to 3,950 yuan, 20 count Heavenly Girl was 3,750 yuan, 18 count Weaver Girl was 4,100 yuan, 17 count Color Ball was 3,900 yuan, 14 count Golden Tower was 3,450 yuan, 16 count Golden Bridge was 3,720 yuan, 10 count Boy Scouts was 2,670 yuan, and 10 count Double Earth was 2,580 yuan.

### Cloth Market Watching

Non-Industry Continues to Search

Factory Cloth Yesterday's market was due to the rebound of military tickets, and the hoarding of households was strong again, and the price of coarse and fine cloth continued to shout three or four yuan per piece, but the actual customer sales were still silent, so the transaction was not strong, 16 pound Flying Hong coarse cloth was 156 yuan, Globe was 165 yuan, 16 Great Peng fine cloth was 151 yuan, Fugui was 149 yuan, Fugui fine twill was 135 yuan, Chickey Shirting was 23 yuan, Anan Blue cloth was 180 yuan, Longevity Fuchou was 5 yuan, 70 cents, Wanmuli was 5 yuan, 45 cents, and White Cat printed cloth was 125 yuan, all of which were being made.

East Cloth Yesterday was Saturday, and there was only half a day of trading in the morning, and the industry was in a slump, because the mobile certificate will be implemented from April 1, and before the control measures are announced, everyone is holding a wait-and-see attitude, so although the prices of the various cloth markets are constantly searched by non-industry hoarding households, the rise is very slow, and the new single of the leading fine cloth opened at 192 to 3 yuan in the morning, and it revolved for a long time, and it was heard at the close of noon that the military tickets and the variable horse yarn were both expensive, pulling up to 194 yuan and 50 cents, a relatively large increase of 1 yuan and 50 cents per piece, and the spot price was 168 yuan and 50 cents, the same trademark, with a difference of 26 yuan per piece, which is really shocking. The color ball flying fish fine cloth was opened at 173 yuan and 50 cents, Yanghe was 172 yuan, and Trumpet was 170 yuan, which also increased by one or two yuan per piece. The price of the Four Gentlemen Serge was 5 yuan and 85 cents for the factory single from October to December, 5 yuan, 56 cents for the red single new tax, and the spot price was only 5 yuan and 30 cents, which is 55 cents per yard lower than the old single from October to December, which is enough to prove that the actual sales are not moving.

### Woolen Fabrics Only Rise and Do Not Fall

The prices of various goods in the woolen fabrics market yesterday still only rose and did not fall, and were still like kites, getting higher and higher. Summer goods such as feather yarn woolen fabrics, flannel, palette cloth, fat Belch, Faner Top, Pliss, yarn linen glue cloth, white serge, white straight tribute, etc. The rising trend is even sharper. Spring sales of Western-style thin flower woolen fabrics, grass green twill, thin plain serge, etc. are also quite firm for a while, because actual sales have started, and buyers need to pick up goods early, and there is an unusual lack of goods at the bottom. The industry is hoarding and unwilling to sell, and non-industry hoarding households are searching. Factory goods of flannel are out of stock, and imported goods must be sold for 140 yuan per yard for the first number, 115 yuan for the second number, and 100 yuan for the second number. Feather yarn, palette cloth, and fan Top all offer more than 100 yuan. Most of the Shenzhi local factory goods must also be sold for more than seventy yuan.

### Public Bonds Turn Weak Again; Stock Market Rebounds

The public bond dark market turned weak again yesterday, and sellers sought to sell, but those who accepted were few and far between, and the general public had no intention of doing so. On the one hand, the winterers are anxious to come out of the cage, and they have to depreciate the price to seek to escape the market price, which is still a little more than one yuan, but it is still the usual practice to go elsewhere, and it is also a special and deformed situation created by the environment for a while. Yesterday, the largest number of purchases and sales was no more than 30,000, so the total turnover was no more than 200,000 yuan, and the market price has fallen by as much as six corners to one yuan and four corners. A brief table is listed below:

Yesterday, foreign stocks were stable, and the turnover was sparse, with 7,200 shares. Jardine Spinning retreated to 25.1.25 yuan and returned to 25.5 yuan, Shanghai Plush 6 yuan 45 cents, Jardine Beer 6 yuan 23 cents, British United 21 yuan, Kaiping 137 yuan, Yeguang 17 yuan 45 cents, Paper One Industry 6 yuan 25 cents and 6 yuan 30 cents, Electricity One Car 35 yuan 75 cents and 40 yuan, Yang Yizi 10 yuan and 9 cents, and 10,000 yuan of power bonds, priced at 75 yuan. The rest, such as Navigation One Industry, had a purchase price of 7 yuan and a sale price of 7 yuan and 9 cents, China One Spinning 10 yuan 35 cents, China Camp 10 yuan and 51 cents and 11 yuan, Xiangtai Timber 245 yuan, Reclamation 25 yuan, Steel Industry 12 yuan, Telephone 25 yuan, Xinho Spinning 7 yuan, Telephone Bonds 72 yuan, British Zhahua 15 yuan and 50 cents, Langerzhi 14 yuan, and Kelohua 1.5 yuan.

Yesterday, the Hua stock market was also affected by the rise in military tickets, and people's hearts were optimistic. The market was firm, Yong'an Company was 74 yuan, Xinxin was 75 yuan, and each rose by one or two yuan. China Underwear rose from 18 yuan to 18 yuan and 75 cents (old), 18.15 yuan rose to 19 yuan. Great China Match 112 yuan and 50 cents, Nanyang Tobacco Company 55 yuan and 50 cents, New Asia (new) book 2 yuan and 50 cents, and Sino-French (new) 45 yuan, all of which had transactions. World Bookstore 50 yuan and 5 cents, the public utilities stock was stable, and the textile industry was sparsely traded.

### Grain Merchants Gradually Become Aware

Yesterday, amidst the rising prices of various goods, the market for miscellaneous grains remained flat. Because of the lessons learned from wheat bran, speculators have gradually restrained themselves, and only the shops on the street are scattered, and the results are mixed. Yellow beans fell by two or three yuan, barnyard beans rose by three or five yuan, red beans were flat, and bean cake rose by one or two yuan. It is estimated that 90 bags of Tianjin Jinyuan were sold, priced at 210 yuan to 208 yuan, 50 bags of South Bridge yellow beans, priced at 188 yuan, 200 bags of Chongming sand barnyard beans, priced at 230 yuan to 240 yuan, and 100 bags of sand red beans, priced at 189 yuan to 190 yuan, 20 bags of Tianjin red beans, priced at 185 yuan, and 60 bags of Benniu red beans, priced at 175 yuan to 173 yuan, 1,000 pieces of Han" bean cake, priced at 38 yuan, two vehicles of Feizi bean cake, 47 yuan and 80 cents for the November warehouse order, and 54 yuan and 50 cents for the new warehouse order, and 2,000 pieces of Shengji bean cake, 53 yuan for the May warehouse order, and 53 yuan and 25 cents to 54 yuan for the June warehouse order.

Family

### Family Happiness Depends on Mutual Effort

— Hefeng

People are always dissatisfied with reality. A married man often complains about the heavy burden of the family and has no smile all day long. A lively girl suddenly steps into the family circle and only feels lonely and uncomfortable. Before my marriage, a classmate came to talk to me about a college graduate couple. After marriage, the man went home. Because he had socialized enough outside, he was too lazy to talk when he got home, and he didn't want to go out to play anymore. The woman waited at home all day, thinking about this and that, thinking about the past and the future, and she already felt extremely bored in her heart. When her husband came back, seeing that her husband's face was serious, she couldn't say a word, and the loneliness in her heart expanded even more, so she recalled the husband's various considerations and tenderness towards herself before marriage, and felt that marriage was simply the tomb of love. From then on, she told people she met, "Don't marry. After marriage, love will disappear." So the feelings between the couple gradually became cold.

I told him my meaning: "Marriage is originally a very ordinary thing, and it will never be as enthusiastic as when you are in love. People who are together every day cannot be compared with those who are hard to meet. The previous husband was your lover. Because of various obstacles, of course, you felt sweet and rare when you met, but the sweetness of marriage should be thought of as the completion of previous hopes. Who doesn't want to be together forever after falling in love? Only marriage can fulfill your wish. Therefore, after marriage, you should not only use the brief moment of the past to compare this life with permanent common significance. That kind of comparison is not only a bit nitpicking, but also abnormal, because that kind of too sweet and too painful love life is fundamentally abnormal and cannot last long. Only marriage is a long-lasting, normal, common, and praiseworthy life.

"After marriage, men have the burden of the family, and the wife should share the fatigue and pain caused by this burden. If a wife cannot share this burden, but instead complains and is full of jealousy, that is the wife's responsibility. If every wife can understand her husband and maintain a calm attitude when her husband is tired, I think the husband's fatigue will disappear more easily." My friend thought about my meaning and smiled and said, "Look at you."

"I can do this," I always tell him.

### Home Massage for Spring in the Corners of the Eyes

— Wang Yizhi

I used to see young women in poor families in China with dark circles under their eyes and deeply sunken lower eyelids, which harmed their appearance, affected their own destiny, and the future of their families. I wished I could lend a hand to help and save this silver wave at the bottom of the curtain and this spiritual quagmire.

It has been found that wrinkles on the lower eyelids are not only caused by old age. Some people are troubled by sorrow, misguided by abnormal life, or cry too much or suffer from insomnia, even though they are not old. This is because the lower eyelids contain many veins that communicate blood circulation, and there are inner secretory light yellow lymph glands. When people are sad, angry, decadent, and tired, their internal bodies are often deficient in blood and lymph. The skin outside the eyes is caused by the sudden expansion and contraction of the veins and glands. The skin outside the eyes is concave and convex, and wrinkles appear from time to time. To eliminate this pain, there are three ways:

We should eliminate the long nights of gambling that reduce sleep and tire the spirit, and instead engage in normal entertainment that helps the body, benefits knowledge, grows experience, and benefits the group.

Try simple massage. Both the upper and lower eyelids are delicate, and the lower eyelids are especially important. It is sufficient for the practitioner to perform it twice a day. It is advisable to rely only on the fingertips of the left and right index and middle fingers, gently touch the eyelids, and carefully massage. First, gently touch the upper eyelid between the eyebrows and eyelashes with the fingertips of the two fingers, starting from the upper end of the bridge of the nose and spreading to the left and right. Then, gently touch the lower eyelid with the fingertips of the two fingers, and change the direction from the left and right sides to the center of the bridge of the nose. Do not use too much force when wiping, and do not squeeze the eyelids.

Therefore, people should not turn small accidents into great tragedies. In the autumn of material hardship, the value of "optimism" can buy "achievements" and "happiness" that are not easily achieved with ten thousand taels of gold. The above example is just one aspect of this.

### The Psychology of Food: How to Satisfy Your Husband's Hunger?

— Paul

Everything is very advanced in America, and therefore, psychological research on all aspects of family life is emerging endlessly. It is said that if a husband has a casual attitude towards meals, it indicates that he is not very interested in food. According to psychologists, the food a person consumes has a significant relationship with their emotions. In recent years, although the theories of food nutrition have become increasingly advanced, the increasing divorce rate is alarming. The root cause is the improper cooking of food.

Vitamins and calories (the body heat generated by food) are the two main points that determine the nutritional value of food. However, American women have overlooked the following two points:

Men expend more heat daily than women due to their work.

Vitamins and calories are certainly essential for the body, but they do not have the power to stimulate appetite.

Not long ago, a gourmet association in New York held a test to investigate what men ultimately like to eat. The results showed that men love to eat meat, eggs, ham, beans, beef, cabbage, chicken, meatloaf, and stews.

American women, who constantly pay attention to their figure and strive to maintain a fixed weight, will naturally pale in comparison when they see this menu. Moreover, eating these expensive foods every day also poses a significant threat to the family budget. However, the truth is not that simple and difficult. There are several price points for meat, with some parts being cheaper than others. As long as it meets sanitary conditions, it is okay to buy the cheaper parts.

Some Americans believe that American men do not like their dishes to be too flavorful. In fact, that is not the case, because men often pick up their condiments—tomato paste—as soon as they sit down at the table. (Naturally, there is no need to worry about this in China, because Chinese cuisine is not as bland as Western cuisine.)

American women also have a concern that their husbands often do not like to eat vegetables. In fact, this is also a cooking problem. If cooked properly, even the most common vegetables can be very delicious.

American food experts have also discussed the issue of food temperature. It is said that the temperature of food has a great relationship with appetite. Foods that are suitable for hot eating should not be allowed to cool down before eating. Many women, in order to make the color of the dishes very appealing, spend a lot of effort decorating them with lemon slices and tomato slices after cooking. Although the color is beautiful, the taste of the food has been greatly damaged. In fact, for men, deliciousness is the first condition when eating, and aesthetic appearance is secondary.

Finally, American psychologists say that if a wife can attract her husband's attention through food, then he will pay attention to everything about his wife, indirectly leading to marital happiness. This is not only true in America, but also Chinese housewives should pay attention to this point.

### A Week of Home-Style Recipes

— Ms. Hua Ying

In the past half month, it has been difficult to buy foreign rice, and the price of local rice has soared. "It is difficult for a clever woman to cook without rice," which is really driving us housewives crazy. Not to mention rice, even cooking oil has become a problem, reaching ten yuan per catty, and we still have to queue up to buy it. Therefore, I am advocating a "save oil movement." When cooking, whether it is meat or vegetarian dishes, saving oil is the most important thing. Dishes that can be simply stir-fried should be changed to simple stir-frying, and avoid braising with oil and soy sauce. The recipes for the seven days of this week will be based on the principle of saving oil, with more simple stir-fries and clear stews included. Housewives, please pay attention.
