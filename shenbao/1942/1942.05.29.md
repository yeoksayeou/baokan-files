### Libyan Axis Forces Launch Large-Scale Offensive; Fierce Fighting Northeast of Bir Hakeim; Tobruk Heavily Bombed

Cairo, 27th (Havas) - The British Middle East Command has announced that a large unit of enemy armored vehicles arrived near Bir Hakeim last night and made contact with British forces. The progress of the battle is not yet known in detail. Military circles here believe this is the prelude to a large-scale offensive by the Axis powers in Libya. Bir Hakeim is located 40 miles south of El Gazala and is the most prominent British defense line on the Cyrenaica coast.

London, 28th (Reuters) - In North Africa, the Axis armored columns, ordered to advance last night, have divided into two routes and are now encountering strong resistance from British mechanized units. The main battle is reportedly taking place northeast of Bir Hakeim, where the Axis forces were once repelled. This afternoon's British Middle East communiqué stated that the fighting, which began in Libya yesterday morning, continued throughout the day. The Axis forces were divided into two main columns, engaging in fierce fighting with British armored forces northeast of Bir Hakeim over a wide area. The outcome is still unknown. The Axis armored attack on the Hakeim defenses was repelled with damage. Axis tanks approaching the British positions south of Gazala also suffered damage. The British positions remain unmoved. The British Air Force assisted in the battle throughout the day, attacking Axis troops and transport columns, and intercepting enemy aircraft attacking British forces.

Berlin, 27th (Havas) - Official sources here have announced that the German Air Force bombed British mechanized units near the port of Tobruk in North Africa last night, destroying many motorcycles. The port's docks were also heavily bombed.

Vichy, 28th (Havas) - The General Headquarters announced this morning that enemy troop and mechanized unit concentrations in North Africa were heavily bombed by Axis aircraft yesterday, causing significant losses. Airfields near Tobruk and railway facilities behind enemy lines were attacked. Our aircraft also continue to bomb Malta. British aircraft again raided Messina last night, causing slight damage to residential areas.

London, 28th (Havas) - Authorities here, based on news from Cairo, have expressed the opinion that the German offensive on the Libyan front is a large-scale offensive, not just part of a reconnaissance in force. This offensive will seriously threaten the British left flank.

### Soviet Forces in the Izyum Region Launch General Breakout

London, 28th (Reuters) - Today's German special communiqué announced a major victory for German and allied forces in the battle south of Kharkov, capturing over 185,000 Soviet soldiers. The communiqué released by Moscow today only stated that Soviet forces are currently consolidating their positions in front of Kharkov and fighting resolutely in the Izyum area. According to news received in the Swedish capital, it is widely believed that Soviet forces, in order to relieve the pressure on Soviet units south of Kharkov, launched a fierce attack northeast of Kharkov and have now reached the railway leading to Belgorod. German forces broke through Soviet defenses south of Kharkov, and Soviet General Timoshenko has now deployed a large force of about twelve divisions to launch a fierce counterattack.

Rome, 27th (Havas) - Three armies of the Red Army in the Izyum and Lozovaya regions southeast of Kharkov are trapped in a steel encirclement, facing a difficult situation. The Red Army authorities appear to have ordered their units to launch a general breakout. The Red Army's counterattack in the Torskoye-Novoselovka area is very fierce, with heavy losses on both sides. The German-Italian-Romanian allied forces are continuing their slow advance, as the fighting is extremely fierce. Although the encircled Red Army has lost contact with the main force, they are still fighting like trapped beasts in order to receive reinforcements and supplies. General Timoshenko, the commander of the Red Army on the southern front, intends to resist at all costs in the western corner of this pocket-shaped position until the troops break through and withdraw on the Donets front. The Red Army is offering the strongest resistance between Alekseyevskoye and Mikhailovka, as this area has abundant food and ammunition stores to sustain a prolonged defense. The German Air Force is constantly bombing these storage depots, but the results are unknown. Last night, the German forces tightened the encirclement, indicating that German General Bock has adopted a new strategy of destruction to save time. In essence, this involves ordering allied forces from all directions to advance simultaneously towards a central point in the pocket-shaped position, in order to divide the Red Army into several groups and complete the victory using local encirclement and annihilation tactics.

Berlin, 28th (Haitong News Agency) - The German High Command has issued a communiqué stating that the German army has won a major victory in the great battle south of Kharkov, capturing 165,000 enemy soldiers, 517 tanks, 1,180 artillery pieces, and thousands of motorcycles. Although a small number of trapped Soviet soldiers are still fighting stubbornly, they will be annihilated sooner or later.

Moscow, 28th (Reuters) - According to news received here, the Soviet Southern Front forces have occupied an important hilltop south of Kharkov and have expanded their bridgehead on the south bank of the Donets River, serving as a base for further offensives.

Moscow, 27th (Havas) -

The Red Army General Staff has issued a war report stating that on the 27th of this month, the Red Army on the Kharkov front is consolidating defensive works in the occupied positions and continuing to fight the enemy. In the Izyum area, enemy attacks were fiercely repelled by our forces, inflicting heavy damage. There is nothing else to report from other areas.

### Prime Minister Tojo Discusses Southern Construction: Consolidate Defense Foundation, Increase Economic Strength

Tokyo, 28th (Domei News Agency) - At the plenary session of the House of Representatives Budget Committee on the 28th, Prime Minister Tojo, in response to a question from Mr. Sanetatsu Yamazaki regarding southern construction, elucidated the basic principles of southern construction, the gist of which is as follows: The Greater East Asia War is necessary to complete the construction of Greater East Asia, and we must devote the efforts of the entire nation to this end. Therefore, the government has established the Greater East Asia Construction Deliberation Council to study the major plans for construction. The government's basic policy for constructing the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere displays the great ideal of "Eight Corners of the World Under One Roof," seeking the united cooperation of all nations and countries in East Asia. First, we must secure the defense foundation of Greater East Asia, and then further develop the characteristics of each region's human resources and materials to enrich and strengthen the economic strength of the entire Greater East Asia. The economic strength of each region within the Greater East Asia area should be mutually supportive to maximize comprehensive economic strength. This point is the foundation for defending the national defense strength of Greater East Asia, so it is especially necessary. All the people within the Co-Prosperity Sphere should share joys and sorrows and cooperate with each other. The above policies were decided by the Greater East Asia Construction Deliberation Council, and the government is also studying various promotion measures based on these policies.

Tokyo, 28th (Domei News Agency) - At the meeting of the House of Representatives Shipbuilding Law Bill Committee on the 28th, Minister Terashima explained the current state of Japanese shipping and shipbuilding as follows: At the time of the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, Japan's total shipping tonnage was 4 million tons for steamships and 7-800,000 tons for wooden ships and others. There have been annual increases since then. As for enemy ships, the United Kingdom had 10 million tons at the start of the war. The United States, excluding ships used in rivers and lakes, probably had less than 10 million tons that could be used at sea. Since the start of the war, the losses of enemy ships, although there are great differences between the figures announced by Germany and the United Kingdom, are generally 10 million tons for the United Kingdom and over 2 million tons for the United States. In today's world, there is a deep sense of the need to increase ships. As for the state of Japanese shipbuilding, we aim to complete the Greater East Asia War, establish East Asian co-prosperity, and ensure the transportation of materials. We are clarifying the number of ships sunk and wrecked, considering the capture of enemy ships, salvaging sunken ships, and leasing foreign ships, and deciding on shipbuilding. As for the annual shipbuilding volume, it is inconvenient to explain due to the ongoing war, but in order to ensure this plan, we have decided to implement the shipbuilding policies proposed this time.

Tokyo, 28th (Domei News Agency) - Today was the second day of the extraordinary session of the Diet, and various bills continued to be deliberated. The House of Representatives convened the Budget Committee at 9:14 AM, and Mr. Tatsunosuke Yamazaki represented the committee in questioning the government's administrative policies, to which the Prime Minister responded in detail, specifically clarifying the policies for constructing the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere and the direction of consolidating the domestic system. The three bills regarding the shipbuilding plan and their three budget bills were also passed without objection by the committee and the plenary session according to the government's original draft. After receiving these bills and budget bills, the House of Peers also responded to the House of Representatives, and after Minister of Finance Kaya delivered a speech on financial policy, they were deliberated. Various bills are expected to be completely deliberated today according to the planned schedule. Both houses have now completed their important task of assisting the Emperor. Thus, the 80th Extraordinary Session of the Diet declared its closure after clarifying the consistent policies of the Empire for constructing the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere to domestic and foreign audiences. The closing ceremony is scheduled for the 29th.

### Zhou Fohai Issues Statement Regarding Central Reserve Bank Notes

Nanjing, 27th (Domei News Agency) - Mr. Zhou Fohai issued a statement on the 27th, stating that prices are rising daily and life is becoming more difficult. The established policy is to promote the establishment of the Central Reserve Bank. In January of this year, emergency measures were taken to abolish the equal circulation of old and new currencies, which was only a temporary solution. However, the decline of the old currency has become more and more obvious. The current plan is to quickly designate the convertible notes issued by the Central Reserve Bank as the only currency in the provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, and the cities of Nanjing and Shanghai. Considering that the amount of old currency in circulation is large and represents the property of the people, it is specifically stipulated that Central Reserve Bank notes will be issued uniformly at a ratio of two to one against the old currency to facilitate reorganization. All disposal measures will be announced immediately.

Stockholm, 28th (Haitong News Agency) - Local newspapers report that well-informed sources in the United States speculate that British and American military leaders are currently in London discussing a plan to send a large number of aircraft to attack Germany.

Although this great war cannot determine the entire war situation, both sides want to try to create an equilibrium. This is obvious. "Also, the Daily News stated that the United Kingdom is determined to pressure Germany through aerial bombardment, and General Arnold's visit is certainly related to this issue. It is expected that only after the United States has solved the problem of supplying the United Kingdom with aircraft and the United States' food, ammunition, and gasoline are continuously transported to Europe can the United Kingdom continuously bomb Germany.

### German Giant Submarine Operates off the American Coast; Three More Allied Ships Sunk

Swiss Capital, 27th (Allied Telegraph)

### British Labour Party Congress Passes Motion to Maintain Political Truce, but Internal Rifts Still Exist

Swedish Capital, 28th (Haitong News Agency Telegraph)

According to Swedish newspapers, London reports that the British Labour Party's annual conference held a closed-door meeting yesterday and passed a motion to continue the political truce. Party members consider this a temporary victory for the party leaders, but they fear that the rifts between the party leaders and the members will widen. Whether the members and local party branches are willing to abide by this motion can be seen in the upcoming by-election campaigns.

Swedish Capital, 28th (Haitong News Agency Telegraph)

The British Labour Party Congress, on its third day yesterday, discussed the main issue of maintaining Britain's political compromise and party cooperation. Home Secretary Morrison put forward this proposal, but several left-wing Labour MPs, without waiting for Morrison to explain the reasons for the proposal, demanded that the motion be withdrawn. However, this request failed. A spokesman for the left wing stated that maintaining this kind of political compromise and party cooperation would result in the Labour Party gradually being absorbed by the Conservative Party. Morrison replied, "If the Labour Party adopts an uncooperative attitude and takes an opposing stance to the government, can it end the war and achieve victory sooner? Our answer is definitely no." As a result of the congress's discussion, the majority supported Morrison's proposal.

London, 27th (Havas Telegraph) The British Labour Party Congress today passed a plan to establish a national medical service association in Britain and implement a general social security system. U.S. Ambassador to Britain, Winant, attended the meeting as an observer today.

### Future of Relations Between Romania and Hungary

Swiss Capital, 27th (Havas Telegraph)

The future of relations between Romania and Hungary is extremely unstable, as the movement to recover lost territories in Romania is gaining momentum, while Hungary is maintaining silence on this. However, according to reports from the Hungarian capital, Hungary will soon state its position on the issue of Outer Transylvania. It is reported that the chairman of the Hungarian Veterans Association, Reviczky, gave a speech stating that any country in Europe that attempts to realize its ambitions by taking advantage of the troubles in Europe is indirectly harming Europe. This statement is likely referring to Romania's demand to recover lost territories. In addition, the Hungarian Foreign Minister is concurrently held by Prime Minister Kállay, which shows the Hungarian government's emphasis on this matter. Furthermore, the Hungarian Minister to Romania, Szente-Keöszeg, has returned home to report on the political situation in Romania, which is also noteworthy.

### 2. Outline of Turkey (2) Regeneration and Construction

Since the Second Balkan War, Turkey, which had been languishing in decline, suddenly showed a glimmer of hope from its state of extreme weakness. Here, we must calculate this account clearly. We think that rather than saying Turkey escaped death, it would be better to say that the old Ottoman Empire had died, as it was a "sick man" anyway, and "Turkey for the Turks" was born at this very moment, neither sooner nor later. This child, to say something auspicious, can be called a fast-growing, beloved child. In the short span of sixteen years (from the establishment of the National Assembly government in Ankara in 1920 to the Montreux Convention in 1936), this newborn calf actually created a glorious history and built a brand-new Turkey. Although this new Turkey is only one-fifth the size of the Ottoman Empire, we must know that the old Ottoman Empire was all obtained by the old Ottomans through stealing, grabbing, and aggression. How could it be a family business to build a strong nation? Let's take a look at what stage of construction this Turkey for the Turks has reached.

Among these brand-new constructions, we can immediately grasp a most enviable viewpoint, which is "liberation" in everything. Among all the liberations, the first that calls our attention is the "People's Houses." The so-called People's Houses are a type of popular education organization, somewhat similar to our country's popular education centers, but with a broader connotation and scope. In Turkey, these People's Houses are located throughout major cities, small towns, and villages. Wherever there are people, there is the establishment of such houses. The organization of the houses includes various activities, such as sports, exercise, rural improvement research, art exploration and exhibitions, drama art research, concerts, dance parties (not comparable to our country's brothel-turned-dance halls), reading rooms, domestic affairs discussions, museums, and various knowledge studies, etc. Every citizen has the right and obligation to participate in the houses.

This view of the People's Houses also has a special advantage. We know that in the old Ottoman "sick man" era, the knowledge of the people was extremely backward, with illiteracy accounting for more than 90 percent. Since the establishment of the new Turkey, compulsory school education has been implemented. The intellectual progress of children is rapid. Then wouldn't middle-aged and elderly men and women who are past school age or have never attended school be completely behind the times? Here lies the special advantage of the People's Houses; any men and women who have not attended school, as long as they participate in the People's Houses, can learn to read and write unconsciously, and various knowledge will also make considerable progress. They seem to be competing with the children in schools in the field of knowledge.

Secondly, what we can see is the liberation of religion. The Ottoman Empire was established on the basis of Islam, so Islam is a state religion in Turkey. After the "New Deal" began, although the towering Islamic minarets still exist everywhere, freedom of religion is now a reality. Initially, in Turkey, there were general Islamic leaders who would climb to the top of the Islamic minarets every morning, noon, and evening, and make a deep call, announcing that the time for prayer had arrived; as soon as the people heard this call, they had to immediately prostrate themselves in worship. Currently, this call is still sent out on time, but most of the people who send it out are not the muezzins in charge, but rather broadcast through loudspeakers, like Shanghai broadcasting the standard time. As for the people who hear this call, most of them do what they are doing and do not feel the religious mystery of the past. Christianity, Catholicism, etc., have gradually penetrated this Islamic country.

What interests us most is the liberation of Turkish women. Fourteen or fifteen years ago, if you traveled to Turkey, you simply couldn't see the faces of women; what a disappointing thing that was. Just like in our country in ancient times, men and women were not allowed to sit at the same table after the age of seven, and all Turkish women had to wear a head covering. Today, this kind of head covering can only be seen in antique displays; today's women not only don't have to cover their faces, but on the contrary, you can often see young and energetic female students in the suburbs of major cities, wearing snow-white flight uniforms, practicing gliding or taking flight exams.

In Turkey, we can see freedom of speech in books, newspapers, magazines, and meeting speeches. They have a variety of daily newspapers; they also use new-style typesetting machines. The most widely sold daily newspaper is the "Tan" newspaper. This name, when translated, means dawn.

As for the deposits of various Chinese commercial banks in China and Communications Banks, as well as the deposits of China and Communications Banks in British banks such as HSBC and Mercantile Bank, it is also heard that a concrete solution has been negotiated. Therefore, the overall financial situation will tend to stabilize. However, the Shanghai branch of the Central Bank and the Shanghai branch of the China Farmers' Bank have been closed and liquidated.

### Return Home Certificates and Passes Suspended Yesterday; Expected to Resume Issuance Today

Yesterday (May 28th), the Municipal Council suspended the issuance of return home passes and temporary passes. It is heard that the reason was that the citizens who received certificates in the previous few days were particularly crowded, resulting in a shortage of these two types of certificates. According to a report by the Datong News Agency, the office has already resumed the process of receiving [applications], so it may be possible to obtain them today and continue issuing them. As for the other offices, they were also suspended yesterday and may resume issuing them simultaneously today to facilitate the evacuation work.

### New Organization of the Municipal Council That Solves All Problems (8) The Future of the People of Shanghai Will Be Decided in Their Hands

Four Million Two Hundred Thousand Customers

"You say the lines for milling rice are packed outside the rice shops? But everywhere in the world there are such lines outside stores… Why should Shanghai be any different? At least people here are actually getting some rice – and more than anywhere else. Besides, I have a hope that in the short term, Shanghai may no longer have milling lines…"

The speaker was Mr. Lecky, head of the Municipal Council's Rice Bureau. He had just finished a heavy day of work and was now taking time to explain to a reporter a glimpse of the work in his department and the major tasks they encounter daily and handle nimbly.

"We have more than two million people to maintain supply," he gradually got to the topic. "I might as well tell you, this is indeed a big undertaking… Let's start from the beginning… The rice problem encountered by the Municipal Council is really a complex and difficult one, and it has been even more difficult since the East Asian War. From May to December, the Municipal Council imported the rice needed by the entire city and sold this imported rice at a fair price to control the food situation.

"But the war changed all of this. From then on, the problem that the Municipal Council should grasp is how to obtain the rice that is available locally to feed the people of the city… This is another completely different difficult problem.

Requisition of Rice Stock

"The Municipal Council's own rice stock was quickly used up," the head of the Rice Bureau continued. "So, the only way is for the Municipal Council to requisition all the stock that it can. Proceeding according to the principle of 'buying from those who have rice and distributing it fairly to everyone'… This is how the Municipal Council is still continuing to feed the entire population today. Of course, the rice that Shanghai relied on to survive for the past three months cannot be inexhaustible, but when the rice stock runs out, the authorities in charge will find ways to supply the needed food."

Returning to the original topic, the inside story of the current rice situation in Shanghai is extremely interesting and thought-provoking. Here is the whole story, starting from the beginning…

### Three Japanese Factories Supply Flour to Be Allocated by the Municipal Council; Continued Supply Will Be Made Monthly

The Municipal Council's Flour Control Office is currently continuing to allocate flour from Taikoo Wharf to various flour product manufacturers, with a daily total of about 4,000 bags. At the same time, it is heard that the Japanese flour mills Sanxing, Dongfu, and Huayou have also supplied flour produced by them to the Municipal Council for allocation. The first batch is said to be several tens of thousands of bags. It is said that these three Japanese factories will continue to supply flour every month. It is also reported that since the complete adoption of the ration card system for the sale of bread, not only have the bread lines disappeared, but the supply situation is extremely smooth. Major food stores on Nanjing Road have a large number of bread displays in the windows every day, with few customers, presenting a state of oversupply. It is said that since the inclusion of 20% corn flour in the raw materials for bread making, the quality and taste have been slightly inferior to before, which is also a factor in reducing the number of consumers.

### Employer Sentenced to Eight Years for Enticing and Abusing a Young Girl

Yao Gang, a local who made a fortune by speculating and hoarding goods during the war, recently established the Xiexing Pawnshop at No. 19 Laian Lane, Baoshan Road, Zhabei. He hired a Shaoxing girl, Cao Gendi (15 years old, according to her birthday, which is May 24th of the lunar calendar, she is still not of marriageable age, only 14 years old). At 7:30 a.m. on the 3rd of this month, Yao instructed Cao to send a washed handkerchief to his residence on the upper floor of No. 15 Gengfu Lane, North Jiangxi Road, in the Public Concession,

### A Word (1)

— Lao Zhang

Rice prices are soaring every moment. I am still teaching at ×× Middle School, receiving a monthly salary plus allowances of 240 yuan in legal tender. Supporting a family of seven is really difficult. As soon as the 240 yuan is in hand, buying coal means no money for rice, and buying rice makes daily expenses a problem. My wife grumbles at me every night, saying that so-and-so made a fortune through speculation, and so-and-so's income from hoarding goods is considerable, urging me to think of a way and find a new avenue. It's really no wonder she feels that way.

One night, after discussing it, we decided to visit an old classmate of mine who has been quite successful recently, asking him to help me with some business.

The next day, I took leave from school, changed into a relatively neat outfit, and headed straight to my old friend's M office.

M's office was on the third floor of a large building on Nanjing Road, the most bustling street in Shanghai. Although it was only a small room, it was decorated exceptionally luxuriously. When I entered, M was sitting at a large desk, answering the phone. Three or five guests were lounging on the surrounding sofas, seemingly waiting for him.

M was wearing a smart new suit. I hadn't seen him for half a year, and he looked much fatter. His face was clean-shaven and shiny, like satin. He hung up the phone, saw me at a glance, and, while holding a cigar in his mouth, said vaguely:

"Lao Zhang, long time no see! It's rare for you to come by."

Before he finished speaking, the phone rang again.

"Hello, Da Fa Bank, what? You want to change to Tao Kuining? We have the goods, but the price isn't right. 2400 yuan at most! 2200? No deal, no deal!" He hung up the phone with a thud.

"Lao Zhang, how have you been lately?..."

Another ring.

"Hello, what? Military notes at 13.5 yuan? Savings certificates at 3.4 yuan? Okay, buy 50,000 yuan worth of savings certificates for me! Send the money over immediately!"

At this moment, the guests on the sofas jumped up in unison. M sat calmly in his swivel chair, blowing smoke up into the air, repeatedly saying, "The market is changing drastically."

××××

After all, he was an old friend. M treated me to a lavish "simple meal." There was wine and meat, and having "not tasted meat for three months," I couldn't help but become "both drunk and full."

There were five people in total at the table. When we sat down, M introduced them to me one by one:

"This is Manager Huang, from Jiu Da Trading Company; this is Peng Jugong, representative of AK Pharmaceutical Factory; this is Wu Zulao, Assistant Manager of ×× Bank."

Then it was my turn to be introduced:

"This is Mr. Zhang, a teacher at ×× Middle School. My old classmate."

"Ah, I've heard so much about you. Being a teacher is the most noble profession," Wu Zulao said listlessly, looking elsewhere.

### Rice Shops Must Strictly Observe Queuing System

Bureau's purchase price of rice revised to 608 yuan

The Public Concession Police, in order to maintain order in the rice queuing system, has posted a notice in front of the rice shops stating that anyone who disobeys police orders at the rice buying locations, or who does not stand in line according to the prescribed position, or who intentionally squeezes into the queuing line, or who incites others to commit the above acts, will be arrested and severely punished.

Price Changes Again

According to a report by the Datong News Agency, the Shanghai Municipal Council's Rice and Grain Management Committee has increased the selling price of whole bags of rice to rice shops to 576 yuan. Starting today, it will be changed again to 608 yuan, which is consistent with the retail market price of rice.

### French Concession Police Conduct Terror Drill

The French Concession Police Department conducted a terror drill yesterday afternoon at approximately 4:00 PM, in the area bounded by Avenue Albert to the east, Route Ratard to the west, Avenue Lafayette to the south, and Route de Cercle to the north, in Section 176 of the Foch District of the Baojia system. During that time, roads such as Avenue Lafayette, Avenue Albert, and Route de Cercle were temporarily closed. The drill lasted for one hour before it concluded.

### Private Hospitals Must Have Permits for Injections

The Datong News Agency reports that from now on, citizens who request vaccinations from private hospitals must pay attention to whether the other party has obtained a registered permit for vaccination from the Shanghai Municipal Council for this year. Otherwise, even if the citizen is vaccinated by the doctor, they will not be able to exchange the doctor's certificate for a formal certificate issued by the Shanghai Municipal Council.

### Qianghua Football Team Defeats Xuhui 6-3, Today to Battle Hequn

The Qianghua football expedition team played against the Xuhui small football team at the Xuhui Stadium yesterday afternoon at 6:00 PM, with over a thousand spectators. At the beginning of the match, the two sides were evenly matched. Qianghua only scored a goal by Gao Baozheng at the twelfth minute. Afterwards, neither side achieved much. The first half ended with Qianghua leading 1-0. After switching sides, Qianghua gradually became active, while Xuhui's Yu Liming, who played despite being ill, had difficulty performing well.

### Early Summer at the Lotus Pond

The plum rain season is a mix of overcast and sunny weather, the prelude to the hot summer. Those confined to the city, faced with this oppressive weather, seem to have only the park as an escape. Whether in the early morning dew or when the evening glow paints the river, sitting alone by the pond, gazing up and down, is enough to dispel worldly troubles. In the picture on the left, the pond is as clear as a mirror, and the lotus leaves spread out, refreshing the spirit.

Chronicle

Market Feature

### Active People

— Li Jitong

The elevator stopped on the fourth floor, and a batch of gold diggers squeezed out, rushing into the market. It was a space made up of four rooms. Stepping inside, a pungent smell of sweaty odor assailed the nostrils. If you weren't used to such air, you would feel suffocated. Although the windows on both sides of the room were wide open, and more than a dozen ceiling fans were constantly whirring, in this stuffy early summer weather, with more than a hundred people crammed into one room, shouting loudly, the air was unbearable. The loud shouting and the incessant ringing of more than forty telephone bells made one suspect that they had walked into a machine room in a factory.

Looking inside from the entrance of the market, one could see white shirts swaying in a sea of black hair. On the four walls, like pigeonholes, were countless telephones. From the ground, there were five or six steps leading up to the telephones (because they were placed at a height of one person plus a raised hand). Many men resembling brokers stood on the steps, one foot raised, a telephone receiver in one hand and a cigarette in the other, sometimes shouting, "×× Company buys 20 bags of Longtou rice, 420 yuan." From 10:30 to 12:00 in the morning, and from 2:00 to 4:00 in the afternoon, although it was only a few short hours, their extravagant lives depended on it, and the market conditions and prices outside fluctuated with their actions.

"Longtou rice, 420." "Pi Junzi, 15.5 yuan, Caiqiu, 380." Several people shouted loudly in the center of the market, and many people gathered from all directions to respond: "410, will you sell?" "×× Company buys five boxes of Four Gentlemen." If all parties were willing to make a deal, they would clap their hands together, signifying the agreement. Tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of dollars were decided in this one clap! The fate of the gold diggers—success or failure—was also decided in this one clap! When the two sides were clapping, a "blocker" waiting nearby would quickly write down the names of the shops and the amount of the transaction in a small notebook, making three copies. Each side kept one copy, and one copy was left in the market for record keeping.

Next to a telephone, a man picked up the receiver and said, "Boss Zhang, Longtou rice is being offered at 435. Do you want to buy in? It looks like the market will rise further!" Judging by his expression, he knew that the boss thought the price was too high and was unwilling to buy in. So he had an idea, and covered the bottom of the receiver with one hand, turned his head, and winked at several companions waiting below. They all squeezed to the side of the receiver and shouted loudly, "Longtou rice is being bought at 440! Buying in at 440!" The man, in the midst of their noise, released his hand, put it to his ear, and said, "Boss Zhang, listen, someone is already buying in at 440. The market is definitely going to rise, right? Buy 100 bags? 100 bags!" He cheerfully put down the receiver and shouted to a fellow who was shouting "Longtou rice, 420 yuan," "×× Company is buying 100 bags." Then he clapped his hand. The "blocker" next to him was already writing it down.

"That's not right, there's something fishy!" "Everyone should get a share," the guy standing next to a telephone said to the man.

"Okay, 100 yuan for each person." He generously extended a finger, and everyone said nothing more.

"Longtou rice is being sold at 422!" another man shouted loudly.

"×× Company is buying 20 bags." A man stretched out his hand, wanting to clap, but someone squeezed out from the side and clapped him: "×× Company, 425 yuan!"

"What! You..." The man who was selling 20 bags was not convinced and started arguing, "I was buying in first, damn it, you..." "What's up?" The other party was unwilling to be outdone. So the two sides started yelling, and the companions of both sides gathered around to mediate, shouting "Okay!" "Okay!" But it still couldn't be resolved, and dozens of families were fighting with each other.

After a moment, the dispute was resolved, and everyone was shouting loudly again, blending with the ringing of the telephone bells.

When it was time to leave the market, everyone was covered in sweat. The losers were crestfallen, and the winners were cheerful. They all walked out of the room and discovered that their white leather shoes were covered in black shoe prints.

Day after day, their lives were always spent in such intense activity.

### Bitterness and Joy

— Wu Xia

Do you want happiness? You must first suffer.

The sweetness of happiness can only be brewed from bitterness.

Those who have never suffered will never have happiness. Only by suffering and tasting the taste of bitterness can one understand happiness, can one understand the preciousness of happiness.

Bitterness is the seed of joy, and joy is the result of bitterness.

Understanding bitterness also means understanding joy. Those who can endure bitterness will surely be able to enjoy happiness!

### Sharing the Same Boat

— He Jia Zhi

(5) Repaying Kindness

Under a dim light, Wei Cheng and Guoqi sat slumped down. Guoqi suddenly walked to Wei Cheng's bedside and asked, "I don't hear any noise outside. Have your family members all gone to sleep?" Wei Cheng said, "In my family, only Sister Cuizhen stays up late. However, she suffered some stimulation today and is not feeling well. Although she got up as usual later to take care of some chores, I think she couldn't hold on and must have gone to sleep earlier. I heard the magpies say that Guofang and she are sleeping in the same room, in the northwest corner of the rear courtyard. Guofang must have forced her to sleep. Guofang and Sister Cuizhen hit it off as soon as they met, not unlike you and me. This is also a chance encounter. What do you mean by asking that question?" Guoqi got onto Wei Cheng's bed, sat cross-legged facing him, and smiled. "Tonight, since you've kept me here, I'll tell you tonight. Otherwise, I was thinking of keeping it until you came to Shanghai to tell you. Guofang, what do you think?" Wei Cheng said, "Why are you asking such a senseless question? Guofang is accompanying Sister Cuizhen in the same room." Guoqi said, "Don't pretend to be oblivious. A person should observe others closely. I've noticed that during the New Year, Guofang wanted to come to your place. Do you know how many times she said it at home in Shuangqiao? In front of my grandmother and in front of me, I secretly counted for her. She said it thirteen times in total. Later, after coming to your place, when she returned to Shuangqiao, I asked her, 'Is the house in Wei Cheng's family still good?' She said, 'It's tall and bright, elegant and refined, the air is fresh, and the light is abundant.' She even recited the total number of rooms, how many large rooms, and how many small rooms. I asked about the house, and she told me about the land. I asked about the owner, and she told me about the servants. It can be said that she has no complaints about your family. She also went to tell my grandmother that she wanted to live in the countryside permanently and didn't want to study in Shanghai anymore. Later, after arriving in Shanghai, she would call almost every two or three days. Of course, there were other things to talk about on the phone, but in the end, she would always ask me when I planned to go to Wei Cheng's house. This time, in addition to sending funeral scrolls and elegiac couplets, she also insisted on sending 100 yuan. From these things, I know that her feelings for you can be described as passionate. Wei Cheng, would you like her to become a daughter-in-law of the Ye family?" Wei Cheng had been unwilling to interrupt Guoqi's words. When it came to the conclusion, Guoqi asked such a question. Wei Cheng stared at Guoqi, and then slowly said, "I think it may be too early to say, don't you think?" (88)

### Closing Early

— Jin Yi

One day, walking along Avenue Joffre, it was at most 5 o'clock (new time), but some department stores were already closed. Some nightclubs and the like had requested the Concession authorities to extend business hours, wanting to do more business, but because their request was denied, they changed "extending" to "advancing," inventing the "Spiritual Morning Dance." With the same rent and the same expenses, apart from the foreign rules of opening at 8:00 AM and closing at 6:00 PM, and resting all day on Saturday afternoons and Sundays, Chinese shops always had "early markets" and "night markets." Avenue Joffre originally relied on these department stores to maintain the night market. Closing at 5 o'clock would only make this "mysterious street" even more "mysterious"!

Who knew that the "skills" of merchants were even more mysterious? Since a certain company "secretly profited" during its closure period, it had invented the "selling less, earning more" technique in its business. For example, "one item per person" is one of these techniques. However, "selling less, earning more" still involves selling something, which is not as good as closing early, "not selling, earning big." Does this mean that they will never open? That's not the case. They open as usual the next day, but the prices have already been changed. This trend doesn't seem to be a one-time thing. It will probably be staged again in the future, anyway, it's just a wave of the hand!

### Life and Mountain Climbing

— Yuan Ying

Life is like climbing a mountain. You must first have a firm desire to reach the summit, otherwise, you will never climb the mountain. But if you only think, only knowing that you are dissatisfied with standing in the valley, you still will not reach the summit. Or, if you only leisurely look at the grandeur and greatness of the summit, and only imagine that you have already arrived there, then you will never reach it. You must summon your courage and strive forward.

But if you suddenly get excited and rush upwards without regard for the rocks and streams ahead, then you will not achieve your goal either. Therefore, a wise person always draws up a route at the beginning, following the route from their current valley to the summit they want to reach. They set up many small goals along the way, actively striving towards the nearest goal, because this can be achieved in a short time. When they reach this small goal, they feel that they have made progress and are happy. Then they rest for a while and summon their courage again, setting up a second goal and moving towards it.

The ultimate goal of the summit may be far away, only faintly visible, and sometimes even completely invisible. But whether you see it or not, what you should always pay attention to is the small goal in front of you—how to cross the rocks, how to jump over the streams, how to climb over the foot of the mountain, how to avoid falling from the cliffs into the abyss. The ultimate goal is only like a compass, indicating that you will not lose your way, and how to climb the mountain is up to your own efforts. Because of the difference in effort, some people overcome many difficulties and cross many obstacles, finally being able to sing loudly on the summit, howling fearlessly in the wind. But others can only forever stand at the foot of the mountain, looking up at the summit, forever only thinking about the summit.

### Miscarriage

— Zhong Wenling

"Her body is already weak, and the fetus is not even ten weeks old yet," the obstetrician explained repeatedly.

The future protagonist, who was about to be born and whose name had already been chosen, suddenly "miscarried." How could one not be angry! I was about to completely settle the matter with the hospital—such as compensation—when a nurse said faintly, "I've never seen such an unreasonable person. What does a miscarriage count for? We didn't cause it. The mother's life has been saved, what else are you complaining about?"

Coming out of the hospital, I was still somewhat angry, but as I ran and thought, I gradually felt relieved. Returning home and sitting on the chair, I actually felt somewhat happy. Recalling my fierce appearance in the hospital, I found it a bit ridiculous.

Statistics are rare in our country. According to a report by a certain insurance company in the United States, the average amount of money spent on a child from birth to the age of eighteen is approximately 6,500 US dollars. If converted into legal currency, it may not be a standard, so let's not mention it, but it is still a considerable amount. Just one "safe delivery" costs 500 yuan.

It goes without saying that children born at this time and place are congenitally deficient. Although congenital deficiencies can be made up for later, such as having the amount and timing of all diet and living arrangements planned by doctors or experts, completely scientific; and hiring five nannies to take turns day and night, implementing according to the planned schedule, such as: give milk at 3:05; play and breathe fresh air at 4:30; give milk again at 5:20; urinate at 5:35...

But how many little darlings have such good fortune?

Since they are congenitally deficient and cannot be properly nurtured later, the chance of such children dying young is 50%. It should be known that dying young is much more heartbreaking than a miscarriage. Conversely, a miscarriage is always quicker than dying young. It's better not to come out, miscarry, miscarry!

### Truth

— Chao

Although time is precious, truth is even more precious.

Although the appearance of truth is beautiful, the clothes she wears are coarse.

Although truth can be suppressed, it cannot be killed.

A thousand assumptions are not enough to create one truth.

Although truth may decline, it does not die.

Truth is a bitter food.

Truth is the most simple and honest thing of all.

The essence of truth is only simplicity and clarity.

Intellect makes us pursue truth, and passion makes us engage in labor.

Truth is better than everything.

### Spot Yarn Weak, Shuang Ma Factory Orders Increasingly Soft

The cotton yarn market returned to weakness, due to the slight stabilization of the premium for Central Reserve Certificates, which calmed people's minds.

This market fluctuated for quite some time, rising slightly to 9,600 yuan in the middle, but later, due to the weakness of spot yarn and the liquidation of long positions, the market slowly declined to 9,100 yuan at the close.

### Cloth Goods Suddenly Loosen

Cotton Cloth: Yesterday's market saw a slight calming of public sentiment due to the decline in spot exchange premiums and the stabilization of the Central Reserve Bank notes.

Woolen Goods Industry Also Sells Reserves

Yesterday, the retail and wholesale prices of woolen goods were uniformly changed to selling reserve certificates, according to a notice from the industry association. Shops on Chessboard Street took the lead in changing their price tags. Prices previously marked at 50 yuan per foot in old currency were now uniformly marked at 35 yuan per foot in reserve certificates. If customers paid with the old legal tender, it was decided to temporarily use a ratio of   to  for pricing, pending further negotiation of the official exchange rate from June   onward. Transactions were uniformly conducted in cash, using the reserve certificate price tags as the standard.

### ### Category A Bonds Hit the Limit Down

In the over-the-counter market for public bonds, the selling pressure did not abate yesterday. However, observing the tendency of various bonds to rise again after falling suggests that the bulls are still fighting hard and gradually gaining strength. Although Category A bonds hit the limit down, the buying appetite remained strong, as large investors continued to sell, particularly Categories A and B. For the time being, the bulls were intimidated by the sellers' momentum, but they did not show signs of discouragement. If the sellers relax their bullish pressure even slightly, the rebound will be very strong, because many people follow the trend when prices fall, and there are too many speculative short positions, so the reaction will be rapid. We should wait and see. Yesterday, Yu Da opened the market by buying, followed by Xinji, Runde, and Guangliang absorbing the bonds. Shunli, Lianyi, Chengkang, and Hengyu also bought aggressively. Category E bonds were supported by Hengfu acting on behalf of a certain firm to absorb them, which helped to hold up the market price. Tongli and Tongkang sold more, while Hu Heji, Dechang, Tongyuan, Shuntai, Hongda, Jiufeng, Zhongfu, Xinhua, and various retail investors sold one after another. Among them, few bulls closed their positions; most were selling in line with the trend. As a result, except for Category A bonds, which fell by 4 yuan, hitting the limit down, the rest fell by only 1.3 to 2.6 yuan, while Category E bonds fell by only 0.1 yuan. The total transaction volume was approximately 3.4 to 3.5 million yuan. A summary table is listed below.

Vermicelli and bean noodles were originally priced very steadily due to seasonal factors, but recent drastic financial changes have caused prices to flourish instead. Firms uniformly called up prices by over 100  , presenting a lively and profitable appearance.

### Cigarette Prices Difficult to Revert

The cigarette market opened lively yesterday. Public sentiment remained difficult to dissipate due to financial rumors. Continuing the momentum from the previous day, all goods maintained their steady strength. While the rumors proved false and the market atmosphere relaxed, with ample spot supplies, public sentiment and perception differed, making it difficult for selling prices to fall back.

### High Prices Difficult to Sustain, Firewood and Soap All Trending Down

Selling prices of daily necessities rose sharply recently due to the severe financial volatility, with general speculators taking advantage of the situation to raise prices. However, actual sales were sluggish, making it difficult to sustain the high prices. Therefore, prices are still trending downwards. Gu Ben soap was 480 yuan per box, White Xiang Mao soap was 430 yuan, Yellow Xiang Mao soap was 375 yuan, and Arrow Knife soap was 400 yuan, all seeing a decline of over 10 yuan. Matches are bound to follow suit because the army ticket goods consigned by the local industry have already arrived. The price is still 0.5 yuan in army tickets, and the quantity is still limited. Therefore, over-the-counter prices are trending back down. Phoenix brand was 6,500 yuan, Beauty brand was 6,700 yuan, and miscellaneous brands were 5,200 yuan, all falling by around 300 yuan.
