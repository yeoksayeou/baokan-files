London, May 31st, Reuters Dispatch: The Soviet Information Bureau announced last night that the Soviet offensive in the Kharkov area was aimed at preventing the German offensive on the Rostov front and their plan to seize the Caucasus.

Some time ago, the Soviet High Command learned of the German commanders' plans for a major offensive by Axis forces in the Rostov front area. The Germans concentrated 30 infantry divisions, six tank divisions, and a large number of artillery units and aircraft in this area. In order to prevent this plan and strike a blow against the Axis forces, the Soviets launched an offensive in the Kharkov area. Occupying Kharkov was not part of the Soviet commander's plan. Fierce battles have been taking place in this area for two weeks and are now nearing completion. The main task predetermined by the Soviet commander, to strike a blow against the Axis forces, has been fulfilled. At the same time, it is reported that bloody battles are still ongoing around Kharkov. Moscow radio reports that Soviet forces have broken into half of a certain city on the Kharkov front, and fierce street fighting is underway.

### Italian Foreign Minister Elucidates Diplomatic Policy

Rome, May 31st, Huitong News Agency Dispatch: Italian Foreign Minister Ciano delivered a speech to the Senate Finance Committee yesterday, elucidating the basic principles of Italian foreign policy. He briefly stated that Italy's policy towards Britain is to wage war against the British Empire anytime, anywhere. The United States formally entered the war six months ago, but in reality, the United States has not been a neutral country for the past two years. Nominal neutrality was merely a cover for supporting Britain. The Pan-American Conference in the capital of Brazil produced no results. Italy's friendly relations with Argentina and Chile are increasingly strengthened. Argentina and Chile are both able to maintain an independent foreign policy. Ciano continued to discuss relations with the Soviet Union, stating that Mussolini felt the need to organize an anti-Soviet front during the Spanish Civil War. The current war is a war to defend against Bolshevism, and whether the culture closely related to Italian life can continue to be maintained will be determined by the outcome of the war. The Italian army has fought bravely and achieved victories, and will make even greater contributions. The Balkan countries are of decisive importance to Italy's interests. Through diplomatic and military steps in 1940 and 1941, Italy has united with the countries of Southeastern Europe. After the collapse of Yugoslavia in the war against the Soviet Union, Mussolini decided on the following principles: 1. To resolve the Adriatic Sea issue and guarantee Italy's control over the Adriatic Sea. 2. To establish the complete autonomy of Montenegro. 3. To define the territory of Albania. 4. Close cooperation between Italy and Croatia. Greece lacks food, and all developments are hindered. Italy has taken various measures to alleviate Greece's difficulties. Politically, the situation is very calm due to the activities of the Italian military and civil administration. The Albanian people's attitude towards the Italo-Greek war is admirable. Albania has the greatest confidence. After Albania annexed Yugoslav territory, its population increased by 800,000 people. Ciano reviewed the relationship between France and Italy after the armistice, believing that the relationship between France and Italy was very harmonious. Italy also maintains friendly relations with countries such as Turkey, Switzerland, and Spain. Spain has expressed a friendly attitude in the current war. Ciano strongly emphasized the continued cooperation between Germany and Italy. Although the battlefields are scattered in various places, it is still a common war. The common plan of the three countries has been manifested in the Eastern Front, North Africa, the Mediterranean, East Asia, and the Pacific. The war will continue. Although the enemy is resisting stubbornly, they will encounter even more tough fighting troops. This fighting spirit is the best guarantee of victory.

### Great Reduction in Automobile Travel in the United States Due to Shortage of Gasoline and Rubber

London, May 30th, Havas News Agency Dispatch: Although automobile travel within the country has been greatly reduced due to the shortage of gasoline, according to the latest statistics, the number of people killed and injured due to traffic accidents is still high. In April, 565 people died and 2,000 were injured. In April 1941, only 161 people died.

New York, May 30th, Havas News Agency Dispatch: Business circles here recently stated that at least two-thirds of all private cars in the United States will disappear within two years due to the rubber shortage. Experts estimate that the tires used by automobiles on American highways total one million tons. Although gasoline rationing has been implemented, daily consumption is still no less than 600 tons. Furthermore, economic experts stated that major changes are about to occur in the American economic structure due to the shortage of daily necessities such as rubber, gasoline, and sugar. Rubber is very important to the automobile industry and automobile transportation industry, and the rubber shortage is not a temporary phenomenon. Unless synthetic rubber can be produced in large quantities, this problem will not be solved in the very short term. President Roosevelt recently told the press that synthetic rubber will soon be able to replace natural rubber.

### Hitler Encourages Young Military Officers

The German Head of State began by using lessons from German history to give the young officers maxims for their work. The experiences of last winter's war proved that true leaders must have perseverance and the ability to overcome difficulties. The German Head of State finally asked the young officers to remember that their attitude on the front line is tied to the fate of Germany. Therefore, German officers and their subordinates, whether in combat or at rest, must always keep Germany's hopes in mind.

### Coal Shortage in France, No Hope for Resolution of Railway Transportation Problems

Clermont-Ferrand, May 31st, Havas News Agency Dispatch: The railways in northeastern France are difficult to repair due to war damage. There is no way to travel between central France and Paris. Furthermore, due to the lack of imported coal, trains run very infrequently. The authorities have banned people from traveling by train for sightseeing. Currently, trains are mostly used to transport food. The extent of railway restrictions can be seen from the following figures: Before the war, trains traveled 400,000 miles per month. Last year, this was reduced to 100,000 miles, and now it has been reduced to 90,000 miles. In 1941, the number of freight cars running on the railways was only 79% of the number in 1938. Currently, due to the lack of coal, there is no hope for a resolution to the railway transportation problem. The government is now planning to use electric locomotives to replace existing steam locomotives in order to save fuel.

### Silver and Banking Industries Held a Meeting Yesterday to Discuss the Legal Tender Issue: Public Notice Clarifies that Reports of Banks Closing and Restricting Withdrawals Starting June 1st Are Inaccurate

The Shanghai Silver and Banking Association held a special meeting to discuss the Nanjing government's announcement regarding the exchange of legal tender for Central Reserve Bank notes. The details of the meeting are outlined below:

Meeting Details

The temporary joint committee of silver and banking industry members convened an emergency meeting at the Hong Kong Road Banking Association at 5:00 PM yesterday. Over eighty individuals were present, including Wu Yunzhai, Ye Fuxiao, Wang Boyuan, Qu Jigang, Zhu Boquan, Lu Shuchen, and Wang Huaikang. The chairman began by reporting the purpose of the meeting, followed by resolutions on various measures to be implemented. The meeting adjourned around 7:00 PM. The resolutions were as follows: Starting June 1st, all debts and credits between banks and firms prior to May 31st would be converted at a ratio of two to one, using Central Reserve Bank notes as the standard. Specifically: (1) Old legal tender cash deposits at all banks and firms would be converted to Central Reserve Bank note cash deposits at a ratio of two to one. (2) Old legal tender current account deposits would be converted to Central Reserve Bank note current account deposits at a ratio of two to one. Before June 7th, those repaying debts with old legal tender would be limited to the old legal tender issued by the Central Bank of China and the Bank of Communications, according to regulations. Old legal tender bearing place names other than Shanghai, and old notes issued by other banks, would not be accepted. Lastly, the association spokesperson solemnly declared to reporters: "The recent rumors circulating in the market regarding the silver and banking industries closing for three days, restricting withdrawals, and requiring depositors to purchase public bonds are absolutely inaccurate," as officially clarified by the responsible authorities. (The association's public notice can be found in today's advertisements.)

Content of the Announcement

Briefly stated, the banknotes issued by the Central Reserve Bank are designated as the unified currency. Implementation will begin in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui provinces, and the cities of Nanjing and Shanghai on June 8th. The specific measures are as follows: Banknotes issued by the Central Reserve Bank are the sole legal tender. All old currency must not be officially used without special permission. Old currency will be exchanged for Central Reserve Bank notes at a ratio of two to one, but public bonds of the same value may be substituted, or it may be deposited in banks as a deposit of the same amount. The old currency eligible for exchange is limited to banknotes issued by the Central Bank of China and the Bank of Communications, but banknotes bearing place names other than Shanghai and old subsidiary currency notes are not included in the exchange. Old subsidiary currency notes will temporarily be allowed to circulate at half the value of Central Reserve Bank subsidiary currency notes. A special account will be established to handle the redemption of principal and interest on public bonds issued in exchange for old currency, to facilitate prompt repayment. For legitimate purposes, loans may be obtained from the Central Reserve Bank using these bonds as collateral at face value. All debts and credits denominated or agreed upon in old currency units shall be converted to Central Reserve Bank note units at a ratio of two to one. Hereafter, contracts denominated in old currency units will be invalid. The transportation of old currency from outside the Peace Zone to within the Peace Zone will be strictly prohibited from now on."

Exchange Methods

According to a Tongmeng News Agency report, the official locations for exchanging Central Reserve Bank notes are: The Central Reserve Bank, the Central Reserve Bank offices soon to be established in Shanghai and Nanjing, Japanese banks, and specially designated exchange shops and money houses. The names will be announced separately. The methods for the above financial institutions to recover legal tender are as follows: Those wishing to exchange old currency for Central Reserve Bank notes up to 10,000 yuan may do so at the above banks, exchange shops, and money houses at a ratio of two to one. This period is limited to fourteen days, from June 8th to June 21st. These banks, exchange shops, and money houses must, during this period, transfer the old currency they receive to the Central Reserve Bank and obtain Central Reserve Bank notes at the official exchange rate. Those holding old currency worth more than 10,000 yuan should apply for exchange to the Central Reserve Bank and its designated banks (names to be announced separately) from June 8th to June 21st. The Central Reserve Bank and its designated banks will accept these at the official exchange rate of two to one, as Central Reserve Bank note cash deposits. The designated banks will then deliver the old currency received during the above period to the Central Reserve Bank as cash deposits. Chinese commercial banks, exchange shops, money houses, and trust companies must submit a report of their holdings of old currency as of June 7th to the Central Reserve Bank before June 10th. The old currency received by the Central Reserve Bank from these banks and firms will be converted to Central Reserve Bank notes at the official exchange rate of two to one, with half issued as public bonds for financial stability and the other half as cash deposits. The Central Reserve Bank may also convert a portion of the total amount of old currency submitted by certain financial institutions into current account deposits, paying annual interest of three percent, and may convert the current account deposits into cash deposits of the same amount within three months.

Zhou Fohai Speaks

Zhou Fohai made a statement yesterday, the main points of which are as follows: The issuance of public bonds for financial stability is limited to the silver and banking industry, amounting to half of the total, or one-half. These bonds can be used as cash payments at any time, without the risk of illiquidity. Deposits from ordinary industrial and commercial people, regardless of the amount, will not be accompanied by public bonds. Rumors circulating about restricting withdrawals are completely unfounded. However, amounts over 10,000 yuan will be treated as cash deposits, while amounts under 10,000 yuan will be treated as cash. Even amounts over 10,000 yuan can still be paid out at any time. There is no distinction between cash and current accounts from now on, regardless of the amount of old currency. New legal tender will be exchanged at a ratio of two to one. This will eliminate people's losses from discounting. All contracts for debts are to be paid with new legal tender at a ratio of two to one from June 1st. Any subsequent contracts made in old currency will be invalid. The reorganization of old currency will take effect on June 1st. The deadline for exchanging new legal tender is from June 8th to June 21st. Only old legal tender from the Central Bank, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications will be exchanged. Other miscellaneous notes will not be exchanged. There will be no extensions granted after the deadline.

### The Shanghai Municipal Council's New Organization for Solving All Problems (10): The Future of the People of Shanghai Will Be Decided in Their Palms

Direct Supply

In addition to retail sales through rice stores, the Rice and Food Office also directly supplies factories or companies employing more than thirty permanent Chinese staff. These organizations should apply to the office, providing details such as the number of employees. In most cases, a certificate from an accountant designated by the Shanghai Municipal Council is required to prove the accuracy of the numbers listed in the application. Only then can rice be allocated to the company in accordance with the bureau's fixed daily per capita requirement.

When all bureau rice leaves the warehouse, the purchaser receives a transport permit to move it from the warehouse to its destination. Upon completion of the transport, the permit should be returned to the Rice and Food Office immediately. Failure to return the permit within 24 hours of shipment will result in the forfeiture of the ten-yuan deposit paid per bag before the permit was issued. This is a necessary measure to prevent the misuse of permits.

Special Organizations

Public utility companies, charities, schools, and hospitals belong to the same category as the above-mentioned factories. They have been receiving supplies directly from the Rice and Food Office since the initial implementation of the rice allocation measures. In each case, the rice distribution must undergo strict verification to ensure that it is used to meet the stated needs. In addition to these organizations, about three or four hundred people pay and collect shipping orders at the office every day. "Distributing rice is certainly more troublesome when you have no inventory yourself and have to withdraw it from scattered warehouses within the settlement," said Mr. Liki. "Before December 8th, the Municipal Council only purchased rice from a very small number of vendors. But since the formal requisition began, the Municipal Council has actually transacted with several hundred. In other words, we have to clear and pay the accounts of hundreds of companies that had their rice stocks requisitioned."

Requisition Method

Before purchasing, the Rice and Food Office must first obtain the numbers and marks of the warehouse receipts for the rice stored in each warehouse. At the time of purchase, the rice of each owner is weighed and recorded separately by weighers. Payment is then made based on this weight.

"A large number of people were used for this requisition plan," said the rice control officer. "We not only have to check the quality and weight of the rice we receive, but also have to verify that the person applying for the return of the rice payment is indeed the owner of this stock."

For these reasons, more than one hundred staff members work hard every day from 9:00 AM to 6:00 or 7:00 PM.

In addition to rice, this office is also responsible for purchasing maize. With the exception of what is allocated to pastures, all maize purchased is ground and then distributed to the public through rice stores as a supplement to rice. The method of purchasing and distributing maize is exactly the same as for rice.

"Once things are organized," Mr. Liki finally said, "it becomes much easier, but the work the Municipal Council encountered here came suddenly. There was almost no time to prepare to start the machine. This is not just a matter of purchasing and selling—in general, it is a matter of controlling the distribution of rice. If it were just a matter of 'the more you sell, the better,' there would never have been a food problem, and the Municipal Council would not have had to set prices and manage distribution. Unfortunately, the reality is not so... This is life." (End) Yesterday's newspaper dispatch time was 6:15 PM.

### Financial Upheaval Looms: Tensions Run High on the Eve of a Major Transformation, Markets Experience Tumultuous Waves

Surviving the past week has been no easy feat. Reading the notices posted in front of the various banks last night reveals that the financial storm of the past two weeks has entered a period of overall resolution this week. What the future holds is difficult to predict. The important events in the market over the past week are reviewed and commented on below.

Currency Falls by Half, Prices Double

The Central Reserve Bank note was originally equal in value to the legal tender. Starting on March 23rd of this year, it increased in value to 77% of legal tender: that is, 100 yuan of legal tender equaled 77 yuan of Central Reserve Bank notes. This rate remained unchanged until May 20th. In the week that followed, it depreciated daily: it depreciated to 74 yuan on the 20th, 71 yuan on the 21st, 66 yuan on the 22nd, and 60 yuan on the 23rd. Although the 24th was a Sunday and there was no market, it was announced in advance in the newspapers that it would depreciate to 53 yuan on the 25th (i.e., last Monday). It then depreciated to 50 yuan on the 26th. Since then, the depreciation has stopped.

At the initial announcement of 77%, there was talk in the market of 66%. People still regarded it as a rumor, but prices had already taken this as a target for increases, and even exceeded it. If we compare the three periods before and after the 77% discount and after the 50% discount, we can see that the currency depreciation was not as fast as the rise in prices, and the rise in foreign currency was no weaker.

Capital Outflow, Current Accounts Become Loose

The listing stopped at 50%, and the relevant authorities issued a statement, and the market gradually stabilized. Unexpectedly, rumors suddenly arose, culminating in a withdrawal rush for one and a half days over the weekend. Fortunately, the city's silver and banking industry has long been weathered and remained calm in the face of danger. In particular, the joint reserve system was flexible and coped effectively, preventing a major disaster. This is very gratifying.

When people talk about speculation, they often point to hot money as the culprit. This time, however, hot money flowed into the market in large quantities due to withdrawals, and speculative prices actually fell sharply. This is noteworthy. Is it because there are few new transactions and a large amount of credit has been released? How else could this be achieved? Why were there so many transactions in the past? And what is the reason for the release of credit today? This is an interesting question.

More than a month ago, current accounts were at a premium to cash, but now they have changed to a discount. How quickly they turn against each other! On Monday, when the currency price plummeted, the current account discount soared to as much as 16 yuan per hundred. The higher the current account discount, the greater the upward pressure on prices, because the speculative market leads prices, and the speculative market uses current accounts as its unit of calculation. The silver and banking authorities are now taking steps to eliminate the discount, which is indeed a matter of urgency. However, the elimination plan is limited to the clearing of the difference in exchanges between silver and banking counterparts, so ordinary billholders can only discount on the open market, and therefore cannot avoid the discount. However, the elimination of the difference between counterparts has had a powerful impact on the entire current account discount market. In addition, a large amount of cash has flowed into the market due to withdrawals, which will have a more active effect. This is why the current account discount fell back over the weekend.

### Stock Prices Soar, Bond Market Sees Three Rises and Three Pauses

First, regarding securities: the face value of Chinese stocks is in legal tender, but the assets follow prices. When the currency denomination changes, the assets do not change, so the price is firm. When the currency denomination does not change, the asset evaluation rises in inverse proportion to the currency depreciation, so the price is also high. The initial rise of the week was enormous, and then those that had not risen rose, and those that had risen too much contracted. This was an adjustment of people's minds, so the overall trend of the week was indeed firm, but the fluctuations were very violent. New medicine stocks and underwear stocks both rose and fell, such as Wu Zhou, which fluctuated by 50 yuan. Other industrial stocks were flat and then bullish, while financial stocks did not move. Only the Bank of China and China United Trust had a 10% gain. Foreign stocks rose at the beginning of the week and then fell sharply, with drastic changes, each fluctuating by 10%. But regardless of Chinese stocks or foreign stocks, they were outstanding compared to the previous week. Chinese stocks reached unprecedented highs during the week, and foreign stocks also largely broke the records of the same period last year.

The bond market has been turbulent, with intense competition. On Monday, all bonds rose by more than four yuan, eventually reaching the daily limit. This swept away the sluggishness of January and February. On Tuesday, B, C, D, and E continued to rise, reaching the daily limit for the second time. A also rose by 3.3 yuan. With these two days of sharp rises, the return wind after Wednesday was expected. On that day, all bonds fell by more than three yuan, with only D falling by 1.5 yuan. The fall did not stop on Thursday, and A even fell by another four yuan before reaching the daily limit. However, many parties took advantage of the low prices to buy, so the fall had weakened by Friday, and on Saturday, A and B saw the daily limit again. A week of three rises and three pauses can be called a spectacle.

### Gold Prices Rise Higher and Higher, Foreign Currencies Turn Purple

The idea of metallic currency is still alive, so if the currency price falls, the gold price will inevitably soar, and there are also activities to escape capital. However, on Monday, the gold price saw an unprecedented high of 40,000 yuan, which was too much. The depreciation was then stopped at 50%, so bullish traders took profits and the momentum subsided slightly. However, the market price for the whole week still hovered around 35,000 yuan, which is more than 10,000 yuan higher than before the currency turmoil.

Foreign currencies (British pounds) rose rapidly along with the gold price. At the weekend, the US dollar and British pound reached as high as 800 yuan, which is even more astonishing. Military scrip once soared to 14 yuan, which, after deducting the current account discount, also reached more than 12 yuan. The military scrip is linked to the Central Reserve Bank note. With 100 yuan of Central Reserve Bank notes equal to 18 yuan of military scrip, and 1 yuan of legal tender equal to 1 yuan of Central Reserve Bank notes, the strength of the rise can be seen.

Folklore

### The Fire of the Caucasus

— Jian Nong

The majestic Caucasus Mountains, stretching 1,200 kilometers from the northwest to the southeast, their name means "Light." How did they get this name? Common geography books explain that, besides the main peak Mount Elbrus, there are nine peaks above the snow line, all covered in perpetual snow and shimmering glaciers, hence they are called the "Mountains of Light." However, people forget that the Caucasus region, especially the Apsheron Peninsula where Baku is located, is one of the world's leading oil field centers: the name "Mountains of Light" actually comes from here. Please let me explain further.

According to historical records, the small village of Surakhani, not far north of Baku—now a concentration of oil wells—was already famous as the location of the "Eternal Fire" in 600 BC. This "Eternal Fire" burned fiercely to a height of tens or hundreds of feet and could burn for hundreds of years without being extinguished. The ancients were baffled by this "fire that could burn without consuming fuel," and many Zoroastrian fire worshippers traveled thousands of miles to the "Eternal Fire" to prostrate themselves and show their devotion. Can you say that the name "Mountains of Light" has nothing to do with the "Eternal Fire"?

The great French geographer Élisée Reclus, in his monumental work "Universal Geography" published in 1881, also described the Apsheron Peninsula as follows: "In several places on the peninsula, one only needs to dig in the topsoil to release flammable gas. A spark can ignite a great fire, which continues to burn until a strong gale or a downpour extinguishes it. Sometimes the flames arise spontaneously; on stormy nights, one sees tongues of fire scattering their flickering phosphorescence across the hillsides near and far..." Can you say that the name "Mountains of Light" has nothing to do with these flames?

Furthermore, according to Greek mythology, Prometheus, the great god who stole fire from the heavens to bestow it upon humanity, was envied by Zeus, the lord of the universe, and was chained to the Caucasus Mountains, enduring the hardship of having his liver devoured by an eagle every day. Perhaps this is also because the Greeks saw the flickering lights on the Caucasus Mountains and created this story? Believing that the flames flickering on the hillsides were the embodiment of Prometheus?

Regardless, it can be asserted that the relationship between the name "Mountains of Light" and snow-covered glaciers is very tenuous. But oh, the location of this "Eternal Fire"! Will you withstand the coming storm?

### Thunder

— Lei Kaiqian

When summer arrives, the first thing that comes to my mind is the thunder of summer evenings.

The hotter and more stifling the weather, the easier it is to miss the sound of thunder. Because once the thunder rolls, the oppressive air can be scattered by a downpour.

You say that during thunderstorms, unfortunate things inevitably happen, so you often feel a sense of fear towards the loud thunder. But I disagree, because I think that sacrificing oneself in a thunderstorm is much more refreshing than slowly suffocating on a hot, airless summer night. Moreover, being struck by lightning is, after all, a minority of the minority.

I have always loved thunder, especially the first clap of thunder on a hot, stifling summer evening.

Whenever the summer evenings are sweltering and the air is oppressively stifling, I often pant with unbearable breath, open all the windows, raise my head, and cock my ear, hoping to hear a clear clap of thunder.

This thunder should be the most beautiful music in the world. It not only makes people feel relaxed and happy, but also, I think, it must be able to stretch my long-suppressed lungs and then irrigate me with fresh air.

The footsteps of the seasons have once again stepped into the stage of summer; that stifling air, that unbearable night! I long for a clap of thunder to suddenly sound from the horizon and then resonate across our land.

Invention

### Indoor Sunlight Lamp

— Shen Xiong

The importance of sunlight to human health is well known, so enlightened people have advocated sunbathing. However, due to customs and other reasons, this movement has not been very developed. Now scientists have invented a sunlight lamp suitable for home use, so you can enjoy sunbathing without leaving your home. This device can be used with ordinary screw-type sockets, and the artificial sunlight it emits contains ultraviolet light and heat rays. According to the designers, indoor sunlight lamps do not harm the eyes, so there is no need to wear sunglasses. Ordinary electricity at 110 to 125 volts is sufficient for use. The power consumption is about 275 watts.

### Sharing a Boat in Storms

— He Jiazhi

(5) Retaliation

Guoqi laughed at what Weicheng said, "My thoughts and your thoughts are different. I like to advance rapidly, and you like to advance slowly. That's it. When will you come to Shanghai? When you come to Shanghai, bring your aunt's consent. Probably, once you get your aunt's consent, we brothers and sisters will also get our father's consent. Let's not talk about it today. What's your uncle's name?" Guoqi asked Weicheng's uncle's name, claiming it was a new topic, no longer discussing the marriage issue. Weicheng told him and returned to his bed, and they each lay down. After about ten minutes, Weicheng heard that Guoqi was not yet asleep and laughed, "Guoqi, are you still not asleep? You never have trouble sleeping away from home. Even that day in the storm, you fell asleep for a while on the boat." Guoqi said, "Tonight, I don't know why. I should be tired." Weicheng raised his face on the pillow and looked at the half-lit lamp, saying, "I'll teach you a method. You just need to silently recite one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, to one hundred, two hundred, three hundred, and you will naturally fall asleep." Guoqi chuckled and laughed, "Then why don't you try this method on yourself?" Weicheng also laughed, "I know you are good at blaming others but bad at blaming yourself. You have planned everything perfectly for me and Guofang; do you also want me to plan for you?" Guoqi said, "What are you saying? I'm not the kind of person you're talking about, who wants to enjoy rights after fulfilling obligations. Whenever I can't fall asleep at night, I think of my family and my country. Family and national affairs can only help people feel sad and cannot excite them." Weicheng sat up from the quilt and said, "Family, how is your family? You have a stepmother, what's wrong, do you have some unspeakable secrets?" Guoqi stretched out his hands and waved them at Weicheng. He only told Weicheng the four words "Don't talk, don't talk."
