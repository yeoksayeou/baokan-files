### Madagascar Commander Drafting Protocol; British Forces Occupy Diego Suarez; Fighting Still Occurring on the Orangéa Peninsula

London, July 7th, Reuters - Prime Minister Churchill stated in the House of Commons today that, following the surrender of French forces at Diego Suarez, commanders on Madagascar are currently drafting a protocol. The British fleet is expected to enter Diego Suarez harbor at 3:30 PM today (British time). During the initial attack on a French position, the British were repelled, suffering over a thousand casualties. However, British commander Major General Sturges launched another attack last night and captured the position. The Prime Minister also stated that, as previously announced, the British landings have been completed. By Tuesday evening, contact had been made with French forces in and around Diego Suarez harbor and before Cape d'Anosy and the Orangéa Peninsula. At dawn yesterday, the initial British attack on Cape d'Anosy was repelled, with over a thousand casualties. However, Major General Sturges, commanding the British forces on the island, launched another attack at night and finally captured the cape. French naval and land commanders have surrendered, and the city of Diego Suarez has also been occupied. This morning, British forces attacked the artillery batteries at the entrance to the harbor of Orangéa, and these batteries have now also surrendered. A surrender protocol is currently being drafted by both commanders.

Berlin, July 7th, Reuters - The German news agency reported from Vichy that wireless communication between Vichy and Madagascar has been cut off since this morning (Thursday). According to reports from the island's capital, French forces have withdrawn south from Diego Suarez to new positions.

London, July 7th, Reuters - It was reported from London this afternoon that British forces in Madagascar have occupied the French naval base of Diego Suarez, and organized resistance in the north of the island has ceased. Earlier this morning, the British announced that British forces had captured Anosy, a key city in the Diego Suarez harbor area, last night. British casualties were light. The terms of surrender for Diego Suarez are currently being drafted. British forces landed at two locations: one at Courrier Bay and the other a few miles south of Ambararata. The former force attacked Diego Suarez, while the latter advanced on the city of Anosy and was halted one or two miles south of the city last night. Organized resistance may still exist on the Orangéa Peninsula (to the right of the harbor, east of Anosy). British forces were unable to bring heavy equipment ashore during the landings and were unable to transport a large number of non-metallic element troops onto the island, so close air support is crucial.

Vichy, July 7th, Havas - It has just been learned that the government appointed General Gillot to be the commander-in-chief of the naval, land, and air forces of Madagascar on the 4th of this month. General Gillot was born in Paris in 1884, graduated from the École Centrale des Arts et Manufactures, and has served in French West Africa and Annam. He has also served as a professor of geography at the artillery school. In July 1938, he served in the General Staff as Inspector of Artillery. He was promoted to Major General in 1939 for his war exploits. In the Dunkirk campaign of the previous year, he was commended for his skillful command. In November 1940, he was appointed commander of the French East African garrison. He was promoted to Lieutenant General in November 1941.

London, July 7th, Reuters - There are no confirmed follow-up reports from Madagascar. The besieged French forces in Diego Suarez are resisting, but the extent of their resistance is unclear. The garrison numbers approximately 5,500, of whom 1,500 are white. There are also some white police and naval personnel. The British have suffered some casualties. The weather in the war zone is extremely hot. Reports from Vichy that British forces are using paratroopers have not been confirmed.

London, July 6th, Havas - The Admiralty has just issued a communiqué stating, "After our forces landed along the northern coast of Madagascar, French forces are resisting fiercely, preventing our advance. Our losses are heavier than yesterday, but we are continuing to advance under the cover of naval and air forces."

### Dakar Port Will Also Become Focus of Attention

Washington, July 7th, Havas - The San Francisco Chronicle published an editorial today advocating the occupation of other French territories and entrusting them to the Allied powers to be held in trust for the French government. These include Dakar in French West Africa and the islands of Martinique in the West Indies. The Portuguese Azores and Cape Verde, and the Spanish Canary Islands, also hold important strategic positions.

Geneva, July 6th, Havas - International observers here have recently commented that the British landings in Madagascar inevitably raise doubts as to whether this is the prelude to a large-scale invasion of the French colonial empire. The United States, in its note to the French government yesterday, stated that the landings on the island were solely for strategic reasons. If the French resisted, it would be tantamount to declaring war on Britain and the United States, in which case the United States might apply the same pretext to other French territories. It is imperative to closely monitor the developing situation.

Vichy, July 6th, Havas - According to news received here at midnight, the course of the fighting on Madagascar is as follows: On the morning of the 5th of this month, Rear Admiral Syfret, commander of the British fleet, sailed into the Diego Suarez naval harbor and delivered an ultimatum to the local French commander, demanding unconditional surrender within seven hours. At the same time, British naval and air forces began attacking the harbor. The French rejected the so-called ultimatum immediately. Minutes later, the British air force intensified its attacks, targeting the airfield and the French navy in Diego Suarez harbor. Two French warships were reportedly sunk. Simultaneously, British light mechanized units landed in Courrier Bay (15 miles southeast of Diego Suarez naval harbor) and paratroopers landed south of the harbor. Although the British forces were numerous, the local garrison resisted bravely. Fierce fighting continued throughout the night, and as of noon on the 6th, the battle was still in progress. Three British aircraft were shot down, several motorcycles were destroyed, and several British soldiers, including four officers, were captured. The enemy's offensive has now been halted. From the night of the 5th to the morning of the 6th, both sides were still engaged in fierce fighting on the outer defensive lines of Diego Suarez harbor. Later, the French warship "D'Entrecasteaux" landed troops and launched a counterattack, recovering several positions and greatly boosting morale. According to the latest news, the fierce fighting is still in progress, demonstrating that the French naval, land, and air forces are fulfilling their duty and upholding their traditional honor.

Vichy, July 6th, Havas - According to the latest news received here at midnight from Madagascar, it has been learned that French resistance is growing stronger. The British are using air support and concentrating their attacks on Diego Suarez harbor. Seven British aircraft were shot down today, indicating that Britain has sent a large force to the island.

Vichy, July 6th, Havas - According to the latest report sent by Governor General Annet of Madagascar, approximately twelve or thirteen British warships are concentrated near Courrier Bay and Diego Suarez harbor. At dawn today, British warships resumed shelling the naval base. French forces are currently resisting with all their might. The French air force is also actively participating in the war. However, the overall situation must be considered extremely critical.

### US Protests to France Being Studied; Transportation Bureau Orders Closure of French Submarine Telegraph Company

Washington, July 6th, Havas - Secretary of State Hull told reporters, "Our information regarding the situation in Madagascar is incomplete. It is too early to comment rashly. It is also unclear whether French resistance is growing stronger. Therefore, it is difficult to determine whether France has adopted a hostile attitude towards the United States. Mr. Tuck, the US Chargé d'Affaires in France, has forwarded the French note to the State Department, and we are currently studying it. It is too early to say whether a response is necessary."

Washington, July 6th, Havas - The Defense Transportation Bureau has ordered the French Submarine Telegraph Company to close immediately.

### French Cabinet Holds Meeting; Laval Reports on Political Events; Sends Telegram of Condolences to the Soldiers and Civilians of Madagascar

Vichy, July 6th, Havas - The cabinet held a state council meeting today, presided over by Marshal Pétain. First, Prime Minister Laval reported on recent political events and detailed the current situation in Madagascar based on the latest news. Then, Naval Minister Admiral Auphan and Colonial Minister Pléven spoke successively, explaining that the garrison on the island was resisting the invasion heroically, regardless of heavy losses. Finally, it was decided in the name of the State Council to send telegram of condolences to the authorities and all soldiers and civilians of Madagascar.

Vichy, July 6th, Havas - Colonial Minister Pléven sent a telegram to Governor General Annet of Madagascar today, stating, "Our country is currently suffering a shameful invasion in the Diego Suarez area, but the resolute resistance of the garrison has moved France and the entire colonial empire and is regarded as the highest honor. The garrison of our colony can be proud of its brave actions this time. Please convey the regards of the Marshal and the people of the whole country to all the officers and soldiers. The whole country mourns the martyrs. In short, we have complete confidence in your patriotic loyalty and ability to defend the colony in difficult times."

Lyon, July 6th, Havas - The Times reported, "The French people are extremely indignant after hearing about the events in Madagascar and their development. The last paragraph of the American note stated, 'If the French government allows acts of war against Britain and the United States to occur, the US government will consider this an act of war against the Allied powers.' This statement is of great significance and cannot be ignored. Therefore, Prime Minister Laval immediately replied that 'The arguments used by the United States to prevent France from defending its territory are unacceptable to France.' This response was moderate and courteous in its wording, but its attitude was very firm. France has explained its position to the United States. As Prime Minister Laval said, France does not wish to initiate the final stage of relations between the United States and France.' The future developments are readily apparent, whatever they may be."

### Newspaper Commentary

Tokyo, July 7th, Domei News Agency - In addition to reporting the news of the British surprise attack on French Madagascar in detail on the front page, local newspapers have also provided commentary. The content unanimously condemned this act of piracy by Britain and expressed deep resentment and hatred for the United States' support for the British attack on the island. An editorial in the Asahi Shimbun discussed the issue of French colonies and concluded by stating that the continuation of French-American relations is as hopeless as searching for fish in a tree. Therefore, if France wishes to preserve its territory, it must actively resist. An editorial in the Tokyo Nichi-Nichi Shimbun stated that before Laval returned to Vichy, Britain and the United States had been putting pressure on the French government. When Laval became Prime Minister, British and American pressure and propaganda intensified in the hope of preventing German-French rapprochement. Britain and the United States occupied this undefended Madagascar in order to alleviate domestic criticism of their defeats and also to defend a key point in the Indian Ocean, hoping to use it as a link between Britain and the United States and India, West Asia, and Australia. However, with the Japanese army's suppression of the Indian Ocean and the fervent anti-British sentiment in India, the British and American plans will become a dream. An editorial in the Hochi Shimbun stated that the British government chose this easiest operation to carry out, the occupation of Madagascar, in response to calls from British public opinion to form a first line of defense in Europe. Such an invasion of France will be difficult to escape criticism from world public opinion. An editorial in the Yomiuri Shimbun stated that there is no doubt that this military action by the British has the support of US strategy. However, this will inevitably lead to the strengthening of the German-French agreement. Therefore, if the Vichy government mobilizes its powerful navy and acts in concert with the Axis powers, the position of the Axis powers in Africa and the Mediterranean will be strengthened as a result of the Madagascar war.

Branches that have been approved for establishment before the promulgation of these regulations shall be exempt from the restrictions of the preceding paragraph, but shall submit the proposed amount of operating funds for each branch to the Ministry of Finance for record. Article 3: If, after investigation by the Ministry of Finance, it is deemed unnecessary to establish a branch in the place where a commercial bank applies to establish a branch due to the industrial and commercial and general economic and financial conditions, establishment will not be permitted. Article 4: Commercial banks applying to establish branches must submit the following documents: 1. Business plan (including the proposed name, address, name and resume of the person in charge, the amount of operating funds to be allocated, and the business promotion plan). 2.

### Madagascar (1)

After the French island of Madagascar was landed on by British troops, it has attracted worldwide attention. However, this island is located in the southeast of Africa, and the world has not paid much attention to it. According to the French book "Madegascar Ovation Francaise," a detailed discussion is made about this. The author is Marins-Ary Feblond, a well-known expert on the island of Madagascar. His descriptions are extremely accurate. Now, Mr. Nanshan has been invited to translate and publish the excerpt. It might be what readers eagerly want to see! - Editor

Madagascar was occupied by the British military yesterday. This news immediately became the focus of attention for people all over the world. Madagascar is not only the most important territory of the French colonies, but also because of its geographical location. It is the hub of shipping routes between Europe and Asia, and a key point in the western Indian Ocean. Therefore, in the current war, it has long become a target of competition between the Allied forces and the Axis powers. However, after France was defeated, it declared neutrality, and the British action was delayed until today. At present, the war is in progress. The Madagascar government has been ordered by Vichy to resist to the death. However, considering the weakness of the local garrison and the vastness of the coastline, it is doubtful whether the island can sustain resistance for a long time.

Madagascar is the third largest island in the world. Although it is only 240 miles away from the southeast coast of Africa, it has been isolated from the mainland for hundreds of years and has become an isolated unit. This island is rich in minerals, so even the rich places like Australia or New Guinea pale in comparison. Regarding Madagascar, many magical legends have been left behind. At least in the eyes of ordinary people, this is an extremely strange place. This is the origin of lemurs. Persians and Arabs call it Sarrandil. In the eyes of the Moors, it is also a Moon Island. Speaking of its area, it has a total of 228,000 square miles, which is larger than the total area of several European countries. From a geological point of view, it is very similar to Australia, and its distribution of flora and fauna is almost the same as Australia. It is very accurate for the French to call it French Australia.

Madagascar is a magical island. Even today in Paris, people still mention it with a sense of mystery, as if telling a story. Indeed, the people, customs, and even the slightly stiff language and the charm of the native women are all stained with a layer of dazzling color. It has a simple beauty and rare scenery. A traveler from afar will feel confused by the dreamlike scenery.

We may compare it to Australia, but we must not think that it is as desolate as the interior of the Australian continent. In terms of geographical structure, everything is evenly distributed, and there are no obvious imbalances. The mountains spread from the center to all sides, forming many plateaus and basins, with a mild climate. Rivers meander down the valleys, forming many alluvial areas, which serve as the cultural gathering areas on the island. In the interior, many lakes are dotted like constellations, and the beautiful ripples sparkle in the sunlight. This is the nest of those unknown and strange island species. Many beautiful legends have been left behind, reflecting the ancient and past sentiments.

The geological structure of the eastern and central two-thirds of the ground is dominated by huge granite rocks, which are carved into countless parallel lines due to the continuous and intense lateral pressure. The situation in the west is the opposite, with alluvial layers. This area is rich in calcium and red sandstone, so the surface is blocky. This unique geological structure affects the plants, which are all novel species. As for the animals, there are many species, with sixty-six kinds of mammals (New Guinea only has two). This special animal species has attracted the keen attention of many biologists. Years of exploration and research have yielded extremely valuable harvests, adding a different color to the academic world.

When we step into the interior from the Indian Ocean coast, in Tananarive, we can discover many different things on the journey. They flash before our eyes like moving film, but everything is coordinated in a very harmonious way. On the coast, the dense tropical coconut groves are blown by the monsoon, creating a very vivid picture. There are also countless amphibious animals lurking in the thorny and low jungles, and the ochre-colored mountain light and the verdant leaves are interwoven into extremely beautiful patterns. But as soon as we step into the Grande Sylve, another scene comes into view. Here are steep cliffs and rushing waterfalls. The central plateau is covered with lush moss and other lower plants. We seem to have returned to the ancient primitive times.

Many people talk about Madagascar, only paying attention to its economic value. Naturally, this is a practical point of view. Madagascar is an island mainly based on agriculture and animal husbandry. Every year, there are large yields of rice, beans, and sugarcane. In addition, it has abundant mineral resources, producing gold, silver, copper, iron, lead, zinc, etc. But if we ignore its racial characteristics, we will make a serious mistake. The achievements of Madagascar today are closely linked to its superior race. Their general characteristics are lively and delicate, more emotional, slightly neurotic, but hardworking and know how to progress. These qualities are not difficult to find in a native Kosmos person.

The La Region Regnante and the central plateau are inhabited by the Hovas, who have Malay blood and semi-yellow skin. They have exceptional intelligence and are a very ambitious nation. They have established kingdoms in the past, with a perfect organization. There are also the Betsiles, a gentle people with a pastoral atmosphere, like the Koreans of the East. The masters of the near eastern mountains are the poetic and imaginative Tanales, who mostly travel in the mountain areas. On the eastern coast live the Betsimisares, who are obedient, happy, and peace-loving, mostly engaged in fishing and hunting. Further south are the Antemours and Antaifaches. Because of their special characteristics of diligence and perseverance, the French call them the Auvergnants of Madagascar. (The Auvergnants of mainland France are known for their diligence and thrift.) At the southernmost tip are the Bores Antanouches, Antandro.vs., and Mahafales tribes, who often gather in teams to do arduous work and are skilled sailors. At the northernmost tip are the Tsimiheles and Antankares. In the vast western region is the world of the Baobabs, where a group of nomadic Sakalaves people often pass through, like the Gypsy people with artistic talents, galloping on the desolate grasslands as adults.

From this, it is not difficult for us to know that this is an island full of racial complexity, but because of their lazy nature, everything depends on fate, so they can still get along well. They are still left in the tribal semi-civilized era. Most people's minds are relatively simple. Their main food is rice and meat. Their main trade is selling furs, livestock, and gold.

We have briefly talked about its geography and the distribution of its races. We might as well talk about the history of the French occupation of the island. This should be quite helpful for someone who wants to understand its social situation in the past 100 years. As early as the 17th century, France had the idea of trading with this large island. At that time, the island had already been preempted by the Portuguese. Regarding the history of the Portuguese rule of this island, there was a very long period of time. Their colonial policy was cruel and high-pressure, so many islanders unfortunately died. Indeed, the social situation at that time was extremely chaotic, lacking a systematic organization, and no different from pirates looting. Even today, when people talk about the terror and darkness of that time, they cannot help but change their faces at the mention of it.

### After Four Months of Hard Resistance, Corregidor Island Falls: Japanese Troops Successfully Land, Fighting Ceases; Washington Announces American Forces Surrendered

Tokyo, 7th (Domei) - The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 5:40 PM today that after the Japanese Army and Navy troops launched a landing operation on Corregidor Island at the mouth of Manila Bay at 11:15 PM on the 5th of this month, they completely occupied it at 8:00 AM this morning, and the nearby islands have also been captured.

Tokyo, 7th (Domei) - Thirty-two hours after the Japanese troops landed on Corregidor Island under intense fire in the dark night, namely at 8:00 AM today, they completely occupied this fortress that had been besieged for four months. According to reports from the Philippine battlefield, the Japanese troops began crossing the narrow strait between Corregidor and the mainland at 10:30 PM on May 5th, attacking the besieged American troops under General Wainwright with all their strength. At 11:00 PM, the first batch of Japanese troops began landing in three routes. The second and third batches of Japanese troops landed successively on Wednesday morning. They passed through wire obstacles and fortresses, broke into the enemy's陣, engaged in bayonet-to-bayonet fighting, destroyed the enemy's resistance along the coast, and entered the inland of the island. The newly arrived Japanese troops sent from the mainland also landed to assist in the battle. The Japanese troops and the American and Philippine troops fought fiercely all day on Wednesday. Japanese bombers carried out fierce bombings to facilitate the Japanese troops' advance. On Wednesday morning, the enemy's artillery positions on Caballo Island southwest of Corregidor Island were also bombed by Japanese aircraft. During the fierce fighting on that day, the Japanese troops occupied the Corregidor Island airfield and Mount Malinta in the central part of the island, which is 150 meters high. At 5:00 PM today, the Philippine Japanese Army Headquarters announced that the Japanese troops had captured the enemy陣 at the mouth of Manila Bay this morning, and the battle for this fortress ended.

Lisbon, 6th (Domei) - According to a Washington dispatch, the U.S. Department of the Army announced today that it had received a report from Corregidor Island stating that the American troops had been besieged for four months and were unable to hold out. The fighting had ceased, and the terms of surrender for the island and nearby islands were being discussed. According to the American radio broadcast, approximately 7,000 American and Philippine troops on the island had surrendered. According to the British radio broadcast, the American commander, General Wainwright, personally negotiated the terms of surrender with the Japanese generals.

Buenos Aires, 6th (Domei) - According to the U.S. Navy Department, it received the last report from Corregidor Island Naval Commander Lieutenant Commander Hofer, stating that five auxiliary ships had been sunk, including the minesweeper USS Tanager and the gunboat USS Luzon (450 tons), which were sunk by Japanese artillery shells from the Bataan Peninsula. The minesweeper USS Pigeon was sunk by bombers. The gunboat USS Luzon (560 tons) and the minesweeper USS Quail were severely damaged by artillery shells and were subsequently scuttled by the American troops themselves. At the time of the fall of Corregidor Island, there were 175 naval officers, 2,100 sailors, 70 Marine Corps officers, and 1,500 soldiers, all of whom have been captured.

The U.S. Capital Announces the Circumstances of the Fall

Washington, 7th (Reuters) - Washington announced yesterday that after the Japanese troops successfully landed on the northern beach of Corregidor Island on flat-bottomed boats on Tuesday night, General Wainwright, the commander of the American forces in the Philippines, ordered the Corregidor fortress and other artillery nests in Manila Bay defended by the American forces to surrender. Fort Mills, Fort Drum, and Fort Hughes were all among those surrendering. During the fighting in the past few days, three American minesweepers and two gunboats were sunk in Corregidor. It is generally estimated that there were approximately 7,000 men and women on the fortified islands at the time of the surrender of Corregidor, but the number of casualties under the artillery shells and bombs is currently unknown. When the Bataan Peninsula was abandoned on April 9th, approximately 3,500 American Marines and sailors retreated to Corregidor Island. A U.S. Department of the Army press release announced the fall of Corregidor, stating, "We have now received news from Corregidor reporting that our troops' resistance has been broken, the fighting has ceased, and the terms of surrender for the artillery fortresses on the islands in Manila Bay are being drafted." Washington officials did not indicate when the fighting ended. The Allied Command in Australia issued a press release last night stating that Wainwright "has ordered Corregidor and other fortified islands in Manila Harbor to surrender." According to a U.S. Army spokesman, there were over 3,000 American troops stationed in Bataan before the Japanese troops began their southern attack on the Bataan Peninsula, and the number later increased. After the fall of the Bataan Peninsula, a large number of American troops were transferred to Corregidor, but it is not known how many American troops were still stationed there at the time of the surrender. The surrender of Corregidor and other islands was announced three hours after the announcement that the Japanese troops had launched a landing attack on the northern shore of the island, but the terms of surrender were not mentioned. The defenders of Corregidor consisted of approximately 175 naval officers, 2,100 sailors, and 70 Marine Corps officers and 1,500 soldiers.

The authorities of the Axis powers have received notification from Norway that all ships that voluntarily accept this request will still be owned by Norwegian shipowners, and their captains and the goods they carry will not be considered war spoils. The German government also guarantees the safety of the Norwegian ship crews and will treat them as friends.

### The German Side Maintains a Bandage of Silence on Future Offensives; Britain and the Soviet Union Have Different Strategic Views, and Adjustment Work Has Not Yet Been Completed

Berlin, 7th (Haitong) - The military maintains absolute silence on the future spring offensive of the German army. There is no clue as to the timing and location of future battles. The recent activities of the German army in the east have divided several small islands into the German battlefront as "stepping stones" for future operations. This is a cautious and planned preparation by the German army. The Berlin military claims that the predetermined battle line for the German spring offensive has already been decided. The recent reports from the Soviet side that the Soviet army has launched a large-scale offensive in the central part of the eastern front are close to exaggeration and are inconsistent with the facts. The German side believes that the exaggeration of the Soviet Union is intended to deceive foreign countries, but in the actual situation, the Soviet army has no ability to engage in large-scale operations.

Berlin, 7th (Haitong) - The German Air Force is using asymmetrical aircraft in the eastern front, and the results are very good. Previous aircraft either had the engine placed inside the aircraft or symmetrically placed on both wings, while this new aircraft has the engine placed on the left wing and the pilot's seat on the right wing. It has high speed, agile movement, rapid ascent, and is equipped with new weapons. The name is BV-141, and it was designed by Dr. Vogt, the chief engineer of the BV Aircraft Factory.

London, 6th (Havas) - The "Daily Worker" recently carried a report stating that "Britain and the Soviet Union clearly have major differences in their views on the war situation. This is certainly not because the British view is wrong, but Britain must try its best to adjust the actions of the two countries so that the actions of the Allied countries are completely consistent. Our ideal is to make every soldier and every firearm available where they can be useful to meet the strategic needs jointly formulated by the Allied countries. On this matter, we have not yet completed this adjustment work. The government should understand that the people of the whole country are encouraged by the spirit of offense and want to turn defense into offense. However, we should also understand that only the government can weigh the situation and determine whether our country's strength can attack. According to recent news, our country's weapons production has not yet reached its peak."

The German Chief of State's Headquarters, 7th (Haitong) - This afternoon's German war report stated that most of the Eastern European front was quiet. There was only localized warfare on the northern route, and the enemy suffered considerable losses. The German troops who have recently launched an offensive, the 5th Infantry Division of Odenburg and the 6th Silesian Division, have achieved the best results. Our army has repeatedly attacked in Lapland and Murmansk.

### The Trade and Currency of India (Part Two)

The people of India have always placed great importance on savings, and they enjoy using precious metals as adornments. In ancient times, there was a lack of efficient methods for using currency, so large quantities of gold and silver flowed into India from Western countries. When the East India Company was established in India in the 17th century, the main currency in circulation was silver coins, but gold coins were also minted. As early as 1600, the British minted a type of currency that circulated in India, with a design very similar to the Spanish silver dollar. In 1667, the British began to mint rupees, but before 1758, the circulation of these rupees was not very widespread. Before the 19th century, there had been no attempts to unify the currency system within British India. In 1806, the British authorities considered the currency issue in India and decided to make the silver rupee the main currency of India, while the gold rupee could also circulate at the same time. Until 1835, a unified silver monometallic standard was adopted throughout British India. Subsequently, there were several attempts to switch to gold coins, but they were unsuccessful. Before the end of the 19th century, the currency situation in India was quite unstable. The main reasons for this were: 1) the fall in silver prices; and 2) the Indian government had to pay huge sums of money to the British government. As a result of the fall in silver prices, the ratio of the rupee's value to British currency gradually decreased. In 1873, it fell from two shillings to one shilling and ten and thirty-five hundredths of a penny. In 1876, it fell to one shilling and nine and one-quarter of a penny. In 1892, it fell to one shilling and two and ninety-eighty-five thousandths of a penny. In 1894, it fell even further to one shilling and one-half of a penny. The impact of this change was to encourage exports and reduce imports in Indian trade. Merchants could buy goods in the Indian market and transport them to the UK, obtaining more rupees for each pound than before, and buying more Indian goods to transport to the UK.

However, on the other hand, British manufacturers who shipped goods to India still received rupees in exchange, which greatly reduced their profits. The result of India's trade surplus with the UK was a large influx of silver into India, which in turn caused prices in India to rise. At the same time, the Indian government received revenue in rupees, but payments to the UK for remittances, interest, purchases, etc., had to be calculated at gold prices, resulting in very heavy losses. To save the financial crisis, the only way out was to switch to the gold standard. After several twists and turns, India finally implemented the gold standard in 1899. The British gold sovereign and half-sovereign, as well as the rupee, became legal tender in India. To maintain the stability of the silver coin's value and to ensure that it could be exchanged for gold sovereigns if necessary, the government established a gold standard reserve. After 1893, the minting of rupees almost ceased. Therefore, in 1900, it was discovered that the amount of currency was insufficient to meet the needs of circulation. The government then purchased silver to engage in minting to meet the demand. In 1906, a bronze coin was used to replace copper, and fractional coins worth one anna were minted to facilitate circulation.

During the era of the East India Company, banking operations were not yet standardized. Most of the lending at high interest rates was done by retired company officials to their own organized "agencies." In 1828 and 1834, due to the failure of investments in industry, many "agencies" declared bankruptcy. Subsequently, the foundation of banks gradually became more stable, and a relatively sound credit system gradually emerged. The Bank of Bengal in 1809, the Bank of Bombay in 1840, and the Bank of Madras in 1842 were established one after another, and their business operations were quite successful. Furthermore, since it was generally believed that banks made huge profits from issuing banknotes, the power to issue banknotes was transferred from the banks to the Indian government agency, acting as a representative of the Bank of England. To facilitate the circulation of banknotes, British India was divided into eight issuing districts. The circulation limit for banknotes was initially set at 40 million rupees, and by 1905, it had increased to 120 million rupees. This was the general situation of the Indian currency system before the First World War.

The currency system currently in use in India is twelve pies equal to one anna, and sixteen annas equal to one rupee. This is based on the gold standard system established before 1930. After the Bank of England implemented a gold blockade policy, the rupee was linked to the pound sterling, with a ratio of one rupee equal to one shilling and sixpence. Currently, the power to issue currency in India is in the hands of the Reserve Bank of India, which was established based on a special act passed by the Indian Parliament. The Reserve Bank of India uses pound sterling securities and government bonds as reserves. The British government prohibits the Reserve Bank of India from holding gold and silver. Indian people are extremely dissatisfied with India's current currency system. They believe that the ratio of one rupee equal to one shilling and sixpence is sufficient to hinder the development of Indian industry. They have repeatedly demanded that it be changed to one rupee equal to one shilling and fourpence to reduce the import of British goods into India, but the British government has refused. The fact that the Reserve Bank of India cannot hold gold and silver means that the economic life of the Indian people is in the hands of the British, who are seen as treating India as an exploited colony. From an economic point of view, it is easy to see why the Indian problem is so difficult to solve. (End of the complete India Problem Special)

Editor's Note on India Problem

The special issue ends today. According to our original plan, we wanted to systematically introduce various issues concerning India. However, India is a vast country, and relying on a few of us to extract some information from meager reference books can only result in superficial knowledge. Therefore, this special issue cannot be considered a success, and we should apologize to the readers. To meet the needs of our readers, we intend to publish special articles that are relevant to the times as much as possible. For example, the "Near East Countries Special" is currently being compiled, and an article on the "Alaska Highway" will be published tomorrow. We hope that readers who care about this newspaper will provide cooperation and guidance at any time, which would be greatly appreciated!

### The Trial of the Attempted Assassination of Papen Continues

Istanbul, Turkey, June 6th (Havas News Agency) The trial of the attempted assassination of Ambassador Papen continued this morning. The Soviet defendant, Juvid Kibelov, insisted that the main perpetrator (who was killed by the bomb he was carrying) was not necessarily Dugat, and that his true name was still under investigation. He requested the court to summon the following witnesses: 1) The deceased's parents and relatives, to compare the characteristics of the deceased's body; 2) Two police officers and two forensic doctors who were present at the autopsy; 3) The driver of the Soviet Consulate in Istanbul, as this person could prove that the defendant was bedridden during the time of the incident. The court refused the defendant's requests, stating that the identity had already been verified and there was no need for further investigation. The court then adjourned and postponed the trial to the 13th of this month.

### Applications for Citizen Certificates in the Public Concession Started Yesterday; Anyone Over Seven Years Old Can Apply

The Shanghai Municipal Council's Police Department, in order to maintain public order, decided to issue citizen certificates starting on the 7th. However, the photographs to be affixed to the citizen certificates required prior coordination with the local photography industry to ensure uniformity. This was completed yesterday, and 178 designated businesses in various districts have been assigned to start taking photos from yesterday. The collection period will be at least five days, so the issuance of citizen certificates will also be extended accordingly.

Two Types

It is understood that the citizen certificates issued by the Police Department are divided into two types: special citizen certificates and ordinary citizen certificates. Special citizen certificates are issued to those who meet the requirements stated in the notice issued by the Police Department's Baojia Department, limited to public officials, those who have made meritorious contributions to Baojia, and prominent members of society. These special citizen certificates do not have a red line. Ordinary citizen certificates are issued to the general public and have a horizontal wide red line printed on them.

Different Styles

The format of citizen certificates is as follows: (A) Special Citizen Certificate, approximately four inches long and three inches wide. The first line is printed with "(Municipal Council) (No. X) (Person Responsible)". The second line is the phrase "Special Citizen Certificate" in larger font. The third line is printed with "(Name), (Age)". The fourth line is printed with "(Address), (Occupation)". The fifth line is printed with "(Public Concession) (District), (No. X Lianbao) (No. X Bao) (No. X Jia), (No. X Household) (Proof of Residence)". The sixth line is printed with the date. The seventh line is printed with "Shanghai Municipal Council Police Department". The upper left corner has a square for attaching the photograph.

Printed with Red Line

(B) Ordinary Citizen Certificate. The first to fourth lines are exactly the same as the special citizen certificate, except that the second line only says "Citizen Certificate" without the word "Special". The fifth line, under "Shanghai District No. X Lianbao No. X Bao No. X Jia No. X Household," prints "Proof of Residence" and whether they are a member of the self-defense corps. The rest is the same as the special citizen certificate, except that there is a horizontal wide red line at the top of the citizen certificate, located at the neck. The paper of the certificate is strong and thick, and the printing is simple and beautiful.

Application Procedures

To obtain a citizen certificate, one must first obtain an application form and fill it out item by item, based on the information filled in the household registration form. Any citizen over the age of seven, regardless of gender, can apply to the competent police station. The application forms are issued by the police station to the Bao chiefs, who issue them to the Jia chiefs, who issue them to the household heads, who guide the residents of the household to fill them out, paste the photos, and apply for issuance.

### Letters to Europe and America Can Now Be Mailed, Limited to 25 Words Per Letter, Stationery Costs One Yuan Per Sheet

According to the English "Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury", residents of this city can now (7th) make contact with Europe, America, Africa, and Australia by mail for the first time since the outbreak of the Pacific War. The Shanghai branch of the International Red Cross has now accepted short messages limited to 25 words, to be forwarded to various parts of the world via Geneva. After this news spread by word of mouth, the International Red Cross branch at 97 Yuanmingyuan Road was crowded with people this morning, all seeking blank stationery to write these short messages. Each sheet costs one yuan in legal tender. Mr. Eaglier, the representative of the International Red Cross in Shanghai, told reporters this morning that all letters will be transported to Geneva via Siberia. The departure date of the first batch of letters from Shanghai has not yet been determined, but the authorities are now cooperating to ensure that the letters are sent out as quickly as possible within the possible range. Each recipient can only receive one letter, but Shanghai residents can send two letters to two recipients. The content of the letters is limited to personal and family matters, and no military or political events can be discussed. For example, the sender can write about their health or illness, or whether they are financially well-off, but cannot mention commercial situations or war. Recipients are limited to civilians, but many civilian recipients may now be in the military, so the letters can be sent to their civilian addresses. The limit of 25 words per letter does not include the names and addresses of the sender and recipient, it was said.

### Municipal Council to Levy Entertainment Tax, 30% Starting Today

The Shanghai Municipal Council's Information Office announced that the Council will, from today (Friday, May 8th), levy an entertainment tax of 30% on all entertainment venues such as theaters and cinemas. At the same time, the Council has determined that from today (May 8th), it will levy a bill tax on accommodation, food, and other entertainment provided by hotels, restaurants, dance halls, and teahouses.

This is collected in accordance with the measures set forth in Municipal Council Resolution No. 5878 of April 30th. Those who attempt to evade will be severely punished upon discovery.

### Unimportant Roads Blocked by Police

The authorities of the Public Concession, in order to ensure the security of the concession, are blocking unnecessary road entrances one by one, installing barbed wire fences. For example, the intersections of Avenue Edward VII and Rue du Route (in front of the Racecourse Apartments), Avenue Edward VII and Lungmen Road, and Peihai Road and Yu Qiaqing Road (in front of the Far East Hotel) have been erected with wooden stakes and barbed wire fences, permanently prohibiting passage. According to an announcement by the Central Police Station yesterday, the intersection of Yu Qiaqing Road and Rue Paker has also been erected with barbed wire, permanently prohibiting passage.

At around 10 o'clock, they rushed to Room 5 on the first floor of the hotel and arrested five male and female kidnappers, and rescued two kidnapped young women. The kidnappers were in the process of negotiating the price when they were all taken to the police station. During interrogation, the arrested kidnappers confessed to kidnapping and selling young women. It was also found that a large number of women kidnapped in the concession by these people had been sold to other locations. The police chief ordered them to be detained for further investigation before handling them according to the law. The two kidnapped women will be temporarily held pending notification to their families for their return.

### American Refugee Center Resembles a Paradise, Spacious Rooms, Lush Trees, Well-Planned Equipment and Management

On Route Petain, the most poetic street in the French Concession, there is an American refugee center. This place was originally a school building of the American School. After the outbreak of the Pacific War, it was transformed by the American Community Association and the American Red Cross into a place to accommodate poor American refugees. Currently, there are more than 150 men and women living here. Most of them became unemployed due to the war and have no means of support. They have to be provided with relief and supplies by the above two groups, but they have freedom of movement. It can be said to be a paradise for refugees. The general situation is as follows:

Lush Vegetation, a Paradise

The exact location of the American refugee center is 53 Route Petain, directly opposite the American Social Church. The buildings are spacious, and the surroundings are shaded by lush trees. At this time of spring and summer, being in it is like being in a secluded and elegant paradise. There is a building at the entrance, which is currently used as a gathering place for marshals. The security is tight, and it is not easy to enter. Behind the building is a large playground. Opposite the center is the office and classroom, which has now been converted into the main refugee center. To the right of the playground is the original school dormitory, which is no longer in use. The northeast corner of the school is a gym, etc., and the equipment is very complete. To the east of the school is an open space, which has now been opened up as a planting field. Only a patch of green can be seen, with people squatting on it. The scenery is especially beautiful at dawn or dusk.

Two Associations Manage, Enthusiastic Service

The refugee center is jointly managed by the American Community Association and the American Red Cross, with Mr. Anderson as the person in charge. The funds for all items are planned by the two associations, and the power to decide matters is also in their hands. There is a separate management structure in the refugee center, which implements the will of the association and the Red Cross and handles various affairs. The head is Etmudson, under whom there are several departments, some responsible for food distribution, some responsible for medical care, some responsible for security, and some responsible for planning entertainment, etc. They cooperate and complement each other. Some of the staff are paid, and some volunteer. Although their forms are different, their working spirit, service enthusiasm, and scientific management are rarely matched in refugee centers.

Eating and Lodging, Carefree

The refugee center is a three-story building, and the main facilities are inside, including offices, bedrooms, dining halls, lounges, libraries, toilets, and other sanitary equipment. The center is clean and tidy, and the layout is good, still retaining the characteristics of the school. There are more than 150 refugees in the center, mostly men. Their families mostly returned home after October of the year before last. They themselves stayed in Shanghai, and after the war, they became unemployed and lost their source of income. They were then assisted by American community organizations, fed and housed, and had no worries about life. There are also some Russian or stateless women who live in the center. They married US servicemen stationed in Shanghai before the outbreak of the Pacific War. When their husbands went to war and the war broke out, they claimed that they had obtained American citizenship through marriage and asked American community organizations to take them in and provide them with food and clothing. It is also an interesting story.

Falling on Hard Times, Sympathy for Each Other

The refugees in the center are not regulated by the center's authorities, nor are they forced to undertake any labor to contribute to production. Apart from homesickness, they can be said to have food and drink readily available, without any worries. Although the food is not "exquisite cuisine", it is simple and delicious. The main food is mostly cracked wheat, cracked rice, etc., which are all pre-war American Red Cross stocks. The quantity is limited, but the quality is excellent. The refugees in the center have freedom of movement, and there are no restrictions on going in and out, but they must declare the matter to the marshals. Except for eating, going to bed, and going out, most of the time is spent on sports, entertainment, and reading. The refugees naturally have different personalities, but their common experience creates a common interest. More than 100 people are like a family, which is a great pleasure in the world.

Swiss Consulate Handles Loans

In addition to providing food and lodging to the refugees, the American community also provides relief to the general poor American people who do not live in the center. The American Red Cross has specially prepared several tricycles to transport food to various sections of the concession every noon and evening to relieve the poor. The vehicles are black, similar in form to ordinary delivery vehicles, and are marked with the words "American Red Cross" in white. They travel in groups of two or three on the streets, attracting much attention. Recently, the American Community Association, under the supervision of the Swiss Consulate acting as a trustee, handles livelihood loans, so that the general people who have difficulty maintaining their livelihoods can get help. In recent days, the number of applicants has been extremely enthusiastic. The refugees in the center can also apply according to the regulations. Thus, with both food and lodging and loans, the refugees are transformed into "gentlemen".

Withdrawal of American Nationals

Recently, a large number of British and American officials and civilians from North China and South China have come to Shanghai to gather and wait for ships to withdraw. In addition to diplomatic personnel and consular officials staying at the Cathay Hotel and the International Hotel, most of the ordinary expatriates live in the American refugee center. Their meals are prepared by the center, but the cost is borne by other authorities. It is said that the cost is about 40 yuan per person per day. Everything for the American nationals in the original center is still borne by the American Community Association and the American Red Cross, and a portion is subsidized by the Washington government. The main source of funds does not exceed the scope of local donations. The refugee center has been established for several months. Because it is located in a remote area and lacks attention, and the responsible persons are buried in hard work and do not like to call for attention, external visits are generally rejected, so few people know about it.

### Pious and Devout, Frugal and Disciplined, Madam Xia Reaches the Age of One Hundred, Enjoying Simple Pleasures with a Lifetime of Dietary Restraint and Little Sleep, Obtaining a New Convert Even in Her Final Moments

Madam Bi, Mrs. Xia, the wife of Reverend Xia Zhishui of Ningbo, passed away at her Shanghai residence the day before yesterday (the 4th) at the age of 101. Such longevity is rare, rivaling that of the late Elder Ma Xiang. Yesterday, a reporter made a special visit to her close relative, Mr. Liu, to investigate Madam Xia's life story in detail, which is recounted below.

Helping Those in Difficulty and Rescuing Those in Need Madam Xia was from Cixi, Ningbo. She embraced religion in her youth and was a devout Christian. After graduating from a church school, she taught in the church, tirelessly educating others. In her spare time, she often went to the countryside to preach, propagating the truth of Christ. Later, she married Reverend Xia Zhishui and devoted herself to missionary work for forty or fifty years. She endured hardship and rescued those in need, even pawning her clothes to meet urgent needs.

Promoting Religion She bore six children and had two nephews, all of whom she supported and raised. She never hired a maid. Later, her children and nephews grew up one after another. They often gathered together for morning and evening prayers, piously observing religious services, instilling the truth of Christ, and promoting religion. The people of the Cixi area of Ningbo

The Solemn Funeral of Madam Xia Those who converted to Christianity due to Madam Xia's influence number no less than tens of thousands.

Three Bowls of Congee a Day When the reporter inquired about Madam Xia's secret to good health, it was said that there were no other health maintenance techniques. However, she ate and slept less than ordinary people. After the age of seventy, she began to drink congee. She ate thin porridge for three meals a day, and recently, only about a small bowl for each meal. She always got up before seven o'clock in the morning, reading the Bible with great interest, being content and always happy. When things did not go her way, she left everything to fate, constantly admonishing her children and nephews not to be complacent or irritable, taking it as their motto.

Eager to Learn Madam Xia always lived in the countryside of Ningbo. During the August 13th Shanghai Incident, her grandchildren welcomed her to Shanghai, where she resided at her nephew-in-law's house on Taras Road. Although she had five generations of descendants, her six sons had all passed away, and her grandchildren and nephews were scattered in various places, many working in the banking industry. Usually, Madam Xia was full of energy, walking as usual, reading, and writing as her daily work. In the past two months, she spent most of the day resting in bed. However, once awake, she would not put down her

A Glimpse at Her Final Moments According to Mr. Liu, his family employed a tutor, Ms. Han, who got along well with Madam Xia and had a deep emotional bond. They spent time together morning and evening. Madam Xia often encouraged her to convert to Christianity, but Ms. Han always hesitated and never did so. On the day Madam Xia was dying, her family members in Shanghai were all by her side, and Ms. Han happened to be there as well. At that time, she was still conscious. She stretched out her hand to take Ms. Han's hand and then passed away with a smile, her soul returning to heaven. Afterwards, Ms. Han, moved by her faith, resolved to become a Christian. Although Madam Xia had left this world, she gained a new convert even in her final moments, which is truly commendable.

### The Culprit in the Girl's Innocence Injury Case is Sentenced

(Huaguang News Agency) Zhang Bingsheng, a 38-year-old man from Jiangbei, worked as a sheet metal worker at No. 57, Avenue du Consulat. All repair work for St. Peter's Church at No. 37, Rue du Chemin de Fer, and the attached Xiaoming Girls' Middle School was handled by Zhang. Therefore, Zhang was familiar with the situation inside the church and knew that the storage room for the virgin girls was not locked. In February of this year, he sneaked into the church and stole 800 yuan in reserve notes and 26 sheets of sheet metal worth 7,000 yuan. He spent all the money in gambling dens. Afterwards, the French police detectives were dispatched everywhere, but Zhang avoided them by hiding in Hongkou, making it impossible to arrest him. Unexpectedly, last month, Zhang returned again and was discovered by five or six Chinese and foreign virgin girls in the church. Just as they were about to call for help, Zhang drew a sharp blade and stabbed them before fleeing without a trace. Finally, the French police sent detective Shao Guanrong to arrest Zhang, who was prosecuted for robbery. Yesterday afternoon, Zhang Bingniu was sentenced to three years and four months in prison for robbery.

### Impersonating a Lawyer, Using the Telephone to Defraud and Claiming to Initiate a Charity Fundraiser, Cai Fukang is Deceived of Two Hundred Dollars for Nothing

Mr. Cai Fukang has written to us, recounting a bizarre incident in which he was defrauded of a donation over the telephone. We are publishing it on his behalf as follows: On the 5th of this month, while on vacation at home, he suddenly received a phone call from someone claiming to be a certain lawyer. After exchanging greetings, the caller said that the colleagues' association was launching a charity fundraiser. The lawyer's name had several donations under his name, with three set amounts: Category A, 500 yuan; Category B, 300 yuan; Category C, 200 yuan. The caller stated that Mr. Cai was always charitable and generous, and asked him to choose a category and widely solicit donations among his close friends, which would be a great act of merit. Because of the lawyer's deep friendship, Mr. Cai found it difficult to refuse and chose the third category. At the time, it was stated that today was the May 5th holiday and the money would need to be delivered to the office tomorrow. Before the call ended, another call came, saying that Mr. Cai's office address was not very clear and requested that his home address be provided. Mr. Cai gave his address truthfully. The caller then said that they were collecting donations in the Hongkou area and, for convenience, hoped that the donation could be handed over to the collector to bring down, which would be appreciated. Under such circumstances, it was not long before a tea server-like person arrived with a receipt, along with a pair of silver flower vases as a gift. The person took the money and left. Later, it was observed that the receipt bore a rectangular seal of the colleagues and the signature was "Chen Runwu" and another rectangular seal. This donation was handled by a certain lawyer. The temporary receipt seemed to require a receipt with the lawyer's name. Since it was a charity donation, why give away silver vases? This raised suspicions. The next day, Mr. Cai called the lawyer to inquire, and the lawyer replied that there was no such thing, and he knew he had been deceived. It is believed that such things are not limited to Mr. Cai alone. This advertisement is to expose the fraudsters' tricks. Readers and philanthropists should not be deceived by these impostors again.

The English and American Hospitals and the Anti-Epidemic Committee Manage the Shanghai Times. The Japanese newspaper "Dalu Xinbao" reported yesterday (the 6th) that the English and American Hospitals and Sanatoriums in Shanghai, which were temporarily handed over to the Shanghai Anti-Epidemic Committee for management at the beginning of the war, will now be under the committee's management indefinitely. The work will continue. This was decided after discussions with the local authorities last Saturday. Therefore, the Anti-Epidemic Committee is now preparing a budget for its expenses and plans to increase hospital staff and provide sufficient medical supplies and equipment. It is believed that the general needs of each hospital will be met by the end of August.

### Carpenter Rapes Child Bride and is Sentenced to Five Years in Prison

Fan Linsheng, a 36-year-old man from Southeast Nanhui, works as a partner in a carpentry shop at No. 284, Fuxing Road. He is not yet married and usually lives and eats in the shop. The shop owner has a child bride, Lu Qiaoyun, who is 15 years old, from Suzhou, and is innocent, lively, and lovable. Fan sees her every day at work and became wicked. At the beginning of last month, Fan became sexually bold and used an iron chisel to open Lu's room door and forcibly raped her. The girl woke up in pain and was about to scream, but Fan pulled out a weapon and threatened her, forbidding her to make any noise, or he would kill her. The girl submitted from then on. Afterwards, Fan sneaked in every night and slept with the girl, never being discovered until the 17th, when the girl's aunt, Chen Shen, reported it, and Fan was arrested and sent to the police station. He was prosecuted according to law. Yesterday afternoon, Fan Linsheng was sentenced to five years in prison for continuous rape of a girl under the age of fourteen.

### Public Bonds Rise Again

Public bonds rise again. The public bond market temporarily stopped yesterday, and the market price slowly increased. People's hearts were stable, and there were slightly more transactions to cover short positions. The biggest drop the day before yesterday rose sharply as well. The market price turned to rise after discovering the smallest price on April 28th and 29th, and the pattern was bound to fall after the rise and then rise again after the fall. Recently, this is the situation. After the selling party once drained out, the market price was small, and when it slightly recovered, it was sold off again. The buying party took advantage of the selling and bought immediately, but did not raise the price. The short positions were covered after a big drop. The market price is therefore unstable. Fortunately, there is this, otherwise, the trend will continue to fall, which is not a small matter for the future of public bonds. The current trend is still in contention. Yesterday, the buying party bought more with No. 38 Dai Shenchang, and Chengkang, Renfeng, and Wuhe also absorbed a considerable amount. Runde, Xinhua, Shunli, and Tongshun also bought some. The market price rose by seven or eight jiao to one yuan and one jiao, and the transaction volume was about 600,000 yuan. The following is a simple table at the end, category highest lowest closing price compared to the previous day.

### Rumors of Mortgages are Inaccurate, Cash Rises and Slightly Returns

Yesterday, the cash market rose first and then slightly returned. The 22,000 yuan mark was not easy to cross. It was heard that after the news of the silver industry's acceptance of gold mortgages spread, it was suddenly found to be inaccurate. People's hearts turned from firm to stable. In the morning, each bar (+ two liang) initially rose by 300 yuan to 21,300 yuan because the cash numbers that had been selling hard recently suddenly came to pull in. Securities firms, silver firms, and a certain gang competed to absorb it, and the market price rose even faster to 700 yuan, peaking at 22,000 yuan, which was sold by gold firms and another securities firm. The rumors of positive news were inaccurate, and after 10 o'clock the price gradually fell. The last transaction price at 11:30 was 21,350 yuan, an increase of 350 yuan compared to the previous day.

Yesterday, the discount rate of the Money Industry Association rose by one point and was listed at one jiao. The discount rate for headed bills was as high as 22-23 yuan per thousand yuan, and then fell back to 15-16 yuan, which was slightly higher. The exchange rate between old and new legal tender was still 31.2 jiao.

### Increased Currency Types, Silver Industry Announces Complicated Procedures

The Shanghai Silver Industry Temporary Joint Council yesterday sent a letter to all firms, stating: "In accordance with the resolution of the meeting on March 9 of this year, it is hereby notified to all firms that all debts and payments before the 9th will be collected and paid in the old legal tender. From the 9th onwards, when accepting deposits, accounts should be opened separately for the old legal tender or Central Reserve Bank notes." In order to unify internal procedures and facilitate future identification, it was resolved to supplement the regulations as follows: "From May 11th onwards, all deposit slips, passbooks, or bills opened by various firms, as well as various loan contracts signed, should clearly state the words 'old legal tender' if the base currency is old legal tender (or 'old legal headed' for drafts). If the original document has the words 'national currency' printed on it, a stamp with the words 'old legal tender' can be added next to the national currency. The same applies to the use of Central Reserve Bank notes." "For all slips, passbooks, and contracts opened or signed after March 9th and before May 10th, even if they do not state the old legal tender or only use the words 'national currency,' 'legal tender,' or 'headed,' if the fact is indeed old legal tender, they should still be collected and paid in the old legal tender."

### Actual Sales are Not Smooth, Yarn Market Continues Downstream

The cotton yarn market continues to be sluggish. This is because the actual sales of spot goods are not smooth, which has softened people's hearts and inclined them downstream. 42-count Blue Phoenix was 13,500 yuan to 100 yuan, and finally 250 yuan. 40-count Caiqiu was 12,300 yuan, 40-count Riguang was 12,200 yuan, 60-count Blue Phoenix was 23,000 yuan, 40-count Baoguang was 10,350 yuan, 32-count Xiantao double-strand was 11,950 yuan, 60-count Wuzi was 350 yuan to 200 yuan, 20-count Yueqin was 6,580 yuan, 20-count Shuangma was 6,250 yuan, 20-count Shuangdiqiu was 6,390 yuan to 280 yuan, 20-count Tiannu was 6,280 yuan, 16-count Hongkuixing was 6,300 yuan, 18-count Zhinv was 6,250 yuan to 300 yuan, 10-count Hongshuangma was 4,800 yuan, 10-count Tongzijun was 4,750 yuan, 10-count Shuangdiqiu was 4,600 yuan, 16-count Jinqiao was 6,200 yuan, 60-count Xiongfeng was 6,200 yuan, 20-count Shuangmachangdan initially opened at 5,750 yuan. At this time, everyone on the table sold, and after a while it loosened to 5,670 yuan. After a slight turnaround, it fell to 5,560 yuan. The closing price rose slightly to 5,600 yuan. Currently, the yarn market may have a soft patch.

### Big Cotton Cloth Dealers Still Do Not Relax

The factory cloth market continued to soften yesterday, because the actual sales transactions were scarce, and the small merchants were willing to loosen their grip. However, the big bulls still insisted on not letting go, and even absorbed at low prices. 16-pound Diqiu coarse cloth was still bid at 260 yuan, Feihong at 246 yuan, 12-pound Dapeng fine cloth at 135 yuan, Diqiu at 226 yuan, Fugui at 30 yuan, 8-pound Zhenzhong at 132 yuan, Chuji Shilin at 350 yuan, and Taohuawu at 348 yuan, all with transactions.

Dongbu: The morning market continued to decline, and the after-market saw a slight rebound. Fine cloth fell by another two yuan compared to the previous day. The opening price of the new order for 12-pound Longtou fine cloth was 282 yuan, falling to 276 yuan, and the closing price at noon was 279 yuan. The afternoon started at 279 yuan, rising to 282.5 yuan, and closed with a weak but stable trend. The highest price for the Hongdan of the Four Gentlemen Serge was 9.3 yuan, the lowest falling to 9.067 yuan, and the closing price rose again to 9.29 yuan in the evening.

### Miscellaneous Grains Prosper and Suffer Together

Soybean trading decreased daily, because all the shopkeepers in this street were waiting for the controllers to allocate goods, so there were very few buyers, and the market was weak. Yesterday, 100 bags of Chongming sand silkworms were sold at a price of 130 yuan, and 30 bags of Sha Chi sold for 234.5 yuan.

Corn continued to sell well, and the owners were quite willing to sell, and the price was raised by another three or four yuan. Yesterday, 180 bags of Saigon new corn were sold at a price of 182 yuan delivered, and 180 yuan self-delivered. Wuhu corn was sold at 180 yuan to 78 yuan self-delivered for five carts, and road cargo was sold at 184 yuan.

Soybean cake's domestic sales were still slack, and floating holders slightly loosened, and the price was reduced by one or two yuan. It was calculated that the old warehouse order for the May Shenji soybean cake was 1,000 pieces, at a price of 56.75 yuan, and the old warehouse order for June was 2,000 pieces, at a price of 56 yuan. The new warehouse order for April was 5,000 pieces, at a price of 70 yuan to 69 yuan. The new warehouse order for March of Lizi Cake was 1,000 pieces, at a price of 67.75 yuan, and the new warehouse order for May was 500 pieces, at a price of 69 yuan.

Wheat bran supply and demand were both scarce, and only 300 bags of Sanxin large-package wheat bran were sold by floating holders at a price of 112 yuan.

### Hardware Slightly Active (Continued from the 6th)

2,000 pounds and 200 pounds of black iron billets were traded yesterday. Because of transportation difficulties and the difficulty of obtaining movement permits, it was difficult to develop business in other places. The transactions and activities in the market are all within this street. First purchased by printing factories, and then made by thermos bottle factories and small workshops, resulting in firm and rising prices. The market is optimistic. Yesterday morning, 13,500 yuan was sold, and the afternoon market was tight. The industry has a feeling of unwillingness to sell. 200 pounds of goods are sold for 1,400 yuan. Black iron sheet heads are another 1.200,000. The new Luo skin of No. 12 and No. 14 is another 1.400,000. The colored and appropriately added positive number steel miscellaneous skin is another 1.600,000. The positive number saw strip is another 1.600,000. The new foreign yuan square board is another 1.000,000. The colored and appropriately added new angle iron is another 1.200,000. Another Lao Xiong steel Shuangma steel box is 800 (to be continued)

### Match Monopoly Will Become a Reality; Thoughts on Stockpiling

Daily necessities have also been unusually sluggish recently. For example, representatives have been gathered to discuss matches. From today onwards, all companies will register their inventory with the association. Afterwards, Huazhong will distribute matches through the Military Match Association. 280 designated companies in this city will distribute them in accordance with the regulations. However, the goods are quite dry. For example, Huayang Factory has mostly suspended operations due to insufficient raw materials. Meiguang Factory has more inventory, and most of the rest have been sold out. The inventory of each factory is allocated for city sales. In the future, the continued production may require all original brands to be cancelled and unified trademarks to be used. There are rumors of names such as Peace Brand, which will be confirmed later. Observing the future match prices, it will be difficult to return to small profits. Generally speaking, it is a matter of time. The current market is weak due to sluggish actual sales, panic, and various suppressions, and everyone is trying to sell. Yesterday's market saw Beautiful Brand at 5,400 yuan per box, Phoenix Brand at 5,350 yuan, Gold Tripod Brand at 4,750 yuan, miscellaneous brands at 4,400 yuan, Gubenzao at 325 yuan, Bai Xiangmao soap at 295 yuan, Huang Xiangmao soap at 265 yuan, Arrow Knife soap at 280 yuan, and Bailishi foreign candles at 180 yuan. It's just like a tin pot… the only difference each day is that this day the pot is steaming with rice porridge, and another day there is no steam, no rice, and no porridge… Living in a difficult era, of course, material enjoyment is out of the question, but even the spirit is imprisoned and falls into the boredom and emptiness of the protagonist described in Chekhov's novels, losing the meaning and purpose of life. This must be a sad thing, right?

### A Cookbook

-- Zhu Ma

I once read a novel by Chekhov. It described the boring and empty lives of the middle class in old Russia. Chekhov borrowed the words of the hostess and said: "This life is like permanently studying a cookbook... The only difference each day is that one day we have soup and meat slices, and another day we have steamed vegetables and meat slices."

Because life's boredom and grayness, squalor and emptiness, are really the same, year after year, day after day, it is difficult to distinguish which day's life contains a different meaning from this day's. The only difference is the variety of side dishes.

Now, there are many people living this kind of life. However, although it is squalid and empty, they do not have the leisure of the characters in the novel to play cards, drink and talk about family affairs every day. They are troubled by rice, oil, coal, and firewood every day. They go to work like machines every day, but still cannot earn enough to feed their families. Often they come back to a scene of "father beating his son, husband scolding his wife." This kind of life that has lost its meaning and purpose, this kind of muddy river-like life, is now common in middle-class families.

However, we can't even say that there is anything different about the side dishes every day. We don't have to mention steamed vegetables and meat slices. A bowl of pickled vegetables and two yellow croakers are already lucky to be placed on the table day and night. However, this life is indeed like "permanently studying a cookbook," but the only difference each day is that one day we have indica rice, and another day we have corn porridge.

And there are those who live worse than that, who can't even talk about a "cookbook."

### Words of Wisdom

— Sun Dexiang

"Pride" is the precursor to "destruction"; the day of downfall is not far off for a person with an arrogant will. — Solomon

Your future success depends entirely on your preparations today. — Byron

The only good luck of great figures in the world is simply having the ability and determination to overcome bad luck. — Burke

### The Weather is Unpredictable

— Jin Yi

After eating fermented glutinous rice balls with eggs, the "modern feet" painted with "Kou Dan" nail polish are exposed outside leaky leather shoes (those who cannot afford socks should be called "barefoot"). Unexpectedly, three gusts of wind arrived collectively, whooshing fiercely. Needles to say, anything made of gauze or fine silk could not withstand such a fierce attack, even a single layer of woolen fabric would not be enough to fend it off. "The weather is unpredictable" probably refers to this kind of climate.

"The weather is unpredictable" is written in classical Chinese. Translated into vernacular Chinese, it is close to the saying "Man proposes, Heaven disposes," but the latter has a broader meaning, as it includes the climate and more. For example, making a fortune in Western medicine, but the accumulated medicine cannot cure the son's "illness" because the "illness" is a gunshot wound. Another example: going to the French park to "study" rice prices, brewing a pot of tea by the pond, watching the fish swimming in twos and threes, thinking it is a "safe zone," but still getting "robbed of a large crab and two large strings of cash." These examples all belong to the category of "Man proposes, Heaven disposes." It is also said, "Man has unpredictable misfortunes and blessings."

### Sharing a Boat in Stormy Weather

— He Jia Zhi

(4) In the Remaining Light of the Sun

Huanglong had one hand around Fei Changhe's neck again, and the other hand was pulling on one of his arms. It was almost as if Huanglong was escorting him in. When Weicheng saw it was Huanglong, he couldn't help but exclaim in surprise, "What's wrong! What's wrong!" Huanglong let go, and Fei Changhe stumbled forward, taking two or three steps before almost falling into the doorway. Huanglong's face was flushed red as he said, "This fellow, as he was leaving the front door, he was muttering under his breath. What did he say? He said: Fortunately that little devil Ye Weicheng is obedient, he always takes out money for me to use. Weicheng-ge's old man, how could it be him? How dare he call people a little devil? I, Huanglong, want to get it clear, and then give him a solid beating, to make him obedient." Fei Changhe had already experienced Huanglong's strength. His hand around his neck felt like a pair of pliers; his hand on his arm felt like a pair of shackles. He turned his head and said with a bitter face, "How would I dare to scold Young Master Ye? For his sake, I would even be your son." Huanglong spat at him, saying, "Bah! If I had a son like you, I simply wouldn't want to live."

Weicheng explained the situation to Huanglong, telling him not to bother arguing with him. He also said, "This is Sister Cuizhen's uncle. You should know Sister Cuizhen. For Sister Cuizhen's sake, you shouldn't bother arguing with him." Huanglong widened his eyes and said, "Hearing him scolding Weicheng-ge, it was like he was scolding my parents. I was filled with unhappiness. Hey! What's your name, Fei something, Fei Changhe. Listen here, when you go outside, no matter where you are, you cannot say bad things about Weicheng-ge. Besides, Weicheng-ge, there is nothing bad about him, yet you insist on saying he is bad, that is your fault. If you go out again and talk nonsense, I will hear about it. I want to test whether your river is long, or my ears are long." Fei Changhe said, "Who would say Young Master Ye is bad? Furthermore, I am raised by you." Huanglong stretched out his palm-leaf fan-like hand and grabbed Fei Changhe's neck again, grabbing the skin around his neck, which was thin and wide, raising it up two or three inches, and shouted, "Go!"

### The Usage Record of a Five-Yuan Note

— Cheng Weitao

"Your hair is so long again, why haven't you gotten it cut yet?" My mother said it all day long, saying I looked like a prisoner released from jail.

Because I had to attend a friend's wedding tomorrow, I had no choice but to visit the barber shop once again.

I received a five-yuan note from my mother. I thought, in this time of a shortage of small bills, the barber shop certainly wouldn't be able to make change. But my mother said to me, "Go buy some daily necessities first, and use the change to get a haircut."

"I want a box of Meili brand lighters." I threw the five-yuan note onto the counter of the sundries shop.

"Can't make change!" The shop assistant glared at me.

"Two boxes then." I thought, surely they could make change for something that costs two yuan and forty cents.

"Can't make change!" The other party still said the same thing.

"How much do I have to buy to get change?" I felt somewhat angry inside.

"At least three yuan and up."

I thought, now that second and third-class barber shops charge two yuan and ten cents, plus three cents for a shampoo, and one cent for a small tip is unavoidable, it would cost a total of two yuan and fifty cents. If I bought three boxes of lighters, it would cost three yuan and sixty cents, and they would give me one yuan and forty cents in change. Could I still go to the barber shop to get a haircut? So, without a word, I picked up the banknote and left.

I tried another shop, and another shop... The result was that I was very disappointed. Some required me to buy three yuan worth, and some even required me to buy four yuan worth to get change.

Never mind waiting for a while, I should just go home and get small bills to get a haircut. Just as I was returning to the alleyway, I ran into Sister Li from the front room. We talked about the shortage of small bills, and she said to me with a worried face, "Who knows, when I go to the vegetable market to buy vegetables, they would rather not sell anything without small bills. Today I went to the dried goods store to buy something, I gave them a ten-yuan note, and after buying eight yuan worth of goods, they only gave me two yuan in change. Tell me, is that not outrageous?"

"Sigh!" I couldn't help but sigh.

### Garbage

— Wen Zhen

In the garbage dump, one can see the recent lives of the people of Shanghai.

In the past, at this time, one would only see meat bones, prawn shells, yellow croaker bones, bamboo shoot skins, broad bean shells... red and green interspersed, very beautiful.

Now, even green vegetable leaves are not as many. It turns out that many families are drinking porridge for all three meals, and pickled radish and salted vegetables are enough to eat with rice.

A New Dream on Payday

In this torrent of wildly rising prices, the salaried class bears the brunt, oppressed to the point where they can hardly breathe. This is especially true for those in the education field, whose salaries have always been meager, let alone in this day and age.

Therefore, it makes me feel unfortunate to have been born to be a teacher, especially a teacher during this period, which is even more unfortunate. Living in chalk dust every day, emptying the stomach before eating, and when the end of the month arrives, I eagerly look forward to payday, as if I have a lot of money coming my way. However, when payday arrives, and I receive the money, I sigh, what is this money enough for? This contradictory psychology often floats in my mind.

The day before yesterday was payday again. As usual, I signed my name and received a stack of colorful banknotes from the principal's hand. Before payday, I was always expecting the salary to be paid out sooner, but when the banknotes were in my hand, tears almost flowed out. I desperately held them back, and a bitter smile floated on my face as I said to the principal, "This little bit of money is not enough to buy half a dan of rice." "Times are difficult, and there's nothing I can do, we cannot increase tuition fees mid-way," the principal also returned with a smile, expressing his sigh, as if sympathizing but without a solution.

Counting the money, I have one hundred and fifty yuan in banknotes in my hand, which I send home in full. Added to my wife's earned salary, it is still not enough to buy one dan of rice, let alone that there are five or six mouths to feed at home. Just for food, without other expenses, it might barely be enough, but there are still many things that cannot be dispensed with besides rice. Every day, I open the newspaper and look at the market prices, and they are always rising. At the beginning of the semester, according to our calculations, the money earned by both of us was enough to live a hard life, who knew that in two or three months, the crazy price increases would exceed expectations. Leaving the principal's office, I couldn't bear it after all, and two suppressed tears burst out.
