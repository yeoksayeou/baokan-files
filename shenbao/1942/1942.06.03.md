### Indian Government Announces Martial Law in Sindh Province

German External Sources Criticize Indian Situation, Believing Cooperation Between Britain and Communists is Highly Possible

Lisbon, 1st (Domei News Agency dispatch) - According to news from New Delhi, the Indian government announced martial law in the Sindh region on the Northwest Frontier yesterday. Berlin, 1st (Havas News Agency dispatch) - A recent article on the Indian situation published by the Japanese Hochi Shimbun was recently criticized by German external sources, stating that since the failure of Sir Stafford Cripps' mission to India, it is "highly possible" that Britain has turned to implement "full" cooperation with the Communist Party. The German government has received reports that the British authorities in India have recently released several Communists and organized a delegation of the Indian Communist Party to visit the Soviet Union. All of this is sufficient to demonstrate the policy that Britain is currently pursuing in India and to show that Britain is allowing the Soviet Union to act freely. In addition, it is well known that the Communist Party of Canada has become a cell within the army, which is a matter of great concern to all parties in Britain.

Berlin, 2nd (Havas News Agency dispatch) - For centuries, Britain's basic policy towards India has been to protect India's access from being blocked by continental countries. India is not only a market for Britain but also a source of manpower. The 2,000,000 Indian troops are of great benefit to Britain. Due to a lack of manpower, certain industries have been moved to the vicinity of Calcutta, India, which now produces approximately 1,500,000 tons of steel per year. The ammunition for the British forces in North Africa mostly comes from India. The United States is also trying to help mobilize India's manpower. The Allied countries' vast territory has fewer workers than Germany and its allies, so India's manpower is valued by the Allied countries. Britain has made huge investments in India, and if it were to be lost, Britain would suffer a great blow. However, the day the Japanese army knocks on India's door...

### Two, An Overview of Turkey (5)

The Symbolism of Three Treaties

From the time Turkey entered the war in 1914 until the new Turkey was completely transformed and domestic affairs were settled, there were three treaties in foreign affairs that symbolized a moving and praiseworthy history of Turkish revival.

The first treaty was the peace treaty signed by the Allied powers with Turkey after Turkey was defeated in World War I, commonly known internationally as the Treaty of SÃ¨vres. The full text of the treaty consists of thirteen chapters: every provision was harmful, and every clause was malicious. If this treaty were to be carefully analyzed, the harsh punishments imposed were simply more unbearable than national subjugation: territorial division, the stationing of foreign troops, restrictions on military strength, compensation for war expenses, etc. These clauses were all tearfully accepted by the moribund Constantinople government. This is enough to symbolize the natural death of the old and decaying Ottoman Empire. However, the National Government in Ankara refused to accept it and ignored it.

The second treaty was the Treaty of Lausanne, signed in November 1922 in Lausanne, Switzerland, after the Turkish army had swept away the Greek army. More than ten countries, including Great Britain, France, Italy, the United States, Turkey, and Greece, attended the meeting. The plenipotentiary representative of Turkey was General Inonu, the current President of Turkey. At this time, Turkey had just won the war, and its national prestige was greatly enhanced. The situation at the meeting was, of course, very different from that of Turkey in times of humiliation. At the meeting, Inonu did not listen to anything (Note - Inonu was hard of hearing) and overturned all the proposals of the Allied powers, resulting in the meeting ending prematurely and being declared a failure. After an eighty-day hiatus, the meeting was reopened through the mediation of various parties. The most gratifying aspect of the treaty established this time was that it eliminated all the unequal threats after the European War and abolished the privileges of the great powers in Turkey. The only deficiency was that the Dardanelles were designated as a demilitarized strait due to various factors. This treaty symbolized the reconstruction and revival of Turkey.

The third treaty was convened in Montreux, Switzerland, in 1936 by the signatories of the Treaty of Lausanne because Turkey's reforms had come to an end. This meeting focused on the issue of fortifying the Dardanelles Strait. As a result, Turkey can be said to have achieved its goal. One reason was that World War II was about to break out. Due to various factors, the great powers could only make slight modifications and formally sign the treaty. Another reason was that due to Turkey's thorough reforms, its national power was rapidly increasing, and the great powers had to look at it differently in the hope of winning it over in the future. The signing of this convention symbolized that Turkey had restored its long-cherished aspirations and become one of the great powers.

Decisive Reforms

Methods

After signing the Treaty of Lausanne, Turkey temporarily put an end to its foreign troubles. Looking back at the country, on the one hand, it was devastated by the Greek army, and on the other hand, the centuries-old autocratic rule had made the whole country corrupt. Therefore, it was necessary to carry out major reforms. Kemal had by this time become a dictator unanimously supported by the whole country, so he had to bear the burden of devoting all his energy to the work of reform and innovation. However, with so many tasks to be done, how should he start?

You and I do not need to worry about it. Kemal had already made up his mind. After taking office, the first thing he noticed was the old government in Constantinople and the Sultan. The old government was like a boil on the head, and the Sultan was like a piece of rotten flesh on the boil. Now that the new government had been established, the people followed it, and the great powers respected it, what was the use of these superfluities? So, in the winter of 1922, the National Assembly passed a resolution to cut off the boil. The Ottoman Dynasty, which had only allowed the Sultan to continue to hold the position of Caliph, came to an end. In the autumn of the following year, Kemal was elected as the first President of Turkey by a unanimous vote of the deputies.

### The Entire Eastern Front Situation Enters a Temporary Stasis

German Troops to be Transferred Elsewhere, Target Possibly Rostov

Bern, Switzerland, 2nd (Allied News Agency Dispatch) â The three-week-long spring offensive on the Eastern Front has now temporarily subsided. German and Soviet forces are establishing new positions to prepare for renewed, fierce fighting. According to a Soviet communique, there has been no fighting on any of the front lines.

German Command Headquarters, 2nd (Havas Agency Dispatch) â This afternoon, the German military communique stated that there were only localized battles on the Eastern Front. German dive bombers attacked Zhukovo and Murmansk, severely damaging a medium-sized cargo ship. In the Battle of Kharkov, Soviet Sixth Army Commander Golodtianko was killed. This information has been widely confirmed.

Somewhere on the Soviet Border, 1st (Havas Agency Dispatch) â An official communique was recently released stating that there have been no major changes in the battles on any of the front lines. However, according to reliable sources, German forces have reoccupied Tainilovka, a strategic point eight miles northeast of Kharkov.

Berlin, 2nd (Havas Agency Dispatch) â Military circles here describe the current situation on the Eastern Front as follows: From the upper reaches of the Donets River, southward from Taganrog to east of Kursk, east of Orel, and from Mius to Ilmen, Volkhov, and Leningrad, the situation has not changed significantly. The battles of recent weeks have only served to eliminate minor imperfections. The Soviet threat south of Kharkov has also been eliminated. Therefore, the period of consolidating our front lines has ended.

Berlin, 1st (Havas Agency Dispatch) â Military figures here say that the Battle of Kharkov and others have come to an end. The German High Command is about to transfer troops from that area to other theaters of operation. Currently, the entire war situation has entered a state of relative standstill, with only the air force remaining active. On the northern front, German aircraft frequently bomb isolated Red Army units. Enemy motorized columns, trains, communication lines, and bridges have been struck. Four enemy tanks have also been destroyed. The German Air Force also bombed several ships docked in the port of Murmansk, severely damaging a 7,000-ton cargo ship. A Soviet mine-laying ship was also hit in the Gulf of Finland. On the central front, German aircraft bombed various communication lines and enemy barracks. An important railway was hit, disrupting traffic. In the Donets region, German-Soviet air battles resulted in the downing of thirteen Soviet aircraft. Incendiary bombs were also dropped on factories and churches in the suburbs of Sevastopol.

### The Kharkov Plain: A Muddy Expanse

German Forces Attempting to Cross the River

Somewhere on the Soviet Border, 1st (Havas Agency Dispatch) â Regarding the fighting in the Kharkov area on the Eastern Front, conflicting reports from both German and Soviet sides make it difficult to ascertain the truth. Both sides claim satisfaction with the battles in the area. As for the fighting in the Donets region, it is also chaotic. German forces are attempting to repel Red Army units occupying bridgeheads on the left bank of the Donets. The Germans clearly intend to cross the river, but this will not be easy. The river is still swollen, the Kharkov plain is a muddy expanse, and the German forces have not yet fully concentrated in preparation for the crossing. Furthermore, the battlefield has not been completely cleared. Remnants of the Red Army are still putting up fierce resistance in various narrow pockets. The German High Command recently reiterated that the fighting in the Kharkov area should not be considered the start of a spring offensive. This is partly because General Bock, commander of the German forces on the southern front, intends to fully exploit his success in the Izyum area southeast of Kharkov to prevent the Red Army from reorganizing at its leisure and continuing its resistance on the left bank of the Donets. In the area northeast of Kharkov, German forces launched a strong offensive and recaptured positions lost last month, indicating that the Red Army's resistance has weakened. In addition, fighting in the Kaleri region is also very active. The German Air Force has not reduced its activities despite British air raids on German territory.

Stockholm, Sweden, 1st (Havas Agency Dispatch) â Military figures here state that the two major battles that have occurred on the Eastern Front this spring have both come to an end. The first is the Battle of Korsun, from May 8th to May 15th, and the second is the Battle of Kharkov, from May 12th to May 30th. The German achievement in the Korsun area was to secure a base for future offensives into the Caucasus. The German victory in the Kharkov area resulted in the destruction of a large number of Red Army troops, but there were no major changes in the front lines, and the Red Army did not lose its fighting ability as it did in the previous campaign in Ukraine. However, the Red Army has completely lost the initiative in the Kharkov area. Currently, fierce fighting is only occurring in the Izyum area, where German forces are attempting to push the Red Army back to the east bank of the Donets River. As for future German actions, it is generally believed that after the Battle of Kharkov comes to an end, they will begin an offensive against Rostov. At the same time, battles may also occur in other areas of the Eastern Front. According to Soviet claims, the Germans originally intended to launch a major offensive in the Kalinin area. German tank units and the air force have repeatedly bombed Red Army units, but each German attack has been repelled. However, the exact locations of the front lines are difficult to ascertain. Generally speaking, the town of Elnya is the center of activity. A German division has been surrounded by the Red Army in that area since February 6th. In recent months, the Red Army has not attempted to retake the town but has instead established a fortified position near it. The purpose of the German offensive is to put the German forces occupying Elnya in a more advantageous position. In addition, a recent article in the Stockholm Times criticized the military equipment of both Germany and the Soviet Union. The article stated, "After the German victories in the Korsun and Kharkov areas, we do not believe that the German High Command will cease all major actions. In these two major battles, the Soviet Union mobilized a large number of Red Army troops and a large amount of military equipment, but they were all shot down because of the German strategic superiority. The Soviet heavy tanks used this time, especially the 03-4 type tanks, weighed fourteen tons. On the German side, various steel weapons were also used, and it is said that the German victory in this battle was due to this."

### British Cruiser HMS Trinidad Sunk in the Arctic Ocean

One of Britain's Newest Light Cruisers

London, 1st (Havas Agency Dispatch) â The Admiralty has recently released a communique stating that the British cruiser HMS Trinidad has been sunk in the Arctic Ocean. This cruiser had a displacement of 8,000 tons, entered service with the fleet in 1939, and had a speed of 33 knots. While escorting merchant ships carrying military supplies to the Soviet Union on May 29th, it engaged in a naval battle with German warships in the southern Barents Sea and sustained heavy damage.

Stockholm, Sweden, 2nd (Havas Agency Dispatch) â According to reports from London, the British Admiralty announced last night that the British light cruiser HMS Trinidad (8,000 tons) has been lost. The ship was damaged by German warships while escorting British merchant ships in the Barents Sea on March 29th. The ship's commander was Captain Sanders.

A Turkish delegation, including technicians and officers, arrived in Germany a week ago to discuss detailed arrangements. Turkey will ship copper and other military materials to Germany. Germany will loan 100,000,000 marks to Turkey. Political figures here believe that this commercial agreement demonstrates Germany's desire to strengthen Turkey's neutral position. Turkey can use German war materiel to cope with various contingencies. The details of the commercial agreement will be completely finalized in a short period of time. This is a sign of the exceptionally harmonious relationship between Germany and Turkey.

### The Kharkov Front: A Replay of the Battle of Verdun (Part 2)

On the Banks of the Donets River

We've digressed a bit too far, so let's get back to the topic at hand! We've talked about the Kharkov area, so now let's say a few words about the city of Kharkov, the heart of this area. The name should not be too unfamiliar to readers. When you open the daily war news from Germany and the Soviet Union, you almost always come across this word. This is the place where the two sides are currently fighting the most fiercely. Ever since the time of Imperial Russia, Kharkov has been regarded as a military stronghold, just like Moscow and Leningrad have strategic importance. This is because it is not only a key city for reaching the Transcaucasus but also the center of the black earth belt. Understanding this, it should not seem too strange to us that the German and Soviet sides are fighting so hard this time.

Kharkov has a history that is not too short. The city was founded in 1650 by the Cossack Kharikof, and its current name is used to commemorate him. It is located on the banks of the Donets River. Due to its strategic location, it was designated as the capital of Ukraine in 1780. After the overthrow of Imperial Russia, it remained the capital of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic. In the era of Imperial Russia, it had a population of 130,000, which has now increased to over 700,000, making it the fourth largest city in the Soviet Union after Moscow, Leningrad, and Baku.

Kharkov is a railway hub, with railways leading north to Moscow and south to the Black Sea coast. It is also a necessary stop on the route from the Soviet capital to Crimea. It is a famous commercial metropolis in southern Russia. Every year, farmers from all over Ukraine gather here on time. On market days in Kharkov, you will see those ridiculously dressed villagers bringing their year's harvest to trade. Since the Soviet Union implemented the New Economic Policy, small transactions can be freely bought and sold. They mostly sell flour and leather, and they also bring herds of livestock. On the market square, the shouts of people and the neighing of cattle and horses are mixed together, which is very lively. After dark, when the transaction is over, this is the happiest time for the farmers. Most of them are flushed with drink. If it is a good day, they dance with the simple and healthy village girls along the square. A group of unskilled musicians excitedly play the four-stringed lute, and the farmers sing harmonious tunes in time with the rhythm. They often make such a fuss all night long.

Painted with New Colors

In the keen sense of a poet, Kharkov is a gray city. If an artist from the Mediterranean coast travels here, I think he will be disappointed. He will say, "Kharkov? What a lonely and remote place!" Yes, it is slightly lonely for a tourist. The Donbass coal mine is located on the banks of the Donets River, near Stalino, and produces more than 100 million tons of coal per year. There are several newly discovered coal mines, which are the famous black earth towns of the Soviet Union. Indeed, it has a bit of a lonely taste. There are no quaint and artistic buildings here, and the characters here do not have the delicate and soft lines that we are used to seeing. After the revolution, Kharkov was completely painted with a new layer of new colors. What it has are wide and long avenues, neat and patterned buildings, chimneys, workers in blue uniforms, and trucks rolling on the streets all day long. And that gray sand: what annoying gray sand! Spring should be a beautiful season, but the sky above Kharkov is soaked in a thick layer of gray. A gust of wind blows, and the dust on the street will be rolled up several feet high, misty and vast, so that you, a person from afar, will be disturbed and depressed.

Kharkov is now a concentration of heavy industry. There are countless newly built flour mills and metallurgical plants here. All you can hear all day long is the heavy breathing of machines. When the work is over, the streets and alleys are crowded with all kinds of workers, like snakes slithering into a string. There are older people and women among them. Their faces are healthy, and the heavy work has not damaged their amiable temperament. On holidays, they sing songs along the way. In theaters or parks and other public places, their footprints are always indispensable. They are so happy and enjoying themselves.

Kharkov does not have ancient churches, and even if there are, they will not arouse your special interest. Places like parks and museums are naturally indispensable, but in your opinion, they are not very interesting. The only old building in this city should be Kharkov University, which was built in 1850 and will soon be 100 years old. Only from the dimly colored brick walls of the house left over from the last century can you smell a trace of the passing years, just as you can calculate how long this city has been. This university is the center of Southern academic, and every year it produces a large number of excellent talents. In order to meet the needs of the local area, the engineering department is the most outstanding, and the medical and law departments are naturally not bad.

Kharkov's neighbors, such as Stalino and Rostov, are also famous industrial centers. This is the Soviet Union's Ukrainian Sorotehinta market situation manufacturing plant for wartime goods. However, with the shift of the war, many places have successively fallen. Now, on the top of Kharkov, there should be the wings of flying crows circling, and the whistling of shells will also inject a lot of fresh embellishments into the air. A poet would probably no longer have time to sigh and say, "Kharkov is lonely enough!" I think he would be paralyzed by the symphony of that great battle.

After The Outbreak Of The Greater East Asia War On December 8th Of Last Year, Until The Beginning Of February This Year, They Were Indicted By The Shanghai Japanese Military Police. Now I Will Briefly Record The Resumes Of The Main Figures and Details of Their Activities.

However, In The Past Two Days, There Were Rumors That Banknotes Issued By Shen Zhong Jiao After The 29th Year, As Well As 50 Yuan and 100 Yuan Denominations, Were All On The List of Rejections. The Central Reserve Bank Authorities Have Now Responsibly Stated That All Banknotes From The Central, Chinese, and Communications Banks, Except Those Not Accepted As Stipulated in Article 1 of The Detailed Measures For Recalling Old National Currency Published By The Banks, Banknotes Issued After The 29th Year, And 50 Yuan and 100 Yuan Denominations, Are Generally Allowed To Be Accepted For Exchange.

Najian Talks The Espionage Plot Group Indicted This Time Used The Two Concessions As Its Base Before The Japanese Army Entered The Concessions, And Was Secretly Active Under The Protection Of The Chen Government. Beforehand, The Military Police Authorities Had Spent A Great Deal Of Effort And Time Investigating This Plot Group. The Main Purpose of The Group's Initial Organization Was Economic Strategies Against Germany, And Later, As The International Environment Deteriorated, It Gradually Focused On Inciting Activities Against Japan. If Their Planned Schemes, Such As Destroying Important Facilities In Shanghai, Arson Plots, Or Evacuating Nationals And Young Residents of Military Age To The Area Under Yu's Control, Were To Be Realized, It Would Not Only Affect Public Security in Shanghai, But Also Increase The Power Of Yu's Resistance Forces. This Time, They Were Prevented In Advance From Implementing The Espionage Propaganda Strategies Against Japan And Germany They Were Planning, Which Is Something That Japan And Its Ally, Germany, Can Truly Celebrate. Another Feature of This Espionage Group Is That It Recruited Branch Members From Various Classes. Those Who Participated In It Were All Influential People Who Were Quite Familiar With The Situation In China Or Japan, Spending Huge Sums of Money On Activities, Using Their Positions To Directly Or Indirectly Use The Hands of A Majority Of Chinese And Foreigners, Trying To Gradually Extend The Magic Hand of Espionage Strategies To The Japanese Side. The Ring Leader Garnett Was A Well-Known Pro-Japanese Person. From This Point of View, Japanese People Who Hope To Interact With Foreigners Should Be More Cautious And Vigilant In The Future. The Military Police Authorities, In View Of The Experience of This Incident, Will Further Strengthen The Suppression of Such Unscrupulous Elements, And At The Same Time Maintain Close Contact With Relevant Parties, In Order To Prevent Problems Before They Arise.

### Large Number of Extortionists Sentenced Separately

After a long period of investigation, it was learned that these individuals specialized in intimidating various gambling dens with threatening letters. If their wishes were not fulfilled, they would resort to throwing explosives. Most of the major gambling dens in Shanghai had received such letters. Among them, one of the criminals, Huang Jinshui, on October 31st of the 29th year of the Republic of China, colluded with three accomplices to attempt to shoot and murder Wang Dabao at 285 Wuchang Road.

### Typist Attempts Fraud, Fails

Xu Zhiliang, a Mudi person residing at No. 42, Lane 228, Parker Road, was a typist at the Municipal Council Donation Office. One day at 4:15 PM, Xu was loitering at the Maokang Money Shop at No. 282 Jiangxi Road. At that time, Sun Jingde, a staff member of the Huikang Silver Shop at No. 342 Sichuan Road, was selling 1,000 yuan of Japanese military scrip to Maokang, with a limited price of 11 yuan of old currency per yuan. Xu immediately impersonated a Maokang employee, accepted Sun's military scrip, and told him to wait a moment while he went to get the money. Sun, suspicious due to recent fraud cases, followed Xu closely, preventing him from escaping. After Sun discovered the truth, he blew a whistle, and members of the self-defense team apprehended Xu, confiscating the original stolen military scrip worth 1,000 yuan and taking him to the Central Police Station. Hua Detective Han Shoushan investigated and confirmed that Xu intended to commit fraud. He was taken into custody pending further investigation.

### A Casual Discussion of Ten Cantonese Restaurants

â A Regular Customer

Recently, in the economic news section of newspapers, even the stocks of restaurant businesses are actively traded among Chinese merchant stocks. In terms of stocks, this is undoubtedly a brand-new commodity; in terms of the restaurant industry, it is an unprecedented grand undertaking. This has piqued the curiosity of reporters. Regardless of the emergence of the New Capital Restaurant's stock and its impact on the restaurant, the fact that the restaurant business has recently attracted the attention of general merchants, no longer treated with contempt, is a kind of progress. Originally, the hotel and restaurant businesses should not be considered "lowly." In ancient times, our great prime minister Guan Zhong first managed "inns" and then governed the country. The U.S. Bureau of Commerce had already listed this business as one of the top five national industries ten years ago. I believe that a group of big entrepreneurs in Shanghai may use even greater efforts to develop this still-fertile land. Based on these intentions, the reporter spent five days investigating and providing a simple description of several first-class restaurants in Shanghai.

The Development of the New Asia System

These first-class restaurants are almost all Cantonese restaurants. Other local cuisine restaurants, and even Western restaurants established by Chinese, are far behind in terms of capital, equipment, personnel, cuisine, and other aspects. Therefore, if we talk about first-class, Cantonese cuisine is almost "unanimous." This unanimous group consists of New Asia, New China, Beijing China, Red Cotton, American China, Golden Gate International, Glory China, South China, and the New Capital Restaurant, which is about to open and has already caused a sensation in Shanghai, coincidentally forming the "Ten Greats." If we want to find the common points of first-class restaurants, in addition to the above-mentioned appearance of being hailed as "the most upscale Cantonese restaurant," there is an even more important "similar content" that outsiders cannot know well. That is the "development of the New Asia system" that I am about to propose. Originally, there was a very famous "Grand Hotel" on the head of North Sichuan Road before the war, called "New Asia." I think everyone remembers that in its heyday, important figures in Beijing and Shanghai, as well as political and business tycoons, all took this place as their resting place. The manager of this Grand Hotel, Zhong Biao, not only contributed to the hotel but also benefited from the legacy. And look, among the above-mentioned top ten restaurants, except for New Asia International and Golden Gate, the managers of the other seven are all senior staff of New Asia at that time, namely, Guan Jichuan of New China, Liang Hansheng of Beijing China, Huang Tingwei of Red Cotton, Wu Xiaoxiang of American China, Cai Guozhong of Glory China, Wang Dingyuan of South China, and Li Xianying of New Capital. What's more, in addition to the above-mentioned personnel, there are also Zhou Lanfang, the chief steward of New Asia, Xiang Ru, the foreman of Golden Gate (whose surname is unknown), and Li Bowei, Cui Shuping, Shen Ruiyuan, Huang Jilin, Wu Fahua, etc., who are in charge of each store, all "famous generals" of New Asia. Although "New Asia" has become a historical term, and Zhong Biao himself is living in the uncompetitive "Glory China," very unwilling, judging from the above lineup, New Asia is worthy of being New Asia, and Zhong Biao is worthy of being Zhong Biao.

New Asia, Glory China, and New China

Many people say that New Asia on Great Horse Road cannot be listed as first-class because its "utensils" are ordinary, its "seats" are too crowded, and even its "materials" are inferior, and its "waiters" are sloppy. In fact, according to the reporter, the above points are indeed facts. Compared with Beijing China and Red Cotton, it is indeed inferior, but it is located in the "city center" of Nanjing Road, so merchants gather there. It has a huge lineup of more than a hundred chefs, so the dishes are served the fastest. And it has a well-compiled menu and air conditioning suitable for summer, which other stores cannot match. Therefore, with its not-so-large seating, its daily business reaches 30,000 yuan, occupying the highest sales record for a long time (other stores probably have about 20,000 yuan per day), which is definitely not accidental. By the way, talking westward to Glory China, although it and New Asia are both on Nanjing Road, their business is incomparable. At the same time, although Glory China is personally managed by veteran Zhong Biao, it is difficult to find its strengths, and its shortcomings, such as "the facade resembles a modern pawnshop," "most of the waiters lack outstanding talents," and "the lack of light and air downstairs," make it impossible for Commander Zhong to use his talents. It is said that the business has recently shown a slight improvement, which depends on the "twilight" of old man Zhong Biao. Turning around and running into New China on Guangxi Road, this old store among the younger brothers is still full of energy. It is said that only a capital of more than 10,000 yuan was spent when it was founded. At the current market price, it can only buy five tons of bituminous coal or sixteen dan of white rice. Therefore, all the shareholders are fully loaded. Taking capital to seek profit, and reinvesting profit into capital (has expanded shares several times). As for the cuisine, it can only fight alongside Glory China in the top ten recently. The famous dishes that used to be popular, such as braised fish and Portuguese chicken, are probably tired of eating by Shanghai people. What's more, they are everywhere, and more is not surprising.

Beijing China's Liang Bing and Red Cotton's Huang From Guangxi Road straight to Four Horse Road, entering Beijing China. The biggest feature of Beijing China is the good skills of chef Liang Bing. The four hot stir-fries are especially "beautiful to the eye, beautiful in the eyebrow." It is said that if interested people go to eat four of Liang's "hot stir-fries" every day, they can avoid frying "cold rice" in a month. It is really "full of tricks" and amazing. Therefore, its sales are always in the second, third, and fourth place. Liang Bing's contribution is higher than everything. Also, Beijing China's curry chicken buns are better than anyone else's. This point should be specially introduced. Unfortunately, it is now probably also affected by pearl rice noodles. Leaving Four Horse Road to the Great World, visiting Red Cotton. The difference between Red Cotton and the above three is that the store is capitalized by local people and made by Cantonese, which is somewhat different from the purely Cantonese help of the above three. The reporter specifically wants to point out this point to explain that the local people started investing in Cantonese restaurants, and the chairman of Red Cotton, Mr. Sheng Pihua, was the first. Mr. Sheng had a very keen vision. At that time, in Zhong Biao's base camp, he picked Huang Tingwei from the five tiger generals. According to Mr. Huang's experience and talent in handling affairs, he is indeed superior. Regardless of internal affairs and diplomacy, he can be called the leader in the circle. The success of New Asia in the past can also be said to be Huang's great contribution. Although Red Cotton's location is not good, and it is subject to external "high price" slander, it actually occupies the fifth place in the sales record of the top ten, which can be called extremely "accepting adversity." Speaking of Red Cotton, I want to complain about "expensive" for Red Cotton. Many people say "Red Cotton's price is too expensive." In fact, scientifically speaking, Red Cotton is expensive, but not as expensive as ordinary people think. In fact, the difference in pricing among these stores is less than one yuan. However, the reason why Red Cotton shows people that it is expensive is that, first, when it first opened, some famous dishes were indeed more expensive, but recently, due to the inflation relationship, the difference with other stores is not much. The second reason is that the guests are too generous. They sit down and don't look at the menu price list, and the waiters are too good at doing business. Hearing the guests say "You can order a few dishes," they fill the table with "abalone slices" and "lobster." Looking back, two people ate 336 yuan and four corners. Therefore, diners must be careful. Entering the country, asking about the ferry, sitting down, and telling the waiter to bring a "price list" to ensure that you will not overdraw from the "wallet bank."

Jingan Temple Road Running Eastward

From Red Cotton, driving west, reaching American China at the mouth of the alley. The most lovely thing about American China is its appearance rather than its content. The magnificent and generous facade, the steamship-style roof, the upscale neighbors, and the spacious parking lot, all show its "big family" style. In fact, the interior is not decorated carefully and is definitely not the opponent of Red Cotton and Beijing China. However, the fairness of American China's price and the spaciousness of its seats cannot be matched by other families. Another difference between American China and other families is that American China is a step further than Red Cotton. It is a Cantonese restaurant invested by local people and managed by local people. The chairman is Mr. Li Zulai. American China is facing west, and there is no first-class restaurant, so it runs eastward towards Jingan Temple Road. The first one arrives at International. In addition to the "International Hotel" brand, International Chinese Restaurant also has the first-class condition of being more comfortable and luxurious than any other restaurant. The chief steward, Mai Chao, used to be the top chef of the old "New Capital Restaurant." He also has many famous generals under him. International's eastern neighbor, Golden Gate, has excellent business under the leadership of Zhong Jiahe. This Mr. Zhong is even more powerful than the above-mentioned Mr. Zhong. It is said that he put down his scissors (formerly the manager of Jiahe Store on Nanjing Road) and picked up a kitchen knife, still dancing in long sleeves. Regardless of "ceremonial dress," "wedding wine," clothing, food, housing, and transportation, he can be said to be "an expert in every industry." Stepping out of Golden Gate and returning to Nanjing Road, reaching the rising star South China. As of now, South China has the largest capital among several families. From 15,000 for New China, to 70,000 for Beijing China, to 100,000 for Red Cotton, to 200,000 for American China, to 400,000 for Glory China, South China is 600,000. And its layout is unique, that is, investors and managers, Guangdong locals each account for half. South China relies on extensive communication, and its recent business is only lower than New Asia. The facade decoration and interior layout are all at a high price. The director, Xu Datong, is probably well-known to Shanghai people.

This Article Ends Talking About New Capital

Leaving South China, we can soon go to New Capital for dinner. New Capital is an old store that has been newly opened on the sixth floor of the New-New Company, in the area where there used to be a glass radio station. Like International Golden Gate, it faces south and is modern, facing New Asia, South China, and New Glory. Therefore, before the reporter investigated the inside story of New Capital, and suddenly heard that before its opening, the shares had risen from a face value of 100 yuan to 164 yuan, he couldn't help but sweat for the stockbrokers. But the stockbrokers are, after all, stockbrokers. It turns out that they had already "calculated thoroughly" before me. According to the reporter's investigation from all parties, this Cantonese restaurant can indeed be called unprecedented in all aspects, because it has innate strength, and there is naturally a possibility of improvement in the future. The capital, only in the Chinese restaurant part on the sixth floor, is prepared with a fixed amount of 1.6 million, and a working capital of 500,000. The Western restaurant part on the seventh floor is also prepared to be fully revised by the company with an appropriation of 1 million. The personnel, according to the investigation, are to bring together the best elements from the above nine families to perform. Just talking about the kitchen front, it will break any record, bringing together three chief stewards and four second stewards from the first-class Cantonese restaurants in Shanghai to form the first line of defense, and then recruiting the chief stewards from the second-class restaurants to form the second line of defense. As for the waiters, it is probably also the lineup calculated by the above formula. Speaking of the latest type of streamlined seats, the utensils all belong to the supreme products that do not hesitate to pay a high price. Air conditioning, water ting, lighting, and music are all perfect. And it is especially said that the raw materials needed were mostly purchased early last year. If so, in terms of cost, the future pricing should not be too high. What's more, the precise planning and good management of the chairman, Li Ze, and his reputation and reputation, are well-known in the contemporary era, and his future is unlimited.

### Municipal Council Orchestra Reorganized Separately

The matter of the Municipal Council Orchestra being taken over by a Japanese music organization has been confirmed by Kawasaki, a spokesperson for the Japanese Embassy, at a routine press briefing the day before yesterday. After the team is cut down, it will not be disbanded and will continue to operate as usual, but it must be reorganized and renamed the Shanghai Orchestra" (Shanghai Philharmonic Orchestra), managed by the Shanghai Philharmonic Society" (Shanghal Philharmonic Soolety).

Naming

It is said that the Municipal Council Orchestra has a long history and outstanding achievements. Once it is cut down, it will be a major blow to music lovers. In view of this, various cultural groups in Shanghai have jointly established a new organization to take over the orchestra and rename it the Shanghai Orchestra. If the members of the Municipal Council Orchestra apply to the Shanghai Music Association, they can still join the new orchestra.

Plan

Although the specific work plan of the new orchestra has not yet been determined, it will be performed publicly in the north and south districts of Suzhou River in the future. It is heard that a trial method has been drafted, and performances will be held once a week in the north and south of Suzhou River. When asked whether Percy, the conductor of the Municipal Council Orchestra, will still assume his original position, he replied that technically, the original team of the Municipal Council Orchestra will remain unchanged, but it is not known whether Mr. Percy will apply to join the new orchestra.

Lineup

The Shanghai Music Association is chaired by Tesumi, who is responsible for reorganizing the Municipal Council Orchestra and planning the future work of the new orchestra, while expanding the lineup. It is also learned that most of the "music fans" in this city hope that concerts will still be held frequently in the summer and winter of this year. Some people also said that the cutting down of the Municipal Council Orchestra, from an economic point of view, does not need to be taken over by others, because music lovers are more willing to be guests at the orchestra's performances, so the box office revenue may make the orchestra a self-supporting institution.

Funding

As for whether the French Concession Board of Directors and the Italian Concession Board will continue to fund the orchestra, it is not yet known, and it has not been heard whether the Municipal Council will still provide considerable subsidies. However, according to the Municipal Council's budget this year, the Municipal Council Orchestra can still get five months of funding, totaling 251,600 yuan. This fee is mainly used to disperse the members of the team when it is cut down.

### Zhou's Fragrant Snow Garden Opens

Cultural figure Zhou Sujuan, tired of language and writing, devoted himself to gardening. Last month, he jointly opened a bonsai exhibition with Mr. Kong Zhiqing, which achieved remarkable results. The Nanjing Road New Asia Restaurant authorities heard of his name and specially invited Mr. Zhou to use his exquisite bonsai as window decorations, which has been more than ten days, and everyone who sees it praises it. Now, with the help of his old friend Mr. Wu Lingyuan, Mr. Zhou has taken the garden at No. 27 Carter Road as the location for the Fragrant Snow Garden, with his son Zheng (a high-achieving student in the agricultural science department of Nantong College) assisting in everything. It is scheduled to open at 2 p.m. on the 3rd of this month (every day from 10 a.m. to 7 p.m. thereafter), welcoming visits from all walks of life. There are many old camellias hidden in the bonsai, with the four characteristics of "purity," "strangeness," "antiquity," and "bizarreness," each with unique postures. Bonsai such as "Purple Bamboo Forest," "Mi Dian Worshiping Stone," "Seven Sages of the Bamboo Grove," and "Thousand-Person Stone on Tiger Hill" are all full of poetic and pictorial meaning.

### Second Sino-Western Football Match China United Greatly Defeats Portugal Yesterday

Result Six to Two First Half Four to One Wu Qixiang Participates Portuguese Team Lacks Strong Players

The second act of the Sino-Western football trial match, China United vs. Portugal, met at the Racecourse Stadium at 5:30 pm yesterday. China United won 6 to 2, leading 4 to 1 in the first half. The enthusiasm of the situation was no less than that of the battle against North West Children. In yesterday's game, China United got Wu Qixiang to help, like a tiger adding wings. It is a pity that Yuan Jian was late, and Cao Qinfang was changed to the left wing. Chu's talent was used, and there was no regret. The famous players of the Portuguese team, Cola Shavik, Tai V, and Su Ruojun, did not come to the arena. Otherwise, the battle would be more intense and exciting with Oliveira and others. Referee He Chunhui, linesmen Deng Xiaoliang and Zhang Zhiren, China United Qin Bikai, Zhang Banglun, Zhuang Youren, Zhang Linggen, Zhang Zhaohong, Han Longhai, Chen Xiaoping, Yuan Kun, Tian Cao Qinfang, Wu Qixiang, Dai Linjing, Jia Xingliang, Fei Chunhua, Dong Portugal Ke Lunsi, Sheriff Neto, Paulo, Lei Miyouni, Sida Bulate, O Chai Liao Gaien, Fafan Xiao, Luo Chai Liao, Mai Quezhus

First half

After the battle began, China United dialed the ball first. Youliang diverted the tiger away from the mountain and penetrated deep into the hinterland. With one kick, he sent the ball to the center. Qixiang pressed it and swept it, but unfortunately it was biased. After ten minutes of melee, Youliang launched the attack again, dialing the ball to the penalty area. Ah Dai was as light as a swallow, firing a shot with a backhand, and the record was opened (one to zero). In 22 minutes, Chunhua was in the center, Qixiang shot a shot, Youliang stood up to meet him, held the ball and rushed in, China United won another goal. Five minutes later, Qinfang knocked on the door and Corinthians became a corner kick, which was still mainly opened by Qinfang. Sheriff Neto panicked to save the ball and fouled by hitting someone. He was fined a penalty kick. Ah Dai took the knife and hit it in one fell swoop (three to zero). In the 30th minute, the Portuguese team poured out their troops to attack. Luo Chailiao lost the ball in front. Mai Qidu threaded the needle. At that time, Gaien had exchanged positions with Fafan Xiao, got rid of the shackles, and shot fiercely into the net. The Portuguese team pulled back a goal (three to one). Four minutes before the end of the first half, China United became active again. Qixiang got the ball from the back, single-handedly, rushed into the forbidden area, and lightly lifted it, directly into the corner of the net. In the first half, China United led 4 to 1.

Second half

The second battle started, Qixiang left the arena due to a foot injury, and Kun Tian took over as the left wing. Qinfang returned to the original position of right forward, and Bikai went out of office, and the goalkeeper was filled by Banglun. The Portuguese team's lineup was also greatly adjusted. The two sides had offensive and competed fiercely. Wonderful scenes were presented before our eyes from time to time. For half an hour of the battle, there was nothing to gain. By the 35th minute, Portuguese player Gaien passed the ball to Fafan Xiao, and Fa took the opportunity to build his merits without anyone blocking him (inside to two). In less than three minutes, Youliang got the supply from Kun Tian and shot it in a lying position (five to two). In the last minute, Xiao Fei shot a shot from the bottom corner and returned with success. Time was up, and China United defeated Portugal by six to two.

### Tianjin Gang Efforts to Advance Gold Prices to New Heights

Yesterday, the spot price of bullion in the black market rose sharply. The price has flown out of the 20,000 yuan mark, and a new high price of 21,000 yuan for new banknotes has appeared. Converted into old French currency, it is 42,000 yuan, which is more than 2,000 yuan higher than the previous record of 40,000 yuan on May 25. It is indeed a collection of general holders. The Tianjin gang made efforts to advance more than 700 taels, and the price is still advancing to the peak. The people's minds are firm. Since the opening of each bar (ten taels) in the morning, it has risen to 19,100 yuan in the buying momentum, which is 500 yuan higher. The lowest price of 19,000 yuan was seen, and the cash number and a certain gang poured in, and the retail appetite was also good. The securities number was different in and out, and the price rose by 1,000 yuan, and it was coaxed to 20,000 yuan, which was suppressed by the Tianjin gang and the limit price buyers to a minimum of 19,800 yuan. After 10:30, the father's place finally soared in the buying atmosphere. Cash number, silver number, securities dealer and a certain gang had very good appetite, and even soared another 1,200 yuan, soaring to a record high of 21,000 yuan. The Tianjin gang and a certain gold number made efforts to sell, and the afternoon return was as small as 20,400 yuan.

### Debt Market Anomaly: A Mix of Gains and Losses

Yesterday, the market situation for public debt instruments was peculiar. Due to the previous day's limit-down prices for Class A and B bonds, buyers were particularly enthusiastic about these two classes. At the opening, Class A, B, C, and D bonds saw significant price increases, with Class E bonds also reaching a market price of 9.70 yuan. Class A bonds surged to 34.30 yuan, reaching the limit-up price. However, as sellers emerged, prices retreated, fluctuating around 34 yuan. Ultimately, due to heavy selling pressure, market prices trended downwards. Other bond classes were also affected, leading to an abnormal market situation with extremely active trading.

Both buyers and sellers remained largely within their previous ranges, though there were many new buyers. Xin Ji, for example, bought aggressively and consistently, showing strong capacity. Chang Ji also made purchases yesterday. In short, while selling was very active, buying was also substantial. The situation itself is straightforward, but future developments are difficult to predict.

Yesterday's results showed a mix of gains and losses. Class A and E bonds rose by 0.20 to 0.60 yuan, while others rose by 0.05 to 2.30 yuan. Total transaction volume was approximately 5 million yuan.

### Cotton Yarn Prices Rise, but Trading is Weak

Since the change to trading in paper legal tender on June 1st, cotton yarn prices have gradually increased. However, trading activity has not been strong, due to weak purchasing power. 42-count Blue Phoenix yarn was priced at 10,300 to 10,500 yuan, with a closing price of 10,200 yuan. 40-count Golden City yarn was at 8,500 yuan. 42-count Immortal Peach yarn was at 9,400 yuan. 32-count Immortal Peach yarn was at 9,200 yuan. 23-count Double Globe yarn was at 5,600 yuan. 20-count Double Horse yarn was at 5,750 to 5,800 yuan. 20-count Blue Phoenix yarn was at 5,800 yuan. 20-count Da Mai yarn was at 5,500 yuan. 20-count Fairy Maiden yarn was at 5,540 yuan. 20-count Yue Qin yarn was at 5,600 yuan. 20-count Sunlight yarn was at 5,450 yuan. 20-count Golden City yarn was at 5,300 yuan. 10-count Jia He yarn was at 4,050 yuan. 10-count Double Globe yarn was at 4,400 yuan. 10-count Bao Yi yarn was at 4,350 yuan. 10-count Weaver Girl yarn was at 4,400 yuan.

Along the way, some traders took profits, bringing the price back down to 5,450 yuan, but the closing price was 5,620 yuan.

### After the Suspension of East Cloth Trading, Prices Rose and Then Fell

Factory cloth prices rose sharply yesterday due to the increase in yarn prices. However, after the suspension of trading in the East Market, market sentiment softened slightly, leading to a minor price correction. 16-pound Earth Coarse Cloth was at 200 yuan, Flying Goose at 205 yuan, 9-pound New Character at 118 yuan, and 8-pound Zhen Zhong at 113 yuan, all with transactions. 12-pound Earth Fine Cloth reached a high of 206 yuan in early trading, but later fell to 192 yuan, Da Peng at 190 yuan, Fu Gui at 180 yuan, Factory Singles at 172 yuan, Peach Blossom Lady's Forest reached a high of 205 yuan, a low of 287 yuan, and closed at 291 yuan, continuing to rise by 20 yuan from the previous day.

Goods were in short supply. Due to the increasing heat, the East Cloth Market suspended afternoon trading yesterday, so only half-day trading was conducted. Prices rose and then fell, with a slightly uncertain situation. New orders for 12-pound Dragon Head Fine Cloth opened at 240 yuan, rose to 244 yuan, saw a sudden surge in buying, and then fell to 120 yuan. The closing price at noon was 128 yuan, a drop of 5 yuan per bolt. Bank Singles were at 198 yuan, Colorful Balls at 204 yuan, Flying Fish at 90 yuan. Four Gentlemen Baize Red Singles reached a high of 8.95 yuan, a low of 7.90 yuan, and closed at 8.25 yuan at noon, also down 0.30 yuan.

### Grain Merchants Wait and See, Trading is Quiet

Yesterday's miscellaneous grain market only had half-day trading in the morning because the miscellaneous grain group held a meeting of sellers in the afternoon. Both buyers and sellers held a wait-and-see attitude due to the upcoming currency changes. The overall market only saw 50 bags of Changzhou Cowhide Yellow opened at 315 yuan in old currency, 40 bags of Chongming Sand Red self-delivered at 270 yuan in old currency, and 139 yuan delivered in new currency. One carload of Wuhu Corn was priced at 100 yuan in new currency. A February new warehouse receipt for Xing Ji Bean Cake was priced at 40 yuan.

### Local Banking and Financial Firms to Handle Legal Tender Collection

Many Collection Points to be Established to Avoid Crowding - There Will Be Separate Procedures for the Sino-Farmers Bank Notes

Regarding the Sino-Farmers Bank notes and other bank notes remaining outside of the Central Bank note exchange guarantee range, because the amount in circulation on the market is quite substantial, there is no doubt about the losses to the public. This reporter made a special visit to a person in the banking industry, who said that the total amount of Sino-Farmers Bank notes circulating in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, and the two cities of Beijing and Shanghai is about 100 million yuan or more. If these cannot be exchanged for savings certificates, it would not only cause great losses to the public, but also affect the flexible use of currency chips. This is because if such a huge amount of banknotes cannot be exchanged, the currency chips will be reduced accordingly. According to his speculation, the relevant authorities will soon set other procedures for handling these banknotes to alleviate the people's hardship. As for the legal tender exchange for savings certificates procedures starting on the 8th of this month, it will inevitably be very complicated, and the crowding situation goes without saying. However, at that time, in addition to all banks and money shops acting as exchange agents, four exchange points will be established to handle exchange matters exclusively. In addition, trust companies, silver firms, and money exchange shops will also be entrusted to act as exchange agents, so there will be a very large number of exchange locations, and there should be no crowding.

### Sugar Prices Steady

Yesterday, the sugar market was initially tight and then stable. The association's official price setting saw some new transactions for spot goods. Coarse White was initially at 405 yuan in savings certificates, then retreated to 390 yuan. Dutch Red was at 350 yuan. Sugar futures were initially flat and then tight. Coarse White futures were initially at 200 yuan, then rose to 305 yuan, up 5 yuan from the previous day. Red Sand futures did not trade. The market situation was generally stable.

### Western Sand Rice Prices Rise

The supply of Western Sand Rice is scarce, and market inventory is also low, so market prices have repeatedly reached highs. The new currency price for pharmaceutical businesses has not yet been finalized, but it is expected to be realized within a few days. Yesterday's old prices were as high as 9,000 yuan, followed by 7,000 yuan to 6,000 yuan.

### Clam Market Tight

Clams have not been delivered recently, and market inventory is low, so market prices are quite firm. Yesterday, the market asked for 600 yuan, and customers offered 550 yuan, but no transaction was made.

### Cigarette Buying and Selling is Wait-and-See, Prices are Down 400-500 Yuan, Sellers Need to Receive Zhongzhongjiao Notes

The cigarette market is sometimes high and sometimes low, making it difficult for operators to make decisions. The reason is that general speculators follow financial trends, and outside hoarding households are deeply involved. Because the price increase for consumable goods is relatively low compared to other goods, the market price is still far from the military ticket linkage, and although there is patronage, it is not as smooth as before, because the season is not suitable. Fellow traders also consider the amount of inventory, because sellers need to dispose of Zhongzhongjiao notes, so some scattered households and large hoarding households are waiting and seeing, because receiving cash cannot be remitted, and most of the buyers' deposits are paid with miscellaneous notes, resulting in a stalemate in trading between the two parties, and transactions are rare. The selling price of each brand has fallen by about 400-500 yuan compared to the previous day.

### Sophora Japonica Rises 20 Yuan

Because the price of Sophora japonica is low, although sales are sparse, the market is constantly absorbing inventory, so prices are tight and not loose. Yesterday, dozens of bags of green good quality goods were opened, up 20 yuan from the previous day. Dozens of bags of ordinary goods arrived, but have not yet been opened.

Entertainment World

### Mourning John Barrymore

â New Film

Some time ago, we learned from Hollywood news that John Barrymore was seriously ill. This magazine had previously introduced this old star, and fans originally hoped that his lung disease would improve so that we could see him again on the screen. Who knew that when we opened the Sunday newspaper, we saw the news of John Barrymore's death. The bad news came, and it really made people feel very sad!

John Barrymore was born on February 15, 1882, and was exactly 60 years old this year. If we describe his history, he appeared on the screen when he was in his twenties, and it has been more than 30 years since then. We see that Hollywood's film history is only more than 50 years, and he has been a star for more than 30 years, accounting for more than half of the film history years. It is indeed a rare member.

John Barrymore was good at performing comedies, and especially the detective films he starred in were once sensational and praised by fans. Hollywood's movie stars are constantly being replaced. Usually, a star can be in the limelight for ten years, which is considered very sufficient, but he has enjoyed more than 30 years of fame from his prime to his old age. It is indeed not accidental, and it is created by his special talent. Although 60 years old cannot be considered short-lived, we see that it is not very easy to produce such an artist, so the news of his death, when it reaches our ears, always feels like we have lost something, and we express our deep condolences to him!

### Li Weining Regular Concert

â Monk

The third will be held at the Lyceum Theatre

The purpose of Li's regular concert is to promote the most noble music in the youth circles of our country. The concert has been held twice and has been supported by the general audience, especially the second violin solo concert was the most popular. In response to the public's request, Mr. Li has replayed it once. It is learned that Mr. Li believes that the Youth Association auditorium is too small and the audience is too crowded, so he has changed the third concert to be held at the Lyceum Theatre. This is the last concert of this season, and the selection of programs is even richer and more exciting. Mr. Li will play a very important role in this program, such as Haydn's steel zero trio and Mozart's quintet. Such noble and profound music originated in Vienna and is quite difficult to hear in Shanghai. In addition to Adler (violin) and Krans (cello), Xu Weilin, who won the first prize at the National Conservatory of Music in Beijing, will also participate in playing the viola. It is said that Mr. Su Shilin suddenly suffered from inflammation of the throat and the entire face, and the doctor said that it would be difficult to fully recover in a short period of time. It is now heard that Mr. Li has re-hired Mr. Si Yigui, a bass singer who recently held a solo concert at the Youth Association, to sing Su Man, Handel, and Li Weining's "Remembering the Dead Mother Before the City Gate" and other songs. Music lovers should not miss this good opportunity.

### About Miguelito

â Tao Shun Sheng

Miguelito is a child star who often meets us on the screen. He is best at playing naughty and mischievous children. In the films he starred in before, we can see his naughty energy. It can be said that he has been acting since he was a child. His natural acting has won a lot of praise from the audience. Many fans write letters to him every day. The saying that "movie stars are the food and clothing parents of the post office" can be believed even more because of him.

He is quite satisfied with his life. He said:

"I have a very wonderful profession, I also have a very beautiful car, and a glamorous girlfriend. As for education, I also have the same education as other children. You may doubt where I can get education from? But if you join the film industry, you can understand that I am not wrong. You can get a lot of new knowledge in the movie. In particular, you can understand a lot about human relationships and sophistication. I never used to pay attention to Kipling's articles, but since I acted in "Captains Courageous," I have never let go of Kipling's masterpieces. At the same time, I also learned a lot of sociology, because in "The Little Orphan Annie," I understand that there are many sad orphans in the world. All of this can be said to be the education I have received."

Miguelito's only regret in his life is that he was born too short. However, in reality, although he is short, he has a very enthusiastic attitude and treats everything with enthusiasm. Miguelito has also successfully become a star specializing in family story films with his stubborn talent. The films about Judge Hardy's family include "You're Only Young Once", "Love Finds Andy Hardy", "Andy Hardy Gets Spring Fever", and "Andy Hardy Meets Debuntante". "Judge Hardy's Children" which will be shown by Dahua recently, is also an interesting Hardy film. Miguelito plays the extremely naughty son who wants to try everything, and has received unprecedented praise from all aspects.

Miguelito is the most amazing child star at the moment, but he does not hope to act for the rest of his life. He said: "I want to go to college and study for two years, and then become a director."

### "Fragrant Concubine" Performs Again

â Huang Mei

This is a very pleasant news at the end of the period of costume plays, that is, "Fragrant Concubine" is preparing to perform again.

In mid-May, "Fragrant Concubine" was grandly performed at the Lyceum Theatre, with actors such as Huang Zongjiang, Huang Zongying, Jiang Hong, Jiang Tianliu, etc., and the results were very satisfactory. Because of the contract relationship, it was impossible to continue the performance. At that time, the person in charge of "Lafayette" had a request to perform "Fragrant Concubine" again at "Lafayette". This time, the Torrent Theatre Company is making a long-term performance at Lafayette", and the first play is to invite the former Avant-Garde Theatre Company to help perform and stage "Fragrant Concubine" at Lafayette".

"Fragrant Concubine" is a great tragic costume drama, written in a very painful way. This performance is more exciting than the last one, because many places have been completely changed again, and revised based on the last performance to make "Fragrant Concubine" more convenient to perform and create a painful tragedy. The director is still Xia Feng, and there are great changes in the cast. And the Yafeng National Music Society is in charge of the music.

The Lafayette Theater has not performed dramas for more than a month. This time, the performance of "Fragrant Concubine" is the first play to reopen, and everyone attaches great importance to it.

### Sharing the Same Boat in Storms

â He Jia Zhi

(5) Reciprocity

Wei Cheng smiled and said, "Then, I agree very much." Cui Zhen happily went inside, and Wei Cheng dealt with some other things. Sitting alone in the Shuangmei Study Room, with his arms propped on the table, his palms holding his clear chin, his two eyeballs wandered aimlessly around the room, and he saw his father's posthumous photo, which was already hanging together with his mother's posthumous photo. He felt a little sad in his heart and quickly moved outside the door. Zhang Shurong held a teapot in both hands, dragging his slippers, da da da da, walked to the door, poked his head in, and said with a smile: "Young Master Ye, you got up. I didn't give a gift, but I ate for two days, and I feel embarrassed. Everyone who came to eat said that the banquet was well organized. Today, that Young Master Chen and Miss Chen are going to Shanghai, right?" Wei Cheng said: "They are leaving today, and there is also a Miss Bian who is going to leave. If Miss Bian leaves, she will come back in a few days, and you have to send her to me." Zhang Shurong nodded and said: "Young Master Ye, I, Zhang Shurong, remember what you told me. Miss Chen is here." Zhang Shurong's face turned to look inside, and Wei Cheng quickly stood up. He saw Guofang pulling Cui Zhen's hand and jumping out, and just stepped into the entrance of the Shuangmei Study Room, and said withå¾æå¿å½¢: "I have lived here for another night, and this result is not bad. Wei Cheng, how is my tongue, I persuaded Cui Zhen, who is determined in her principles, and her father is willing to accompany me to Shanghai." Wei Cheng accompanied her with a smile: "You are a diplomatic talent. If you are sent to negotiate, the results will not be wrong. But you have to go to class, and you don't have time to accompany Sister Cui Zhen to play." Guofang said: "Go to class, pick the main courses to go to, it's only a few hours a day, what are you afraid of? Wei Cheng, I want Sister Cui Zhen to go is intentional, let her go is to make you anxious, if you are anxious, you will come to Shanghai, haha. Now Sister Cui Zhen has agreed to me, and you have also allowed her. A gentleman's word, that is, I have made it clear, and neither of you can regret it." Guofang was still holding Cui Zhen's hand, she first laughed so hard, Wei Cheng and Cui Zhen both accompanied her with laughter, and even Zhang Shurong was smiling, the mouth of his purple clay teapot was narrow, and water was flowing out continuously, he didn't know.

Note: The original sentence "Reciprocity" comes from the "Shaoyi" chapter of the Book of Rites: "Do not remove and return." Note: "Return" is read as "rush", "remove" and "rush" are both urgent. Modern people often use it as a term for frequent and repeated interactions with people. Recently, because readers have inquired about it in their letters, a special note is made as above, (Editor)

### Sketches of Pear Garden Figures

â Written by Zheng Guo Yi, Illustrated by Zhang Yizhang. Female Performer Section

(19) Yu Sulian

Yu Sulian has a charming appearance and a clever nature. Among the female performers in the South, she is considered one in ten, enough to be second only to Jin Suqin. However, her voice is thin and narrow, and she has not gotten rid of the taste of children's play. She is not as broad and sweet as Jin Suqin. Her demeanor on stage is not as dignified as Jin Suqin, and her skills are inferior to Suqin. Therefore, Jin Suqin can establish her own banner in Jiangnan today, and Yu is separated from her in this respect. However, Yu Sulian is also considered to have ambitions. At first, she only made a show of her charm in the main drama, playing unimportant roles. Later, she worked hard and suddenly jumped from the third-rate to the second-rate, and then from the second-rate to the head-rate. everything went smoothly and she had a good opportunity. However, her status rose sharply to the second rate, and she will not be able to realize her dream of being the head performer. (Yu Sulian once selected classes to perform outside, but this is a small situation and cannot be counted.) I think she is indeed a good acting material, and she is also very perceptive. I hope she will be down-to-earth and build a solid foundation first. At that time, she will not seek to be better than others, but people will naturally avoid her. If she relies solely on her little cleverness, then the matter of luck may not be tried and tested repeatedly.

### Amateur Ballad Singer's Recorder

â Chi Lan

Amateur ballad singers have long been famous on the radio and are well-known. Such as the Qin brothers, with veteran qualifications. The "Shen Xue" school of amateur singers has been well-known. On the 24th of last month, they appeared again at the Zhangwei bookstore. There were three gears in total: the head gear was Chen Jia Chi's literary and martial Xiang Qiu. Mr. Chen has a good natural voice, which is clear, crisp and pleasant to the ear. After taking the stage, he sang "Li Hentian" to open the chapter. The singing style is as veteran as Zhou Yuquan's, and also has Jiang Yuequan's intonation. The book opens with a section of Zhang Guiying's engagement in literary and martial Xiang Qiu. It is said to be clear and well-organized, and the lyrics are pleasant to listen to. Moreover, her attitude is dignified and her demeanor is generous, which is commendable. The second gear is Gao Suzai's Three Smiles, a section of Zhou Wenbin's going to the hall. He learned from Jiang Rutin's Yu tone, and the singing is delicate and extraordinary. Jiang Rutin's apprentice is afraid that he will be willing to bow down. The last gear is the famous ticket Qin brothers telling the Pearl Pagoda. Mr. Xixiang sits on the left, with a Shen Jian An style on his face. Mr. Lixiang sits on the right, although he is not as fat and black as Xue Xiaoqing, the posture of holding the pipa is also extraordinary. Mr. Xixiang first sang "Dao Hui" to open the chapter. Jian An's demeanor is no different. The Pearl Pagoda sang a section of Fang Qing and Caiping meeting in Luqiu Pavilion. Mr. Xixiang started Fang Qing's questioning of Caiping's family background, and the description was clear. Mr. Xixiang sang the lyrics repeatedly, all in one go, just like Xue Xiaoqing. The combination of pearls and jade, green leaves and peony, is a grand event. It is a pity that the Yuhua is only a flash in the pan, and the good times do not last long. This kind of storytelling meeting is not easy to come by. If it can show its head from time to time, the Shanghai book fans will rush to it like a maggot! (Qu Chout)

### Richard III

â Performance

The ADC (Eddie West) Theater Company's last performance of many small programs with songs, dances, or plays, because they cater to the psychology and interests of the Chinese people, the audience was very excited and hoped to see a large-scale multi-act song and dance drama. Based on this, the theater company carefully rehearsed and contributed Shakespeare's famous play "Richard III" from June 2nd to 6th for five days at the Lyceum Theatre. The gorgeous costumes and the large number of characters not only set an unprecedented record for the theater company, but also a rare harvest on the stage. What's more, it is Shakespeare's script. It is said that after "Richard III", the classical dance drama troupe led by the Russian Father Sharomov (that is, the one who previously performed "Ancient Temple Surprise Dream") will also hold a summer grand performance, which is really good news for theater fans!
