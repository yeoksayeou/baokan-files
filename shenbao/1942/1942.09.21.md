### Nanjing City Field Tax to be Doubled for One Year

Nanjing, 20th (Central News Agency dispatch)

Due to the soaring prices after the incident, the Nanjing Municipal Government found municipal finances greatly strained.  However, the original field tax revenue was levied according to the tax rate set before the incident.  To balance income and expenditure and adapt to the changing environment, the city government planned to request that the Nanjing field tax be doubled to supplement municipal finances.  The request was submitted to the Executive Yuan, which ordered the Ministry of Finance to review and respond.  It is reported that the Ministry of Finance considered the city's field tax still based on pre-incident levels, which differed significantly from current prices.  Doubling the field tax was deemed necessary.  However, for the sake of caution, it was decided to implement a one-year trial period.  The Ministry of Finance will separately formulate field tax rates to standardize them. The Ministry of Finance has submitted its reply to the Executive Yuan and instructed the municipal government to take note.  It is also learned that the Guangdong Provincial Government, due to the significant disparity between the field tax amount and current prices, has submitted a request to the Executive Yuan to double the levy.  It is reported that the Executive Yuan has approved the request, adopting Nanjing's approach for a one-year trial period to provide relief.

### Fighting in Stalingrad Becomes More Intense, Soviets Deploy Fresh Troops for Major Counteroffensive, Fierce Fighting Continues in Voronezh

Stockholm, 20th (Havas Agency dispatch)

The battle for Stalingrad intensifies. After deploying a large number of fresh troops, the Red Army has launched a major counteroffensive. The Red Army's general headquarters is absolutely determined to relieve the pressure on the city, as evidenced by this. However, according to German sources, German forces in the area between the Don and Volga rivers have been attacked by enemy tank units, with several gaps created at certain locations, which were quickly filled. The Red Army's objective is to establish contact with the defending forces in the city. The Red Army may launch another offensive. Street fighting within the city continues fiercely. German advances are difficult. The German Air Force continues to bomb the city, leaving bombed areas scorched. Although the Red Army has suffered heavy losses, its resistance has not weakened. To prolong the war, the Red Army seems willing to make any sacrifice, and it is rumored that Stalingrad has been cut in two for five days, but this has not been officially confirmed by Germany. In the Voronezh area, the Red Army is concentrating its efforts on launching an offensive and has occupied two villages north and south of the city. In Maliyov city on the west bank of the Don, street fighting also broke out yesterday. Under the cover of tanks, the German forces counterattacked no fewer than eight times. In addition, in the Mostdok area, General Kleist, commander of the German tank unit, has been killed in action. The German 111th and 310th divisions have suffered heavy losses.

German Headquarters, 20th (Haitong Agency dispatch)

This afternoon, the German war bulletin stated that fighting within the Stalingrad area is fierce. Soviet reinforcements moving south from the north have failed to achieve their objectives. The enemy forces in Voronezh have suffered heavy losses, and their suicidal charges have been repelled.

Moscow, 19th (Havas Agency dispatch)

The Red Army General Headquarters issued a war bulletin stating that our troops continued to fight in the Leningrad and Mostdok areas tonight. There were no major changes in other war zones.

Berlin, 20th (Haitong Agency dispatch)

After bitter fighting, German forces in Stalingrad have entered the port area, which is a Soviet stronghold. At that time, German combat engineers used flamethrowers. The oil refinery in the area has been destroyed by German aircraft and artillery. Simultaneously, German infantry, combat engineers, armored units, grenadiers, and direct-fire artillery units continue to advance. Soviet forces are still attempting to reinforce the defending Soviet troops, sheltering in destroyed residences and factories to suddenly attack German forces. Soviet troops are attacking from the north in an attempt to relieve the siege of Stalingrad, with the Volga River serving as part of the Soviet defensive line. Seventy-seven Soviet aircraft were shot down over Stalingrad the day before yesterday, demonstrating the intensity of the aerial combat. On the evening of the 17th, Soviet forces attempted to land on the Motovsky Bay on the Soviet northern island but were repelled by German forces. Soviet attempts to land in the Lizza Bay were also repelled by artillery fire.

Soviet border area, 19th (Havas Agency dispatch)

According to German military experts here, two-thirds of the Stalingrad area is in German hands, so the battle for the city has now entered the mopping-up phase. However, the Red Army still holds important positions inside and outside the city, especially in the west and northwest of the city. The German troops that have entered the city have cut the Red Army into several sections. German forces are gradually advancing through the groups of fortresses converted from civilian houses. The fighting is more intense than before. Yesterday, however, it was claimed that the Red Army had recovered three large factories, and in recent days, heavy rains have fallen on the front lines, making the roads muddy and slowing the German advance. However, this type of weather is also unfavorable to the Red Army. The artillery units on the left bank of the Volga River are also less active than in the past. On the German side, however, there are constant attempts to cross the Volga River by force to neutralize the Soviet artillery and cut off the Red Army's only escape route. But to date, none of the German attempts have been successful. In short, the battle for the city appears to be nearing its end. Both sides are fighting resolutely, ignoring the difficulties caused by the prolonged warfare. But in any case, both sides are exhausted and cannot last. In addition, the Stalingrad area is very cold, especially at night, and the cold air is detrimental to the fighting.

### YMCA Initiates Subsidy for Impoverished Students' Meals

I saw several thank-you letters from poor students in the office of the Student Relief Committee of the YMCA, and I felt very touched and a little sad.

These students are all high school students or above who have previously sought assistance from the relief committee. The contents of these letters are all very similar. First, they express their sincere gratitude for the committee's past relief and assistance. Then, they say, "But I can no longer enjoy the benefits of your society because black spots have been found in my lungs. The doctor diagnosed me with lung disease and I must stop studying and recuperate." Finally, they express their deep admiration for the work of the society.

What is most surprising is that these poor students all suffer from lung disease and cannot continue their studies because of lung disease.

I remember that last year, a university in this city conducted a physical examination and discovered a shocking fact: 70% of the students in the school suffered from tuberculosis.

A university student personally told me that his tuition fee for this semester costs 240 yuan, but his meals cost 300 yuan per month. With four months in a semester, meal expenses amount to 1,200 yuan.

The above facts reveal the following points: ㈠ Meal expenses are several times more expensive than tuition fees. ㈡ Many students suffer from tuberculosis, which means that most students are undernourished. ㈢ Poor students have even more nutritional problems due to the high cost of meals. ㈣ Tuition fees are subsidized, but meal expenses are not.

In view of this, the Student Relief Committee specially initiated a student meal subsidy program last year. The student cafeteria organized by the YMCA helps a portion of impoverished students solve their meal problems. The objectives are as follows: ㈠ Subsidize a portion of the meal expenses for truly impoverished students. ㈡ Pay special attention to the nutrition of students' meals. ㈢ Emphasize cleanliness and cultivate automatic habits.

The above points have already achieved satisfactory results.

This year, prices are even higher. In order to continue past efforts and make up for this growing shortfall, the Student Relief Committee has launched a student meal subsidy fundraising campaign with a target of 50,000 yuan for this semester, hoping to help 300 impoverished students.

The qualifications for students to receive the society's meal subsidy are as follows: ㈠ Students above the middle school level who are truly children from impoverished families. ㈡ Students with good character and academic performance who have been certified by the school authorities.

Any impoverished students who intend to request a meal subsidy can register with the Student Relief Committee of the YMCA from September 17th to 24th. The registration locations are the YMCA at 8 Xianqiao on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays from 2:00 PM to 5:00 PM and the YWCA at 638 Weihaiwei Road on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays from 2:00 PM to 5:00 PM.

There is no shortage of enthusiastic people in society who care for young people. It is hoped that they will enthusiastically respond to this campaign to subsidize the meals of impoverished students and help students in their studies. Collection locations: ㈠ YMCA at 8 Xianqiao ㈡ YWCA at 638 Weihaiwei Road

### Shen Bao Reader's Scholarship Donation Report

### Football Season Opens: Tunghwa Draws with St. Francis

Two to Two, One Goal Each in the First Half

The first sound of autumn football: Tunghwa and St. Francis kicked off the football season at the racecourse yesterday at 5 PM. The match was tense and the performance was excellent. Each team scored one goal in the first half and one goal in the second half, resulting in a 2-2 draw.

Tunghwa Performance

Dai Linjing, Jia Youliang, and Han Longhai were the best players yesterday. Zhang Banglun, Zhuang Youren, and Zhang Zhaopeng were also good. Yuan Kun and Tian Shouren were closely guarded and could not fully demonstrate their skills. Gem Wahda of St. Francis was the most outstanding player, scoring both goals. The second goal, a solo effort, broke through two defenses and was a brilliant performance. Fuen was still an experienced veteran. The audience reached over 5,000 people.

Two Army Contact

Tunghwa's attack was unsuccessful. After seven minutes, Dai Linjing got the ball and shot hard. The St. Francis goalkeeper was careless and missed, but the ball hit the crossbar. St. Francis turned misfortune into blessing. Griffith passed to Gem Wahda who was unable to exert influence within ten-yard shooting position, however, Gem Wahda's shot hit the mark. In less than two minutes, Han Longhai tried a shot from thirty yards and miraculously scored, making it 1-1. Twenty minutes later, St. Francis' Greenburg committed a foul and a penalty was awarded. Ah Dai shot the ball, which hit a body and bounced out of bounds. The battle was fierce and each team had excellent opportunities, but both were unable to take advantage of them. In the dark, after eighteen minutes, Gem Wahda attacked alone as if entering an uninhabited area, and Zhang Banglun could not save it. At fifty minutes, Tunghwa's Dai Linjing, with the help of Zhang Mingsheng, scored from fifteen yards to tie the game. Time expired, Tunghwa 2, St. Francis 2.

Economic Special Issue, No. 432

Market Trends

Government Bonds Surge

The most significant feature of the bond market last week was breaking the old concept of 20% of face value, with all bonds jumping above the 50 yuan mark. Unified Class A and B bonds both rose above 56 yuan, Class C bonds reached 55 yuan, and Class D and E bonds both reached 53 yuan. From a psychological perspective within the bond market, this is quite interesting. However, in terms of the purchasing power of money, bondholders are still at a disadvantage compared to holders of goods or general stocks. Regardless of their motivation, bondholders are cooperators in the nation's finances. If the country does not perish, the government will always need to issue bonds. How can it be in the government's interest to sacrifice the interests of bondholders? Given this principle, the future direction of both markets can be imagined.

The newly established so-called Public Bond Fund Management Committee is said to be chaired by Hou Yuan, with members including Wang Huailian and ten others. Although the management focus may temporarily be limited to the 1.5 billion yuan of Stability Finance Public Bonds issued in Nanjing, before the true situation is clear, the rumors circulating in the market about redemption and reorganization are worth noting.

Regarding the organizational issues of the public bond market, the formal handover procedures between the old and new trade associations were completed last Wednesday, marking the end of a phase. The original Securities Association has transferred all its business to the Securities Trade Association, which is currently being established. The new association is expected to open within days, inheriting the original business and also handling Chinese stock trading.

### Settlement of Foreign Stocks

The average prices have been calculated as follows (unit: legal currency yuan):

Asia Navigation: 17.66 English Wool: 10.11

### Stagnant Chinese Stocks

Compared to the soaring government bonds last week, the Chinese stock market was indeed lackluster, even more stagnant than the previous week. Was this a period of consolidation after a sharp rise, or was it due to the tightening of finances during the Mid-Autumn Festival? Various factors are at play.

The overall trend for the week was initially weak, then firm, and finally softened again, showing how volatile the market sentiment was. This is also a common phenomenon after market prices have risen too much. The main external pressure currently centers on the regulations. It is said that the situation has improved slightly after multiple negotiations, but because the negotiations have been going on for a long time, they have lost their stimulating effect on the market.

Among financial and industrial stocks, some showed relatively strong performance last week. Textile and pharmaceutical stocks also saw a gradual stabilization. Department store stocks, which overreacted in the previous week, were in a state of natural adjustment last week and lacked luster. This controlled rise and fall may continue for some time.

### Yarn, Cloth, Wool

The market for yarn, cloth, and wool continues to be strong, especially towards the weekend. Phoenix brand reached 5,150 yuan, Horse brand reached over 5,700 yuan, and Dragon Head brand reached 177 yuan. Only the Four Gentlemen remained weak and sluggish. Most other factory cloths also improved, and wool even gained an advantage. This situation has continued for a considerable period. Could there be something else brewing in the future?

The most difficult problem for the textile industry is the difficulty of obtaining raw materials. Last week, the Sino-Japanese Hua Zhong Cotton Control Association was established, with Mr. Tsutsumi of the Japanese Textile Industry Association as chairman and Mr. Tong Luqing of Shen Xin Spinning Mill as vice chairman. The board of directors has ten members, including Jiang Shangda of Minfeng, Guo Ditian of Wing On Third Factory, Li Shengbo of Cheng Yun, and Guo Jianying of Anda. The board of supervisors has four members, including Yan Qingxiang of Su Lun and Li Wenjie of Chang Tai Cotton. The association will be responsible for the purchase and distribution of cotton produced in Central China and will manage cotton prices. It is said that the principle for distributing raw cotton in the future will be based on the average allocation per spindle. According to experts, Chinese factories currently own about 35% of all spindles in the Central China region, so Chinese factories can obtain 30% of the total cotton production in Central China. It is said that the difficulties caused by not obtaining raw cotton can be reduced in the future. Therefore, the establishment of this association should provide a stable force for yarn and cloth prices. However, if the opposite is true, the relevant authorities have paid close attention.

### Off-Market Chat

The Japanese-owned China Insurance Association is currently accepting applications from Chinese and other foreign businesses to join and reorganize. It is currently being reorganized by seven companies, including the Japanese Maritime Fire Insurance Company. The Japanese Maritime Fire Insurance Company was elected as the chairman of the reorganization committee. The goal of the reorganization is to establish a strong organization to exercise comprehensive guidance over the entire insurance industry in Shanghai.

After the flow of funds concentrated on Chinese stocks, research materials on Chinese stocks emerged. Some people asked me to recommend a few books, but there were very few satisfactory ones. The "Summary of Chinese Stocks" compiled and published by Mr. Wang Xiangqin for Xingye Stock Number is arguably the best one.

The activities of the Japanese Yasuda-affiliated insurance conglomerate in Shanghai are characterized by joint ventures with Chinese businesses. For example, the Anli Maritime Insurance Company, which was previously planned, is a joint venture between the Yasuda group and a certain Chinese business. Now, the Tokyo Fire and Imperial Maritime companies of the Yasuda group have also jointly established a new company with Mr. Chen Bofan. It is said that the Mitsui-affiliated insurance company also intends to follow suit.

Autumn orchids have been listed on the market, and the purchase price set by the relevant parties is limited to 320 to 360 yuan per load. According to yesterday's news, the price of autumn orchids listed in Wuxi is calculated at 320 yuan.

### The Marketplace of Life

— Lin Bao

The bustling world is a large marketplace, and everyone in the world is a merchant.

Our genetic inheritance, environment, education, time, space, opportunities, property, and basic needs like clothing, food, housing, and transportation constitute our capital. We must use this capital to do business.

Some people are lazy and do not manage their capital, resulting in its depletion and a state of nothingness.

Those who are not good at managing their capital not only lose their own capital but also encroach upon the capital of others.

Those who are skilled at doing business make full use of their capital to operate and plan in the marketplace of life. They seize opportunities, make a lot of money, and become wealthy merchants in the marketplace of life.

However, conducting business in the marketplace of life is not about being selfish and self-serving, nor is it about benefiting oneself at the expense of others. Instead, it is about cooperation, mutual assistance, and benefiting both oneself and others.

Therefore, wealth and poverty in the marketplace of life are not measured by bank deposits, nor by the amount of real estate one owns, nor by the extravagance of one's lifestyle. Instead, they are judged by one's contributions to society and the community.

Thus, in the marketplace of life, success does not necessarily equate to wealth, and wealth does not necessarily equate to success.

The more prosperous the business, the more one returns to society, because society is our boss.

### Flowers with Butter

— Xiao Ying

I am a flower, and recently, I have become a flower covered in butter. Oh, isn't that right? Look, aren't I covered in face powder, rouge, and nail polish? These are things I don't want to do, but what can I do?

About a month ago, one morning, my mother said to me, "Ah Xue, your aunt has found you a job. It took him a lot of effort to plead for you. You must understand the difficulty of finding a job and the hardship of life. You must be patient." As if it were a very important matter, she quietly said to me, "You are already twenty years old. A twenty-year-old girl is like a flower. Be careful of those frivolous bees and butterflies outside."

So, the day my uncle led me into the company to meet the personnel director, I deliberately took off my beloved light red poplin cheongsam and put on a newer, plain-colored rayon dress. With a nervous heart, I carefully bowed to him as my uncle had instructed me beforehand and called out, "Mr. X." He nodded, glanced at me, and said, "Not bad," but then frowned and told my uncle, "Dressing like this is like a student in school. This isn't the style here. You must... you must..." He pondered for a moment and said, "You must put on some butter first." Then he told my uncle to come back in a week to prepare. "Now, you might as well take your niece around to see how people put on butter."

Holding onto my frustrated emotions, I looked at the samples and became furious. I blurted out to my uncle that I wouldn't and didn't like putting on butter and would rather not do it. But then, I quickly retracted my suggestion and said, "Let me try it," because I remembered my mother's words about the hardship of life.

So, I ran to the company to secretly and diligently learn how to apply face powder, rouge, and nail polish, how to style my hair, how to wear tight-fitting cheongsams, and how to go barefoot. Only then was I qualified to join the company's female staff.

Once, a customer stared at me outside the counter for a full five minutes without showing any sign of leaving. My heart pounded in my chest. I pretended to be arranging the goods in the wall cabinet and turned my back, swaying from side to side. But he seemed unable to see clearly and angrily muttered to himself, "You dress up so seductively and still put on airs like you're something special. A vase." I almost wanted to cry, but I gritted my teeth and endured it.

Did I want to be a vase? Did I want to put on butter? Today's society doesn't allow us women to rely solely on labor to earn a living. If we want to eat, we have to be vases, put on butter, and act coquettishly.

Who can understand this predicament? When will we women truly be able to stand on our own feet in society by relying solely on our labor?

### A Glimpse into the Money Shop Industry

— Yi Wei

㈠ Old Seniors of the Financial World

New York in America has Wall Street, which is where banking giants concentrate, secretly holding the financial hub of the entire US and even the world. If you don't mind me making an inappropriate comparison, Shanghai also has its Wall Street, which is the eastern part of Ningbo Road in the Public Concession, from Sichuan Road in the east to Shanxi Road in the west, including Tianjin Road and Beijing Road to the north and south. Within this relatively small area, money shops, banks, money exchange shops, and similar financial institutions like trust companies and insurance companies are concentrated like beehives, door to door. Because the storefronts are limited, even the alleys are penetrated by several money shops. Don't underestimate them; the entire city of Shanghai isn't it the financial hub of all of China and isn't it grasped by the giants here? But one thing is not quite the same as abroad, that is, the new financial organizations, banks, at most can only grasp a small part of the power here, and a large part is still in the hands of its old seniors in the money shop industry.

Saying old seniors is not bragging for the money shop industry, every book studying the financial history of China will tell you that before the earliest bank, the China General Chamber of Commerce was established, money shops had already established a very solid foundation in Shanghai and major cities. Its history is at least two hundred years or more. Its predecessor was transformed from a bill shop specializing in remittance business, but the development in the last hundred years is closely related to the economic aggression of imperialists such as Britain and America, because after foreign capital invaded China, it was unfamiliar with the people and land and needed to use the relationship between money shops and the business community to carry out transactions, so it supported money shops, such as the addition of compradors, the provision of credit loans to foreign banks, and even the remittance system unique to money shops only dealt with foreign banks and resolved payments, while the emerging Chinese banks were still excluded. This was the golden age of the money shop industry, but good times don't last forever, and consecutive blows from the credit crisis, the abolition of taels and the adoption of yuan, and the financial contraction after the 23rd year of the Republic of China, coupled with its own corruption, whether in management or operation, were not as advanced as banks. The leading position of the old seniors gradually had to be replaced by the formidable younger generation. After the outbreak of the 813 War, Shanghai became an isolated island, and the abnormal speculative boom gave it a strong shot in the arm, because during the war, the losses of money shops were not as great as those of banks, and its rampant lending and high interest rates were beyond the reach of banks, so in the last three years, it has flourished again and the profits have doubled until recently, because the authorities controlled prices and cracked down on speculation, and the business of money shops seems to have returned from splendor to blandness, but the newly opened and prepared ones are still coming and going, is it really to help industry and commerce and revive the market or to continue the old tune and collude with speculative merchants? Let's wait and see what happens next.

### Sailing in the Same Stormy Boat

— He Jia Zhi

(9) Human Hell

Wei Yunqing put down the abacus, rushed over and grabbed Madam Wei by the collar, "So, you old woman, you're interfering with my affairs! So you knew Miss Bian was there!" Wei Yunqing grabbed her collar for a while, probing and wanting his wife to tell him. Madam Wei usually couldn't stand up to Wei Yunqing in the Wei residence, but she was considered to be just below one person. Now that she was in front of her son and daughter-in-law and in front of the family, she stood firm and said, "You want to hit me? You want to hit me? I knew, how come you didn't ask me? If you didn't ask me, why should I tell you?" Wei Yunqing immediately let go and said, "You know, that's good. You say where is she?" Madam Wei said, "Good, so you know, Miss Bian and Shaoyun are together. This isn't Miss Bian being missing, nor Miss Bian being robbed, but an idea that Shaoyun came up with. He took her away so that you, the master, would give up on this idea."

Wei Yunqing heard his wife's words, gathered all the saliva in his mouth, puffed up both sides of his ribs, and then suddenly spat on Madam Wei's face, "Bah! Bah! Bah! You're dreaming, and you haven't woken up yet! You've been here for decades, don't you know my temper yet? If I want to do something, I'll stop when I've done it. If I can't do it, I won't stop! I don't have that kind of heart. How did I earn so much real estate? How did I earn so much farmland? Where did I get the money to feed so many mouths and have people wait on you? Old woman, listen up, taking a concubine is something that old people like us do. What concubine should young people take? I've worked hard for decades, and if I take a concubine, it's not even considered enjoyment. I want to take ten! What can you do?" Wei Yunqing's temper flared at Madam Wei. Madam Wei, in her capacity as a madam, dared to retort a few words, saying, "If you have the ability, go and take them. I can't control it. We'll all go out to watch Master Wei take a concubine. We'll open our mouths and eat wedding sweets!" Madam Wei wanted to walk out, but Wei Yunqing reached out and grabbed her, saying, "Where are you going? Your words clearly reveal that Miss Bian is somewhere. Where is that rebellious son Shaoyun? Tell me! Tell me now! If you don't tell me, I won't let you off. I'll go find them myself!" Madam Wei said, "I don't know." (182)
