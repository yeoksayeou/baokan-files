### Disagreement Between US and Soviet Union on Reconstruction of Europe: Soviet Union Establishes Diplomatic Relations with South Africa; Swinton Appointed British Ambassador to West Africa

Bern, Switzerland, 8th, Domei News Agency Telegram: Recently, the Soviet Ambassador to Britain, Litvinov, and the US Secretary of State, Hull, held several meetings to exchange views on the reconstruction of Europe. However, due to the vast differences in the fundamental policies between the two countries, their opinions did not converge. According to news from London, the US government regards the Anglo-American Atlantic Charter as the fundamental guideline for dealing with world issues, advocating that any nation in the world has the freedom to choose its own political form. At the same time, the United Nations adopts a policy of not recognizing the invasion of other countries' territories. Therefore, the United States advocates the restoration of the three Baltic states conquered by the Soviet Union. However, the Soviet Union cannot recognize the principle of national self-determination in the Atlantic Charter. Furthermore, key officials of the United States and the Soviet Union are focusing on external propaganda to gain their own advantageous positions. Soviet Ambassador Litvinov recently told a group of reporters that he had submitted a certain note to US Secretary of State Hull on May 26, implying that the note included the Soviet demands for military deployment in Europe. The US side then reportedly handed the Lend-Lease military supplies agreement to Litvinov, forcing the Soviet side to recognize the Atlantic Charter. The opposition between the US and Soviet Union has become apparent. The US authorities are deeply concerned about the development of the situation, so they are vigorously publicizing the close cooperation between the two countries to dispel doubts. For example, the Washington telegram of the Daily Mail reported that the US and the Soviet Union have not only launched a joint diplomatic offensive but also strengthened military cooperation. The US declaration of war on Hungary, Romania, and Bulgaria was made at the request of the Soviet side.

Lisbon, 9th, Domei News Agency Telegram: After the Soviet Union established diplomatic relations with South Africa, Soviet consulate staff arrived in Pretoria yesterday. Soviet Consul General Dimyanov is also expected to arrive within this week.

### British Newspapers Discuss Post-War Economy

Dublin, the capital of Southern Ireland, 8th, Havas News Agency Telegram: Recent war news has been scarce and extremely monotonous. British newspapers find it difficult to elaborate on this aspect in editorials and articles, so they discuss post-war economy, world political issues, and the general new economic system in great detail. It is generally believed that the truth after the end of this war is unknown, but the prospects are expected to be extremely bleak, even worse than after the last war. It is not easy to restore the peaceful atmosphere of Britain in the past. The war has destroyed all the foundations of Britain's survival. Britain can no longer import food from overseas to make up for the inadequacy of its mainland. In addition, after the demobilization of the entire country, a large number of unemployed men and women will compete to find work in the labor market, and it will be difficult to accommodate the factories that specialize in wartime production. Thousands of houses across the country will be destroyed. The funds invested by Britain in Liaodong and other places will also be lost or partially lost. At that time, only the implementation of strong economic policies can remedy the situation and prevent the revival of the old free financial system at all costs. Production and consumers should be controlled by the central authorities, at least until the completion of the restoration period. On the whole, the funds and resources lost by Britain are only a drop in the bucket compared with the entire property. Britain will eventually benefit from the experience gained in the war. In short, the important economic measures after the war are nothing more than the following: 1. Strictly control all luxury goods to prevent secondary industries from hindering the development of major industries and destroying the future economic system. 2. Increase the discount rate to prevent inflation. 3. Solve unemployment problems and labor disputes. 4. Restore international trade. 5. Prevent capital flight. 6. Reduce general living standards.

### Britain and the United States Adjust Wartime Production Plans, Seeking to Reduce Maritime Transportation; Joint Committee Established

Lisbon, 8th, Domei News Agency Telegram: Britain and the United States are now seeking to adjust and unify their production plans as a way to break the current deadlock. According to a Reuters report from Washington, Britain and the United States have reached an agreement on the establishment of a committee to coordinate the production matters of the two countries. It is generally believed that this is the result of the recent efforts of the British Minister of Production, Lyttelton, in the United States. It is reported that the two countries will soon announce the organization of the committee.

Washington, 9th, Havas News Agency Telegram: The White House announced a while ago that the Joint Production Committee of Britain and the United States has been established. Its task is to establish and adjust the wartime production plans of both parties. It is said that this decision aims to reduce the transportation of goods between the two countries and is also the result of the meeting held by the British Minister of War Supplies, Lyttelton, with the US authorities. After the White House issued the press release, Mr. Lyttelton then gave a speech to the press, saying, "The talks between our two countries are currently underway. We are eager to complete the production plan in order to save maritime transportation as much as possible. This is a major event during the war. Once this production plan is in place, we will not have to rely so heavily on the convenience of maritime transport."

### US Congressmen Gradually Losing Popular Support: Incompetence Predominates, Elections Scheduled for This Autumn

New York, 9th, Havas News Agency Telegram: After the government issued an order restricting gasoline consumption, congressmen requested special gasoline rationing coupons, seeking exemption from the restrictions. Public opinion initially debated whether this demand by congressmen was reasonable, but now there are complaints about the congressmen themselves. The gradual loss of popular support for congressmen is evident from this. The entire House of Representatives and one-third of the Senate are scheduled to be re-elected in the autumn. This trend in public opinion is of particular significance. However, what public opinion is dissatisfied with is not the parliamentary system itself, but the selection of congressmen. According to the opponents of the parliament, the current Senate and House of Representatives lack outstanding figures and are dominated by incompetent people. This situation can be seen in the previous session. If it were in peacetime, this situation would only cause some numbness. In these times of war, when the international situation is unpredictable, capable people are needed to propose clear legislative proposals. When the United States had not yet joined the war, the general public could still sympathize with the parliament, and most voters supported the independence of the legislative branch. However, as of now, the prestige of the parliament is declining. Former President Hoover recently made a statement advocating that President Roosevelt should exercise economic dictatorial powers during the war, which actually implies the trend of public opinion. The congressmen, who were hurt by this criticism, could not remain silent, and some even called it "treason" and accused the newspapers of being accomplices. However, this reaction only fueled the anger of public opinion. Some congressmen are also thinking of increasing the minimum wage for soldiers in the army and navy in the hope of ingratiating themselves with voters. However, the impatience of the American voters is still increasing. Some mischievous people have even sent "comfort bags" to members of the Senate and House of Representatives as a joke. The newspapers took the opportunity to promote this as a very good story. One newspaper even launched an organization called "Charitable Organization for the Prevention of Harm to Parliament" and posted slogans, advising the people of the country, and its warnings said, "The congressmen are chosen by you. Before you find good talent, please do not fire at them." However, this kind of protection of congressmen is by no means a decrease in the American people's belief in democracy, but a demand for more excellent congressmen. It is generally believed that this trend will have a major impact on the elections in the autumn.

### Italy Releases Casualty Statistics

### British Air Commodore Ambler Appointed to New Post

London, 8th, Havas News Agency Telegram: It was officially announced that Air Commodore Ambler, a squadron leader, has succeeded Norris as the commander of the Air Force Reconnaissance Corps, responsible for upper air reconnaissance in mainland Britain. There are currently many reconnaissance stations in the UK.

Bern, Switzerland, 8th, Havas News Agency Telegram: The Frankfurter Zeitung recently published a commentary criticizing the British aircraft for continuously bombing Germany, stating that the German High Command has never bothered to take advantage of the British bombing of undefended cities, so Britain has failed to achieve the effect of deterring Germany. However, this does not mean that Germany does not know how to retaliate. Once the time is ripe, Churchill will be surprised by the strength of the German Air Force. Churchill originally wanted to show his people and his allies that Britain can still be active in many ways, but bombing undefended cities at night only proves his weakness. If Britain can only bomb, then the so-called opening of the second front will be difficult to achieve. This cannot make the German people kneel down and submit.

### British Aircraft Attack Germany

Xianglin, 9th, Seito News Agency Telegram: A group of British bombers attacked several western German cities last night. Military facilities suffered no damage. Although bombs and incendiary bombs were dropped in residential areas, losses were minimal. Eight enemy aircraft were shot down.

London, 8th, Havas News Agency Telegram: An official communique stated that British aircraft flew over occupied France today and bombed between the ports of Dieppe and Dunkirk. At the same time, they bombed factories and communication lines in the Bruges area of ​​Belgium. Afterwards, we lost six Spitfire aircraft, but shot down four enemy aircraft. Last night, a group of German aircraft bombed a city on the southwest coast of Britain. One bomber was shot down by our side. The material damage in the area was very minor, and there were no deaths or injuries.

Berlin, 9th, Seito News Agency Telegram: The German High Command announced last night that German fighter planes shot down seven British aircraft over the English Channel yesterday. The aerial battle took place near Bruges and Ostend. The British aircraft turned back after losing seven aircraft. The British air raid caused only minor damage.

### German Army Determined to Concentrate Forces to Attack Soviet Black Sea Base: Fierce Fighting in the Sevastopol Area

Somewhere on the border of Ukraine, 8th, Havas News Agency Telegram: General Manstein has decided to concentrate all his forces to attack the port of Sevastopol. The German High Command believes that the Soviet defenders will be easily overcome because traffic to the outside world has been cut off. This offensive is likely the last battle before the German army launches a general offensive. As for the reasons why the German army is concentrating its attack on the port, there are no more than the following: 1. Although this fortress is not as important militarily as it used to be, it is still enough to pose a threat to Axis ships sailing in the Black Sea. 2. This port is the best base for the Soviet Navy in the Black Sea, while other ports are commercial in nature. 3. If the German army can occupy the port, the Soviet Black Sea Fleet will inevitably disperse to various ports, and if this happens, its combat power will be greatly reduced.

Berlin, 9th, Havas News Agency Telegram: The High Command issued a war report stating that the battle in the fortress area of ​​the port of Sevastopol continued yesterday. Under the cover of a large number of aircraft and heavy artillery, German infantry occupied several fortresses on high ground. Several counterattacks by the Red Army were repelled. The Red Army also made weak counterattacks northeast of Kharkov, but was forced to retreat.

Bern, Switzerland, 8th, Havas News Agency Telegram: According to reliable sources, when German leader Hitler recently personally went to Finland to congratulate General Mannerheim, the Commander-in-Chief of the Finnish Defense Forces, he took the opportunity to provide assurances, stating that four fresh German divisions, including one armored division, would be deployed to the Finnish front in the near future to assist the Finnish army in combat.

Stockholm, Sweden, 8th, Havas News Agency Telegram: Military personnel here recently said that the German army in the eastern front is actively engaged in preparations, which is a sign that the German army is about to launch a large-scale offensive. However, as of now, it is difficult to determine exactly where the German army will launch its offensive, but it is believed that the Murmansk area, the Leningrad area, the central Kalinin area, and the Sevastopol area will all be the targets of the German army's future operations. According to Soviet war reports, under the cover of the air force, the German army continues to launch fierce attacks on the port of Sevastopol, and German aircraft groups continue to bomb the port's military facilities. The Soviet air force and anti-aircraft artillery units defended bravely, which was quite successful. However, it is undeniable that the German army and air force have an advantage. The Soviet side announced that the German army's repeated attacks outside the city were repelled by the Red Army, but German reinforcements, including a large number of tank convoys and motorized units, have indeed approached the city. In short, the position of the Red Army in the port of Sevastopol is quite difficult. In addition to receiving supplies from the sea and air, it is impossible to maintain land transportation. Therefore, its situation can be compared to the former port of Kerch. Therefore, the fate of the port of Sevastopol will be known sooner or later, and Soviet spokesmen have claimed that the people in the area have been ordered to mobilize and transfer to the front to strengthen the defense. In other cases, the German air force's fierce bombing of the Soviet railway in the Murmansk area can also be regarded as a prelude to the German army's offensive. Finnish people and Germans in the country have recently emphasized the importance of the Murmansk area. Hitler's appointment of General Dietl as the commander of the Murmansk front and General Opestumv as the commander of the air force on the front are all meaningful measures. So far, however, the war in the Murmansk area has been limited to the activity of outposts on both sides. In the central part, it is still difficult to determine the exact positions of both sides. The German army is carrying out encirclement and mopping-up operations, while the Soviet side claims that a major war has broken out in the northern part of the central region. The Red Army has recaptured two villages, and Soviet tank units are fighting between Novgorod and Zhudovo. The German army began to move, and its purpose was to recover the positions lost last winter. According to German war reports, the German army has destroyed 54 Soviet tanks. In addition, the war in the Kharkov area has gradually subsided in recent days, with only local wars in the Izyum area. However, the air forces of both sides are still very active.

### Interruption of German-Swedish Telephone Communication Likely Related to Eastern Front Battlefield

Stockholm, Sweden, 8th - Havas News Agency: The long-distance telephone line between Berlin and here was interrupted again at 6:30 PM tonight. Correspondents from various newspapers in Berlin have telegraphed that the authorities plan to take the same measures tomorrow evening. Although the German authorities have not explained the reason for this, neutral parties believe it is likely related to the situation on the Eastern Front. Telephone communication between Berlin and here was also cut off once on the night of the 29th of last month.

German Border Region, 8th - Havas News Agency: The "Frankfurter Zeitung" recently stated that Germany has decided to restrict long-distance telephone communication. After 7:00 PM, the duration of ordinary long-distance phone conversations must not exceed three minutes.

### Fierce Fighting in North Africa's Scorching Sands Unprecedented

Libyan Border Region, 8th - Havas News Agency: The Libyan conflict, which recently reignited, has now entered its third week. The intensity of the fighting is increasing. The warring parties are attacking each other in this vast desert. Despite the scorching heat and frequent sandstorms, the intensity of the battle has not diminished. According to British sources, General Rommel's forces launched a major offensive against the main British force yesterday in the El Adem area and around Knightsbridge, but were repelled by the British army. Although the British forces in the El Adem area are surrounded, they are still fighting bravely. The British Air Force is also very active, bombing enemy lines of communication and supply trains. It is currently difficult to predict the future of the Libyan conflict. However, it is believed that the British army has gained a slight advantage, mainly because the British supply lines are shorter and the British troops are fighting on their original positions, making it easier to repair damaged vehicles. On the Axis side, however, damaged tanks and trucks have to be abandoned.

Stockholm, Sweden, 9th - Huitong News Agency: According to Swedish newspapers, a Tunis dispatch reports that the third round of battle in the North African desert has now begun. The intensity is unprecedented. On the twelfth day of the war, the intensity of the artillery fire and bomb explosions was so great that it even caused a light rain in the desert. This is truly the first time in human history. According to Cairo reports, there are only two possibilities for the current situation: either General Rommel will reach Egypt, or General Ritchie will directly attack Tripoli. A British correspondent in Cairo reported that he had witnessed the previous battles of Bir Hacheim and Sollum, but had never seen a North African battle as fierce as this one. Even the fiercest battles in France cannot compare to this one. Although British aircraft are making great efforts to attack, they are still unable to cut off the Rommel's supply lines. The port of Benghazi is crowded with ships. This battle is being fought in scorching heat and sandstorms, which will test the British army's resilience. According to London sources, the situation is still chaotic, and the front lines are constantly changing. It will probably take many days to determine the outcome of the battle.

### German and Hungarian Leaders Discuss General Cooperation Issues, Political Matters Take Precedence Over Military Concerns, Hungarian Prime Minister to Visit Rome

The grapes produced in Australia's 123,000 acres of vineyards are not only used to bake raisins, but also to make wine, with an annual production of about 19 million gallons, of which seven-tenths are produced in South Australia.

Rice is also produced in the Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area of ​​New South Wales. In 1924-25, the initial harvest was over 16,000 bushels, which was much better than imported rice. Therefore, the rice industry has developed rapidly. By 1937, 24,000 acres of rice paddies had produced 2,269,000 bushels of rice, which was sufficient to meet the country's average annual demand of 1.1 million bushels. Currently, there are 53,000 acres of land suitable for growing rice in the Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area, and another 22,000 acres are still under cultivation.

The wood produced in Australia has many kinds of extremely hard texture, which can be used as railway sleepers. Some have lasted for up to 50 years without being damaged. On average, they can be used for about 25 years. Mineral resources include coal, copper, gold, iron, diamonds, etc., and there are many kinds. Their value had increased to £32 million in 1937.

The development of Australian literature is not as rapid as the development of art. Soft books, romance or psychological analysis novels or poems are not very popular in Australia. The traditional spirit of British literature cannot be fully displayed in Australia, where the environment is very different from that of England, Scotland, or Ireland. Moreover, the immortal masterpieces of the great British poets Shelley, Browning, and Byron were written under the inspiration of the Mediterranean environment.

Bookstores in major Australian cities cannot be compared with the grandeur of bookstores in London, Edinburgh, Oxford, Cambridge, and other places. A member of the British House of Commons once told the country that the average number of books purchased per person in Australia is less than in other self-governing colonies. In fact, the self-governing colony with the highest average number of books purchased per person is New Zealand, followed by Australia.

As for Australian artists, they have a unique style. Both the colors and lines are different from those of European artists. Most of the paintings by Australian artists are collected by local people, so few outstanding works are transported overseas. If you want to appreciate the essence of Australian painting art, you must visit the art galleries in major cities. The Robert Art Gallery spends about £30,000 a year to collect artistic masterpieces, which is said to be the most magnificent of all the art galleries in the British Empire.

However, Australia has a very small population, and artists and musicians are willing to move to London or other large cities in order to seek greater development. With abundant income, life is naturally better.

Australian Wool is the Best in the World

Australia's sheep farming is the most prosperous in the world. The wool produced is of high quality and quantity, and enjoys a high reputation. Australia has about 110 million sheep, with an annual production of about 995 million pounds, valued at £54.971 million, which is Australia's most important industry.

For example, the British sculptor Mackennal, the artist Menpes, and the poet, playwright, and music critic Dunn are all Australians; and the European artist Gillba and the American artist Granger never deny that they are descendants of Australians. There are also many talented Australian scientists and doctors.

Australian children are all subject to free compulsory education until the age of fourteen, so except for immigrants, it can be said that there is no illiteracy. There are a large number of national, private, and church-run primary and secondary schools. In addition, there are also special agricultural schools and experimental farms, which teach theory and practice in order to promote scientific farming methods. The Australian Railway Department, the Ministry of Agriculture, the Ministry of Education, and the Ministry of Health cooperate to run a "Farm Improvement Train." In essence, this is a mobile agricultural college on wheels. Experts travel back and forth with the army, lecturing and demonstrating various methods to improve agricultural production to farmers.

### Communist Organization Cracked Down on in Argentina

Buenos Aires, Argentina, 9th - Huitong News Agency: The commander of the Argentine gendarmerie announced that after the arrest of the communist Angra, a large-scale communist organization was cracked down on in the El Chaco region.

### The Kazakh Republic is Rich in Coal

Moscow, 7th - Havas News Agency: It is reported that the Kazakh Republic of the Soviet Union is rich in coal, with even more reserves than the Donets Basin. Several large factories in the occupied areas are reportedly being built and put into operation in the republic. The President of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, Komarov, is leading many scientists and economists to Almaty (the capital of the Kazakh Republic) to conduct inspections. In addition to investigating existing construction, they are also formulating a grand development plan to change the entire economic structure of the Soviet Union. Among them, the current urgent task is to mine coal and refine oil. According to Komarov, the Kazakh Republic is one of the most important territories of the Soviet Union, so it must be made the largest industrial zone in the world. The current construction plan is not only for temporary war needs, but also to implement the government's policy of shifting the economic center of gravity to the east. Therefore, the southeastern border must be vigorously developed. The Kazakh Republic covers a vast area, about one-tenth of the total land area of the Soviet Union, bordering the Caspian Sea to the west and the Ural Mountains to the east. Coal, copper, lead, zinc, iron, oil, chromium, tungsten, manganese, and other mineral resources, as well as various chemical raw materials, especially potassium, are extremely rich in reserves. Our current task is to manage the existing coal and iron mining in the Karaganda region. Several important iron factories have now started operation, and several power plants are under construction. The mining of copper mines is also being promoted. In addition, attention should also be paid to agriculture and animal husbandry.

Datong News Agency reports that, according to reporters, citizens in the Central District, the Zhabei District, and the Jing'an Temple District have already received official citizen certificates. Citizens in other districts are still in the process of applying. As for the previously reported news that rationing of food based on population count would be implemented starting from the 16th of this month, it is still too early. However, both the Municipal Council and the Baojia Department are planning this.

Restrictions on Certificate Issuance by the French Municipal Council

The French Municipal Council, in order to prevent epidemics, has stipulated that residence certificates will only be issued to those who submit their own epidemic prevention certificate when applying. Furthermore, the Xuhui District Baojia Preparatory Committee has been working extremely hard since its establishment. Under the supervision of Pang Si, the director of the Baojia Office in the district, and the supervision of Zhong Youlin, Chen Fukang, Zhang Renzhong, Wang Liting and other members, all of the previously issued household registration forms, guarantee certificates, and master household registers for the 68 Baojia units in the district were collected. The district has now issued a notice to residents, urging boys and girls over the age of seven to quickly take a 1.5-inch photo in preparation for receiving their identity cards in the future.

### Safe Deposit Boxes at the Mercantile Bank Have Been Opened on Behalf of Customers

Because the Mercantile Bank issued a notice requiring safe deposit boxes to be opened by a certain deadline, or else the bank would open them on behalf of the customers in order to inspect the items deposited inside, the bank has already opened all safe deposit boxes on behalf of customers before the 13th of last month. All items deposited in the vault will continue to be stored on behalf of the customers. As for the safe deposit boxes at the Datong Bank, the bank is still waiting for customers to come and open them. The opening time is from 10:00 AM to 1:00 PM.

### Physical Examinations for Passengers Going to Guangdong are Extremely Serious, Otherwise Problems Will Occur Upon Landing, and Passengers on the Same Ship Will Be Affected

The Shanghai Guangdong Fellow Villagers Association is actively proceeding with helping fellow villagers return to their hometowns. The first group of 158 fellow villagers left for Guangdong by boat on April 25, and the second group of 252 fellow villagers also departed on May 3. There are still over 800 fellow villagers who have registered and urgently want to return to Guangdong. The association is in contact with ships so that they can leave Shanghai as soon as possible. Most of these fellow villagers from Guangdong are unemployed and destitute. If they are indeed poor, they can apply to the association to be exempted from paying the boat fare, but they must find a reliable guarantor and pay eight military yen for meals. However, the association still has to pay 23 military yen for each fellow villager returning to their hometown. The ships evacuating fellow villagers sail to Guangzhou and also stop in Shantou. Both places have offices to receive fellow villagers returning to their hometowns. It has recently been learned that the Guangdong province is very serious about the physical examinations of passengers entering the country. In addition to having the necessary epidemic prevention certificate and smallpox vaccination certificate, those who have not fully recovered from typhoid fever, lung disease, scarlet fever, dysentery, etc., and those with abnormal body temperature and pale complexions, must be examined by a doctor in advance and deemed feasible before they can register. Otherwise, not only will the passengers themselves have problems when landing, but all the fellow villagers on the same ship will be affected.

### Sub-landlords Imprisoned for Five Days for Not Obtaining Licenses, or Fined 20 Yuan

All 18 households are sub-landlords who have not obtained licenses and have violated the land regulations. Summonses were issued ordering them to appear in court. After interrogation, they were sentenced to five days of imprisonment or a fine of 20 yuan each. Those who resisted the summons will be arrested.

### First Day of Exchanging Old Legal Tender: The Maximum Amount Exchanged by an Individual is Only 1,000 Old Legal Tender

According to the Continental News, on the 8th, the old legal tender exchanged by the Central Reserve Bank and 116 exchange banks totaled 20 million yuan. One hundred and eight Chinese banks, eight Japanese banks, and money shops designated to handle the exchange were allowed to exchange the total amount of Central Reserve Bank notes. The limit was originally 10,000 old legal tender per person, but in fact, the highest amount exchanged by each person the day before yesterday was only 2,000 old legal tender.

### Transportation of North China Coal to Shanghai is Under Negotiation, Chinese Coal Prices Expected to Decrease, Coal Prices for Electricity Companies 20% Lower

Domei News Agency reports that since the outbreak of the war, the coal used by factories and citizens in the Shanghai concessions has depended on supplies from the Japanese side. Therefore, in February, major Chinese coal merchants in Shanghai organized the Greater China Coal Company, under the guidance of the Shanghai Coal Association, to begin managing the controlled allocation of coal supplied by the Japanese side. However, until today, the price of coal supplied to the Chinese is slightly higher than the price of coal supplied to the Japanese. In view of this, the Coal Association intends to reduce the price of coal used by the Chinese from the second half of this year to be equal to the price of coal used by the Japanese, in order to realistically suppress prices and stabilize the lives of the Chinese. However, in order to realize the above measures, the stored coal purchased at high prices before the war must first be sold out, and the transportation of North China coal to Shanghai must be smooth in the future. It has recently been learned that the Central China Liaison Department of the Asia Development Board is negotiating with the authorities concerned in North China on the issue of the purchase price of North China coal. At the same time, it is expected that the transportation of North China coal to Shanghai will be smooth in the future, so it is possible to reduce the allocation price of coal in Shanghai to a certain extent. In addition, the price of coal used by the Shanghai Electric Power Company, which is managed by the Japanese army, has been reduced by 23% compared with the previous price, and the coal used by other factories managed by the Japanese army is also supplied at a special price.

### Yokoyama, Spokesman for the Japanese Information Department, Arrives in Shanghai

It is said that Lieutenant Colonel Yokoyama will attend the next regular press conference on Friday, June 12, but the date on which Lieutenant Colonel Akiyama will depart for Tokyo to take office has not yet been decided. Lieutenant Colonel Yokoyama is fluent in French and contributed greatly to the conclusion of the Joint Defense Agreement between Japan and Vietnam last year.

### Beneficial Bank Resumes Second Withdrawal - Chinese Deposits Exceeding Savings Certificates of 5,000 Yuan Temporarily Frozen Pending Investigation

After the first withdrawal from Beneficial Bank began on the fourth of last month, it has been over five weeks, and most depositors have already withdrawn their funds. The bank has begun handling the second withdrawal starting yesterday, with seven detailed measures: Starting June 9th, each account can withdraw ten percent of the balance remaining after deducting 2,000 yuan from the closing balance on December 6th of last year. If a depositor's total previous withdrawals exceed 2,000 yuan, the excess amount will be deducted from the second withdrawal amount. The remaining deposit balance after deducting the first withdrawal amount will be transferred to an account opened at the Japanese-owned Bank of Chosen, but all future transactions will still be handled at this bank. Chinese deposits exceeding 5,000 yuan in savings certificates will be temporarily frozen, pending a decision by the Japanese authorities regarding the credibility of the depositors. Deposits of indebted depositors will also be temporarily frozen, pending the settlement of their debts. Depositors whose deposits have been transferred must immediately bring their passbooks to the bank to have the "Bank of Chosen Deposit" stamp affixed. For this second batch of payments, neutral nationals can withdraw the full amount at once, while Allied nationals are limited to 150 yuan in savings certificates per week.

### Foreign Nationals and American POWs Can Now Communicate - Parcels Can Also Be Sent Through the Red Cross

The Shanghai Committee of the International Red Cross announced yesterday morning that foreign residents of this city can now send parcels and letters to American POWs detained in Jiangwan and Wusong on the 10th and 25th of each month. The first batch will be sent out on June 25th. According to the current provisional measures, each prisoner can only send one reply letter and two postcards every three months. However, it is hoped that permission will soon be granted for prisoners to exchange more information with their relatives and friends. According to Igor, a representative of the International Red Cross in Shanghai, foreign residents of this city are limited to two letters to one prisoner, but can send two letters to another prisoner. These letters and parcels should be sent as soon as possible to the Red Cross office at 97 Yuanmingyuan Road. Funds can also be sent to the prisoners, using military scrip, not exceeding ten yuan each time. The Shanghai Committee of the International Red Cross has recently taken over the work of the POW Relief Committee.

### From the Yan Le Society to the Music School

— Mingyi

In this corner of Shanghai, although the flames of war are raging all over the world, culture and commerce are still thriving. The musical atmosphere grows richer year by year. Last month can be said to have been an unprecedentedly active time for the music scene, with no less than a dozen or twenty concerts. At the beginning of this month, the Shanghai Municipal Council Orchestra held a farewell concert. After that, there was a sense of silence. After listening to the various concerts, the reporter will try to give a general and detailed account of them, as far as memory serves:

Technically, the Shanghai Municipal Council Orchestra and the regular concerts of a certain Mr. are still considered the best. It is a pity that the piano accompaniment in the latter was technically too poor, which detracted from the performance of Soloist Adler. Piano accompaniment is even more difficult than soloing, and those with poorer skills should not attempt it lightly.

The most impressive was the Chinese Youth Concert, which introduced us to several new musicians.

The most promising events were the Shanghai Conservatory of Music student concert and the Zhao's students' concert. Our young musicians will surely be able to take on the responsibility of building a new music scene in ten years. They are all outstanding and very lovely.

The most regrettable concert was Helen Shih's recital. Ms. Shih's piano technique is indeed quite accomplished, but why put an accordion performance together to cater to low-level tastes? This shows the level of cultivation of the artist. We are naturally not against playing the accordion, but it is best performed in the living room or at a carnival. A concert should be serious, especially a solo recital by an artist. We hope that Ms. Shih will give us a purely artistic performance in the future.

The seed sown by a concert encourages countless young people to study, and in a few years another batch of flowers and fruits will be presented to us. But what about the soil for cultivating the seeds? Let's also take a look at how many music schools have opened in this metropolis.

The old National Conservatory of Music has long ceased to exist due to the death of its president, Dr. Xiao Youmei. The former Conservatory of Music had a glorious history. Nineteen out of ten musicians in China came from the Conservatory of Music. Conservatory of Music, Conservatory of Music. When will we meet the Chinese people again?

The reporter has not visited Ms. Wang Ruixian's Children's Music Institute, but judging from the piano technique of Wang's ten-year-old son, Dong Guangguang, the institute must be well-run.

The Shanghai Conservatory of Music was reorganized from the Shanghai Music Hall. Principal Ding Shande has worked hard for four or five years, and one cannot help but admire his educational enthusiasm. Despite the fact that unscrupulous music brokers want to destroy them, their achievements are getting better year by year.

The music department of the Shanghai Academy of Fine Arts is short of leadership, and at best can only be considered a preparatory course for a formal music school. Therefore, students with a little talent will, after studying for a year and a half, fly like fledglings and move to other schools to find their future. The Shanghai Academy of Fine Arts is a school with a considerable status, so why does the music department always remain so dim?

In addition, there are too many single-front music schools to be listed one by one. Among the many up-and-coming schools, there is the music school attached to the Music Education Association. The host is composer Qian Renkang. Experts preside over all departments of theory, piano, violin, and vocal music. The teaching method is especially strict. Although music is regarded as a plaything by many people, real skills can only be hoped for if they are supervised by a strict teacher. This school is located on the fourth floor of No. 4, Lane 215, Maite Hesitelu Road, and few people outside know about it, because they value practice and do not advocate empty words. It has only been open for a little over a year, and it has already cultivated a considerable number of young musicians. The reporter visited the school the other day, and thinking that they are still making music in this turbulent world, their spirit is admirable. In the future, it will not be difficult to train many new talents for the music scene.

### Shanghai Municipal Council Advises Citizens Returning to Their Hometowns to Get Vaccinated - So That They Can Show Proof Upon Arrival at Their Destination

The Information Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council issued a public notice stating that citizens preparing to leave Shanghai to return to their hometowns should, for the sake of prudence, be vaccinated in this city so that they can present a vaccination certificate upon arrival at their destination. Those who are willing to be vaccinated can go to the following locations nearby to request vaccination: No. 34 Hankou Road, Technical Student Branch; No. 667 Fuzhou Road, Health Department; No. 380 Avenue Road, Health Branch; No. 160 Macgen Road, Health Branch; No. 4 Laobosen Road, Health Branch; Avenue Road Police Station; Jing'an Temple Police Station; Central Police Station; Gordon Road Police Station; Laozha Police Station.

### Shen Bao Readers' Scholarship Fund Converted into Savings Certificates

As of June 6, the Shen Bao Readers' Scholarship Fund had a balance of 67,396.19 yuan. The bank has now converted this amount into 33,698.09 yuan in savings certificates at a ratio of two to one. Yesterday, we received savings certificate checks for 500 yuan from the Shanghai Cotton Exchange Brokers Association, 24 yuan from Shi Xinquan (economic manuscript fee for April and May, calculated at 48 yuan in old legal tender), and 2.5 yuan from Qiu Rulong (calculated at 5 yuan in old legal tender), totaling 526.5 yuan in savings certificates. Combined with the previous amount, the total deposit in savings certificates is 34,224.59 yuan.

### Additional Registration Office Set Up for Sending Coffins to Ningbo from Shanghai - Located East of Jinmen Hotel

The Guohua Funeral Parlor Siming Association in this city is handling the transportation of coffins sent from Shanghai to Ningbo. For the past month, it has been deeply satisfying the families of the deceased. It has transported coffins to Ningbo several times, and the care and arrangements have been extremely meticulous. Therefore, the number of people registering to transport coffins has been very enthusiastic recently. The original office was located in the Guohua office at No. 7 Anle Village, Fuxu Road, but due to inconvenient transportation, it was not enough to meet the demand. From today, it will expand the registration office and open an office at No. 96, east of the Jinmen Hotel at the Racecourse, Jing'an Temple Road. In the future, it can closely cooperate with the transportation department of Jindou Company to handle all registration and transportation matters. All families of the deceased from Ningbo can go to the new address to negotiate.

### Transportation Company Colludes with Party to Lease Ships and Defraud Money

Chen Zhangsheng, the owner of the Universal Transportation Company at No. 1 Xingye Lane, Tiantang Street, French Concession, colluded with Wu Ronghua and his younger brother Guanhua at No. 3, Lane 297, Tailasituo Road in September last year, falsely claiming to Dong Qiming, the owner of Tongxiang Shipping Company on the third floor of the Bank of Communications at No. 16, that there was a Portuguese merchant ship, Steamboat Shengde, represented by the Far East Company, which was now intended to be leased out, with a monthly rent of 42,000 yuan. If they co-invested in the lease, they would definitely make a profit. Dong was tempted and signed a lease contract. After the contract was signed, he realized that the ship's nationality was unknown and could not set sail. He then approached the authorities for mediation and was granted recognition. Just as he was about to set sail, Wu and others used various excuses to stay, successively defrauding Dong of 20,000 yuan. When Dong scheduled to load cargo and set sail, the authorities issued an order on January 14 this year, ordering the unloading of cargo and the cessation of navigation. Only then did Dong realize that Chen and others had fabricated the entire scheme to deceive him. He immediately reported the information to the French Police and filed a lawsuit against Chen and others, who were arrested and detained, and the money was pursued.

### Rice Purchase Bureau Requires Proof of Vaccination - Starting on the 16th

The Information Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council officially announced that, starting on the 16th of this month, citizens must present proof of vaccination when purchasing rice from rice stores and sales offices of this bureau in the Public Concession. Those who have not yet been vaccinated and obtained a certificate should quickly request vaccination and issuance of a certificate from the various vaccination offices of the Health Department. In cooperation with the Epidemic Prevention Committee, the French Concession authorities have decided that, starting on the 15th of this month, rice cannot be purchased from retail rice vendors without a vaccination certificate. When purchasing rice, police officers will ask to inspect the certificate. In addition, free vaccination injections will be administered at the following locations in the French Concession. Please pay attention to this: Health Department of the Public Works Bureau (No. 630 Baylor Road), Health Department (No. 840 Xujiahui Road), Intersection of Haig Road and Shanzhong Road, Intersection of Julai Road and Sacred Mother's Court Road. (Vaccinations will be administered all day at the above locations.) Xiaocaishang, Baxianqiao; Xiaocaishang, Ximen Road; Intersection of Mintiniyin Road and Lanweizhan Road; Mintiniyin Road and Aduoya Road; Intersection of Laobeimen and Minguo Road. (Vaccinations will be administered only in the afternoon at the above locations.)

### Heinous Parricide to be Hanged This Morning - A Notorious Thief to be Executed Simultaneously

The tragic patricide case of the Zhou brothers on Haig Road in western Shanghai, which shocked the entire society, has been sentenced to death after three trials. The Zhou brothers, Qinji and Qinxiang, are still being held in the Tilanqiao Prison in eastern Shanghai, awaiting execution. According to the reporter's investigation, they will be transferred to the Nanshi Railway Station Detention Center this morning for execution by hanging. The original handling police station on Jing'an Temple Road has been notified to take the two unfilial sons from Tilanqiao Prison. After questioning, they will be escorted to Nanshi for execution. It is also heard that a notorious thief will be executed in the same execution ground at the same time.

### Secretary of Minli Middle School Suspected of Embezzling Rice Funds

Wang Tiyu, a Shanghai native who lives at No. 6, Lane 197, Gubalu Road, is the secretary of Minli Middle School at No. 414 Weihaiwei Road. In February of this year, Wang told the school that he planned to purchase 100 bags of rice, valued at 20,000 yuan, and had entrusted his friend Hong Yangsheng (i.e., Housheng) to purchase the rice on his behalf. The money had been paid in full, he said. However, until recently, there was no news of the rice. Principal Su Yingjie asked Wang about this, and he was evasive and unable to respond. He then reported this information to the Chengdu Road Police Station, accusing Wang of embezzlement. Detective Tan Jinhai arrested Wang Tiyu yesterday and arrested Hong Yangchun at No. 299 Fuxu Road without success. Only Hong's mother, Luo, was arrested and taken to the police station for detention and investigation.

### More Than 10,000 Yuan Robbed

Shunxing Rice Shop at No. 48 Xiaoyou Lane, Xujiahui Road, western Shanghai: At about 4 o'clock in the morning yesterday, three bandits suddenly arrived. One of them threatened with a gun and robbed the shop of more than 10,000 yuan in legal tender before leaving in triumph.

### Northern District Visa Office Moves into the Public Works Department

The Information Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council announced that the office for issuing return-to-hometown permits, currently located in the Northern District Primary School on Kenan Road, will be moved to the storage place of the Public Works Department at the corner of Beidong Road and Bazilu Road on Wednesday, the 10th of this month.

### A Tour of the Bird Market (1)

— Jialiang

Please close your eyes and imagine the stereotype of a certain type of person: with the collar unbuttoned and the sleeves rolled up, one hand holding two or three birdcages tied together, and the other hand forcefully pushing the hat he is wearing backwards, with half of his hair exposed in the front, making cooing sounds to tease the birds.

This is a very common form of recreation or hobby for the lower middle class - raising birds. Every morning and evening, when the sun breaks through the morning mist and brings back the liveliness of the earth, or when the sun slowly sets below the horizontal line, leaning against the clock tower of the Racecourse: near Qingcaotan, the intersection of Chu Xiaqing Road, Guangdong Road, and Racecourse Road, is crowded with the type of people mentioned above. They are not an organized group, but through the birds and the interest in playing with birds, they come to that place, weaving together the scene of what is commonly called the "Bird Market".

The Old City God Temple Moved Here

There are bird shops in the "Bird Market". Some of these shops moved from the City God Temple in the city. I still remember five or six years ago, it was easy to see bird shops, bird stalls, bird vendors, and bird players by the Nine-Bend Bridge and on the second floor of the Delighted Building. Once the war broke out, they scattered, stopped business, and closed down. Because business was sluggish, they moved in groups to the concession to pick a convenient place and open up a new "Bird Underworld". Although the birds are closed in cages, they are still the masters of that world. Those who trade in birds, play with birds...have simply become the most loyal servants of the birds. "Can humans be inferior to birds?"

The motives of people who come to the "Bird Market" are not very consistent. Some people raise good birds for others to admire and praise, and boast that they are good at raising birds; some people come to test the birds' voices, and they like to put their own birds next to the birds of people who sing loudly and well, so that their own birds may not be outdone and also sing; some people do not raise birds themselves, but specialize in criticizing other people's birds, speaking ill of them; some can be said to be "bird brokers," who are good at selling; some villagers catch birds and sell them with a thin rope tied to a short stick; there are also vendors who sell bird food.

If you close your eyes over there, you may appreciate the musical sound of the birds, but once you open your eyes, everything is chaotic.

Thrush and Oriole

Almost all kinds of birds available for people to enjoy are there. Among them, the most common are the thrush, which is green-haired, black-tailed, clever, small, and flexible with a circle of white around the eyes, and the oriole, which is bright and eye-catching and adorably yellow all over. There are many other types that cannot be named by non-"bird playing experts". In addition to birds, there are also turtles, rabbits, toads, frogs, squirrels, etc. Although it is not worthy of being called a zoo, some animals are not found in ordinary zoos, especially several rare birds. In addition to trading birds, the bird shops there also sell bird food, small bird food jars, birdcages, and other equipment needed for raising birds.

Around the Qingcaotan in the middle of the road and near the low wall of the Racecourse, in relatively spacious places, the walls, trees, and telephone poles are temporarily hung with birdcages. Those "bird guests" talk to each other.

"Brother, it's really unlucky today. My two birds were scared by a cat." An old man with untidy clothes and all the buttons unbuttoned except for his underwear said with interest.

"Sigh!" is a half-surprised and half-doubtful rhetorical question:

### Memories of Old Travels

— Qian Ding

The next morning, I went up the mountain with Mr. Chen to Yibu Dengtian (One Step to Heaven). The so-called Yibu Dengtian is a rock at the top of Wuliangguan Mountain that is dangerously perched in the air. People can step on it with one foot, hence it is one of the famous scenic spots of this mountain. Climbing this peak, one can only see mountains surrounding it on all sides, overlooking the peaks from the sky, and one truly feels ethereal and immortal, and detached from the world. One cannot help but praise the unfathomable wonder and divinity of nature! At noon, we returned to the courtyard for a meal. At the end of the hour, we toured the Five Buddha Peak. Because I had not explored the path clearly, I mistakenly entered a fork in the road. I retreated and asked a passerby, and then I was able to follow this mountain road and advance. Mr. Chen rested on the mountainside because of foot pain, while I mustered my courage and went up, surpassing the summit and ascending to it. Near the summit, there was a lonely pine tree facing danger, named "Lifesaving Pine", because to cross this dangerous situation, one must climb this pine tree to pass the danger and advance. After passing this Lifesaving Pine, one must climb the rock wall, which is steep and one dares not look back. Climbing to the summit, I was drenched in sweat. At that time, the clouds and mountains were beautiful, and the high wind was blowing. Spreading my clothes and facing it, my heart was heroic and my spirit was strong. Looking down at the valleys of Mount Gong, they were completely merged into one breath. The grandeur of the scenery cannot be described in words. After experiencing this magnificent scenery, I took advantage of the mood and wielded the brush. Although the painting was completed, it did not express even one ten-thousandth of it. After finishing the painting, I went down the original path. Mr. Chen was originally resting on the mountainside. When he saw me coming, he greeted me and said, "I have been waiting for you here for a long time. I didn't see you come back and thought you were in danger. I was very anxious." I immediately apologized repeatedly and told him: "At the moment when you were anxious, was the time when I was appreciating the strange scenery and forgetting myself." As we talked and walked, in the sunset, we looked at the Wuliangguan Avenue and went back, and agreed to climb the mountain to watch the sunrise tomorrow. We went to the temple together, then had dinner and chatted for a while before going to bed.

The next day, at dawn, I woke up first and called Mr. Chen to get up. We put on our clothes and went out, and saw that the moonlight was still bright, the frost and snow were all over the ground, the pine forest was quiet, and the lying mountain was not surprised. We slowly walked up the steps to the Guanyin Cave, and Mr. Chen and I stood in front of the cave to watch the sunrise. But after waiting for a long time, we did not see it come out. Mr. Chen said that there were clouds blocking it in the distance, and the sun had probably already risen. Later, Mr. Chen could not bear it and went down the mountain first, while I still stood and watched. Before long, a round of red sun leaped up, accompanied by clouds, beautiful and dazzling, but I did not have time to paint it, so I took a photo and went down the mountain. After breakfast, I made plans to return with Mr. Chen. There were still scenic spots such as the Immortal's Terrace that we had not visited.

On the way back, we did not take the original road, but changed to go southwest. At that time, frost and snow covered the ground, and it was difficult to walk in the cold and wet. Crossing a ridge, Mr. Chen suffered from it. The scenery along the way was excellent. Looking back at the peaks, they were lightly dressed in plain clothes. The lush forests and verdant trees were close to the mountain, and the sparse trees had residual red, and a line of morning sun added to the fun, forming a perfect picture. Crossing Dagushan, we entered the plain. It was noon, and we found a small restaurant and had a pound of noodles with Mr. Chen. At that time, the weather felt even colder, so we hurried back. When we arrived in Anshan, we still returned to Fan via the South Manchuria Road. The equipment in the car was clean and beautiful, and the management was well-organized. Compared with the situation of the Beining car, how can we not be vigilant in our hearts?

When we arrived in Shenyuan, the lights were already bright. After getting off the car, I went to a restaurant with Mr. Chen for a snack, and then we took a bath together in the First Pool, chatting naked about the travels in Qianshan, and felt happy and forgot our fatigue.

According to the Qianshan Travel Notes, I only briefly recorded the general outline at that time, which is not enough to see. However, the scenery I appreciated and the conversation with the Taoist priest made me stay in my heart forever. I regret that the time for the tour was too short at that time, and the scenery was in a hurry, so what I gained was not profound. After this wonderful tour, I repeatedly wrote sketches and pencil sketches, and after pondering them, I created Chinese paintings (ink paintings). Most of the new works after this tour were requested by friends in the journey. Thinking back to fifteen years ago, although my learning was insufficient, my enthusiasm for painting was indeed worth mentioning. According to my experience, when visiting scenic spots, because the scenery changes and the atmosphere is new, I feel that everything is enough to inspire emotion and beauty, and my heart is open and my spirit is active, and my interest is vigorous and my writing is effective. Also, after a new tour, my body and mind are slightly calm, and the new impressions I have gained often feel clear and appear in my mind. If I write at this time, there will definitely be a new look to see. Therefore, every family must spread out everything, constantly experience the body and mind, enrich their learning, broaden their knowledge, and improve day by day in order to reach the path of artistic creation and construct the perfect realm of art. This is the most interesting and pleasant thing. (To be continued)

### Wan Shoushan Restaurant Shareholding Dispute - Refusal to Hand Over Account Books and Share Funds, Wang Rufuo and Two Others Arrested

Later, due to soaring prices and insufficient original shares, they re-solicited new shares up to one million yuan and held an inaugural meeting. However, because the shareholders demanded that Wang and the other two hand over the account books and the previously collected share funds, Wang and others refused. Therefore, shareholder representatives Luo Jingwei and others reported to the Laozha Police Station, accusing Wang and others of embezzling 188,500 yuan in public funds. Investigator Sun Dafa arrested Wang and the others yesterday and temporarily detained them, pending further investigation of the case before further action is taken.

### Fluctuations in Gold Prices are Huge

Yesterday's cash gold prices in the black market first rose sharply and then turned down: the fluctuations were huge, and an unprecedented high price of 24,200 yuan appeared, which was due to the rising momentum of the previous day. However, there were rumors of cotton yarn control, which suddenly fell sharply, and many parties also became panicked. The huge amount of sales from the Tianjin gang led to a sharp decline, and the price finally rose in name but fell in reality. The general sentiment in all parties is still upward. The opening price this morning per (ten taels) was 23,000 yuan, which was 1,100 yuan higher than the afternoon closing price of the previous day, and similar to the afternoon price. At times, cash stores and certain gangs actively entered the market, and a certain securities firm acting on behalf of the Tianjin gang also took in a little. For a time, suppliers were watching and the price rose by 1,200 yuan in scarce transactions, with the highest transaction price being 24,200 yuan. Unexpectedly, the Tianjin gang suddenly sold a huge amount through three securities firms, and seeing that cotton yarn was falling sharply amid negative rumors, the market situation became even more volatile, and the price plummeted by 2,400 yuan, falling to a low of 21,800 yuan. Gold stores and certain gangs entered again, raising it to 23,000 yuan. The Tianjin gang sold again: the afternoon closing price was 22,800 yuan, which was 900 yuan higher than the closing price of the previous day, and a difference of 200 yuan from the afternoon price, with a difference of 2,400 yuan. In the afternoon, it rose to 23,000 yuan.

### Gold Pounds Continue to Rise

Yesterday, the interest rate of the Money Industry Association was 1.5 jiao. New exchange clearing was nominally flat, but a surcharge of 10 to 20 yuan per thousand yuan was required. New and old legal tender was 2 yuan, and 2 yuan 04 or 08 fen.

### Government Bonds Advance Without Retreating; Type A Bonds Have Exceeded 80 Yuan

Yesterday, the price of government bonds in the black market continued to rise sharply amid widespread absorption. The prices of all bonds exceeded 70 yuan, and Type A bonds even exceeded 80 yuan. The market prices of all bonds have exceeded the listed prices at the time of the market closure on August 1, 1937, which is truly commendable. The asset class all regards this as an ideal world and a place to return to, so how can the market price not be good? The rise the day before yesterday could still be said to be that large investors temporarily stopped selling, but yesterday it continued to rise despite a large amount of selling. The strength of reality over spot is indeed a true principle and cannot be measured by common sense. However, due to a lack of unity, it cannot be said that there will be only advances and no retreats from now on. Yesterday, Quan Gong Tong Li sold the most, and Tong Shun Xin Ji De Fu Tong Kang Hu He Ji all cut off many scattered retail investors. There were also many short positions, which were taken up by Qian Yi Shun Tai Wu He Da Tong Yi Tai Lian He Yong Kang Ren Chang and other firms. With the market price so high, buyers did not dislike its high price, and as a result, it rose another 2 yuan to 3 yuan 1 jiao, with approximately 3 million yuan traded. The details are listed below:

### Broad Beans Rise Sharply by 10 Yuan Due to Limited Arrivals

### Daily Necessities are More Scarce and Prices Rise Endlessly

The selling price of daily necessities has risen but not fallen, and the stock of goods is quite short. Generally speaking, cargo owners are unwilling to sell, so new high prices are emerging one after another. Gu Ben soap is priced at 315 yuan, Bai Xiangmao soap is priced at 165 yuan, Huang Xiangmao soap is priced at 130 yuan, and Jian Dao soap is priced at 260 yuan, all of which have risen by more than 10 yuan compared to the previous day.

### No News of Delivery, Cigarette Prices Rise Endlessly

Cigarette prices continue to rise, as there is no news of delivery from the factory, and people are even more determined to hold on to their supplies.

### Yang Naimei Returns to the Stage

— Los Angeles City

Yang Naimei is back in Shanghai! This news has brought a lot of speculation to the people of Shanghai. The outside world has been spreading rumors. The most reliable statement is that Yang Naimei will organize a theater troupe and engage in stage performances. It can be seen that Shanghai people pay quite a lot of attention to this film star who was popular fifteen or sixteen years ago.

Coincidentally, the reporter ran into her at the Lafayette Theater, so the "mystery" of the past few months has been clarified. She said, "Since I left the Shanghai film industry, I went to Hong Kong. During my years in Hong Kong, I got married and haven't acted. Last November, I received a telegram from Shanghai that my mother was seriously ill. This of course made me very anxious. I immediately took a boat back to Shanghai, but unfortunately, my mother passed away and abandoned me! During the mourning period, I originally planned to return to Hong Kong, but the Pacific War broke out, so I had to stay in Shanghai.

For the past six months, my friends in Shanghai have been persuading me to continue filming, but I don't feel interested in movies. I have decided not to make any plans to film. But I still love art. I admire spoken drama very much, especially since spoken drama in Shanghai has been making leaps and bounds in recent years. I think it is necessary for me to make some contributions to this area as well.

At that time, it happened that a few friends also had plans to organize a theater troupe. This made me very happy. After several discussions, we decided to start performing in mid-June. The first play is - "Wang Xifeng."

Everyone knows the story of Dream of the Red Chamber, but it is worth mentioning that Wang Xifeng is a typical figure of most Chinese women, so we hope to take this opportunity to visualize Zhu Xifeng. This play includes Wang Xifeng's life. In fact, the emphasis is on the three segments of setting up the Acacia Bureau, making a big disturbance in the Ningguo Mansion, and entrusting orphans, and the special emphasis is on Wang Xifeng's personality.

I want to take on the role of Wang Xifeng. Although in some places it is suitable for my: personality, this is my first attempt, and I hope that all parties will give me a lot of advice.

Old Master Zeng, who is in his seventies, still wants to support the declining family passed down from his ancestors in an unsatisfactory situation. However, on the other hand, the Zeng family's young master, wife, Miss, and the third generation of the Zeng family, those young people, have different thoughts, different experiences, and different pains. - His central idea is: "Let yesterday's Peking Man die, and tomorrow's Peking Man has grown up."

I really love this play, although he may not be accepted by a large audience in terms of stage performance conditions, because there are too many characters and the atmosphere is relatively serious and depressing. If the actors' acting skills are too poor, then it will fail to the point of being incomprehensible.

I didn't have the chance to see Ying Yin performing "Peking Man" in "Shangyi." Recently, the Chinese drama circle also arranged a performance, with Sun Jinglang, Di Fan, Qiu Quan, Leng Shan, Zhou Chu, Li Ji, Ma Xiaonong, Jin Lei, etc. participating. The director is Jiang Tuo.

The script has been deleted and revised, so the emotional aspects are not taken care of very naturally. However, the dedication of the director and each actor should be encouraged.

Sun Jing's Zeng Siyi, Leng Shan's Jiang Tai, and Qiu Quan's Old Master Zeng can all grasp the personality in every detail. Ma Xiaonong's Chen Nanny has a good appearance. Zhou Chu's anthropologist and Xu Tai's Northern Dong people fit their identities. Di Fan's Fang and Li Ji's Zeng Ting are not pleasing in the play, but they perform with great effort. The most successful performance in the entire play is Jin Lei's Xiao Zhu'er. Her every move is engraved in my heart and can never be forgotten. - This is a very promising actor.

### Listening to Songs - Random Notes

— Yan Qing

Song Baoluo is a Liu-style old male actor. Since Hongsheng passed away, there has been a lack of successors to the Liu style. As for today, Guiran is like the beacon of the Lu Temple, and the only ones who show their brilliance are Song and Chen Hongsheng. Both Chen and Song have come to Shanghai to sing for many months, and the people here should be familiar with them. The two artists have their own strengths. Song wins with his voice, and Chen wins with his rhyme. There is no need to argue about who is better or worse. However, Song follows the rules, and Chen writes new plays. On the whole, it seems that Song is better than Chen. This statement should not be biased. However, Song has a major problem that people do not like, which is that he has a female voice when singing. I think that if Song can work hard to exercise, he may be able to make up for this natural defect. It is not known. I went to see Song perform Beheading the Yellow Robe. The general idea of the play is that Emperor Taizu of the Song Dynasty became emperor and married Han Longmei and Sumei as wives. The Han siblings were killed by Zheng En because Taizu was drunk and falsely issued an imperial decree. Zheng's wife, Tao Sanchun, learned about it and forced the city with troops to avenge Zheng. Song had no choice but to behead the Han siblings to apologize to Tao, and Sanchun led the troops away. The first half of the play is also known as Entering the Beautiful Concubine. Baoluo performed this play very hard. In the section of the king being drunk in the Peach Blossom Palace, the word "lai" in Han Sumei's "lai", and the word "jiu" in the brother's title of "State Uncle" are all lightly described, and I feel that they have subtle and distant, unique points. On the city tower, Song's Allegro is clear in every word and pertinent in every sentence. The voice is also sweet and melodious, and the high notes are handled with ease. The singing is like spring thunder. If it were not for the entanglement of the female voice, he would be a strong enemy of Fuying.

Huang Jin posted a notice on the 3rd that he would perform the Lost Sky Beheading and Yu Tang Chun, and invited the famous ticket holder Zhang Zhesheng to assist Ji Yuliang. Zhang Gu is a famous ticket holder for Jingjiao. I once listened to Dou Liangdun in Lianhuan Set, and the person who played Huang Tianba was Zhang Zhongyuan. The physical movements and expressions were energetic, the foundation was solid, the voice was broad and Hong, and the copper hammer frame was complete. Even if you seek it in the realm of actors, you can't find it. Huang Guichou is also one of the famous actors of the present time. The excellence of his art can be compared with the four famous Dan actors. The shaking board at the beginning, and the slow board, Er Liu, and running water at the trial, new tunes are constantly emerging, not letting Yan Qiu, but why is he not valued? Said, not trending, not following popular tastes, this is the reason why Guichou cannot become popular, however, if there is real skill, popularity or not is not necessarily to be held in mind. If you don't meet Bole, then the horse's feet will not be stretched, if you don't meet Bian He, then Huan Dou will not be seen, if a good horse meets Bole, then Guichou can surprise everyone. Moreover, the world is not really without Bole, it is just that the time has not come, otherwise, I know that in the future the chief seat among the Dan actors will belong to Guichou.

### Casual Talk about Yue Opera

— Mei Hua Guan Zhu

Shaoxing women's opera first became popular in Hangzhou, Jiaxing, Ningbo, and Yue areas. After the 20th year of the Republic of China, it began to spread to Shanghai. Today, there are many talents and a grand momentum. Among all kinds of local operas, it actually has a leading edge, which cannot be said to be a unique number. I have had little contact with Yue Opera, but I occasionally accepted the invitation of friends to take a break and watch the scenery. I feel that the talents in it are more outstanding in Yao Shuijuan and Wang Xinghua. Yao and Wang are one and the same, each with its own strengths. Yao is intelligent and wins people with his acting skills, so he is the only one who performs new plays. Wang Xue is very strong, and singing has the most foundation. The voice is bright, and the taste is especially interesting. The plays "Pan Fu Su Fu Zhen" and "Bi Yu Zan" really have the magic power to make people want to see them again. If these two people are compared with Peking Opera female actors, Yao is Gou Liucha, and Wang is Cheng Yushuang.

### Divergent Melodies

— Ze Fu

Divergent Melodies are traditionally said to have been created by the Qing Dynasty Eight Banner descendants, Kui Ju Cha or Shi Shu Nian, hence the name. There are two types: Long Divergent Melodies and Short Divergent Melodies. Long Divergent Melodies are commonly known as "Gan Ban," also called "Zhuang Zuo"; Short Divergent Melodies are commonly known as "Cui Nian," also called "Short Eight-Line Divergent Melodies," which are the shortest of the Divergent Melodies, with only eight lines per song. The song titles are mostly named after the opening line, such as the Long Divergent Melodies "The Mule Arrives in a Hurry" and "The Peach and Apricot Flowers are Fragrant," and the Short Divergent Melodies "Boundless Mountain Scenery" and "Half-Covered Gauze Window." The lyrical content is generally nothing more than writing about emotions or praising objects, with very few narrating stories, so the number of words is not many. Long Divergent Melodies have a maximum of 600 words, and Short Divergent Melodies are often less than 100 words. Regardless of length, each piece is divided into three sections: the first is called the "prelude," the second is the "passing section," and the third is the "sleeping ox." The last word of the second section of Short Divergent Melodies must be repeated with the first word of the third section, such as the second section of "Half-Covered Gauze Window," "a dimly lit lamp," and the third section, "the lamp light is half bright," repeating the word "lamp." Long Divergent Melodies do not strictly adhere to this rule, sometimes repeating and sometimes not. This type of singing was very popular during the Qianlong era, and even the palace had singers. Nowadays, it is only used at the beginning of a drum performance or before other types of singing to test and adjust the pitch of the orchestra.

Song Ziping, who learned Sheng roles in her youth and used the stage name Song Xiaoyun, was known as "Covering Henan" when she performed at the Huale Theater in Henan ten years ago. After three years, she returned north and began to learn Qingyi roles. She is proficient in all the famous Dan's plays. Last year, she came to Shanghai for the first time with her elder brother, Song Baoluo, to perform at the Tianchan Stage. Due to stomach problems, she soon stopped performing. This time, she came south with her brother for the second time and switched to the Gengxin Stage. The attached photo is a recent portrait of Ziping.

### Sharing Weal and Woe

— He Jia Zhi

(5) Tit for Tat

A Xing's fist was already prepared, a diagonal punch hitting Fei Changhe's shoulder, he shouted: "Fei Changhe, you want to hit our young master?" Fei Changhe came today feeling emboldened, he had long forgotten the dignity of the Ye family's Shide Hall, he even dared to confront young master Ye, let alone A Xing, and moreover, A Xing had struck him first. He almost popped his eyeballs out, raising the hand that was good at grabbing cards, grabbed A Xing's collar, and shouted: "Hey! Today, I and you brat,..." His anger was first hidden in his eyeballs, then in his throat, and now transferred to his hands, ready to retaliate; Wei Cheng also suddenly stood up, turned the pencil upside down and tapped the table, saying: "None of you are allowed to move!" Before he finished speaking, a crowd of people rushed in from outside the door, one hand pulling Fei Changhe, and the other pulling A Xing, separating the two. He stood in the middle and laughed: "If I, Qin Runzhi, hadn't run fast, the two of you would have fought. You two, one treats fighting in the gambling house as your family skill; the other has the strength of a wild bull in the Ye mansion. Fighting is not allowed, causing someone's death is like hitting young master Ye. Look, outside the door, there are more than just one of the Ye mansion's farmhands; Fei Changhe also has his brothers from the gambling house. If you start fighting, it will be a fierce battle, how is that allowed? Fortunately, I ran fast, it's good that everyone stopped! I, Qin Runzhi, have always liked to be a matchmaker and peacemaker. Today, the inspiration came, it's my turn to be the peacemaker."

Wei Cheng looked up at the door, indeed, there were several heads of different heights, some were his own farmhands He Zixing and Xu Quanfu; the unfamiliar faces were probably all Fei Changhe's accomplices. He was extremely angry, but he did not need A Xing and others to be his lackeys. At that time, he drove A Xing out of the door and said to Qin Runzhi: "What is Fei Changhe? He is deliberately here to make trouble with me today, saying that Shide Hall has never had such a humiliation." At the end of his sentence, he reluctantly addressed Qin Runzhi as Mr. Qin. Fei Changhe shouted strangely: "Heaven is above, I am here to find my niece, having learned that young master Ye instructed her to run to Shanghai, how can I not jump up? My sister, that is a bit of flesh and blood, if I don't jump up, I wouldn't seem like a person. Later, when we started fighting, it was also the Ye family's farmhands who moved first. Mr. Qin, take out your conscience and help me say a word." (96)
