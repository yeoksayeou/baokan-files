### Egypt's Al Alamein Front: Fierce Fighting Continues; Germany Claims Axis Forces Recover Lost Ground, Destroying 104 British Tanks

Lisbon, 26th (Allied News Agency) – General Rommel commanded German and Italian troops and successfully resisted the fierce offensive of the British Eighth Army last night. According to Cairo sources, the Allied forces, including British, Australian, South African, Indian, and Greek soldiers, have captured several positions of the Axis powers. However, Berlin announced that the German army had counter-attacked and recaptured unimportant strongholds in the northern and southern sectors of the front line. All defensive zones and minefields remain in German hands. The British side has spoken cautiously about the battle situation, fearing a repeat of the propaganda errors made during the previous offensive in Libya. For example, a Reuters war correspondent only stated that the fighting was unprecedented and that the future development of the situation was unpredictable.

German Führer Headquarters, 26th (Havas) – German military reports state that a large-scale enemy attack in Egypt resulted in the destruction of 104 tanks. The battle is ongoing. German and Italian air forces are bombing enemy mechanized units day and night, shooting down four enemy planes. The enemy forces attempting to land near Marsa Matruh on the night of the 23rd were repelled.

Berlin, 26th (Havas) – According to a spokesman here, the enemy forces on the Egyptian Al Alamein front launched a fierce attack with land and air forces, marking the beginning of a large-scale offensive. The British side stated that the British forces in North Africa have a million soldiers, a thousand tanks, and a large number of aircraft. It is claimed that the minefields in front of the German-Italian allied positions are the scene of intense fighting.

Rome, 26th (Havas) – According to the Italian military headquarters, fierce fighting is taking place on the Egyptian front. An enemy attack, supported by armored units, has failed, with the loss of 104 tanks. German and Italian aircraft attacked British supply lines and shot down 14 enemy aircraft in aerial combat. An enemy attempt to land in the Marsa Matruh area was met with a dive bomber attack, forcing troop transport boats to turn back, with one sunk. One Italian submarine has not returned.

Bern, Switzerland, 26th (Havas) – According to Berlin sources, British forces continued to attack in the Al Alamein area on the Egyptian front yesterday with a large number of tanks and aircraft, but each attack failed, with countless tanks destroyed, some still burning. However, the British side disregarded the significant setbacks and launched fierce attacks, mobilizing a large number of reserves to the front line to reinforce the troops fighting in the area in the past two days. Meanwhile, according to London sources, the offensive on the Al Alamein front was preceded by an unprecedentedly fierce bombardment. Many Axis soldiers were wounded and captured by the British during the artillery battle. The latest news received by the British side indicates that the initial positions occupied have been maintained. According to reports from British war correspondents, the initial attack involved a significant strategic change. According to precedent, the British army would bombard with artillery fire, followed by a tank charge, with infantry advancing afterward. However, this time, the infantry charged first, followed by the tanks. The reason for this is to reduce the losses of motorized units due to landmines and to pit intact motorized units against the enemy's armored divisions, while ensuring that the defending motorized units can provide assistance at any time if enemy tanks attempt to break through the positions initially occupied by the infantry.

### Plotting to Shorten Transportation Routes: Major Battle Imminent in the Mediterranean

Lisbon, 26th (Havas) – New York dispatch. The New York Herald Tribune commented on the Allied offensive in North Africa yesterday, predicting a large-scale battle in the Mediterranean. It is claimed that the Allied nations are now seizing the advantage in the Egyptian desert to strike at Hitler's southern flank in Europe and shorten maritime transportation routes. Rommel is a genius of desert warfare. As long as he is not dead or captured, the danger will not subside.

Cairo, 15th (Havas) – General Montgomery, commander of the British Eighth Army, told reporters who were departing for the front line for inspection today, "The most terrible war is about to take place tonight and tomorrow morning. At that time, our situation will be even clearer. In short, we have now begun the offensive called for by South African Prime Minister Smuts. The air force under General Cunningham is able to cooperate fully with our ground forces. We have had victories on the North African front in the past, but I dare to say that our soldiers will do their utmost and will definitely continue to advance bravely."

### Wang Jingwei Meets with Reporters in Beiping and Makes a Statement

Beiping, 26th (Central News Agency) – After the Chairman of the National Government arrived in Beiping, he met with more than 50 Chinese and Japanese reporters at the Qin Zheng Hall in Zhongnanhai at 4:10 PM on the 26th. Foreign Minister Chu, Minister Lin Guan, Minister Mei, and others attended. Chairman Wang explained the purpose of his visit in two points and expressed his feelings as follows: "Gentlemen, I met with you in the press here two years ago. I am very happy to see you again today. Some of you I have met before, and some are new faces. Now I have the opportunity to first talk about the purpose of my visit with you. First, because I have not been here for eleven years, I would like to meet with the members of the North China Political Affairs Commission and all of you. Second, because the Xinminhui (New People's Society) will hold a joint conference tomorrow, Chairman Wang Yitang and Vice Chairman Yin Tong sent me a telegram hoping that I could meet with all the representatives. The Joint Conference is very meaningful because the Xinminhui leads the people of North China in practicing the spirit of the New People, uniting as one, promoting comprehensive peace, and completing the Greater East Asia War. I feel that advocating the New People's Movement is also focused on this point. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War on December 8th last year, due to the general mobilization of spirit and various practical needs, especially at the same time as the Xinminhui Joint Conference, I am thinking of discussing the outline of the New People's Movement with you, which is very meaningful. The people who came with me this time are related to the New People's Movement and the East Asia League, such as Mayor Zhou of Nanjing and Director Lin of the Guangdong Education Department, who were among the first to initiate the New People's Movement. At the same time, Minister Lin of the Propaganda Department went to Japan for the New People's Movement and exchanged various opinions with the Japanese government and public for three weeks. This time coming to Beijing is also to participate in the Joint Conference with my brothers, so I feel that the problem of spiritual mobilization just mentioned can be done again, one step further. The purpose of coming to Beiping this time can be seen tomorrow during the conference. Yesterday and today, I saw slogans everywhere, suggesting how to establish security and how to improve people's livelihood. I think establishing security and improving people's livelihood are both closely related to promoting comprehensive peace and completing the Greater East Asia War. Establishing security will stabilize the rear of the Greater East Asia War, which is very important. Improving people's livelihood will enable everyone to be thrifty and work hard to improve their livelihoods. I think the work of establishing security and improving people's livelihood is certainly a fundamental problem, but there is also an important one, which is the improvement of psychology. We know that the National Government has been advocating the issue of peace and anti-communism since the return of the National Government, and has been working hard to promote it every day. Speaking of peace, it is about China and Japan working together as friends. After the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, it further became a situation of sharing joys and sorrows. On December 25th last year, the Anti-Comintern Pact was signed, joining the world's anti-communist front. At the same time, a joint declaration by China, Japan, and Manchuria was issued, further establishing the anti-communist camp in East Asia. But the most important thing is still ideological and factual efforts. The path of anti-communism and peace is being opened up day by day, and the responsibility of the Chinese people is also increasing day by day. At the same time, new responsibilities, new transformations, and all new camps must also be gradually established. The Kuomintang of China is engaged in the East Asia League and the New People's Movement in Nanjing for this purpose. We always want the people of the whole country to work hard in a timely manner, achieve comprehensive peace as soon as possible, and concentrate our efforts to complete the Greater East Asia War. This is the demand of the people of the whole country, and it is also the responsibility of the people of the whole country. The above is the purpose of my visit to Beijing. In addition, I am very pleased and comforted by the cooperation of friendly countries with North China, the efforts of the Political Affairs Commission, and the hard-working attitude of the people of Beijing. I am very happy to have the opportunity to express the purpose of my visit to Beijing to you today."

Stockholm, Sweden, 26th (Havas) – London dispatch. It is generally believed that General Auchinleck, Commander-in-Chief of the British Army in the Middle East, is the most promising candidate for Governor-General of India. Auchinleck previously served as Commander-in-Chief of the British Army in India for many years, and his past experience should help him cope with the current difficult situation. The current Governor-General of India, Lord Linlithgow, will complete his term in March next year. Traditionally, his successor should be appointed six months before the expiration of his term. Other candidates, such as the former Governor of Bombay, Lumley, the Air Minister, Clive, and Minister Webb, Cripps, also have high support.

### Soviet Newspaper Urges Accelerated Industrial Production

Moscow, 25th (Havas) – The Soviet government's official newspaper, Pravda, published an editorial today, urging domestic industries to accelerate production. It stated in brief: "All public and private institutions in the country should strive to economize. The enemy has occupied the coal mines of the Donets Basin and is now beginning to invade our oil fields in the Caucasus. Most of the country's farmland has also fallen into enemy hands. If we do not do our utmost to utilize all the materials we currently have, we will be in danger of defeat. At present, there are already several factories in the country that are working actively to increase production. For example, workers in a leather factory in the Kazan region have learned to save one square inch of leather in each leather jacket they manufacture. This extra leather can be used to make 15,000 leather hats."

### Darlan Declares in Rabat: France Determined to Defend West African Territories; Will Respond Immediately if Coast is Threatened; Naval Strength of Dakar Cannot Be Ignored

Rabat, 26th (Havas) – Before visiting the Sultan of Morocco in Rabat, Admiral Darlan, Commander-in-Chief of the French Forces, told French journalist Fan Lang that France is determined to defend its West African territories and will respond immediately if the West African coast is directly threatened. When Darlan was asked about the situation in Dakar, his facial muscles visibly tightened. He replied that attacking Dakar was a risky move. The French navy stationed there in 1935 is still there today, including the 35,000-ton battleship "Richelieu", the cruiser "Léger", and many other warships, whose strength cannot be ignored. Although Dakar can be attacked from the land, this attack must come from afar and must be carried out during the "dry season". However, the attackers may not be able to make this long march, as they will encounter various obstacles along the way. Although the people of Dakar do not want to imagine the danger of being attacked immediately, they are already prepared. The evacuation of non-essential people from Dakar is only a preventive measure. Once a war breaks out in Dakar, it will become a full-scale war, and everyone must obey Marshal Pétain's orders and swear to shed their last drop of blood.

Vichy, 26th (Havas) – Admiral Darlan has arrived in Casablanca to inspect the defenses of French territories in Africa. French warships anchored in Casablanca include the 35,000-ton giant battleship "Jean Bart", which was still under construction when German troops approached Brest in June 1940. However, it still managed to sail to Casablanca on its own, equipped with heavy artillery. Political circles here today commented on the military importance of Darlan's tour of Africa, saying that he will visit and inspect the defenses of the French coast in North Africa. Before returning home, Darlan also plans to visit Algiers, Blida, and Bizerte.

Situation in Dakar, French West Africa: The picture shows the situation of Dakar harbor. Darlan told reporters in Rabat that if the Allied countries want to attack Dakar, the land attack must be carried out during the "dry season", and the sea is heavily defended by battleships, cruisers, etc., making it difficult to touch. The picture shows the entry of French naval aircraft into the harbor (above) and the steel nets protecting against submarines (below).

### British Planes Attack Italian Cities Again; British Attack French Free Zone; France Protests to Britain

Rome, 26th (Havas) – Yesterday afternoon, the Italian military report claimed that British planes had attacked the Italian cities of Piedmont, Lombardy, Milan, Monchieri, and Novara again on the previous two nights. A fire broke out outside Milan after incendiary bombs were dropped. 48 people were killed and 250 injured. Many people were also killed or injured in Novara. The number of deaths and injuries after the attack on Genoa has now increased to 229, including 39 deaths and 190 injuries. 35 people were killed and 77 injured in Verona after the attack. 3 enemy planes were shot down over Genoa on Friday night. Another Spitfire was shot down over Malta.

Vichy, 25th (Havas) – Regarding the British planes' aggressive act of attacking cities in the French Free Zone, the French government has lodged a strong written protest with the British side through diplomatic channels today, stating that British planes had strafed the French cities of Montluçon and Domérat with machine guns, clearly repeatedly violating the neutrality of Free France. Regarding this matter, the French Information Bureau recently issued a communiqué stating, "Since France signed the armistice agreement, its defense capabilities have decreased, and its combat organization is actually no longer fully effective. Britain has deliberately taken the opportunity to invade our innocent civilians. Such an act is unprecedented in the history of war." In addition, it was learned that the city of Loudun in the French Free Zone was also attacked by British planes last night. The city is very close to the Italian border. British planes dropped several incendiary bombs, and several houses caught fire. Thanks to the brave efforts of the people to extinguish the fire, it was extinguished, and the material losses were minimal.

### Northeast of Tuapse, Germany Occupies Several Mountainous Areas; Intense Fighting on the Don River Front; Soviet Ship Hit in the Gulf of Leningrad

German Headquarters, 8th (Reuters) - This afternoon's German military communiqué stated that the Soviet base southeast of Novorossiysk was subjected to intense bombardment. German mountain troops seized several important mountainous areas northeast of Tuapse. Our aircraft conducted low-altitude attacks on enemy positions. Enemy forces launched counter-attacks along the entire front, but were all repulsed. Another Soviet unit was annihilated. In Stalingrad, German forces destroyed several enemy strongholds and occupied several streets. The situation in the northern part of the city has changed slightly. Soviet forces attempting to relieve the city from the north and south were completely routed. Our aircraft repeatedly bombed enemy artillery positions east of the city, making it difficult for them to fire. German aircraft shot down 27 enemy planes, losing only one. On the Don River front, our forces repelled enemy attempts to cross the river. Both sides engaged in reconnaissance activities in the central and northern sectors. The Soviet battleship "Marat" in the Gulf of Leningrad was hit by several shells and caught fire.

Berlin, 26th (Reuters) - News from here today states that fighting is fierce on the Don River front. Soviet offensives and attempts to cross the river have been repulsed by German and Allied defensive forces. Troops from Romania, Hungary, and Italy participated in this battle. The Soviet offensive on the Don River front aims to relieve German pressure on Stalingrad and force a German retreat from the Stalingrad front. However, this attempt has failed. Spanish volunteers, who have held their position for years, have made great contributions in the Don River area, repeatedly defeating enemy attacks. Recently, 200 Soviet soldiers, under the cover of dense morning fog, occupied part of the Spanish volunteer trenches. A Spanish captain led 18 soldiers in a desperate counter-attack, advancing step by step and eventually driving back the Soviet forces. Afterwards, 60 Soviet corpses were found in the swamp.

Berlin, 26th (Reuters) - The Soviet warship "Marat," which was hit by shells in the Gulf of Leningrad, was launched in 1911 and later refitted. It has a displacement of 23,606 tons and a crew of 1,230. Its armament includes sixteen 30.5 cm guns, six 10.2 cm anti-aircraft guns, eight machine guns, and four torpedo tubes.

Soviet Forces Attack Stalingrad from Two Sides

Berlin, 26th (Havas) - Military news states that yesterday, Red Army forces launched multiple attacks on Stalingrad from the northwest and due south, but were all repulsed, inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy. In the north of the city, the Red Army only used infantry divisions, likely because their motorized units had previously suffered heavy losses. In the south of the city, the Red Army first used artillery bombardment in two locations, then attacked with the support of tanks, but failed to reach German positions.

Stockholm, 26th (Havas) - The latest news from the Eastern Front is that the battle for Stalingrad ended with the capture of the "October Revolution Factory" district. However, the ruined buildings are difficult to defend and remain in Red Army hands. The city's three major industrial districts, namely "Dzerzhinsky," "Red October," and "October Revolution," were captured by German forces on the 15th, 17th, and 25th of this month, respectively. The ruins still held by the Red Army include the workers' residential area in the north of the city and other buildings between the "Red October" and "October Revolution" districts. To the south of the latter district, there is an oil refinery, a lumberyard, and a railway branch station, covering a large area, which is also in Red Army hands. Moscow has not yet confirmed the fall of the October Revolution Factory. The latest Soviet communiqué only mentioned that "two streets" in the factory district had been abandoned. In the northwest of the city, German and Soviet forces continued to fight near the positions occupied by the Red Army on the 23rd of this month. According to reports from German war correspondents, the horrors of hunger and cold are driving civilians out of Stalingrad. Most of the houses have been destroyed and food has run out. Women, children, and the elderly are fleeing in terror. On the Caucasus front, north of Tuapse and southeast of Novorossiysk, German forces have made slight progress and are currently consolidating their positions.

East Bank of the Volga River Bombed

Berlin, 25th (Havas) - According to military sources here, after German forces occupied the "October Revolution Factory," they are now fighting for the factory to the north. Once this objective is achieved, they will attack the headquarters of the political police. Yesterday, aircraft heavily bombed Soviet artillery and anti-aircraft positions on the east bank of the Volga River. The German forces had been using anti-aircraft guns from the factory to bombard the German flanks. By yesterday, these anti-aircraft guns had been destroyed by German dive bombers. Although Soviet aircraft also came to assist, 21 were shot down by German aircraft. In addition, in the northern Caucasus, Soviet forces launched several counter-attacks in an attempt to retake lost positions, but were all repulsed by German forces.

Stockholm, 25th (Havas) - The attention of military observers here is still focused on the Stalingrad city area. Of the 26 strategic strongholds in the area, most have been lost. Only two remain in Red Army hands. The Red Army is still resisting tenaciously, holding these two key points, but their losses are severe and they are in dire straits. It is estimated that the complete German occupation of the Stalingrad city area can be announced within the next day or two. However, because the Red Army has concentrated in the northwest and south of the city, the fighting in the area will not end for some time.

### Gold in Seawater; Concern for Readers of "From Teaching to Imprisonment" Can Be Truly Answered in This Article

Starting from August 18th of this year, this newspaper serialized the article "From Teaching to Imprisonment" by Tie Mingjun. The article, with its twists and turns, was quite popular with readers. Many readers even wrote letters inquiring about the author's current situation, for which we are grateful. However, the general readership is undoubtedly doubtful whether the events in the article are based in fact. The editors have now learned the origins of this article from a friend of the author:

Tie Mingjun studied in France for many years, researching agricultural science and achieving great acclaim. He also had considerable knowledge in physics and chemistry and associated with many well-known figures in the scientific community. They would often gather to chat, sometimes mentioning the extraction of gold from seawater. Some dismissed it as impossible, while others believed it was inevitable. One such figure present at the time was British scientist J.B.N. Haldane, who strongly defended the theory of extracting gold from seawater, and further detailed the entanglements that he faced for working on extracting gold from seawater, that even almost cost him his life, that captivated the group. Tie Mingjun was in attendance, and quickly recorded the key points for future reference.

Several years later, as the clouds of war in Europe grew thicker and a major war seemed inevitable, Tie Mingjun packed his bags and returned to China. Recently, while casually discussing the extraction of gold from seawater with a friend, interest was piqued. Tie Mingjun reorganized the notes of Haldane's account and wrote the article "From Teaching to Imprisonment" in a fictional format. While the article is not necessarily entirely factual, it does have its basis and should not be regarded as pure fabrication. We have now received an article from Geng Yuqing, which provides a thorough discussion of the issue of extracting gold from seawater. We have published it to dispel doubts. - Editor

If the author of "From Teaching to Imprisonment" consistently refuses to admit that his "record" is a fiction, then he is either not very honest or simply a madman; because I can refute his nonsense from a scientific standpoint and prove that the so-called Galvani's alchemy is much the same as the alchemy of the ancient Arabs. Science is not yet fully developed in China, so we must not let it go astray again. Although I must state here that I have no connection with the International Stock Benefit Maintenance Association, and I did not even know there was such an organization in the world before reading the article, because, according to Mr. Tie Ming's meaning, the people of the Maintenance Association "must only hope that readers do not believe his record," which is exactly what I said. Therefore, my words may cause misunderstandings among those who do not know me. I can frankly tell everyone that last semester I was still a third-year student in the Department of Chemistry at Jiaotong University, and my father is a poor wretch who has left Shanghai to make a living.

Everyone knows that Hindenburg was Germany's foremost politician and soldier in the last World War. As for scientists, that would be chemist Haber (F. Haber). Not only did he complete the famous Haber-Bosch process for synthesizing ammonia from air to produce explosives during the war, so that German soldiers did not feel the lack of gunpowder, but he also made significant contributions to poison gas warfare. He exerted his greatest efforts in the laboratory for the welfare of his country. When the Treaty of Versailles was concluded, Germany was identified as the instigator of the war, bearing the full responsibility for the European war, ceding territory and paying reparations, suffering losses everywhere; so that the country's vitality was greatly damaged, industries were suspended, the economy was extremely strained, and the people's livelihoods were difficult, on the verge of despair. Haber, this defeated general, took office as president, shouldering the political task of reviving Germany, just as he had entered the laboratory and worked hard to explore gold, trying to find a way to repay the country's national debt of 132 billion gold marks. He wanted to extract gold from seawater and buried himself in hard work for ten years before Galvani and Leconte. Haber collected water samples from extremely distant and sea surfaces such as the mouth of the Rhine River, the North Sea, the North Atlantic, San Francisco Bay, and the South Pacific, and tested water samples at different seasons and depths. As a result, although he became the most outstanding person engaged in this work, his goal ultimately could not be achieved. His achievement was the shattering of the dream of extracting gold from seawater.

Generally speaking, the gold contained in seawater includes the following types: (1) auric and aurous ions, (2) colloidal gold particles, (3) gold contained in mineral particles, (4) gold contained in organic matter in seawater. As for the extraction methods, over the centuries, nearly 50 types have been registered with various governments, now summarized as follows:

(1) Filter seawater with charcoal, then wash the charcoal with potassium cyanide (KCN) solution, and finally precipitate the gold by zinc or electrolysis.

(2) Reduce gold ions in seawater with sulfur dioxide, hydrogen sulfide, etc., and then filter.

(3) Stir mercury in seawater to collect gold.

(4) Absorb gold with copper powder, iron oxide or iron hydroxide, or various semi-colloidal organic matter before filtration.

(5) Dissolve copper or lead salts in seawater, then add hydrogen sulfide or sodium sulfide to produce finely divided copper or lead sulfide. These finely divided precipitates can adsorb gold. Finally, the gold can still be separated from the seawater by filtration or centrifugation.

(6) Reduce and absorb gold ions with powdered sulfur plus acid.

(7) Electrolyze seawater with a low potential difference current (preferably with a high-speed rotating anode).

Seawater is inexhaustible and readily available. Now that there are extraction methods, whether the theory of using it to generate wealth is sound or not, it is always a tempting topic; so naturally some quacks have risen to promote it, and many good people have been fooled. In the past, companies engaged in the business of extracting gold from seawater once flourished, but after the quacks had made enough money, these companies all closed down. Because among all the extraction methods, there is not one that can make the extracted gold more valuable than the cost of extraction. In fact, whether many scientific inventions can be applied to industry depends entirely on the question of whether it is cost-effective, not whether it is possible. For example, even today we cannot buy domestically produced vacuum tubes or films on the market, which does not mean that Chinese scientists cannot manufacture them today, but because various industries have not yet developed, if they are made by force, the cost will be more expensive than foreign goods, which is very uneconomical. If we continue to think about extracting gold from seawater in a straightforward manner, then why not extract iridium, platinum, and palladium, which are all much more expensive than gold! It would even become profitable to extract protein from the urine of diabetic patients and enzymes from the saliva of children, which would be ridiculous. Therefore, sensible scientists will carefully consider all aspects before engaging in a new industry. Regarding the question of extracting gold from seawater, the first thing worth considering is, of course, how much gold is contained in seawater. According to Jaenicke in an article published in Naturwissenschaften, there is indeed a lot, about hundreds of times the total amount of gold mines mined since the beginning of human history. But unfortunately, the ocean is too large and too deep, and only less than 0.02 milligrams (mg.) of gold dust is contained in 40 liters of seawater, in other words, the ratio of other substances in seawater to gold is about 200 million to one. Martin told Mr. Tie that "there is gold in seawater, that is what you know, about one in 20 million," I don't know what is the basis. Probably the seawater on Earth will never have such a high gold content. Now let's translate the following passage from Jaenicke's paper describing Haber's measurement of the gold content of seawater:

"The more satisfactory the improvement of the analytical methods, the more profound the disappointment of people with the main problem; because it seems that every step forward in overcoming the difficult work, the gold content obtained in the bottle test is reduced by one step. In the years of testing, the gold content of each liter of seawater fell from milligrams to tenths of milligrams, hundredths of milligrams, and finally thousandths of milligrams. It no longer fell from here. Probably there will be no change in the future. It shows that the high values obtained in the initial work are incorrect. These high values seem to be short-lived and come from the introduction of gold into the cupel and reagent used in the test."

Before Haber, the results of the measurements by Mr. Svante Arrhenius and Chr. A. Munster were 5 to 6 milligrams of gold per metric ton of seawater (approximately equal to 0.98421 long tons or 1.0231 short tons). Mr. J.R. Dan's results are 4 to 5 milligrams. The results published by other gentlemen such as L. Wagoner, J.W. Pack, and E. Sandstadt are all above 10 milligrams. However, facts prove that these numbers are all incorrect. According to a recent report by Mr. Wm. E. Caldwell of Oregon State College in the United States, the water along the coast of Oregon contains only one-tenth to two-tenths of a milligram of gold particles per metric ton, which shows that even if all the gold in one ton of seawater is extracted with gold solvent, it is only worth one ten-thousandth of a U.S. dollar, which is not cost-effective anyway.

I saw in the science news column of Time that Canadians plant a kind of "horse-tail Weed (Equisetum Arnense)" to absorb the scattered gold underground, and then burn the grass into ashes and extract it, which is quite effective. If Mr. Tie wants to contact comrades and confront the maintenance association, I think it is more realistic to put down the formula of gold solvent and go to Canada to study horse-tail grass.

### City's Cooking Oil Supply is Sufficient; Ration Gradually Increases; Controlled Rationing Distributed on Schedule; Large-Volume Users Rationed by Wholesale Outlets

Recently, citizens have often felt the hardship of not being able to buy cooking oil even with money, and worry about the possibility of oil running out. However, according to an investigation by this newspaper's reporter yesterday from the responsible parties in the oil industry, the reason why the sales volume of each oil shop this month is relatively small is because the amount of rations given last month was reduced. The offices in charge of regulating the supply of cooking oil to the people and the wholesale outlets of the cooking oil industry usually allow each registered oil retail store to store enough cooking oil for one week of sales. However, the total amount of cooking oil rations for the city was reduced by 15,000 dans (a unit of weight) after review by the highest authorities in charge of control, so that the oil stored in each store was in danger of being sold out. The amount of rations for this month has been increased, and from the beginning of the month to the 26th, 18,000 dans have been distributed. It is estimated that the amount can exceed 20,000 dans by the end of the month. The amount of rations for next month will not be reduced. If this can continue for a long time, the supply of oil to retail stores can be brought back to normal.

Cooking Oil Supply is Centrally Controlled

The supply of cooking oil in the city is generally controlled and distributed by a central organization. The monthly ration amount and its regulations: At present, there are a total of 2,200 registered cooking oil retail stores in the two concessions, Hongkou, Nantao, Zhabei, and Pudong districts, which regularly receive oil from the branch wholesale outlets directly under the wholesale outlets of the cooking oil industry. There are a total of ten such branch wholesale outlets, located in larger oil shops or oil factories. The amount of oil that retail stores are allowed to receive and the interval between oil receiving dates (such as receiving oil every day, every three days, or every five days, etc.) are specified by the wholesale outlets on the oil receiving vouchers of each store and rationed on schedule. For restaurants, cafeterias, hotels, etc., which need a larger amount of cooking oil, the same industry wholesale outlets, after approval of their application, issue oil purchase certificates, and go to the nearest branch wholesale outlet every day or every few days to purchase the specified amount of cooking oil.

Factory Output is Sufficient to Meet Needs

It is said that there is no need to worry about the city's cooking oil supply running out. There are three reasons for this: (1) Inventory is sufficient. Although the exact amount is not disclosed by the highest material control authorities, it seems that there is no doubt that the inventory is sufficient to meet the needs of a considerable period of time. (2) Factory output is abundant. The amount of cooking oil produced in this port is more than 1,000 dans per day, which is enough to meet local needs with a surplus. Although sometimes the raw material soybeans cannot be shipped to Shanghai due to the lack of ships, and the oil factories may sometimes stop and continue, with the supplement of inventory, the supply can still be maintained. Recently, more than 100,000 dans of soybeans have been shipped from Liaodong to Shanghai. If the source of raw materials is continuous, the factory output can be greatly increased. (3) The oil produced in the surrounding rural areas can be self-sufficient. For example, in the Pudong rural area and the Fahua area in western Shanghai, and even in the smallest towns, there are several oil factories, and the output can not only be self-sufficient, but also sold to Shanghai. This is different from the supply of sugar in the surrounding rural areas, which must rely on the city.

Crack Down on Profiteering in the Oil Trade

The recent reduction in the amount of oil sold by retail oil stores is due to the insufficient amount of rations given last month, but there are also retailers who intentionally hoard and do not sell, which is close to hoarding and trying to profiteer. The occurrence of this phenomenon may be due to private buying and selling between peers. Only 2,200 registered oil stores can normally receive oil for sale, and there must be many unregistered oil stores that must obtain cooking oil for sale in other ways. Therefore, private buying and selling between peers affects the normality of registered oil stores selling cooking oil. Underground transactions may not be avoided. The reporter asked the relevant responsible persons about the possibility of speculation in oil stores. It is said that the oil industry office and the wholesale outlets pay close attention to this kind of thing. If any registered oil store has illegal behavior that affects the oil supply and is found to be true, its registration qualification will be cancelled and the ration will be stopped.

### Charity Bazaar Dance Party; Deadline for Collecting Prizes

The charity bazaar dance party "Chinese Night" was held the day before yesterday, which has been recorded in this newspaper. On that day, Wu Suzhi sang "Five Flower Caves" from the Four Great Dan's, and also added "Er Jin Gong", and Yu Zhenfei changed to sing "Bai Men Lou", which was very popular. Ms. Bai Guang sang, and many people requested songs. Ms. Zhao Wenyi and Mrs. Li Zuyu performed a zither solo, singing and dancing, with natural postures. The flower-selling ladies were Misses Pan Qi, Wang Yulu, Xia Danwei, Situ Weiwei, Situ Qiqi, and Yao Jingyi. They were beautifully decorated, lively and lovely. The conference is very grateful to all the merchants, factories and individuals who donated items for the charity sale. The remaining items will still be sold for charity expenses. The prize-winning lottery tickets sold by the conference have also been drawn in public. The first to fourth lottery tickets are 10 yuan per number, and the fifth lottery ticket, which was originally scheduled to be drawn on the 24th, but was changed to the 25th for the final draw, is 20 yuan per number. The prizes are rich and unprecedented, including famous people's calligraphy and paintings, cameras, cosmetics, etc., all of which are valuable items. It is said that there are still many prizes that have not been claimed. For detailed numbers, see today's opposite advertisement, and you can claim the prize within ten days, that is, before the 6th of next month, at the Wanguo Sports Association office at 304 Ma Huo Road. Unclaimed prizes will be handed over to the association for charity.

### Chinese Evacuee Association to End Next Month; Return Home Certificates to Be Handled by Military Department

The Shanghai Municipal Council's Chinese Evacuee Committee, since its establishment upon the decision of the SMC Board of Directors in February of this year, has swiftly reached nine months. During this period, with the assistance of Chinese directors Yuan Deng, Xu Jianping, and Zhang Qin, and the planning of Chinese committee member and director Chen Junhong, it has achieved considerable success. According to a report from the Datong News Agency, the committee is scheduled to formally end on November 1st. Director Chen Junhong stated that, over the past nine months, more than 30 hometown associations, travel agencies, and other organizations have applied to the committee for the issuance of return home certificates, totaling 150,000 certificates issued. Other contributions, such as the distribution of half-price discount coupons, the issuance of passes, the organization of disaster relief work, and the promotion of group returns to their hometowns, have also greatly contributed to the work of evacuating the population of this city. However, with the gradual completion of the issuance of citizen certificates, the evacuation work seems to be slowing down. Therefore, the SMC issued a document on October 8th to abolish nine return home certificate offices and decided that the Chinese Evacuee Committee will also formally end on November 1st. It is reported that citizens who need return home certificates in the future can directly contact the Shanghai Japanese Army Department at 1147 Dithswell Road.

### Subletting Housing Licenses Still Being Issued

The Shanghai Municipal Council is continuing to issue subletting housing licenses, but the number of people obtaining licenses has clearly decreased. If second landlords were supposed to start obtaining licenses from July 1st, but many held back to see what would happen. Therefore, in addition to paying the license fee of 18 yuan, the licensing office also requires an overdue fee of 15 yuan, totaling 32 yuan. At the same time, personnel have been dispatched to conduct investigations in the central, western, northeastern and other districts. If any second landlords have delayed obtaining licenses, lawsuits will be filed with the court, and they will be sentenced to three to ten days of detention. After release, they must still go to the SMC tax collection department to obtain a license.

### Japanese Consulate to Establish a Court to Hear Cases of Enemy Nationals, Limited to Those with Consular Jurisdiction

Masaki, the chief translator of the Japanese Consulate General in Shanghai, told reporters yesterday that the Japanese authorities will soon establish a special consular court to hear cases involving enemy nationals with consular jurisdiction. Legal professionals have commented on this matter, saying that for a long time in the past, there has been much debate and no clear guidance on whether enemy nationals with consular jurisdiction should be tried when they commit crimes. Now that a special consular court is about to be established, this chaotic situation in Shanghai can be clarified. The organization of the court and the selection of judges and staff are still under consideration. As for enemy nationals without consular jurisdiction, their cases will be heard by Chinese courts.

### Sugar Distribution Completed; Public Sales Began Yesterday; Authorities Strictly Prohibit Taking the Opportunity to Raise Sugar Prices

The English-language "The Shanghai Times" reports that, according to an official from the Sugar Merchants Cooperative Business Office and confirmed by several distributors yesterday, the sugar distribution for this month has been fully completed.

Continuous Investigation of Illegal Activities

Starting this morning (26th), shops in the two concessions can sell sugar at the fixed price of 3.30 yuan per pound. However, the amount each person is allowed to purchase was not decided as of yesterday afternoon. Some suggested limiting each person to one pound, while others said half a pound, to prevent hoarding. At the same time, the Sugar Merchants Cooperative Business Office is continuing to strictly investigate the activities of illegal merchants, as they have discovered that these merchants have taken advantage of the sugar shortage to raise the prices of refined and cube sugar.

Complete Control of Sugar Distribution

According to investigations, some stores had raised the price of refined sugar to five or six yuan per pound last week, and it was not even the best quality. Locally made 14-liang (approximately 1.1 pounds) cube sugar was also being sold for 5.50 yuan. Officials stated that the distribution of sugar in Shanghai is now under control. If the public can cooperate and not purchase more than they need, there should be no shortage in the near future.

Business Office Notice Urging Delivery

Furthermore, a Datong News Agency reporter has learned that the Shanghai Sugar Merchants Cooperative Business Office has issued a notice stating that Taikoo sugar that has been allocated can now be delivered. Retailers should present the sugar company's receipt to exchange for a delivery permit. The procedures for the delivery of Taikoo sugar that was previously allocated have now been completed. Retailers are requested to submit their sugar company receipts to this office within two days, the 26th and 27th of this month, to obtain a delivery permit and pick up the sugar from the designated sugar company. Please do not delay. This is a special announcement.

### Merchant Wrongly Accused of Theft; Witnesses Summoned for Retrial; Bail Denied for Police Officers

Liu Ziming, a Ningbo native residing at 8 Beile Road, Daodeli, French Concession, and Chen Liechang, the owner of Chengtai Wood Shop on Avenue Edward VII, were previously arrested after being falsely accused of being members of a gang of thieves by French police officers Zhu Jutong and others because their bribery attempts failed. They have been interrogated repeatedly, and the details have been reported in previous newspapers. The case was heard again yesterday. However, the robber Zhou Qidang still insisted that when they committed the robbery, it was Gao Xiaosan, who is at large, who invited Liu and Chen to rob No. 80 Avenue Dubail. When questioned, Liu Ziming said that on September 1st, police officers Zhu Jutong, Chen Rongtang, and Xu Kaixing came to his house and falsely accused him of being associated with robbers, demanding a bribe of 20,000 foreign dollars to settle the matter, or else he would be arrested. Therefore, he panicked and paid the money at his uncle's house on Avenue Dubail the next day. He also asked Chen Liechang to report to the Japanese Military Police, who sent officers to wait at his uncle's house the next day. When Officer Zhu came to collect the money, he was detained, which proves that they are legitimate businessmen and would not dare to be robbers. He asked for a clear investigation. Chen Liechang's testimony was the same. The court ordered Chen Liechang to remain on his original bail, and Liu Ziming to post a shop guarantee of 20,000 yuan, and adjourned the hearing to summon witnesses for further verification.

Bail Denied for Police Officers Extorting Money

Also, French police officers Xu Kaixing, Zhu Jutong, and Chen Rongtang, were reported to the French police by Liu Ziming, a suspect in the robbery of Tu Yongtai's woolen goods store at 80 Avenue Dubail, for conspiring to extort a bribe from him. They were detained and sent to court to be prosecuted for extortion. They have been questioned repeatedly, and the hearing has been adjourned. Yesterday, the case was heard again. Xu, Zhu, and Chen still denied the extortion charges and requested bail. The court denied their request and ordered them to remain in custody, and adjourned the hearing to summon witnesses for further questioning.

### Strict Price Controls by Authorities Spell Doom for Western Pharmacies; Some Items Certainly Unprofitable

The golden age of Western drug stores was created by manipulating prices and hoarding goods. Now that the authorities have announced price controls on all goods, Western drug stores can no longer use their tricks. In the past, every autumn, the prices of tonics would skyrocket, but now price increase announcements have been replaced by discount advertisements. This shows the dire straits of Western drug stores. Recently, the unprecedented price cuts by famous pharmacies such as Union Dispensary, Sincere, Sun Sun, The Sun, China-America Pharmacy, Grand Drug Store, Weiji Pharmacy, and Jihua Tang for the famous tonic "Tiger Turtle Bear Deer" are most commendable. "Tiger Turtle Bear Deer," which used to sell for eight yuan per box, now only sells for five yuan. Based on the past reputation of "Tiger Turtle Bear Deer" and the public's trust in it, it is effective in treating neurasthenia, impotence, premature ejaculation, and other conditions. The medical community has praised it, and the cost is definitely higher than the selling price, making it certainly unprofitable. Therefore, the deadline is set for yesterday. Those who directly call the company at 92913 today can still get it at the discounted price. At the same time, pharmacies in other cities are also offering the discount of five yuan per box to compete.

### Matters Concerning the Issuance of Bread Certificates Handled by the Rice Management Committee; After December, No Bread Available for Purchase After 5 PM Daily Without a Bread Certificate

Yesterday morning (26th), inquiries at the Shanghai Municipal Council's Rice and Flour Office revealed that the purchase of bread certificates, which was previously handled by bakeries, has now changed. From now on, bread certificates required by registered Chinese bread consumers living in the French Concession will be issued by the Price Evaluation Committee of the Food Administration Office at 2 Fulvli Road. Certificates required by these consumers living outside the French Concession will be issued by the SMC office. The addresses and jurisdictions of these offices are the same as the offices issuing rice purchase certificates. As for areas outside the concessions, bread certificates can be collected at the Shanghai Race Club, 423 Route Mercier.

Certificate Issuance Dates Have Been Set

Certificates for December of this year and January of next year will be issued from November 16th to November 27th of this year. Bread certificates cannot be purchased without the citizen certificate of the head of the household. Registered bread consumers who wish to obtain certificates should apply to the issuing office in their jurisdiction within the above dates. Late registrations will be canceled. All issuing offices will be closed on Saturdays, Sundays, and public holidays. The daily office hours are from 9:00 AM to noon and from 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM. After this, if you want to switch to another bakery to purchase bread, you can only do so when the certificate is issued.

December Restrictions on Retail Sales

Furthermore, starting on December 1st of this year, bakeries or their retail outlets must not sell bread on any date without a bread certificate coupon. After 5:00 PM daily, any remaining unsold bread may be sold to people without coupons. Bread certificate coupons are only valid on the date printed on the coupon. Consumers should only hand over the coupon to the bakery and/or its retail outlet when purchasing the amount of bread indicated on the coupon. If coupons are handed over to the bakery and/or its retail outlet in advance, they will be considered invalid and will not be replaced.

### New Ning Shao Steamer to Arrive in Shanghai Today

Haitong Steamer Applies to Resume Sailing

The new Ning Shao steamer is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai today and depart for Ningbo tomorrow (28th). The company's Mingshang Maru departed for Ningbo yesterday with a very crowded passenger load, selling over 400 tickets. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Wanji steamer departed for Ningbo yesterday, and the Wansheng steamer is scheduled to depart for Ningbo today. The Haitong steamer, which used to travel between Shanghai and Ningbo, has been suspended for a long time. The company has applied to the authorities to resume sailing, but there is still no confirmed news of resumption. The company's office address, formerly on the Bund, above the Bank of Communications on Wuma Road, has now moved to 5 Rue du Consulat.

### Fire Drill Held in Avenue Joffre District

The 84th Li-Bao of the Avenue Joffre district of the French Concession held a formal large-scale fire drill at 3:30 PM yesterday. The assembly point was the Li-Bao General Office on Route Magy. It was also reported that the designated doctors and nurses in the district were also dispatched.

### Stealing Checks and Seals to Fraudulently Withdraw Cash

Qian Jizhuo, a 24-year-old Jiangxi native, was employed as a clerk at the Zhongyi Company at 280 Beijing Road. Recently, Qian secretly stole two blank checks from his colleague Yu Boyu, from Wing On Bank and The American Express Bank, along with Yu's seal. He filled in the amounts, affixed the seal, and withdrew 2,000 yuan from Wing On Bank and 5,000 yuan from The American Express Bank, spending the money as he pleased. The case was discovered by Yu, who reported it to the General Inspectorate. Chinese detectives Zhu Wanjun and Yao Bingsong were dispatched to arrest Qian Jizhuo, and 5,780 yuan in cash was recovered. The remaining 1,220 yuan was missing. He was taken to the police station for further investigation.

### The Art of "Begging on the Ground"

"Begging on the ground" is one type of begging method. It is not known who created this method, but it is practiced by people because of the work-free element. It is very popular in Shanghai and almost everywhere. Just looking at Rue Chapsal, the sidewalks on both sides, counting not two thousand yards, but there are as many as forty-three people begging on the ground. The reporter observed each one and felt that everyone can "beg on the ground"; there is a skill that is not a skill. Let's summarize it, which can be roughly divided into seven types.

Sacrifice for the Country

Those begging on the ground are sitting or standing, with very sagging skin, like an old monk in meditation. The petition paper is spread on the ground, with stones used to hold down the four corners. What is written on it is nothing more than the homeland being ravaged by the flames of war, the family being destroyed, wives and children being separated, hoping that benevolent gentlemen will open their purses to provide emergency assistance, and they will not be able to repay them in this life. This is the most common, and the wording is mostly the same, so it does not arouse the sympathy of passersby, so the income is generally not good.

Overwhelmed by Poverty and Sickness

The protagonist is mostly a middle-aged woman, with an old man with snow-white beard lying next to her, looking sick. If a passerby glances over, the woman will say, "The patient is her father-in-law – excuse me, a filial daughter-in-law – what disease? – I can't afford to see a doctor." As she speaks, the old man pants more severely, and the woman supports him with tears in her eyes, patting his back. Seeing this scene, many people are moved to open their purses.

Prince in Distress

On the empty space next to Café Lorette, there is a young man begging on the ground. Although his clothes are tattered, his teeth are white and his lips are red. He has an impressive appearance. In front of him is spread a secondary school diploma, and next to it is a stack of Western-style books. He said that he is from Guangxi and used to study at a certain middle school in Shanghai. Due to the war, family support was interrupted. It is a small matter to drop out of school, but it is really impossible to bear hunger and cold. In the past, when a young master fell into distress, there were often wealthy people who helped him and often earned a beautiful wife as a result. It is now difficult to find such an encounter. A reporter glanced at the diploma and saw only a few角 tickets in the center.

The Whole Family Kneeling

The whole family is dispatched, young and old gathered together, with three generations including five to ten people, all kneeling next to a petition on the ground. The men kowtow repeatedly, and the women and children sob softly. The wording on the petition says that they are seeking relatives and were not found, and they are in dire straits, hoping to raise some travel expenses to return home. The reporter faintly heard someone pointing out that these are the same, a union of their peers.

Thrilling

Zhao Erniang eating sugar is admired by all ages. What is being performed here is an old woman from Jiangbei who is eating and crying. She bends down and chews the bark from the plane tree roots, swallowing it whole. A noble lady walks by, sees it, and exclaims, "How sinful! How sinful!" She throws down more than ten soda crackers and a five-yuan note. This scene is not particularly stimulating. Later, at the intersection of Rue Chapsal and Rue de la Course, I saw a scene where a beggar used an iron needle to pierce his nasal cavity, causing it to bleed profusely. Then, he dipped a pen in the blood and wrote a bright red "Hungry" character on the ground! Onlookers could not help but feel sad and donated generously, filling the bowl in ten minutes with more than fifty yuan. The reporter later told a friend about this, who said that this is a gang from Jianghu, and the blood shed is actually Sapanwood juice. This is quite cruel, but whether it is true or false, the expression at the time was truly thrilling!

Talent Unappreciated

A relatively elegant type is where they show off their talents in the writing on the petition. They have indeed read some books in the past. The writing is quite elegant, the wording is quite smooth, and some even attach a quatrain or octet, reminiscing about the past and feeling sorry for themselves. Some well-dressed passersby cannot help but be aroused by the thought of pitying talent. In addition to donating money, one person who seems to be enthusiastic asks the beggar in detail about his past and copies his resume and address before leaving. The reporter secretly thinks that there might be a scene of Xiao He chasing Han Xin under the moon.

Genius Prodigy

When young children beg on the ground, it is mostly someone behind the scenes directing them, and this business requires some education. I once saw a six-year-old child use chalk to draw a scene from the battle in Burning of the Red Lotus Temple, several feet wide and detailed. Another place had a girl, also about seven years old, lying on the ground in public writing a petition in English, the content of which was between sense and nonsense, but the handwriting was like dragons and snakes. Next to it was a line in Chinese: "Father died, mother is sick, the child is hungry." The girl's demeanor was lively and did not seem to be suffering from hunger. Passersby mostly looked at her with curious eyes and rarely donated money. (Qin Meng)

### Robbery and Murder Case from Last Spring Found to Be Conceived by the Pawnbroker's Cousin

The Chenghai pawnshop owned by Wu Huaiqing, a Pudong native, located at 386 Rue Paul Beau, at the intersection with Rue Beile, French Concession, was robbed on the evening of March 26 last year at around 10 PM, just as it was closing. Five robbers, each holding a handgun, entered the shop and ordered everyone to remain silent. They drove the shop employees Huang Shizhang, Chuan Mengyuan, and Zhang Xingsheng into the kitchen, tied them up with ropes, stuffed their mouths with cotton, and covered their heads with cotton blankets. They then went upstairs and robbed valuables worth more than 8,300 yuan. Before leaving, they suddenly fired more than ten shots, killing employees Huang and Chuan and seriously injuring Zhang Xingsheng. The robbers then fled with their loot. The police were notified and sent detectives to the scene to investigate. Detectives Yao Zhupo, Jiang Zhongjia, Xia Changgen, and others from the French police have learned that the robbers Zhu Jincai and Gu Hanchu were arrested and sentenced to 15 years in prison for committing theft in the International Settlement. During the investigation, they confessed to being involved in the robbery and murder case at Chenghai Pawnshop. Therefore, Zhu and Gu were brought to the French police station for questioning. Zhu and Gu confessed that they were involved in the robbery and that the plan was conceived by Wu Sanlin, the shop owner's cousin, who invited them and the fugitives Ling Hechu, Chen Yulin, and others to commit the robbery. Wu Sanlin knew the shop employees and feared that they would leak the information. In order to silence them, he ordered the robbers to fire shots and kill the shop employees. It is currently unknown where Wu Sanlin, Ling Hechu, and others have fled. The suspects have been ordered to be detained pending investigation.

### One Sampan Sinks in the Strong Winds the Other Day

Due to the sudden change in weather the other day, the strong winds on the Huangpu River were rare since the beginning of autumn. As a result, some ships suspended operations.

### Large Investors Sell Category D Bonds, Leading to Unique Drop

The public bond gray market was very strong yesterday. After positive news, large investors rushed to sell, completely wiping out any gains and causing the market price to fall slightly. It was found that most of the sellers this time were trading in Category D and C bonds. Category D bonds were affected by this, while Category C bonds maintained their price due to strong buying interest from yarn and flower businesses. Despite the large number of bonds being sold, the market is still expected to perform well. This unexpected sell-off was unpredictable. Although a large number of bonds were sold yesterday, the market price only dropped by a small amount, about two jiao in most cases and one yuan in a few cases, which shows the enthusiasm of buyers. Category C bonds initially traded at sixty-six yuan, a gain of more than ten yuan. The high price was seen at six yuan and one jiao, and then gradually declined. The lowest price was seen at four jiao and six fen. Category D bonds were sold off more, so the price was also cheaper. The future may still see a high face first, and then decline again. The final result was a uniform decline of two jiao to one yuan and one jiao. The total transaction volume was approximately 3.56 million yuan. A brief summary table is listed below.

### Chinese Stocks Show Mixed Performance, World Bookstore Attracts Enthusiastic Buyers

Business transactions were thin, down two and a half yuan. China Merchants stock showed little change. In the department store industry, China National Goods remained flat at around 120 yuan. Yong'an and Xinxin each fell by a small amount within one yuan. Nei Lianyi suddenly fell by seven jiao. In the textile industry, Yong'an Textile fell by a small amount of twenty yuan, and Meilun velvet fell by five jiao. This was a small correction after several days of excessive gains. Hongxing, Da Zhonghua Weaving, and Fuchang Dyeing and Weaving were similar to their prices at the end of last week. Gongxin Electric received registration certificate No. 70 from the Ministry of Industry. Under the buying wind, it saw a transaction at fifteen and a half yuan yesterday, a rise of seven jiao and a half. China Merchants stock suddenly saw selling activity, falling by a small amount of one yuan. Zhabei Water and Electricity remained flat.

The 16-pound coarse cloth token was even more scarce. Datong Feihong spot goods were 202 yuan, and the factory offered 205 yuan with buyers. The 16-pound Earth brand was also asking for 209 yuan. Light weights were more stable. The 9-pound Xinyu was 113 yuan, and the 8-pound Zhenzhong had sellers at 110 yuan. The 12-ball fine cloth was 171 yuan and 5 jiao.

For colored cloth, Taohua Woman's Forest was 254 yuan and 7 jiao and a half in the morning, and the highest sale in the afternoon was 257 yuan, later falling to around 256 yuan. Poplin was gradually being activated. Changshou was six yuan, and Wanbenli was five yuan and eight jiao, still with demand exceeding supply.

Eastern Cloth The natural color fine cloth continued to be firm due to the appetite of experts. The 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth Xinxin order closing call price was 179 yuan to 80 yuan. The Dragon Head bank order was 170 yuan and 5 jiao, Caiqiu was 169 yuan and 7 jiao and a half, Flying Fish was 167 yuan and 5 jiao, and Yanghe was 166 yuan and 5 jiao, all up five jiao to one yuan. Only the Four Gentlemen flannel red order, due to supply exceeding demand, gradually went downstream. The closing price was 7 yuan and 8 fen, while the bank order flannel actually rose, with buyers wanting it at 7 yuan and 45 fen.

The interest rate for the Money Industry Association's interbank lending remained at one jiao and four fen.

### Soybean Sales Are Very Strong

There were recently some scattered individual traders transporting soybeans, and yesterday, due to increased supply, transactions were slightly more active.

Although soybean cake transactions were not smooth, the market was stable. Yesterday, 1,000 pieces of Kai Changji soybean cake were sold at a price of 70 yuan, and a carload of Feizi soybean cake was sold at a price of 71 yuan.

### Commercial Briefs

New Taorou Song But Tight Again Because the allocation of capital is slightly loose, the number of plates once dropped to 1,200 yuan, but the recent stomach is very strong, and the asking price is tight, and yesterday it rose to 1,300 yuan, a return of 100 yuan.

Chen Xinghua Yuan Jia Cheaper Recently there have been continued arrivals, because new goods are expensive, the price is not weak, and yesterday there was a batch of exports, which is about 60% of the price of new goods, because there are moldy particles mixed in and not all clear good goods, so the price is cheaper, and there are also those who have been oversubscribed, and the asking price is outrageous, and no disc has been formed.

Forsythia Raises The market has opened at 700 yuan before, because the number of existing ones is gradually decreasing, and the cost is high, so the price is tightening, and the current market is called 800 yuan.

The Cigarette Market Is Calm Cigarettes are calm and quiet because it is said that the distribution of goods is imminent, and the parity goods are strictly checked, so the supply and demand are quiet. The price of Great Britain is 9,100 yuan, Old Knife 8,000 yuan, Pinhai 7,750 yuan, Wuhua 7,000 yuan, Fairy 7,000 yuan, Japanese cigarette gold gun 3,100 yuan, Gold Building 3,350 yuan, Red Rose 2,600 yuan, Quanlu 1,250 yuan, 20 branches 3,000 yuan, Guide 2,800 yuan and 50 yuan, National cigarettes Yu Zita 5,800 yuan, Beauty 5,200 yuan, Golden Mouse 1,800 yuan, Platinum Dragon 3,500 yuan, Golden Dragon 3,200 yuan, Da Lianzhu 3,200 yuan, the selling price is more or less the same as last week, and the rise and fall are mixed. It is difficult for woolen cloth to enter and exit. Recently, the business of woolen cloth merchants has felt difficult. The existing goods of foreign companies have long been sold out, and the raw materials of manufacturers are expensive and difficult to obtain. The cost exceeds the market price, and the houses are full of strength. All purchases feel that the market is not light, the colors are mostly old, and the sales are often extremely weak, with heavy capital and little profit, and even Western-style tailoring gangs are not able to do so.

Spring and Autumn

### Coming from the Fields

— Yi Ran

Yesterday I went to the countryside and felt that the grass in Jiangnan did not wither at the end of autumn. I talked to an old farmer for a while. They simply did not know the Qin and Han dynasties, and were content with their fields. Looking back, we are busy every day in the foreign market for ten miles. I don't know what to do!

Their unscientific invention is that cow dung can be used as fuel, which is half as economical as the coal briquettes that are not easy to get today, but they don't claim to be some kind of scientific fuel to seek a good price and sell it. Isn't this ironclad proof that they are not good at business? However, they are content with their little utopia and do not regret it.

In the vegetable garden, I stroked the growing Chinese cabbage. I ate Chinese cabbage noodles, which tasted better than in any restaurant. But when I thought of my desolate hometown and the fields were about to become desolate, I couldn't help but feel the emotion of why not return to the fields.

Present expenses are always a torment to mankind. We envy the idleness of the old farmers, and we also lament that poetry and books have misled me. However, the end of the road is still not when we enter the mountains, we must go deep into the forests, and we must be secretive!

What we should extract today is the old farmers' indifference and sweetness, not the old farmers' leisurely contentment.

### True Happiness

— Ah Hui

Everyone lives in the world, and everyone needs to find happiness; but what is true happiness?

It is not easy to answer this question, because each has different opinions, and each has a different outlook on life. Now, let's divide it into three types of people.

The first type of people build their happiness in the realm of imagination. They assume that if they do no bad deeds in their lives, even if they live in poverty, or are slightly bullied and oppressed, they can always ascend to heaven after death. This illusory idea allows them to quietly spend their lives with the essence of tolerance, and makes them yearn for true happiness.

The second type of people regard material enjoyment as their true happiness. For the sake of money, they will do despicable and shameless things that obliterate the welfare of the people. They build their own happiness on the pain of others and use money to satisfy their desires. Many people have lost their conscience, their personality, and ruined their lives in this way. What they seek is only superficial luxury and prosperity. In reality, they have become a gilded clay statue without a soul, only a shell.

The third type of people's happiness, which is also true happiness, their happiness starts from the happiness of many people, and they seek their own common happiness, and individual happiness does not hinder the happiness of others; on the contrary, individual happiness is also for seeking the happiness of more people. To give a simple example, the woman described in the movie story "Mother's Heart" built her happiness on her own struggle, in order to achieve a reasonable ideal - a group of innocent and lively children can grow up in a healthy cultivation, support, and education. These people forget themselves in the happiness they need to find. They dissolve the happiness of the individual in the majority, and they also find their true happiness in the middle.

Everyone should find their own happiness. This happiness is not illusory, nor does it hinder or deprive others, but is built on the principle of the unity of the individual and the masses, which is true happiness.

### Autumn in Shanghai

— Tian He

The azure sky has become a hazy light because of the dust flying on the pier. The autumn sun shines dimly on the river, as if through a gray curtain.

The sound of the anchor chain hitting the waves, the sound of bicycle bells, the cries of trucks seeking employment, the sharp and loud sound of ship whistles... These clamorous shouts circled around the harbor, swirling in the foul air.

Although the season has entered autumn, and the cold wind is whistling, the bodies of the workers are still drenched in sweat through their tattered and dust-covered clothes, because of the heavy load of goods pressed on their backs and the constant running back and forth.

Banners of "Autumn Sales" in various colors are flying on both sides of the road, music, hawking... all kinds of fresh sounds are constantly coming and going, and everything is active. Modern girls wear velvet cheongsams that hug their bodies tightly, and wear a fashionable coat on the outside, especially a pair of high-heeled shoes that are several inches high, making a clattering sound that is particularly eye-catching.

Beep beep... Several cars of special people chased out the bicycle, this is a scene from another corner of the city.

(Lack of reward)

### Worms Born of Rotting Things vs. Rotting Things Born of Worms

— Yong Tian

The ancients thought that things must rot before worms are born. Today's people think differently. They think that the rot of things is caused by worms being born on them. The former is wrong in that the rot of things has nothing to do with worms; but rot caused by worms seems to be the fault of the worms. In fact, the worms are extremely wronged. They have no hatred for people, and they don't have to harm people. The reason why they parasitize on other objects is only because they feel that the place is very suitable for them, so they settle down, have children, and multiply. If you want to blame the worms for growing in that place, you must first ask why that place has an environment suitable for worms to survive.

Many of us make mistakes ourselves, but we lightly put the cause of the mistake on the shoulders of others, or on other things, and we are free from the law, as if it has nothing to do with us. I can't write, but I blame the weather for being too hot. I can't answer the teacher's question, but I say that the teacher's question is too difficult. Of course, the saying that worms are born of rot is also a very good excuse for these people. This place was originally fine, but because worms were born, it is now ulcerated. But you don't know that if you don't break that place, how can worms be born?

Worms are born of rotten things because one's own essence is not strong, and worms are born of rotten things because the essence was originally strong. Knowing that one's own essence is not strong, one will seek information to enrich oneself, and always beware of the invasion of other things. Thinking that one's own essence is great and everything is good will lead to negligence and stagnation, making it easier for other things to invade.

Rather than believing in the new saying that worms are born of rotting things, we should believe in the old saying that rotten things are born of worms, because that will give us strength and make us move forward continuously.

### A Russian Teaches Japanese

— Hua Zhi

The fashion of learning Japanese is popular for a while. Generally, larger organizations hire learned people to teach Japanese in order to broaden their knowledge and benefit their work. Even foreigners are very enthusiastic, and Japanese teachers are in great demand.

When demand exceeds supply, there must be those who muddle through and mix in. Our organization has hired two teachers before and after, and as a result, we have all been absent from the end. Because the service organization has a mixture of Chinese and foreign people, so when we first hired a teacher, we asked a foreign wife who had studied in Japan for the convenience of foreigners.

This foreign wife is very kind and very smooth. She claims to have lived in Japan for eight or nine years and made many foreign friends. She looks completely like a Song person, but can speak French and English. During the teaching process, all kinds of languages are mixed, like a plate of fried mixed vegetables.

In the first few days, she did not use textbooks and only dictated. Her dictation was as fast as a horse, making the students in the class dumbfounded. It turns out that this teacher's teaching method is very unique. First, she does not teach from the alphabet, but from new words, and teaches five or sixty new words in one hour, like memorizing a dictionary. Second, there are no lingual sounds or emphasis in Japanese, but she invented this method. Most foreigners speak Japanese in this way, which is excusable. Third, the teaching materials are not very interesting and monotonous, "tiger", "lion", "pine tree", "floor", "thumb", "index finger", etc., which she often teaches us to memorize. Fourth, the teacher does not know much about how to write Japanese letters, let alone Chinese characters. She only uses English letters to spell out the pronunciation on the blackboard.

After a month, the number of students has been cut in half, and the teacher has taught us more than a thousand new characters, but some students have not even seen the regular script alphabet. Later, when we officially taught the books, the textbook was Volume 1 of the Japanese Language Education Promotion Association's reader, which was rich in literary meaning, and our teacher felt it was tricky, and she would be vague about some difficult sentences. Fortunately, the students did not pursue it.

After two months like this, we taught ten lessons, and the "quiz" was held three times. What about the results? The most hard-working students have only learned two or three sentences and understand seven or eight lessons.

Although Japanese has not been learned, everyone's ambition has not died. Some people think that this Song wife's teaching method is not good and the textbooks are too difficult, so it is difficult to improve. For this reason, we hired another old Russian who had studied Japanese for "more than fifteen years" to be our professor, and used the Japanese reader compiled by the South Manchuria Railway Company for the White Russians as our textbook. This book is extremely simple, and everyone's spirits were lifted on the first day.

When the second class started, the number of people was not as complete as before. This Russian professor was tall and burly, with bright eyes. Judging from his sparse white hair, he was at least fifty years old. He was deaf and nearsighted, and his movements were slow. Everything was not better than the previous teacher. He taught very slowly, and he prepared a special book on teaching methods, focusing on the book. After teaching for two or three hours, he only taught "a pen".

Adults study languages for quick success and understanding. This slow and childish method immediately made people bored. So in less than a week, students dropped out one after another. Although the old professor reduced the tuition fee, he was finally unable to reverse the decline.

Honestly speaking, this old professor can write a few Chinese characters, which is more than enough to teach foreigners, but not enough to teach Chinese. After dropping out of school, everyone discussed it and unanimously agreed that to learn a certain language, one must learn directly from a person of a certain nationality. French should be learned from a Frenchman, English should be learned from an Englishman, and Japanese should at least be learned from a Chinese teacher. As for Song people, they can only teach Russian. I am always a foreign prostitute. Now, the rickshaw pullers in Hongkou have become very familiar with saying a few yuan and a few jiao and what road in Japanese.

### A Scholar is Useless!

— De Gang

In the past, scholars not only had a noble status in society, but also had the opportunity to rise to prominence because of the popularity of the imperial examination system. Therefore, at that time, there was a saying that "everything is inferior, only studying is high", and "if one son receives imperial favor, the whole family eats the emperor's salary." At that time, scholars were indeed envied by everyone in the world!

However, times have changed, and the fate of scholars seems to be getting worse and worse! Especially in this era of great turmoil, the embarrassment and desolation of scholars is even more profound and serious! All those who come from this profession cannot help but sigh: "A scholar is useless"! Today's scholars are not only not treated differently by people, but also complain about their unlucky fate. Everyone is rushing to change careers.

In fact, most of the wealthy and leisurely people in today's society have gained their wealth through petty profits, speculation, and trickery. Most scholars are noble and self-respecting, and they cannot do things that violate reason. They also lack the skills to take advantage of scarcity, so they have no choice but to endure poverty. In the past, "scholars were called the best of all professions", but now it is a way to ruin themselves.

Du Fu said: "Prodigals don't starve to death, and Confucian hats often ruin people." Looking at the 36 professions, studying is the least valuable!

### Sharing the Same Boat Through Storms

Huang Long said, "There's no need to be polite. I'll be the matchmaker." He put down his wine glass, reached out to pull Wei Cheng's hand, and reached out to pull Cui Zhen's hand, and put the two's hands together in the warm atmosphere of the hot pot. Mrs. Ye Yi smiled and said, "Huang Long is really quick. Is this how you make a matchmaker?" As soon as Huang Long let go, Wei Cheng and Cui Zhen also let go. Wei Cheng smiled and said, "This is probably Brother Long's new invention. This is how you make a matchmaker." Huang Long put two chopsticks together like a plant on the table, made a sound, raised them up and pointed at Wei Cheng and said, "That's right. I heard that matchmakers are always running around for things as small as lice, asking the man's family and the woman's family. In fact, they are cheating wine to drink. I don't do that. If I want to drink, I just clear my throat and scratch my neck a few times and say I want to drink, wouldn't that be it?" Cui Zhen turned her face into the darkness and chuckled. Mrs. Ye Er said, "Huang Long, you drink your wine. I want to ask Cui Zhen. Cui Zhen, do you agree?" Cui Zhen turned her face and glanced at Mrs. Ye Er, shook her head and said, "Second Aunt, I don't." Cui Zhen still said this, which could not help but surprise Mrs. Ye Er and Wei Cheng. But Cui Zhen said again, "In the past, if Second Aunt said this, I really wouldn't say another word. Now that I am a person who has been dead and resurrected, I am more than happy to be a maidservant for Second Aunt for the rest of my life. I no longer want to enjoy any blessings that I shouldn't enjoy. Besides..."

Mrs. Ye Er said, "Besides what?" Cui Zhen said, "Before that man Wei made this poisonous move, I saw that Second Aunt's intention and Brother Cheng's intention were to mention this matter. I was happy in my heart. I didn't want my blessings to be thin. Just thinking about it caused trouble. Now I don't want anything. Besides..." Mrs. Ye Er thought, there is another besides, Cui Zhen had already continued, "Besides, I am now disabled. The Ye family in Shide Hall cannot marry a disabled daughter-in-law." Huang Long was secretly drinking and eating vegetables on the side, and also listening to the conversation with his ears perked up. But Wei Cheng waved his hand and smiled, "What Aunt said just now is over. Cui Zhen, you told me that your feet are injured, but you refuse to admit it. Now we can only ask a doctor.
