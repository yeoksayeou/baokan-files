### Indian Congress Party Executive Committee Passes Resolution Guaranteeing Independence; Sends Letters to Roosevelt and Chiang Kai-shek Requesting Guarantee of Indian Independence

Once passed by the All-India Congress on the 8th, written notifications will be sent separately.

Gandhi's Speech on Determination to Fight

Lisbon, 7th (Special Dispatch from the Allied News Agency) – During the All-India Congress meeting on the 7th, Gandhi, amidst unanimous and enthusiastic cheers, took the stage and delivered a speech that lasted for forty minutes without showing any fatigue. The gist of his speech stated that British forces must immediately withdraw from India, or India will launch a non-violent disobedience movement. This struggle against Britain is the greatest in his life, and he would rather fast to death if it is not achieved. He hopes this will be recognized by the Congress. He has always been a friend of Britain, and their current suffering only strengthens his friendship with them. It is precisely because of this friendship that he wishes to point out their errors, but they do not understand this at all. The Congress Party authorities have already approved that the members will obey his instructions. His determination to fight for Indian independence has not diminished in the slightest since 1920; instead, it has grown even stronger. The responsibility of discussing the Executive Committee's resolution is extremely heavy and great. Any decision made by the members will significantly affect the actions of all Indian people. Therefore, if any members oppose the resolution, they must frankly express their opinions. Once a decision is made, the members must devote their full efforts, without any reservations, and resolutely implement it. Furthermore, the representatives of the National Congress Party include Hindus, Muslims, Zoroastrians, etc. Yet, today, Jinnah, the president of the Muslim League, still opposes us. Since our struggle is for freedom, why would Jinnah need to work for the independence movement of the Muslims if the struggle is eliminated? Therefore, we cannot but offer our sincere advice to Mr. Jinnah.

U.S. Denies Taking on Mediation

Lisbon, 7th (Special Dispatch from the Allied News Agency) – U.S. White House authorities have denied reports that the U.S. will mediate the direct conflict between Britain and India. However, a Washington radio station reporter stated on the 7th that Roosevelt might seek a suitable solution with Gandhi. At the same time, synthesizing the opinions of general India experts in Washington, it is difficult to predict how the situation will evolve if India launches a disobedience movement. In any case, Gandhi's claims will further escalate the situation, which is very unfavorable to the position of the United Nations.

Quick Sketch of the All-India Congress Venue

Stockholm, 8th (Special Dispatch from the Reuter Tong News Agency) – The All-India Congress Committee proceeded in Bombay yesterday according to the established procedures.

Order at the venue was maintained by three thousand young members of the party, wearing homespun Indian linen shirts.

The wooden pillars supporting the roof were painted green, white, and tan. Large porcelain containers for storing water were placed throughout the venue, along with 200 large electric fans to dispel the heat. At the entrance, there was a long row of telephones for use by the press.

### German Army Braving Scorching Heat; Continues to Advance Deep into the Caucasus; Maikop Oil Region Threatened; Fierce Fighting Underway in Don River Bend

Berlin, 8th (Special Dispatch from the Allied News Agency) – It was announced today that the German army, having invaded the western Caucasus, yesterday breached the Soviet tank trap positions 17 miles north of Krasnodar (the capital of the Kuban region). German mobile units advanced from the Kuban River bridgehead and reached the Laba River.

Berlin, 8th (Special Dispatch from Havas) – The Supreme Command announced earlier that yesterday the German army continued to attack enemy forces and has reached 20 miles north and northeast of Krasnodar. A breach has been made in the enemy's tank defense line, and the vanguard of the German army has reached the Laba River. The cities of Armavir and Kurgannaya have been occupied by our forces after fierce fighting. German aircraft have been very effective in covering the armored units and bombing the enemy's forward units. The German-Romanian allied forces are fighting under the scorching sun and encountering determined resistance from the Red Army. They have gained a foothold on the north bank of the Sal River and destroyed 23 enemy tanks. In the Don River bend, the German army has also launched an offensive north of Kalach. In the area northwest of Moscow, in Rayevo, the German defensive battles have spread elsewhere. Counterattacks by Soviet troops in several locations have been repelled. Fifty-four Soviet tanks have been destroyed in two days. In the Leningrad area, Soviet troops launched several attacks, and hand-to-hand combat occurred, but the offensives were also repelled.

Moscow, 8th (Special Dispatch from the Allied News Agency) – The Soviet Information Bureau's midnight war bulletin stated that yesterday our forces were still engaged in fierce fighting with the enemy north of Kletskaya, Kotelnikovo, Armavir, and Koshekhabl, with little change in other areas. It also stated that, three days after the major tank battle, the German army has cut off the Krasnodar-Stalingrad railway in Kotelnikovo. This location is approximately 100 miles southwest of Stalingrad and 50 miles east of Tsimlyansk. Furthermore, the German army's fierce offensive in the Caucasus has not weakened at all.

Stockholm, 8th (Special Dispatch from Havas) – Unless there are unexpected changes in the southern Soviet battlefield, the Maikop oil fields may be occupied by the German army within 12 or 24 hours. Yesterday, after the German army occupied Armavir, it crossed Lapinskaya, which is only about 30 miles from Maikop. If the German army advances at its current speed, the 30-mile distance can be reached in a few hours. The situation in Krasnodar is similar. The German army yesterday advanced past Timoshevskaya, which is about 35 miles north of Krasnodar. After Maikop and Krasnodar fall, the German army seems likely to head straight for the two ports of Tuapse and Novorossiysk on the Black Sea coast. If those two ports fall, the Soviet Black Sea Fleet will lose its reliance and will have to flee to the only remaining port of Batumi.

Near the Soviet Border, 7th (Special Dispatch from Havas) – On the 411th day of the German-Soviet war, the German army is advancing south along the Rostov-Grozny-Baku railway at a breakneck pace. In the height of summer, with the scorching sun high in the sky and temperatures reaching 100 degrees Fahrenheit, the German army is still advancing an average of 40 miles per day. The Red Army withdrew from Armavir today, and the city is engulfed in flames. A large number of Red Army troops have been surrounded north of Voroshilovgrad. Tikhoretsk has now been completely occupied. The Red Army has repeatedly launched concentrated counterattacks using cavalry in the area around the city and in several places in the Kuban region. The streets of Tikhoretsk are littered with the bodies of Caucasian cavalrymen and horses. The front line in the Kuban region now runs southwest from the Lisk-Armavir railway, parallel to the railway. The German army is adopting a strategy of central breakthrough at each of these positions to advance towards Maikop and Krasnodar. However, it is believed that the rugged terrain has slowed the German advance. It is likely that the German army will simultaneously attack the four cities of Pyatigorsk, Mineralnye Vody, Krasnodar, and Maikop. The fall of each of these cities is only a matter of time. The terrain in which the Red Army is positioned near Krasnodar and Maikop is extremely unfavorable, and it seems they will have to retreat along the Novorossiysk and Tuapse routes. Therefore, this Red Army has been separated from the main force in the south, and if its defensive area falls again, the consequences will be disastrous, especially the concern that the Soviet Black Sea Fleet will lose its last base. Moreover, once Maikop is occupied, the German army can transfer the troops under General von Manstein, currently in the Crimea, to the front lines without worrying about its rear. Southeast of Voroshilovgrad, the German army is advancing steadily towards the Kuma River. The terrain in this area is extremely flat, and it is possible that the German army will continue its advance at its current pace, or even increase its pace. The German army attaches great importance to the offensive in this area, as occupying the Kuma River would allow them to control the Armavir-Baku railway. In addition, fighting continues between the Sal River and the Don River. It is reported that the German-Romanian allied forces have broken through the Red Army's positions near Kotelnikovo, 60 miles southwest of Stalingrad. The Red Army north of the Don River bend was forced to cross the river, abandoning its bridgehead near Serafimovich. However, a large number of fresh troops have arrived, and several regiments of heavy tanks have also arrived southwest of Stalingrad in preparation for a major battle. The German air force has been extremely active in recent days, bombing the railway lines to Moscow and Stalingrad without reservation. According to aircraft reconnaissance reports, the railway is very busy, suggesting that a large army is being sent to Stalingrad to reinforce it.

German Shock Troops Cross the Desert to Attack Astrakhan

Near the Border of Ukraine, 7th (Special Dispatch from Havas) – It has just been learned that the German High Command has dispatched an army, via the Kalmyk Desert, to advance on Astrakhan. After breaking through the Red Army's defenses, the German army has advanced 100 miles to the southeast, and its vanguard is only 130 miles from Astrakhan. As for the most notable developments in other areas, these are the successive fall of Armavir and Eisk, and the interruption of the Moscow-Stalingrad railway. At present, the main force of the German army is continuing to advance between the Don and Sal Rivers. Although the details are unknown, the general situation shows that the Axis forces have a clear advantage. In the Caucasus, the German army is also advancing rapidly. Last night, it was only 15 miles from Pyatigorsk, and the German right flank had reached Timoshevskaya (40 miles north of Krasnodar). Another armored unit is also advancing towards the Krasnodar oil field, apparently intending to seize Georgievsk. To the west, the German army crossed the Kuban River yesterday and continued to advance westward. In addition, a large armored unit is currently advancing towards Maikop, and German reconnaissance units have reached the outskirts of the city, although this has not yet been confirmed. Between the Sea of Azov and the Rostov-Armavir railway, the Axis forces made further progress yesterday, continuing to advance along the north bank of the Kuban River. Another unit is advancing towards the Black Sea, its objective being to capture Krasnodar. The Red Army is currently setting up defenses in the area to continue its resistance.

### Stalin's Secret Military Order: Defending Troops Must Not Retreat

### High Alert on Turkey's Eastern Border; Sudden Closure of the Turkish-Syrian Border

Ankara, 8th (Special Dispatch from the Reuter Tong News Agency) – Well-informed sources here say that the Turkish authorities are continuing to make all necessary preparations in the ports along the Black Sea so that Soviet warships can be detained if they try to escape there. However, political circles generally still believe that the Soviets will scuttle their ships themselves after losing their last seaports. At the same time, the defense forces of Turkey's eastern provinces have been reinforced, and precautionary measures have been taken along the border. Any Soviet soldiers who cross the border to escape will be detained.

Turkish Capital, 7th (Special Dispatch from Havas) – According to reliable sources here, the border between Turkey and Syria has been closed, for reasons unknown.

### British and German Forces in North Africa Actively Reinforcing

Near the Egyptian Border, 7th (Special Dispatch from Havas) – In recent days, there has been no change in the positions of the belligerent parties along the Egyptian front, from the Mediterranean coast to the Qattara Depression. However, the air forces of both sides have been as active as ever. According to British sources, British aircraft have bombed the port of Derna and Axis communication lines. Both sides are using the lull in the fighting to strengthen their positions. It is reported that General Auchinleck has transferred a large number of reinforcements, and his stockpiles of food and ammunition have also increased. In addition, large tanks have been transferred from Sudan to the front lines. Generals Rommel and Kesselring have also transferred a large number of German troops from Crete, most of whom have been transported to the port of Tobruk by air or sea. British aircraft are constantly bombing this port for this reason. Generals Rommel and Kesselring have also transferred a large number of tanks, and the number of armored units has reached at least two divisions. In addition, the 164th Division, a crack unit, is currently being reorganized in Egypt, incorporating fresh troops transferred from Greece. The Italian armored units have also been reinforced. A large number of artillery pieces have been transferred from Italy, and many trucks are seen heading to the front lines every day.

Rome, 8th (Special Dispatch from the Reuter Tong News Agency) – The Italian High Command announced this afternoon that British aircraft attempted to attack our military positions on the Egyptian front and thirteen were shot down by German aircraft. In addition, two enemy aircraft were shot down by anti-aircraft guns, and two enemy airmen were captured. Our aircraft bombed the enemy's supply centers, with considerable success.

### British and American Expansion of Aid to the Soviet Union: Moscow Conference; Military and Political Matters Included in Discussions; Churchill-Stalin Meeting Confirmed

Lisbon, August 8th, Associated Press: According to reliable sources in Washington, a conference is being held in Moscow with the aim of finding ways to aid the Soviet Union. Participants include U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Admiral Standley; U.S. Air Force Commander, Major General Brereton; British Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Kerr; and French representative to the Soviet Union, Garreau.

Ankara, August 8th, Huitong News Agency: A telegram from Kuibyshev confirms the reports from London that Churchill has flown to Moscow. The Churchill-Stalin meeting is said to be definitely confirmed.

Bern, Switzerland, August 7th, Havas: British Prime Minister Churchill's whereabouts are now the subject of much speculation in European capitals. According to the Geneva Tribune, diplomatic talks are being conducted in Moscow between Roosevelt's representative Brereton and British Ambassador Kerr and the Soviet side. The British side considers this to be extremely important. Although Soviet officials claim it is a discussion of routine matters, it is generally believed that this meeting is nothing more than a discussion of active methods to aid the Soviet Union, roughly including the following four points: 1. Opening a second battlefield in Western Europe; 2. Implementing large-scale air raids on Germany; 3. Increasing the supply of military needs to the Soviet Union; 4. Sending British and American troops to reinforce the Eastern Front. It is heard that the British side generally believes that action must be taken now no matter what, so as to prevent the situation from worsening. It is better to accept all dangers and immediately open a second battlefield than to fight the entire German army in the future.

Bern, Switzerland, August 7th, Havas: Political observers here recently stated that very important talks are currently underway in Moscow, discussing the entire world's military and political situation. After British Ambassador Sir Kerr and U.S. Ambassador Admiral Standley arrived in Moscow from Kuibyshev together, former U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union and current Ambassador to Turkey, Steinhardt, also departed for the Soviet capital today. As for the talk of Prime Minister Churchill visiting the Soviet Union, judging from the fact that the Prime Minister has been unable to attend to official duties in recent days, and the fact that representatives of 100,000 British workers were dispatched yesterday to No. 10 Downing Street, the Prime Minister's residence, to petition the government to immediately open a second battlefield, but the authorities refused to receive them on the grounds that no appointment had been made with the Prime Minister, all these factors indirectly prove that Prime Minister Churchill is indeed not in the capital. In addition, President Roosevelt's dispatch of an air force general carrying his personal letter to Stalin, and representing the United States in negotiations regarding expanding American aid to the Soviet Union, is also of great significance. President Roosevelt's particular emphasis on the air force can also be seen from this. In short, both Washington and London are deeply aware of the need to maintain the closest contact with Moscow as quickly as possible, which can almost be asserted.

Speculation About the Allied Commander-in-Chief

Stockholm, Sweden, August 8th, Huitong News Agency: Local newspapers report that dispatches from London state that the conference held in Moscow between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union is the issue of greatest interest to people in London at present. However, British newspapers have not yet published detailed reports regarding the representatives attending the meeting and the content of the discussions. London officials have not yet formally acknowledged that Prime Minister Churchill has arrived in Moscow. The London correspondent of the Swedish "Social Democratic Newspaper" believes that this Moscow negotiation has extremely important significance, and the overall plans of Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, and its allies will be put forward for discussion. Correspondents from other newspapers speculate that the issue of establishing a commander-in-chief for Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union to jointly fight in order to enhance combat effectiveness will also be raised for discussion. Regarding the selection of the future commander-in-chief, the voice of U.S. Chief of Staff General Marshall is relatively low, and the voice of Lieutenant General McNaughton, Commander-in-Chief of the Canadian Overseas Forces, is gradually increasing. However, regarding the above-mentioned news, British officials have not yet confirmed any reports. Currently, informed sources in London only say that Moscow has the determination to continue fighting under any circumstances, and this idea has not wavered.

British and American Ambassadors Leave Turkey for the Meeting

Istanbul, August 8th, Huitong News Agency: American sources here confirm that U.S. Ambassador to Turkey, Steinhardt, has departed for Moscow, and it is heard that he will participate in the negotiations currently underway in the Soviet capital. British Ambassador to Turkey, Knatchbull-Hugessen, has also departed from Istanbul, and his destination seems to also be Moscow. His mission is likely the same as Steinhardt's. Political figures in Istanbul are paying close attention to the simultaneous departure of the British and American ambassadors. The report that Churchill is currently in Moscow can be seen from this.

### Britain Divided into Twelve Defense Zones: Decentralized System to Cope with Emergencies; Germany Takes Preventive Measures in the Netherlands and Norway

Dublin, August 7th, Havas: Britain has now been divided into twelve defense zones, adopting a decentralized system. In the event of a foreign invasion or emergency, there may be blockades between zones, and communications between each zone and London may also be cut off. To cope with emergencies, a commissioner is appointed, who, when necessary, will jointly organize a "Local Defense Committee" with military officers to maintain local government affairs. Currently, representatives from various British government departments are stationed permanently in the commissioner's office of each zone to assist the commissioner in handling affairs in each zone. It is heard that this system will continue to be maintained even in peacetime, as this measure can not only reduce the work of Parliament but also tailor measures to local conditions, facilitating various central and local legislative works.

Stockholm, Sweden, August 7th, Havas: According to news from the capital of Norway, the entire coast from the Swedish border to the port of Kirkenes has been declared a state of emergency since August 1st, but officials have not yet formally announced this.

Bern, Switzerland, August 7th, Havas: Reports state that the German occupation headquarters in the Netherlands recently issued a proclamation, sternly warning the Dutch people not to assist the enemy attempting to land on the country's coast, or they will be executed. At the same time, it also ordered the people of the Netherlands to kill or hand over to the authorities any enemy airmen encountered, and that this measure should be implemented before the 13th of this month.

Stockholm, Sweden, August 7th, Havas: According to news from Norway, the Norwegian Central Police Bureau is currently undergoing a thorough reorganization, with several senior police officers either being dismissed or demoted and transferred to local police stations.

### Atmospheric Pressure Remains Extremely High and Dry: Epidemic Spreads More Severely; More Than 1,600 Epidemic Cases This Summer; Passengers Must Get Off Trams at Bridge and Be Inspected

The high heat has not subsided slightly, and the highest temperature is still above 100 degrees. The summer heat is truly frightening. According to a reporter from the Datong News Agency yesterday, the highest temperature recorded by the Observatory yesterday was still 102.4 degrees Fahrenheit (39.1 degrees Celsius). The sun's rays blazed all day, and the umbrella market was bustling. However, the wind was slightly stronger, and the observed atmospheric pressure remained extremely high and dry.

Number of Injections

The number of citizens in the two concessions receiving epidemic prevention injections from the health departments is increasing daily. On the 7th alone, the total number of people injected by the health departments of the two concessions reached 66,052, including 35,052 in the International Settlement and 27,000 in the French Concession. It is heard that the International Settlement health authorities received reports of six suspected cholera cases and four deaths on the 7th, while the French Concession had fourteen suspected cholera cases and four deaths. By Wednesday, a total of 53,756 people had been injected, and on Thursday, a total of 58,786 people had been injected.

Epidemic Situation

The English-language "Shanghai Times" reported yesterday that the total number of cholera cases found in the city, as of Thursday evening, has reached 1,617, about twice the 813 cases for the entire summer of last year, and 258 of them have already died. According to the explanation of the health department authorities, the large number of cholera cases can be divided into two types: one is the confirmed cases, and the other is the unconfirmed cases. All patients who believe they have contracted cholera and seek treatment from hospitals, but have not been proven, are classified into the second category. However, there are often deaths in this second category of patients, so that the doctors cannot confirm whether the cause of death is due to cholera. So far, the French Concession has received reports of 339 cases of infection, with 42 deaths, of which 137 cases have not been confirmed as genuine cholera. The International Settlement has discovered 233 cholera cases, with 49 deaths. As for those infected in the Chinese areas, it has reached more than 1,000 people.

Passenger Inspection

In the International Settlement, in order to prevent the spread of the cholera epidemic, special personnel have been sent to check epidemic prevention equipment on trams on all routes since the previous day. At the same time, when trolleybuses on Routes 18 and 14, and trams on Routes 1, 12, and 5 pass through various bridges, passengers must get off the bus and walk, and are only allowed to re-board the bus after presenting their epidemic prevention certificates.

Hongkou Quarantine

The inspection of epidemic prevention certificates is extremely strict in Hongkou. The person in charge is the Japanese Naval Landing Force. At the Waihong Bridge, Zhonghong Bridge, and Lihong Bridge, there are one or two squads of soldiers stationed at each bridge entrance. All passengers on trams, cars, and rickshaws who are allowed to pass must get off the vehicle and present their epidemic prevention certificates. Those without certificates or with expired certificates will be forcibly injected by the mobile injection team stationed on the bridge before being allowed to pass. Due to the recent prevalence of cholera in the Nanshi area, a large-scale disinfection of wells within the boundary has been started since yesterday. An appropriate amount of disinfectant is added to the well depending on its size, and it is stipulated that people are only allowed to take drinks two hours after disinfection.

### Extortion and Robbery: Miscreants Undeterred by Law; Caught Again

Yanghuo stores such as the Rich-New-Rising, Rixin Sheng, the Kai Zi Er Lu Hengfeng on the Avenue Edward VII have received threatening letters demanding millions of dollars since April of last year. After receiving a report from the French Concession Police, they successively arrested the bandits Zhou Zhengming (25 years old, from Haiyan) and local residents Li Kaiming (19 years old), Li Hongkui (25 years old), Cai Ming (35 years old), etc. and brought them to the French court for trial, sentencing them to nine months in prison each. They were released from prison in early March of this year. However, Zhou and others remained incorrigible.

And Plot Revenge

They even sent letters to the above-mentioned foreign goods stores demanding to borrow huge sums of money, otherwise they would definitely deal with them by drastic measures. The end of the letter was signed "Gang Zi." The stores ignored the letters after receiving them. Zhou and others then made phone calls urging payment, but the stores still ignored them. Until the month of Jiao, Zhou Zhengming colluded with Li Kaiming and the fugitives Wu Ruisheng and Fang Bingyou to rob the Wang family, owner of the Dingsheng store at No. 419 Zhonghui Building, of clothing and ornaments worth

More Than 1,000 Yuan

Later, the father robbed a machine factory on Malang Road of huge sums of money. After each of the victims reported the case to the police and requested an arrest, Inspector Qin Youyu, Detective Dai Rongji, and Detective Chen Fusheng of the Chinese Detective Bureau first arrested the bandits Li Hongkui and Cai Ming on Wangzhi Road, who confessed that Zhou Zhengming and Li Kaiming were hiding in the Huxi Hotel in Caojiadu, Huxi. They raided the hotel together with the local Japanese and Chinese military police on the previous day, arrested the two bandits Zhou and Li, and found two pistols under the bed.

### Construction Youth Corps Holds Welcome Meeting with Yokoyama: Minister Yokoyama Delivers Speech

According to the Allied Press, the headquarters of the China Revival Society's Construction Youth Corps held a meeting with Lieutenant Colonel Yokoyama, Chief of the Reporting Department of the Japanese Army, at a certain location in Hongkou on the previous day. Minister Yokoyama and more than 30 cadres, including the two chiefs of the team, Shen and Gu Zhengfu, were present. Minister Yokoyama delivered a speech, and the two chiefs, Shen and Gu, also expressed their opinions first. The text of Minister Yokoyama's speech is recorded on the left:

"I (Yokoyama, Chief of the Reporting Department, refers to himself) am very honored to meet with the members of the Youth Corps for the first time today. I have something to tell you about the war against Britain and the United States. China and Japan are of the same race and the same writing. Their races, habits, and cultures are the same. Everyone should treat each other with sincerity in order to dispel misunderstandings and complete overall peace.

Japan was very difficult in the early days of its founding. There was also corruption among the Japanese people at that time. Because everyone was aware of it, they carried out the Restoration Movement and thoroughly reformed, and Japan gradually embarked on the road to strength. However, Japan's greatest goal is to sincerely build East Asia. It is hoped that the people of East Asia will join hands to build the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere.

This Greater East Asia War was caused by the invasion of East Asia by Britain and the United States, not by Japan's challenge. The Anglo-American military conspiracy has been oppressing East Asia for a long time, and we must rise up and fight. We must fundamentally destroy the Anglo-American forces in East Asia with truth and military force. Today is the time when we must strive. I dare to frankly contribute Japan's determination to strive, which is to complete the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. For example, India is of the Asian race, and the British have oppressed it to the extreme. Now India has already risen up to fight. India must be a link in the Co-Prosperity Sphere.

Regarding the hope of the Co-Prosperity Sphere, I believe that the sun rises from the east and sets in the west. The people under the sunlight should have a beginning and an end like the sunlight, and strive together for the Co-Prosperity Sphere, so that society can develop and the people can be happy. There are people under the sunlight, and the people should have justice and truth, and work together for the happiness of the people.

I believe that Britain is the worst country in the world. It specializes in alienating and instigating conflicts between various ethnic groups, causing them to fight each other and seek profit. After the outbreak of the Franco-German War in the last European War, the countries on both sides of the Alliance and the Entente were involved in the war, and Britain was the culprit of the war. In the end, many countries realized that they had been fooled. This World War was due to Britain's conspiracy, which first triggered the Sino-Japanese Incident, then triggered the Franco-German War, and then triggered the German-Soviet War. In short, Britain's attempt was to instigate various countries to kill each other, and then seek the fisherman's profit.

For example, in shipping, if a Japanese person is on a foreigner's ship and the ship encounters danger in the middle of the journey, it is logical that the shipping authorities should protect the passengers and allow them to escape first, and then the crew should escape. But Anglo-American ships are not like that. When they encounter danger, they only allow the crew to escape, regardless of the lives and property of the Japanese passengers. Anglo-Americans are very selfish. They only need their own safety and do not hesitate to sacrifice the lives of others. Britain considers itself to be a superior country, and considers Japan and China to be inferior countries. People in inferior countries are not given preferential treatment. This situation makes us have to be angry, so we must defeat them.

Your country's founding father, Mr. Sun Yat-sen, and Mr. Toyama Mitsuru, worked together for the friendship and cooperation between China and Japan. Mr. Sun once said that if we want to strengthen China and liberate the East Asian peoples, we must work hand in hand with Japan. I was also in Japan at the time, and I studied with Chinese students. We all admired the spirit of Mr. Sun and Mr. Tou for their long-term plan for East Asia, and we agreed that we should inherit the spirit of the sages and work hard to complete the unfulfilled mission.

Sun Yat-sen's original name was Yixian, and he changed his name to Zhongshan in Tokyo. Today, we all know him as Mr. Zhongshan. In fact, he took the name in Japan. During the Russo-Japanese War, Mr. Sun advocated Pan-Asianism in Britain. At that time, Britain and Japan were still in an alliance, and the British were already jealous of Japan's strength. Mr. Sun, as a sage, had already begun to advocate Pan-Asianism.

In short, building the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere is everyone's business. Everyone must sincerely work hard to increase production in order to enhance our strength to resist Britain and the United States. Just as gas is used to emit light, and steam is used to generate power, we must cater to the times. If we build a machine, we must be able to research it on the one hand and be able to apply it on the other. Recently, we have also cooperated with Vietnam. Some people oppose this move, but we demand that the economic structures of various parts of East Asia be balanced and circulated. If Anglo-American goods do not come, we must still find sources. We want to harmonize the economies of Vietnam and China. After the Japanese army entered Vietnam, there was a shortage of goods in the stores in Vietnam at first, but later the goods gradually circulated, so Annam and other places had thoroughly understood the truth of economic co-prosperity. Recently, China has a shortage of gasoline and asked Japan to subsidize it, so Japan's gasoline made up for China's lack of gasoline. Just like paper, on the one hand it is consumed, and on the other hand there should be manufacturing methods, so the Co-Prosperity Sphere is to harmonize production and sales, and there is appropriate coordination of material and human resources.

Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, because the war is in progress, it is inevitable that there will be an impact from the war. For example, the invasion of submarines and planes, Qingdao and Shanghai, etc., may be affected, so Japan is now working hard to build defenses and strive to prepare for any eventuality. We want to make the people in the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere as if they are under an iron umbrella, so that the people can live and work in peace and contentment, and various constructions are coordinated and developed for the Co-Prosperity Sphere. In short, we must treat each other frankly and sincerely, and work together to complete the Co-Prosperity Sphere. We ask the people of the Co-Prosperity Sphere to unite together, and concentrate human and material resources for the Co-Prosperity Sphere. I have been dispatched to come here, and I will do my best to sacrifice and strive to the end for the completion of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere."

### Rice Industry Notifies All Stores to Conscientiously Sell Rations; Bundling Sales of Flour May Be Suspended for a Period

The sixth installment of rations will be sold starting tomorrow. In order to prevent ration rice stores from engaging in malpractice and irregular behavior when selling household rations, the concession authorities have adopted strict measures to monitor whether there are any shortages in the amount of rice sold by each rice store selling household rations. For rice stores with irregular behavior, they will be punished according to the seriousness of the circumstances. The rice industry has reiterated the previous order, notifying all member rice stores to share the authorities' goal of maintaining the people's food supply, serve the public, and check the measuring instruments accurately when selling household rations, and measure with standard measuring instruments. If, due to temporary negligence in inspection, there is a shortage in the amount and is punished, the guild will not provide protection. Be careful not to regret it.

The Seventh Installment Will Sell Corn in Addition

The Rice and Grain Affairs Office of the two concessions is now seriously considering, and plans to instruct each rice store to also sell broken corn when selling the seventh installment of household rice (from the 17th to the 22nd). However, the purchase method and the amount allowed to be purchased are still being negotiated. If it is to be implemented at that time, it will be jointly announced, and starting from that installment, flour may be temporarily suspended from being allocated. It is found that since the start of rationed food distribution in the city, rice stores have not only sold white rice and broken rice, but also sold flour at the same time. Each household can purchase one and a half catties per installment, so the amount of flour sold so far has been very considerable. In order to suit rationing purposes, it is planned to take this measure.

French Concession Baojia Heads Issued Special Identification Cards

After the completion of the Baojia system in the French Concession, the French authorities greatly praised the fact that the Baojia heads in each district were able to fulfill their missions, so special identification cards were issued for the identification cards of each Bao and Jia head. First, for identification purposes, and second, the certificate has several conveniences, such as special passage, to reward their hard work. It is learned that the Baojia heads in each district have already issued application forms from the Lianbao in each district and requested to be issued after filling them out. It is expected that they will be officially issued within a few days.

Rationed Bread Not Yet Sold Widely

The matter of issuing rationed bread has started yesterday. The authorities of the two concessions issued another notice last night, making some changes to the price of bread. From now on, the wholesale price of bread will be set at 2 yuan and 5 jiao in Central Reserve Certificates per pound, and the retail price will be 2 yuan and 7 jiao and 5 fen in Central Reserve Certificates per pound. The size of the bread should be appropriately specified. Bread shops only sell bread to those who hold bread coupons. Not all bread shops in the French Concession sold rationed bread yesterday. It is learned that this is because residents in some districts have not yet obtained bread certificates.

### Living Standards of Chinese Employees Edited by the Industrial and Social Affairs Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council (4)

Abstract

Based on analysis and observation, the situation is most difficult for employee families belonging to the so-called "gown-wearing class," especially those with lower incomes. In recent times, living expenses have risen sharply. Even families with higher incomes may not be much better off. The decline in the living standards of this employee class can be attributed to several factors: The salaries of employees are not very high to begin with. Since the outbreak of war, prices have risen far more than the allowances added. Among one hundred households, 42% of heads of households earn less than 100 to 200 old legal tender yuan in regular salary, 22% earn less than 100 yuan, and 36% earn 200 yuan or more. The distribution is shown in the following table:

Even before the war, when the currency value had not depreciated, a salary of 100 yuan for a family of eight meant an average of just under 13 yuan per person, which was insufficient to cover the costs of food, clothing, housing, and transportation. Last year, in December, the average head of household allowance was slightly more than 1.8 times the original salary. The increase in allowances lagged far behind the rise in prices. This is the first reason.

Employee families have many children, averaging 3.45 per family, compared to 2.14 for worker families. Among one hundred households, eight have no children, while the remaining ninety-two have a total of three hundred and forty-five children. The distribution is as follows:

Number of Children Number of Families

1 12

2 18

3 8

4 24

5 13

6 8

7 8

8 1

Total 92 Families

The majority of heads of household and housewives keeping accounts are in their prime. The average age of the head of household is 36.89 years, and the average age of the housewife is 33.50 years. There are 24 families with four children. The more people there are, the less money is available per person for food, clothing, housing, and transportation. This is the second reason.

Employee families often have dependents, averaging 1.15 per family, compared to only 0.90 for worker families. Employee families still maintain the large family system, so the head of household bears a heavy burden. This is the third reason. An analysis of dependents is recorded below:

Dependent Average Number of People per Family

Yesterday, the jewelry gold price of Dazhong and Tongxing Jewelry Shops in this city was changed. The selling price per tael was still 2,100. The purchase price was reduced by 350 yuan.

The Numbers "Thousand" and "Hundred" on Allocation Slips Must Be Written in Uppercase

Dayuan Bank Bill Agency Exchange

This year, the Banking Industry Joint Reserve Committee yesterday sent a circular to the exchange banks, saying that it has been decided that from August 10th of this year (next Monday), the committee will start acting as the agency for the Dayuan Bank bill exchange, and the bank's exchange bank number will be 52.11.

The association also issued an unnumbered circular yesterday, saying that it has been found that the number of checks (i.e., allocation slips) issued by the fellow banks to the association's current account often contains the characters "thousand" and "hundred". Because the "人" radical is not added, they are easily altered by others. Recently, there have been cases of checks opened to the association by fellow banks, which were discovered in time and were not deceived. In order to prevent such abuses, please write all the "thousand" and "hundred" characters on the checks opened by the bank in the future in uppercase, "仟" and "佰", so as to be cautious.

There is No Lack of Absorption at Low Prices Cotton Cloth Price Increase More Intense

East Spun Goods Market, yesterday, was stable and firm. The new order for 12-pound dragon head fine cloth opened at 166 yuan. The low price was 164 yuan, and the closing price rose to 168 yuan, an increase of 3 yuan per bolt from the previous day. Silver orders were 154 yuan, colorful ball fine cloth was 157 yuan, and Flying Fish was 155 yuan, all up 4 yuan. Five Fortune twill was 149 yuan. The opening price of the four gentlemen serge was 6 yuan 6.2 cents, and the low price was 6 yuan 5.2 cents. Because there were many absorbers at low prices, the closing price rose to 6 yuan 6.8 cents, and each code rose 1.3 cents. The bank's single price was 6 yuan 1.5 cents, an increase of 5 cents.

Factory Cloth The peers on this street have a slight appetite, and the market is showing a strong trend. 16-pound earth coarse cloth is 170 yuan, and each bolt has increased by 5 yuan. Flying Hong is 165 yuan, an increase of 2 yuan. The new word of 9 pounds is 107 yuan, flat. The 12-pound earth fine cloth is 150 yuan, an increase of 4 yuan. The Dapeng is 145 yuan, up 3 yuan. Changshou crepe is 5 yuan 7 cents, and Changting is 5 yuan 5 cents, each code up 1 cent.

New Branches and Dried Fruits Compete for Sale at Low Profits The Goods are Sold Out Instantly This Year's Harvest is More Abundant

This time the new branches and dried fruits are on the stage, and the products of Guangdong and Fujian provinces have arrived. For example, the glutinous rice branches of Guangdong are the best of the dried branches. The difference between the opening price and the selling price is less than 1 cent. The rest, such as Jinshan Yuan branches, flat branches, and Zhangzhou's early red branches, are mostly sold at the opening price, with extremely low profits. Therefore, although the number of arrivals has reached more than 1,500 boxes, they have all been sold out, and most of them have been taken away along the Hangzhou Road. The selling price of glutinous rice branches is 1,600 yuan, Jinshan Yuan branches is 600 yuan, Jinshan flat branches is 660 yuan, early red branches is 400 yuan, and Chen Lanxing branches is 350 yuan. This year's harvest is more abundant, and the number of arrivals in the future will inevitably loosen again, so the parties are holding a sacrificial attitude in order to expand sales.

Sugar Stocks Spin and Decrease Slightly

Yesterday, the sugar stock order of the Sugar Merchants Cooperative Business Office was restored due to Saturday, and the transaction was sparse, and the trend was hovering slightly loose. The association's board of directors still set the initial market price of coarse sugar shares at 299 yuan, and then closed at 298.5 yuan, with a total turnover of 700 bags, which is half a yuan less than the previous day. Red sugar shares were not traded.

Tangerine Cakes Are in High Demand

Bridge cakes are in high demand, and those who have arrived at Gulangyu have not been shipped out due to the lack of convenient wheels recently. Yesterday, it was heard that someone had arrived with a dozen pieces, and the asking price was surprisingly high. The parties did not bargain, resulting in a lack of transactions. It is expected that there will be a regular market when the goods arrive at Shen.

Cheap Goods are Distributed The Bean Market Turns Loose

The bean market has been affected by the continuous distribution of cheap beans, and buyers' willingness to enter the market is small. Therefore, the market is showing a loose and flat trend. A total of 70 bags of Tianjin green beans were opened, priced at 228 yuan to 225 yuan, and 90 bags of red beans were priced at 165 yuan, and 100 bags of Sangyuan soybeans were priced at 173 yuan.

The supply and demand of bean cakes are scarce, and the market is generally flat. Yesterday, 500 pieces of the February stack order of Shengji cakes were opened, priced at 60 yuan 7.5 cents.

Bran is still sluggish for domestic sales, and there are few sellers, but the price has turned stable and firm. Yesterday, the stack order of the Xin small package bran in May was opened for 300 bags, priced at 95 yuan to 95.5 yuan.

Summer Medicine Suffers from Squeezing

Summer medicines are still weak and unsustainable. Because customer sales are very rare, general hoarders are eager to sell. The sales on this street are generally squeezed by miscellaneous brands, so the price is powerless to rise. For example, Tiger Brand headache powder is 20 yuan, Ten Thousand Gold Oil is 17 yuan 5 cents, Bagua Dan is 15 yuan, Partridge Vegetable is 52 yuan 5 cents, Dragon Tiger Rendan is 14 yuan, and Invincible Tooth Powder is 9 yuan 2 cents. The selling prices are all downstream, and it is difficult to sell them.

### Soap Market Suddenly Turns Cold

Among daily necessities, such as the selling price of soap, after the price limit was announced by the authorities, the black market selling price suddenly became quiet. The peers' competition for sales has mostly stopped, because there are few benefits and many harms. Furthermore, it is difficult to transport by car, and they are willing to let go of the business. Therefore, the market atmosphere is even more sluggish. If Huang Xiangmao soap can still be sold, the transaction has not disappeared. The quoted price is still 210 yuan, and the rest have very few transactions. Gu Benzao is 290 yuan, Bai Xiangmaozao is 230 yuan, Scissorzao is 250 yuan, Phoenix brand matches are 2,650 yuan, Beauty brand is 2,850 yuan, Golden Ding brand is 2,500 yuan, miscellaneous brands are 2,100 yuan, White Reese foreign candles are 120 yuan, Monk Hat brand is 115 yuan, and miscellaneous brands are 90 yuan, all showing a market with no transactions.

### The Problem of Maids in the Family

— Li

In general families, the problem of maids often becomes a topic of discussion for housewives. The maid in House A is lazy in doing things, the maid in House B often steals things, and the maid in House C gets up too late.

However, thinking calmly, maids are mostly uneducated. They don't know their responsibilities, nor do they understand the meaning of their lives. Therefore, everything still needs to be guided by the housewife. Moreover, sometimes the lack of planning by housewives can also be said to be one of the reasons why housework cannot be carried out smoothly. Here are a few methods that may be helpful for housewives:

There should be a plan for all the housework to be done. What to do on Monday, what to do on Tuesday. Do not change the plan temporarily, causing chaos and making the maids complain.

The menu for each day should have a little planning, and tell the maid the night before or in the morning so that they can do some preparation work. Of course, it would be best if housewives could take on the design work themselves.

When hiring a new maid, the rules of the house must be told to her one by one.

There should be regulations for the time to get up and rest every day.

Housewives' own work should also be scheduled so that it can be coordinated with the work of the maids.

When maids can fulfill their responsibilities for their work, everything else does not need to be worried about.

The three most important points when choosing a maid are honesty, diligence, and health.

When there are things worth rewarding, they should be rewarded.

### Great Women

— Hua

In this new era, both men and women can receive equal education. Therefore, many great achievements are created by women.

For this point, we can easily cite a few examples below.

Madam Curie, together with her husband, invented radium, opening up a new path for the medical community. The creator of the World Red Cross Society was not a man, but Crenna Biden. Tonkloff of Sweden was a Nobel Prize winner. The daughter of President Wilson helped her father with medical books. Ossa Johnson helped her husband with exploration work and co-authored books describing the lives of natives in Africa. The founder of Mother's Day was Anna Jarvers. There was also Mary Lyon, who founded the first women's university in the United States. These are all great works.

Women have many things to do. When praising the greatness of women, I hope that more great women will be produced.

### Between Sisters-in-Law

— Yingdai

If we make a careful observation of general families, then anyone can see that there are many disputes in the family, which often arise from sisters-in-law. The so-called sisters-in-law are usually called elder sister-in-law and younger sister-in-law. Between sisters-in-law, there are indeed some who can get along, but most of them are incompatible and often argue and quarrel.

Sometimes, we can see that in a good family, the brothers are originally very harmonious. But after marrying their wives, the disharmony between the sisters-in-law affects the feelings between the brothers. Even the brothers gradually discriminate against each other due to discord, eventually becoming strangers. The affection of blood relatives is completely gone. A good family is turned into a constant source of quarrels.

We further study why disputes occur between sisters-in-law, probably because parents-in-law treat their daughters-in-law differently, or they demand to divide the property and form small families. Most women are narrow-minded. If they do more work or receive less money, they will express injustice and start to attack each other. They may even fight openly from behind, often quarreling.

From the above, we can see that the reason for the disharmony between sisters-in-law is partly caused by the different love or treatment of the parents-in-law, but on the other hand, the sisters-in-law themselves certainly have factors that cause disputes. The main thing is that everyone has selfish intentions and suspects and envies each other. When they become incompatible, they will quarrel or dispute, affecting the happiness of the entire family.

Therefore, in order to maintain the happiness of the family, we hope that sisters-in-law can avoid disputes. On the one hand, we should hope that the parents-in-law treat their daughters-in-law the same, regardless of how much they do. On the other hand, the sisters-in-law should not have prejudices or suspicions, do more work, and share less property, but cherish each other like sisters. As for the brothers, they should also be a little manly. Pillow talk should not be listened to. When the wife is talking bad about her sister-in-law, not only should she not be believed, but also explained and persuaded.

If this can be done, the sisters-in-law will be harmonious all year round and there will be no quarrels. As a result, family disputes and troubles can be avoided, at least in part. In other words, the happiness in the family can be maintained or increased because of the harmony of the sisters-in-law.

### Rice Supplements

— Tianyi

Nothing in the world is more difficult than eating. Especially now in Shanghai. Therefore, in this time of "rice as expensive as pearls," you have to think of other ways. The following are ways to remedy the lack of rice.

Mung Bean Porridge: In this hot weather, eating cold mung bean porridge in the morning and evening is refreshing and palatable.

Red Bean Rice: First, heat the red beans and water in a pot, then add the rice. Once the rice is cooked, it will turn red, which is beautiful. It is also fragrant and delicious when eaten.

Vegetable Rice with Potatoes: When cooking vegetable rice, add some potatoes to eat together for a better flavor.

The above three methods are just a few examples. This not only solves the "lack of rice" problem, but also the price of mung beans, red beans, and potatoes is cheaper than white rice. If you often rotate and change the patterns, you can also adjust your appetite.

Family Mailbox

Dear Editor, you complain that I don't say polite words. I also have a difficult problem now. Please give me some advice.

Since I met a boyfriend last year, he is loyal and reliable, and has superior knowledge, a noble profession, and an aspiring ambition. His character is good and his attitude is generous. I really admire him very much. My love with him can be said to have entered a decisive stage. Unexpectedly, recently my parents vaguely arranged a marriage with another man without my knowledge. When I learned about it, the matter was already settled. I immediately objected to this unfree marriage. Although the other party is quite rich, I don't like the lazy playboy. I often say to my parents, "It's better to have a skill than to have millions of wealth," but I can't win my parents' consent, and sometimes I even get scolded. Please tell me what good strategy to solve it, so that I can get free heaven and earth, I sincerely hope! Sincerely hope! With this special wish for your peace, Shi Xiuying, August 6th.

Ms. Xiuying, we believe that the necessary conditions for the formation of marriage are emotional and legal, and neither is indispensable. You disapprove of the marriage contract of the rich family弟不务正业 arranged by your parents. If you have reached the legal age, you have the right to be autonomous. However, we dare not agree with you only knowing the law and ignoring family feelings. As for the boyfriend you admire, the marriage problem seems to be temporarily not considered, because before your engagement is resolved, this kind of remembrance will only increase the pain in your life journey. You should enrich your knowledge and devote yourself to your studies, so that you can build the foundation of your modern marriage and get a free world. By the way, we also want to sincerely advise the lady's parents not to admire the temporary vanity and sacrifice the lifelong chapter of your lovely children. The tragedy in today's families is due to the fact that parents did not make such reasonable considerations. I really don't know how many there are, I hope the lady's relatives pay attention to this!

### Cooling Powder One Dose

— Jue

Yellow vegetable leaves, fried with salt, only fill the stomach; if you are greedy for taste, will there be many troubles in the future?

Broken monk's robe, priceless treasure, patched up and patched up every year; a box of cages hide things for others, how often do you wear them to the old age!

Hardwood bed, soft grass mat, sleeping soundly without worry; brocade quilt and embroidered mattress cannot sleep, tossing and turning until dawn!

Old house, just sweep, repair it in time and it won't collapse; how many beautiful buildings have recently become rubble and green grass!

I appreciated the fan held by a friend during the banquet, and after reading the text on it, I recited it several times. I felt that it not only had a very thorough indication of life, but also a very accurate criticism of the current family. It was no different from taking a dose of cooling powder in the hot summer. I sincerely hope that readers will savor it carefully.

### Health Exercise Method (7)

The complete set of health exercise methods consists of 27 kinds of exercises. The 21st to 27th styles are the third group, which is the last group, and can be published in the next issue.

Health exercise is the simplest and most effective exercise. As long as you treat it as a daily lesson, proceed gradually, and practice without interruption, you will surely achieve the goal of ensuring health and enjoying the happiness of a healthy family.

The 21st and 22nd styles published in this issue function to give the often-neglected muscles and tendons of the waist a chance to move, and thus gradually become healthy and strong. As for the abdominal muscles and tendons and various internal organs, they also receive considerable benefit through the rotation of the body. When turning in a circle, the circumference should of course be as large as possible. When turning with legs crossed, do not let your shoulders and back touch the ground, keep your heels on the ground, and sit firmly on the ground with your buttocks, only turning your upper body in a circle.

Leaning forward will cause a hunchback. If you want to prevent or correct it, the 23rd style is the most effective method, because this exercise functions to change the habitually forward-leaning back muscles and tendons to lean backwards. When doing it, the head and both shoulders should be raised as high as possible, and do not touch the ground when turning left and right. The legs and buttocks must not move.

When doing the 24th style, as long as the hands and elbows are properly supported, it is not difficult to lift the body upwards. When the body position is appropriate, and you feel stable and comfortable, then you can stretch the legs up and down as you wish. Also, when stretching up and down, as long as you can maintain balance, it does not matter whether it is vertical or oblique. Also, when the legs return to their original position, the closer the knees are to the shoulders, the better.

(Figures 21 and 22) Sit upright on the ground, with both feet inserted into a fixed frame or leather ring, with both arms crossed in front of the chest. Turn the upper body to the right in a circle, and repeat six times. Count each complete circle as one time.

The 22nd style is to turn in a circle to the left, also repeating six times.

(Figure 23) Lie flat on the stomach, with the abdomen touching the ground, and both arms crossed behind the back. Raise the head and shoulders, and turn the body first to the left and then to the right. When turning, the head must be raised, and do not lower it to the ground. Repeat six times, counting each turn to the right as one time.

(Figure 24) From lying flat, raise both feet and buttocks, as shown by the dotted line in the figure. Support the body with both hands and elbows, raise both legs upwards, and then return to the original position. Repeat six times, counting each return of both legs to the original position as one time.

### A Week's Home-Style Menu

Last week, a reader, Mr. Wang Pingfu, wrote to ask about the method of making oxtail soup and country-style soup. These two were originally famous items in Western cuisine and are not found in home-style dishes. However, it is not impossible to make them to eat. For oxtail soup, first cut the oxtail into small pieces, add good soy sauce, and then put the chopped tomatoes into the pot and simmer until crispy. Country-style soup is another name for ten-vegetable soup. You can cut Chinese cabbage, carrots, lettuce, tomatoes, and other things into thin strips, and braise them all together with soy sauce. If you want to eat something substantial, you can add some shredded chicken or shredded beef. If you want a Western flavor, you must add butter, but butter is not easy to get now, so save it. Monday: Stir-fried chives with shredded pork, pan-fried tofu, winter melon soup with ham, stir-fried bean curd sheets with green vegetables

Tuesday: Vegetable beef soup, sweet and sour ribbonfish, stir-fried dried bean curd threads with celery, cold eggplant salad with sesame paste

Wednesday: Meatballs braised with Chinese cabbage hearts, dried shrimp eggs, vegetarian tofu soup, stir-fried purslane

Thursday: Curry shredded beef, steamed fish with fermented grains, stir-fried broad beans with sweet sauce, cold jellyfish with mung bean sprouts

Friday: Tofu braised with minced meat, sweet and sour salted yellow croaker, stir-fried gluten with loofah, fava bean paste salad with scallions

Saturday: Ten-vegetable winter melon soup, chives salad with egg skin, braised cabbage, stir-fried red cowpeas

Sunday: Stir-fried duck giblets, crab in batter, vegetarian ten-vegetable dish, celery salad
