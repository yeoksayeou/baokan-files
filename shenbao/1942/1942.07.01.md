### Egyptian War Situation Worsens; Tank Battle East of Mersa Matruh; Military Conference Held in Cairo

GERMAN HEADQUARTERS, 30TH (Haitong News Agency TELEGRAPH) - Mersa Matruh in North Africa was occupied by Axis forces yesterday morning, capturing over 6,000 British soldiers, destroying 36 tanks and many artillery pieces. More importantly, a large amount of war material fell into the hands of German and Italian forces. The 90th German Division made great contributions in the assault on Mersa Matruh. German and Italian forces are pursuing the defeated army and have reached the eastern part of Fuka. The German and Italian air forces bombed the roads used by retreating British troops and British defenses with great success.

ROME, 30TH (Haitong News Agency TELEGRAPH) - An Italian war bulletin stated that the Axis armored forces, advancing towards the British naval base of Alexandria, have reached the Fuka area and are now only 120 miles from Alexandria.

LISBON, 30TH (ALLIED NEWS AGENCY TELEGRAPH) - News from Cairo today states that German armored divisions in North Africa are attacking the British Eighth Army in an area of hundreds of square miles between Mersa Matruh and Fuka, 50 miles to its east, launching a tank battle unprecedented in North Africa. A Cairo communiqué released today has not yet confirmed that the Axis forces have advanced to the Fuka area, but the British Eighth Army is clearly in a difficult situation, trying to prevent the German forces from attacking the British naval base of Alexandria. The Cairo communiqué admits that Axis armored units and mechanized columns are advancing rapidly eastward. It is reported that Axis tanks and transport vehicles retreated on Sunday, but yesterday they departed from Mersa Matruh again and advanced again.

LISBON, 30TH (ALLIED NEWS AGENCY TELEGRAPH) - News of the fall of Mersa Matruh was officially acknowledged by Cairo last night. According to Reuters' embedded reporter with the British Eighth Army last night, "After Axis tank units and Allied flat-trajectory guns and field guns fought fiercely in the moonlight on Saturday night, the garrison of Mersa Matruh was ordered to withdraw to avoid being surrounded. The main force of the British army is retreating to new positions." However, the Axis forces are pursuing closely, forcing the British army to have no chance to dig trenches and hold their ground. Tank and artillery units have continued to fight fiercely for three days, and the situation is extremely fluid. Currently, German forces are attacking east around Mersa Matruh, while Italian forces are attacking from the west. The British side acknowledges that the war situation is becoming increasingly serious.

SWISS CAPITAL, 25TH (HAVAS NEWS AGENCY TELEGRAPH) - The Basler Nachrichten recently reported that the Allied Supreme Military Council held a meeting in Cairo last night to discuss ways to prevent Axis forces from continuing to advance towards the port of Alexandria. The meeting was presided over by General Auchinleck, Commander-in-Chief of the Middle East Forces. General Stone, Commander of the British forces in Egypt, General Wilson, Commander of the Ninth Army (stationed in Syria), General Kinnan, Commander of the Tenth Army (stationed in Iraq), General Kopanski, Commander of the Polish Army, Admiral Harwood, Air Marshal Tedder, General Maxwell, Chief Representative of the American Military Mission, and American Air Force generals all attended the meeting.

ISTANBUL, 30TH (Haitong News Agency) - According to information gathered here, the Egyptian Prime Minister, Nahas Pasha, convened a special cabinet meeting the night before last. Nahas Pasha repeatedly met with the British Ambassador to Egypt, Sir Miles Lampson, during the meeting. Political circles in Cairo believe that the cabinet will immediately decide on important measures. As the war is imminent, anti-British sentiment among the people of Cairo is increasing. Several Egyptian officers have been arrested for preparing to use force to prevent the British army from implementing a "scorched earth policy" if necessary.

British to Make Final Effort in the Battle for Alexandria

SOMEWHERE ON THE LIBYAN BORDER, 29TH (HAVAS NEWS AGENCY TELEGRAPH) - The war in North Africa has become the most important war wound in the current great war. The development of the war there is even more important than the war between Germany and the Soviet Union. It is historically unprecedented for Egypt to be attacked by the enemy from Libya. Britain can only hope that the Ninth Army stationed in Syria will quickly move to the western border of Egypt to support the Eighth Army. However, it takes several weeks to move troops, and the combat power of the Ninth Army is far below that of the Eighth Army. Therefore, whether the soldiers stationed in Syria can accomplish the work that the Eighth Army cannot do is extremely unlikely. The British General Staff has great hopes for American aircraft, especially dive bombers, to be transported to Egypt in time. However, American aircraft must fly through Florida, Brazil, British Guiana, and the Congo, and then to the Nile River basin. The journey is extremely long, and there are few supply bases along the way. Therefore, it is expected that Britain will make a final effort in the battle for Alexandria. The Axis forces have come across the desert, and the long journey will inevitably exhaust them. The British army, waiting at leisure, should be able to take advantage of this. Therefore, the battle for Alexandria is almost the only hope for the British army in the North African war. As for the Axis powers' operational plan, it is quite clear that once Alexandria is occupied, the British army will be completely driven out of the Mediterranean. The Italian fleet will be able to move without any obstacles. Malta and Cyprus will both surrender. German forces can land in Syria, and then launch an offensive, advancing into Iran, Iraq, and India. Among these plans, the plan to advance into India is not without difficulties, especially on the Iranian side, there will be many obstacles. However, it can be asserted that the army victorious in the Libyan desert will be able to pass through the mountains of Iran. Once the oil fields of Iran and Iraq are occupied, the Axis powers' liquid fuel problem can be solved. If this is the case, then the Caucasus will also be directly threatened. For this reason, the development of the war in Egypt is also directly related to the development of the war on the Eastern Front. The Soviet Union will do everything possible to prevent the German advance in Egypt. It is not impossible for them to send reinforcements to the Near East to assist the British army in combat.

ISTANBUL, 30TH (Haitong News Agency TELEGRAPH) - A communiqué from the Egyptian Ministry of the Interior states that Alexandria was bombed by Axis aircraft yesterday morning, suffering slight damage, but there were no deaths or injuries.

General Auchinleck Takes Command of the British Eighth Army

LISBON, 30TH (ALLIED NEWS AGENCY TELEGRAPH) - According to news from London, General Auchinleck, Commander-in-Chief of the British forces in the Middle East, has succeeded General Ritchie as Commander of the British Eighth Army in Egypt. British Prime Minister Churchill announced this today in the House of Commons, saying, "I do not intend to comment on the major battle currently taking place in Egypt today, but I feel that the members of the House should like to know that General Auchinleck decided on June 25th to personally take command of the Eighth Army, succeeding General Ritchie." Observers say that General Ritchie was completely unable to cope with the strategy of German General Rommel, causing the German army to occupy Tobruk and invade Egypt. At this stage, the appointment of General Auchinleck to command the Eighth Army will also prove that he cannot quickly change the current situation of the Egyptian war.

CAIRO, 29TH (HAVAS NEWS AGENCY TELEGRAPH) - Military sources here said that the war in Egypt is becoming increasingly fierce. The British Eighth Army is fighting a desperate battle along the Mediterranean coast against the fierce attacks of General Rommel's troops. The ferocity of the war is unprecedented in North Africa. The British Air Force, with the assistance of American aircraft, has repeatedly flown to Sollum and Mersa Matruh to bomb the Axis forces' transportation lines and supply stations. At the same time, the New Zealand Expeditionary Force has also joined the battle in Egypt. As for the fall of Mersa Matruh, responsible sources said that the Allied Command Headquarters, in view of the fact that the position was not important and the equipment was simple, did not want to deploy defenses and therefore voluntarily abandoned it.

SOMEWHERE ON THE LIBYAN BORDER, 29TH (HAVAS NEWS AGENCY TELEGRAPH) - Allied military experts generally acknowledge that after the fall of the fortress of Mersa Matruh, the position of the British Imperial forces in Egypt is in imminent danger. However, the fortress is not the last base for the British army to defend Alexandria. Some believe that General Auchinleck, Commander-in-Chief of the British forces in the Middle East, had included the abandonment of Mersa Matruh in his plan, in order to avoid the British armored forces, which had suffered heavy losses in Libya, clashing with the German armored divisions, which were superior in both quality and quantity. In general, the British army intends to delay the main battle as much as possible until reinforcements arrive before attempting to recover. Various reports confirm the accuracy of this statement. The problem currently facing the British military authorities is how to immediately transfer the Ninth and Tenth Armies to the battlefield. In short, what strategy the two armies' staff will adopt and whether the British army can retain Egypt will all be known in the next few days.

### Fixed-Term Withdrawals at the Central and Farmers' Banks to Begin on July 3rd

According to Domei News Agency, after the Japanese Army and Navy authorities entered the settlements, they sealed up four banks: the Central Bank of China, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Farmers' Bank of China, and dispatched bank investigators. As a result of the investigation, the Central Bank of China and the Farmers' Bank of China were found to have significant "enemy character," and it was decided to liquidate them. Regarding this matter, the Japanese Army and Navy authorities issued a proclamation on May 27th, designating the Yokohama Specie Bank to liquidate the Central Bank of China and the Bank of Taiwan to liquidate the Farmers' Bank of China, commencing liquidation immediately. Considering the interests of the depositors of the two banks, they are eager to pay out general old currency deposits. It is now known that it has been decided to commence the first withdrawals on July 3rd, in accordance with the following methods: (1) Amount: limited to 1,000 yuan (but the amount withdrawn from December 8th to May 27th is also included within the 1,000 yuan limit).

(1) Withdrawal ratio: 10% of the remaining balance after the first withdrawal (totaling 90% for the four withdrawals). (2) Withdrawal dates: from July 3rd, every day from 10:00 AM to noon.

### Rent Conversion Lingers and Unresolved, New Disputes Suddenly Arise: Landlords Propose Charging Public Utility Fees, Tenants Object and Await Resolution from Authorities

According to the English-language "Shanghai Times," while the Japanese Consulate General and the Asia Development Board authorities are organizing a special committee to study the rent issue, two real estate companies that initially insisted on converting all rents to Central Reserve Bank notes at a one-to-one ratio have proposed a new payment method to tenants. These real estate companies or rental agencies know that the relevant authorities are investigating this dispute and will issue regulations, so they are eager to reach a compromise with the tenants first. However, most tenants in this city hope that the landlords will convert rents to Central Reserve Bank notes at a 66% discount, and office and shop rents at a 50% discount.

Collecting Reserve Notes and Apportioning Miscellaneous Fees

A few days ago, a major real estate company notified its apartment tenants that, before the lease agreement expires, rent may be converted to new banknotes at a 66% discount. However, the company insists that tenants apportion public utility fees, elevator fees, and worker wages on a daily basis. Tenants whose leases have expired may continue to sign a three-month loan agreement with the landlord. Rent will still be collected in Central Reserve Bank notes at the original amount, or converted to new banknotes at a 66% discount, but must also apportion public utility fees, etc. Changes will only be made after the contract is renewed.

Public Utilities Should Not Be Charged

However, most tenants object to this rent collection method. While they are willing to pay rent in Central Reserve Bank notes at a 66% discount, they are unwilling to apportion public utility fees and elevator fees, etc., because in fact, several real estate companies have already converted rents to new currency at a 66% discount and do not collect additional public utility fees. At the same time, last winter, the landlords stopped providing hot water and heating without reducing the rent, so there is no reason to collect additional public utility fees. Moreover, now that the rent is converted to 66%, it is already 16% more than the officially stipulated ratio, and the increased amount of public utility fees, etc., can already be included.

Postponing Payment and Awaiting Resolution

Tenants whose contracts have expired or who have no contracts are highly suspicious of the point of renewing a three-month contract, because after the expiration of this contract, the landlord may increase the rent and collect surcharges. According to Chinese law, after the term of a contract has expired, the tenant must move out or agree to accept the landlord's proposal to renew the contract. At present, tenants whose contracts have expired or who have no contracts object to the method of adding public utility fees after the rent is converted to Central Reserve Bank notes at a 66% discount. However, most tenants prefer to wait until the authorities issue regulations before signing a new contract. In addition, most tenants have postponed paying rent and are awaiting a full resolution before paying.

### Establishment of the Boards of Directors of Tongren and Hongren Hospitals

Recently, the hospitals' Diao Xinde, Wang Yijing, and Shen Tongliang invited prominent figures from society to organize a board of directors, publicly electing Pan Tu as chairman, and Wen Lanting, Yuan Ludun, Wu Yunqi, Zhu Boquan, Tang Xinghai, and Zhao Jinqing as directors. They will also raise funds to provide medical consultations and medicine to help the poor and sick.

### Fellow Members of the Yuanyou Association Enthusiastically Assist in Education

Goodness Resides in the Human Heart, Difficulties Cannot Grind Away Intention
—— 本報第三屆讀者助學金昨有
——The Third Session of this Newspaper’s Reader Scholarship Fund received yesterday
New Underwear Company, Fellow Members of the Yuanyou Fitness Association, each donated 100 gold, totaling 1,200 yuan, and attached a letter expressing their purpose of assisting education. Between the lines, they revealed their loving and sincere intention everywhere, extending their own feelings to others, their intention is truly admirable. The original letter is transcribed as follows: "We have heard that the "Reader Scholarship Fund" established by your newspaper has achieved remarkable results. We cannot help but feel delighted. In this turbulent sea, there are still people who care for impoverished students and make great plans for cultivating talents, proving that goodness resides in the human heart, and that difficulties cannot grind away the chivalrous and gentle hearts of many people in the world. We are members of the inner circle, and we think that our cotton power is limited, so we cannot do great things. However, what is written is the same as what is done, so how dare we consider ourselves outsiders? Each of the twelve members of the Guo You (National Friends) have pooled together 100 gold, totaling 1,200 yuan of Central Reserve Bank notes, and sent it to your respected stage to help with this good deed. Although the amount is small, it is nothing more than the intention of "building a tower from grains of sand," doing our part on the hundred-mile beach. We hope you will accept it. Respectfully, the Yuanyou Fitness Association.

Yesterday's scholarships received included the following: New Underwear Company Yuanyou Fitness Association 1,200 yuan, Chen Xingcun 118 yuan, He Ruiyong 100 yuan, Qin Zhongliang 100 yuan, Jing Jiao 5 cents.

### Bureau of Public Safety to Close Today

The Bureau of Public Safety has issued a notice stating that all departments of the Bureau will be closed for one day on July 1st.

### Last Day of the Nutrition Exhibition

Yesterday was the second day of the Nutrition Exhibition held by the Shanghai YMCA. The weather turned clear, and the number of attendees increased. Today is the last day. It is heard that at 4:00 PM, Dr. Chu Linxun will give a special lecture on the diagnosis and prevention of typhoid fever. After the lecture, the YMCA's Youth Department will present a monodrama, which is expected to attract even more attendees.

### A Visit to the Nutrition Exhibition: Food and Nutrition, Diseases Arise Due to Insufficient Nutrition, the Main Principle Lies in Proper Coordination

In this current era of high prices, the dietary issues that people rely on for their livelihoods have already become extremely difficult. As for being particular about food and absorbing more nutrients to improve physical health, most people have even less time to consider it. However, since we are "born at the wrong time" and live in this turbulent era, our food, shelter, clothing, and transportation cannot be as comfortable and free as in the past, but maintaining physical health can be said to be a minimum requirement; moreover, in large cities like Shanghai, the facilities of hospitals and the number of doctors are still among the best in the country, but due to the lack of drug sources and the astonishingly high prices, if someone in a middle- or lower-class family is unfortunately ill, the huge medical expenses are truly difficult to bear. Therefore, preventing illness before it occurs is even more urgent. The most effective way to prevent disease is to strengthen the body's resistance, so that germs cannot invade the human body. In order to maintain and increase resistance, attention must be paid to the nutrients in food. The YMCA is holding a health and nutrition exhibition during this period and in this environment, which has profound significance.

Food Classification

The YMCA's health and nutrition exhibition opened on the 29th at the Eight Immortals Bridge Clubhouse. The reporter visited yesterday and saw various foods displayed on the tables, including five major categories: rice, grains, dried fruits, vegetables, and vegetarian dishes. The daily food needs of people. The rice category includes American rice, Saigon rice, Dulu rice, etc.; the grain category includes corn, cracked wheat, sesame, millet, red beans, soybeans, black soybeans, tea beans, broad beans, peanuts, etc.; the dried fruit category includes red dates, walnuts, etc.; the vegetable category includes pork, beef, mutton, pig liver, ox liver, sheep liver, pig heart, pig kidney, large yellow croaker, anchovies, cuttlefish, eggs, duck eggs, preserved eggs, chicken blood, milk, etc., the vegetarian dishes include alfalfa, red amaranth, celery, cabbage, spinach, green vegetables, tomatoes, onions, potatoes, cucumbers, eggplants, wax gourds, loofahs, radishes, sword beans, tofu, gluten, dried tofu, etc. Each food is displayed separately in a basin, with its nutritional value clearly marked; at the same time, it is clearly stated in large characters the diseases that may be caused by the lack of this nutrient in the body, so that people can see at a glance which foods are necessary for maintaining health.

Nutritional Components

The walls of the exhibition are covered with various charts, explaining the sources of several vitamins, the daily requirements of adults and children, the analysis of the nutritional value of several major foods, the symptoms of various diseases caused by a lack of vitamins, and the economical nutrition methods used to formulate diets and menus for children and workers for reference for three meals a day. Most noteworthy is the "student meal" prepared by the YMCA's student dining hall, displayed in the exhibition. A large plate of white rice, another plate of vegetables, and a bowl of soup are placed on a white plate. The vegetables are made of soybeans, spinach, night-blooming flowers, and sliced meat, and the soup is vegetable soup. It is said that the menu is guided by doctors to ensure that it is economical and contains sufficient nutrients, which is truly good news for young students at a time when food is expensive and dietary problems are difficult to solve.

Preventing Disease

In addition to holding health and nutrition exhibitions, the YMCA also hires doctors and experts to give lectures promoting public health, and cooperates with the Chinese Medical Association and the Chinese Health Association, with the Chinese Health Magazine publishing a special issue on nutrition, covering various health and nutrition issues such as children's nutrition and health, nutrition and disease prevention, vitamin deficiency and diseases, economical nutrition methods, bean nutrition, obesity and diet, etc. Experts were invited to write about the insights gained from their research and express them fully. The reporter combined the YMCA's intention to hold health and nutrition exhibitions with the opinions of various doctors and experts, and several major common concepts can be seen regarding food and nutrition, namely: Many diseases occur due to insufficient nutrition and must be prevented. Prevention is more economical and effective than treatment after illness.

Maintaining Health

Maintaining nutrition does not necessarily require delicacies or fish and meat. Even with vegetables and grains, proper coordination has the same value. Children are the future masters of the country, and their muscles and bones need to develop and grow. They must maintain proper nutrition in order to cultivate a sound physical foundation. Children's nutrition and health are closely related, and wise parents must not neglect them, so as not to affect family happiness and national health. In short, holding health and nutrition exhibitions in Shanghai at present has special significance and needs. People from all walks of life should rise up and implement them, and jointly promote them, so that the general public can at least maintain their physical health in a difficult environment. (Zhen)

### Six-Month Settlement Period: Increased Public Debt Transactions

The public debt market saw a continued firming trend yesterday, with a slight increase. Due to the upcoming two-day holiday, various financial groups were settling transactions, with both floating traders covering short positions and new funds entering the market. Covering was more prevalent. Prices briefly dipped but later rebounded. However, overall transaction volume remained sluggish, with major players mostly observing from the sidelines, temporarily refraining from action. Speculative trading was also absent. Most were awaiting the post-holiday period to determine their next moves. Yesterday's activity mainly involved inter-dealer settlements. At the close, prices uniformly rose by one to six jiao, with approximately 1.5 to 1.6 million yuan in transactions. A simplified table is listed below.

The first and second days of last month were bank settlement holidays, with the market closed for two days.

### Active Investment: Chinese Stocks Soar

The Chinese stock market situation yesterday, due to the upcoming annual settlement holiday for banks and money houses for the previous year, only operated for half a day in the morning. Market prices soared amidst unanimous investment sentiment, making a return difficult. Almost all transactions closed at the highest prices. Details are recorded below.

### Foreign Stocks Also Rise Sharply

Foreign stocks also rose sharply yesterday. The China Textile stock was particularly firm, with offers exceeding 423 yuan and no sellers. Ewo Cotton Mills rose from 42 yuan to 46-47 yuan by noon, also difficult to acquire. Sin Hua was at 37 yuan, Shanghai Wool at 16 yuan with limited supply. Shanghai Dockyards at 17.5 yuan, Shanghai Brewery at 13.5 yuan, and Shanghai Gas at 25 yuan were all highly sought after. Kailan Mining was priced at 38 yuan, and trams at 68 and 70 yuan, representing buying and selling prices, respectively.

### Banks Handle Semi-Annual Settlements: Check Clearing Delayed by One Hour, China Tobacco Company Joins Banking Association

Yesterday (June 30th) marked the bank semi-annual settlement period. The Shanghai Bankers' Association Joint Reserve Committee (i.e., the Check Clearing House), to facilitate check collection and settlement, specially extended the clearing time by one hour, starting clearing at 3:00 PM. The acceptance time for collection checks was not extended and remained as originally scheduled. Due to the government's implementation of price controls, bank business was generally quiet, while the accounting departments were busier handling settlement procedures. Today and tomorrow are holidays for banks and firms for semi-annual settlements. Business will resume as usual on the 3rd.

"Another dispatch" The China Tobacco Company's application to join the Banking Association as a member has been approved after review and will be admitted starting in July. The association distributed notices to member banks yesterday to process the application.

### Amidst Weakening Hardware Market, White Lead Wire Prices Rise Uniquely

The hardware market has gradually shown a downward trend in recent days. This is mainly due to the eagerness of囤户 (Speculators) to sell, the caution of buyers, and the government's impending price controls. Affected by multiple factors, the hardware market atmosphere is inevitably weak, and prices for various goods are gradually declining. However, the price of white lead wire is an exception. Due to the reluctance of囤户 to release stocks and the early depletion of local inventories, demand remains strong. As a result, the market is active, and sentiment is bullish. The standard quoted price has uniquely risen, with offers already at 1,000 yuan per市担 (Picul), and buyers still willing to absorb at 1,100 yuan. Discussions about original ton transactions are impossible due to the even greater scarcity of spot goods. Business at stores is limited to only one or two transactions, highlighting the strength of the market.

### Coarse and Fine Cloth Offers Relatively Firm: Prices Increase by Two or Three Yuan Per Piece, Few Sales Made

Factory Cloth Yesterday, the cloth market remained slow, but offers were relatively firm. Due to tight credit conditions, those散户 (Small Traders) who wanted to sell had already disposed of their stocks. As a result, prices for both coarse and fine cloths were raised by two or three yuan per piece, but few were willing to sell. 16-pound Earth Brand coarse cloth was priced at 180 yuan, 14-pound Flying Goose at 173 yuan, and 12-pound Earth Brand fine cloth at 160 yuan. New Singles were quoted at 155 yuan for Noble and 257 yuan for Peach Lady 士林 (Drills), and 145 yuan for American 士林 (Drills), with only a few transactions taking place.

Eastern Cloth Japanese trading companies continued to conduct business. It is heard that new singles of 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth were hovering between 186 and 187 yuan. Colorful Ball fine cloth was traded at a maximum of 167 yuan, and Four Gentlemen 哔叽 (Serge) at 17.15 yuan. The trading companies were eager to absorb, but other firms were unwilling to sell. Therefore, few transactions occurred. A formal market is expected after the reopening of the customs.

### Bean Market Shows Signs of Improvement: Dried Sweet Potatoes Sell Well

Beans Yesterday, there were slight spot arrivals. Local shops also selectively increased their acquisitions as needed, so the market showed signs of improvement. Transactions included 20 bags of Nanchiao soybeans at 202 yuan, 10 bags of Tianjin red beans at 173 yuan, and 70 bags of Chongming sand red beans at 170 to 168 yuan. 40 bags of sea silkworms were also sold at 105 yuan.

Dried sweet potatoes are scarce and sell well, and the market has turned bullish again. Yesterday, 25 bags of Shandong dried sweet potatoes were sold at 103 yuan.

Bean Cakes Nearby areas have slightly increased acquisitions, and holders' confidence has also strengthened, so prices are trending upwards. Transactions included 500 pieces of Lizi brand bean cakes from April's new crop at 58 yuan, 500 pieces of Shengji brand bean cakes from October's old crop at 50.05 yuan, 1,500 pieces of April's new crop at 53.5 to 56.5 yuan, and 500 pieces of June's new crop at 56 yuan.

The implementation of grain rationing in this city is imminent. The relocation of national rice managed by the 公司 (Company), the concession authorities have stopped issuing permits. As a result, the black market for national rice has disappeared. General peddlers have switched to selling inland flour at 125 to 115 yuan per bag.

### Daily Necessities: Matches and Soaps Relatively Popular

The market prices of daily necessities fluctuate erratically, causing operators to hesitate. The market remains dull, coupled with various unfavorable rumors, causing owners to temporarily adopt a wait-and-see attitude. Therefore, prices are firm amidst weakness. Transactions included Phoenix matches at 3,200 yuan, Beauty Brand at 3,300 yuan, miscellaneous brands at 2,400 yuan, Gu Ben soap at 300 yuan, Bai Xiangmao soap at 250 yuan, Huang Xiangmao soap at 190 yuan, and Arrow Knife soap at 155 yuan, maintaining good momentum. White Light 洋燭 (Candles) at 120 yuan, and Sengmao Brand at 115 yuan, without significant ups or downs.

### Sun Jinglu Discusses Theatrical Life: A Visit with a Stage Artist

— Lan Ying

Sun Jinglu is a promising theater artist. I believe anyone who has seen her perform would agree! This is our conversation.

"I wonder where Ms. Sun first appeared on stage?"

"I have loved acting since I was a child. When I was studying in Hankou, I often participated in various school talent shows or drama performances for disaster relief. Later, I formally started my theatrical life in Hong Kong with the China Travel Troupe."

"What kind of role do you like to play the most?"

"It's like this - I can't really say. All kinds of roles are the same to me - but I don't play them well." She said very politely.

"Based on your rich stage experience, do you think it's more interesting to perform tragedies or comedies?"

"I think tragedies are more able to capture the audience. Comedies often only make the audience laugh on the spot, leaving a very shallow impression. Moreover, comedies are very difficult to perform."

"Among many plays, whose works do you like the most?"

She rolled her eyes and smiled, "Cao Yu - I think others are the same as me - his lines are really easy to read, and the personalities of the characters he portrays are so moving. Not only is it energetic to watch, but it also feels comfortable to perform. - Most playwrights don't pay attention to this point. The characters they write are almost all the same, very vague; in this way, it is difficult for actors to grasp the personalities of the characters, and it is not interesting to perform."

"Do you often play billiards too?"

"No, every day after the play, I go home to play with my baby, read books and newspapers, and I no longer have any free time." After speaking, she introduced her baby to me, a one-year-old girl, very chubby, and even knew how to wink. When she is on stage, Binbao and housework are all taken care of by Sun's mother. Sun's mother is Jinglu's mother.

Sun Jinglu, who has become a mother, is only twenty years old this year, young and beautiful, but her conversation, thoughts, and attitude make even thirty-year-olds feel ashamed. Her life experience and knowledge must also be particularly rich, and there is no need to ask.

### After Watching Zhou Meiren

— Theater Customer

Because "Qiu Xiang San Xiao" was a success in Shanghai, Huang Guiqiu had the idea of ​​rehearsing "Zhou Meiren" Wang Laohu's Robbery of the Bride. In the past, the supporting roles were problematic at the 根斯新 (Geng Xin) Theater, and the performance did not come to fruition. This time, performing at the Golden Theater, the favorable location and harmonious human relations were suitable, so it officially premiered the other night. The new voice was initially tested, and the audience was full, a great success for a time.

"Zhou Meiren" is a complete comedy. People are tired of seeing the tragic stories of "June Snow" and "Yu Tangchun". Now, changing the taste and watching this funny "Zhou Meiren" is indeed a refreshing tonic for the nerves. In terms of plot and choreography, it is above average. The ending scene of "Concluding a Good Marriage" with Wang Yueying is able to remove the old writing style of "Bow to the Hall and Get Married" and change to an implied performance method, which is indeed Guiqiu's clever success. The distribution of roles is also very good at highlighting the main character. Guiqiu as Zhou Wenbin emphasizes acting over singing. In the past, people said that Guiqiu was better at singing than acting. Now, after seeing his Zhou Wenbin, it proves that he is good at both singing and acting. Furongcao's Chun Jie is an old hand, but unfortunately, her appearance is not good, and her costume is too old. Sun Shengwu's son is not very emotional and failed to attract attention. Li Shilin's Zhu Zhishan can be called a must, depicting the character realistically. Cheng Shaoyu, who plays Wang Tianbao, is energetic and has a high and bright voice, but his reputation is not as good as Yuan Shihai's, which is quite strange.

### Entertainment Scene

— Xin Juan

Zhang Shichuan's "Yan Gui Lai" has been completely completed, and a new work "White Angel" is being planned. As for the male and female leads, they are currently being sought.

Xu Xinfu is planning to start filming the fourth Chen Zhaoli detective film, tentatively named "Ancient Temple Annihilation of Thieves".

Tao Zou's adaptation of Bette Davis's Western film "Longing" has been named "Rebirth", which has been approved by the production meeting, and the protagonist is still to be decided.

Sun Jing's "Martyrdom" has started filming in the Third Factory, and Ma-Xu Weibang's "Cold Mountain Night Rain" has also been decided to start filming in the Third Factory.

The China Theater Troupe will withdraw from the Carlton on July 1st, and the location is temporarily undecided.

### Li Jianwu and Others Withdraw from the Theater World

— Yin Yan

When Rongwei Company was first established, because the directors and actors had to be organized, Li Jianwu, Zhu Duanjun, Zuo Lin and others were specially invited to maintain it. Now, it has been staged for nearly two months, and all aspects have been stabilized. Especially after performing great plays such as "Autumn", everything is on the right track, and the future development is very optimistic. However, now there is news that Li Jianwu and others are retreating after success and withdrawing from the theater world.

Originally, Li Jianwu and Zhu Duanjun were honorary directors of the company. They did put in a lot of effort for the troupe when it was first established. When the situation stabilized today, Zuo Lin was appointed as the director of the performance department to take regular responsibility. Zhu Duanjun was originally a very busy businessman, and Li Jianwu has recently changed his career to business for livelihood reasons and has temporarily decided to withdraw from the theater world together. Perhaps after the problems in life are solved, he will be able to devote himself to artistic work again.

Li Jianwu has already sent his family to live in Suzhou, and he himself will also travel between Beijing, Shanghai and other places along the railway in the near future. Of course, doing business is easier than working in the theater to cope with the serious problems of life. It may be a loss to the theater world. After Wu Ren's departure from the theater world, hearing the news of Li Jianwu, Zhu Duanjun and others withdrawing, I am afraid everyone has the same feeling!

### Lyrics of The Dreamer

Since the start of filming "蔷薇处处开" (Roses Blooming Everywhere), the work has been extremely intense. There are five famous songs, which are recorded at the main factory day after day, and the results are very beautiful. According to Chen Gexin, he is most satisfied with "The Dreamer". The lyrics are recorded below:

"The moonlight is so hazy, the earth is covered with night fog, where are you, my dreamer?

The sound of the tide rising in the distance, the gale is wailing, where are you, my dreamer?

A spring without roses is like a harp with broken strings; living in a world without love is like living a year in a day. The nightingale cries in the forest, tears are splashed on the grass, where are you, my dreamer?"

### Sharing the Same Boat Through Storms

— He Jiazi

(Six) A Snap of the Fingers

In just a couple of days, Weicheng got up early one morning and went to Shuangqiao alone. He put on the gray cloth gown that was folded as neatly as if it had been ironed. He didn't need to take a car, nor did he take any clothes to change as Guofang had instructed. When it was just dawn, he went to Mrs. Ye Er's room and said, "Aunt, I'm going to Shuangqiao. I'll be back in the afternoon. If I don't come back, it's because Guoqi kept me." He went to the Shuangmei Study to pay his respects to his parents' portraits. As he walked out of the wattle gate, the red sun in the east was red and big, rising slowly. He walked southwest on the road and, after a few steps, saw a woman with a hoe on her shoulder walking in front of him. Her back looked a lot like Cuizhen. Facing the morning breeze, he hurried forward, trying to rush in front of the woman. The woman suddenly turned her head and smiled: "Brother Yicheng, are you going to Shuangqiao? I asked you yesterday, and you said you didn't necessarily have to go. When did you decide? Was it after waking up from a nap?" Weicheng stood still and said, "I originally said you looked a bit like Sister Cuizhen. It turns out it really is Sister Cuizhen. Going to the fields so early." Cuizhen said, "Going to the fields is every day. Brother Cheng, you have to walk twenty 里 (Li) so early. I say you're too tired. You should take a car." Weicheng raised his foot and said, "What are these feet for? It won't take two hours to walk these twenty 里. "Cuizhen said," Mr. Guoqi is not at home. Will he be back in the afternoon?" Weicheng and Cuizhen walked side by side and laughed, "Sister Cuizhen heard me talking to my aunt. Hey, let's go together." Cuizhen seemed to think Weicheng was being impolite and asked, "Am I going to the Chen's house with this hoe on my back?" Weicheng said, "That doesn't matter. The hoe shows Sister Cuizhen's hard work in our house." Cuizhen said, "Don't joke. This has never happened before. When I go to Shanghai, there are some things I don't understand, or I even do them wrong. When Miss Chen asks me, I say, this is the rule in our village, this is how we do it. That can still fool people, like you, asking me to go to someone else's house with a hoe on my back, not only has Shanghai never seen this, but the countryside has never seen it either. There is only one thing: carrying a needle and a velvet rope can go anywhere." Weicheng laughed and couldn't answer. After walking past twenty or thirty 勝田 (Acres) of fields, Cuizhen reached her destination for cultivation and said goodbye, taking the hoe off her shoulder. (116)
