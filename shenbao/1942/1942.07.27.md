### The Summer Offensive is About to End; Germany Conducts Mopping-Up Operations; Consolidates Communication Lines North of the Don River Awaiting Opportunity for Large-Scale Offensive

Haitong Press, Berlin, 26th. This afternoon's German military communique stated: Southeast and east of Rostov, German forces fought fiercely to repel the enemy and have crossed the Don River. The enemy's attempt to establish a solid and orderly defense line on the southern bank of the Don River failed. German aircraft sank a Soviet gunboat at the mouth of the Don River and bombed two enemy oil tankers (6,000 tons) on the Volga River, both of which caught fire. They also sank three barges carrying military supplies on the Volga River. German and Romanian forces attacked enemy infantry and tank columns in the Don River basin. The vanguard has reached the Don River. In the Voronezh region, Soviet forces repeatedly attacked without success. A large enemy force was assembled northwest of the Voronezh region in preparation for an attack, but was subjected to large-scale bombing by our tank troops and air force, resulting in a complete rout. The enemy's counterattack was ineffective. Yesterday, a certain division of our army destroyed 48 enemy tanks with the strength of one division.

Allied Press, Stockholm, 26th. According to neutral observers in Stockholm, after the fall of Rostov, the German summer offensive will come to an end. They will rest for several days to clear the Rostov area and consolidate the lower reaches of the Don River to ensure the safety of transportation and communication lines before advancing into the Caucasus.

Allied Press, Lisbon, 26th. According to a German radio report last night, German forces advanced eastward from Rostov and captured Aksai. It was also reported that, to consolidate communication lines, Soviet forces on the north bank of the Don River have been mopped up, and the main German infantry force is deployed on the south bank of the Don River.

Havas Agency, Moscow, 25th. The Red Army General Headquarters has just released a military communique stating: On the "Rostov City" line, German tank columns and motorized infantry are constantly attacking, attempting to enter the city.

Haitong Press, Stockholm, 26th. According to news from London, the Soviet army's official newspaper "Red Star" stated that the situation on the southern front of the Eastern Front has experienced "amazing" developments. Soviet forces in the Rostov area are retreating continuously due to German pursuit. Soviet forces in the Tsimlyanskaya area have crossed the Don River in two locations. Although the Soviet forces launched fierce counterattacks, the German forces continued to advance aggressively.

Haitong Press, Berlin, 26th. German forces have occupied Novocherkassk, a city in the Don River basin that was an important city in the Don River region before the Russian Revolution. Kaledin commanded the anti-Red Army battles in the city from 1917 to 1920. The city is also a grain trading center and a wine production area.

### Comprehensive War Situation

Allied Press, Lisbon, 26th. Based on news from various sources here, after the fall of Rostov, the southern front appears to be shifting from Stalingrad to a vast area along the southern bank of the Don River.

Timoshenko's forces, originally in the lower reaches of the Don River, are now retreating to the east bank of the river and are urgently preparing new positions, also utilizing American aircraft in an attempt to mount a desperate defense. After launching an unprecedented major battle in Tsimlyansk, German forces have completely occupied the city. Elite German troops, having forcefully crossed the Don River and pursuing the defeated Soviet forces, are now advancing fiercely towards Stalingrad. In the past few days, although Soviet forces have repeatedly launched fierce counterattacks in Voronezh, they have all been repelled by German forces, and German forces are increasing their forces in that area. During the large-scale mobile warfare that suddenly began on the 25th in the Bryansk region, both German and Soviet forces deployed a large number of tanks and are currently engaged in fierce fighting. According to neutral observers, the Soviet military operation aims to alleviate the heavy pressure of the German forces on the southern front, thus attempting to contain them.

Allied Press, Zurich, 25th. Since the capture of Rostov by German forces, their vanguard units have turned their attack towards Stalingrad, so the Don River operation can be said to have ended, becoming a new situation of direct attack on Stalingrad. The situation in that area is gradually becoming serious. The outcome of the battle there is not only of decisive importance to the German-Soviet war, but is also a stage related to the entire European war situation. Therefore, the Soviet situation is causing extreme anxiety and impatience for the Allied nations. Since the Soviet army has deployed the newly formed reserve army under Marshal Voroshilov in that area, and still cannot stop the German offensive, or is being defeated, the Soviet army will feel the lack of necessary troops in continuing the war in the future. Furthermore, the cultivation of Soviet resistance, with the Caucasus isolated due to German control, has fallen into complete isolation. If German forces advance into West Asia, the Allied blockade against Germany would be completely broken. Furthermore, according to a cable from Ankara, the Soviet side, in preparation for land traffic between the Caucasus and its mainland being cut off, has requisitioned all oil tankers and other ships sailing in the Caspian Sea, and it is reported that the Soviet forces operating on the Caucasus front have begun to prepare for withdrawal, and that preparations are being made to destroy the equipment of the Maikop oil fields.

Haitong Press, Berlin, 26th. In the week ending on the 24th, the German army and its allied forces on the southern route of the Eastern Front achieved a decisive victory in the major offensive. The entire Donets Basin, its coal mines and factories, have been completely occupied by German forces. Several days ago, German forces crossed the Rostov-to-Stalingrad railway, the only railway connecting the Soviet Union to the Caucasus and the Persian Gulf. At the same time, oil from the Baku oil fields also relies on this railway for transport to the Soviet Union. From now on, it can only rely on shipping on the Caspian Sea. Navigation on the Volga River is now also threatened by the advancing German forces. The city of Rostov fell on the 24th. Soviet forces repeatedly attempted to defend their positions, but were unable to maintain them due to the fierce attacks of the German army and air force. Large Soviet forces either collapsed and fled or were annihilated. German forces have crossed the Don River east of Rostov to cut off the retreat of Soviet forces south of Rostov. After the city of Voronezh was occupied by German forces on July 7, Soviet forces launched 40 fierce attacks in five days in an attempt to recapture it, but were either repelled. General Zhukov, commander of the Soviet Central Front, launched several counterattacks north and northwest of Orel in early July, but all were ineffective, losing 600 tanks. German forces continued to mop up the remaining enemies behind the Central Front, achieving great success. Southeast of Lake Ilmen, Soviet forces in the Volkhov and Leningrad areas also launched repeated attacks, but were all repelled.

### Cripps Broadcasts to the United States; Rejects Gandhi's Demands

Allied Press, Lisbon, 26th. According to news from London, Sir Stafford Cripps recently broadcast to the United States, stating that India's demand that Britain immediately abolish its rule over India cannot be allowed. Cripps also said, "I have always regarded Gandhi as a great leader of the Indian people and religion, but in the current situation, he cannot show that he is a practitioner." Cripps is afraid that the threat of Indian leaders will gain the support of the masses and hinder Britain's war effort.

Havas Agency, London, 25th. The Lord Privy Seal, Sir Stafford Cripps, delivered a speech to the "British Association" today, reviewing the post-war world economic structure, briefly stating, "After the end of the current war, all countries in the world, especially the 'Allied countries', should immediately formulate an international regulation that provides for the production and distribution of raw materials. It is expected that the large-scale wartime economic institutions of today will be transformed into 'good institutions' after the war. Whether it is Britain or any other country, they cannot attempt to regard themselves as a special nation to other peoples. Our belief lies in hard work and adherence to the Atlantic Charter. In essence, the world's natural resources are extremely abundant, and if they can be distributed equally among all nations, it will be enough to maintain life without fear of scarcity. In short, all nations in the world have the right to share the world's resources. In the past, Britain failed to use its resources reasonably, which is what we must openly acknowledge. Therefore, we need to use new methods and new organizations to realize the principles contained in the Atlantic Charter."

### Fighting in Voronezh Region Intensifies

Havas Agency, Stockholm, 26th. After the German forces occupied Rostov and Novocherkassk, the focus of their offensive has shifted east from the southern route. Currently, the German forces are still conducting mopping-up operations around Rostov. The fighting in the Siverskyi Donets region is the most fierce. The German forces have crossed the Don River, but the nature of the German offensive has changed in the past few days. In other words, there is no longer a simultaneous advance of large armies on a broad front. Now only assault teams are advancing separately, and their main force is clearing the resistance of the Red Army remnants. According to German sources, it is not expected that there will be any surprising news before the end of this war. The strongholds occupied on the left bank of the Don River are only a base. Under the current circumstances, it is not enough to constitute the starting point for the German forces to launch a new offensive. The Red Army is resisting strongly south of the Don River. The German offensive on Stalingrad has been particularly fierce due to the Red Army's resistance. There is no doubt that the Red Army General Headquarters is determined to defend the narrow strip of land between the Don and Volga rivers at all costs. For this reason, the German forces are currently attempting to widen their gap, and will launch a large-scale offensive as soon as the opportunity arises. The fighting in the Voronezh region is intensifying. The German forces stationed in that area are still acting according to their planned plan, so that they can participate in the Volga River War. The German side claims that the Red Army has suffered heavy casualties and heavy losses of military equipment in that area, including 2,200 tanks and 2,400 field guns. In addition, there is a new factor worth noting, namely the Red Army's advance towards Bryansk. According to Soviet sources, the Red Army's progress is very smooth. Soviet armored troops have broken through German positions and cut off enemy communication lines. This matter is still in the development stage, so a conclusion cannot be drawn rashly. It is speculated that its purpose is to force the German forces to disperse their strength in order to relieve the siege of the Red Army on the southern route. A Swedish newspaper commented on the Eastern Front situation today, saying, "The German forces launched an offensive on the Eastern Front and drove straight in. They will inevitably encounter difficulties in supply. If the Red Army concentrates on the north bank of the Don River, it is true, then the German forces will have to postpone their advance, so that the German Commander-in-Chief can transfer a large number of reserve troops to the area to reinforce. But in the next few days, it is expected that the German forces will launch a large-scale offensive on Stalingrad and the south bank of the Don River. Once this happens, the war will begin again.

### Germany Intensifies Preventive Measures in Occupied Areas; Military Exercises Held in Northern France; British Workers Urge Opening of a Second Front

Haitong Press, Berlin, 26th. According to military sources here, preventive measures at stations in the occupied areas of France, Belgium and the Netherlands have been intensified. Ordinary people who want to enter and exit train stations must have special permits.

Haitong Press, Berlin, 26th. According to military figures here, German forces have been conducting exercises in northern France for several days. All kinds of units participated, and a final review was held. The generals were very satisfied with the superiority of the German tactics and the strength of the morale.

Havas Agency, London, 25th. Four thousand five hundred British munitions factory workers sent representatives to the Prime Minister's official residence on Downing Street today to petition Prime Minister Churchill, advocating the immediate opening of a second front, saying that failure to do so would only lead the Allied nations to failure. The workers pledge to work day and night without rest to increase production, so that we can win on the second front.

Haitong Press, Stockholm, 26th. According to news from London, in the last 24 hours, the pressure on the British government to immediately open a second front has increased. This development seems to be an organized movement. Prime Minister Churchill and other cabinet members have received letters requesting the opening of a second front. There have also been mass rallies and demonstrations in London and other places demanding the opening of a second front. London political figures believe that the government may take action, but they also acknowledge that the Eastern Front situation is deteriorating. According to the military reporter of the London Times, the southern front of the Eastern Front is about to be resolved quickly. Although General Timoshenko has led his troops to break through, the Don River basin has fallen into the hands of German forces, and Stalingrad is increasingly threatened.

Havas Agency, Zurich, 26th. Regarding the issue of opening a second front, the New York Times published an article commenting, "Soviet Ambassador to the United States Litvinov did not ask the United Kingdom and the United States to immediately open a second front when he met with President Roosevelt this week. His argument is very clear, and there is no need to insist on this proposal. Especially since President Roosevelt himself is already preparing to take this action, but in making this important decision on military strategy, he does not want to ignore the opinions of his military advisors. The British and American Joint Military Committee is drafting a plan to provide effective assistance to the Soviet Union before it is too late, but according to military experts, there are still many difficulties to overcome. Britain does not want to risk another major setback, this is one. The difficulty for the United States lies in the transportation problem, this is two. But the territory that the Soviet Union has given up in order to gain time is expanding day by day. If the German army can cut off the Red Army and lose contact with the Caucasian states, then the communication between the Soviet Union and its allies will also be interrupted. Based on this, if a second front is not opened in Europe or Africa, the United Kingdom and the United States will be in danger of being isolated.

### Admiral Leahy Resigns as Ambassador to France

Havas Agency, Washington, 25th. The White House recently issued a communique stating that Admiral Leahy has resigned from his post as Ambassador to France, and President Roosevelt has approved it. Because Admiral Leahy has been appointed as Chief of Staff, but technically, he is still the Ambassador to France, so he had to submit his resignation. In his reply, President Roosevelt praised the achievements of Ambassador Leahy, saying, "Your Excellency has performed the most difficult work in an extremely delicate environment. The people of the whole country are impressed by your achievements, and during your tenure as Ambassador to France, our country's policy towards France was full of understanding." It is expected here that the government will not appoint an Ambassador to France for the time being, and the duties of the embassy will be temporarily assumed by the Charge d'Affaires Duke.

### German and British Armies Await Reinforcements; Another Showdown to Take Place; Only Air Battles and Artillery Battles Yesterday; Mussolini Meets with Rommel

Allied Press, Lisbon, 26th. El Alamein has been subjected to air raids by the British army for a week in order to cut off German transportation and reinforcements. On this day (Sunday), air battles and artillery battles took place. The British electricity slightly gained the upper hand, but General Rommel still remained undisturbed by the protection of landmines and the like. Since the German army carried out a delay in the Alamein area, the Egyptian war suddenly proceeded and stopped. In fact, there was no change in the front line, because both sides were waiting for reinforcements to arrive before another showdown.

Havas Agency, Rome, 25th. Italian Prime Minister Mussolini recently went to the North African front for inspection. The details of his visit have been officially announced, roughly stating that Prime Minister Mussolini held an important meeting with the commander-in-chief of the German-Italian Allied Forces in North Africa, and went to visit injured soldiers' hospitals and Italian villages.

### There Was an Important Meeting in Cairo

Cairo, 25th (Havas) – British Commander-in-Chief in Palestine, General Barker, has concluded an important meeting in Cairo with the British Middle East military authorities and has returned to Jerusalem.

Ankara, 26th (Haitong News Agency) – According to sources in Jerusalem, the British Governor of Palestine has ordered a ban on people approaching military or civilian airfields in Palestine, following acts of sabotage near hangars and supply depots.

Istanbul, 26th (Haitong News Agency) – According to sources in Cairo, approximately 1,400 people have been arrested in Egypt in the past four weeks and are being sent to the Duer concentration camp in the Sinai Peninsula.

### Britain and America Engage in Political Activities

Vichy, 15th (Havas) – In the past period, German forces have been advancing steadily on the southern sector of the Eastern Front, attempting to strike directly at the Caucasus and seize its rich oilfields. However, Britain and the United States seem to be neglecting military affairs and focusing on international political activities. This is the feeling of political observers here. The recent speeches by British Foreign Secretary Eden and U.S. Secretary of State Hull did not mention the war, but focused solely on outlining a plan for future peace, which is strange. However, while British and American politicians are concerned about the future world, the Soviet people must consider the present reality. On the 22nd of this month, Soviet Ambassador to the United States Litvinov visited President Roosevelt for a long talk, and Soviet Ambassador to Britain Maisky also met with British authorities. Their purpose was solely to urge the British and American authorities to consider the harsh realities of the present. Now that the German army has occupied the Don River basin, British and American aid to the Soviet Union is even more urgent. Eight weeks ago, when Molotov visited London and Washington, Britain and America promised to help the Soviet Union, but a second battlefield has not yet been opened. Will this ever happen? Observers here believe that this issue will be the focus of Soviet-British and Soviet-American talks, and its importance will far outweigh the issue of resource allocation. In short, international observers believe that since Britain and America have turned a deaf ear to the Soviet Union's call to open a second battlefield, it remains to be seen whether the Soviet Union can continue to fight alone. Regarding this point, there have been various speculations, including rumors that the Soviet Union is preparing to negotiate peace as soon as the German army enters the Caucasus. However, this statement has been denied. As of now, the fierce fighting between Germany and the Soviet Union is intensifying and there is no sign of ending. As for the Polish issue, it is rumored that negotiations between Britain, America, and the Soviet Union have resulted in an agreement. It is said that the Soviet Union has given up its demand to place the border within Polish territory, that is, to abandon the so-called Curzon Line of Polish territory. The Soviet Union recognizes Poland's restoration to its pre-World War II territory, which is a major concession to Britain, since Britain's entry into the war began with the Polish issue. However, since the Don River is still in German hands, the so-called border is still just a proposal.

### Turkish National Assembly Scheduled to Reconvene and Vote on a Motion of Confidence

Istanbul, 25th (Havas) – The National Assembly is scheduled to reconvene on August 7, at which time the government will submit a motion of confidence for a vote. Prime Minister Saracoğlu will also deliver a speech to the Assembly, the main points of which will be: 1. Continuing to pursue a policy of absolute neutrality, treating all Allied countries and friendly nations equally, and striving for cordial relations. 2. Restoring a free economic system within the country. Since Saracoğlu took office as Prime Minister, the Turkish economy has gradually changed. For example, since the authorities allowed free trade in wheat and raised prices, Turkish agricultural income has increased by £15 million, and free trade in various foods has been restored, resulting in a uniform drop in the prices of various commodities.

### Large Numbers of American Troops Arrive in Iraq to Undertake Defense Responsibilities

Stockholm, 26th (Allied News Agency) – According to a report from Ankara, large numbers of American troops have recently landed in Basra to take on defense duties. British troops stationed in Iraq have largely gone to Egypt as reinforcements, and Soviet troops have also moved from the Caucasus, so the defense of Iraq has been handed over to American troops. At the same time, Iranian troops sent abroad have been recalled to the country to take on the real power of defending the country. A U.S. military delegation recently arrived in Tehran, attempting to guide the reorganization of the Iranian army.

### Australia Will Restrict Alcohol Consumption

Saigon, 26th (Haitong News Agency) – News from Melbourne yesterday stated that accidental incidents involving drunkenness have occurred frequently in Australia recently. Therefore, 90,000 people in Victoria have petitioned the government, requesting that the authorities strictly enforce laws regarding alcohol. The Australian government is paying close attention to restricting the business hours of alcohol sales in order to increase the people's efforts in the war. Therefore, it is prepared to reduce current alcohol business hours by at least two hours. The Australian government will also grant special powers to state governments to prevent the danger of frequent incidents of drunkenness.

### Direct Flight Between Tokyo and Rome – Lieutenant Colonel Moscara Deli Completes 9,000 Kilometer Journey

Rome, 26th (Haitong News Agency) – According to Haitong News Agency correspondent Michaelke, Italian aviator Lieutenant Colonel Moscara Deli flew from Rome to Tokyo and then back to Rome. The wartime bridge between the Axis countries has been completed. Italian reporter Guido and others have strongly argued that this flight is useful for the joint operations of the Axis powers. The route taken by Moscara Deli has not been published, but after the Axis powers occupied Crete and Burma, the distance between Japan and Italy has been reduced from 13,000 kilometers to 9,000 kilometers. After World War I, Lieutenant Ferrari first flew between Japan and Italy in an old-fashioned biplane. This time, Moscara Deli flew in a Macchi-Castoldi aircraft without wireless equipment and could not receive weather reports. Moscara Deli is an aviator who has crossed the Atlantic 22 times. His companions this time were Major Codo, Captain Maggeni, Lieutenant Masotti, and Officer Gonzales. When they flew back to Italy, they landed at a port in central Italy. Mussolini and party, government, and military dignitaries, the Japanese and German military attachés, and Admiral Abe, the leader of the Japanese naval delegation, were all at the airport to welcome them. At that time, Colonel Cassero, the head of the Document Section of the Italian Air Force, read out letters from the Japanese Army and Navy Ministers to Mussolini through Moscara Deli. The letters stated that the Japanese people praised the feats of the Italian aviator. Mussolini also praised Moscara Deli's success and shook hands with the dignitaries present, then left the airport amid cheers.

Rome, 26th (Haitong News Agency) – Last night, the front pages of Italian newspapers carried the news of Italian military Lieutenant Colonel Moscara Deli's round-trip flight from Rome to Tokyo with huge headlines. "The Voice of Italy" supplemented the official communique, saying that the plane arrived at an airport in central Italy at 7:55 p.m., but did not reveal when it returned to Italy. The pilot was warmly welcomed by Prime Minister Mussolini after returning to Italy, who kissed him on both cheeks. The pilot is 37 years old this year and has been a famous Italian military aviator since 1928. He served as a member of the Italian Air Force delegation to Brazil and participated in the Spanish Civil War. He has won one gold medal and two silver medals.

### Chilean President's Speech on Foreign Policy

Santiago, 25th (Havas) – After President Ríos arrived at the port of Valparaíso, the municipal authorities of the port held a meeting to welcome him. President Ríos delivered a speech on the spot, stating that Chile's economy is currently in a difficult period due to the impact of the world war. In terms of domestic and foreign affairs, the difficulties are far greater than in peacetime, so we need to cope with determination, effort, and sacrifice. In terms of diplomacy, according to the Constitution, the President is responsible for leading foreign policy and does not allow others to interfere. Since our country is one of the countries of the Americas, the destiny of the continent is closely related to our country, so we cannot stand idly by. Therefore, I dare to assert that our government will never take any action that harms the Americas. If our country must change its attitude, it must be within the interests of the Americas. This point is also fully endorsed by the Senate.

Santiago, 20th (Haitong News Agency) – According to the Chilean Minister of Intelligence, the warm welcome of President Ríos in Valparaíso is an expression of support for his policy of neutrality. The city is the second largest city in Chile, and the citizens lack interest in politics. This welcome to the President is due to support for the policy of neutrality.

Santiago, 25th (Havas) – Chilean Army Commander-in-Chief General Escudero recently met with Foreign Minister Salva to report on his recent visit to Brazil, Paraguay, Uruguay, and Argentina with a military delegation. The Chilean military delegation went to Brazil at the invitation of Brazilian Army Commander-in-Chief Mendelo.

### Suez Canal Stock Prices Fall

Vichy, 25th (Havas) – The Panama Canal was built solely for the benefit of the United States and is purely an American matter. The Suez Canal, on the other hand, is an international waterway, almost the hub between East and West, so it is very important. At this moment, the war is threatening Egypt, causing the Suez Canal's stock to suffer a major impact on the international stock market. For example, on the Paris Stock Exchange, the current price of Suez Canal stock is 25,000 francs per share, which is about the same as the pre-war price, but in reality, it can be seen as a drop in stock prices, since the prices of various industrial stocks have more than doubled compared to pre-war levels. In theory, the Suez Canal is neutral, but when the League of Nations sanctioned Italy for its invasion of Abyssinia in 1936, the canal's neutrality was violated. However, its special status prevented Britain from opposing Italian ships passing through the canal, which helped Italy succeed in its attack on Abyssinia. When the current war broke out, the neutrality of the Suez Canal became empty talk. After Italy declared war, it could no longer use the canal. For the supply lines of Britain and the United States, the Suez Canal should be placed under wartime law. The Axis powers have repeatedly issued statements threatening to attack the canal, but so far, traffic through the canal has never been interrupted. However, as a result of the Mediterranean war, the Suez Canal has temporarily lost its past significance, meaning it is no longer a major commercial route. The cessation of commercial activity has forced the Suez Canal Company to stop paying dividends to its shareholders. In 1938, no fewer than 6,000 merchant ships of all sizes passed through the canal, with total tax revenue reaching 100 million francs. The board of directors then decided to use a net profit of 91.5 million francs as a dividend for shareholders, with each share receiving 900 francs. In short, the world's largest canal is currently facing an unprecedented crisis, but its future fate will depend on the outcome of the current war.

### German Long-Range Artillery Shells British Convoy

### Javanese Sugar Factories Recover

Tokyo, 26th (Allied News Agency) – The Javanese sugar industry has always been an important agricultural resource in the East Indies. Of Java's total population of 40 million, 5 million depend on the sugar industry for their livelihood. The annual sugar production often reaches about 14 million tons, 90 percent of which is exported to various places. Before the war, the Dutch Indies government had engaged in sabotage, but after the Japanese army occupied it, with the active cooperation of the natives, production was quickly restored in a very short period of time. Currently, due to low wages, sugar prices are also quite cheap, so if it is transported to various places in the East Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere, there is no need to worry about a shortage of sugar consumption. The National Sugar Industry Experiment Station near Surabaya is very large and has made many contributions in the past. All the staff, including the director, have vowed to continue their efforts, so the future of the Javanese sugar industry is quite promising.

### Mysterious Egypt (3)

Geographical Overview

At the beginning of World War I, Egypt also joined the Allied forces alongside Britain. At that time, the flag representing Egypt was two-colored, with a yellow center and a blue stripe. This flag accurately represents the topography of Egypt and is very similar to the color of Egyptian soil. Because eastern Egypt is the Arabian Desert, western Egypt is the Libyan Desert, and in between is the Nile River valley. It is truly unique in the world to have such a fertile area in the midst of two great deserts.

All of Egypt's glory is in the Nile River valley, and the population is concentrated there. The total area is about 388,000 square miles, but the Nile River valley is only the size of Belgium, while the population is over 4 million, concentrated there. So if you only talk about the population density of this area, it is even greater than that of the most densely populated Netherlands and Belgium in the world.

However, the vast desert is not entirely insignificant. The so-called desert is by no means entirely sand and yellow mud. There are also occasional oases and clear springs that provide resting places for herders and tourists. There are also high mountains and giant rocks that regulate the monotony of this sandy source. Moreover, in the desert, because the atmosphere is thick, the light often bends and creates many illusions. For example, it is common to see inverted trees and camels in the desert. Mirages are also common, often leading travelers to initially believe that there are clear springs and grasslands ahead, only to realize that they have been tricked. During World War I, a team of over a thousand British soldiers fell for the illusion and disappeared.

The color of the desert is not entirely uniform. In the Assouan area, it is gray, while near the Delta, it is white. Moreover, it changes with the sunlight, its color changing thousands of times from morning to night, truly a magnificent sight. Those who have seen the sunrise and sunset in the outskirts of Cairo, especially in Fayoum, will surely say that it can be compared to the sunrise over Mount Tai.

The desert is not without economic value. You only need to look at the newspapers in Cairo or Alexandria to often see news of the discovery of oil and coal mines. Although later official personnel investigated and proved that the discovered mineral resources were too small, or the quality was not good, or there was nothing at all, but judging from this phenomenon, there will always be real discoveries sooner or later, and there will not be no achievements.

The treasures in the desert include gems, rocks, sodium and phosphorus compounds, soda, and salt. The red bricks of Assouan, the building stones produced in Helouan and Sohag, and the rubies of Jebel Zabara are all very famous. The sodium and phosphorus compounds produced in Kena are mostly used for cultivation. Most of Egypt's salt is produced in Lake Mariotis, where the people divert water into shallow waters and wait for the hot summer sun to dry it. In autumn, they harvest the salt and then introduce Xiang water, making salt production very convenient.

The illusions in the desert mentioned above can often be seen in general travelogues. In the Nubian Desert between southeastern Egypt and Abyssinia, tourists and travelers spend the whole day as if they are among lakes. In fact, these lakes are formed by the reflection of the surrounding high mountains by light. Those who see it for the first time always think it is real, because such mirages are always detailed and realistic. If you see the water rippling in front of you, the surrounding trees and grass fluttering, and birds flying, would you say it is fake? It is said that during the last war, a team of over a thousand British troops fell for a mirage, lost their way, and disappeared without a trace. According to optics, the illusion in Nubian is of the Inferior type, a "model". In addition, there are also Looming, Lateral, and Towering types, which are less common in Egypt.

Another miracle in the desert is the sandstorm. Huge tornadoes are often encountered, and for a time, sand and rocks fly, with the power to move mountains and overturn seas. The tranquility of recent battles is also due to this.

An Arab poet compared the Nile River delta in Egypt to an open green folding fan, with the city of Cairo as the carved and gilded handle, the Nile River as a long golden ribbon, and the oases in the desert as several green embroidered balls hanging from the fan.

An oasis is a special place in the desert. There, there may be natural springs or artificial wells and rivers, so cultivation is possible in the oasis, but the arable land only accounts for one percent. Most oases produce dates and olives, and most residents rely on them for a living.

### Jing'an Temple Buddhist Academic Lecture Series

The abbot of Jing'an Temple, Dewu, and the supervisor, Mika, have initiated a series of Buddhist academic lectures, which is the first initiative of temple lectures. Mr. Ding Fubao was invited to give the first lecture yesterday, with over 500 people in attendance. Mr. Ding is tireless in learning and teaching, and repeatedly expounded the importance of Buddhism to life, as well as methods for health and longevity, integrating Buddhism, medicine, and science, and proving it with his own decades of cultivation. The main points of the lecture were divided into sleep, diet, clothing, bowel movements, deep breathing, exercise, sex life, cleanliness, residence, work methods, mental health, dealing with people, and meditation, and concluded with wholeheartedly taking refuge in Buddhism. The listeners were all delighted and believed. Mr. Ding's lecture notes will be compiled and printed by Jing'an Temple in the future to make them widely available. The second lecture will be held on August 2, given by the elder Buddhist layperson Fan Gunong on Buddhism and Life, from 9:00 AM to 11:00 AM.

### In Honor of Mr. Ding Fubao

Tranquil, Enlightened, Optimistic, and Wise

Tranquility, enlightenment, optimism, and wisdom are clearly one of Mr. Ding's personality traits. He said, "Living in seclusion, a bowl of porridge is enough to fill my stomach, vegetables are enough to suit my taste, cloth and cotton are enough to keep me warm in winter, children and grandchildren are enough to entertain my old age, servants are enough to answer the door and sweep, a small house of a dozen rooms is enough to shelter me from the wind and rain, seven or eight old friends gather every seven days at the beginning of the cycle to break the loneliness and provide mutual benefit, and fifteen or sixteen thousand volumes of books are enough to spend my leisure time and help me review the old and learn the new. This kind of quiet life, in the midst of the mundane world, is not envied by the world, but I already feel that I have enjoyed it too much." Mr. Ding also used to host a porridge gathering, once a week, called the "Star One Society." The society "does not value empty formalities, does not welcome guests, does not see guests off, there is no distinction between guest and host, sitting and standing are unordered, straightforwardness is the agreement, simplicity is the tool, porridge instead of rice, water instead of tea, chatting about ancient and modern times, quietly enjoying calligraphy and painting, not talking about right and wrong, not discussing official matters, standing, sitting, and lying down, forgetting the form and enjoying oneself, a quiet family style, the elegance of forests and springs, a moral friendship, just like that. Arranging stinky carpets, maneuvering and arranging, the inside is not sincere, the outside is vain and hypocritical, one concern is interests, and they look at each other with animosity. This is vulgar communication, which I reject."

His family management also adopts "liberalism." He opposes using "oppressive policies" because he himself grew up in a family filled with free air. He does not feel a strong interest in art. He gave an example: "Many people like to fit beautiful curtains in the room to let the sunlight sneak in. I don't want to use curtains, let the sunlight shine directly on the bed. I don't like using curtains, but I don't hate curtains that are bad."

Hand-Created Hongqiao Sanatorium

Mr. Ding's courtesy name is Zhonghu, which was written for him by Mr. Wu Zhihui. He also recognized that he would spend his life with mathematics, hiding among the people making calculations, and gave himself the pseudonym Yinju Jushi, taking the meaning of Tao Yuanming's poem, and named his room "Yi Wu Lu." He is from Wuxi, and his family was originally from Changzhou. At the end of the Yuan Dynasty, they moved to Wuxi, becoming a famous family in Wuxi. He was born on June 22 of the thirteenth year of the Tongzhi era of the Qing Dynasty (1874 AD). He came to Shanghai to study medicine at the age of 28, and began practicing medicine at the age of 35. He stopped his medical career at the age of 58. Over the years, in addition to practicing medicine, he buried himself in writing, producing hundreds of works, which is a spectacle. At the age of 61, he hand-created the Hongqiao Tuberculosis Sanatorium, adding a unique color to the Chinese medical community. The following year, he resigned from various positions outside and devoted himself to reading behind closed doors, but he still spared no effort in donating and assisting various charitable causes.

The above is a brief overview of Mr. Ding Fubao's personal life, beliefs, personality, and career. As for the scope and achievements of Mr. Ding's 50 years of writing, as well as his early years of diligent study, another comprehensive introduction and explanation will be made.

### Bandit Executed for Killing Hostage and Two Officers, Another Sentenced to Life Imprisonment

Two kidnappers, Chang Rong and Wang Xuetang, both from Anhui province, gathered a gang last November and kidnapped Wang Jigao, a wealthy banker from Zhenjiang, in the Public Concession. They forced him into a car and drove through the intersection of Avenue Joffre and Rue Ferguson in the French Concession. A French officer, No. 104, and a Vietnamese officer from the French police noticed the car speeding and suspected something was amiss. They stopped the car for inspection, but Chang, the bandit, opened fire, killing the hostage, Wang Jigao. He then continued to fire, killing the two officers. The French police received the news and immediately dispatched a large number of detectives to pursue and capture the two bandits, Chang and Wang. The rest of the gang escaped. After repeated investigations, the police handed Chang and Wang over to the French court for detention and trial. The case has been ongoing for a year, with multiple hearings that have now concluded. Yesterday, the court announced the verdict: Chang Rong was sentenced to death for murder and deprived of his civil rights for life. He was also sentenced to ten years for extortion by kidnapping, to be served concurrently with the death penalty, with deprivation of civil rights for life. Wang Xuetang was sentenced to life imprisonment for kidnapping and extortion, with deprivation of civil rights for life. After the sentence was pronounced, they were returned to custody to await the appeal period before the sentences are carried out according to law.

### Mei Lanfang, After Five Years in Hong Kong, Flew Back to Shanghai Yesterday from Guangzhou; Mrs. Mei, Children, and Friends Greeted Him at the Airport

Since this newspaper published the news of Dr. Mei Lanfang's itinerary, the Mei residence on Route Massenet received three telegrams one after another yesterday morning. Besides one sent by Mei's friend, the other two were from Mei himself, informing his family of his departure from Guangzhou and Taipei. Therefore, it was almost certain that Mei would arrive in Shanghai yesterday.

### "The Plane is Here!"

Those who left the Mei residence on Route Massenet to greet him at the airport included his wife, Ms. Fu Zhifang, his daughter Bao Yue, and his youngest son, Bao Jiu, as well as a few relatives and friends. Arriving at the airport early, Mrs. Mei and the others had some cold drinks in the dining room. Before she could finish a glass of soda, someone suddenly shouted, "The plane is here!"

At this moment, "Xiao Jiu" - Mei Lanfang's youngest son, nine years old - was the happiest. He and his sister ran ahead. Their eagerness to see their father was more sincere and heartfelt than that of the relatives and friends.

Mrs. Mei's pace seemed quick. Holding a folding fan in her hand, she pointed the fan at a three-engine postal plane with two huge wheels, which had already landed, and spoke to her children.

Slowly, the giant C-1502 Guangzhou plane turned and taxied towards the runway in front of the air station. The wings were still roaring. Everyone ran towards the plane to greet their "distant guest." Mrs. Fu Zhifang's eyes sharpened, already catching sight of her husband through the window. She waved the delicate little fan, and Bao Jiu and Bao Yue followed suit, waving their fans.

The wings stopped spinning, and the wheels came to a standstill. Workers placed the boarding ladder and opened the cabin door.

### The Nervousness of "Revealing His Face"

Mrs. Mei, her children, and Dr. Mei's friends all stared, waiting for his "appearance" with the same nervousness that fans of Mei's art feel when the stage is struck a few times or the qin player strums a "prelude" before waiting for him to "reveal his face."

What? The first one out was a young man with the air of an athlete; the second looked like a physical education instructor; the third... five, six, seven... there were also two or three ladies, but no Dr. Mei. Mrs. Mei's eyes widened, and "Xiao Jiu" and "Xiao Yue" became impatient. Ah! Their father was hiding in the back, appearing only as the twelfth or thirteenth person.

Dr. Mei Lanfang, the owner of Zhui Yu Xuan, who had been away from Shanghai for more than five years, finally emerged from the plane's cabin at around 4:40 PM. He bowed slightly, a smile on his face, holding an umbrella and a raincoat in one hand and a blue canvas bag in the other. He descended the short ladder calmly.

His wife and children went forward first. Nine-year-old "Xiao Jiu" was the most well-behaved, quickly taking his father's umbrella and raincoat. Another friend took the blue travel bag. Only then did Dr. Mei free his hands to shake hands and exchange greetings with the welcoming friends.

### "We've Picked You Up Three Times!"

"Oh dear, we've been waiting for you for over a month, and we've picked you up three times!" This was Mrs. Mei's first sentence to her husband after seeing him again after more than a year.

"I'm old...same to you." This was Mei Lanfang's humble remark to a friend he hadn't seen in five or six years.

If we were watching a foreign movie, what kind of affectionate "shot" would there be of this couple, who, although not separated for a long time (a little over a year), had repeatedly changed their travel plans? But they were respectful to each other. After saying a few words, they were busy greeting others.

Mei Lanfang's gentle elegance and graceful demeanor were still the same as before, except that his face was thinner and he had a short mustache. One friend said that with the umbrella in his hand and the short beard on his lips, he looked like Chamberlain when he stepped off the plane. Dr. Mei smiled in response.

He wore a light yellow suit, a white shirt, a striped light blue tie, and white suede shoes with flower patterns. He wore black sunglasses.

Mrs. Mei was dressed beautifully, wearing a fuchsia striped cheongsam with a black background and off-white leather shoes. Her plump face was even fuller than before. Her handbag was made of new green and white squares connected together, somewhat symbolizing the "Zhui Yu Xuan" (Jade Assembling Pavilion).

### Returning to the Mei Residence from the Airport

After claiming their luggage in the station building, everyone sat down in the dining room. Dr. Mei talked about his journey, very relaxed. He found it rather boring to have been stranded in Guangzhou for nearly two weeks while waiting for the plane. It is clear that while his friends in Shanghai were impatient with his repeatedly changing itinerary, he personally felt the same way in Guangzhou.

It was not until five o'clock that everyone left the airport.

Mei Lanfang got into the car with his children, looking very happy. "Xiao Jiu" carried his father's umbrella on his shoulder, making him even more endearing. His facial features were very similar to those of Mei Lanfang twenty years ago, and he will surely be welcomed by the public in the future.

Returning to the Mei residence on Route Massenet, everyone felt a little tired, mainly because the weather was too hot. The car took more than three-quarters of an hour to get from the airport to Route Massenet via Y育学会路, Sichuan Road, Nanjing Road, the Great World, and Avenue Joffre.

### Away for More Than Five Years

Mei Lanfang performed in Shanghai in the spring of 1937 and then went to Hong Kong, where he stayed for more than five years. During a casual conversation, he said, "I've lost a lot of weight recently. My best weight was about 155 pounds, but now I've lost about 20 pounds."

"I stayed at the Ai Qun Hotel in Guangzhou. I made phone calls almost every day to inquire about flight schedules, or asked others to inquire."

"I originally planned to leave Guangzhou by plane at around 3:00 PM yesterday (the 25th), spend the night in Taipei, and then come to Shanghai this morning (the 26th). (Yesterday's newspaper reported that I would arrive in Shanghai at 1:00 PM, which was based on this plan.)"

"The Guangzhou plane departed at 9:00 AM this morning and arrived in Taipei at 1:00 PM, stayed for an hour, and then flew to Shanghai at 2:00 PM."

"When the war broke out in Hong Kong, my residence was hit by stray bullets several times, but fortunately I remained calm and was not greatly shocked."

### Needing a Long Period of Rest

Finally, regarding Mei's arrival in Shanghai, there have been various rumors outside, some saying that he will return to the stage. However, according to him, he has not been in good health recently and needs a long period of rest. He will just let the rumors spread, etc.

In short, Dr. Mei is 49 years old this year and has a short mustache. His past has already been established. Perhaps in a few years, people will call him "Old Dr."

### Mei Lanfang Arrives in Shanghai from Hong Kong

Dr. Mei Lanfang, who was rumored to be flying to Shanghai several times, arrived in Shanghai at 4:30 PM yesterday. Those who went to Shanghai Airport to greet him were his wife, children, and several friends. Mei looked slightly thinner, but his demeanor remained the same. Apart from a short mustache on his lips, he had no other changes. After a short rest at the airport, he returned to the Mei residence on Route Massenet with his family and friends. The left picture shows (top) Mei Lanfang's recent style (bottom) Mei and his wife, Ms. Fu Zhifang, and their children.

### Shanghai Underwear Industry to Organize a Trade Association

The Shanghai Underwear Industry Trade Association is for the manufacture and sale of underwear. It was initiated by eighteen businesses including the New Light Standard Underwear Factory, New China Underwear Company, Zhonghui, and Yongxin. It has been approved by the authorities and issued Permit No. 161. It is said that Mr. Chuan Liangjun of New Light has been selected as the director of the preparatory committee, and Chen Hanquan, Li Guangchi, Xu Kaixian, Pan Liping, Yu Junheng, and Xu Derong are the preparatory committee members. The association's address is temporarily located at No. 7 Weiwenfang, Zilai Street. All businesses are welcome to join.

### Christian Summer Retreat

The Christian Summer Retreat will be held from July 27th to August 1st at the Xie Jin Middle School at the intersection of Jing'an Temple Road and Hart Road. The speakers and times are: Miss He Shouying's spiritual retreat from 8:45 AM to 10:00 AM, Pastor Lin Daoliang's sermons from 10:15 AM to 11:30 AM, and Mr. Qian Guoyun's spiritual cultivation from 6:00 PM to 7:30 PM.

### Gu Fei's Painting Exhibition

Ms. Gu Fei's personal painting exhibition has opened on the second floor of the Women's Bank. The exhibits are all carefully constructed works, including landscapes, female figures, figures, and flowers. The landscapes, such as "Jiangnan," are rendered with unrestrained brushwork, capturing the essence of Shitao. The blue-green landscapes capture the essence of Tang Dynasty techniques, with an antique flavor. The female figures mostly benefit from Zhou Fang's "Standing Exhausted at Dusk," and also have the spirit of Six Dynasties statues. Others, such as the long scroll of water, are full of smoke and clouds, and their skill rivals that of nature. There are also inscriptions by Qian Mingshan, Chen Dingshan, Chen Xiaocui, and other masters, which are particularly valuable. Art lovers should not miss this exhibition.

### Miscellaneous News from All Circles

Vita Rich Company: Mr. Bao Wenxin of Minhou studied chemistry in the United States at an early age. He uses scientific methods to produce various vitamin foods, such as Vita Rich malt flour, yeast, soy milk powder, and maltose, which provide nutrition for children and are suitable for post-illness nourishment. The materials are of excellent quality, surpassing imported products. Since the factory was established and put into trial operation two years ago, it first produced a children's nutritional product, malt flour. In less than two years, it has become popular throughout Shanghai. Now, it has increased its capital and expanded its scope, and has been renamed Vita Rich Chemical Refining Company. All kinds of vitamin foods that have been successfully trial-produced will be manufactured and sold one after another to meet market demand.

People's Clinic: The weather is hot, and the number of people suffering from epidemic diseases has suddenly increased. The People's Clinic, hosted by Dr. Zhou Shouxiang and physicians Zhu Yeqiong and Zhou Wenxiang, provides free medical consultations and dispenses essential medicines as appropriate. Therefore, a large number of people have been going to the clinic for treatment in recent days. The address of the People's Clinic is located upstairs of the Sino-Western Pharmacy at Xin Zha Bridge.

### Fried Rice with Oil (2)

— Da Jun

### Sketches of Hotel Employees' Lives

Those who are excessively muddleheaded and absurd are surprisingly quick to perish. Often, a year ago, they were still good people, strong, capable, and valued. A year later, they are nobodies that no one cares about. I have seen several such examples. One became addicted to opium and developed sores all over his body. He could not work and became a nobody, and soon died. Another opened a room for gambling, hired women from the escort agency to sing ditties, and ran out of money. He started stealing, and was eventually caught and imprisoned for three months. When he was released, no one would take him in, so he became a nobody. There was another who became addicted to heroin...

None of them doesn't love to gamble. They like to gamble at Pai Gow, thinking that playing mahjong is not exciting enough. Some gamble whenever they have money, gambling it away and waiting for more money to come. Others don't gamble on weekdays. Not only do they not gamble, but they are also very thrifty. They feel bad if they spend an extra dime. They work hard all year long, saving a considerable sum of money. Around the end of the year, they have a big gamble with others. It's a miracle that they will bet the entire stack of banknotes without hesitation, not thinking about how much effort they put in and how much hardship they endured to earn that stack of banknotes. No, they don't think about it at all. Then a card is turned over, and they lose. The entire stack of banknotes is taken away. Their face turns red, and their eyes seem to be spitting fire, but they bet another stack of banknotes... After the end of the year, they have lost all their savings and owe people a lot of money. They have to work for two months for free to pay off their debts.

Are they fools? Are they stupid people? Yet they are sometimes very clear-headed.

"It's really sinful to think about it!" one fried rice eater said to me. "I usually can't even bear to buy peanut candy. It's very expensive. Money has to be earned with effort. But when someone calls out, 'Aitang, eight rounds, eight rounds!' I immediately follow them, as if I'm being urged by a ghost."

Here are two similar interesting stories:

One afternoon, around two or three o'clock, a fried rice-eating friend said to me, "I will never gamble again! If you ever see my hand touching the cards, you can scold me as a "turtle bastard!""

That very night, I saw him playing mahjong with a flourish.

There was another who, after losing all his money, cut one of his fingers to show his determination never to gamble again. But before the wound had healed, he had lost all his money again.

They also have hobbies. Do you believe it? Listen to me -

They are mostly young, and there are not many over thirty years old. They are young and working hard all day long, so they are very strong, with arms as thick as beer bottles.

Some say that life is like climbing a ladder. Taking the process of eating "fried rice with oil" as an example, this is very true. A thirteen- or fourteen-year-old child is sent into this industry and begins his busy and arduous life. After suffering for several years, he becomes a "Number Three Coal Stove." If he progresses, he becomes a "Number Two Coal Stove," "Number One Coal Stove," and even the boss. But this is such a difficult ladder to climb! There is a long distance from one step to another. To climb one step, you have to endure torment for a long time. Moreover, climbing from apprentice to boss is really easier said than done!

Therefore, it is rare to find one out of a hundred apprentices who can become a boss. Many apprentices can't even climb to the position of Number Three Coal Stove because they can't stand the persecution of a hard life and need to make adjustments. Whenever they have the opportunity, they gamble a little and buy some snacks to eat. As mentioned above, they have no money, so it is easy to get into debt. Once in debt, it is simply impossible to repay - only to add to it. As a result, they can't help but steal a little. Once discovered, they are cursed by everyone and suffer a terrible fate from then on.

Okay, even if you become an employee, you are not necessarily happy, but you can breathe a little easier. The employees have all been apprentices and have endured a lot of time. Now they think they can really have some fun, so nine out of ten are muddleheaded and absurd. The remaining one is at least partly muddleheaded and absurd. As for those who are not at all muddleheaded and absurd and can live a life of integrity and seriousness, I don't know of a single one.

Every morning, when it is still hazy, they get up. Sleep is not something worth lingering over for them. Of course, the fact that the place to sleep is not good is also a reason. Those who have wives naturally sleep at home and get up later. Those who don't have wives, whose homes are often in the countryside, sleep naked in the store. The dormitory is usually a small attic (even worse than a garret. People inside can't even straighten their backs), where five or six people live together. As for the furniture, there are no tables or chairs. There are only a few wooden cabinets, one for each person, to put a few simple clothes and some odds and ends. When it's cold, they are also used to store bedding. In hot weather, the bedding is not needed and is pawned. In addition, there are a few mats, one for each person, rolled up during the day and leaning against the wall. At night, they are spread out on the floor to sleep on. If it's in the summer, they just flop down and fall asleep in a moment. There are countless bedbugs, mosquitoes, and fleas, but no matter how badly they bite, they don't care. In winter, they have to take the bedding out of the cabinet again. There is definitely not much bedding. In severe cold weather, there is only one quilt and one mattress, at most adding a cotton coat on top of the quilt. Sleeping like this is naturally not very enjoyable. As long as they can recover from their fatigue, what do they care about sleeping? Moreover, their energy is strong, and activity is what they need. They can't understand why good people sleep all the time, or they think it's bad luck. Okay, I won't go on. After they get up, a dozen or so people go to the sports ground together. The so-called sports ground is mostly a rooftop water tank or a larger patio. The main sports equipment is the immortal's load (i.e., a stone dumbbell), which comes in several types: 250 pounds, 150 pounds, and 100 pounds. The second is a stone lock, weighing 50 pounds and 30 pounds. Besides that, there is nothing else. Don't underestimate these things, they are not cheap, costing several hundred dollars. This money is divided among everyone, twenty or thirty dollars per person. I said earlier that they also have "hobbies," which refers to this. For example, some people like to collect stamps. This is a "hobby." They are willing to spend money to buy old stamps that are generally considered useless. Another example is that some people love antiques. They are very fond of a broken night pot with mottled colors, saying that it is antique. This is also a "hobby." A "hobby" is an intuitive interest. You like something, you just like it. You definitely don't think about "what are the benefits after liking it" first and then like it. As for the fried rice eaters buying stone dumbbells, the motivation is also an intuitive interest. You see them taking turns lifting the stone dumbbells, so interested, so serious, holding their breath, their faces flushed, lifting the heavy stone dumbbells upwards again and again. The more times they lift it, the better, because there are many people watching. They have strength, and this strength should always be shown, so lifting stone dumbbells is a good way. As for saying that they are lifting stone dumbbells to make their bodies stronger and their muscles stronger, I'm afraid not. They are already very strong and very sturdy. Or, if they have this idea, it is very vague.

### Shanghai Banking Industry to Provide Industrial and Commercial Loans in the Western District to Support Industry and Commerce and Increase Production

Due to the recent surge in population, the industrial and commercial sectors in the western district of Shanghai have shown a prosperous scene. New types of industrial and commercial sectors are constantly increasing. In order to regulate finance in the western district and expand business, banks, money shops, and silver firms have set up branches in the western district, which has become common. In particular, since the Central Reserve Bank established an office in western Shanghai, the importance of finance in western Shanghai has become even more apparent. It is understood that the Shanghai banking industry, in view of the prosperity of industry and commerce in the western district and the hope that it will be even better in the future, but considering that it is somewhat difficult for industrial and commercial firms with slightly weaker funds to maintain their businesses, plans to use idle funds to provide as much industrial and commercial loans as possible in the western district to support the recovery and prosperity of industry and commerce. All industrial and commercial firms applying for loans, if they are indeed used to increase production, have sufficient collateral, and obtain a reliable guarantee, will be granted loans.

### Everyone Riding Vehicles Outside the Concession Must Have a Epidemic Prevention Certificate

According to the English "Times" newspaper, it was learned yesterday that in the future, anyone riding vehicles of the Huazhong Public Bus Company in the suburbs of the concession must present their cholera vaccination certificate. This measure is the last step taken by the authorities in the epidemic prevention campaign inside and outside Shanghai. Those who fail to present their vaccination certificate will be refused to ride the public bus.

Since the discovery of real cholera in this port, those taking buses from Shanghai to various stations on the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou lines must carry epidemic prevention certificates issued by the health departments of the two concessions. The same applies to those taking ships from Shanghai to other ports, otherwise they will not be allowed to disembark or go ashore.

### What are the Benefits of Fire Insurance Companies?

— An

Monthly premium income of 400,000 yuan is only enough to cover expenses. What are the principles of underwriting capacity?

The business methods of fire insurance companies are divided into underwriting risks and collecting premiums, and using premiums to invest in other businesses. So, how much insurance coverage can a fire insurance company with 1 million yuan of capital underwrite?

According to general principles, when accepting insurance coverage, fire insurance companies must first divide the buildings on a certain area of land into individual risks. For example, the houses on the north side of Aiduya Road, from Yu Qiaqing Road in the east to Chongqing Road in the west, each house (assuming there is a door number) is considered a risk. Among them, for each risk, if the building has ten-inch brick walls on all sides and a tile roof, and its interior is used as a shop, then a fire insurance company with 1 million yuan of capital can retain approximately 30,000 yuan of insurance coverage (i.e., can underwrite the house or the property inside it). If the building has board walls on all sides and the interior is engaged in small-scale industry, then its retained coverage cannot exceed 5,000 yuan. If the building is made of reinforced concrete and is equipped with fire-resistant doors and windows and various fire prevention equipment, then a fire insurance company with 1 million yuan of capital may be able to increase its retained coverage to 50,000 to 60,000 yuan. Generally speaking, it is only around 20,000 to 30,000 yuan.

If a fire insurance company has 25 brokers, each with 100 policyholders, and each policyholder has a house, then the fire insurance company has a total of 2,500 policyholders, which means it bears 2,500 risks. If the average retained coverage for each risk is 30,000 yuan, then the total retained coverage for 2,500 risks is 75 million yuan! Now, assuming the most common premium for every 10,000 yuan of coverage is 49.5 yuan per year, deducting the broker's commission of 20%, it is reduced to 39.6 yuan. Therefore, the total premium income for 75 million yuan of retained coverage is 297,000 yuan.

According to historical statistics, fire insurance claims are approximately half of the premium income. Subtracting half from 297,000 yuan leaves 148,500 yuan. This is the premium income for one year. Dividing it by month, the fire insurance company earns an average monthly profit of only 12,000 yuan on the retained insurance coverage.

Reinsurance is Most Important

A fire insurance company with 1 million yuan of capital has a retained coverage of approximately 30,000 yuan for each risk, but the business it receives often exceeds this amount. Therefore, at the beginning of establishing the company, in addition to raising capital, the most important thing is to find a reinsurance company and enter into a reinsurance contract with it. Reinsurance for which a contract is signed is called excess-of-loss reinsurance.

In the past, if the founders of a company had credibility, status, or the company itself had a considerable background, it was not difficult to find a strong company to reinsure it. However, in the current extraordinary period, it is not easy to find a reinsurance contract for 500,000 to 600,000 yuan (referring to each risk).

If a fire insurance company cannot obtain a reinsurance contract, it absolutely cannot operate. Moreover, judging from the current situation, in order to win over brokers and compete for business, general fire insurance companies abuse special allowances, sacrificing the commissions that should be earned on insurance. Therefore, even if they can obtain a reinsurance contract of 500,000 to 600,000 yuan, it is actually only benefiting the reinsurance company and the brokers.

In a fire insurance company in good condition, the commission earned on reinsurance premiums is at most 5%. For example, if a fire insurance company has 25 brokers, each with 100 policyholders, the company has 2,500 businesses. In addition to underwriting a retained coverage of 30,000 yuan for each business, it also obtains reinsurance coverage of 500,000 yuan. Now, if the reinsurance coverage of 500,000 yuan is obtained for 2,500 businesses, then the total reinsurance coverage obtained by the company is 1.25 billion yuan. If the reinsurance premium is also calculated at 39.6 yuan per 10,000 yuan per year, then the total is 4.95 million yuan, approximately 400,000 yuan per month. However, this is the reinsurance premium, which is collected on behalf of the reinsurance company, and at most, a 5% commission is obtained. In other words, only a 20,000 yuan commission is obtained for collecting a premium of 400,000 yuan per month on behalf of others.

According to the current situation, the monthly expenses of a fire insurance company with 1 million yuan of capital, including rent, utilities, employee salaries, printing paper, stationery, and everything else, are at least 30,000 yuan. However, as mentioned above, the monthly premium income, after deducting the reserve for claims on the retained coverage, is 12,000 yuan; the commission on the reinsurance premium of 400,000 yuan is 20,000 yuan, totaling 32,000 yuan. A company that can collect more than 400,000 yuan in premiums is actually rare, and this more than 400,000 yuan in premiums is only enough to cover expenses. If it cannot collect 400,000 yuan in premiums per month, maintaining the business becomes a problem.

Concentrated Risk is the Most Dangerous

The most important principle of a fire insurance company is that the risks (businesses) it accepts must be dispersed. Therefore, the coverage on a certain risk (i.e., a certain house) is absolutely limited. It should not be greedy for excessive business. For example, if the value of the property in a house is 1 million yuan, a fire insurance company with 1 million yuan of capital can only underwrite 530,000 yuan (including the retained coverage and the contractual reinsurance coverage). It absolutely cannot accept 540,000 yuan or 550,000 yuan, otherwise, it will be concentrating the risk in a certain house and violating the principles of fire insurance business.

Insurance is not gambling, which is a matter of course. Fire insurance companies have strict restrictions on the coverage of a certain risk, but there is no limit to the number of risks. As mentioned above, if a fire insurance company has 25 brokers, each with 100 policyholders, then the company has 2,500 dispersed risks. The more dispersed risks, the better; the fewer concentrated risks, the better. Judging from the current situation, fire insurance companies often have excess coverage for a certain risk, but they cannot obtain business for risks elsewhere. This is a major problem in the operation of fire insurance companies.

### Market Trends

Government Bonds

Both government bonds and Chinese stocks showed a turnaround last week. The bond market has been falling for a month, and the stock market has been rising for two months. It is not unexpected that one has reached its extreme and is about to recover, and the other has reached its peak and is bound to decline.

The decline in the bond market came to a standstill on Friday. Except for the Unified C bonds, the trend turned for the better across the board on Saturday, especially for the A and E bonds. This was because there was a sudden rumor in the market on Friday about the issue of principal and interest repayment. Whether this is true or not is unknown, but it is a common phenomenon after a continuous decline. The greatest practical significance of this phenomenon is that it implies that the bullish side has begun its counterattack. Although the credit crunch remains, the outcome remains to be seen.

Chinese Stocks

Chinese stocks have been smooth sailing, rising continuously for more than two months. Moreover, the trend is tight, which is unprecedented. Indeed, the vigorous emergence of new companies has inevitably increased the shortage of circulating chips, and the contraction of currency is not yet the reason why speculative funds have decreased.

However, stock prices ultimately cannot deviate from their true value and simply rush forward. As a result, all the hot stocks are at their peak, and the search for unpopular stocks is also subject to various restrictions and directly chased. As of today, everyone has a feeling of being "too late to enter." This feeling is deeply rooted in people's hearts, and the market has become stagnant. Once the trend stops, selling follows, and a reversal is seen. However, based on the current objective situation, this change is likely to be just a temporary pause in the rising trend.

Yarn and Cloth

At the beginning of the week, the yarn and cloth market was extremely quiet, and the price of each grade of goods rose by three or four yuan at one point. However, people's hearts are weak, and no one is interested. In addition, market rumors are complicated, and hoarding is regarded as a dangerous path. It then fell back down. However, the winter clothing fabrics have already begun to be prepared in this street, and the eastern fabrics also occasionally rise in small waves, which is a bit of vitality.

### Ways of Celebrating a Birthday

— Editor

Life is but a few decades, and because time is short, it feels even more precious. Since it is precious, it seems especially worth commemorating. So, I am not against celebrating birthdays; even if I am, it is useless. What I think we should pay attention to is the way of celebrating birthdays: what should be opposed is unnecessary waste; what should be promoted is using the birthday celebration to increase the birthday person's value in life.

Mr. Ding Fubao's way of celebrating his birthday, I think, is enough to be a model for us. Although Mr. Ding said that he himself "does not celebrate his birthday when he is alive, and does not hold a memorial service when he dies," for the sake of his life value, he "cannot not celebrate his birthday when he is alive, and cannot not hold a memorial service when he dies." It's just that the way he celebrates his birthday and holds his memorial service is different from the worldly customs. Usually, there are some people who make the world suffer more for every year they live longer; and make relatives and friends suffer more for every birthday they celebrate. The reason for this is precisely because their lives are meaningless and their lives are valueless. So, we are not against celebrating birthdays, but we want to promote meaningful birthday celebrations, and then change the way of daily life, increase the meaning of life, and the value of life.

Mr. Ding uses his birthday celebration to benefit orphans and help impoverished students. We think that the more birthday celebrations of this kind, the better. There is no shortage of enlightened and well-known people in society, and we hope that everyone can follow in Mr. Ding's footsteps and continue to promote this, making it a good habit.

We would like to offer these few simple words to wish longevity to Old Man Ding Shou!

### Parasites

— Song Daren

The term "parasite" is such a shameful thing. It is only because it cannot make a living independently and must rely on other organisms to maintain its life. Parasites in humans are a disgrace to humans; however, it is not glorious for humans to be parasitized by parasites. Because humans ultimately have glorious ideas of upward mobility, since the mid-nineteenth century, they have worked hard to find solutions to the problem of parasites in the human body. Over the past hundred years, they have indeed made many amazing achievements. The pain of diseases in the human body has indeed been alleviated a lot, and humans ultimately do not want to be ashamed for a long time.

There are many parasites in the human body. There are about one hundred and fifty species that are already known. Among them, about fifty species are more common and important. Their entry points are mostly through the mouth and nose, but it is not uncommon for them to sneak in through the muscles. Hookworms and Japanese blood flukes are well-known facts, so wading barefoot and farmers plowing have the opportunity to be invaded by them.

If we do not know or understand, and are confused, we will naturally not know how terrible they are. If we have a little common sense, we cannot help but be afraid. For example, tapeworms can grow to more than three feet long, and broad fish tapeworms can sometimes grow to more than six feet long, with a total of three thousand to four thousand two hundred segments. Unarmed tapeworms are more than one to two feet long, with a total of one thousand three hundred segments or so. As for hydatid cysts, their cysts vary in size, from as small as millet grains to as large as human heads. Because of this, abdominal swelling is often mistaken for pregnancy if the patient is a woman. Liver flukes mostly parasitize in the liver, and the number of worms can be as many as several thousand to ten thousand. It is often the case that hundreds of roundworms parasitize in the body. Sometimes, there is a strange itching outside the anus during sleep, which is the roaming of pinworms, which is naturally more common in children, but it is not absolutely absent in adults.

There is an ancient saying in China that worm diseases often cause strange symptoms. This is truly based on experience. For example, some people suddenly like to eat wall soil, ash charcoal, paper scraps, cloth pieces, fingernails, etc., or like to eat spicy, vinegary, salty, raw rice, etc., which are not their usual preferences. All of these are caused by worms. Or the fingernails are deformed, pale, thin and brittle, with the front edge slightly turned upward, and the entire surface is wavy and concave, which is also a strange symptom.

It is impossible to eliminate parasites from heaven and earth, but human intelligence has already found ways to deal with them. No matter how treacherous and fierce they are, we can already understand their changes and methods of treatment.

Most human parasites parasitize in the human digestive system, with the stomach and intestines being the main ones. Therefore, most of the causes of gastrointestinal diseases are related to parasites. (Donation to help students)

### An Iron Factory in Bud

— Liu Yueshen

(1) What is an Iron Factory?

Can China now be self-sufficient? If you are interested, please pay attention to your daily life. How many of the clothes you wear, the food you eat, the houses you live in, and the things you use are purely domestic products? I don't need to go into details. This is a sad thing, and it is a dangerous disease. Yes, China can be said to be a country with vast land and abundant resources. Moreover, Mozi in the difficult times was able to build wooden kites, and Marquis Wu of Han was able to use clay oxen and wooden horses. Such old things can be boasted to the world, but what is the reality in front of us? I don't want to deliberately despise my motherland, but the result of avoiding illness and refusing treatment will make the disease incurable.

Promoting domestic goods is not a slogan of orators, nor is it a common idiom used by writers, but a difficult and important task. The only remedy is to develop industry, replace manual labor with machines, and engage in spinning, weaving, printing, dyeing, pharmaceutical manufacturing, flour milling... striving for speed and precision. However, where do these machines come from? On the one hand, we have to order them from foreign countries, but at the same time, we should also engage in manufacturing and catch up quickly, so as not to fall behind others forever.

In Shanghai, various industries are relatively developed, and the machine manufacturing industry has also improved somewhat. There are nearly a hundred large and small machine manufacturing plants, but it is very rare to have a plant with a little scale. It is even more rare to talk about the word "rationalization"!

The name "machine manufacturing plant" is too unfamiliar. It is better to call it an "iron factory" as the people of Shanghai do. However, readers must not misunderstand that an iron factory is a place for smelting iron or buying and selling iron plates and iron bars.

Here, I would like to describe a little about the content of an iron factory. Please forgive me for not having a beautiful writing style, and perhaps readers will find it boring.

A relatively complete iron factory should at least have the following departments:

Drawing Room——Commonly known as the sample room. When manufacturing a machine, the engineer must first draw a sketch based on scientific principles and practical experience, and then the draftsman draws it to completion with a pencil according to a certain proportion. Then, multiple copies are made and sent to various workshops for manufacturing.

Woodworking Shop——There are rough carpenters and fine carpenters. The former does work such as packing boxes, and the latter makes wooden models according to drawings for sand casting. The material of the wooden model is mostly Liu'an wood, which is mainly not easily deformed.

Casting Shop——Also known as the sand casting shop. The wooden model is surrounded by molding sand with fire-resistant and uniform characteristics, and then the wooden model is removed, and then molten pig iron or raw copper is poured in. After cooling, it becomes a part similar to the wooden model.

Forging Shop——Pig iron and raw copper are brittle and easy to break. Some parts in the machine need materials with ductility—such as wrought iron—for them. However, these materials often lack fluidity and cannot be cast. They must be heated red in the furnace, placed on an iron anvil, and hammered into the required shape with an iron hammer.

Machining Shop——No matter whether the workpiece is cast or forged, the surface is not smooth and the dimensions are not accurate. Sometimes it must be processed. The machining shop is the place where the so-called machine tools are powered to work. Although there are many machines available, the main ones are the lathe that turns the workpiece round, the shaper that planes it flat, the planer, and the drill press that drills holes.

Fitter Shop——Many parts that cannot be processed with power must be flattened and polished with a hammer, chisel, file, and other tools by clamping the workpiece on a vise. At the same time, the work of assembling various parts into a machine is also done here.

In fact, the iron factory mainly consists of the machining and fitting shops. Casting and raw materials are often outsourced, so there are specialized companies that deal in this, and the sand casting factory stands alone.

### Broken Sounds

— Idle's Remainder

The cat-eyed poet Edgar Allan Poe had many eccentricities in his life. He liked to wear winter clothes in summer and summer clothes in winter, and what he liked most was to drop valuable glassware from tall buildings and mansions. He loved to listen to the sound of this shattering and felt a burst of pleasure afterwards.

Loving to listen to and even pursue this sound of shattering, and feeling pleasure from it, is not only true of Edgar Allan Poe, but most ordinary people also harbor this strange consciousness, but it is expressed in actions to varying degrees. Whenever a person is in great anger or under the heavy pressure of depression, they often want to smash a glass, and at the same time, they suddenly seem to become a giant, wanting to smash the ceiling and destroy the window frames. Although it is useless, it seems to release a lot of "anger." No wonder there are specially made paper flower vases in the United States for angry people to throw, and the audience often feels pleasure when they see a scene in a bad movie where a character throws and destroys furniture.

The Soviet writer Gorky stated that his motivation for writing was to vent his boredom and pain. His works are often full of curses for the gray, soulless world. He cursed its destruction, and he also pursued a huge sound of shattering to attack all the stagnant lead-colored things. So, he wrote The Stormy Petrel, hoping for the arrival of a storm. Edgar Allan Poe's smashing of glass and Gorky's writing are worlds apart, but they both come from the same consciousness: the pursuit of the sound of shattering!

"May the storm come more violently!" I think everyone who is stifled by the gray life and feels suffocated has the same feeling as the stormy petrel.

### Sharing the Boat in Stormy Weather

— He Jia Zhi

(7) Sudden Thunder

Madam Ye the Second sighed and said, "Before your mother passed away, she wanted to explain this matter to you several times, and discussed it with me. I said, 'The child is still young, why frighten him?' I also said, 'The net of heaven is vast, and its mesh is wide but nothing escapes. If he is an evil person, heaven will not tolerate him.' Your mother listened to me and always swallowed her tears inwardly. Just thinking about this old matter would make her unhappy for at least three to five days." Wei Cheng originally wanted to conceal the matter of the will from his aunt, but now that he knew his aunt was much clearer than he was, he suddenly stood up, his eyes fixed on Madam Ye the Second. Madam Ye the Second said, "Sit down, why are you standing?" Wei Cheng said in a trembling voice, "Aunt, after reading the will, it was like a thunderbolt in clear skies. I wish I could immediately grab Cheng Bing, let me personally stab his chest, devour his flesh, and sleep on his skin. But, where is Cheng Bing? Aunt, when my father passed away, I was ignorant. My mother passed away less than a year later. At that time, it was the most difficult period of my twenty years of life. This time is even more difficult than the most difficult period. Aunt." Wei Cheng was not speaking the last two sentences, but sobbing. He put his arms across the table, lay his face on his arms, and his body was about to collapse. Cui Zhen rushed over, helped him up, and helped him sit in the chair. Madam Ye the Second took out a handkerchief from under her armpit and wiped away his tears, saying, "Good child, I don't know where Cheng Bing is. I know some things from before. Don't cry, I can tell you."

Although Wei Cheng was a very emotional young man, his reason could also overcome his emotions. Hearing that Madam Ye the Second could tell him some old stories, he raised his head and stared at Madam Ye the Second again. Madam Ye the Second said, "Drink a sip of hot tea, smoke a cigarette, and don't be unhappy at all. You need to know that this cannot be resolved by crying and being sad for a while. For example, to say something empty, even if Cheng Bing is standing in front of you, you cannot take a knife and kill him. Didn't your mother write in the will? Before you get married and have a son, your mother does not allow you to take revenge." Wei Cheng said, "Aunt, I understand this." He drank tea and smoked, earnestly listening. (138)

### People Suffer Without Knowing It

— Jing Wen

"Poof!" A sudden blow struck my face, and I felt my vision black out, almost knocking off my glasses.

"Sorry!" – It turned out that a friend had accidentally hit me with his elbow.

This was naturally nothing.

But the scenery in front of me suddenly became strange, and all the shapes seemed somewhat distorted, which I was not used to.

My eyes felt uncomfortable.

So I took off my glasses and wiped them. At that moment, I discovered that one leg of the glasses had been knocked askew. Putting them on and looking in the mirror, sure enough, the left lens was higher than my eyebrow, and my right eyeball was almost exposed above the lens.

Inspecting them, they were not about to break. I carefully bent it, trying to correct it.

Half an hour later, both legs had been adjusted to the same angle, the same curvature, and the same length. Placed on the table, they were stable, balanced, and symmetrical.

However, when I put them on my face, they were still uneven and still uncomfortable.

Why? Why were the symmetrical ones asymmetrical instead?

I couldn't figure it out, I had no solution. So I went into the eyeglasses shop and asked the clerk.

The clerk picked up the glasses, tilted his head, and examined them; then looked at my face, tilted his head, and examined it again. Quickly bending the right leg down a little, he told me to try them on, then bent it down a little more, and tried them on again.

A minute later, the glasses regained their balance, and my eyes regained their comfort. I took them off and looked at them with satisfaction: Ah, the angles of the two legs were different, the curvatures were different, and the lengths were also different!

Why? Why did the asymmetrical ones become symmetrical instead?

The clerk said, "Your ears are set high and low, sir!"

Ears can be set high and low? Is this possible? – Especially mine? I had never thought of it, I could never believe it!

However, the glasses on my nose forced me to admit it was true!

People suffer without knowing it!

What's the use of not knowing the shape of one's ears and vainly striving for the symmetry and perfection of the glasses legs themselves?

To wear glasses comfortably, after all, one must base it on the overall shape of the face.

### Quarrying

— Jia Ji

When I encounter difficulties and cannot solve them, I often go to see the stonemason quarrying. He always strikes, strikes, strikes, striking there all day long. Sometimes he strikes a hundred times, and the stone doesn't even have a crack. But when he strikes the hundred and first time, the stone suddenly splits open. I know that what makes the stone split is not just the last strike, but what is formed by each strike in front. (Original meaning of Rees)
