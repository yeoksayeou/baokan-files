### Kurdish People Riot, Britain and Soviet Union Divide Spheres of Influence in Iran

Vichy, 6th (Havas) The recent riots of the Kurdish people in the Soviet-controlled area of Iran have been commented on by political figures here, who believe that they were instigated by the Soviet Union. The gist of their comments is that although the awareness of the Kurdish people in Iran is limited to the Soviet-controlled area, its impact will still extend beyond that area.

The Kurdish people are only scattered in Iran, the Soviet Union, and Iraq, and there are also a significant number in Turkey. Therefore, if Turkey assists Germany in fighting against the Soviet Union in the future, it will be of great benefit to the Soviet Union. In short, the Soviet Union is working hard to organize the Kurdish people in Iran. If the focus of the war shifts in the coming weeks, the Kurdish people may play a pivotal role. The Soviet Union and Britain have already begun to divide their spheres of influence in Iran, with Britain controlling the entire southern part of Iran, and the Soviet Union controlling the area from the Caspian Sea to the Turkish and Iraqi borders, as well as the area along the northern border of Iran, so that the Soviet Union can station troops on the Afghan border all the way to western India. This part of Asia was originally Britain's forbidden zone. Now that Soviet influence has gradually invaded, its relationship is naturally very important. It is not difficult for the world to see from this what the future of the cooperative relationship between Britain and the Soviet Union in the Middle East will be.

### Fierce Fighting on the Eastern Front Continues; If the Soviet Union Cannot Resist the German Offensive, the Allies Will Open Up a New Battlefield

London, 7th (Reuter) Although Germany and the Soviet Union are both busy preparing for the spring offensive, the war on the Eastern Front has not diminished in intensity. News from the front lines reports that Soviet forces are exerting pressure in the Leningrad area.

Hitler's Headquarters, 7th (Haitong News Agency) This afternoon's German military report stated that the German army in Eastern Europe was victorious in its offensive, and all Soviet attacks were repelled. Important military targets in Leningrad were fiercely bombarded. 29 Soviet tanks were destroyed yesterday. A total of 60 Soviet aircraft were shot down and destroyed on the ground.

Moscow, 7th (Reuter) Today's Soviet supplementary statement stated that Soviet forces on the Kalinin Front had recovered 11 inhabited areas. In addition, the midday communique from the Soviet Information Bureau only stated, "On the night of April 6th, there were no major changes on the front."

Washington, 7th (Havas) According to officials here, the war situation in the Soviet Union is of vital importance to the Allied forces, so they must hold their ground at all costs. If the Soviet Union cannot resist the German spring offensive, the Allied forces will open up a new battlefield to reduce the pressure on the Soviet Union, even at great risk. Norway, the Netherlands, France, and the Near East are all possible battlefields.

### Winter Battles Have Ended

Berlin, 7th (Haitong News Agency) According to those in charge here last night, the winter battles on the Eastern Front can now be considered over. From the White Sea to the Black Sea, the war has entered a transitional period, because the melting of ice and snow makes roads impassable, and large-scale battles will not occur for the time being. Both sides are now preparing for the great battle to come. The Soviet army has shown signs of exhaustion. As for the German army, which resisted enemy attacks in winter, it is far inferior to the reserve German army, but the morale of the German army has not declined slightly. As for the enemy army, due to the continuous offensive in winter, the losses are greater than those of the defending army. The German defense strategy can be called successful. The troops used were small, so the losses were also small. In the first three months of this year, 100,000 Soviet troops were captured, and the number of dead and wounded was about ten times this number, but this is not a confirmed number, because there are still those buried in the snow. The German army has now formed special teams to clear the corpses on the battlefield. Most of the Soviet troops are sixteen or seventeen years old and sixty or seventy years old. The new German defense method is a continuous set of defense points, which makes the supply problem easy to solve. The Soviet army's supply problem cannot be solved. The Soviet army's breakthrough operations are often cut off from the rear, and the supply is insufficient. According to the staff of the Soviet General Staff, the Soviet Union has felt exhausted in the winter war, because it has not carried out a large-scale offensive.

### Germany Will Adopt Offensive After Spring Arrives

Kupyansk, 6th (United Press) The German army is now trying its best to recapture the Donets Basin and the main positions on the central route. According to official news, Timoshenko has now eliminated the German 6th and 17th Army spring reserve troops in the Donets Basin.

### Cripps Meets Nehru, Personally Delivers British Government's Reply, Scheduled to Announce the Outcome of Negotiations Today, British Cabinet Considers India's Defense Demands, Johnson Meets Auchterlony Nehru Yesterday

New Delhi, 7th (Havas) Nehru and National Congress President Auchterlony visited British Envoy Sir Cripps at 11:00 AM this morning, and Cripps personally delivered the British Government's reply. Eight minutes later, Nehru and Auchterlony exited.

New Delhi, 7th (Havas) The British wartime cabinet has drafted a reply to the memorandum submitted by the Indian National Congress, which will be forwarded by visiting envoy Sir Cripps to Congress President Auchterlony and Nehru. In addition, Jinnah, Chairman of the Indian Islamic League, is also scheduled to meet with Cripps again today.

Lisbon, 7th (Allied News Agency) According to Australian broadcasts received here, the British War Cabinet met last night to consider the Indian Congress Party's request that Indians bear greater responsibility for India's defense. The British Cabinet's reply has been sent to the Congress Party and Cripps. Earlier, news from New Delhi reported that Nehru had met with Colonel Johnson, President Roosevelt's personal representative visiting England, for three hours. After the meeting, Nehru assured Johnson that Indians would not misuse their power or interfere with British strategy, but Nehru said firmly that Indians were willing to die to defend their country, but not to fight for British commercial interests. At the same time, it is heard that the British government will announce the results of Cripps' negotiations with Indian leaders tomorrow.

New Delhi, 7th (Reuter) After Auchterlony and Nehru met with Cripps this morning, they had a brief meeting with Colonel Johnson. It is generally believed that the opportunity to resolve the Indian situation has improved, but a definite opinion on the reaction of the Standing Committee cannot be obtained until after the meeting this afternoon. The general feeling is that the British side has made some adjustments to the original declaration, especially regarding defense, in order to meet India's demands. It is heard that Colonel Johnson is in contact with the White House regarding the developments here.

New Delhi, 6th (Havas) After President Roosevelt's personal representative Johnson met with Indian Congress Party leaders Auchterlony and Nehru, he visited Sir Cripps today to discuss matters for a long time.

### Auchterlony and Nehru Report on Meeting with Cripps, Jinnah Separately Visits US Representative and Wavell

New Delhi, 7th (Reuter) The Standing Committee of the National Congress Party met this afternoon to listen to Auchterlony (Chairman) and Nehru report on their meeting with British Envoy Lord Privy Seal Cripps. In addition, Jinnah, Chairman of the All-India Islamic Association, met with Commander-in-Chief and Defense Member of the Indian Governor's Administrative Council Wavell tonight.

New York, 7th (Reuter) US criticism of India is becoming increasingly anxious. Several news announcers broadcast yesterday, suggesting that General Wavell be appointed as Governor of India and Nehru as Minister of Defense. The meeting between Colonel Johnson and Nehru also attracted considerable attention.

Lisbon, 6th (Allied News Agency) According to reports from New Delhi, US Presidential Envoy Johnson has begun to contact leaders of various factions in India. He met with National Congress Party Speaker Auchterlony on the night of the 5th and met with National Congress Party Speaker Nehru again today for two and a half hours. Whether Johnson's actions are a prerequisite for the US President to mediate the British-Indian negotiations is still uncertain, but it is undoubtedly certain that he will continue to meet with various factions in India, including Islamic League Chairman Jinnah. It is said that the purpose of the US delegation's visit to India is currently misunderstood by Indian industrialists, so Johnson clarified the purpose of the delegation to Nehru.

London, 6th (Havas) The Independent Labour Party passed a resolution today recognizing India's right to independence, requesting the British government to immediately grant India the responsibility for national defense and administration, and demanding that the government recognize the rights of ethnic minorities in India.

### Several Indian Political Groups Oppose British Proposals, All-India Nationalist League Submits Formal Note to Britain

New Delhi, 6th (Havas) Several Indian political groups publicly expressed their opposition to the plan proposed by British visiting envoy Sir Cripps today, and the political crisis facing British-Indian relations is becoming increasingly acute. For example, Islamist leader Maher Terk stated that the proposals put forward by the British government completely contradict the interests of Indian Muslims and cannot be accepted, as the legitimate rights of Muslims will be completely deprived after acceptance.

The All-India Islamic League also passed a resolution authorizing Chairman Jinnah to "take any measures at any time to protect the lives, property, and honor of Indian Muslims."

The position of the Indian National Congress has not been fully explained. According to a statement issued to the press by the Chairman of the Congress, Auchterlony, the Congress has not yet received Sir Cripps' supplementary explanation. After receiving it, the Executive Committee of the Congress will convene a meeting to discuss it.

The Executive Committee of the All-India Nationalist League also issued a formal statement expressing its opposition to the British proposals, stating that accepting Sir Cripps' proposals is not accepting the claim that India should be divided between Hindus and Muslims, but separating the Hindu and Muslim provinces from each other, so the League finds it difficult to agree to this proposal.

New Delhi, 6th (Havas) The All-India Nationalist League recently sent a note to British visiting envoy Sir Cripps, expressing its opposition to the British proposals. The note stated briefly that Britain's provision of a definite and unwavering promise for the future status of India is deeply appreciated, but it is very disappointing to say that the future India will become a "New Indian Federation". India is a self-contained unit in terms of culture and territory, with a common history and background, and must maintain a unified political organization. Any proposal that is not based on the concept of a unified Indian nation-state cannot be accepted by us. As for the British proposal to allow the various provinces of India to freely decide whether to join the new federation or not, we also oppose it. In fact, destroying the unity of India is the fundamental element of the British proposal. For example, India is not given free state treatment, but the provinces in a secondary administrative position are allowed complete freedom. If so, a large part of our country will no longer join the federation in order to gain freedom. This situation can only be called "distorted autonomy". Given this situation, the All-India Nationalist Party cannot but doubt the sincerity of the British wartime cabinet in proposing this proposal. In a nutshell, Britain put forward this plan with ulterior motives, attempting to sacrifice the unity of India and seek a temporary solution to the religious problems of India.

New Delhi, 7th (Havas) Munuai, Vice-President of the Indian Mahayana Association, sent a telegram to US President Roosevelt today, explaining the reasons for opposing the British proposals. The most important reason is that they are harmful to Indian unity. It is said that the comments made by the British and American sides on this proposal lack a practical understanding of the Indian political situation. The British proposals on independence and dominion status can be approved, but the provisions on dividing India to suit religious and ethnic conditions are sufficient to produce several "Northern Irelands". The harm caused will make the disputes endless, and even cause civil war, destroying the integrity of the anti-constitutional political system, and making India "Balkanized". If the clauses that are not convenient to agree to in the British proposals are not deleted, it will be enough to prevent India from achieving unity. This unity is the common goal of the Indian nationalist faction and the British leaders in India. It is a misunderstanding to say that India has never been unified in history and culture. In fact, since ancient times, India has been a single nation. If India has internal worries, it will not be able to take care of the important task of participating in the war.

Finally, Munuai said that the association is the only organization that promotes the militarization and industrialization of India to enrich the national government.

### Halifax Speaks in the United States, Expresses Opinions on Indian Affairs

New York, 7th (Reuter) British Ambassador Halifax, who served as Governor of India for five years, delivered a speech at a meeting in New York last night, first outlining the geographical, ethnic, and political background of India, and then stating that the constitutional development of India reached the point where the Indian Government Act was finally passed in 1935, giving India the constitutional status it has now acquired. If no agreement is reached on other plans, this status will continue to exist. The British request to obtain the voice of the largest and best organized political party in India, the Indian National Congress, has been rejected by other Indian groups. The members of these groups account for almost half of the entire population, including 90 million Muslims and a large number of Hindus. As for the Indian princes and their states, they are not suitable for the India expected by the Congress Party. However, the independence of the princes is subject to the signing of strict treaties with the King of England. These treaties can only be changed through negotiation. The Congress Party, the Islamic Association, the oppressed classes, and the princes are the four major factors. To achieve full unity in India in order to exercise the functions of a complete country, these four major factors must be merged. Halifax concluded that if the spokespersons for India refuse the British proposals, the British government will have to carry out its own tasks without the assistance and cooperation of the major Indian parties.

### India Appoints Representative to Chongqing

New Delhi, 7th (Reuter) According to an official announcement, the Indian government has appointed Sir Grinchaiferula as India's first representative to Chongqing, and will depart for Chongqing to take office within days. Sir was originally a member of the Indian Governor-General's Executive Council and is currently a judge of the Federal Court.

### Nehru Issues Declaration Stating India Must Be Unified

New Delhi, 7th (Reuter) Nehru issued a statement here last night, solemnly stating that India must be unified. A unified India must include not only British India, but also the various states of India, and said that we are prepared to fight for this unified India and will never allow India to split. Any treaty that goes against human welfare and human rights must be abolished. This war must change the world, and the various states of India must also change accordingly. Nehru's remarks fully reflect the content of the resolution of the Standing Committee of the Indian National Party. This resolution has not yet been announced, nor has it been submitted to Cripps, and the Indian Islamic Association advocates that the provinces inhabited by Hindus and Muslims should be divided. Nehru's remarks are also a warning against this movement. In addition, since President Roosevelt's personal representative, Colonel Johnson, met with Nehru and Indian National Party Chairman Auchterlony and Cripps, a new force has emerged in the negotiation process. Cripps was originally scheduled to meet with foreign journalists today, but it has been decided to postpone it to tomorrow, when the results of the two-week negotiations may be announced. However, Jinnah, Chairman of the Indian Islamic Association, said yesterday afternoon at the closing of the association's congress in Allahabad that we demand division and we demand self-government. What is the use of establishing such a government if it cannot guarantee human equality? What is the use of establishing this government if it cannot enable the poor and the helpless to earn a living? Our history of struggle is nothing more than an attempt to help these poor and helpless people. Jinnah has returned here last night.

In our history, we have made great sacrifices to achieve unification. Today, we should have a desire to preserve the territories that have already been recovered.

### Special Article: Turkey's Moat

As the saying goes, if the Germans spent a great deal of effort, sweeping east and west, and incorporating the entire Europe, along with a part of Asia, into their bag, they are naturally preparing to stand alone and cut themselves off from everything. At this time, if an opponent comes out of the shadows and insists on sharing a piece of the pie while they are exhausted, just like partitioning Poland, wouldn't that be too unhappy? Fighting is impossible, and not fighting means handing over the world that they have so painstakingly acquired. Of course, they are unwilling. So, rather than regretting it at this stage, it is better to weigh things up before the fat sheep is in hand.

Furthermore, to take a step back and think, even if the Soviet Union sits by and watches, and only guards its own territory without interfering in world affairs, the Germans still have a reason for not wanting it. Why? We must not forget a few ancient sayings: "There are not two suns in the sky, there are not two kings on the land, there are not two masters in the family, and there are not two superiors." How can the world be big enough to accommodate two overlords? This is also a reason why we must weigh things up.

To take another step back, as the saying goes, "You must not have the heart to kill, but you must have the heart to guard against others." Before Zhuge Liang marched north, he had to go deep into the barren land to pacify Meng Huo. What was the purpose? Wasn't it to defend against people one step ahead?

With these reasons, such as the oil and wheat in Ukraine and the Caucasus, etc., are also necessities for marching troops, so the Germans are not polite and will have to attack the Soviet Union again. Moreover, they have already turned their faces, so they can't

The Art World: Impressions After Seeing "The Hunchback of Notre Dame" by Jiang Bai

From the very start, the audience receives a fresh impression: the set design is elegant, simple, logical, and artistic. The lighting further emphasizes a sense of the lower depths—darkness—accentuated by the music. It intensifies the drama of the play’s opening, especially the hunchback's movements, which are almost entirely driven by the music. This is a highly satisfying start to the play.

The makeup of the street performers is very realistic. The elder stands and uses the traditional tones of a street vendor to draw people in. Each performer is placed appropriately. It’s a shame that the few clowns' skills are somewhat lacking. If the mute character were replaced by a truly skilled performer, demonstrating his craft onstage, it would seem even more authentic. The archdeacon is very important in this play and also one of the most difficult roles to play. His appearance must exude an air of respect, even though he is an antagonist. It is important to show that he is not a villain who fears no one.

Here, Tu Guangqi plays the archdeacon, but he lacks a fundamental understanding of the character. He doesn't yet grasp the identity of an archdeacon, and the director must share some of the blame for this. However, this is somewhat forgivable since they may not be very familiar with Catholicism, so small details are sometimes overlooked. When the archdeacon gives his blessing, it shouldn't just be a casual wave of his right hand in the air. He should make the sign of the cross on the head of the person being blessed, from top to bottom, left to right. Although the period is long ago, this ritual hasn't changed much.

While the makeup of the Hunchback of Notre Dame doesn't quite capture the expression of Charles Laughton in the film, achieving such results in the evolution of Chinese drama is still commendable. Jiang Shan is very successful in the role of the hunchback, and his movements are natural, indicating that he has thoroughly studied the character. Indeed, his role is the most demanding. Every moment of his appearance involves leaping, and his crudeness, awkwardness, and sincerity are constantly on display. Jiang Shan is able to fully achieve this, which shows his hard work. However, the greatest credit should be given to the director, who used various techniques to express the hunchback's personality and employed music to help the hunchback express his emotions. Music accompanies every one of the hunchback’s movements.

The second act is even more dynamic. The set design remains as evocative. At this point, the archdeacon suddenly changes his demeanor, abruptly shedding his mask of charity and benevolence, revealing a ferocious and terrifying face, and whipping the hunchback. Although the hunchback is wild and uncouth, his heart is most compassionate. He refuses to ring the bell that will kill people, but he is ultimately compelled to do so by the archdeacon's whip. This segment is the most intense of the entire play. When the hunchback is forced to pull the rope, hanging and swaying as he rings the bell, it truly makes the audience resent and curse the archdeacon and sympathize with the hunchback.

The set changes are very quick. In front of the serene church, the archdeacon's secret is discovered. The author is gradually exposing the hypocrisy of those who deceive people in the name of God, presenting them before us.

The hunchback is eventually captured, whipped, and left thirsty. Jiang Shan's expressions at this point are not quite adequate. He should appear more pitiful, as if unable to speak. Those who have seen Charles Laughton should remember this.

Xu Li, as the officer, captures some of the essence of the role, but it is a bit too contrived. The scene of the officer's secret rendezvous with the dancer is well-integrated. The director displays his brilliant technique here, using a comedic approach, which is appropriate.

When the hunchback saves the dancer, he should be more frantic. When the hunchback realizes that his best friend is about to be executed, he is very anxious and desperate to save her. Here, the actions should be quick, leaping to the execution platform in one bound. If he were to stumble, it would appear even more realistic. Jiang Shan did not achieve this, and this omission significantly impacts the climax of the play. However, it still produces some effect. This cannot be attributed to the director or the actors alone; it is the power of the play itself.

The ending is very effective, capturing the audience's emotions. Overall, this play is a success. It can be described as an artistic performance and is worthy of our praise. We hope that the art theater group will continue to maintain its existing record and create new ones.

### Small Biographies of Figures in the Pear Garden: Written by Zheng Guoyi, Illustrated by Zhang Yizhang, Section on Female Performers

(13) Zhang Wenjuan

Zhang Wenjuan started in small theaters in Shanghai. After becoming famous there, she went to Beijing and immediately led her own troupe. Returning to Shanghai, she easily recruited famous performers of the Beijing style. Her rise to fame and the good fortune she encountered are unparalleled among female performers. However, her father's ability to see her potential early on and his refusal to let her develop carelessly also involved a great deal of effort and cultivation. Furthermore, he knew how to choose teachers wisely. Chen Xiuhua and Zhang Rongkui were both excellent teachers. Zhang Rongkui was undoubtedly the best contemporary teacher of male roles requiring elaborate military costumes and accoutrements. Chen Xiuhua also had Yang Baosen and Li Shaochun among his disciples, who brought honor to the school, demonstrating his depth. Wenjuan also studied with Yang Baozhong, who had indeed been taught by Yu Shuyan. Therefore, although Zhang Wenjuan is still young and has not yet achieved profound mastery, her initial steps are on the right path, avoiding deviations. If she can remain grounded, proceed step by step, and not be tempted by fleeting opportunities, her potential for development is greater than that of other female performers.

Zhang Junqiu's Troupe Comes to Fruition by Zhongtang

The young and famous Dan performer, Zhang Junqiu, since parting ways with Gou Liang and leaving the Fu Lian Troupe, has been actively preparing to form her own troupe, taking on the leading role herself, with Zhao Yanqiu and the veteran actor Yu Yongli assisting in everything. We have learned that the troupe formation is now complete, named the "Qian He Troupe," and it officially premiered on the 28th of last month at the Kaiming Theatre in Beijing.

The internal cast includes Sun Yukun as the second-ranking Wusheng performer and Ji Yuliang as the veteran actor. Other supporting roles are filled by Li Jinhong, Hou Xirui, Shi Huibao, Li Duokui, Jiang Miaoxiang, Xiao Changhua, Sun Chunyan, Wang Quankui, and others. Junqiu performed "Visiting Mother on Her Return Order," Hou Xirui performed "Battling Wan City," Shi Huibao performed "Stories Spread Among Opera Fans," and Li Duokui performed "Fishing for a Son-in-law," all with tickets priced at just two yuan, truly offering high quality at a low price. Junqiu's second performance was "Han Mingfei," which is Shang Xiaoyun's exclusive script. The lyrics are by no means simple, and it goes without saying that this was also Zhao Yanqiu's persuasion, making Zhang the "successor" to Shang's legacy.

However, according to those in and outside the industry, Zhang's troupe may not last long. Sun Yukun, the second-ranking Wusheng performer, is not one to be subordinate to others. He has always formed his own troupe for performances, and his reputation is not comparable to that of ordinary supporting Wusheng performers. Veteran actor Ji Yuliang is difficult to compare with Chen Shaolin and Guan Shaohua. Others, such as Xiao Changhua, Jiang Miaoxiang, Hou Xirui, and Wang Quankui, are all part of several troupes in Tianjin, so if they travel with Zhang to perform elsewhere, it may cause problems for the other troupes. However, we believe that with Junqiu's intelligence and capability, she will be able to solve these minor problems. It is rumored that the expenses are considerable, and with such low ticket prices, Zhang's own salary may be an issue.

Casual Talk About Pang Xueqing by Chi Lan

Recently, every storytelling venue in Shanghai has been packed. The famous performers of Suzhou storytelling in Guangyu Society have all garnered high praise from customers. Among them, Wei Yuqing is famous for his masterful singing of the Ma tune in "Pearl Tower," and there are many who inherit his style. These include his son Wei Hanying, his disciples Shen Jian'an, Xue Xiaoqing, and Zhong Xiaonong, all of whom are renowned.

Hou Jiuxia and Shen Huiren have also become prominent among duos. Others, such as Shen and Xue's disciples and Jian'an's various students, all have "An" in their names, such as Tang Naian, Li Nianan, and Lü Yian. Xiaoqing's students all have "Qing" in their names, such as Chen Wenqing, Pang Xueqing, Zhu Zaiqing, and Zhao Huiqing. These young performers have all just started out and cannot yet be considered masters. However, Pang Xueqing's skill has a unique quality that deserves to be commented on.

Xueqing debuted relatively early and has already performed in various cities in Jiangsu and Zhejiang. His storytelling, jokes, and singing have a quality of surpassing his teacher. Now, his opportunity has arrived. When Shen and Xue, his longtime partner, split up, Xiaoqing needed a replacement. Xueqing was summoned by his teacher to be his replacement, and from then on, he ascended to prominence, increasing his value tenfold. In addition to Cangzhou and Huiquanlou, he also performs at Huyuan. This venue is close to Yu Qingzhai. Since the storytelling began, there has been a full house every night. His singing is melodious and captivating, making it truly commendable. In "Pearl Tower," from Chen Cuie's carrying the thorns to apologize onwards, Xueqing's portrayal of Caiping, the maidservant accompanying Chen Cuie, and in the scene where Fang Qing meets with her in the Green Autumn Pavilion, in the line where Caiping sings "There are still unfulfilled things in my life, but I don't know when I will return to my hometown with the coffin," the facial expressions and the tone of singing "unfulfilled things" are unmatched by others who sing "Pearl Tower." In the final segment, in the line "Infinite shame and infinite embarrassment, white face blushing," the emphasis on the words "white face" is extremely subtle. In the last line, "A little bit of voice was not uttered," the three words "was not uttered" are delicate, soft, light, shy, and embarrassed, vividly depicting the scene, almost making the listeners exclaim in admiration. Xueqing's future is truly limitless.

Review of the Opera School's "Chessboard Mountain" by Xin Juan

Yesterday, I went to the Gengxin Theatre to see Guan Zhengming, a student from the Shanghai Opera School, perform the complete "Empty City Stratagem." The student's appearance was very handsome, his bearing elegant, and his voice was mellow and flavorful, making him a promising talent. Zhou Zhengli, who played Sima Yi, was both vocally and dramatically strong and is destined for great things in the future.

"Chessboard Mountain" is the Opera School's first public performance of a female warrior opera. Gu Zhengqiu and Zhang Zhengfang shared the role of Baoxiantong, and Xue Jinqin and Gu Zhengqiu had gentle and lovely appearances. Their acting was delicate, and their rapid arias were particularly pleasant and melodious. Zhang Zhengfang was also good, but her voice was slightly inferior.

Zhou Zhengli's Cheng Yaojin and Zhang Zhengfang's Yin Yihu were full of humor and wit, adding a lot of color to the entire play.

Xue Zhengkang's Xue Dingshan was very disciplined, but his appearance was not as handsome as Huang Zhengqin, who played Dou Yihu.

It is said that the school's next performance will be the newly staged complete "Xun Guan Niang."

Entertainments Miscellaneous: Cockfighting by Ze Fu

Cockfighting has been popular in our country since the Zhou Dynasty. The Zuo Zhuan states: "The cockfighting of Ji and Hou involved Ji decorating his cocks and Hou putting metal spurs on them." When cocks fight, they must also be armed in order to win. "Jie" refers to mustard seeds, sprinkled on the cocks' shoulders and armpits to blind the enemy cocks. "Xin" refers to thin blades, attached to the cocks' spurs to wound the enemy cocks' bodies. This practice continued for thousands of years, and five hundred children were selected from the Six Armies to be specially trained to feed the cocks. Jia Chang was summoned into the palace because he was skilled at handling cocks, given a military rank, and rewarded with gold and silk, enjoying immense favor for a time. (Details can be found in Chen Hong's "Eastern City Elder's Biography"). Since the Song Dynasty, people outside the Lingnan region have also been very fond of this pastime. To this day, this tradition is still prevalent in various parts of Henan. Every year in the first and second lunar months, societies are formed to compete in cockfighting, and the spectators are like walls. The method of competition is roughly divided into three stages: at the beginning of the fight, if one cock loses, its owner will hold it for a short rest, supposedly to drink water and nourish its energy; this is the first stage. If the other cock loses again, its owner will also hold it for a rest in the same way; this is the second stage. In the final stage, neither owner is allowed to intervene, and the victory or death of the two cocks is determined. At the beginning of the fight, the cocks use their spurs, but if they are tired, they will peck at each other until death. These cockfighting cocks must be specially cared for in advance, so they are different from ordinary domestic chickens.

Sharing the Same Boat Through Storms by He Jia Zhi

(3) Guests Arrive

In the evening, Wei Cheng wouldn't let Huang Long leave, saying, "We've been brothers since we were kids. I don't have any real brothers. Don't leave, brother." Huang Long sat on a swivel chair, put his feet up, and spun the chair back and forth, the iron axle underneath creaking. He laughed, "Who wants to leave? I'm just teasing. I wish Brother Wei Cheng would keep me here. I knew Brother Wei Cheng would keep me here." Wei Cheng said, "You can drink. You can drink slowly. I've been through a lot, so I've only had a sip of broth." At this time, the Ye family heard Wei Cheng thinking of inviting people to drink, and they also wanted to eat something. Everyone felt a sense of joy amidst their grief.

Aunt Xie and the other ladies were exhausted and couldn't take it anymore. Moreover, tomorrow was New Year's Eve, and they each had household chores to take care of, so they all said goodbye to Second Mrs. Ye. Seeing that Huang Long could relieve Wei Cheng's loneliness and sorrow, Second Mrs. Ye thought it was a good idea and quickly instructed the old maid and the servants to bring out dinner for Huang Long to eat, while she also engaged him in a few words on the side.

It turned out that Huang Long was from Huagang. One year, the Ye family hired a tutor, and Huang Long came to study with him. This was because Huang Long's father trusted the Shide Hall more than anything else, saying, "The Ye family is a family of scholars for generations. Studying in the Ye family will guarantee a successful future." So he went to the trouble of sending his son to the Ye family instead of having him study at the Huagang Public Primary School nearby. At that time, Wei Cheng and Huang Long were only eight or nine years old. Wei Cheng was particularly quiet, while Huang Long was particularly active. The tutor, with his eyes hidden behind dark glasses, was determined to educate the snot-nosed children so that they would become generals and ministers in the future. Whenever he saw Huang Long make a move, he would punish him with the summer cane. But Huang Long was mischievous. As soon as he saw that the tutor's expression was not right, he would put his palms together and rub them vigorously, creating a sulfuric smell in his palms. The tutor would shout, and he would close his eyes and hold out his hand to be beaten. He only closed his eyes and never frowned. His expression was no different from that of a hero on the execution ground saying, "Twenty years from now, I'll still be a good man." (44)

### Tense Battles on the Bataan Peninsula: Japanese Forces Launch All-Out Attack; U.S. Defenses in Grave Situation; Fierce Fighting Rages All Day on the Right Flank and in the Central Sector

Washington, 7th (Reuters) – The U.S. War Department announced this morning that Japanese forces, through repeated heavy attacks on the central sector of the U.S. defensive line on the Bataan Peninsula (Luzon Island), have continued to achieve "some success." Fierce fighting occurred on the Bataan front yesterday.

Washington, 7th (Reuters) – The War Department announced that fierce fighting raged all day Sunday on the right flank and in the central sector of the Bataan Peninsula in the Philippines. The situation of the U.S.-Philippine Allied forces on that front and at the Corregidor Island fortress in Manila Bay is grave.

Washington, 6th (United Press) – The Japanese advance on the Bataan Peninsula appears to be concentrated on the right side of the battle line. The Japanese strategy in this area seems to be to cut off the defenders' right flank in order to control the main north-south highway leading to the sea. This highway is General Wainwright's lifeline, with food and ammunition for the defenders being transported from Corregidor via this road. If the Japanese control this road, they will also cut off the defenders' retreat route to Corregidor. The Philippine campaign, about to enter its fifth month tomorrow, now appears to be approaching its most critical stage. Authoritative sources urge everyone not to be overly optimistic, as the bombardment endured by the defenders is terrifying and almost beyond human endurance. Japanese artillery fire has been almost continuous for half a month. Japanese commander General Yamashita seems determined to subdue the defenders with all available manpower and resources. The Japanese are now using an even greater number of reinforcements, dive bombers, and tanks.

New Zealand Strengthens Naval and Air Forces

Saigon, 7th (Transocean) – According to news from Sydney yesterday, Thursday Island and the other islands in the Torres Strait are under the jurisdiction of the Australian Department of Defence.

Port Moresby Attacked Again from the Air

Melbourne, 6th (Havas) – The Army Department has announced that Port Moresby, New Guinea, was subjected to twenty-three air raids today. Details are not yet clear.

Except for tires, tubes, and shoe soles, rubber may not be used to manufacture other goods, except for those already in production as of March 31 this year.

Saigon, 7th (Transocean) – According to Canberra, the Australian government's restrictions on the use of rubber will most affect the production of tires, rubber boats, rubber soles, and the use of rubber by gas plants, water plants, and power companies.

The Japanese military will use troop transport ships to transport raw materials and grain back to Japan, potentially returning 3,000,000 tons annually. The important oil fields of Palembang, Sumatra, were not destroyed by enemy forces due to the swift action of Japanese paratroopers. Due to the increased supply of gasoline, the gasoline quotas for steamers, fishing boats, and trucks will be increased by one-third this year.

Medan, 6th (Reuter) – Public order throughout Sumatra is now being maintained by the Japanese military and is becoming increasingly stable. Reconstruction work in major cities such as Medan, Palembang, and Padang is progressing rapidly. In northern Sumatra, more than ten cities in the Aceh, Langsa, Meulaboh, Takengon, Kuala Simpang, and other regions have recently established public order maintenance associations. The president of the public order maintenance association for the entire Aceh region is Alif, a respected elder of the Aceh people.

### Japanese Naval Circles Deny Warship Losses

Tokyo, 7th (Reuter) – Well-informed naval sources claim that U.S. reports that American submarines sank one Japanese light cruiser, probably sank another cruiser, and destroyed two seaplane tenders and three other Japanese ships in the South Pacific are pure fabrication, merely reflecting the U.S. Navy's predicament of being unable to mount an effective counter-offensive in the Pacific.
