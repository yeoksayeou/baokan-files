### German Forces Continue to Advance: The Caucasus Battle Situation is Severe; Soviet Troops on the Stalingrad Front are Striving to Mend Gaps in the Line

A certain border area of the Soviet Union, 4th, Havas News Agency: Today marks the 408th day of the German-Soviet war. The two main objectives of the German forces are: 1. To encircle the Red Army units in the Kuban pocket; 2. To control the Rostov-to-Baku railway line, controlling as much of its length as possible. German forces, having conquered Voroshilovgrad, have already occupied the area between the city and Salsk, and are advancing along the Yegorlyk River. Other motorized units are also advancing from Salsk towards Tikhoretsk, and along the railway line that was cut yesterday near Belaya Glina. Heavy fighting is also taking place between the Don and Sal Rivers, with German-Romanian forces advancing northeast, attempting to isolate the large Red Army forces concentrated between the Don and Volga Rivers. The Red Army in the Kalach district is still resisting fiercely, but the only option for that army's positions now is to move eastward. The Red Army plans to use the remaining forces in Stalingrad to attack the German flanks and advance towards the Sal River, but all attempts have been thwarted by the German forces. A major battle once broke out between the motorized units of the two armies. Under the assault of German dive bombers, the Red Army had no choice but to retreat in a panic. South of there, the battle situation is clearly unfavorable to the Red Army. German forces are now threatening the vital railway line from Tuapse to Armavir. The entire plain of the Kuban near Voronezh has no place for the Red Army to stand. The Red Army can only deploy new defenses in the deep mountains of the Caucasus and continue to resist.

Stockholm, Sweden, 5th, Havas News Agency: According to the latest news from the eastern front, the vanguard of the German forces on the southern front is now only fifteen miles from Armavir (a military town west of Voroshilovgrad). The city may fall within forty-eight hours. Indeed, the German occupation of Voroshilovgrad and the crossing of the Kuban River near Kropotkin have threatened the oil fields of Armavir and Maikop, as well as the industrial areas of Solimov, Batalpashinskaya, Essentuki, Piatigorsk, and Kislovodsk. These areas are also new starting points for advancing towards the Black Sea port of Tuapse and the Grozny region. As for other German units, they are advancing rapidly westward, heading straight for Krasnodar. The vanguard is reportedly only forty miles from the city. Once Armavir and Krasnodar fall, Maikop will face a pincer attack. It will be another matter if the German authorities decide to strike directly at the Black Sea coast and occupy the port of Novorossiysk. The Red Army has reportedly begun to destroy the Maikop refineries and oil wells, using a method of pouring cement into the well bottoms, making it a major undertaking to restore the wells for reuse. Furthermore, according to a German spokesman, the German forces advancing southwest of the Kuban have been temporarily slowed down due to the rugged terrain of northern Caucasus and the active resistance of the Red Army.

Moscow, 5th, Allied News Agency: Last night, German forces penetrated deep into the Caucasus region. On the Stalingrad front on the Don River bend, the Red Army is making every effort to mend the gaps in its lines and eliminate the Axis forces. In the Kletskaya area of the Don River, all German forces attempting to cross the river have been repelled by the Red Army. The Red Army is also making every effort to prevent the advance of German forces in Lomliansk.

Istanbul, 5th, Hai Tong News Agency: The Soviet Union's midnight communique admits that Soviet forces in the Caucasus continue to retreat, withdrawing from the Salsk district to Belaya Glina, about eighty kilometers west of Salsk.

Stockholm, Sweden, 4th, Havas News Agency: Soviet radio announced that fierce fighting took place last night in the Kletskaya, Koshevskaya, and Belaya Glina districts. Nothing else of note occurred on other parts of the front.

Soviet Forces Launch Fierce Counterattack in the Kropotkin District

A certain border area of Ukraine, 4th, Havas News Agency: According to an official announcement from Berlin, German forces on the southern front continue to make progress. The fall of the city of Voroshilovgrad is enough to show that the Caucasus battle situation is approaching a point where the forces under the command of General Voroshilov, the commander-in-chief of the Red Army on the southern front, will soon be cut in two. The German objective is clearly to seize the city of Piatigorsk, which is built on a mountain. German forces are now only twenty-five miles from there. Once that city falls, the Red Army fighting on both sides of the Rostov-Armavir communication line will be completely isolated. According to the latest news, the Red Army launched a fierce counterattack in the Kropotkin district this morning. German forces there reached the Kuban River forty-eight hours ago. Although the Red Army's resistance is strong, it cannot drive the German forces out of the bridgeheads on the west bank of the river. In the Tiflis district, German forces continued to advance westward after passing through Lavrskaya. East of Kropotkin, German forces have occupied Novotroitskoye and are now only twenty miles from the city of Armavir. In addition, the German forces under General Buck are launching an offensive in the northeast, with the obvious aim of completing the encirclement of Stalingrad. That force is advancing downstream along the Volga River.

German Supreme Headquarters, 5th, Hai Tong News Agency: Today's German war report stated that German-Romanian forces east of the Sea of Azov reached the area of the Yeysk railway. The enemy occasionally resisted. The Kropotkin railway junction near the Kuban River was occupied by German forces. North of Armavir, German forces completed the construction of bridgehead fortifications on the western bank of the Kuban River. Several enemy units had their communications cut off by our mechanized units. Our aircraft attacked the enemy forces retreating towards the Caucasus. German dive bombers destroyed two armored trains and twenty-four freight cars. Italian MAS torpedo boats operating in the Black Sea sank a cruiser. German aircraft cleared the way for armored vehicles between the Sal and Don Rivers in a show of force. The Soviet forces in the large bend of the Don River attempted a counterattack without success. Fierce fighting took place between Soviet and German forces in the Rzhev area. Our forces are well-coordinated. The enemy units that have been trapped have still been unable to break out of the encirclement. The enemy forces in the Volkhov and Leningrad areas have also been defeated.

Berlin, 5th, Hai Tong News Agency Urgent Telegram: The German High Command announced that German forces have advanced and occupied the city of Kropotkin in the Kuban region.

### German Minister of Armaments Inspects Western European Defenses; All Military Installations are Camouflaged; General Marshall to be Appointed Supreme Commander of Allied Forces

Berlin, 5th, Hai Tong News Agency: German Minister of Armaments Albert Speer, accompanied by General Dietrich, commander of the Fuehrer Escort Command, inspected several fortresses along the European coastline. Long-range heavy artillery is protected by thick, reinforced concrete walls, surrounded by smaller cannons. These heavy guns are very easy to operate. All military installations are camouflaged, making them impossible to spot from the air, sea, or land. If the enemy wants to attack, they must walk into the range of these cannons. The coastal waters are protected by countless mines. Behind the naval and land artillery positions are deep and wide land defenses and air cover.

Berlin, 4th, Havas News Agency: According to a statement by the German News Agency, the defense works along the European coast are impregnable. All long-range coastal artillery is surrounded by bunkers for protection, making them seem unshakeable. The same is true of nearby anti-aircraft guns and heavy artillery for attacking ships. Although the artillery is large, it is agile and maneuverable, and does not feel clumsy. There are smaller cannons in front and behind for cover, and they are well-hidden, making them extremely difficult to spot from the sky or from the sea. If the enemy lands anywhere, they can be detected in time and stopped. The first line is buried with landmines to stop their advance. In addition, naval artillery of various sizes can fire at any time and in any place. Even if some scattered units gain a foothold on the coast, there are other landmines, machine guns, barbed wire, hand grenades, flamethrowers, and infantry to stop their advance. Furthermore, large land and air forces can be dispatched from all directions at any time to intercept them.

London, 4th, Havas News Agency: It is understood that U.S. Army Chief of Staff General Marshall is very likely to be appointed Supreme Commander of the Allied forces in Western Europe. Recently, the British government studied the issue of unifying military command in Western Europe and agreed in principle to appoint one person as Supreme Commander to centralize authority. However, it is believed here that the final decision on the selection of the Supreme Commander will depend on the number of troops deployed by the participating countries.

Madrid, 5th, Hai Tong News Agency: Ya News Agency's special correspondent in New York reported that the problem that the Allied countries urgently need to solve is still the establishment of a common military and economic leader. Without a common leader, the production of war equipment has been delayed a lot. Although there have been repeated talks between London and Washington, no concrete measures have been established. The New York Times recently published an editorial strongly advocating the necessity of war material shortage and a common leadership system. In fact, this plan is not absolutely impossible to implement, but because the personal interests of American capitalists are still very strong, there will inevitably be many difficulties in the beginning of the implementation.

### Tragedy in Lisbon: A Certain Family Holds a Wedding Feast; Sixty Guests are Poisoned

Lisbon, 5th, Havas News Agency: Today, a certain family held a wedding feast, with many guests and a lively atmosphere. Unexpectedly, it was discovered afterwards that sixty guests had been poisoned, several of whom were in serious condition. It is said that the wedding cake contained toxic substances.

### German and British Air Forces Bomb Each Other; More Than 100 British Airfields are Assigned for Use by the U.S. Military

Berlin, 5th, Hai Tong News Agency: An authoritative source here announced this morning that German air fleets bombed port and industrial facilities on the west coast of Britain last night. A small number of British bombers invaded western Germany, dropping bombs and incendiary bombs, suffering slight losses. One British bomber was shot down.

London, 4th, Havas News Agency: It was recently learned that a German bomber flew over two cities on the southern coast of England this morning and dropped bombs. Local anti-aircraft batteries immediately fired at it. The plane flew towards the sea to drop its bombs, resulting in several houses being hit and several civilians injured. Another bomber flew over a city in the mid-east and dropped bombs, killing seven civilians. The plane was shot down by local anti-aircraft batteries.

Stockholm, Sweden, 5th, Hai Tong News Agency: According to a dispatch from London, one hundred and ninety airfields in the United Kingdom have been assigned for use by the U.S. Air Force stationed in England. The ground personnel at these airfields are also all U.S. military personnel.

### The Mystery of British Prime Minister Churchill's Visit to the Soviet Union?

Stockholm, Sweden, 5th, Hai Tong News Agency: A Swedish correspondent in England stated that the extremely short closed-door meeting held in the British House of Commons yesterday indirectly confirms the rumors that Churchill is currently visiting the Soviet Union. Although the content of Deputy Prime Minister Attlee's speech at this closed-door meeting is unknown, sources in London believe that the speech must have addressed British-Soviet talks. The British censorship authorities' extremely strict censorship of the news of Churchill's visit to the Soviet Union is likely intended to increase the element of surprise when the news is officially announced. At the same time, some sources claim that all the official reports about the Second Front are just a smokescreen to cover up Churchill's visit to Moscow.

### Japanese Army Reforms Javanese Administrative Institutions

Batavia, 4th, Allied News Agency: The Japanese military administration in Java has decided to undertake fundamental reforms of Java's administrative institutions.

### Indian Congress Party Executive Committee Passes Indian Independence Resolution Draft: Gandhi Suggests Negotiations with Japan, Original Proposal Passed After Nehru's Amendment

Lisbon, May 5th, Allied News Agency – Gandhi submitted a draft resolution to the All-India National Congress Executive Committee on April 27th, arguing that after Britain grants India independence, India should first begin negotiations with Japan. The National Congress Executive Committee met yesterday in Bombay to discuss the case. The atmosphere was extremely tense. Nehru proposed an amendment, which was immediately passed by the Executive Committee. The gist of the amendment was that those involved are not India but the British Empire. India has no hostility towards Japan or any other country. What India seeks is complete freedom. The amendment strongly criticized the Cripps proposal, saying it fully exposed the true face of British imperialism. Britain is now powerless to defend India, and all its actions are only for its own defense.

Lisbon, May 5th, Allied News Agency – According to New Delhi, after the All-India National Congress Executive Committee met in Bombay to discuss and pass the "Britain Should Quit India" proposal with amendments, the Indian Defense Council is scheduled to meet from September 7th to 9th, chaired by the Governor-General of India, Lord Linlithgow.

New Delhi, May 4th, Havas – It is learned that Mahatma Gandhi has submitted a suggestion to the Indian National Congress Party, believing that the first action of a free India should be to negotiate with Japan.

Lisbon, May 5th, Allied News Agency – According to reports from Bombay, Mahatma Gandhi gave a ninety-minute speech to the Congress Executive Committee this morning, discussing the "Quit India" resolution in a broad sense. The Executive Committee further considered the national political situation and domestic and international reactions. At the same time, Chairman Acharya stated that the matter would be discussed for two or three days, and that in addition to the Wardha resolution, resolutions on other Indian political situations would also be discussed.

Bombay, May 5th, Havas – According to well-informed sources here, the All-India Congress Standing Committee met this morning and discussed a resolution stipulating that Mahatma Gandhi should be fully authorized to launch a civil disobedience movement if Britain refuses to withdraw from India. After the meeting, a reporter asked Gandhi whether he advocated starting peace negotiations with Japan after Britain withdrew from India. Gandhi replied that his advocacy remained unchanged.

Gandhi's Proposed Motion

New Delhi, May 4th, Havas – Mahatma Gandhi has submitted a proposal to the National Congress Executive Committee, arguing that the first action of a liberated India should be to negotiate with Japan. The original text of the proposal is translated as follows: "Sir Stafford Cripps, Minister of the British Cabinet, came to India this spring and proposed a wartime internal affairs plan for Britain. After studying it, the National Congress Executive Committee believed that this plan was merely a depiction of British imperialism, and made the following decisions: The Executive Committee believes that British power is insufficient to defend India, and Britain's actions are only for its own defense. The current conflict between Britain and India is due to Britain's differing views on defense from ours. In addition, the British government has no confidence in any political party in India. The main purpose of British troops stationed in India is to keep India permanently subjugated and to isolate the Indian army from the people. The Indian people cannot recognize this army as their own. Britain is still adopting this policy of distrust and refuses to hand over issues related to Indian national defense to Indian representatives. Japan has no dispute with India; it is at war with the British Empire. India's participation in the war was not approved by representatives of the Indian people but was purely the result of British actions. As soon as India regains its freedom, its first task should be to negotiate with Japan. The Executive Committee believes that if British troops can withdraw from India, even if Japan or any country invades our country, our people will be able to defend themselves. Therefore, it firmly advocates that British troops should withdraw from India immediately. The princes of various tribes do not need to worry about a free India. The so-called majority and minority ethnic issues within India are purely fabricated by the British government. Once the British withdraw from India, this problem will disappear without a trace. The Executive Committee, in view of the above reasons, asks the British to immediately lift their restrictions on India, even if they do not abandon all their territories in Asia and Africa. The Executive Committee is willing to provide assurances to the Japanese government and people that India has no unfriendly feelings towards Japan or any other country. India only wants to eliminate all foreign rule. India is fighting for freedom and does not need any foreign military assistance. Our country will obtain freedom through the power of 'non-violence' and maintain freedom in the same way. If we judge by the recent attitude adopted by the British government, we can know that Britain does not want us to assist it, but only wants us not to interfere. In other words, the assistance that Britain needs from us is only what slaves do. As for the scorched earth policy, there is no need to issue a statement. If any of our land falls into Japanese hands, we still do not want to destroy our grains, food, and reservoirs, because we still hope to recover the lost land in the shortest possible time. However, the destruction of ordnance is another matter. In short, our party cannot agree to the destruction of people's property or other things that are beneficial to the masses. Although the wartime non-cooperation movement will be limited to a small number of people, in order to achieve complete independence, millions of Indians still need to cooperate to determine and implement a construction plan to awaken the entire nation from its dream. Whether the British withdraw from India or not, we must engage in the following tasks: , eradicate unemployment, , eliminate the gap between rich and poor, , resolve social unrest, , eliminate the bad habit of numbness, , eliminate banditry, , guide the people to ensure a peaceful life. If the people of the whole country cannot recognize the importance of this plan, then our talk of freedom will only be a dream. Whether by violence or non-violence, freedom will never be realized. The party firmly believes that the presence of foreign troops within Indian territory will inevitably harm Indian interests and is a major crisis threatening Indian freedom. The Executive Committee hereby appeals to the British government, requesting Britain to withdraw its troops from Indian territory and no longer send new troops to India. It is ridiculous that our country, with its large population, still needs foreign troops to be sent to India. The immorality of British imperialism can be seen here. One."

Sapru Talks About the Round Table Conference

Bombay, Havas, May 4th – Sir Tej Bahadur Sapru, leader of the pro-British Liberal Party of India, told the press today, "I have not despaired, because there are various reasons to believe that Gandhi will accept the invitation to participate in the round table conference held by Indian political party leaders. I believe that it is most appropriate for Gandhi himself to initiate and convene this meeting, so I am calling on him to do so."

Lisbon, May 4th, Allied News Agency – The All-India Committee of the National Congress Party is about to be held. Gandhi's attitude is the key to the Indian issue and has attracted much attention. According to news from Bombay, Tej Bahadur Sapru of the Indian Liberal League suggested on July 25th that leaders of Indian political parties and groups convene a round table conference to discuss and resolve the Indian issue. Gandhi has sent a letter on the 4th to express his support. Sapru immediately replied to Gandhi, advocating that the invitation to the round table conference be issued in the name of Gandhi, the elder of the National Congress Party, the largest political party in India. If necessary, he is prepared to co-sign with Gandhi. In addition, Sapru has separately invited Nehru, the Muslim League of the National Congress Party, and the Hindu League of India, and other faction leaders to participate in the round table conference. Sapru also hinted that if convening a round table conference in this way fails, the Governor of India and the Administrative Council should be responsible for convening it.

Britain Suddenly Announces Gandhi's Original Proposal

Lisbon, May 4th, Allied News Agency – According to sources from Bombay, before the All-India Committee of the National Congress Party is held on the 7th, the Indian government suddenly announced today the discussion content of Gandhi's proposal on negotiations with Japan, which was put forward on April 27th when the Executive Committee of the party was held in Wardha. This proposal on negotiations with Japan was drafted by Gandhi with all his heart after his hunger strike for the liberation of India. In order to achieve the goal of Indian independence, this is indeed the most appropriate policy. The proposal implies that the first step to liberate India must be to negotiate with Japan. The Indian government suddenly announced it, which is a British plot to leave Gandhi and Nehru, the two giants of the National Congress Party. It is worth paying attention to. The main points of the announced Gandhi proposal are as follows: According to the Executive Committee's view, Britain has no power to defend India and does not trust Indian parties and the general public. This distrust remains unchanged. Japan has no intention of competing with India, but is waging war against Britain. Moreover, India's participation in the war was not approved by Indian national representatives and was entirely the action of Britain. In the liberation of India, the first step is to have more contact with Japan. If Britain withdraws from India, India will defend itself against foreign enemies. However, the British claim to protect the princes of India and advocate staying in India not only verbally but also as proof that Britain is determined to continue to restrict India. The committee assures the Japanese government and the Japanese people that India has no hostility towards Japan or other countries. According to Reuter's report from Bombay on the 4th, the Indian government stated that the most vehement opponent of Gandhi's proposal was Nehru, who said that the proposal would give all countries in the world the impression that we are inclined to the Axis powers, so he hoped for careful discussion. However, some committee members also agreed, but the committee finally supported Nehru's discussion and rejected the proposal.

Bangkok, May 5th, Haitong News Agency – A New Delhi dispatch states that the Indian government released three original proposals of the resolution proposed by Gandhi last night, including "After India is liberated, the first step is to negotiate with Japan," etc. Nehru strongly opposed the proposal in the debate of the National Congress Executive Committee. As a result, the Executive Committee adopted a decision that was slightly milder than the original proposal.

Washington Silent, Berlin Attentive

Lisbon, May 5th, Allied News Agency – According to Washington, President Roosevelt is unwilling to express whether or not he agrees with Gandhi's claim that the United States should advise Britain to withdraw from India.

Berlin, May 4th, Havas – The German Foreign Ministry issued a semi-official statement to foreign reporters today, stating that it is paying close attention to the development of the political situation in India. At the same time, political figures believe that there is a crisis in India at any time.

### American Troops Stationed in British Territory Enjoy Extraterritorial Rights, London's House of Commons Passes After Fierce Debate

London, May 4th, Havas – The House of Commons passed a bill today stipulating that American troops stationed in British territory shall enjoy extraterritorial rights, and all lawsuits shall be handled by American courts. The bill caused a heated debate before its passage. Some members of Congress expressed their opposition, arguing that the bill violated the British constitution and was virtually forced by Washington. The bill has been passed by the House of Lords and will take effect once King George VI signs and promulgates it.

Stockholm, Sweden, May 5th, Haitong News Agency – According to news from London, the British House of Commons passed the government's proposed bill on third reading yesterday afternoon, that is, American troops in British territory may establish courts in accordance with American law to try all cases. The bill has now been passed by the House of Commons and will become law with the King's signature.

London, May 4th, Havas – The government recently proposed a bill arguing that officers of the Headquarters Defense Force should have the right to ride first-class trains, with the same treatment as officers of the expeditionary force. The bill was discussed by the House of Lords and, after a short debate, Labour leader Lord Strabolgi requested a vote, which was rejected by a majority of twenty-six votes. According to the British parliamentary system, only the House of Commons is allowed to express a vote of no confidence in the government. Members of the House of Lords do not have this right, so the House's vote is purely a "hollow" gesture. The government only suffered a "technical" defeat.

### Case of Personnel Working for Germany, US to Issue Statement

At that time, I or Secretary O'Reilly will issue a declaration and make a statement on this case."

### Swiss Commander-in-Chief Gives Speech Encouraging Young Men and Women to Do Their Best to Defend Their Country

Bern, Switzerland, May 4th, Havas – Swiss Federal Army Commander-in-Chief General Guisan gave a speech to a youth group here, stating that today's Switzerland is eager to maintain its century-old tradition of independence and freedom. Once the current war ends, a new Europe will be created. At that time, Switzerland will naturally occupy the position that all free and independent nations should have. Young people should recognize their current main task, which is to defend the motherland. Young women should always abide by women's morals, so as to become good wives and mothers, and must have the ability to replace men's work, so that soldiers can have no worries when they go out to fight in the future. The people of the country should not be frustrated by the current situation, nor should they listen to propaganda from foreign countries, but should maintain the inherent self-esteem of our nation, live in harmony, share weal and woe, follow the example of the sages, and regard sacrificing for the country as supreme glory.

### Mysterious Egypt (8)

Before 1857, Egypt still grew tobacco. At that time, there was a British consul who thought that Egyptian farmers were addicted to tobacco because of growing tobacco, so the government should find ways to improve it. Ali accepted his advice and ordered a ban on tobacco cultivation. By 1879, there were only 1,500 smokers left in Egypt, and a year later, no Egyptians smoked cigarettes anymore.

The most prosperous industry in Egypt is the tour guide business. In European and American countries, there is such a business, and Switzerland's income is entirely due to foreigners coming to visit and appreciate. Although Egypt is not as good as Switzerland, this tour guide business can also rank second in the world.

Generally, Europeans often come to Egypt in winter to escape the cold. They can both mourn the ancient monuments of Egypt and breathe its dry air to strengthen their bodies. People with lung disease are even more suitable for recuperation. Sunlight and yellow sand are two good medicines prescribed by doctors.

In the past, only the wealthy and those with free time could go to Egypt to play, because transportation was inconvenient, expenses were high, and the journey was difficult. In 1869, the Egyptian railway could reach Aswan directly from the Mediterranean, which made it possible for the middle class and busy people to have the opportunity to visit.

If you go to Egypt to play, you can first spend thirty francs to buy a "Guide to Egypt", which has detailed explanations of all the ancient monuments, and detailed guidance on taking buses, staying in hotels, eating, etc. on the way. After you land, there are guides to recruit everywhere. They are all natives. They speak French most fluently, and English and Italian are also good. They can also cope with Greek and German.

Egypt is a British territory. Why do Egyptians speak French best? This can also be regarded as a miracle, right? Or is it because of Napoleon's expedition, the French established a small foundation in Egypt. There are many businesses run by the French in Egypt: there are schools, banks, and factories; Cairo's two main newspapers were also founded by the French.

On Egypt's import and export list, the largest number is always cotton: more than 80-90% of exports are cotton, and cotton yarn and cloth rank first among imports. Other exports with more are cigarettes and sugar cane, and imports include tobacco, coal, gasoline, wood, steel, etc. The most frequent exchanges with Egypt are with Britain, followed by the United States, Germany, France, Russia, etc.

Today, in the war-torn Egypt, not only does it geographically control the key points of Africa, but it is also a fortress on the Mediterranean coast. The Suez Canal between the Sinai Peninsula and the Egyptian mainland is a common thoroughfare between Asia, Africa and Europe. Economically, it is also an important cotton producing area, so it has been a place of contention for military strategists since ancient times.

The current ruling King of Egypt is a young and enterprising enlightened monarch. He is only twenty-two years old this year and is named Farouk. In 1938, he and Britain signed a British-Egyptian agreement in Egypt. In name, Egypt has become an independent country. On January 20, 1938, he married Farid, the daughter of the vice-president of the Egyptian Joint Court (see the copper engraving published in this newspaper on July 26). This queen was not born into aristocracy, but Farouk was able to abandon the old etiquette and combine with her in free love, which shows that this monarch admires civilization and has an enterprising and non-conservative character. He himself has been baptized by Western civilization's science, loves freedom and loves the people, and the people also love him very much. On the day of his wedding, 100,000 poor people in Cairo were given meat by the King of Egypt, and the people wanted to see the new queen's appearance, so they flocked into the palace regardless of everything.

### Infected Houses to be Locked Down by Authorities: Residents Strictly Prohibited from Entering or Leaving During Lockdown, Baojia Personnel to Provide Food

The Shanghai Municipal Council's Information Office announced: "In view of the recent cholera outbreak in the city, in order to isolate the locations where cholera is found from nearby houses and prevent the spread of the epidemic, it has been decided to take the following measures: Houses where cholera is found shall be locked down for five days. No one may enter or leave during the lockdown period. Once a house is locked down, Baojia personnel shall provide food to support the residents inside. Feces from locked-down houses shall be removed by the Public Works Department, and bodies shall be transported when necessary. Disinfection work shall be carried out in the house to prevent the epidemic. Although the implementation of the above measures may cause inconvenience to a very small number of citizens, it is necessary for the health of the majority of citizens. This is hereby announced."

Refusal of Entry to the Concession Without a Disease Prevention Certificate

The Shanghai Municipal Council recently issued Announcement No. 6032, stipulating that from the 6th of this month, anyone who does not carry a formal and valid disease prevention certificate will not be allowed to enter the Public Concession. The locations for injecting disease prevention vaccines in the concession have been announced in Announcement No. 6023, and have also been published in this morning's newspapers. Citizens are asked to pay attention.

Thirty-Five Patients in One Day

The English-language "Shanghai Times" reported that according to reporters, eighteen new cases of cholera were discovered in the Public Concession this Monday. According to the Health Bureau, one of the patients was a foreign national. Since July 6, this is the fourth foreign national to be infected. Seventeen people were also found to be infected in the French Concession on the same day. Therefore, the total number of cholera cases discovered on Monday in the two concessions was thirty-five.

Total Number Exceeds Three Hundred in Two Concessions

Yesterday, officials from the health departments of the two concessions revealed that nearly 80% of cholera cases originated in the Chinese-administered areas and then spread to the two concessions. The total number of infections this year is not yet accurately reported in the Public Concession, but the numbers are not likely to be too different from the approximately 170 cases in the French Concession. Of the 170 epidemic cases in the French Concession, 98 have been definitely determined to be cholera, and another 72 still need to be carefully analyzed.

Satisfactory Results Achieved in Disease Prevention

Officials from the health departments of the two concessions told reporters yesterday that they are now quite satisfied with the progress of disease prevention injections. Since March, 2.5 million people have been vaccinated. Officials from the Public Concession Health Department said that more than 1.5 million people have been vaccinated in the district, and the French Concession Health Department has also vaccinated 1 million people. The reason why the number of vaccinations is increasing day by day is that all the main roads in the French Concession must check disease prevention certificates. In particular, citizens entering the French Concession from the Nanshi district must show their injection certificates. If they fail to show them, they will be forcibly vaccinated.

### Secondary Repatriation Matters - Preparations Begin

The English-language "Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury" reports that after the completion of the first repatriation ship to depart Shanghai for Lourenço Marques for the mutual repatriation of civilians with the British side, Japanese and Swiss officials in this city are this morning starting preparations for the second repatriation ship, the Kamakura Maru. According to reports, this ship is scheduled to depart on August 16th, carrying repatriated civilians.

The Repatriation of Civilians from This City This Time

The Ryuta Maru is currently heading towards its first anchorage, Saigon. The civilians it carries are from Japan, Manchuria, Korea, the Philippines, and Japanese-occupied areas of China. The Kamakura Maru, scheduled to arrive here on August 16th, will, according to the Japanese Consulate, carry 530 civilians from this city. Japanese and Swiss officials are now beginning to compile the list of repatriated civilians for this voyage. However, due to the frequent imposition of naval blockades by various governments, the exact details will not be clear until the actual day of repatriation.

Diplomatic Officials to Leave Along with Repatriated Civilians

It is understood, however, that the repatriated civilians will include officials from the British and other Allied consulates and diplomatic corps in Shanghai. Ten officials from the former Shanghai Municipal Council who were dismissed before their removal from office will also be leaving. Mr. Phillip, the former secretary and councilor of the Shanghai Municipal Council, will also be repatriated this time.

### Red Alum Lacks Sales - Scheme for Fraud

The Tongcheng Company, located at 169 Museum Road, is owned by a Russian named Bai Lang. The company has a large quantity of red alum in stock, but due to the lack of a market, Bai Lang devised a scheme. He colluded with a Chinese man named Chen Shiying to falsely claim to be from Nanjing and to be purchasing red alum, ordering 300 pounds of red alum from the Jinshan Foreign Firm at 51 Guangdong Road. The price was set at $250 per pound, with a deposit of $4,250 paid in advance. This deposit was also provided by Bai Lang to Chen for transfer. Bai did this because he knew that the Jinshan Foreign Firm did not have this product and would undoubtedly purchase it from elsewhere. As Bai expected, Jinshan did buy 300 pounds of red alum from Tongcheng at a price of $210 per pound. After paying and taking delivery of the goods, they prepared to deliver them to Chen Shiying. Unexpectedly, Chen suddenly canceled the order with the Jinshan Foreign Firm. The firm, realizing that there was no market for this red alum and that the market price was far lower, questioned why Chen was willing to pay such a high price at the time. They became suspicious and reported it to the Central Police Station. Detective O'Shaughnessy and Chinese Detective Lang Zuyin investigated and uncovered the whole scheme, and learned that Bai Lang had promised Chen a reward of $5,000 after the deal was completed. Chen and Bai Lang were both arrested. Because some facts were still unclear, they were detained for further investigation and handling.

### The Entire City is Boiling - Unbearable Heat - 103.3 Degrees Yesterday - Drought and Water Depletion Severely Impact Autumn Harvest

The heat in this city is increasing unabated. According to historical records, the highest temperature yesterday was 103.3 degrees Fahrenheit, only slightly lower than in 1924 (note: the highest temperature in 1934 was 106 degrees). With calm winds, the intense heat is even more unbearable. The entire city is seething, and everyone is sweating profusely.

Xiangsheng Building Locked Down Yesterday

Due to the sustained heat, the number of true cholera cases is increasing. Cases have also been discovered in the International Settlement. For example, at the Xiangsheng Building at 800 Beijing Road, a cholera patient was discovered. The Lao Zha Police Station has posted a notice outside the building, stating: "This building has a cholera patient. Citizens are prohibited from entering or exiting." Chinese constables are guarding the locked iron gate.

Rivers and Crops Are Both Affected

The effects caused by the heat include inland river transportation being disrupted because of water depletion, making it impossible for boats to navigate in many places. The rice crops in the fields are damaged by the scorching sun. In fields far from rivers or where irrigation is inconvenient, even if water is drawn for irrigation, it is impossible to provide enough. Therefore, a reduction in the autumn harvest is already apparent. Generally, farmers in the countryside are following old customs, welcoming the dragon and praying for rain, and their emotions are extremely uneasy.

### Notorious Robbers Convicted

Sun Jianwen and Xie Decheng, Chinese detectives of the Criminal Division of the Public Concession Police, recently apprehended four notorious robbers, Zhang Jipin, Zhang Dingyuan, Yu Qiusheng, and Xie Zhenkun. They confiscated two pistols and 28 bullets. It was found that the criminals had previously committed crimes such as kidnapping Ji Juemi, the general manager of Hardoon’s Yanghang, and extorting ransom from Xiao Dirun, the owner of the Hollywood gambling den. The cases have been investigated and closed. Yesterday, Jin Qiusheng was sentenced to eight years and six months in prison, Zhang Dingyuan to eight years and two months, and Xie Zhenkun to eight years. The pistols and bullets were confiscated.

Five Blessings Stock Company Opens

The Five Blessings Stock Company, located in the Xinkang Building on Jiangxi Road, is organized by leaders from the financial and industrial sectors.

### The Asia Development Board Discussed Yesterday - Measures to Control Prices - Two Questions Raised for Research

The English-language "The Times" reports, according to Domei News Agency, that in order to quickly implement measures to stabilize prices, the Central China Liaison Department of the Asia Development Board convened representatives of Chinese and Japanese commercial organizations at its Jiangxi Road hall yesterday morning for a meeting to discuss progress. To quickly stabilize prices, they raised two questions for consideration: One is what methods should be used to stabilize prices in Central China, and the other is how to adjust the relationship between Chinese and Japanese commercial organizations and chambers of commerce. The answers to these two questions will be resolved within this month. This matter has also attracted the attention of the general public, who hope that the Asia Development Board will achieve significant results in suppressing price increases in the future. At the meeting yesterday, the deputy director of the Central China Liaison Department of the Asia Development Board stated that the Liaison Department will provide as much assistance as possible to Chinese and Japanese commercial organizations, and plans to use force to assist commercial organizations in the distribution of goods.

### Banks and Money Shops Adopt a Guarantee System for Lending - Guarantors Are Responsible for Repayment - No Accommodation for Those Without Guarantees

In order to prevent the use of bank and money shop funds for speculation, hoarding, and manipulation of prices, the members of the Joint Association of Banks and Money Shops, in addition to strictly handling all lending and adjusting deposit and loan interest rates, have recently decided to adopt a guarantee system for all lending. Mortgage loans must be made by the pledgor, following the provisions stipulated by the association, and a guarantee must be provided by reputable firms or individuals. For long-term credit loans, a promissory note must be issued, specifying the term, interest rate, and amount, with the guarantor responsible for repaying the principal and interest in full upon maturity. For overdrafts, a total overdraft amount must be specified, with the guarantor responsible for repaying the outstanding amount and interest in full at the end of the term. All banks and money shops are now complying with these regulations, and no accommodation will be provided to those without guarantees.

Banks and Money Shops to Comply with the Following Provisions

At the same time, in order to assist the authorities in stabilizing prices and complying with laws and regulations, banks, money shops, and all financial institutions must not provide commodity guarantees for loans to any individual or organization that is not a member of a trade association. Banks, money shops, and all financial institutions must not engage in the buying or selling of commodities. The entry and exit of goods stored in warehouses must be reported to the competent authorities for record. Banks, money shops, and all financial institutions that provide commodity guarantees for loans must report them to the competent authorities for record. Banks, money shops, and all financial institutions must not accept mortgages for daily necessities. Violations of the above provisions will be punished in accordance with laws and regulations.

Previous Loans to be Declared in Compliance with Orders

All previous commodity-backed loans made by banks and money shops, such as mortgage loans, mortgage overdrafts, regardless of the length of the term or the amount, if they have not yet matured, must be declared to the authorities for record in compliance with orders. The following information must be clearly stated: the name, occupation, and address of each borrower, as well as the name of the company or firm and the name of the representative; the amount of the loan; the loan term and maturity date; the name, quantity, and storage location of the guaranteed commodities; whether the loan has been extended and whether any partial repayment has been made. Regarding future commodity-backed loans, the term must not exceed three months. If the original term is less than three months and the borrower requests an extension, the term will be calculated from the date of the loan, deducting three months.

### Rice Shops in the French Concession Continue to be Fined

### Identity Cards in the French Concession Can be Issued Within a Month - Active Distribution in Various Districts

Since the issuance of French Concession resident identity cards began on July 1 at the Central, Mérechal Foch, Pétain, Route Cardinal Mercier, and Dongmen district Baojia offices, the total number has exceeded 100,000. Issuance was temporarily suspended due to the re-issuance of rice purchase permits by the police stations in each district. It has been learned that the offices in each district have now resumed the issuance of identity cards, and the process is progressing smoothly. Most residents in the Central and Route Cardinal Mercier districts have already received their cards. Some residents in the Pétain and Avenue Joffre districts have also obtained them. It is expected that all identity cards in the French Concession will be issued within a month.

### Members of the Rotary Club Provide a Generous Grant to Students - The Base of the Total of 32,000 in Aid Funds is Further Solidified - The Club's Enthusiasm for Charity and Public Welfare is Truly Admirable

The circumstances surrounding the screening examination for the scholarship of this newspaper's benefactor held at the YMCA have been reported in the press. In recent days, many readers have written to the newspaper, noting that due to the urgency of needy students applying for scholarships and the strictness of the screening examination, some young people whose performance is slightly lower may inevitably fail to be selected due to the limited number of scholarships. The colleagues of this newspaper are feeling hesitant, hoping to find a way to comfort the expectations of all students.

Mr. Xu of the Rotary Club Issues a Call to Action

Mr. Xu Datong, chairman of the Standing Committee of the Rotary Club in Shanghai, shared this feeling and deeply desired to enable these students to fulfill their desire to continue their studies. After consulting with the club's standing committee members Lu Shoulun, Liu Minqi, Da Tingqing, Xiao Zhujun, Liu Xingxun, Hu Kuilin, Huang Lijun, Zhao Xifang, Zhang Panshi, Qin Jingcheng, and club members Liu Yougao, Cheng Meisheng, Shen Yaoting, Wang Guozhen, it was decided to make a generous donation. Mr. Xu personally donated 4,000 yuan, and the other gentlemen each donated 2,000 yuan, for a total of 32,000 yuan. In addition to the remaining funds in this newspaper's readers' scholarship fund, Mr. Xu's enthusiasm for helping students is truly admirable. Recalling the previous donations to this newspaper's scholarship fund, the gentlemen of the Rotary Club have fully supported and repeatedly donated funds, the amount of which is considerable. The fact that needy students have been able to continue their studies and pursue further education is greatly due to the contributions of the Rotary Club.

Paper Industry Leaders Enthusiastic About Public Welfare

According to this reporter, the Rotary Club was founded by leaders of the paper industry in Shanghai, with the participation of leaders from other industries. They usually encourage commercial ethics and are enthusiastic about charity and public welfare, which has long been known and is a model for other leisure clubs. The gentlemen of the Rotary Club donated a large sum of money to help students, not wanting to promote it too much. However, my colleagues believe that this righteous act at this time is deeply sufficient to encourage those who come later. It is hoped that all sectors of society will be inspired to rise up, so that the Rotary Club's leadership in the front will be followed by the response of all sectors, and the future of the scholarship fund is deeply dependent. The report of the scholarship donations received yesterday is recorded below:

Yesterday's Donations Broke Records

### The Charity Federation Maintains the Support of the Nursing Home

After the closing of the refugee camps in Shanghai, the remaining 800 or so elderly, weak, disabled, and un-repatriable people are being provided with supplies by the Shanghai Municipal Council and managed by the Charity Federation, named the Nursing Home, and housed in the former Charity Home on North Zhejiang Road. Since the 16th of last month, the Charity Federation has taken over the operation independently. Because the Association has raised tens of thousands of yuan in donations during the period when the Shanghai Municipal Council provided supplies and purchased supplies, it can be maintained for a little over a month. After that, the meals will depend on donations from all sectors of society.

### Miscellaneous News from All Sectors

Residents and factories can apply to the department to sign a maintenance contract. The address is No. 100 Dahua Road, telephone 61161. The service starts today.

Publication of Food and Health: The Shanghai YMCA's health department previously held a nutrition exhibition with excellent results.

Gentry and merchants came to offer their congratulations, and the event was extremely grand.

### Swimming - The Best Exercise in Summer

In the hot summer, the best exercise is swimming. Soak in the cool water, climb out, and sit or lie for a while in the sun on the artificial or natural sand "beach." Even if you can't really swim in the water, it's already healthy enough. What's more, swimming styles such as prone, supine, and diving are also the best whole-body exercises.

Because the human body is slightly lighter than water, good swimmers say that with their mouths closed and heads held high, with their noses out of the water, they can simply float statically on the water. Learning to swim is not very difficult, and the principles are clear.

Speaking of swimming, everyone will not forget "Mermaid" Yang Xiuqiong. Her records, such as the 50-meter freestyle in 36.8 seconds; the 100-meter backstroke in 1 minute and 44.9 seconds (Liang Yongxian set a new record with 1 minute and 39.1 seconds); the 400-meter freestyle in 6 minutes and 45 seconds. At the time, these achievements were very exciting for a woman.

Someone once asked Yang Xiuqiong about her swimming experience. She said very well that to have excellent results in swimming, you must practice constantly every day. Before creating the above records, she had already put in six or seven years of hard swimming work!

Relying solely on a "baptism" in the swimming pool in the summer, or "strolling" in the water like walking on the street, will never allow you to learn well in your lifetime.

Understanding the principles of swimming; paying attention to accurate posture when starting to practice; having someone with swimming experience to guide you; and continuing to practice constantly, these seem to be the necessary conditions for those seeking the skill of "floating and swimming."

Recently, in addition to public bathhouses and public swimming pools, most of the private, group, and commercial swimming pools have not been affected by the war. With the opening of this swimming season, the swimming pools attached to the French General Association, the Westerners' YMCA, the Chinese YMCA, and St. John's University on Fanhangdu Road have opened one after another, and the opening of Zhang Yuan Swimming Pool has shocked many ladies in Shanghai.

Among them, the Chinese YMCA swimming pool has a considerable history. The pool is open from July 1st to the end of August, a total of two months, and is open to various external groups and individuals, men and women, who are interested in water skills training. Over the past month, this small water music house has presented an unprecedented scene of vigorous vitality. Under the planning and direction of Mr. Liang and Mr. Chen, in addition to the adult, student, junior, and women's elementary classes, self-study classes, and intermediate classes, the external groups that have joined include Xinxin, Yinqian, Jingwu, Telephone Company, and Hualian Tonglehui, among others. Every Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday, from 7 pm to 9 pm, is the training time for the Chinese YMCA swimming team. The team has extremely strict requirements for membership, and it is not easy to be selected without advanced swimming skills.

The facilities are relatively simple. The pool has a diameter of 25 meters and a width of 10 meters. There is a diving board and facilities for adjusting and filtering the water around the pool. One day, the author went to visit the pool. The weather was bad that day, and I thought that such bad weather would lead to a disappointing return. Who would have thought that as soon as I pushed open the glass door of the shower room, I heard a rush of water, like ten thousand horses galloping, which was even more intense than the roar of the wind on the road. Stepping on the stone steps in front of the swimming room, I saw water splashing into the sky, heads rising and falling. There were hundreds of people, with strong children accounting for the majority. Naked and unadorned, there was not a single piece of cloth on their heads or waists. The author felt ashamed and ugly among them. According to the manager, the number of people in the women's class and the intermediate class is only dozens in more than ten hours a day, while the student and youth classes often reach two or three hundred people. At that time, it was the hottest time of the day, and the children's genuine and cheerful laughter made people eliminate all their worries.

The facilities at the Chinese YMCA swimming pool are simple, but the cost is quite economical. It is 15 yuan for members and 25 yuan for non-members. Recently, a "Saturday swimming class" has been opened, running from July 26th to August 31st, for a total of six weeks, costing 10 yuan. In today's environment of rising prices for everything, spending a few tens of yuan to enjoy the water life for most of the summer cannot be said to be uneconomical. Moreover, everyone who joins the Chinese YMCA swimming team must undergo a physical examination by a designated doctor in advance. Men or women suffering from infectious diseases, heart disease, or hidden diseases are absolutely refused entry.

Next, we want to change directions and take a tour of the Zhang Yuan swimming pool.

There were not many tourists on the day the author went, and being in a place that was five meters deep was the most suitable location for viewing. Looking to the right, the color of the water gradually deepened, and there were fewer swimmers, and most of them were circling and probing in the water, not daring to break through the waves and swim straight. At that time, the red sun was moving westward, and its afterglow was still strong. The waves reflected the setting sun, forming a strange sight. Most of the tourists wore sunglasses, half of their bodies out of the water, swaying in the middle of the stream, enjoying the last sunbath. The lifeguard, with the eye-catching words "Saver Lie" marked on his chest on the lifeguard stand by the pool, was dozing under the shade of an umbrella. He probably saw the men and women in the pool cuddling and following each other and deeply sighed that there was no place for a hero to use his talents, so he hid himself deeply, rather than neglecting his duties.

According to the person in charge of the garden, the business has been particularly good this season due to the good weather. Except for two heavy rains and one hurricane, it was always full.

The way of swimming is to strengthen the body and get rid of diseases. It is a most meaningful and noble entertainment, as mentioned above. Talking about the matter on its merits, the water music house is ultimately worthy of our support.

### The Living Standards of Chinese Employees (II)

Income

The average monthly income of employee households is 688.38 old legal currency. The head of the household's monthly income is the main item, accounting for 84.96% of the total income. Among them, regular salary is 189.27 yuan, accounting for only slightly more than a quarter of the total income. Various allowances are 355.58 yuan, accounting for half of the total. The monthly income of family members and other benefits, such as rent from surplus houses, interest, dividends, gifts, allowances, board and lodging fees for lodgers, and profits from investment speculation and gambling, are limited in number and do not occupy an important position. The following table shows the percentage distribution of various income items for employee and worker households. The percentage of the head of the household's monthly income is higher in employee households than in worker households, but the percentage of family members' monthly income and other benefits is higher in the latter than in the former.

Percentage Distribution of Monthly Income and Other Benefits per Household

Miscellaneous items are 216.39 yuan, accounting for 24.44%. The four types of expenses per consumer unit are 170.22 yuan per month. The percentage distribution of the four types of expenses varies depending on the amount of income and the level of living. The following table shows the percentage distribution of various expenditure items for employee and worker households.

Two Extortionists Arrested

Wang Jiaju, the Chinese detective of the Jiading Road Police Station, detectives Xu Huanqing and others, previously arrested five criminals: Lu Zhenhuan from Pudong, Jiang Shichuan from Haimen, Xia Genlin and Zhu Shouming from this city, and Ma Jinhua from Changzhou. It has now been found that Zhen Jiang and others wrote a threatening letter on July 25 of last year to Ding Houqing, the owner of the Fuxing Tobacco Company at 521 Macau Road, threatening to throw explosives to extort 500,000 yuan. Yesterday, they were escorted for interrogation. The police requested the release of Xia, Zhu, and Ma, as no connection was found. After interrogation, Lu and Jiang were ordered to be detained for further verification at a later date.

### Second Suicide Case in Gujiazhai Park

Zhang Deliang, a young man from Yangzhou, 21 years old, committed suicide by taking poison in the French Park of Gujiazhai on the night of the 3rd. At 5:45 a.m. the next morning, he was found asleep on the grass, unconscious. West Patrolman No. 149 discovered him, reported to the police station, and he was taken to Guangci Hospital, but it was too late to save him. He died at 3:30 p.m. The body was taken to the coroner's office, and no family was found. Yesterday, the charity association prepared the body for burial, awaiting relatives to claim it. This marks the second suicide in the aforementioned French park.

### Sharp Decline in Chinese Stocks - Epidemic in the Securities Building - Government Bonds Market Temporarily Suspended

Yesterday, the Chinese stock market experienced a sharp decline. The Chinese Securities Building was closed and disinfected due to an epidemic, forcing the government bond market and Yongchang, Xingye, and other stock companies to temporarily suspend business. This resulted in a lack of formal market prices, making it even more difficult to balance supply and demand for other stock companies. With very few transactions and general clients eager to sell, market prices were overly suppressed. As a result, the Great China Match Company suffered the most severe decline, reaching a low of 177.5 yuan, ultimately closing down by more than ten yuan. The Yong'an Department Store saw a low price of 130 yuan, eventually rebounding but still closing down by five yuan. Xinxin and Neiyi both fell slightly by two yuan. Cultural stocks also suffered a setback, with the Commercial Press and China Bookstore each falling by five yuan, Shijie down by two and a half yuan. Only Xin Ya, Min, and Du had active buyers, rising by two yuan. Sino-French and Xin Ya each fell slightly by two yuan, showing weakness. Nanyang Tobacco Company fell by five and a half yuan, Zhabei Water fell slightly by one and a half yuan, and Chinese stocks retreated into the 30 yuan range, also down by one yuan. The market sentiment was unstable. The stock price list for today is provided below:

### Gold Jewelry Prices Continue to Decline

Yesterday, the retail price of gold jewelry at the Daxin Tonghang jewelry store was still listed at 2,200 yuan per tael (with a 350 yuan deduction for purchases), unchanged. The retail price at cash stores was 50 yuan lower, at 2,150 yuan, with a 300 yuan deduction for purchases. Some stores offered a 200 yuan deduction, at 1,950 yuan, which was unusual compared to the inter-dealer price. The inter-dealer price continued to decline, falling below the 1,900 yuan mark. In the morning, it was 1,910 yuan per tael, rising to 1,915 yuan in the morning before sellers pushed it down to 1,880 yuan. At noon, it rose slightly to 1,895 yuan, a difference of 200 to 350 yuan compared to the previous day. Trading volume was light. The price of patterned silver jewelry was still listed at 16 yuan per tael, with an inter-dealer price of 11.23 yuan.

### Discount Rate Reduced by Another Two Points

Yesterday, in the foreign exchange market, Japanese military notes rose and then returned to par. The highest inter-dealer price was 5.555 yuan, later falling back to 5.551 yuan, the same as the previous day. The buying and selling prices at the bank and money exchange stores were further narrowed to 5 li, with a selling price of 5.553 yuan and a buying price of 5.548 yuan.

Yesterday, the clearing rate of the Money Trade Association was reduced by another two points to 1.6 fen. Credit conditions were easing, and newly drawn head bills were being settled with cash.

### Cotton Cloth Prices Plummet

Yesterday, the cloth market experienced an intensified price decline due to tight credit, increased warehouse rents, and numerous rumors. The market continued to decline sharply. The opening price for high-quality cotton cloth was 164.5 yuan, gradually falling to a closing price of 159 yuan. Also, bank orders were at 142 yuan, and Caiqiu fine cloth had sellers at 144 yuan, with Feiyu trading at 142 yuan. The inquiry price for Four Gentlemen woolen fabric remained firm at 6.45 yuan, but sellers soon flooded the market, and the closing price fell slightly to 6 yuan. Factory cloth trading was extremely limited, and the market was quite chaotic. 16-pound Earth coarse cloth was quoted at 164 yuan, and Feihong was at 160 yuan. 9-pound Xinzhi was at 101 yuan, and 12-pound Dapeng fine cloth was at 141 yuan, and Fugui was at 143 yuan, but no transactions were heard. Changshou bed sheets were at 5.4 yuan, Changting at 5.2 yuan, Sanyang woolen fabric at 5.3 yuan, and Mulan bleached cloth at 140 yuan. The opening price for Taohua women's cloth was 147.75 yuan, falling to 136 yuan, a decrease of more than ten yuan per bolt.

### Edible Oil Consumption Decreases

Recently, due to the hot weather, edible oil consumption has gradually decreased. According to the statistics of the Shanghai Edible Oil Wholesale Office, the distribution volume in July was 16,861 dan, a decrease of about 3,000 dan compared to the previous month.

### Mung Bean Sales Remain Good

In the bean market, mung bean sales remained good, and the market continued to rise. Other beans remained stable. 40 bags of Zhangjiakou mung beans were priced at 245 yuan, 90 bags of Qingdao mung beans were priced at 238 yuan, 70 bags of Tianjin tea beans were priced at 230 yuan, 20 bags of Chongming Sha Wan beans were priced at 190 yuan, and 30 bags of Jiading new white broad beans were priced at 116 yuan.

Sweet potato dried sales turned sluggish, and the market showed a lack of upward momentum. Yesterday, 50 bags of Jiangbei sweet potato dried were priced at 106 yuan.

### Soybean Cake Sales in Rural Areas Remain Stagnant

Soybean cake sales in rural areas remained sluggish, but feed sales improved slightly, so the market rose slightly. Yesterday, Shenji cake February Wangu Stack order for 1,000 pieces was priced at 60 to 59 yuan, April order for 500 pieces was priced at 61 yuan, and June order for 1,200 pieces was priced at 62.1 to 62.5 yuan. Also, Jiyong Stack order for April 500 pieces was priced at 64.5 yuan, and Lizi cake May order for 500 pieces was priced at 64.15 yuan.

### Coarse Sugar Slightly Better

After days of gradual loosening, the sugar stock issued by the Sugar Merchants' Cooperative Business Office saw a slight rebound yesterday in the market association's clearing trade, although there was no increase in volume. The opening price for coarse sugar stocks was 299 yuan, up slightly by one yuan, with 500 bags traded. Red sugar stocks were scarce and lacked trading.

### Bamboo Shoots and Bamboo Shoot Skin Are in Season

Fresh and tender green bamboo shoots are suitable for both meat and vegetarian dishes, so since their release, the market price has been tight. Fresh bamboo shoot skin has risen from 1,100 yuan to 1,200 yuan. Other types, such as Tu Ting, are priced at 24 yuan per small basket, and Zaoyuan at 28 yuan, both up by one yuan. Fei Ting is still sold at 20 yuan.

### South Pond Gorgon Fruit Rising

South Pond Gorgon fruit, after being refrigerated, can avoid further spoilage for those that have already been infested and prevent spoilage for those that have not been infested, so those that were refrigerated early have risen by 100 to 200 yuan. Because of their perfect quality, they are in great demand in the market. Ordinary recent sales are at 550 to 500 yuan.

### New Branch Stems - Opening Today

The glutinous rice branch stems, yuan branch stems, and early red branch stems that arrived a few days ago have all been transferred to the warehouses and are scheduled to open today. Because this year's harvest is relatively abundant and the number of arrivals is not small, market prices are not easy to please, and there is only a hope of slight profit.

### Cigarettes Are Dull and Lifeless

The cigarette market is bleak. New British and American goods have some embellishments, but old goods are rarely inquired about. Only Japanese cigarettes are selling well, so dealers are still trading with each other. Prices are also rising without falling. Yesterday's opening prices were 8,250 yuan for Great Britain brand, 5,250 yuan for Old Knife brand, 4,450 yuan for Pinhai brand, 3,150 yuan for Wuhua brand, 3,750 yuan for Fairy brand, 1,450 yuan for Japanese cigarette Golden Gun brand, 1,850 yuan for Golden Building brand, 1,125 yuan for Red Rose, 1,550 yuan for Quanlu brand, 1,550 yuan for 20-stick Quanlu brand, 1,350 yuan for Zhinan brand, 1,500 yuan for National Cigarette Golden Mouse brand, 2,700 yuan for Meili brand, and 30 to 50 yuan for Golden Tower brand. Selling prices vary.

### Tinplate - Plenty of Transactions

The business of 26-gauge tinplate has been very lively recently. Most of it is used for making rollers in textile factories. In the past, the rollers in textile factories were made of 24-gauge tinplate. Due to a shortage of 24-gauge for a period of time, 26-gauge took its place. Moreover, the price of 26-gauge is 10 to 20 yuan cheaper per sheet than 24-gauge, and its use is similar, so factories are still happy to purchase it. Until recently, the 26-gauge variety has also been almost completely exhausted. In the past day or two, it has been impossible to buy entire boxes of goods, and only individual sheets are available, and the number is also not large. In addition, the number of inquiries has been unusually high, and there have been plenty of transactions. In one day, there have been as many as 30 to 40 transactions, which inevitably affects the sentiment of holders. Standard selling prices have continued to increase. Currently, 26-gauge is quoted at 120 yuan per sheet, and 24-gauge is quoted at 140 yuan per sheet, each up by about 20 yuan compared to before.

### Yesterday's Affairs

— Tang Mu

Recently, I went to the office of a great businessman. I saw secretaries and typists coming and going, telephones ringing constantly, and messengers rushing around with letters and packages, fully demonstrating the tense life of a modern city.

During our conversation, we were often interrupted by the ringing of the telephone. I suddenly noticed that on the businessman's desk, under the glass top, there was a delicately printed small card with the words "...but that was yesterday's affair." I felt a little strange and did not understand the meaning of these words.

When the businessman finished his phone call, I unceremoniously asked him the meaning of those words. He said, "These words prevent me from worrying unnecessarily. In the past, I often worried about small things in the past. Later, one night, my eldest son fell ill and had a high fever. The next day, I said to my wife, 'Dear, how worried and scared we were last night!' My wife replied very cleverly, 'But that was yesterday's affair. Today he is out of danger.'"

"These words have always been engraved in my mind. Yesterday's affairs cannot be undone, and yesterday is gone forever. But today belongs to everyone, and tomorrow also belongs to us. The past cannot be saved. But the present and future are full of bright hope. Therefore, I printed some cards and gave them to our staff. You don't know how much these cards have affected the spirit of our staff. Now we are all bravely looking forward. We have no worries about the past. What is the use of grieving and sighing over the ghostly shadows of the past?"

When I left, I took a card with me. Now this card is in front of me, and like paper, pen, and ink, it has become a part of my desk. (Abridged translation from the original work by Toran)

### Mom Goes to Work

— Hui

For the sake of my family and children, I haven't worked outside for quite some time. Recently, due to the high prices, our family life has been under endless threat. Every day we are filled with resentment, depression, and fear, which has made our emotions somewhat chaotic and suffocating! Helplessly, I wanted to find a job to make up for the insufficient living expenses.

Fortunately, I finally found an opportunity, so I became a female clerk in a trading company. After I found the job, my family and my body gave me many problems that I had never expected.

Arriving on time, leaving on time, with a calm attitude, not flustered at all. From the eyes of others, they may think that I am a person who has no family burdens at all, and at the same time has a very good environment. But the truth is quite the opposite.

Summer is especially busier than other seasons. Bathing, washing clothes, and the hot weather make the sleeping time at night shorter, and I want to doze off during the day. I am the mother of three children. I get up at six in the morning, tidy up, wash diapers, wash clothes, go to the market to buy groceries, come back and feed the children some milk, and then rush to the office. The morning buses are especially crowded. Because I have to transfer once to get to the Great World, waiting for the second bus really takes a lot of time. After squeezing in, it is hot and stuffy in the crowd, and there is the smell of sweat everywhere, as if I am making a steamed salted fish.

The work is not very busy, and there is a lot of free time. The office is located in a large building near the Bund, with a constant breeze, like the climate at night at home. Taking other people's money feels like coming here to escape the summer heat. For lunch, I have to spend one more yuan on transportation to rush home to eat. Originally, according to my appetite, I could fill my stomach by adding nine jiao to the one-yuan fare, without having to rush twice in the hot sun; but there is a baby at home who needs to be fed once to keep her from making noise!

After getting off work at five o'clock, there is no time to rest at all, and it can be said that this is the beginning of work: bathing the three children, bathing myself, cleaning up the messy beds and rooms made by the children, holding the children, and sometimes helping my husband with letters and accounts, which is busy enough.

After fatigue takes away my spirit, I still can't sleep well. One time this child pees, and another time the prickly heat itches and needs to be fanned; another time the little girl wants to eat milk; I haven't closed my eyes for long, and the rooster is crowing. Looking at the clock, there is not much time to sleep.

When I get out of bed to find my shoes, my eyes are still drowsy. I have to be busy like this for a whole morning. When I get to the office, it is considered my time to rest.

Ah! A person is really full of contradictions. When I don't have a job, I want a job. After I find one, there are many difficulties that I can't cope with. The job has made me a little more financially sufficient, but I can't stand it mentally. Although there is his mother at home helping me cook and be busy, it is always difficult to take care of the three children well!

Is it good for women to go to society? Or is it better to go back to the kitchen? This unproblematic problem has warmed up again in my mind.

### Precious Nutritious Plants

— Jian Nong

When most people are struggling on the edge of starvation, to talk about these moving, finger-licking, and unattainable precious plants, isn't it like asking people to quench their thirst with plums? But what can I do? The ancients said: "The hungry do not forget food, and the thirsty do not forget drink," and I am also associated with these things under the pressure of worries about running out of food and fuel.

Milk Tree

This belongs to the fig family of plants and is native to South America, especially Colombia. The Oriental Library's Scientific Miscellany describes it as follows: "Wherever the land is extremely bitter and there is a lot of rocky soil, this tree grows. Its leaves, when viewed from the outside, seem dry and no different from leather; this is because there must be months without rain to moisten its roots and branches throughout the year. A kind of white juice grows in the tree, which tastes like milk; ...when the bark is split open with an axe, the juice springs out like spring water and can often fill a bowl; when drunk, it is sweet and palatable, and there is no difference from nutritious milk."

Shea Butter Tree

There are several types of shea butter trees, which are produced in India, Africa, and other places, but the one in equatorial Africa, belonging to the Sapotacee family and named Bassia paukii, is the best. The French Encyclopedia describes it as follows: "...(morphology omitted)... It propagates in the valleys of Upper Senegal and Upper Nigeria, forming a boundless forest. Its fruit is the size of an ordinary walnut and has a multi-lobed and sweet flesh. ...It contains a white kernel in a very hard shell, which, after being squeezed and boiled, provides a white and light yellow milky oil, which has a beautiful flavor and is called Karite shea butter. This vegetable shea butter is as solidified and good as the best animal butter and is commonly eaten by the residents of Nigeria. ...Wrapped in the leaves of the plantain tree, it can last for a long time. ......"

Breadfruit Tree

If someone thinks that milk and shea butter are not enough to fill the stomach, then please look at the breadfruit tree produced in various parts of the South Pacific Islands. This tree belongs to the mulberry family of the jackfruit genus, with a trunk height of 40 to 60 feet and is the most beautiful tree in the tropics. The fruit is round or oval and ranges from four to eight inches in length. The great British naturalist Wallace, in his book "The Malay Archipelago: A Narrative of Scientific Exploration," recorded his travels in the Moluccas in the mid-nineteenth century: "I ... enjoyed an unprecedentedly delicious fruit - a real breadfruit. ...We baked this breadfruit whole in the embers and ate the flesh with a spoon, ...similar to mashed sweet potatoes mixed with milk. ...Sometimes, ...fried into thin slices, ...and mixed with sugar, milk, butter, or syrup, it can be made into a delicious pudding, light and palatable, with a special flavor. ..." Indeed, tropical residents use breadfruit as their staple food, just like we eat rice and wheat.

Sago Palm

This tree, which can truly be called a benefactor to the masses, is called the sago palm and also grows in East India and the South Pacific Islands. The tree is four or five zhang tall, with feather-like and thorny leaves growing at the end of the stem. The strange thing is that it nourishes people, - the thing that sustains the lives of so many people, is not the fruit it bears, but the medulla in its trunk. This medulla can be crushed, washed, and filtered to make edible starch, and each tree can produce 700 pounds of such starch. Wallace said that this starch "can be baked into cakes in small clay ovens, and can also be made into people's sago bread. ...In about five minutes, the sago cake in the oven is baked. These cakes are very delicious with butter, and especially delicious with a little cane sugar and coconut mixed in. This cake is very soft and somewhat similar to cakes made with corn flour. ...Dried sago cakes can be preserved for many years. ..." Wallace also calculated that one tree can make 1,800 cakes, enough for one man's food for a year.

Cacao Tree

Finally, to add icing on the cake, please let Shanghai's hungry masses not forget the cacao tree, which originated in Mexico and whose fine powder can now be bought in Shanghai. The ancient Mexicans called this cacao powder "divine food": "One only needs to eat a bowl of this precious melt to be able to walk all day without having to eat other food!" If you don't believe me, please try it!

Medicine

### Shortwave Heat Therapy

— Zhang Qiao

The development of medicine has entered a stage where it no longer relies on drug treatment. Many doctors are using psychological treatment and other instrumental treatment methods. There has also been similar progress in veterinary medicine. Some cattle ranches and veterinary hospitals in the western United States are using shortwave heat to treat injured and sick livestock, with significant results. Wavelengths between three and five degrees are connected to rubber bands and tied to the injured area, so that waves can treat the injured part. This treatment was first applied to cattle, and now shortwave heat therapy has been applied to other animals.

### Sharing the Same Boat in Storms

— He Jia Zhi

(7) Swift Thunder

Second Mrs. Ye said, "Besides Cheng Bing, who else could it be? Because your father returned wounded, before dawn, he sent someone to Ant Mound Town to find Cheng Bing. The person sent was quite strong and quite eloquent. Who knew that upon inquiring in Ant Mound Town, Cheng Bing had moved house half a year ago, and no one knew where he had moved to. Judging from this, Cheng Bing had planned this long ago. He only did this because he could not marry your mother, and because he had a few conflicts with your father. He carefully plotted this poisonous scheme. Oh! Your mother told me that after your father passed away, Cheng Bing sent another letter, using a pseudonym of a deceased woman. The letter contained a lengthy argument that remarriage for women is not forbidden, asking your mother to write back to him. The return address seemed to be in Jiaxing. Your mother burned the letter. This clearly shows that Cheng Bing is indeed the murderer." Wei Cheng slammed the table and said, "So, this Cheng Bing is in Jiaxing. Why didn't my mother discuss this with me? After I turned eleven or twelve, I felt I had some ability to think. He sent those letters before and after, and she put them all aside. I would have had a way to deal with it." The teacup on the table jumped up from Wei Cheng's slamming the table, and all the tea splashed on the table.

Second Mrs. Ye, having spoken to this point, also felt a bit strained, leaning back on the chair and waving her hand at Wei Cheng. Wei Cheng said, "Aunt, I can show you the will. My mother doesn't stop me from seeking revenge." Cui Zhen interjected from the side, "Brother Cheng, you really need to think this matter through carefully. Now, we don't know where this Cheng is hiding. Even if we find him, we don't know what kind of person he is now. It would be very dangerous for you to go alone. It's a pity that people say I am a woman, but in reality, this woman of mine is no less than a man. Brother Cheng, if you want to send me anywhere, I will go. If I were to refuse, then I would not be considered a woman raised in the Ye family of Shide Hall." Cui Zhen also appeared righteous and resolute. (147)

### Weaver Girl of the Milky Way

— Lü Huanxiang

Eternally Continuing

We are a group forgotten by society, hiding in the corners of the factory all day and night, spending our days and wasting our youth in the deafening and noisy sound of the looms. "Covering the world with clothing" is our noble work purpose; "Wu silk and Yue brocade" are the fruits of our hard work.

What kind of people are we? I'm afraid readers may not understand yet? We are not the "Silk Sisters of West Lake" whom the general public calls "Ah Jie," nor the "Spinning Mill Grannies" called "Po," but we are their companions. We are a group of silk weaving female workers in silk factories. However, we don't have any elegant name. I remember someone once called us "Weaver Girls of the Milky Way," which sounds quite nice; according to the story, she is indeed our first ancestor.

When the呜呜 whistle sounds at dawn, the good dreams of the weaver girls are awakened, and at the same time, more sleeping people are awakened, but the weaver girls cannot hate it like other people, just turn over and fall asleep again to continue their good dreams. All the weaver girls can only rub their sleepy eyes and immediately hurriedly put on their clothes. The remaining stars and moon outside the window still linger beside the dressing table facing the window, as if they were my old friends, waiting to say good morning to me, and as if saying: "You're up, I have to go back too, goodbye!"

At the dressing table, we only slightly tidy up our sleep-tousled hair. We don't need to apply powder or lipstick; we don't wear high-heeled leather shoes or flesh-colored stockings; a short blue serge gown, surrounded by a white half-coat, this is our dress. There is no nobility like that of a nurse, which makes people admire us, nor the beauty of a waitress, which makes people find us lovely.

After a hasty breakfast, it is already dawn, but the sun has not yet risen, and we have to rush to the factory in groups of three or five. At the same time, the partners who have finished their night work are also supporting their tired bodies back to the dormitory to have a sweet dream, preparing to recover from their fatigue so that they can continue the unfinished work of the day shift workers after the sun goes down. In this way, it continues forever, and there is no rest except on the new moon and full moon.
