### Kharkov Tank Battle: Soviet Forces Break Through German Defenses, Simultaneous Victory on the Lenin Front, Germans Claim to Have Occupied Kerch

Berlin, 16th (Haitong Agency) – The Führer's headquarters announced in an official report today that Kerch has been occupied by German forces. After defeating fierce enemy resistance, German troops broke into Kerch yesterday, and the city and harbor are now in German hands.

The German High Command recently issued a special communiqué stating that the enemy forces attacking fiercely around Kharkov were engaged by our troops for a period of time before being repelled. Our counteroffensive was unexpectedly successful and made considerable progress.

Berlin, 16th (Haitong Agency) – Kerch, captured by German forces yesterday, is the second largest city in Crimea, after Sevastopol. It has a population of 70,000 and is located at the entrance to the Sea of Azov, at the tip of the Kerch Peninsula. Due to its favorable location, it has become an important transportation center between the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov in the last decade. There is a large iron smelting factory there, and there are many oil wells nearby. The Kerch Isthmus is about 40 kilometers long and only three kilometers at its narrowest point, which can control the old Yenikaleh Fortress and the new Paul Fortress. The oldest building in Kerch is the Church of St. John, built in the eighth century.

Moscow, 16th (Reuters) – In the first tank battle of the year in the Kharkov area, the victory belongs to the Soviet forces. The Soviets mobilized a large number of elite troops transported by tanks, equipped with automatic weapons, and protected by accompanying infantry. The German side used new types of aircraft.

London, 16th (Reuters) – World attention remains focused on the German offensive against Kerch. According to recent Soviet reports, the fighting there is still very fierce. As for the Soviet army's offensive against Kharkov, it has occupied several important plateaus. According to a Moscow radio broadcast last night, the Red Army has driven back the German army at several key points on the Kharkov front. The German army suffered heavy casualties, and eight artillery pieces and other military equipment were captured. The radio announcer also said that the Red Army is still advancing, and one Red Army unit unexpectedly crossed the German artillery fire line and captured three bunkers. Soviet tanks were particularly effective. One team captured two artillery pieces, and another team captured fifteen anti-tank guns. As for the war situation in the Northwest, the Leningrad radio station announced last night that the German army suffered heavy losses in the Leningrad front, and thirteen tanks, eleven artillery pieces, and a large number of military equipment were seized.

London, 16th (Reuters) – The Soviet forces led by General Timoshenko are continuing to advance towards Kharkov after defeating the German army in a major tank battle, having broken through the outer lines of the city. They are now taking full advantage of their gains, with fierce fighting continuing throughout the night. The atmosphere in this area is not particularly conducive to land and air warfare, but Moscow hopes the weather will improve, as continuous rain will cause rivers to flood. Fresh Soviet troops are now being rapidly transferred to participate in the Kharkov offensive. Soviet air forces are providing protection to the land forces. Confirmed news has come from the German border that Timoshenko's troops have broken through the first line of defense in Kharkov, and fighting is taking place near the railway station in the northeast of the city. The Soviet offensive to the north and south of the city is expanding and developing on the front lines. There is also fighting along the entire line between Belgorod and Zmiev. London officials claimed today that the Soviet attack around Kharkov is clearly progressing smoothly, and the attack is likely taking place on a 50-mile front between Volchansk and Chuguev, with the main force of the attack appearing to be in the south of the line. The German side may be able to quickly deploy fresh troops, as the German forces on that line are supplied from Kiev, with railways and highways leading to all parts of the front. The German 17th Army in the Kharkov area is commanded by General Hollidt. According to a Reuters correspondent in Moscow, the first tank battle of the year took place near Kharkov, resulting in a Soviet victory. General Timoshenko made extensive use of elite troops transported by tanks, all equipped with automatic weapons and closely assisted by infantry. The German side used several new types of aircraft. A Soviet communiqué at noon stated, "Fierce fighting continues on the Kerch Peninsula, and the offensive in the Kharkov area is also in progress." According to news from the German border, the fighting on the Kerch Peninsula has slowed down. Heavy rain has fallen in the past fourteen hours, making the ground muddy. Soviet troops in Yenikaleh, at the northeastern tip of the Kerch Peninsula, have driven the German troops out of the port of Kerch.

### US Representative to India Meets with Gandhi, Johnson to Return Home

### German Stormtroopers: 500,000 Casualties on the Eastern Front

Moscow, 16th (Reuters) – According to broadcasts here, Nazi stormtrooper leader Lutze also admitted that the corps has suffered 500,000 casualties on the Soviet battlefield.

Eastern Front War Analysis: Soviet and German Forces Equally Matched.  Luo Jing (Paris), 15th (Havas Agency) – Military observers here analyze the general situation on the various fronts of the Eastern Front as follows:

In the Kerch Isthmus, the fighting has eased in the past 24 hours, due to heavy rain in the area, which has left the ground flooded, making it impossible for mechanized units to advance rapidly. In addition, last night, a large number of Red Army troops concentrated at the port of Yenikaleh at the eastern end of the Kerch Peninsula, attempting a surprise attack to save the city of Kerch, which was already in the hands of the Axis forces. Only the naval port retained a strong Soviet naval force, which defended its position under the cover of mechanized weapons. After a large-scale bombing by aircraft, the Red Army sent a mixed force of artillery and infantry, and with the cover of light tanks, launched a major counterattack, completely driving out the German troops who had stormed into Kerch. Currently, the German-Romanian allied forces are occupying the heights of Kerch. At dawn today, the Red Army again attacked them, attempting to break through the allied positions, but was repulsed. By noon, the allied forces had launched repeated attacks, attempting to storm into the city again, but were unsuccessful due to insufficient troops. The main force of the attacking army is now fighting south of the Kerch Peninsula. The details of the fighting are only known that the Red Army holds an area of no more than 200 square kilometers on the Kerch Peninsula, and also has a number of defensive positions around some towns, but these positions are not as solid as those in the Kerch Isthmus.

The fierce fighting in the Kharkov area has not yet ended. It is reported that General Timoshenko, commander of the Red Army on the southern front, has been victorious in every battle, cutting the German army's first line of defense in two. It is rumored that the fighting has approached the northeastern suburbs of the city, but this has not been confirmed. According to the German side, the defensive fortifications of Kharkov are not several parallel lines of defense, but a network of fortifications scattered like stars, most of which are deep fortifications. The outer line is about 35 miles from the city. The Red Army has repeatedly attempted to destroy it since last winter. This line of defense is shielded by the left bank of the Donets River. The Red Army managed to cross the river at two points and infiltrate the city's defensive lines, but so far, the inner line has not been breached. Fresh German troops arrived last night to assist in the defense. It is difficult to predict how the situation will change in the future. Reinforcements are arriving from both sides, but it can be said with certainty that General Timoshenko wants to isolate the allied forces concentrated in the Donets region and cut off the transportation lines with Kharkov as the hub.

Germans Use New Weapons to Kill Without Wounds, Stockholm, 15th (Reuters) – According to Swedish volunteers participating in the German campaign, the Germans have tested new weapons on the Soviet battlefield. The new weapon is a large projector that looks like a mine, equipped with compressed air, and other substances are used to increase its air pressure. It is launched using a specially designed gun barrel. The Soviets who die show no visible wounds or noticeable odor. It seems that the Soviet lungs cannot withstand the air pressure and explode. During the initial trial, the Soviets suspected poison gas and immediately threatened retaliation. The Germans were all equipped with gas masks. The second time, during the attack on the Dnieper River, it was used by the spray regiment. Its effective range has a radius of 4,000 meters. When this projector is launched, it makes a whooshing sound. It is now believed that the test has been completed and it can be put to use.

Bern, 16th (Havas Agency) – The German military is very secretive about the new weapons used on the Eastern Front. A representative of the German High Command only stated that the German army now has a completely new weapon that can destroy Soviet heavy tanks that cannot be damaged by ordinary weapons.

### Military Observers: Japan's Strategy Against the US May Include an Attack on Alaska

Washington, 14th – Military observers predict that Japan's next offensive may target Alaska and Hawaii. Since the attack on Pearl Harbor, Alaska may have become a major target. Although there was no action in winter, it is quite possible at this time. US Army Commander in Hawaii, Lieutenant General Emmons, publicly warned that a Japanese attack on Hawaii is still possible. As for Alaska, the Japanese are even more afraid of it being used as a base for attacking Tokyo, Yokohama, and other industrial centers, because the western tip of Alaska is only 250 miles from the Japanese border, and only 1,000 miles from its industrial centers.

San Francisco, 16th (Havas Agency) – Military authorities, considering Alaska to be in a dangerous area and due to inconvenient transportation, have strictly prohibited private travel. This ban also applies to the families of military engineers who are building military bases in Alaska.

Previously, when the US Minister to Romania left office, the people of that country held a grand demonstration to support the Minister.

### General Hardley Appointed Deputy Commander of British Forces in India to Assist Wavell in Handling Military Affairs; Imphal in Eastern India Bombed

New Delhi, 16th (Reuters) – It was officially announced yesterday that General Hardley has been appointed Deputy Commander-in-Chief of India, responsible for the administrative duties of General Wavell, Commander-in-Chief of India, as military affairs in that region are becoming increasingly heavy. General Wavell often has to leave New Delhi to inspect defenses on the front lines, making it increasingly difficult to attend to the routine duties of the Military Member of the Viceroy's Executive Council. Therefore, someone must share the workload, but the final responsibility still rests with him. Deputy Commander-in-Chief Hardley previously served as Commander-in-Chief of India when General Wavell was transferred to Commander-in-Chief of the Southwest Pacific.

Lisbon, 15th (Domei News Agency) – According to sources in New Delhi, Japanese planes bombed the British airfield at Imphal (in Assam, eastern India) on the 15th, destroying 14 British tanks.

### British Army Prepares to Launch Summer Offensive in North Africa; Allied Naval and Air Forces Concentrated in the Near East; Greatly Increased Defenses of the British Isles

Bern, 15th (Havas Agency) –

A neutral observer in Rome told the "Tribune de Genève" that the British army intends to launch an offensive in Libya, North Africa, before the summer of this year, which can be seen from the British efforts to supply Malta at great sacrifice. At the same time, British and American naval and air forces are concentrating in the Mediterranean, Egypt, and the Suez Canal areas, and will continue to send reinforcements and various military equipment to the Middle East. However, Rome does not attach too much importance to the British and American preparations to attack the Mediterranean, as it firmly believes that the British and Americans will encounter significant resistance, and that Japan will seize the opportunity to act in the Pacific, to say nothing of the rest.

London, 15th – The British Dominions continue to send reinforcements to Britain from time to time. In the past few days, ships carrying Dominion troops have arrived in Britain. Canada has sent a number of troops and thousands of naval and air force personnel to Britain, and New Zealand airmen and forest combat teams have also arrived.

### The Martinique Question: US-French Negotiations Continue; Military and Economic Matters are Key Discussion Points; Repatriation of French Warships Underway

Washington, 15th (Havas) - Secretary of State Hull, in a statement to the press, said that Rear Admiral Hoover, representing the US Navy, continues to negotiate with authorities in French Martinique, discussing military and economic issues. Of paramount importance is the restriction on the movement of three French warships currently in Martinique harbor. Negotiations on this matter are reportedly progressing, but resolving various economic issues will take some time. When a reporter asked for clarification on the phrase "French warships cannot be moved," the Secretary of State declined to provide specifics, stating it was a technical matter and directing inquiries to the Navy. He added that other minor military issues are also being discussed and are expected to be resolved gradually.

Lisbon, 16th (Haitong News Agency) - US Secretary of State Hull announced yesterday at an intelligence briefing in Washington that the repatriation of French warships in Martinique is underway and that an agreement on the matter is still under discussion. The utilization of French merchant ships in Martinique is merely a commercial issue, and once other military issues are resolved, it will naturally be easily addressed. Both sides are in a spirit of compromise. Geneva, 15th (Havas) - The US and France are still in talks regarding the issue of the French West Indies. Political figures here find this to be a comforting factor, as earlier this week, some feared a break in US-French relations. Fortunately, both governments have demonstrated a spirit of compromise, averting a crisis. Although the US has stated that decisions on the French side will be made by Lieutenant General Robert, the local authority, French Ambassador to the US Henri Haye and US Chargé d'Affaires in France Duke have also actively participated in the negotiations. Therefore, US-French negotiations are not limited to military issues of a local nature but are also being conducted through diplomatic channels. The US insists on prioritizing local negotiations, while France prefers using diplomatic channels as the basis. In reality, Lieutenant General Robert maintains close contact with the French government. To date, both sides have demonstrated a practical spirit, resolving each issue separately. The initial resolution of the French warship issue is clear evidence of this. The French government intends to agree to US requests that do not conflict with France's legal status in its Western Hemisphere territories. However, it finds it difficult to accept requests that conflict with its obligations under the armistice agreement. Within France, there are many who wish to exploit the difficulties in US-French relations to criticize the government. For example, French Popular Party leader Doriot, in a speech in occupied France on the 13th, publicly opposed the government's policy of compromise with the US. This view contradicts Chief Laval's declaration that France does not want to be the first to take action in the final stage of US-French relations. It is generally believed that any new difficulties between the US and France will be exploited by Doriot and his party. Berlin Maintains Silence. Swiss Capital (Havas)

The Basler Nachrichten's Berlin correspondent reports that German officials remain silent regarding the current state of Franco-American relations, particularly concerning the Martinique issue. The German Foreign Office has only stated that the issue concerns the US and France alone, and that expecting a break in relations is "overly optimistic." The German government has neither put pressure on Vichy nor offered promises of aid to France should it decide to confront Britain and the US. Therefore, whatever may happen, France must initiate the first move; Germany can only offer suggestions. In essence, Germany's attitude is unchanged from when Laval regained power – Germany is still awaiting concrete evidence of France's willingness to participate in the new European order.

### Laval Busily Travels Between Paris and Vichy

Paris, 16th (Havas) - Government Chief Laval abruptly flew to Paris yesterday at noon, immediately holding separate talks with key figures. He then returned to Vichy by mountain road at dawn today to attend an important cabinet meeting in the afternoon.

### Shanghai Municipal Council Volunteer Corps to Implement Police Training; Tasks of the French Concession Civil Police

The Baojia system south of the Suzhou Creek in the Shanghai International Settlement has gradually been established. Currently, there are 32 Lianbao, 400 Bao, 485 Xijia, and 46,338 households with a population of 913,514 residents in the entire seven police districts. The volunteer corps members on daily rotation number 10,450. Recently, in addition to accelerating the issuance of citizen certificates, the Baojia Bureau has also focused on strengthening the Baojia system. It is reported that the Baojia Standing Committee plans to hold its first meeting next week to carefully discuss proposals to strengthen the Baojia's strength, training for the volunteer corps, and other basic policies. Each police station is also scheduled to hold Baojia meetings daily starting on the 20th. It is expected that the authorities will want to reorganize the volunteer corps and provide them with various police training programs to transform them into a genuine public police organization.

Civil Police Organization in the French Concession: To prevent the activities of terrorists and ordinary criminals and to provide maximum security to residents of the French Concession, the French Police Department has designated a reputable Chinese merchant as the section chief in each section of the concession. Residents of that section must cooperate with them at all times. Each designated merchant appoints two deputy section chiefs to work directly with them. The deputy section chiefs then appoint eight or ten assistants, who in turn appoint several sub-assistants to help with the work, ensuring maximum assurance. The second landlord is responsible for all improper activities within the building, and each head of household is responsible for their family living together. The second landlord must fill out two copies of a form listing the names and occupations of each head of household and provide them to the section chief. To enhance the inspection system, a joint guarantee system will be established between heads of household and second landlords. The guarantee must be signed by both parties. For example, a third-party tenant is guaranteed by their second landlord and another third-party tenant. However, if the third-party tenant and the second landlord are not on good terms, the third-party tenant may be exceptionally guaranteed by another second landlord. Each second landlord must be guaranteed by the sub-assistant from their section and another assistant, or by two second landlords. Sub-assistants are guaranteed by their respective assistants and another assistant. In case of difficulty, they may be guaranteed by two assistants or two second landlords. Except for the section chief, deputy section chief, assistants, sub-assistants, and business owners with several staff members, each head of household may not guarantee more than two people. The section chief's task is to have their deputy section chiefs and others investigate individuals possessing weapons or explosives, any suspected criminals running private gambling dens or opium dens, as well as suspicious individuals, and to report regularly to the head of the police station in charge. If there are any improper activities in the house where the second landlord resides, they must report to the section chief. Each head of household must cooperate with the second landlord. If there are instructions from the head of the police station, which were previously received by the section chief, the residents of that section must comply with them. Anyone who provides important information to the police station will be rewarded, with the reward varying depending on the value of the information. Anyone who knowingly fails to report individuals living in their home or nearby who are engaged in illegal activities, or who fails to comply with the instructions received from the section chief, will be severely punished.

### Major Fire in Fahua

Dozens of Boarding Houses and Bamboo Sheds Destroyed: Due to the recent dry weather, fire alarms have been frequent.

### Various Industries Plan to Raise Reserve Funds and Issue Substitute Coupons

Since the panic over small banknotes occurred in the market, shops have posted notices stating that change will only be given for purchases of three yuan or more, or even four yuan or more. Some shops require customers to have the exact amount of the purchase, making it difficult for citizens to buy small items due to the lack of change. Generally, businesses have been giving out substitute coupons as change, and other forms of tokens have also been discovered to replace small banknotes. According to another source, major companies in the city, feeling the inconvenience of the lack of small banknotes, may soon jointly organize a reserve fund committee to uniformly issue a type of substitute coupon to alleviate the current panic. Furthermore, it is reported that tobacco and exchange shops throughout the city, which normally sell small items such as cigarettes, matches, candles, soap, kerosene, and paper goods, mostly priced from several cents to one or two yuan, rely on the circulation of small banknotes and fractional notes in their daily business. Recently, although these shops have managed to exchange for small banknotes after paying a premium, it is still insufficient to provide change, impacting their business and incurring losses. The industry's trade association submitted a request to the relevant authorities yesterday, urging them to find a way to provide relief.

The letter stated that a leader with the surname Wang from a certain organization was experiencing financial difficulties and wanted to borrow 500,000 yuan from the store.

They cooperated with foreign detectives and arrested the three Chens in that room. They confessed that the leader, surnamed Wang, had traveled to Nanxiang to discuss the matter with the three Chens before coming to Shanghai. They rented Room 8 of the Andong Hotel as their base of operations, hoping to get away with it.

### Gradual Streamlining of Supply: No More Panic Over Rice; Newly Established Fair-Priced Rice Distribution Method Goes into Effect Today

Shanghai (Domei) – The Shanghai Municipal Council's change in the method of selling 洋米 (foreign rice) at retail rice shops was decided after careful consideration of the situation. The supply of rice to ordinary people is gradually becoming more widespread. Yesterday, the 16th, the 372 rice shops in the two concessions continued to sell foreign rice using the old method. Although the poor who purchased rice were still crowded, the situation was slightly better because the new method will be implemented in the retail rice shops starting today (the 17th), and there is no more panic about rice shortages. According to sources, the city's food problem is on the right track. The authorities' efforts to streamline the rice supply are gradually being realized. There is no need to worry about the city's rice supply.

New Fair-Priced Method

Starting today (Sunday), the following three new measures will be implemented in rice shops in both concessions: 1. Rice will only be sold on Sundays, Tuesdays, and Thursdays. 2. The retail limit will be relaxed to one and a half Sheng per person. 3. The price of one and a half Sheng of rice will be 5 yuan. All 372 rice shops in both concessions will sell rice to ensure widespread availability. More than 10,000 bags of rice have been allocated for sale next Tuesday.

### Rising Trend of Raw Yarn

Subsequently, due to the selling off by bulls, it eased to 5,990 yuan, and then spot prices rose with it, closing at 6,080 yuan. However, trading outside the market had already reached 6,160 yuan.

### Leading Fine Cloth Breaks New Record at 305 Yuan; Many in the Trade Take Advantage of High Prices to Sell

Yesterday's cloth market saw cotton yarn prices continuing to rise and the price of Dong Pi increasing dramatically. Although sales of cloth produced by local factories were nonexistent, asking prices rose accordingly. Sixteen-pound Diqiu coarse cloth was priced at 267 yuan, Feihong at 257 yuan, eight-pound Zhenzhong at 140 yuan, twelve-pound Dapeng fine cloth at 255 yuan, Diqiu at 237 yuan, Fugui at 137 yuan, Fugui fine twill at 120 yuan, and Taohua Ladies' Lin started at 358 yuan and rose to 361 yuan. However, poplin remained mediocre, Changshou was at 7.75 yuan and Sanyang new stripes at 7.6 yuan, with very few transactions. The price of Shu Bu rose wildly and endlessly. The new order for twelve-pound Longtou fine cloth opened this morning at 298 yuan, rising in a straight line to a new record high of 305 yuan, closing at 303.5 yuan at noon. The red order for Si Junzi Serge opened at 9.90 yuan, reaching a high of 10.018 yuan, closing at 10.014 yuan at noon. Observing the market trading, the yarn flower merchants made the largest number of transactions, while the trade and foreign firms, realizing that prices had reached their peak and that appetite was dull, were raising prices and selling off, which was not uncommon.

### Public Bond Fluctuations: The Largest Difference Between High and Low Prices for Type A Bonds

Yesterday's unofficial market for public bonds saw more short covering due to it being a Saturday. Initially, there were over 300,000 bonds from the previous day still for sale, causing prices to drop again. Type A bonds even fell below the 60-yuan mark. Other types followed suit, showing a grim picture. Suddenly, selling stopped, triggering short squeezes and increased buying, sending prices soaring. Type A bonds experienced the largest price difference, a staggering 3.80 yuan. The wild swings, with some bonds turning from losses to gains, demonstrated the immense volatility. Those making a living in this market face perilous conditions, enough to chill one to the bone. Yesterday's initial sales totaled only a little over 300,000, mainly absorbed by firms like Lianhe, Dakangcheng, and Lianyi. The rest were taken up by Yongkang, Yuanhe, Qianyi, Dechang, and Hengyu. Most of the supply came from Jiufeng, Hu Heji, Zhenhua, and Xiekang, as one side covered shorts while the other took the opportunity to raise prices, leading to the large drops and gains. However, this did not necessarily reflect the true trend. As a result, prices rose by 0.50 to 1.60 yuan, except for construction bonds which fell slightly by 0.40 yuan, and Type C bonds which remained unchanged. The total trading volume was approximately 880,000 yuan. A simplified table is listed below:

### Chinese Stocks Particularly Lively

### Spot "Haxia" Futures Market Turns Upward Again

The unofficial market for spot "Haxia" futures has turned strong. After a sell-off of 21,000 yuan, Tianjin brokers bought in small quantities, pushing up the price. The market opened 350 yuan higher at 21,100 yuan. Securities firms (Tianjin brokers) sold off small amounts, pushing it back down to 21,050 yuan. Money shops and gold shops jointly moved in to buy, while two other securities firms also absorbed supply. This caused the price to rise by 150 yuan. The final transaction price was 21,200 yuan, a sharp increase of 450 yuan compared to the previous day. Buyers were still present at the closing price, but there were no sellers. Fluctuations of 150 yuan occurred throughout the day, with trading volume being moderate.

Gold shops have raised the price of gold jewelry by 50 yuan per tael, to 2,200 yuan (buying price reduced by 200 yuan). Standard silver was at 18 yuan. Black market silver was at 15.78 yuan. Silver coins were at 9.50 yuan each. These showed little change.

### Discount Rates for Drafts and Bills Continue to Rise

In the foreign exchange market, both the British gold pound and the US dollar rose by 10 yuan. The former was at 510 yuan, and the latter was at 520 yuan. US dollar notes were around 33 yuan. Hong Kong dollars rose slightly to 4.89 yuan. Military scrip opened at 7.42 yuan, then retreated to 7.38 yuan, before rising again to 7.44 yuan, finally settling at 7.42 yuan, an increase of 0.02 yuan compared to the previous day. The discount rate for drafts and bills increased again, with a net gain of 35 yuan per 1,000 yuan for full discounting, with an offering rate of 30 yuan, a difference of 7 yuan. The interest rate for interbank lending rose by 0.01 yuan to 0.15 yuan. The premium for reserve notes reached a maximum of 0.37 yuan per yuan, then settled at 0.35 yuan. Cash was at 0.313 yuan.

### 300,000 Bags of Sugar in Storage

Yesterday's sugar market remained firm. Based on the military scrip exchange rate of 7.40 yuan, the price for coarse white and special white sugar should be around 525 yuan, and 503-504 yuan for Dutch red sugar. Sugar stocks also rose by 4-5 yuan yesterday. From February to this month, over 220,000 bags of sugar have been sold. Therefore, the cooperative stores have less than 300,000 bags in storage.

### Hoarding of Matches and Soap Resurfaces

The rising trend in the selling price of daily necessities such as soap and matches has reignited, with extreme optimism among the public. Recently, local retailers have been eager to stock up, leading to increased hoarding. This is because the raw materials for factories, such as soap materials and coconut oil, have become problematic, so prices have risen more than they have fallen. Phoenix brand matches were priced at 6,200 yuan per case, Beauty brand at 6,100 yuan, and Golden Tripod brand at 5,400 yuan, a sharp increase of 600 to 800 yuan compared to the previous day. Soap prices continued to soar, with the top price for Guben soap reaching 410 yuan per case, Baixiangmao soap at 350 yuan, Huangxiangmao soap at 330 yuan, and Arrow soap at 240 yuan, all rising by 20-30 yuan each. The candle market was stable, with Price's still at 190 yuan and Monk's Hat brand at 175 yuan, with little demand.

### Creating Outstanding Children

— Yi

To create an outstanding child, considerable education is needed. Maternal education is the most precious in the world, but often some talented children are overlooked by their parents.

According to the results of actual tests conducted by Professor Terman of Stanford University in California, many exceptionally intelligent children are particularly interested in arithmetic, chemistry, drawing, and nature, and this can be observed at a very early age. One five-year-old child told his father, "Dad, look how strange the number 2520 is, it can be evenly divided by 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10."

Children with relatively good natural talent speak earlier. You can know what new knowledge he has learned from every ten new words he speaks. After he enters school, he often knows the meaning of the book without much reading, and it is not uncommon for a seven-year-old child to do the work of a ten-year-old child.

If you find that your child has exceptional qualities, you must not publicize it for him, nor should you put heavy schoolwork on his shoulders, but you should let him develop a proper pastime. When Darwin was studying at school, the teacher said he was stupid, but he collected many currencies, plants, shells, and stones, and studied their names. This is a manifestation of his research instinct.

A Nobel Prize winner, Arthur Compton, wrote an article in his childhood opposing the general statement of why some elephants have five toes and some have three. That article was very ridiculous, but his mother did not laugh at him, but discussed it with him carefully. Later, he said that if his mother had laughed at him, then he would no longer have the interest in research.

You can pay attention to your child, does he often have novel thoughts? Does he want to surpass others? Does he become more determined when he encounters difficulties? Does he continue to work hard until the problem is solved? If you can have a positive answer, then your child is a talented child, and this discovery will definitely make you very happy.

Who says that raising children is a boring job? In fact, there are many interesting facts waiting for you to discover.

### My Mother (Announcement of the Fourth Essay)

— Chen Hua

The parents and children in this article love each other, and their family affection is deep. It can truly be called a "model family", which is enviable. May all families in the world be like this. — Editor. My mother, Yao, was born in 1881. She married my father when she was eighteen years old. Then she gave birth to ten children in a row. It was very coincidental that our group was composed like this: after the eldest brother, the second brother, the third brother, and the fourth brother, the eldest sister was born; after the fifth brother, the sixth brother, me, and the eighth brother, the youngest sister was born. Our ages, except for the youngest sister, who was born a little later, are mostly two years apart. Eight sons and two daughters, divided into two groups, so harmonious, so symmetrical, like a masterpiece of God. I remember when I was a child, my mother often said: My family is like a crab, with four pairs of legs and a pair of pincers, which just represent our eight brothers and two sisters. My mother also said: She has ten children, just like ten fingers growing on a pair of hands. Each child has a heart, and she loves everyone.

My family was originally a family of scholars for generations, with no property to speak of. My father served his hometown for more than thirty years, and he usually had no savings. He only hoped that his children could enjoy a good education. This is the property he distributed to us. At one point, several brothers and sisters were studying in universities, middle schools, and elementary schools at the same time; therefore, tuition became the biggest expense in my family. My mother often ate vegetarian food and recited scriptures, and she lived the most frugally; however, she believed that the education of her children was related to lifelong achievements, and she attached great importance to it. She would rather save on food and clothing, and usually save a little bit at a time, to provide for our brothers to go to school. Moreover, my father was often outside because of his busy schedule and the struggle of life, and he could not always pay attention to our studies. My mother assumed the responsibility of raising her children, and often gave us a lot of encouragement and precepts. For example, when we were studying in elementary and middle schools in this city, we had to say goodbye to our mother every day when we went to school. My mother always exhorted us: "Study hard and get the top grade—walk with good character!" She shouted like this, sent us out of the house, stood at the door and watched, until she could no longer hear our footsteps. This impression is deeply engraved in my mind and will never be forgotten. Therefore, among our brothers and sisters, as long as we have a firm belief in studying, we can all have the opportunity to enjoy higher education. Moreover, although none of us brothers dare to say that we have any achievements; however, in general, we dare to say that we have not disappointed our parents too much!

In the summer of the fifteenth year of the Republic of China, my sixth brother died of illness, which was the greatest misfortune in my family; it was like a complete crab, missing a leg. At that time, my mother cried really sadly, it was more painful than cutting off one of her fingers. After that, thanks to the blessing of the Creator, my parents and brothers and sisters are all healthy! Now, all of us have become "adults". The eldest brother is already forty-one years old, the eighth brother is twenty-eight years old, and the youngest sister is also ten years old. Before the war, there were relatively more opportunities to meet each other; but in recent years, except for the eldest brother and three sisters who stayed in Shanghai to serve their parents, the rest of the brothers are scattered in the Great Rear Area.

The author said goodbye to his parents and went to Fujian to work. Four years have passed in a flash. The thoughts of relatives are getting deeper with time. On the sixth day of the tenth lunar month last year, it was my mother's sixtieth birthday. I had already planned to return home at that time, but it did not materialize, and I felt very worried. This year, on the sixteenth day of the lunar month, it will be my father's sixtieth birthday. It is naturally a rare event in life for parents to celebrate their sixtieth birthdays together. Moreover, among the six brothers who are abroad, my service location is the closest to my hometown; therefore, I ignored all the dangers and decided to ask for leave to return home to visit my relatives and celebrate their birthdays, which lasted for ten days and traveled thousands of miles. Thanks to the blessing of God, I arrived in Shanghai safely on the evening of March 16th, and met my parents whom I had not seen for more than four years, and congratulated them: "May you live to be a hundred years old! The older you get, the healthier you become!"

Every human being in the world has a mother, and has received the love of a loving mother. We believe that among all kinds of "love" in the world, the love of a loving mother is the most sacred, the purest, and the greatest! If everyone can give full play to this noble "motherly love", then every family will become an ideal family, every country will become an ideal country, and the whole world will surely become an ideal world! The author is proud to have a great mother. Therefore, I would like to give a simple introduction to the general situation of my family. Because my mother often said: "I have devoted half my life to raising my children; I only hope that all my children can become "complete people", this is the result of my efforts!"

### One Week's Home-Style Menu

— Ms. Hua Ying

Pork is still more than nine yuan per catty, so my family hasn't tasted meat for many days. In fact, the expensive items on the market are not just pork. Many things are frighteningly expensive. The cheapest among the vegetables is yellow croaker, which costs only about 0.15 yuan per catty in the city market. So, our dining table almost always meets yellow croaker. The easiest and most economical way to make yellow croaker is to stew it with preserved vegetables. Braising, frying, poaching, or vinegar sauce will cost more oil, sugar, and vinegar. As for making yellow croaker noodles, the taste is indeed good, but it is not easy to eat after deboning, and amaranth is just on the market and the price is too expensive, so it is better to wait until the season. Monday: Minced pork with tofu, yellow croaker stewed with preserved vegetables, braised cabbage, and celery with sesame sauce. Tuesday: Beef with soybeans, dried shrimps with steamed eggs, broad beans, lettuce leaves, and scallion oil radish shreds. Wednesday: Bean curd sheets with meat soup, yellow croaker slices with vinegar sauce, fried dough sticks with green vegetables, and Beijing pickled cabbage with bean noodles. Thursday: Pork shreds with pickled mustard tubers, steamed fish soup, stir-fried new spinach, and broad bean salad with preserved vegetables. Friday: Beef with vermicelli, braised large yellow croaker, stir-fried cauliflower, and soy bean sprouts with preserved vegetables. Saturday: Chicken slices with broad beans, snow pea sprouts with diced shrimp, braised vegetarian delicacy, and bamboo shoots with lettuce. Sunday: Stir-fried duck giblets, steamed fish, stir-fried shepherd's purse, and stir-fried broad beans.

Dear Editor: Marriage is the biggest problem in life, and it is also very related to lifelong happiness; however, young people generally cannot get freedom of marriage, and I am now one who is in this position.

I have a girlfriend. She is my neighbor, so we see each other morning and evening; because she has good learning and good character, love gradually grew between us, and it has been more than a year now. She often urges me to study hard and save money, so that I can move forward and become a person who is beneficial to society; she is also very willing to marry me, but unfortunately, she was born in an old-fashioned family, and now, according to the opinion of her grandfather, she is going to be engaged to a man she has never met. Although she is very unwilling, because of the oppression of the old etiquette, she cannot resist, and she has to sacrifice the happiness of our whole lives. As for me, I am just a graduating student. I cannot help her escape this unfortunate environment, so that we can enjoy the happiness of sacred love forever; and get the freedom of marriage.

Now I would like Mr. to show us a bright path, which can protect the happiness of our future; at the same time, it can also relieve the pain of young people in the world who are in the same position. Wishing you well.

Curie

Curie: Your lover is going to be engaged to a man she has never met under the oppression of the old etiquette, which is naturally a major blow to you. As usual, I can tell you that resistance is the best way, but it also seems that the facts should be taken into account. In your letter, it is not mentioned whether you are about to graduate from university or from secondary school. For a young man who is in school, is it worth sacrificing a bright future for the sake of love? You should think about it. To resist, you must first estimate the strength of both of you (naturally I do not hope you will succumb). I think you should consider the following questions:

Can you negotiate with her grandfather to stop the engagement procedure?

Do you have sufficient strength to prepare to resist? Does the other party have the strength to prepare? Is it a better way to painfully sacrifice your lover and work hard to make progress in your studies?
