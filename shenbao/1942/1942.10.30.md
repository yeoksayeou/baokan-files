Rome, 28th (Allied News Agency) – The Italian Military Headquarters announced in a war bulletin on the 28th that fierce fighting between enemy and our forces continued throughout the day on the Egyptian front. The fighting was most intense in the north, with key positions remaining in the hands of the Axis forces. On the 27th, 53 enemy armored vehicles were destroyed or captured. In aerial combat, 21 British aircraft were shot down.

Berlin, 29th (Haitong News Agency) – Authoritative sources here declared today that after repelling enemy offensives at various points on the Egyptian front, the German-Italian forces launched a powerful offensive against British tank brigades at dawn yesterday. Axis aircraft squadrons participated in the battle.

Bern, Switzerland, 28th (Havas News Agency) – According to sources in Berlin, today marks the fifth day of the British offensive on the Egyptian front. The most noteworthy aspect of the fighting on the front is the fierce battle taking place in the north, while in the central and southern sectors, both sides are preparing for a major battle. The Axis forces have been able to hold their ground in all areas and have forced the British to retreat in several locations. It is reported that at dawn today, a unit of German-Italian forces attacked a British armored column, and despite resolute enemy resistance, they ultimately defeated the British, forcing them to abandon their positions. According to sources in Rome, Italian newspapers are limited to publishing official Italian war bulletins, but use large headlines to indicate the importance of the matter. According to neutral sources in Rome, the North African campaign is developing, clearly in favor of the Axis powers. The British side also acknowledges the brave fighting of the German-Italian forces and the extreme strength of the positions they hold. According to reports from Cairo, the North African campaign is expected to be protracted, and no significant results are expected in the short term.

Berlin, 29th (Haitong News Agency) – Authoritative sources reported last night that after several days of fierce fighting, the German-Italian defense line from the Qattara Depression to the Mediterranean coast has remained unshaken. Since Tuesday, British forces have concentrated their efforts on attacking the northern flank of the Alamein line. Lieutenant General Montgomery, commander of the British Eighth Army, has not only mobilized the British 44th Division, the Scottish 51st Division, and the 15th Tank Division, but has also transferred the 9th Tank Division from Palestine in order to launch a five-pronged attack on the German-Italian defense line. Four of these prongs have been easily repelled by German-Italian forces. The main battle is currently taking place 12 kilometers southeast of Rahman, where the enemy forces are more numerous and disregard the heavy sacrifices in manpower and material, thus achieving a local victory, occupying a mountain suitable for artillery observation. However, after a counteroffensive by German-Italian forces in the evening, the enemy forces had to abandon the mountain. The enemy lost 53 tanks on the northern side of this line. Thus, the enemy has lost over 300 tanks in the past few days. At the beginning of the offensive, the enemy possessed a thousand tanks, and has now lost one-third of them, yet has not even come into contact with German-Italian tanks. The German air squadrons played a significant role in repelling the enemy's offensive on Tuesday. German heavy bombers continuously bombed enemy concentration points and tank columns, causing numerous fires. One ammunition depot was hit and caught fire. The British forces suffered unusually heavy losses across the entire line, and the British ambulance teams are working day and night but are still insufficient. German-Italian fighter planes are also very active, engaging in repeated fierce battles with British aircraft, shooting down 20 British and American planes. Another enemy aircraft was shot down by German anti-aircraft batteries. On the fifth day of the British offensive, there was fierce fighting on the northern sector of the Egyptian front, while the central and southern sectors were relatively quiet.

### German Aircraft and Heavy Artillery Bomb Stalingrad's Central District Fiercely, Soviet Troops Cross Volga River for Reinforcements, Fierce Fighting Northeast of Tuapse

Stockholm, Sweden, 29th (Havas News Agency) – After German forces in Stalingrad cleared out the remaining enemy troops near the October Revolution Factory, they again used heavy artillery and aircraft to bomb the city center and the train station between the industrial districts. According to reports from Berlin, the fortifications in this station area are as strong as the October Revolution Factory. If they are not bombed first, infantry offensives, even if launched with great force, may fail. According to the Swedish News Agency in Berlin, the defending troops there are receiving a continuous stream of reinforcements from across the Volga River. The number of Red Army reserves seems inexhaustible, and German aircraft and artillery bombardment cannot stop them. As for the German forces, the Soviet side believes that there are still 15 infantry divisions, 3 motorized divisions, and 4 mechanized divisions inside and outside the city.

Stockholm, Sweden, 28th (Havas News Agency) – According to the latest news from the Eastern Front, the two armies are still engaged in fierce fighting in the southern suburbs of Stalingrad, between Krasnoarmeysk and Beketovka. The Red Army is less than two kilometers from the bank of the Volga River. Their objective is to occupy a high ground in order to expand their area of operations. However, the German defenses are also very strong, so the Red Army has not made any progress so far. In the northern suburbs of Stalingrad, the Red Army twice launched fierce attacks on the German left flank near the Don River. It seems they met with determined resistance and had to retreat to their original positions. As for the battle situation in the area of Tuapse in the western Caucasus, there have been no major changes. The main German forces are fighting in the high mountains, about fifteen kilometers away from the port. The German-Italian forces continue to advance in the Terek River basin.

Moscow, 28th (Havas News Agency) – The General Staff announced that the Red Army in the Stalingrad area yesterday fought outnumbered, repelling a fierce German offensive. German forces continued to make progress on certain streets in the city. German forces attempted unsuccessfully to retake a village northwest of the city. In addition, the Red Army is engaged in fierce fighting northeast of Tuapse. There have been no major changes on other fronts.

Berlin, 28th (Allied News Agency) – After the remaining Soviet troops in the northwest corner of Stalingrad emerged from the Bread Factory, they continued to resist stubbornly. The German army also made every effort to attack, eliminate Soviet resistance, and advance step by step. The German infantry and engineering units that completed the mopping-up operation in the northern part of the Bread Factory also broke through the Soviet-held house positions and advanced further on the 27th to the banks of the Volga River. They then turned south and occupied a Soviet fuel and ammunition depot. German air force bomber squadrons echoed this at this time, bombarding Soviet artillery positions and inflicting heavy damage. Now that the German army has reached the banks of the Volga River, the Soviet supply line on the river has been completely cut off by the German army.

Snowstorms in the Caucasus, Germans Occupy Nalchik

Rome, 28th (Havas News Agency) – According to Italian newspapers, the weather in the Caucasus region has improved, and German forces have continued to advance, having already occupied the city of Nalchik. The city's location is important, and in the future, German forces can use a small number of troops to defend a wide front during the winter, as all the mountain passes in the area are now in German hands. It is estimated that German forces may not continue to advance south. According to a war correspondent for the Italian Giornale d'Italia, high mountains stand south of Nalchik, and with late autumn approaching, winter will soon arrive, so German forces are unlikely to advance further. However, on the Grozny line, German forces are now advancing to the southeast.

Berlin, 29th (Haitong News Agency) – German forces and their allies are making good progress in their operations in the Caucasus. A great victory is about to be completed on the Terek front. Romanian forces are now approaching a key town there. The Romanian operations have been greatly aided by German tanks. In the fighting in the Tuapse area on the Black Sea coast, German forces are now fighting for important mountain ridges there, and several ridges have already fallen into German hands. The fighting in the central Caucasus has been greatly affected by the adverse weather conditions. Although it has been snowing heavily, fierce fighting is still taking place. On the Stalingrad front, German and allied forces are still attacking enemy strongholds, with aircraft support. The Soviet positions on the east bank of the Volga River have also been bombed, and the Soviet rear lines of communication have also been targeted by aircraft bombing. Soviet troops are now putting up fierce resistance on the railway line south of the October Revolution Factory, so German forces have dispatched aircraft to bombard them heavily.

Gandhi will be approached regarding this matter.

Lisbon, 29th (Domei News Agency) - According to a report from Quetta, a bomb exploded in front of the residence of the newly appointed governor of Sindh Province on the evening of the 27th. There were no casualties. Police are now heavily guarding the residence. A bomb was also found in the yard of a cabinet minister's residence.

Bangkok, 29th (Haitong News Agency) - A dispatch from New Delhi last night stated that Bombay has continued to experience bomb incidents in the last 24 hours. A bomb exploded near the cotton exchange, injuring three policemen and one civilian. More than 40 people were arrested. A bomb also exploded inside the Supreme Court a few days ago. Another bomb was discovered in time and did not explode. Two Indians in Bombay were sentenced to six months imprisonment for participating in an anti-British demonstration. The situation in other parts of Bombay Province is also extremely chaotic, with demonstrations, clashes, and arrests continuing to occur.

### Soviet Aircraft Raid Finnish Capital

### Homes of Indigenous People in French West Africa

The region of Timbuktu in French West Africa is arid year-round, with little rainfall. The landscape features cliffs, steep mountains, and caves, forming a perilous terrain. Being there evokes a sense of reaching the end of the world. To avoid the intense sun, the indigenous people erect short stone pillars and cover them with firewood to build shelters. In the picture, the elderly of the tribe dwell in these structures. The common people reside in caves and open areas on the slopes to protect themselves from enemies, where they have lived, clothed, and fed themselves for many years.

### Limited Use of Taxis Planned: Municipal Authorities Studying Management Policies; Hope for Resumption of Business Next Week

Representatives from the Shanghai Municipal Council, the French Municipal Council, and the City Government met earlier this week to decide on management policies for taxis that will be allowed to operate from the beginning of next month. Details of the meeting are not known, but it is said that the authorities are currently studying the meeting report, with the aim of reaching a unified approach.

Still Requires the Use of Alternative Fuels

It is reported that the three municipal authorities, including the Shanghai Municipal Council, have received many applications from taxi companies and are currently studying them. The names of the taxi companies that will be allowed to operate are expected to be announced in a few days. The three municipal authorities are carefully considering all matters related to the resumption of taxi services in the city. It is expected that the aim will be to limit the number of taxis to the lowest reasonable number. At the same time, fares and notifications will still be controlled by the municipal authorities. According to an official announcement earlier this month, only vehicles using alternative fuels are allowed to operate after applying to the Garrison Headquarters by October 21st. The permits that will be issued will also be subject to restrictions.

Permitted Number Likely Several Hundred

It is estimated that the number of vehicles allowed to operate will be around 157, with an average of about 50 in each district. Taxis may receive a single license that will allow them to operate in all three districts. Taxi companies must obtain this license from the municipal authority in the district where their office is located. Although the exact date for the resumption of taxi services has not been announced, reliable sources say that the resumption is expected next week.

### Through Traffic from Jiangwan to the French Concession to be Enabled

A report from the Domei News Agency in Shanghai states that the Japanese-language Shanghai Mainichi Shimbun reported yesterday that the Huazhong Metropolitan Bus Company has reached an agreement with the Japanese authorities to start a bus service between Shanghai Shrine in Jiangwan and Szechuan Road on Avenue Edward VII on November 3rd. The company found that the transport convenience in these areas was insufficient, causing considerable inconvenience to the public. Therefore, since September, it has been preparing to open a bus route to connect Jiangwan Road and Szechuan Road. More than 28 buses will operate on this route. The buses will start from Shanghai Shrine, travel along Dixwell Road and Woosung Road, turn into North Szechuan Road, and travel directly to the terminus on Avenue Edward VII. The fare will be 20 sen in Japanese currency, regardless of distance.

### Crackdown on Black Market Sugar Sales: Supervision of Retail Transactions; Suspension of Rationing for Profiteering; Heavy Penalties for Hoarding on the Black Market

Recently, the amount of sugar sold at the door of various sugar retail stores in the city has been greatly reduced, with each person even limited to buying five jiao, or simply completely suspended. Residents feel greatly inconvenienced. The Sugar Merchants' Cooperative, considering that the monthly allocation is actually sufficient to meet the city's needs, and yet now there is a shortage, has determined that someone must be causing trouble. After several investigations, it was discovered that there are two reasons:

Sugar Industry Giants Hoarding

(1) Candy stores that manufacture sweets are transforming the sugar they receive, altering its form, and smuggling it for external sales. Other retail sugar stores are even selling their sugar to candy stores, resulting in black market prices, and the sugar on the market is becoming scarce. (2) Large numbers of rural farmers come to Shanghai and buy sugar at high prices, and then sell it to the surrounding villages. Retail sugar stores can sell more if they give black market prices. After learning the details, the Sugar Business Office convened a meeting to discuss countermeasures. It has now been decided that the amount of sugar allocated by the office each month will remain at 20,000 bags. Wholesale sugar companies will pick up the goods with certificates, and retail stores will purchase the required amount from the sugar companies each month. If the amount exceeds 30 bags, the cooperative will send someone to supervise the sale at each store. The daily sales limit will be one-thirtieth of the total amount. In other words, the sugar obtained by retail stores will be sold evenly every day. Those who receive 30 bags will be limited to selling one bag per day, and those who receive 60 bags will be limited to selling two bags per day. For sugar stores with a monthly allocation of less than 30 bags, all transactions must be recorded in accounts, which will be reviewed by the Sugar Merchants' Cooperative at any time.

Revocation of Registration for Repeated Violations

If any profiteering behavior is discovered, the registration and allocation qualifications will be canceled, and supply will be cut off in the future. There are more than 1,000 registered retail sugar stores, divided into two categories: A and B. Category A specializes in direct door-to-door sales, and Category B includes candy stores, etc. In the future, regardless of whether they are Category A or B, if there are any more black market profiteering behaviors, the sugar stores involved will be permanently suspended from allocation. It has been found that there are currently 300,000 bags of sugar in Shanghai, and another 300,000 bags in Hong Kong, which is enough to meet the needs for two years. These sugar industry giants are hoarding the market price, which is extremely outrageous.

### Are Second Landlords Licensed? Investigations Conducted Separately

According to news from the License Issuing Office for Subletting Houses of the Shanghai Municipal Council, as a result of public officials conducting separate on-site investigations, approximately 20 second landlords in the International Settlement go to obtain licenses every day. It is said that many only go to obtain licenses after being inspected by investigators. It is said that if a second landlord refuses to obtain a license, after being informed by the investigators sent by the Shanghai Municipal Council, they must be ordered to go to apply for one and pay a late fee of 15 yuan. If the second landlord still deliberately delays and the time exceeds three days, the Shanghai Municipal Council will initiate a lawsuit according to law.

### Grain Rationing Resumes in the Putuo District's Shantytowns

The Putuo District is densely populated, so there are many residents living in shantytowns. These people usually work in factories during the day and live in thatched sheds at night. Their lives are extremely difficult. Last month, the authorities stopped their purchase of household rice because the shantytown residents had never paid municipal donations according to regulations. These people usually rely on odd jobs to make a living. Once they are restricted in this way, they will have no food and will simply starve to death. The Putuo District Baojia Association authorities, in view of this, have repeatedly applied to the Shanghai Municipal Council's Grain Management Committee to restore their rice rations. It is now learned that the shantytown household rice tickets have been approved and issued by the authorities. The total number is 2,479 people. However, the issuance of this rice ticket is later than usual. Those who start buying rice on the first day often only receive it on the eighth or ninth day. After the shantytowns receive it, the deadline is only one or two days away. Shantytown residents often suffer from a lack of money in their hands for a while. Because the time is short, they often watch their rice tickets expire and become invalid. Recently, the Baojia Association in the district has made representations to the Grain Management Authorities to apply for the earliest possible issuance.

### Deadline for Group Registration Extended to the End of Next Month: Premises to be Sealed if Overdue

The Shanghai Municipal Council issued a notice on the 19th of this month, announcing that all associations, groups, trade unions, and general associations (excluding state agencies) in the International Settlement must register and obtain licenses at Office No. 607, Fuzhou Road Police Station, during this month. It is now learned that the council has issued another notice, extending the registration deadline to November 30th. Those who fail to register after the deadline will have their premises sealed and will be dealt with separately.

### Authorities Discuss Baojia Fundraising Plan Again: Foreign Self-Defense Corps Levies "Income Tax" of Approximately 1-1.5% of Income from Immigrants

According to the English-language Shanghai Times, Mr. Cateaux, head of the Beihama Foreign Baojia Self-Defense Corps, recently told reporters that the Foreign Self-Defense Corps has submitted a plan to the Shanghai Municipal Council to collect funds from immigrants to be used by the Self-Defense Corps.

Foreign Levy Awaiting Approval

It is still awaiting approval. The tax levied is approximately 1-1.5% of each immigrant's income. This money will be used not only to purchase equipment for the Self-Defense Corps, but also to maintain two canteens to relieve poor immigrants who cannot support themselves. Therefore, the Foreign Self-Defense Corps is currently preparing to distribute forms to all immigrants to fill out their income and other items in order to levy "income tax."

Chinese Baojia Fundraising Campaign

According to reliable sources, the Chinese Baojia Self-Defense Corps will launch a fundraising campaign in the near future, with the aim of obtaining sufficient funds to meet the needs of this large organization. The fundraising plan is being drafted. At that time, slogans will be posted, radio stations will broadcast special Baojia programs, and theaters will perform Baojia dramas, so that citizens will be familiar with the good work being done by the Baojia Self-Defense Corps.

Youth Self-Defense Corps Set at 1,000 Members

The organization of the Youth Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council Self-Defense Corps has been in preparation for more than two months. The various tasks are progressing smoothly. The number of Youth Department members is tentatively set at 1,000, and they are recommended by the Lianbao Chiefs, etc. However, those who voluntarily participate are also welcome. Many people have signed up to participate, exceeding 600. The Baojia authorities are currently reviewing them separately. The inaugural meeting was originally scheduled to be held in the middle of next month, but due to the complexity of the work and insufficient preparation, it has been decided to be held in early December.

### Rules on Absence from Duty and Fines for Police and Civilians in the Xuhui District

It is now learned that the Xuhui District Baojia Committee issued Notice No. 1 yesterday afternoon as follows: "Notice: (1) The duty tasks of the civilian police corps members are important and responsible, and they should observe the time and not evade or ask someone to replace them for any reason. Except in cases of special circumstances, a written report should be made to the Lianbao Chief, which will be investigated and verified before approval. Those who violate this rule shall be punished according to the following regulations: Absence from duty within 5 minutes, after three times, will be punished with one duty. Absence from duty for more than 5 minutes will be punished with one duty each time. Absence from duty for more than 15 minutes will be punished with two duties each time. (2) The armbands issued by the police station to each Baojia member should be properly preserved. Once lost, they should be punished according to the following regulations: Lianbao Chiefs who lose their armbands will be fined 100 yuan. Baojia Chiefs who lose their armbands will be fined 50 yuan. Civilian police corps members who lose their armbands will be fined 20 yuan and must publish a statement in the newspaper before applying to the police station for a replacement. (3) When residents are asked to check their household registration, they should recognize whether the Baojia Chief is in charge of their household. If so, they should ask them to show their Baojia personnel ID to see if it is legitimate, because the jurisdiction of Baojia personnel can only be enforced within their Baojia. The above three items should be observed and not violated. This notice."

### Jiangsu Bank Shanghai Branch Urges Customers to Collect the First Installment of Payable Deposits: Until November 20th

After the Shanghai branches of the three banks of Zhejiang, Jiangsu, and Jiangxi Yumin were ordered to cease operations and liquidate, the custodian approved the return of deposits. It is reported that Jiangsu Bank announced yesterday that "This branch is operating in accordance with the instructions of the Japanese authorities to carry out liquidation. Since October 5th, it has started to return fixed and current deposits. It has been found that a large number of depositors have delayed in coming to collect the first installment of payable deposits. We hope that all depositors will pay attention and come to collect them quickly before November 20th. Those who do not come to pay after the deadline will be deemed to have waived their right to payment. Please do not delay yourselves. This announcement."

### Interbank Deposits Completely Resolved: Bank of Communications Resumes Operations and Continues Transactions; Deposits in HSBC and Other Banks are Returned

Regarding the interbank deposits of various commercial banks, remittance firms, and qianzhuang in the Central Bank, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and foreign banks such as HSBC, Mercantile, and Citibank under the Joint Bank Reserve Council and the Money Industry Reserve, all of the above banks were ordered to cease operations after December 8th last year, causing the interbank deposits of various banks to be temporarily frozen. It has now been learned from the banking and money industries that the authorities and various banks have contacted Anfu and have reached a satisfactory solution: (1) The Bank of China and the Bank of Communications have officially resumed operations, and interbank deposits are allowed to continue transactions. Interest will be paid at 3% as before. (2) The Central Bank has been liquidated, and interbank deposits have been returned separately. (3) Interbank deposits in foreign banks such as HSBC, Mercantile, and Citibank have been approved and returned separately by the custodian. Since the problem of interbank deposits in various banks has been resolved, the interbank deposits of various interbank remittance firms and qianzhuang that were previously frozen have been completely unfrozen, thereby strengthening their own foundation and helping to promote financial stability and the development of legitimate industry and commerce.

### 16th Ration: Rice and Flour Allocation

The Shanghai Municipal Council recently issued Notice No. 6147, explaining that Coupon No. 15 of the Rice Purchase Certificate, which is used to purchase rice and flour, is only valid until March 30th and will be invalid after the deadline. During the period from November 1st to November 9th, the rice shops and rice sales offices of the council will only sell rice with Coupon No. 16. At that time, the rice shops with the registered number noted on the coupon will sell half a sheng of white rice and one sheng of broken rice per coupon, with a total price of 3 yuan and 8 jiao. The holder of the coupon may freely purchase one and a half jin of flour, with a price of 3 yuan and 4 jiao. The rice shops and rice sales offices of the council will stop selling rice for one day on November 10th.

### $70 Million Loan Rollover for End-of-Year Credit

Various banks, money houses, and firms have already liaised with their industrial and commercial clients regarding the long-term credit loan rollover from the end of the tenth month, and the procedures have been completed as scheduled. If there is indeed a legitimate need, a rollover to the end of the fourth month of next year is permitted. However, the loan interest to be collected should be settled clearly in accordance with the seven yuan rate decided by the internal meeting. According to a Central News Agency reporter's inquiry with the Money Industry Association, the loan agreement for this year's end-of-tenth-month accommodation rollover has also been signed and established. The total amount of loan rollovers by various banks and firms is approximately 70 million yuan, mostly involving existing clients. Regarding new credit loans in the future, if the credit is indeed reliable, there is a legitimate need, or the loan is for developing productive industries and is secured by a guarantee, loans will be granted as much as possible.

### Winter Disease Prevention Campaign to Begin Soon, Focusing on Clearing Street Filth and Expanding Prohibition of Spitting

Mr. Tashiro, the director of the Public Works Department's Hygiene Bureau, stated that diseases such as typhoid fever, smallpox, influenza, dysentery, and bronchitis are most rampant every winter. In order to prevent the spread of these diseases, the Hygiene Bureau is currently drafting a plan for a winter disease prevention campaign.

Concentrating Efforts to Ensure Cleanliness

This campaign will begin in a few days, and it is also announced that epidemic prevention certificates are no longer needed, as tiger plague is most prevalent in the summer and has now stopped spreading, no longer posing a serious threat to public health. Most diseases in Shanghai are caused by uncleanliness in roads, neighborhoods, and streets. Therefore, when launching the campaign to reduce the mortality rate of citizens this winter, we will focus our attention on clearing uncleanliness from the streets of the Public Concession. Restaurant kitchens and public toilets will be inspected regularly to ensure their cleanliness.

Preventing the Spread of Infectious Diseases

Many harmful diseases spread due to a lack of hygiene. If the origins of infectious diseases are eliminated, Shanghai can be in an ideal state of hygiene this winter. The Public Works Department has decided to build permanent public toilets on the Bund to replace the current temporary ones, demonstrating the authorities' efforts to prevent the spread of winter infectious diseases. Spitting in the streets and public places is harmful to public health. Therefore, the Hygiene Bureau plans to promote a prohibition of spitting campaign to make the public aware of the dangers of spitting everywhere, so that the fundamental origins of the spread of lung disease can be eliminated. This campaign may begin in a very short time. In short, the winter hygiene situation in Shanghai will be under satisfactory control, and there are various reasons to be optimistic.

### Catholic Old People's Home One-Week Fundraising

Organized by St. Francis School

The Shanghai Old People's Home was founded by Catholic nuns and has a history of 38 years since its establishment. It is located at No. 38 Jichang Street, Pudong. Currently, it accommodates 350 men and women aged 60 and above, regardless of whether they are Catholics or not, all are cared for equally. Recently, due to the high cost of goods, the need for funds has greatly increased. St. Francis School specially printed a small notice the day before yesterday, sending it to the families of students and their relatives, for a one-week fundraising campaign. Regardless of the amount of money or goods (food and clothing are acceptable), generous donations will be collected and forwarded on their behalf, which can be said to be a pioneer in the education sector's enthusiasm for the elderly care cause. It is heard that the home hopes that charitable people will visit and provide assistance.

### A Couple Commits Suicide Due to Economic Hardship

At around 9:37 yesterday morning, a couple at No. 451 North Henan Road committed suicide one after another due to economic hardship. The husband, named Shen Shucheng, 42 years old, hanged himself. The wife, Wu, 39 years old, died from ingesting poison. It is truly tragic.

### Charitable Bazaar and Dance Party Thanks All Sectors

The charitable bazaar and dance party has now come to a successful conclusion. Yesterday, the association sent a letter of thanks to all sectors, saying, "We are extremely grateful for the enthusiastic support and generous contributions from all sectors for this charity bazaar and dance party. However, due to limited space, the reception was inadequate in many respects. We sincerely apologize and hope for your understanding."

### YMCA Meal Subsidy Donations Exceed 10,000 Yuan

The donations for the YMCA's student meal subsidy have continued to pour in from all sectors. We still hope that all sectors will continue to assist. The donations received are listed below: Li Bangxian 100 yuan, Jiuda Trading Company 1,000 yuan, Zhao Kongyan 500 yuan, Guohua Insurance Company 100 yuan, Qiantai Company 100 yuan, Dr. Li Haoshan via Muhuajiang Affiliated Middle School student Zhang Jiasheng 20 yuan, Zai Junxin 5 yuan, Zhang Biyun and Dong Yafen 1 yuan each, Yang Suning and Li Shaohuan 5 yuan each, Li Shaoliang 15 yuan, Qi Liu Yang 5 yuan, Zhou Xiuying 5 yuan, Zhu Jin'e, Cheng Xinci, Wang Wenzao, Wu Aili, and Wang Li 1 yuan each, Chen Shiying, Lü Peiying, Tang Huiying, Cai Jianhua, Mrs. Zhang, and Huang Chenghui 5 yuan each, Cai Jinji 20 yuan. The total is 1,917 yuan. Combined with the previous deposit of 9,675 yuan, the total is 11,592 yuan. However, the donation target of the association is 50,000 yuan, which is still far from the goal. We still hope that donations will continue to pour in from all sectors to complete this charitable act.

### New Pu Yu Tang Struggling to Maintain Operations Due to Exhausted Funds

The New Pu Yu Tang provides care for over 1,000 elderly, young, disabled, and orphaned children. The monthly expenditure is at least 70,000 yuan. This expense relies solely on donations from all sectors, with no other source. Since the beginning of the year, the administrators have worked hard to sustain the operations and have achieved great results. They have received the sympathy and support of enthusiastic people in society, and donations of money and clothing have been continuous, allowing them to barely maintain operations. However, in recent months, donations from all sectors have still been less than half of the expenses, causing the institution's funds to gradually dwindle. Once exhausted, the thousand or so orphans and young children will face starvation and death. We urgently hope that benevolent people from all sectors will generously contribute to provide assistance so that they can maintain their lives and avoid falling into a desperate situation. Collection points: (1) Trust Department of the Silk Industry Bank, No. 460 Hankou Road, (2) Jihua Tang Pharmacy, No. 47 Yunnan Road, (3) Huamei Pharmacy, No. 56 Fuzhou Road, (4) Catholic Church, Catholic Church Street, French Concession (also accepting goods).

### A Tour of Six Major Libraries with Rich Collections (Part 1)

Comprehensive Collection of Chinese and Foreign Books, Hoping to Cultivate a Love of Reading Among the Public

The Hongying Library has been preparing for more than ten years, and only opened in the middle of last month. Since Shen Bao published this news, the number of people entering the library to read has suddenly increased several times. Usually there are fifteen or sixteen people each time, and more than thirty people on Sundays. In fact, the library has allowed outsiders to read during the preparation period, only requiring a letter of introduction and no fees. However, the number of readers was not so enthusiastic, which shows that the young people in Shanghai do not lack the habit of going to the library, nor is it due to the weak purchasing power of reading cards, but because they do not know the situation and procedures of the library and are afraid of trouble, which causes various barriers to the library. Therefore, I would like to record the general situation of the libraries in a series of impression notes, to contribute to the readers in need.

Six Library Locations

Currently, there are six larger libraries in Shanghai. Three are in the French Concession: Zhen Dan, Ming Fu, and Hong Ying; the other three are Xin Ya, the Public Works Department, and the Customs. Among these six libraries, only Xin Ya and the Public Works Department are located in the east, and the rest are in the southwest. Moreover, the books of the two libraries in the east and a part of the books of Zhen Dan near the east can be borrowed out of the library, while the three libraries in the west cannot be borrowed out at all, so in terms of opportunity, it is naturally more advantageous for those living in the west.

Xin Ya is on the third floor of the Cishu Building. This building used to be a school and is well known. The Public Works Department Library was originally in the Bund area, but moved to the third floor of the Xiaocaichang on Sima Road, Zhejiang Road. The above two locations are in convenient transportation areas, with several trams directly accessible. The Customs Library is located west of Hed Road on Xinzha Road, the Zhen Dan Library is south of Father Lou Road on Lüban Road, and the Hongying Library is on Xiafei Road, Baisai Zhong Road, all of which are accessible by tram. Only the Ming Fu Library is relatively remote, with no tram lines. In fact, remoteness and tranquility are always related. The more remote the place, the better the reading environment. Among the six libraries listed above, the first four have signs outside the door, but the latter two do not, so people who go for the first time should remember the door numbers: Hongying is 1413 Xiafei Road, and Ming Fu is 533 Albert Road.

Each Has Its Own Specialization

Except for Xin Ya, whose collection focuses on popular books, the other five libraries each have their own specializations. Readers can decide which library to enter based on their needs. Most of the books collected by Zhen Dan are in French. Since the addition of the Ding Family Library and the Li Family Series, it has become a source of series books. From the Bai Chuan Xue Hai of the Song Dynasty to many famous series books in the Ming and Qing Dynasties, it is almost complete. In addition, there is a copy of the Wanyou Wenku, rare books from the Siku, the Sibu Congkan, the Sibu Beiyao, and other books in various subjects, with medicine being the most abundant. Both Chinese and Western medical books are available, making it a good place for those studying Sinology and medicine. The Customs collection is mainly composed of economics, statistics, commerce and other materials, followed by local chronicles, mostly compiled in the Qing Dynasty, and its richness is the first among the six libraries in Shanghai. In addition, there are also many aspects of anecdotes, and the series books are mostly carved editions of the Qing Dynasty, such as the Anhui Series, the Zhu Series, the Mao Series... Although the number is small, they are often lacking in other libraries. Hongying's collection is mostly in the fields of history and geography, with local chronicles slightly inferior to the Customs. The Public Works Department has fewer Chinese books, and most of the popular works in various subjects are available. Recently, it has purchased a large number of Commercial Press's Small Series of Chinese Studies and Basic Series of Chinese Studies, so it is most suitable for beginners in Chinese Studies. Translated novels are very abundant, and recently works by Zhang Henshui and others have been added. Some of the Chinese books in the Ming Fu Library are often not available, while some extremely small classics are collected. Some pamphlets or monographs donated by academic groups are often lacking outside, but can be seen here. Generally speaking, there are more and better books in the fields of mathematics, physics, engineering, chemistry, machinery and textiles.

The above only refers to scattered single books. Other large series of books printed in the market often include many single books. The Wanyou Wenku is collected in two sets in Xin Ya and Zhen Dan. The Public Works Department has a selection of two sets. Rare books from the Siku and the Sibu Congkan are available in the Public Works Department and Zhen Dan, while Xin Ya only has a collection of the first edition of the latter. The Series Integration is seen in Hongying and the Public Works Department, but the latter is not yet cataloged.

Documentary Data

Western books: Xin Ya is almost completely lacking, Hongying has some statistical data, and Zhen Dan is almost entirely French. Therefore, the library only has half of the English books. The Customs collection has the most economics, and many books written by Westerners about the situation in our country. The Western books in the Ming Fu Library are quite common, not only are physics, chemistry, mathematics, engineering, and machinery very rich, but also biographies, novels, literature, and other categories are also very impressive. The Western books in the Public Works Department are divided into three categories: fiction, non-fiction, and children's books (marked with the letter J). Novels account for the majority, and there is also a detective novel section, with stars on the spine as a sign, placed on another shelf for detective fans to choose from. Among the non-fiction books, biographies and bibliography are the most abundant, and many of the other subjects are first-class masterpieces from the previous century and decades ago, which are difficult to see elsewhere. As for new books in this area, there are relatively few.

Books are the refined crystallization of knowledge and information. Many specialized materials still depend on articles and magazines. The collection of newspapers and magazines is the greatest feature of the Hongying Library. Since 1926 and 1927, the library has been collecting Chinese magazines and university publications since 1926 and 1927, like bamboo shoots after a rain. No matter where they are published, whether in the north or south, as long as they are not for casual entertainment and have documentary evidence, they are collected without exception. Even magazines from before 1926 and 1927 are collected in many ways. The library's collection is closely related to history. Many once-popular books were easy to obtain at the time, but over time, they either went out of print or bookstores closed down, becoming rare books and becoming more precious. Newspapers and magazines, this situation is clearly significant. In addition, among the magazines in the other libraries, the Ming Fu Library has the second most, but most of them are waiting to be cataloged. The Customs Library has collected quite a few periodicals from the late Qing Dynasty and the early Republic of China, such as Xinmin Bao, Jiayin Magazine, and New Youth. Zhen Dan only has a few scattered famous magazines, mainly in medicine. The Ming Fu Library has many Western periodicals and documents, such as the abstracts of journals of physics, chemistry, and engineering, which are very useful for business operators, so the library welcomes cooperation with factories. The Public Works Department has many popular Western magazines, and the bound volumes can be borrowed out of the library.

Reference Books

Libraries not only provide readable books, but also provide reference charts, dictionaries, indexes, and other so-called reference books. These books are placed on the shelves and people are free to read them, but in any case, they are not allowed to be borrowed. Books are marked with R, which is the abbreviation of reference. The Public Works Department has the most Western reference books, not only are all subjects complete, but also Western books about China's national conditions and art are also included. However, they are locked in glass cabinets, and you must call a worker to read them. Hongying has the most Chinese reference books, not only are all kinds of dictionaries complete, but also astronomical calendars, gazetteer summaries, periodical indexes, and the supplements to the Four Histories of the North and the Ten General Records are all on the shelves for reading. Other books such as the Qing Dynasty Qixian Leizheng, the birth and death dates of famous people in various dynasties, the stele biographies, and the Siku Zongmu Tiyao Series Sub-Index are not on the shelves, but are also collected. The Customs Library has several detailed indexes on economics and statistics that cannot be seen elsewhere. In addition, there are the most Chinese and Western who's who's. The Ming Fu Library has all the science and science pictorials, and other reference books are naturally aimed at engineering, chemistry, and other fields. The British encyclopedia is the most common. Except for Xin Ya, all five have them, but the editions are different and the content is different. Zhen Dan's is the oldest, followed by Customs and Ming Fu, and Hongying and the Public Works Department are the newest. In addition, the American Zhang's Encyclopedia is stored in the Customs, the French one is stored in Zhen Dan, and the Japanese Encyclopedia Dictionary is stored in Hongying.

There is also a category of books called classified books, which are also collections of various books. These books are divided into categories and disassembled, unlike series books that restore their original appearance. This is a tool for poets and is also very important for general reference. Zhen Dan has the richest collection of classified books, and almost every library has ordinary books such as the Peiwun Yunfu.

### Self-Police Cup Charity Football Game Important Meeting to Be Held Today

Discussing the Mixed Team Selection of Westerners and Others, the Western Football Association Will Also Hold a Meeting Today to Discuss

Yesterday's Newspaper Broadcast Time: 7:20 PM

Organized by the Public Concession Baojia Guidance Committee of this city, the Self-Police Cup Chinese and Western Football Charity Competition, the friendly match between the Joint Friendship Team and the Mixed Team, is scheduled to be held this Sunday (the day after tomorrow) at Jiaozhou Park. The news has spread, and football fans are delighted. Tickets have been pre-sold at the four major companies in recent days, and new records have been set daily. The pre-sale amount may be difficult to maintain for the next two days, and temporary ticket sales on the day are said to be in greater demand than supply. As for the lineups of both sides, they have been actively preparing in recent days, selecting players. Because the Mixed Team needs to strengthen its forces, it has entrusted the Western Football Association to form a special selection committee to handle the matter, in order to focus on the responsibility and concentrate the elite foreign forces in Shanghai into one, in order to form a fighting force and fight the Joint Friendship Team with their backs to the wall. The special selection committee formed by the Western Football Association convened a meeting yesterday evening to discuss the lineup of the Mixed Team that will be competing with the Joint Friendship Team this week. At that time, the selection of personnel was extremely strict. For the sake of prudence, a second meeting will be convened this afternoon before a decision can be made. The meeting place has been decided to be held at the Huizhong Hotel on the Bund of Nanjing Road. At that time, relevant parties will attend, and the vice president, Mr. Shen Siliang, will also attend this important meeting. According to the news from the secretariat of the Western Football Association, the association is scheduled to hold a meeting today to discuss the Self-Police Cup football issue.

### 乙戊 Public Bonds Wildly Plunge to Halt Trading

Yesterday, the unofficial trading of public bonds continued its sharp decline. Selling pressure was extremely heavy, and various factions emerged, causing market prices to fall sharply. Because there were usually too many bulls, the market collapsed. Type C shares briefly rebounded when trading opened, reaching three yuan, but the decline quickly resumed, breaking through levels all the way down, even breaking through the four yuan and sixty yuan marks, reaching a low of 59.8 yuan. Types B and E bonds then plunged to their trading halts. At that time, all five types of public bonds were within 60 yuan. Afterwards, when Types B and E bonds reached their halt prices, some people bought them, and the market prices rebounded. Type B rebounded by 1.8 yuan above its halt price, and Type E rebounded by 2 yuan above its halt price, but all transactions occurred after the trading halts. Therefore, the price drops for various bonds were quite uneven, and the trend remains unstable, creating a tumultuous situation and causing unease. The final market results, except for Types B and E which halted trading due to the drop, saw declines of only six, eight, nine jiao to one yuan and two jiao. The volume of settled transactions was approximately 3.78 million to 3.8 million yuan. A simplified table is provided below.

The China Book Company saw a rise of 27.5 yuan on the day, surging from 300 yuan to 327.5 yuan, then to 317.5 yuan, an increase of 12.5 yuan, also rising for three days for a total gain of 47.5 yuan, a particularly large increase. The World Book Company has seen increased buying interest since the 15th of this month, and yesterday it soared another 12 yuan, reaching a new high price of 116 yuan (a cumulative increase of 45 yuan over thirteen trading days, excluding Sundays).

Wing On and Chinese Goods Company both returned to the 120 yuan level. Sincere reached 134 yuan, each rising by one to three yuan. Underwear slightly rose to around 32 yuan.

Sino-French was at 87.25 yuan, Minyi at 84.5 yuan, and Sino-Western at 455 yuan, all being closing prices, with gains ranging from one to ten yuan. Star Perfume was at 250 yuan, and Guanshengyuan was priced around 252.5 yuan. In the electrical appliance industry, Gongxin Electric was favored by investors due to the factory recently receiving a large order from North China, rising to 16.25 yuan with buyers. Public utilities, such as China Electric, weakened, down 0.5 yuan. Zhabei Water and Electricity remained unchanged at around 41 yuan. Xinhua Paint was strong, with few other changes.

### Worldly Turmoil Arises from Pursuit of Profit

— Yiran

"Not blossoming in spring, intending to wait for autumn, yet failing to bear fruit in autumn, who will bear the blame?" We cannot help but feel regret for those who squander their lives.

Humans are ultimately unable to escape the pursuit of fame and fortune, especially in today's society. Who does not want to be a paragon of both fame and fortune? However, pursuing profit will never lead to fame, and pursuing fame will never lead to profit. It is better to value fame over profit, and it is better to value substance over fame.

Today's paragons who pursue profit are everywhere, while those who pursue substance are few and far between. Reluctantly seeking the next best thing, those who pursue fame are still rare. This is why there is constant turmoil and no peaceful days.

In reality, true substance brings true fame. Pursuing substance is the true goal of humanity.

### Treatment for Crab Poisoning

— Song Daren

The October 17th newspaper reported that an individual surnamed Yin in Yu Garden Road consumed a large quantity of lake crabs, resulting in severe abdominal pain and unconsciousness. Daren believes that crab poisoning can be divided into two categories: 1. Acute poisoning. 2. Allergic reaction to protein. The latter, although not very serious, is frequently encountered. Therefore, I will discuss them separately below:

(1) Acute Poisoning: Aquatic animals such as fish, shrimp, and crabs often contain potent toxins due to seasonal factors, species variations, and pathological conditions (parasites), especially in leftover or spoiled food. These toxins can induce poisoning or acute gastritis. The symptoms are quite complex, such as cholera-like vomiting and diarrhea, severe abdominal pain, difficulty swallowing, visual impairment, convulsions, weakness, palpitations, petechial hemorrhage, and even death. In addition, it can develop into typhoid-like symptoms.

The treatment lies in removing the toxic food, such as by gastric lavage and administering emetics or laxatives to empty the stomach. Then, use tonics such as camphor, concentrated coffee, and Lignor A. ammon auiat to maintain the patient's strength. Intestinal toxins can also be absorbed using astringents such as animal charcoal.

(2) Allergic Reaction to Protein: When foreign proteins are injected subcutaneously into the body, they can cause allergic symptoms such as abdominal pain, cramps, and collapse. If introduced through the esophagus, the proteins are broken down by digestive fluids, so there is no allergic reaction. Because of the strong specificity of crab proteins, even a small amount of absorbed bound amino acids can cause allergic symptoms, but they are not very severe. Usually, only stomach pain, abdominal pain, and urticaria (commonly known as hives) occur. These symptoms vary depending on the individual's constitution. Some are extremely sensitive to lake crabs, while others have no reaction at all.

Treatment involves using stomachics such as ginger juice to promote the secretion of digestive fluids and completely break down these specific proteins. In addition, if there is only mild stomach pain or abdominal pain, painkillers can be used to control it, or it can be left to resolve naturally. We can also use calcium supplements to enhance the body's resistance. These calcium supplements are especially effective for urticaria.

In general, although crabs do not carry the same risks as pork, it is best for the weak or sick, especially those with stomach problems, to avoid them altogether. The occurrence of allergic reactions can worsen the disease, not to mention poisoning. As for the selection of crabs, choose those that have no abnormalities. Dead crabs, raw crabs, or crabs that have been left out for too long all pose a risk of poisoning and should be avoided. If poisoning does occur, soapy water can be used to induce vomiting, and the patient should be taken to the hospital immediately if possible. As for perilla and ginger, they only promote the secretion of gastric juices and have no detoxifying effect. This is also something we should know. The Double Ninth Festival has just passed, and chrysanthemums are about to bloom. It is time to enjoy crabs with wine. I have written these few words to inform those who eat crabs.

### Student Third-Class Car Movement

— Leke

People struggling to make a living amid difficult times feel so oppressed and distressed. This is especially true for parents with many children who feel the burden of life is particularly heavy. In addition to providing living expenses, they also have to provide for their children to go to school.

Every time I go to school in the morning and sit on a third-class car, I feel an indescribable sadness: the well-dressed young ladies and masters who sit in first class, dressed in silk and wool, decorated very elegantly. Are these young men and women studying for the sake of learning? This raises a big question in my mind.

We are still young people living off our parents' support, and many of us are already adults. As the ancient saying goes, "People value independence," and we cannot yet support ourselves. How ashamed we should be. Can we still live such extravagant lives?

I believe that using one less penny of our parents' money shows a higher degree of self-reliance. Sitting on a third-class car is not a disgrace. It is just a demonstration of the spirit of our student days. Many of the school's teachers, who are poor, are sitting in third-class cars. Does this mean that their personalities are inferior?

Those who sit in third-class cars are not all uneducated, poor, and stupid. We can rest assured. Young people with ambition, if they think deeply about this issue, will not think that what I say is wrong.

Therefore, I think that all young classmates who love their parents and consider their hardships should implement the third-class car movement.

### Sweetness

— Yang Gan

Sweetness is a beautiful flower that grows among thorns!

Sweetness is a rose surrounded by prickles!

Sweetness is a pure white flower, yet it lives from a clumsy root!

Whatever the sweetness, it is tempered with sourness!

We ought to value the slightest pain,

For you shall be the one who obtains the final joy.

### The Scholar is Useless

— Gou Wen

Reading Mr. Gang's article "The Scholar is Useless" on the 27th gave me a chill. It is not only a wake-up call for scholars, but also a sympathetic resonance for them. After all, the environment is changing, and the times are changing every day. Of course, today's scholars must also change. They cannot be like the old-fashioned scholars who hold a book all day long, shaking their heads and humming the words of Confucius, "To learn and practice constantly." Nor can they simply walk away to Shouyang Mountain when they are unhappy, like Boyi and Shuqi. Although I dare not slander the virtues of the wise, I feel that they were too assertive. I believe that studying is one thing, and achieving prominence is another. They cannot be combined into one. Therefore, studying is valuable because it clarifies principles and distinguishes right from wrong. If one deserves the benefits, then one should certainly receive them. If one does not deserve the benefits, then one should not pursue them. Do not let greed cloud your judgment and regard yourself as a hero who understands the times. This would spoil the true meaning of studying.

Do not misunderstand! The so-called modern scholar is not asked to recite a few "zhī hū yě zhě" from old-fashioned books. Nor is it hoped that they will become village teachers like the Monkey King in the future, or owners of small "learning" shops in shikumen buildings. This is truly unfair and disappointing. We must not wait for the pen to bloom or dream of the clichés of the chapter novels about "a fallen prince who unexpectedly wins the top prize in the imperial examination." The books we read today are almost all related to practical applications: science, industry, and other new knowledge and academic disciplines. The purpose of learning is to apply it, not to recite dead books and sit on cold benches as a legitimate transaction. Of course, we must engage in industry, business, and enterprise in a regular way. Many emerging industries are waiting for a group of newly educated scholars to develop a welfare society. In other words, hoarding the new knowledge learned today is preparing a magic weapon for future application. It is much better than hoarding Western medicine and department store goods like merchants. I also believe that hoarding knowledge will definitely be subject to price controls by the authorities. I hope that you will act rationally and with conscience, and you will not be disappointed. Do not curse the rich gentry who are greedy and acquisitive. At the same time, do not be discouraged by the idea that scholars are useless and lament your fate!

### Sharing the Same Boat

— He Jia Zhi

(10) Flying Peak

Weicheng said, "You are so sincere that I am so grateful I don't know what to say. But I have forgotten Chen Guofang for a long time. Look how long it has been since she wrote a letter, and how long it has been since I mentioned her." As he spoke, he flipped through the history books, just like Cuizhen, with choked laughter. Cuizhen tugged at the corner of her clothes, rolled it up and straightened it again, looked at Weicheng, then lowered her eyelids and said, "If you and Miss Chen become estranged, naturally she won't be on your mind. If Miss Chen also lived in the Shidetang, she would definitely be on your mind, and you would be on her mind. You would naturally feel that Miss Chen is the most suitable person to be your new wife. Brother Cheng, if Miss Chen comes, and she calls me 'Sister Cuizhen' like Brother Cheng, I will have no worries." Cuizhen turned her face away and looked out the door. It wasn't that she was afraid someone would come in and overhear, but that she was afraid Weicheng would stare at her face.

Weicheng laughed and said, "She, she's busy. She's someone who wants to contribute to the country, not someone who is willing to contribute to the family. Sister Cuizhen says she is the most suitable to be a daughter-in-law of the Ye family, but I say she is exactly the opposite. I have no intention of looking for her, and I don't even bother to write a letter. You know that. I used to think that marriage should not be constrained by the ancient saying that one should marry at thirty, but I also felt that it should be after one has a career. Now, for another reason, I feel the need to start a family. It is not too late to start a career after starting a family. Sister Cuizhen, I can't make my words more pleasing to your ears, just these honest few words. I will also discuss it with my aunt. My aunt wants to have a fortune teller calculate the birth dates and times of the two of us. I agree too. She probably already secretly calculated it for us. She said that it wouldn't be perfect, but it would be at least seven or eight out of ten. Seven out of ten is enough. Sister Cuizhen, don't laugh at me, I'm so corrupted now. As long as people say it's good, I have no reason to say it's not, not like that craze for Europeanization a few years ago. Sister Cuizhen..." He threw the book in his hand and walked to Cuizhen. Cuizhen was still looking out the door. Only when Weicheng was only a foot away from Cuizhen did she blush and stand up. (216)

### Poet, Diploma, and Spring Weariness

— Yuan Ying

Old K, during his time at school, was recognized as someone who was quite adept at dealing with money. He had a very grand ambition: to revitalize commerce and improve the distorted market. Old K was studying economics.

Little Xu, our poet, and Old K were both outstanding talents among us. He always wore a semi-new suit and had very long artistic hair. Our poet planned to dedicate his life to new poetry, publishing several volumes of poetry each year, and using the royalties to earn a living. However, less than three months after leaving school, instead of hearing about Old K's ambition, friends brought us a surprising piece of news: Old K had partnered with the poet to open a small snack shop on ×× Road, selling fried spring rolls. Many friends had already been guests, and it was said that the taste was quite good.

Yesterday, I happened to walk past ×× Road and suddenly thought of Old K and the poet. I found their shop in a street-front room with a single storefront. A sign reading "Delicious Snack Shop" was pasted horizontally on the door, and it was clear that the poet's brushstrokes were no different from those on the cover of the class magazine back then.

A set of "tools for making money" for frying spring rolls was installed facing the street. Hey, Old K was using chopsticks to flip the golden spring rolls frying in the pot!

"Hey Old K! Long time no see!" Our poet was inside mixing flour! "Sit down for a while and eat a few spring rolls!"

"I'm very sorry!" I sat down opposite the poet. "When did you guys open shop? I forgot to send a gift!"

So the poet wiped his long hair and told me in detail how he had tried every avenue after graduation but couldn't find a stable job. He had held his diploma and applied for newspaper advertisements for "Home Tutor," "Senior Class Teacher," "Editor," and various "Jobs Wanted," but the results were always the same: he was sent back empty-handed. Old K was in the same situation. He entered a bank and was laid off. So they met, and Old K had an idea. He came up with a plan, and then...

Two guests came to the seating area and ordered two servings of spring rolls. Old K immediately brought over two plates, while the poet was busy collecting payment from another guest.

"Is business good?"

"So-so!" Our poet had actually learned the routine: "We can always sustain our three meals a day. Business is sometimes good and sometimes slow, because spring rolls aren't anything new!"

At this moment, the business in the seating area suddenly picked up. The four chairs were almost full. Even with my help, it wasn't enough. Old K was carrying plates back and forth, and the poet was sitting at the counter, busy with cash flowing in and out, very familiar with collecting and giving change.

"Why are you still wearing a suit?" After the business subsided, I suddenly noticed that the poet was still wearing that semi-new suit.

"This is called a gimmick!" The poet replied seriously: "It's more effective than a price-reduction advertisement! When people see a college student in a suit frying spring rolls, they naturally walk in."

Old K brought over half of the dozen or so fried spring rolls and joined our conversation.

"This is called involuntary! He handed me a pair of chopsticks. "Whatever position the environment gives you, you have to accept it! When we were at school, who would have thought that we would open a snack shop after graduation? But what other choice is there?"

"That's a fact!" The poet continued: "Diplomas and poetry are useless! Only spring rolls can save us!"

"But," I said after chewing the first spring roll: "The fact that you were able to come up with this solution in a helpless environment is something you can be proud of!"

"I discussed it with the poet," Old K announced his new plan: "When we have the opportunity, we will expand this snack shop into a tea room, restaurant, and even a hotel!"

"Then we'll invite you to be the chairman!" The poet patted me on the shoulder.

"This plan will definitely come true!" These were the words I said to them when I left, and also the first question I thought about on the way home. The realization of the hotel must not be far off, otherwise, how would they have come up with the idea of opening a snack shop in a helpless situation?

"That's a fact!" I thought again of the poet's words, "Diplomas and poetry are useless! Only spring rolls can save us!"

Roads are made by people walking; spring rolls are also fried by themselves.
