### Suburbs of Stalingrad: An Unprecedentedly Bloody Espionage History War; German Troops Use Flamethrowers to Attack, Attempting to Destroy the Soviet Current Grid

Moscow, 8th (Allied News Agency) – The Soviet Information Bureau's midnight bulletin stated that on the 7th of this month, Soviet troops were still fiercely fighting southwest and southwest of Stalingrad.

Stockholm, 8th (Allied News Agency) – According to news from London, all telephone and wireless communications between Moscow and Stalingrad have been re-established and are reportedly focusing on large-scale new offensives at vulnerable points attacked in the past three days, with the most important being in the central region. This speculation is further reinforced by yesterday's broadcast from Moscow Radio. According to the Soviet radio announcement, German troops have launched several attacks on the western side of the city's defenses. The intensity is greater than before, and the defending troops have been forced to retreat. This is the first time that the Soviet war report has mentioned the western part of the city's defenses. In the southwest of Stalingrad, the German offensive has not weakened, but the defending troops are also persisting without retreating. To the north and northwest of Stalingrad, Soviet troops are in a dominant position and have launched several counterattacks yesterday, breaking through the German encirclement line. According to the German side, 192 Soviet tanks were destroyed in one day. The intensity of the offensive can be seen from this. However, the German army is determined to capture Stalingrad, regardless of any sacrifice.

Somewhere on the Soviet border, 7th (Havas Agency) – Today is the 42nd day of the war on the Eastern Front. The situation on each front is as follows: The suburbs of Stalingrad are witnessing an inextricably bloody battle. This battle can be described as unprecedented in history. The Red Army is relying on extremely strong defensive fortifications to resist valiantly. German troops must pass through a vast minefield with a line of bunkers as a barrier. In addition, the Red Army trenches are protected by electrified barbed wire, and cannons are hidden in underground gun emplacements. The German army has no way out and is using flamethrowers in an attempt to destroy these fortifications. The entire city has become a fortress, with obstacles everywhere. Even the most remote places inside the houses are covered with landmines. Therefore, anyone who enters a house and accidentally triggers a mechanism will see the entire house collapse. The danger is like this. On the east bank of the Volga River, the Red Army has established many artillery positions, constantly bombarding the German defense lines. Everything proves that the Red Army can still resist for several days, but the final result is undoubtedly hopeless. On the western front of the Caucasus, German troops are advancing south of Novorossiysk. The Soviet fleet has sailed into the high seas, seemingly aiming for Batumi. However, it is very difficult for the Red Army to prevent German troops from landing on the Black Sea coast of the Caucasus. The resistance of the Red Army in the eastern Caucasus, especially in the Grozny region and the Terek front, seems to have strengthened, but it is still not enough to stop the German advance. The situation in the central region is unclear. Generally, the terrain there is rugged, making it very difficult for the German army to march. The fighting on the Rzhev and Kaluga fronts was not fierce yesterday, as some of the Red Army in that area has been transferred to the Stalingrad front to help in the battle.

Helsinki, 8th (Haitong News Agency) – According to Finnish war reports, the situation on each front is quiet. Finnish artillery bombarded enemy fortresses and supply columns. Infantry also repelled enemy reconnaissance teams. The air force could not operate due to bad weather.

German Führer's Headquarters, 8th (Haitong News Agency) - Soviet troops suffered heavy casualties in the Battle of Novorossiysk, with 6,758 people captured. German troops also seized 14 armored vehicles, 90 cannons, a train of armored vehicles, several ships, and many other war materials. German aircraft launched low-altitude attacks on the transportation lines southwest of the city. On the Terek front, German troops counterattacked, destroying 100 Soviet tanks. German aircraft shot down 27 Soviet aircraft. German troops continued to advance in the Stalingrad area, and German aircraft also assisted in the battle. The bridge marks on the Volga River south of the city were bombed day and night. The situation in the central part of the eastern front was quiet. Soviet troops launched several attacks in the Leningrad area, but all were repelled. Yesterday and the day before, the air forces of Germany, Italy, and Hungary shot down 125 Soviet aircraft, and another 40 were shot down by anti-aircraft guns. Three aircraft were destroyed while damaged in flight. Five Axis aircraft went missing.

Berlin, 8th (Haitong News Agency) – A German supplementary war report stated that the Soviet counterattack southwest of Kaluga on September 6 failed. The enemy launched a counterattack with artillery cover northwest of Medyn, but also made no progress. German aircraft assisted in the battle, destroying many enemy tanks. Soviet counterattacks around Lake Ilmen and the Volkhov area were also repelled. A Soviet regiment of about one division attacked with tanks south of Lake Ladoga and was defeated. German counterattacks made progress, killing 1,200 enemy soldiers. In the Leningrad area, German aircraft and anti-aircraft guns shot down three enemy aircraft.

### German Troops in Crimea Will Be Transferred to the Caucasus

Berlin, 8th (Haitong News Agency) – The German High Command announced last night that Romanian troops had captured and secured an armed village on the southern route of the Stalingrad front. Despite the Soviet army's desperate counterattacks, the Romanian army did not waver. A Soviet army infantry brigade attacked along the Stalingrad railway line but was repelled by the German army, suffering heavy losses. The activities of the German Air Force focused on tanks and fortress positions within the Stalingrad defense zone. Deeply fortified Soviet fortresses were destroyed by German aircraft. German aircraft also attacked large groups of Soviet reinforcements with bombs and machine guns at low altitude. Soviet aircraft attempted to fly into German airspace but were repelled by anti-aircraft guns. A Soviet gunboat on the Volga River was damaged. German fighter planes shot down 37 Soviet aircraft, and another 11 were shot down by anti-aircraft guns.

Berlin, 8th (Haitong News Agency) – Fierce fighting continued on the northern flank of the Stalingrad front. Soviet troops launched another fierce attack on the German front line with large groups of infantry and tanks, but did not succeed. Instead, 192 tanks were destroyed by German troops. The German High Command had long anticipated this move by the Soviet army and had deployed the necessary troops to counterattack head-on and thwart their plan. Stalingrad is still in fierce fighting. Although there are reports from abroad that German troops have broken into the city, well-informed German sources have not commented on this, only stating that the German vanguard is now advancing towards the outskirts of the city. After the Axis forces occupied the port of Novorossiysk on the Black Sea, they toppled the strong pillar of the Soviet army on the Caucasus front. German troops can now continue to advance towards Transcaucasia without encountering attacks on their flanks. After the end of the fighting on the Taman Peninsula, the Kuban region can be said to be entirely in German hands. At the same time, the front line has been shortened. Currently, the progress of clearing out the remaining enemy troops in that area is quite smooth. The German troops in Crimea are now free and can be transferred to fight south of the western Caucasus. The German mountain troops are operating in the Caucasus. After reaching the coast, they will continue to advance with their remaining power, thereby threatening the enemy's flanks and rear. The Soviet High Command has also realized this danger. Therefore, after the German-Romanian forces occupied Novorossiysk, they launched a counterattack on the city at the cost of sacrifice, but were also met with a head-on counterattack by the German army, and German aircraft forced them to retreat. The troops advancing towards the Terek front continued to make progress. According to well-informed sources here, the fighting on the Terek front is very fierce, and the Soviet army is putting up strong resistance for every inch of territory. In the central Caucasus, due to the mountainous roads, it takes 10 to 16 horses to tow each cannon, which makes it difficult for the German army.

### Roosevelt's "Fireside Chat": Controlling Prices, Stabilizing Currency; Stabilizing All Prices to Prevent Inflation; Message to Congress Requesting Immediate Enactment of Law

Argentine Capital, 7th (Associated Press dispatch from Washington) - The gist of Roosevelt's fireside chat regarding price controls and currency measures is as follows: Our efforts to complete the war are still insufficient. In my previous message to Congress, I explained that inflation and rising living costs are causing an economic crisis in the United States. Living costs have increased by 15% from January 1st of last year to May of this year. The government implemented measures in May to limit prices, wages, and rents in order to prevent this trend. However, because Congress did not include agricultural products in these control measures, the government's plan could not be fully implemented. Therefore, several weeks ago, I again requested Congress to stabilize agricultural prices. However, to seek a reduction in living costs and secondly to stabilize agricultural product prices is already past due. There are two important issues before Congress: first, taxation; these two must be legislated quickly. In terms of suppressing the prices of necessities, the prices of all living materials must be controlled so that living costs do not rise further. If this issue cannot be resolved today, it will be even more difficult for the United States to achieve victory in the war. Therefore, I request Congress to authorize me with the power to stabilize the prices of all necessities, including all agricultural products. At the same time, I hope that the wage issue can also be resolved before October 1st. If Congress cannot immediately determine countermeasures, or if the countermeasures determined are not applicable, then I will establish countermeasures myself in relation to my duties, etc.

Argentine Capital, 8th (Associated Press dispatch from Washington) - Before President Roosevelt's fireside chat on the night of the 7th, he sent a message to Congress requesting authorization for the President to control prices, control wages (including stabilizing national living expenses and agricultural product prices), and stated that even if Congress does not approve granting this necessary authority, Roosevelt alone will take full responsibility and implement this measure to suppress inflation.

Lisbon, 8th (Haitong News Agency dispatch) - It has been learned that the U.S. Congress is scheduled to convene on the 14th of this month because President Roosevelt has requested Congress to pass a bill before October 1st authorizing the President to regulate various prices in order to avoid currency inflation, so Congress has shortened its summer vacation, it is said.

European Situation: Also Mentioned

Lisbon, 8th (Haitong News Agency) - Washington dispatch: President Roosevelt's recent fireside chat, in addition to warning of the danger of inflation, also guaranteed that one day an offensive will be launched against the enemy. The content did not exceed expectations. Roosevelt strongly stated that in order to eliminate the domestic economic crisis, he would not hesitate to take necessary measures immediately, otherwise it may be too late. Roosevelt also pointed out that next year's U.S. war expenditure will reach ten trillion U.S. dollars. Regarding the situation in Europe and the Pacific, he said: The goal in Europe is to launch an offensive against Germany. There are at least a dozen places where we can advance. Although the detailed plan of the offensive has not been conveniently announced, I dare to guarantee that the United Kingdom and the United States are now engaged in preparations. The power of Germany must be destroyed on the European battlefield. Some people advocate concentrating forces on one thing and not dispersing their strength by taking care of too many things. However, I believe that the United States cannot stop assisting the Soviet Union, withdraw from the Pacific, hand over the Near East and the Mediterranean to the Germans, or abandon the offensive against Germany. In the Mediterranean and Near East, fierce battles are underway. We know that the future is full of dangers, but we are not yet hopeless. The spirit of Soviet resistance is admirable. With the support of the Allied countries, the Soviet Union, although repeatedly defeated, will not collapse. Now, in military terms, we have many important statutes, and their goals are all to launch an offensive, and this offensive does not only refer to aerial offensives. We must use the joint sea, land, and air forces to hope to repel the enemy.

Submitted Message to Both Houses Yesterday

Washington, 7th (Havas News Agency dispatch) - President Roosevelt submitted a message to the Senate and House of Representatives today, requesting the immediate passage of the bills to stabilize living costs and regulate the highest prices of agricultural products. All of these cases must be passed before October 1st of this year, otherwise, he will handle them himself. In the message, the President pointed out that since the United States entered the war, living costs have continued to rise. On August 27th of this year, the government submitted a plan, containing seven items, to try to curb the rampant inflation tide sweeping the country. However, although Congress has been repeatedly advised by the authorities, it still refuses to pass the necessary legislation, because the "farmers' faction" intends to oppose all attempts to limit the prices of agricultural products, so the current prices of food and clothing cannot continue to be maintained for many days. The President's message has obviously attracted general attention. Senator La Follette of Wisconsin (a prominent isolationist in the past) said, "The President's message is issued with a decisive threatening attitude, which is regrettable. His actions are as if he is holding a gun to the Senate." However, at the same time, new regulations restricting consumption have been announced. When the President met with newspaper reporters today, he clearly announced that a method of abstaining from meat for one day each week will soon be implemented. In the future, the meat allowance per person per week will be reduced to two pounds. The proposal for 18- to 19-year-old youths to join the army has also been submitted to the House of Representatives today. If passed, it will also be implemented. In addition, it is also necessary to stabilize wages. In his view, the annual income of anyone in the country, after deducting net income tax, should not exceed $25,000.

Next Year's Military Expenditure: Ten Trillion

Argentine Capital, 8th (Associated Press dispatch) - U.S. President Roosevelt delivered a "fireside" broadcast to the nation on U.S. Labor Day yesterday, saying that next year's U.S. military expenditure will reach ten trillion (10,000,000,000,000) U.S. dollars.

Lisbon, 8th (Associated Press dispatch) - According to a Washington dispatch, U.S. Wartime Human Resources Committee Chairman McNutt said yesterday on Labor Day that the committee is drafting a bill to implement a nationwide conscription system.

Berlin, 7th (Havas News Agency dispatch) - According to official announcements, in recent days, British aircraft groups have repeatedly flown to Germany in daylight to carry out small-scale air raids.

### Director of the U.S. War Production Board Broadcasts to the Labor Sector

Lisbon, 8th (Associated Press dispatch from Washington) - U.S. War Production Board Director Nelson went to the industrial city of Cleveland, Ohio, on the 7th to participate in the Labor Day commemoration meeting and gave a broadcast speech. He criticized American workers a lot, saying that if you really hope to win this war, then you must be aware of the need to endure sacrifices. Strikes or absenteeism are the greatest disloyalty to the country. At a time when materials are difficult, we cannot but criticize laborers for abusing automobiles. We really hope that labor and management can make concessions to each other. The country is now at a critical juncture of survival, and the usual trick of strikes is equivalent to treason.

### Price Controls Take Effect; Investigate Supply Conditions; Prescribe Timely Selling Prices to Improve People's Livelihoods; Hope for Public Cooperation in Price Controls of Vegetables

Shanghai Times: Inagaki, Director of the Goods Control Office of the Municipal Bureau, said when meeting with reporters on [the] 7th that since the authorities jointly issued a proclamation on price controls on September 1, the goods control has been conducting investigations and observations, so there are good ideas on what level retail prices should be set. What the authorities are waiting to do now is to further investigate the supply, manufacture, and distribution of goods, and to set an average ratio for the selling prices between manufacturers, wholesalers, and retailers in order to improve people's livelihoods. What is expressed above is by no means a novel opinion, but other than that, he could not temporarily announce anything on this important issue.

Thorough Investigation of Supply and Distribution: Reporter: What progress has been made in price controls? Inagaki: Since the authorities issued a proclamation on September 1, department stores under control have indeed lowered their selling prices. The reporter then informed him that if the managers of the top ten department stores complained unfairly, that small retailers purchased goods from them at low prices and resold them at high prices in their own department stores, Inagaki claimed that other retailers are now gradually imitating the policy of major department stores, and department store owners and the public should not have this kind of complaint in the near future, because the seriousness of the entire situation requires immediate action, so the authorities have no choice but to start from the end and implement controls, and then gradually trace the source. As a rule, the supply source should be investigated first, and then the manufacturers, wholesalers, and finally the retailers. However, under the current situation, the retail price has been limited first, and now a thorough investigation of supply, manufacture, and distribution has begun.

Careful Consideration of Punishment Measures: The reporter also asked how to punish violators. Inagaki replied that in order for the authorities to achieve true success, they are carefully considering what kind of punishment should be given to violators, but the time to disclose the details of the punishment is not yet ripe. The reporter then cited the example of the price of leather shoes having been reduced. Inagaki said that all consumables are under the consideration of the authorities, but they will be studied in order of their importance to daily life. The strict control of the prices of rice and flour is one example. The rumor that meat has disappeared from the market after the Municipal Council and the Public Works Department limited the price of meat two weeks ago cannot be believed. According to the figures, fresh pigs are transported to Shanghai on schedule, and even more than before. The authorities cannot lower all prices at the same time, because each item must be carefully and thoroughly investigated separately in order to seek the greatest benefit for the residents and at the same time not cut off its supply.

Price Controls of Vegetables: Hope to Report Violations: The Goods Control starts with a thorough investigation and focuses on the selling prices of meat, vegetables, and poultry. It is hoped that the public will cooperate and report cases of excessively high prices and short weight. Housewives do not have to go to the police station when encountering such situations. They can report to the inspectors of the Municipal Council Health Department office in the nearby vegetable market, or write directly to the Municipal Council Goods Control Office. Inagaki also admitted that the problem of controlling market prices is quite difficult, especially for vegetables, because there are many factors such as seasonality and perishability that must be considered. However, this still aims to control vegetable prices, and is currently working towards this goal. Inagaki concluded by saying that he hopes the public will understand that the authorities are doing their best to suppress prices, patiently waiting for the gradual handling of each item, and hoping that the public will report any violations of price controls at any time.

Prepare Cost Audits and Determine Price Limits: A dispatch from the Alliance News Agency in this city states that in order to allow retailers to obtain reasonable profits, the Municipal Council will likely instruct various industry associations and manufacturers to prepare cost and wholesale price figures and submit them to the Bureau for approval. The retail prices derived by each association from this calculation will be regarded as the maximum limit, and then this price limit will be announced in various newspapers and implemented in both concessions at the same time. Regarding this point, it is reported that the Shanghai Wool Merchants Association has already prepared a list of costs and wholesale prices agreed upon by its members and submitted it to the Municipal Council. The preparation of lists of cotton cloth and other important commodities is being accelerated. Observers indicate that merchants' cooperation can be expected to help promote the city's commercial situation and prevent hoarding trends.

### Public Concession Actively Prepares for Air Defense

Dispatch from the Alliance News Agency in this city: The Japanese-language "Shanghai Mainichi Shimbun" reported yesterday that the air defense guidance headquarters in the Public Concession, with the assistance of relevant authorities, will soon hold air defense exercises such as firefighting, first aid, and evacuation. The detailed measures are now being studied by Matsumoto, Director of the Air Defense Department of the Municipal Council. For air defense purposes, high-rise buildings (such as the International Hotel, Jinmen Hotel, Da Xin, Sincere, and Wing On companies, etc.) will be equipped with various emergency equipment, such as ladders and water hoses.

### More Than a Thousand British Nationals Prepare to Evacuate

The English-language "Greater Shanghai Evening Post" reported that a senior official of the Swiss Consulate General in Shanghai recently told reporters that the consulate is preparing to continue to evacuate British nationals in the city and will quickly register British nationals and select one thousand to one thousand two hundred people and give them priority for evacuation. However, one thousand to one thousand two hundred people is only the highest number of British nationals who may be repatriated next time, and it is not necessarily said that this number of British nationals can be repatriated next time. As for the approximate date of the next evacuation of British nationals and Allied nationals, and the number of ships to be sent, nothing is known. In fact, officials only said that there is a possibility of the next evacuation of British nationals. Also, there is still no news from the Japanese Consulate General about when the two ships that came to Shanghai to transport Americans will sail, and it cannot be verified whether the date of departure of the two ships transmitted by the Swiss Consulate General (originally scheduled for September 9 and 10, has been postponed by about two [weeks?]).

### Fresh Pork Industry Notifies Members to Comply with Price Limits

The Fresh Pork Industry Association notified its members yesterday, saying: "For the purpose of notification, since the people in our industry have been brokers in the livestock market, they have long avoided raising prices and competing for sales, which is completely different from the nature of brokers in ordinary exchanges. The income from commissions is generally based on the market regulations, and the fairness of supply and demand for sales and distribution is the criterion. We also follow the Municipal Council Price Evaluation Committee's limit on the market price of fresh meat to 8.6 yuan per catty, which is fair in terms of normal transactions and should be supported. To eliminate the black market, we advocate calling for the dredging of sources in order to meet the corresponding supply and demand, and to cooperate in implementing price limits to maintain the people's food supply, which is our unshirkable responsibility. However, outsiders who do not understand have openly spread rumors and slandered our industry. In addition to having firmly stated our position and declared the purpose of our industry's fair transactions and honest business, we also remember the saying of the sages, 'The best way to stop is to cultivate oneself.' Therefore, we specially notify our members and each treasure line to understand this purpose, advise their subordinates, and not participate in the black market to avoid being reported and avoid being blamed. This is a special notice."

### Mid-Autumn Settlement Festival Approaching; Banks and Money Shops Adjust Funds

Various Firms Can Apply for Dismantling and Lending of Property

Indirectly Develop Industry and Commerce and Stabilize the Market

The Mid-Autumn Settlement Festival for various industries is approaching in a blink of an eye. Banks, money shops, and various companies, factories, and firms have begun to prepare. In order to adjust the funds of the industry and stabilize the market, the United Bank Preparatory Committee can provide government bonds, Chinese merchant stocks and bonds, and real estate title deeds, public treasury certificates, goods, and other collateral within the Concession to apply for dismantling and lending of funds according to the interim measures for dismantling and lending matters of various firms for member firms that need funds. After the audit is passed and the value is assessed, the loan is granted according to the prescribed discount. After the funds of various firms can be adjusted, their own consolidation can indirectly help the development of industry and commerce. Therefore, although it is the Mid-Autumn Settlement Festival, the scheduling of funds in various industries can be met with ease, and the market finance is still stable, with ample funds and no tension. Various companies and firms have separately urged the collection of previous customer accounts in order to repay the loans due to various firms. If funds are needed, they can also negotiate new loans with various firms. Therefore, the market during this year's Mid-Autumn Festival will be stable, and there will be no problem in safely passing the festival.

### The Guó'ēn Temple Storehouse Monk is Addicted to Gambling Dens

Owes more than a thousand yuan in tofu debts.

Arrested after investigation of debt collection case.

Pǔlì, a monk (54 years old) was hired by the Guó'ēn Temple at No. 239 Wéi'ěrméng Road, French Concession, as the storehouse monk (responsible for purchasing vegetables). Unexpectedly, Pǔlì recently took the money given to him by the Abbot for buying vegetables and gambled it away at gambling dens in the Nánshì area, losing a total of 1,898 yuan. The other day, the owner of the Xīn Yǔ Qí tofu shop on Píngjìlì Road, along with a group of people, went to the Guó'ēn Temple to demand from Abbot Yìnquán (65 years old, from Shāndōng) the tofu money owed over a period of time, amounting to over a thousand yuan. They were very aggressive and insistent. The Abbot was at a loss, as he had never owed anyone money. This led to a quarrel, and they were taken to the Xújiāhuì Police Station. After questioning by the head detective, it was discovered that Pǔlì had been falsely using the Abbot's name to repeatedly buy tofu on credit from the Xīnxīngzhāi Tofu Shop. The detective immediately sent officers to the Guó'ēn Temple to arrest Pǔlì. Under interrogation, Pǔlì confessed, saying that because he had an eighty-year-old mother to support, part of the money was used to supplement the family's income, and part of it was taken to various gambling tables in Nánshì and lost. He begged for mercy and was ordered to be detained for further investigation. He had lost a total of 1,898 yuan.

### Profit-Taking is Common, Bond Market Slightly Weakens

Yesterday, the unified government bond market saw a slight decline. Selling pressure seemed to be strengthening. After several days of sharp increases, some bonds had risen by as much as four yuan. Although demand was still present due to the shortage of chips, many old investors were gradually taking profits. Therefore, if Category C bonds were to hover below three yuan again, the trend might first consolidate before turning firmer again. At the beginning of the morning, buyers were still seen pushing prices up, but the momentum was weak. Category C bonds failed to break through 3.50 yuan, indicating a lack of strength. Sellers recognized this and followed the large investors in selling off their holdings. As a result, bond prices fluctuated and ultimately showed mixed results. Except for Category B bonds, which rose by two jiao, and Category A bonds, which remained unchanged, other bonds fell by one or two jiao. Trading volume was brisk, reaching approximately 3.7 to 3.8 million yuan. A table is listed below.

### Chinese Stocks Remain Popular, Still More Gains than Losses

Yesterday, the Chinese stock market continued to make progress upwards. The overall market sentiment was good. Among the utilities, China General Edison had already risen to the 30 yuan mark, while Zháběi Water & Electricity also reached 34 yuan amid strong buying interest from large investors. Both stocks rose by a significant one yuan each. Secondly, department store stocks were also the target of buyers. Xīnxīn Company stood out, exceeding 100 yuan, while Yǒng'ān also approached the 100 yuan mark. China Products Company also rose sharply, trading above 100 yuan, with increases ranging from three to five yuan compared to the previous day. China Underwear rose by 7.5 jiao. Xīn Yào Company, Xīn Yà, and Zhōngfǎ Machine remained steady. Transactions for Mínyì were scarce and prices were stagnant. Among the cultural stocks, China Bookstore hit a low of 2.5 yuan. Commercial Press and World Bookstore remained flat. Great China Match returned slightly by 2.5 yuan. The new stock, Great China Weaving, fell by 2.5 jiao to within 9 yuan. Fúchāng Dyeing and Weaving remained at the set price. Other stocks also saw more gains than losses. With investors still uncertain, a price table for each stock market is listed below.

Miscellaneous Grains Show Continued Strength

Beans: There were sporadic transactions yesterday, with mixed prices, but the underlying trend remained strong. 20 bags of Bēn Niú red beans were sold at 134 yuan, buyer to collect. 40 bags of Jiāngběi peas were sold at 160 yuan, buyer to return the bags and collect.

Sweet Potato Dried: Actual demand remained good, and the market continued to be strong. Yesterday, 50 bags of Qīngdǎo sweet potato dried were offered at 131.3 yuan, including burlap bags. Another 40 bags in single-wrapped bags were offered at 119 yuan.

Red Sorghum: Actual users only purchased as needed, and the trend was flat. Yesterday, a truckload of Míngguāng new red sorghum was offered at 113.5 yuan. Another 50 bags of old red sorghum were offered at 106 yuan.

Wheat Bran: Rural buyers continued to selectively purchase, so prices were firm. Yesterday, 500 small packages of Sānxīn wheat bran were offered at 113.5 yuan, with 200 bags per warehouse receipt.

### Scarce Settlement Date, Military Tickets Slightly Lower

Yesterday, the foreign exchange market saw a slight decline in Japanese military tickets due to the scarcity of settlement dates and supply exceeding demand among dealers. The price had fallen to 5.5524 yuan, a slight decrease. The difference between the buying and selling prices at the doors of the silver houses and small local banks was very large, with selling prices around 5.565 and 5.57 yuan, and buying prices around 5.545 and 5.54 yuan, which was quite inconsistent.

Yesterday, the interbank lending rate of the Money Trade Association was 0.13 yuan, with new drafts and cash trading at par. Dealers quoted high exchange rates.

New Batch of Huáng Sì Yuán Arrives

Huáng Sì Yuán was very scarce in the market. Recently, a batch of new goods from last year had been transferred from the customer side. After evaluation and opening of the market yesterday, the goods were indeed better than other old goods, and the price was more than 200 yuan higher. However, the customer side had not yet redeemed them, and they would only be able to complete the transaction if the difference was about 50 yards.

Cigarettes: Secondary Goods Dominate

The selling price of cigarettes, secondary goods, was brisk. Sales to customers and local demand were quite strong. Actual sales of middle and upper goods were still sluggish. Dealers had no intention of taking action, so prices continued to weaken. Great Britain brand was 7,900 yuan, Old Knife brand was 5,650 yuan, and Small Fairy brand was 4,300 yuan, a decrease of 100 yuan compared to the previous day. Pǐn Hǎi brand was 5,500 yuan, and Wǔ Huá brand was 4,500 yuan, both remaining stable. Japanese cigarettes Golden Spear brand was 2,270 yuan, Golden Building brand was 2,400 yuan, Red Rose was 1,550 yuan, Quán Lù brand was 2,300 yuan, Niàn Jì was 2,270 yuan, and Guide brand was 1,950 yuan. National cigarettes Golden Pyramid was 4,300 yuan, Beautiful brand was 3,700 yuan, and Golden Rat brand was 2,650 yuan. Platinum Dragon was 3,150 yuan, all showing weakness.

### Extra Work

— Dá

I live in an old shikumen house. This shikumen, like the typical Shanghai lane house, isn't very big, but thanks to the second landlord's clever management, fourteen families live in it, twelve upstairs and two downstairs. Of course, the upstairs is packed (imagine, an average of one and a half families per room). What about downstairs? Although there are only two families, they are shopkeepers, or rather, small factories. The number of people is indeed smaller in the early mornings and evenings, but in the middle of the day, there are women doing "extra work," and the noise they make is no less than that upstairs.

These two factories, one is a cosmetics factory occupying three rooms, and the other is a medicine bag factory occupying one room. But as Heaven knows, the two factories combined don't have a single machine! The cosmetics factory makes perfume, cold cream, etc. Two master craftsmen and one apprentice are the entire technical staff and manufacturing workers. The technology is quite simple: mixing various chemical raw materials in a vat. In addition, there is a writing desk where an accountant sits, the only employee in the factory. Oh, and there is also a runner, played by the boss himself, so he can be considered an employee too. The most important work is putting the perfume and cold cream into bottles, and sticking labels and wrapping paper on the bottles, which is the job of the female workers. Therefore, the number of female workers is greater than the number of technical staff, manufacturing workers, and employees combined, totaling seven. What about the medicine bag factory? Even more pitiful, including the boss and the workers, there are only five people in total. Except for the boss, who is a man, the remaining four workers are all women. The boss acts as the boss, accountant, runner, master craftsman, and apprentice, all in one. His wife also acts as the boss's wife and a worker. The medicine bags are used by Chinese pharmacies to hold a certain type of medicine in a small gauze bag, which is then boiled with other medicines to prevent mixing, so it can be reused. Tea shops also use them. The boss was originally a small clerk in some foreign firm. He lost his job last year and was very poor. Suddenly, he came up with this idea: buying the leftover scraps of gauze from garment factories, cutting them into small pieces, and then sewing them into small bags with thread, selling them to pharmacies by the tens of thousands. Pharmacies originally had to make them themselves, but selling them like this was cheaper and much more convenient, so they were very willing to buy them. Needless to say, the so-called factory is located in the boss's home. A half-painted square table is piled high with thread and cloth. Four women sit around the table, sewing the bags one stitch at a time, while talking about housework and trivial matters, such as arguments between mothers-in-law and daughters-in-law. The boss's wife is also breastfeeding a baby, a child less than a year old. She has to put down her needle from time to time to comfort the child when he suddenly cries.

The female workers in the two factories mentioned above mostly live nearby, and several of them live upstairs. Some are little girls of thirteen or fourteen, some are old women in their fifties or sixties, and some are young women who are about to get married or mothers. Chinese society doesn't seem to include them in the ranks of producers. Therefore, although they are actually unemployed at home, they can't be said to be unemployed. But they do feel the suffering of unemployment—of course, not in the sense of not having food to eat. They feel too idle and bored. (I haven't done any surveys, but I imagine it must be like this.) Good, the clever boss downstairs is recruiting workers: "Come to our place to work, the wages are a little lower, but isn't it good to earn some pocket money? And it also relieves boredom..." Indeed, there's nothing else to do anyway, so it's good to earn some "extra money." They all agree to do it.

The lowness of the wage is enough to make one's hair stand on end. If it weren't for the "relieving boredom" effect, it would be strange if anyone did this work. Speaking of the cosmetics factory, it's based on time, meaning that working more than ten hours a day earns 1.5 to 2.5 yuan, depending on their skill and whether they are good at currying favor. In other words, workers work more than ten hours, and depending on how well they do, they get a bowl of braised pork noodles or a bowl of plain noodles. It's probably a bowl of plain noodles when they first start, then a bowl of vegetable noodles after a while, and then a bowl of braised pork noodles after even longer. As for the medicine bag factory, the needle and thread workers have to provide their own, and each bag earns 2 fen. This is even worse than the cosmetics factory. People with clumsy hands can't even make fifty bags in a whole day, which is less than a yuan. But there is a woman who can make around two hundred bags a day. Her needlework is so fast that at night she is only able to make bags.

One day, I was talking to the boss of the medicine bag factory about the low wages and asked him why he didn't raise them. He smiled bitterly and said, "You mean I'm being heartless, but I really have my own difficulties. My cost is 4 fen per bag. After deducting the 2 fen for labor, I earn 4 fen per bag myself. But I have to figure out the raw materials, I have to figure out the sales channels, and I have to cut the cloth myself. To find workers, I have to talk nicely to acquaintances and persuade them every step of the way. I'm busy all day long, and I have to socialize, but the money I earn is only enough to feed my family..."

"Finding workers requires talking nicely" is truly an interesting thing. It shows how powerful money really is. Whoever suffers a loss on money, their words will be louder. If the boss could offer a wage of 5 fen per bag, I think there would be many people begging the boss to say nice things.

It is said that in some large factories, workers are not allowed to speak while working. Otherwise, not only the boss, but even the lowest-ranking employees, such as foremen, would scold them. Here, workers can just talk loudly while working. For example, in the cosmetics factory, you can hear that the sound is non-stop for half a minute. They laugh raucously for a while, then start arguing, then discuss who is right and who is wrong in the fight between the Zhāng family couple. The accountant sometimes can't stand it anymore and comes to scold them, "Oh, can you be quieter? Can you be quieter?" But as soon as he turns his back, it starts again, although softer, but still audible. They curse, "Dead accountant, damned accountant, shit-eating accountant..." The accountant doesn't know whether to laugh or cry. He's not exactly an honest character. But what can he do? Fire them? The accountant has the power, but the workers don't care, and it's difficult to find a replacement if he fires one. (To be continued)

— Wèi Rén

Last summer, I watched "Mourning in the Qing Palace" and discovered the theater's rare talent—Jiāng Hóng, who played the shrewish and stereotypical Empress Dowager Cixi.

Her original name was Jiǎng Tiānjiàn. She is 22 years old this year. She graduated from Southern Middle School and later went to Suzhou Art College for a year before transferring to the business department of Datong University.

She can speak fluent and correct Mandarin, but she was not born in Beijing. She is from Taicang. According to her, she began learning Mandarin and developing her love for theater during her time at Southern Middle School. The first play she acted in was "Sunrise," in which she played Chén Báilù. She did not understand the personality of this character at all, so the performance was not bad, but in fact, she was a complete failure. This lesson made her more interested in studying theater. She devoted herself to the field of art every day, reading books on theory on the one hand, and watching the acting skills of successful performers on the other. She secretly and silently learned, hoping that one day she would succeed.

In the winter of 1940, the Shanghai Drama Art Society recruited actors, and she went to try out with a pure heart. Her years of hard study gave her the comfort of "victory," and she has had the opportunity to hone her art for a long time since then.

She has played some not very important roles in many plays, such as "Sorrow City," "Love's Labour's Lost," "Song of Righteousness," "Biography of the Second Master," and "Spring." In "Peking Man," she played Ruì Zhēn and made a splash. This time, her role as the actress Liú Yùlián in "The Human World" has further solidified her glorious foundation!

Regarding her stage name, she used the name Liújīn during her time at Shangyi, which is the meaning of separating the character "Jiàn." When performing "Peking Man" with the China Drama Troupe, she changed her name to Jiǎng Tiānliú.

Now she is the rising star of the Huayi Drama Troupe.

She likes to watch movies, and she is also good at medical drawing. She is very gentle and refined. When she talks normally, it's like a light poem or a rhythmic tune—jumping around in your ears.

### Bu Wancang, Zhu Shilin, and Others Recommend the Success of "Twin Lotus"

— Yuntian

Tu Guangqi Has Signed a Directing Contract with China United

Yesterday, I watched the premiere of China United's "Twin Lotus" in Shanghai, and it left me feeling very satisfied. Whether from a technical or artistic standpoint, the beauty of the photography, the clarity of the recording, the smooth development of the entire plot, the control of each climax, and even the careful handling of each shot, all deserve to be called perfect.

Gu Yelu, who plays Zhonglian, is proposing to Lianfang (played by Shang Jun) at this moment, but outside the window hides Lianfang's gang leader from three years ago, forcing Lianfang to continue committing crimes, to steal a priceless twin lotus from her master's house; the clock on the dressing table points to 8:57, and he gives Lianfang until 9:00 to agree to his request, otherwise he will threaten to kill her lover, Zhonglian; she does not admit that Zhonglian is her lover, and harshly tells Zhonglian to leave her bedroom immediately, but Zhonglian doesn't realize the danger he is in, he is puzzled by Lianfang's sudden change, and he still playfully asks Lianfang to agree to his request, but at this time, there is another commanding request outside the window demanding her answer! Time is merciless, and the clock finally strikes: one, two, three, four... the pistol is aimed more accurately, so Lianfang shouts almost madly: I agree, I agree! The pitiful Zhonglian still thinks she has finally agreed to his proposal, he hugs Lianfang, unable to express his happiness; as for Lianfang? Half surprised and half delighted, she only takes a deep breath when the pistol outside the window is removed – but I think the intention of this advertisement is, sorry to say, not very pure. I find it hard to believe that this film was directed by a newcomer in his twenties; but it clearly writes in large letters "Director Tu Guangqi". I went to visit Mr. Bu Wancang, and luckily, they were holding a small group meeting to prepare for the collective filming of the epic film "The Story of Love", Yang Xiaozhong, Zhang Shichuan, Li Pingqian, and Zhu Shilin were all present. Mr. Bu and I are old acquaintances, so without any formalities, I said that I had just watched "Twin Lotus" at Hu Guang and found it extremely satisfying. What do you think of it? Can I hear your critique? He nodded and smiled. You don't need to ask me for a critique of this film, I'll just tell you a public secret: China United Company has signed a basic directing contract with Mr. Tu Guangqi, and the signing took place recently after watching the test screening of "Twin Lotus"; we just mentioned him in the meeting, and Zhang Shichuan was the first to say, "Truly, the younger generation is to be feared!" All the directors present unanimously recognized that this is a work worth recommending.

### New Voices in the Art World

— Yiqing

Lu Ming's Art and Drama Society will perform "The Young Mistress's Fan" at the Lyceum Theatre. In addition to herself playing Miss Jin, Chen Lu will play the Young Mistress Xu. They once invited Mei Xi to play Xu Ziming, but negotiations broke down. Rumors that "The Young Mistress's Fan" was a special invitation by Mei Xi for Lu Luming to star are completely inaccurate. However, the director of "The Young Mistress's Fan" is Mei Xi's brother, Mei Qian, and the cast is mostly from the Unnamed Drama Troupe.

Sun Jinglu is from the "China Travel Service." A gentleman never forgets his roots. Now, Sun Jinglu's activities outside still prominently display Tang Huaiqiu's banner. Therefore, after Tang Ruoqing's departure from Shanghai to North China this time, Tang Huaiqiu is not giving up his Shanghai territory and will still ask Sun Jinglu to maintain the Shanghai "China Travel Service." Also, Tang Ruoqing's first destination on this trip from Shanghai is Tianjin, partly to explore new routes and partly to visit a "friend" who recently arrived in Tianjin, serving both purposes.

The Yan Society Drama Troupe originally planned to give a public performance on September 4th to raise educational loans, but due to venue issues, it was changed to 2:30 pm on the 11th at the Palace Theatre, performing four plays: "The Lie of Love," "Tragedy on the Lake," "Between a Rock and a Hard Place," and "Tears of a Dancer." It is said that the troupe is organized by young students who have been studying stage art for years, and this performance is sure to be a grand occasion.

### Wang Yurong's Eagerness to Learn

— Xinye

Everyone knows that Wang Yurong is Wang Yaoqing's prized student. Among the female performers, she is relatively new, but her understanding of the Wang School's art is unmatched, and that's a fact.

It's not difficult for a female performer to become a disciple of Wang Yaoqing, but it's not easy to have Yaoqing personally teach a play. Because Yaoqing's play instruction is mostly done by Cheng Yuqing or his daughter Tieying. He himself doesn't like talking to people until after 3:00 a.m. Wang Yurong knew her teacher's temperament, so she didn't mind the hard work and rushed to Wang's residence every night after her performance, waiting until Yaoqing was in good spirits to approach him and ask for a few words. Over time, wasn't a play completed? Moreover, Yurong served her teacher so thoughtfully and got along so well with Tieying, so the plays "Yanmen Pass" and "The Fortune Mirror" are indeed completely authentic versions of Yaoqing's, and even the singing styles have a lineage.

### Sharing the Same Boat Through Storms

— Hejia Zhi

(8) What Can Be Done?

Qunzhen stood up and said, "Master Wei, if you pity me, please stop saying these things. Even if the Ye family isn't my home, please send me back to the Ye family; if you don't send me, just let me out the door, and I know how to get back to the Ye family myself." Wei Yunqing saw Cuizhen stand up, so he moved the stool back a bit and looked Cuizhen up and down, laughing, "Who's stopping you from going to the Ye family? In the New Year, I'll have some clothes made for you, if you don't look presentable, people will laugh at you. It doesn't matter to me, people know I have money, so it doesn't matter if I wear torn and old clothes. But you can't do that. We're not talking about fox or gray squirrel fur, but at least you should wear a sheepskin coat. With your figure, if you don't wear a qipao, a short jacket will do. I'll rummage through the bottom of my trunk, I can always find more than a dozen sheepskin coats, I'll find some fabric to match, and you'll have a new outfit, a new person, and you can go to the Ye family for the New Year to meet your new relatives, how great would that be? That's why I say you don't need to buy a bedpan and rush to the Ye family before it gets dark. You're a smart girl, you should understand." Cuizhen heard Wei Yunqing's words becoming more and more inappropriate, so she stiffened her face and said, "Master Wei, what are you saying? If you don't let me out, call my uncle Fei Changhe out, I have something to say to him."

That Cao Mama is probably a busybody, and chimed in saying, "Master, do you want me to find Fei Changhe for Miss Bian? I saw him going back and forth this morning, but now he's probably gone to the gambling den, but I can have Asi and the others look for him." Wei Yunqing was truly fickle, he was always smiling when talking to Qunzhen, but as soon as Long Cao Mama spoke, he suddenly slammed the table hard, splashing the red bean soup all over the table, and a few drops even landed on Cuizhen's clothes. He shouted, "You're talking nonsense, who told you to find Fei Changhe? Get away from me!" After scolding Cao Mama like that, he changed his expression and said to Cuizhen with a pleasant face, "Fei Changhe is a straightforward person, but he likes to gamble. When he gambles, he gambles fiercely when he has a lot of money, and he gambles a little better when he has less money. This time, I don't know what demon possessed him, or maybe his ancestors underground have lost their spirit, he didn't have any money, but he became reckless, and he lost five thousand dollars in one gamble, selling the house isn't enough to cover it, selling the land isn't enough to cover it, even selling his wife and daughters isn't enough to cover it. Miss Cuizhen, what do you think he can do?" (176)
