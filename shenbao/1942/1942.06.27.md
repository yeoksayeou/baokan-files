The port has been reduced to rubble under the bombardment, its outer defense lines have been destroyed, and its inner fortress lines are now in imminent danger. The German army on the Kharkov front also launched an offensive, and the fighting has intensified again. Concentrated attacks by German tanks have shaken the Soviet front lines, forcing them to retreat from Kupyansk, about 60 miles southeast of Kharkov. Today's Soviet supplementary communiqué also stated that fierce air battles are currently underway, especially in the Kharkov area. There is still no news about the Soviet army landing in southern Crimea in an attempt to reinforce Sevastopol port. According to news from the Swedish capital, a Soviet convoy has sailed from the Caucasus port, carrying troops to land in Crimea. The German army has also rushed troops from Simferopol and Feodosia to reinforce, and they are currently engaged in battle in the Karai Mountains.

Havas News Agency, Moscow Dispatch, 25th: The Soviet official war report announced that the Soviet army has withdrawn from the city of Kupyansk, 50 miles southeast of Kharkov. On the Sevastopol port front, enemy forces have attacked our positions several times but have been repelled. There is nothing else of note on other fronts.

Havas News Agency, Berlin Dispatch, 25th: The German News Agency recently issued a message stating that although the fighting in various areas on the Eastern Front is becoming increasingly fierce, the large-scale summer offensive has not yet begun. Indeed, preparations for a general German offensive on the Eastern Front have long been completed. However, the current situation is completely different from the first few months of this year. In other words, the current preparatory work is based on a new operational plan drafted by the General Headquarters to straighten the entire front line. The recent battles in the Volkhov, Kharkov, and Sevastopol regions should be viewed from this perspective.

Havas News Agency dispatch from somewhere on the Ukrainian Front, 25th: There have been no changes on the Sevastopol port front in recent days. According to dispatches from the front, the Soviet army's situation is becoming increasingly critical, but it has continued to counterattack over the past 48 hours. According to military observers, the fate of the port is sealed, and it is difficult for the Soviet garrison, with its weak strength, to hold it for long. The gap broken through by the German-Romanian allied forces is very deep, and the weak Soviet defense force cannot reverse the situation. However, it is heard that yesterday the Soviet army launched a very strong offensive. The German-Romanian allied forces forcibly landed south of Bălteni-Vovka and Inkerman Bay, and the military operations were quite successful, having occupied several bridgeheads. However, after fierce Soviet counterattacks, they were finally forced to retreat. It is expected that the goal can be achieved within days. In addition, the German army's Manstein division is now attacking Sevastopol port, but if it cannot quickly widen the gap in the port's final defense line, the fighting in the port will still be prolonged for several days. According to military experts, Sevastopol port has been heavily damaged. The Soviet army's continued stubborn resistance is of no major military value. However, the Soviet command wants to delay the time to benefit the Red Army. The Soviet side has claimed that the battles of Kharkov, the Kerch Peninsula, and Sevastopol port have changed the German army's spring offensive plan, and the German army has decided to attack the port at any cost, precisely because of this. According to information, the strength of the German-Romanian allied forces on the port front is about twenty divisions.

### Japanese Army in the Philippines Increases Issuance of Military Peso Notes

Allied News Agency, Manila Dispatch, 26th: Previously, the American and Filipino forces in Visayas had issued temporary banknotes through the Philippine National Bank branch. This matter was an attempt by the American and Filipino forces to use this as military expenditure and to use it as a tool to disrupt the Philippine economy. Therefore, the Japanese army authorities in the Philippines issued a statement on May 7th, not recognizing its value and prohibiting its circulation. Until recently, because the public was able to clearly understand the meaning of the Japanese army's move, the circulation of this temporary banknote has gradually disappeared. However, the amount of banknotes issued was approximately 32.3 million pesos. After the prohibition of circulation, the local currency appeared to be insufficient. Therefore, the official peso currency issued by the former Philippine government has gradually been circulated again in the market. The Japanese army authorities have re-issued military peso notes worth 20 million in the funds for the restoration of Visayas. Therefore, the temporary financial turnover difficulties in the area have gradually eased.

Haitong News Agency, Berlin Dispatch, 26th: The German Foreign Ministry spokesman stated yesterday that the New York Times' article regarding Roosevelt and Churchill's differences of opinion on which battlefield should have priority in supply can somewhat confirm the danger of the British position in North Africa.

The Argentine government has demanded that Germany compensate for the insult to the Argentine flag, compensate for the Argentine personnel and material losses, and guarantee that similar incidents will not happen again. Although the note does not specify that the incident was a planned action by the German side, the submarine commander should still be held responsible.

### British Eighth Army Reorganized, Retreating to Mersa Matruh, German Forces Advance Along the Desert Railway, Imminent Armored Clash

Lisbon, 26th, Allied News Agency - Two days after Axis armored columns in North Africa broke through the Egyptian border defenses, they have now penetrated 100 miles into the Egyptian desert, launching a major offensive against Mersa Matruh, and planning to advance towards Alexandria. Axis forces are currently 30 miles from Mersa Matruh. The British Eighth Army is currently engaged in fierce fighting with the full strength of the Axis forces in the coastal lowlands and desert between Sidi Barrani and Mersa Matruh. The Cairo "Gazette" today acknowledged that the main German force is advancing along the desert railway, closing in on Mersa Matruh, but claimed that the main British force has not yet engaged.

Stockholm, 26th, Baltic News Agency - A London dispatch this afternoon stated that in the Egyptian battle, armored forces clashed and artillery bombardments took place southwest of Mersa Matruh starting last night. After reorganization, remnants of the British Eighth Army are again fighting against German and Italian forces at Mersa Matruh.

London, 25th, Havas News Agency - According to the latest reports, the enemy's vanguard has broken into Egyptian territory for 60 miles. Some enemy units are also advancing along the northern route of that line, reaching 45 miles east of Solum along the coast. The main German force in North Africa, after passing through the Egyptian border in the El Alamein area, is now en route to Sidi Barrani and Mersa Matruh. It has been observed that German armored units often cooperate with some of the rapid Italian units, and rather than bypass British minefields from the extreme south as generally expected, they prefer to break through the lines in the El Alamein area. British infantry have been ordered to retreat, while Central Allied armored units operating in the more southern areas have been ordered to begin obstructing the enemy's flanks. A major clash between armored forces has not yet occurred, but is imminent.

Stockholm, 26th, Baltic News Agency - Swedish newspapers report a London dispatch stating that the remaining units of the British Eighth Army, having retreated from the Egyptian border, have now established new defense lines at Mersa Matruh. It is said that the British retreat was intended to avoid being flanked or surrounded by Rommel's forces, so they retreated to Mersa Matruh, 132 miles from the Egyptian border. A Reuters military correspondent writes that Mersa Matruh has strong defensive works, making it well-suited for defense. If General Rommel intends to attack the area, he must first expand his transportation routes, and the Axis forces must conquer the waterless desert before taking any action against the area. Mersa Matruh is only 156 miles from the British naval base in Alexandria.

Berlin, 26th, Baltic News Agency - The German High Command announced in its supplemental war report last night that after breaking through the British defenses along the Libyan-Egyptian border, Axis forces are closely pursuing the routed enemy. They have now crossed the Egyptian border and continue to advance, occupying the Qabu Sulaiman fortress and the Halfaya Pass. The enemy abandoned many tanks along the way. Sollum has also been occupied by Axis forces, causing significant losses to the British. The Axis forces are continuing to advance, pursuing the remnants of the defeated enemy. The German Air Force is also conducting sorties to bomb the retreating British forces.

Berlin, 26th, Baltic News Agency - The German military announced in a supplemental war report yesterday that the capture of Sollum, Halfaya, and Sidi Barrani demonstrates the great determination of the Axis forces. The enemy forces in the Egyptian border battles are purely Indian troops, indicating that the British command continues to prioritize sacrificing colonial troops, and showing that the British have few reserves to deploy. Axis aircraft can now attack the Egyptian supply port of Alexandria from newly occupied airfields, which is only about 500 kilometers from the Egyptian border.

Berlin, 26th, Baltic News Agency - German authorities announced last night that Indian troops put up a heroic resistance in the battle for the Halfaya Pass south of Sollum in order to cover the rapid retreat of the main British forces.

Berlin, 28th, Baltic News Agency - The German and Italian forces operating in North Africa continue to advance eastward. British reports indicate that major battles are underway southwest of Mersa Matruh. Indeed, the German and Italian forces have penetrated 132 miles into Egypt. However, Berlin authorities claim that no official statement can be made regarding this news at this time. It seems that the British intend to fight a battle at Mersa Matruh.

Berlin, 26th, Baltic News Agency - The German Air Force continued to pursue the retreating enemy in North Africa yesterday. The British built new positions east of Mersa Matruh, which were attacked by German aircraft in low-level strikes. Warehouses were destroyed by large bombs, causing several large fires.

Istanbul, 26th, Baltic News Agency - According to official Cairo statements, Major General Klopper, commander of the South African 2nd Division, was captured during the fall of Tobruk.

### Churchill to Relinquish Position as Minister of Defence, Cripps Declares to the House of Commons that the Prime Minister Will Return Home to Debate the War Situation

Stockholm, 26th, Baltic News Agency

London dispatch: Sir Stafford Cripps, a British cabinet minister, declared to the House of Commons last night that Prime Minister Churchill will return to London in time to participate in the debate on the Libyan campaign.

Bern, 25th, Havas News Agency - Correspondents in London report that Prime Minister Churchill may be forced to relinquish his concurrent position as Minister of Defence, but he will likely still receive a majority of confidence votes in the House of Commons this time, although the margin will be less than before. A correspondent for the Basler Nachrichten reports that it is undeniable that Churchill's prestige has declined. No one in London is advocating for reducing the Prime Minister's powers; he is being criticized solely for selecting irresponsible cabinet members. A correspondent for the National Gazette reports that the general public in Britain believes that not only the military apparatus but also the parliamentary system needs to be thoroughly reorganized. The Daily Telegraph of Britain is vehemently attacking the High Command, emphasizing the poor equipment of the Libyan combat forces. As for the Labour Party, it is hoped that they will continue to support the Prime Minister, but Labour leaders insist that the Prime Minister needs to return home from America immediately. Meanwhile, some members of the House of Commons have proposed amendments to the opposition's motion of no confidence, including the following: 1. The House of Commons expresses its firm confidence in the Prime Minister and his war strategy, and even guarantees unanimous support from the entire House so that the government can implement all measures it deems necessary to expand the war effort.

Madrid, 26th, Baltic News Agency - According to a "Juvenile Gazette" correspondent in London, Asier, British people believe that Churchill may resign from his concurrent position as Minister of Defence due to the defeat of British forces in North Africa. Speculation about the candidates for Minister of Defence is strongest for General Wavell. Most political observers believe that Churchill will not resign as Prime Minister because of his close relationship with President Roosevelt, which enables Britain and the United States to jointly confront the Tripartite Pact countries and gain the trust of all parts of the British Empire. Even with the tragedies of Dunkirk, Greece, and Singapore, his position has not been shaken. London military and political figures praise his political skills in conducting negotiations. He recently signed the Anglo-Soviet agreement.

Stockholm, 26th, Baltic News Agency - Churchill's followers are working hard to alleviate the tense atmosphere following the fall of Tobruk, which has been quite effective. Rumors say that Churchill has secretly returned to Britain, but this has not been confirmed. Well-informed sources in London state that Churchill has spoken to his close aides by telephone, declaring that he will assume all responsibility. It is claimed that he will defend himself and the Cabinet and make more candid statements. However, political figures in London anticipate that if more members of the House of Commons express their support for the motion of no confidence, then the rumor of Churchill's resignation is the use of political pressure. Nevertheless, candidates for the new Prime Minister are already being discussed. Milne, Lord Winterton, and Beasley all hope to succeed the Prime Minister. Beasley considers himself "Disraeli the Second" and dreams of becoming Prime Minister day and night.

Ankara, 26th, Baltic News Agency - The Turkish public is paying close attention to the Axis forces' occupation of Fort Capuzzo, Halfaya Pass, and Sollum, as well as their entry into Egypt and the breakthrough at Sidi Barrani. Turkish military circles regard the collapse of the British Eighth Army as an "alarming phenomenon." It is generally believed that Egyptian Prime Minister Nahas's speech at a meeting on Wednesday afternoon served to stabilize morale. Diplomatic circles here received news several days ago that the British were prepared to take over Egypt's legislative and administrative powers and occupy key positions.

Istanbul, 26th, Baltic News Agency - Egyptian Prime Minister Nahas met with several political figures yesterday, promising to keep them informed of the latest news from the western border.

### British Aircraft Attack Northwestern Germany, Losing 53 Aircraft

This is the heaviest loss suffered by British bombers on a raid since the recent attack on Cologne, when the Germans shot down 44 aircraft.

### Western Missionaries in the Imperial Astronomical Bureau

— Xu Zongze

The Imperial Astronomical Bureau is in charge of astronomy, calendrical calculations, divination, and astronomical computation. During the early years of the Tang Dynasty's Qian Yuan era, the Bureau of the Grand Historian was renamed the Bureau of Astronomy. In the Song Dynasty, it was called the Bureau of the Grand Observatory. In the Ming and Qing dynasties, it was known as the Imperial Astronomical Bureau. The establishment of the Imperial Astronomical Bureau dates back to the 13th century. Although the Qing Dynasty's Imperial Astronomical Bureau was subordinate to the Ministry of Rites, it was not subject to its control. It had a director-general, a minister in charge of the Imperial Astronomical Bureau's affairs, usually a prince, who was solely responsible for ceremonial matters and had no other duties. In addition to the director-general, there were two directors, one Manchu and one Han, and two deputy directors, also one Manchu and one Han, and two assistant deputy directors. Below them were the five officials of the Four Seasons and an astronomical staff of about two hundred. Missionaries in the Imperial Astronomical Bureau only held the positions of Han Director and Deputy Director, while the Manchu Director and Deputy Director's affairs remained as before.

The involvement of missionaries in calendar reform can be traced back to Matteo Ricci. Ricci entered Beijing in 1600 and immediately focused on astronomy. Among his writings were "The Meaning of Heaven and Earth," a book discussing celestial phenomena and calendrical calculations, and "Jing Tian Gai," which compiled the then-known Western constellations into mnemonic verses for easy observation. He also created instruments such as armillary spheres, celestial globes, and terrestrial globes. Xu Guangqi, Li Zhizao, and Zhou Ziyu followed him, learning his skills. Unfortunately, our country's astronomical officials adhered to the old ways and ultimately made small reforms. Ricci died in Beijing in 1610.

In the year Ricci passed away, there was a solar eclipse on the first day of the eleventh month. The Imperial Astronomical Bureau's calculations proved inaccurate, while the predictions of the Western scholar Diego de Pantoja were precisely correct. Xu Guangqi urged the Ministry of Rites to petition for Pantoja and Sabatino de Ursis to jointly translate Western astronomical methods. The public sentiment was to seek an imperial edict to allow missionaries to remain in Beijing. Unfortunately, the petition was submitted but not approved.

In the forty-first year of the Wanli reign (1613), Li Zhizao petitioned, requesting that the Western tribute envoys Pantoja, de Ursis, Long Huamin, and Yang Manuo establish a bureau to verify books. At that time, official matters were handled inefficiently, and the plan could not be implemented.

In the second year of the Chongzhen reign (1629), there was a solar eclipse on the first day of May. The Imperial Astronomical Bureau's calculations of both the time and duration were incorrect. Xu Guangqi's calculations of the solar eclipse were accurate. On the thirteenth day of September, the emperor issued an edict for Guangqi to reform the calendar. Guangqi immediately established a calendar bureau and translated astronomical books. Long Huamin and Johann Adam Schall von Bell assisted in the calendar reform. Deng Yu Han passed away in 163*. On the eleventh day of May, Guangqi recommended Johann Terrenz and Giacomo Rho to replace him, instructing them in instrument making and calculation methods.

After Xu Guangqi established the bureau to reform the calendar, he believed that "if a craftsman wants to do his job well, he must first sharpen his tools." Therefore, his primary task was to translate astronomical books. From the second year of the Chongzhen reign to the year of his death (the seventh day of the tenth month of the sixth year of Chongzhen), he presented astronomical books three times, totaling fifteen volumes. There were also sixty volumes of new astronomical books awaiting presentation, of which thirty volumes had been personally revised by Xu Guangqi, while the other thirty volumes were drafts. These drafts were presented by Johann Adam Schall von Bell the year after Xu Guangqi's death, totaling twenty-nine volumes, along with a star chart. He also presented thirty-two volumes of astronomical computations. The above books were compiled into one hundred volumes and named "Chongzhen Astronomical Book."

Before his death, Xu Guangqi recommended Li Tianjing to succeed him and also petitioned for rewards for the Western scholars. After Li Tianjing took office, he also requested rewards for the Western scholars. In the eleventh year of Chongzhen, the emperor issued an edict praising them and personally inscribed a plaque that read: "Reverently Praising Heavenly Learning," which was bestowed upon Schall von Bell to respectfully hang in the church. In the fourteenth year, the emperor, recognizing the achievements of the Western scholars Long Huamin, Deng Yu Han, Luo Yagu, and Tang Ruowang in reforming the calendar, instructed the Ministry of Personnel to discuss granting them official ranks. The scholars firmly declined, requesting that the order be withdrawn. The emperor agreed, promoting and praising heavenly learning according to ritual. The Ministry of Rites issued an edict to distribute copies of the imperial inscription "Reverently Praising Heavenly Learning" to various provinces for officials to receive and hang in the Catholic churches.

The Western scholars at the end of the Ming Dynasty worked hard to reform the calendar but ultimately failed to achieve their goals due to the obstruction of conservative factions. However, their efforts over more than a decade, producing various astronomical instruments and translating numerous astronomical texts, cannot be denied.

With Xu Guangqi's death, the Manchus entered the Central Plains. After Prince Regent Dorgon occupied Beijing, he immediately ordered all Han Chinese to move out of the capital within three days to be replaced by Manchus. Upon hearing this news, Johann Adam Schall von Bell immediately submitted a memorial to the prince, stating that the accumulated astronomical books and instruments were numerous and difficult to move, and that moving them would inevitably cause damage. His memorial was approved, and he was allowed to remain as before. In the first year of the Shunzhi reign (1644), Johann Adam Schall von Bell presented the New Method Calendar. Soon after, the prince regent issued an edict, stating that the Western New Method was precise in its calculations and should be adopted. During the solar eclipse on the first day of August, Schall von Bell went to the observatory to verify the calculations. The verification showed that the Western New Method closely matched the celestial movements, while the Shangtong calendar and the Hui calendar were inaccurate. Therefore, the Western method was adopted. In the third year (1646), Emperor Shunzhi appointed Schall von Bell as the Director of the Imperial Astronomical Bureau, later adding the title of Vice Minister of the Court of Imperial Sacrifices. In the eighth year, when the emperor began to rule in his own name, he bestowed upon Schall von Bell the title of Grand Master for Thorough Discussion. In the tenth year, the emperor bestowed the title of "Master of Profound Understanding." The emperor's favor can be said to have reached its peak. However, not long after, the opposing faction, led by Yang Guangxian, initiated a calendar persecution, and a great disaster occurred.

Yang Guangxian was from She County, Anhui. Due to the long-standing tradition of appointing Hui people to the Imperial Astronomical Bureau, Yang Guangxian felt aggrieved that Tang Ruowang was appointed to the Imperial Astronomical Bureau using the Western New Method, displacing the Hui people. He sought ways to undermine him. In the seventeenth year of Shunzhi reign (1660), he accused Tang Ruowang, claiming that the "Shixian Calendar" he created should not have had the words "According to the Western New Method" stamped on it, stating that "these five words secretly usurp the power of the Zhengshuo and give it to the West, clearly stating that the Great Qing follows the Western Zhengshuo," and so on. On the third day of the twelfth month of the seventeenth year of Shunzhi, he submitted his accusation to the Ministry of Rites, but it was not approved.

In the third year of the Kangxi reign, Yang Guangxian again submitted a memorial accusing Tang Ruowang and the Western scholars of three major crimes: plotting rebellion, spreading heretical doctrines, and using an inaccurate calendar. In August, Ruowang was interrogated. At that time, Ruowang was already seventy-three years old and suddenly suffered from paralysis, his tongue tied. Ferdinand Verbiest stood by his side, answering on his behalf. On the first day of the third month of the fourth year, the Ministry of Rites and the Ministry of Justice jointly proposed that Tang Ruowang be sentenced to death, and the other missionaries be flogged and exiled. The two assistant ministers were about to approve the proposal when a sudden earthquake occurred, with five consecutive tremors over several days, causing widespread panic. The assistant ministers used the prison as a warning. The Empress Dowager (Emperor Shunzhi's mother) declared that Heaven's warning was to be feared, and ordered the case to be reopened. After Ruowang was pardoned, he passed away peacefully the following year (August 15, 1666). Subsequently, the advancement of affairs was led by Ferdinand Verbiest.

Verbiest was a Belgian, born in 1623. At the age of eighteen, he joined the Society of Jesus. In 165*, he came to China. In 1659, he was sent to Shaanxi to preach. On May 9, 1660, he was summoned to Beijing to assist Tang Ruowang in reforming the calendar. Four years later, the Yang Guangxian incident occurred. The Western scholars in the Imperial Astronomical Bureau were falsely accused and dismissed. After Yang Guangxian and Wu Mingdeng obtained the positions of Director and Deputy Director, they first abolished the Western method and restored the old method. Then, finding the old method inaccurate, they used the Hui method, making revisions and alterations, forcing Heaven to follow man, resulting in numerous errors. The calendar they issued did not match the celestial movements. Fortunately, Emperor Kangxi was enlightened and saw through the deceit of Yang and Wu. After he began to rule in his own name, he resolutely decided to adopt the Western method. In February of the seventh year, the emperor ordered ministers to summon Ferdinand Verbiest and the astronomical officials for questioning. The following year, the ministers went to the astronomical observatory to conduct verifications. Verbiest accurately predicted the values, while Wu Mingxuan's claims were proven false. Yang and Wu then claimed that they did not know how to calculate, and were reprimanded by the emperor. In the eighth year of Kangxi, Ferdinand Verbiest was appointed as the Deputy Director of the Imperial Astronomical Bureau. On March 30 of the thirteenth year (1678), Ferdinand Verbiest was praised for his diligence in manufacturing instruments and was granted the title of Vice Minister of the Court of Imperial Sacrifices and appointed as the Director of the Imperial Astronomical Bureau.

On December 28 of the twenty-sixth year of Kangxi (1688), Ferdinand Verbiest passed away. The vacant position of Director of the Imperial Astronomical Bureau was not filled. Instead, Min Mingwo was asked to practice calendrical methods and was appointed to replace Verbiest in managing the calendar. Min Mingwo is currently on a military mission abroad (sent as an envoy to Russia). If there are matters that need to be handled, consult with Xu Risheng and An Duo.

In the fifty-fifth year of Kangxi (1716), Dai Jinxian was summoned to Beijing to assist in calendrical affairs. In the third year of Yongzheng, he was appointed as the Director of the Imperial Astronomical Bureau, with the added title of Vice Minister of the Ministry of Rites. Dai's greatest contribution was revising Ferdinand Verbiest's "Lingtai Yixiang Zhi" (completed in the ninth year of Qianlong), based on newly measured Western stellar coordinates, with repeated verifications, as Verbiest's "Yixiang Zhi" still had many inaccuracies. Furthermore, the "Lixiang Kaocheng Houbian," completed in the seventh year of Qianlong, supplemented the deficiencies of the "Lixiang Kaocheng" compiled during the Kangxi era. The book compiled during the Kangxi era still used Tycho Brahe's old calculations, while the "Kaocheng Houbian" adopted the new methods of Copernicus and Newton.

In the eleventh year of Qianlong (1746), Dai Jinxian passed away. Dai worked in the Imperial Astronomical Bureau for a total of twenty-nine years. Deputy Director Liu Songling was appointed as the Director of the Imperial Astronomical Bureau, and Bao Youguan became the Deputy Director. In the thirty-ninth year (1774), Liu passed away, and Chuan Zuolin was appointed as the Director. In that year, Emperor Qianlong sent Bian Gong to Jinchuan to conduct surveying and mapping. Bian left Beijing on August 20 of that year and later returned. Three years later, in March 1777, he was again ordered to go. During this period, An Guoning was appointed as the Director of the Imperial Astronomical Bureau in the fortieth year of Qianlong (1775) and later became the Director (Zheng Jiao Feng Bao, page 142). In 1781, Chuan Zuolin passed away, and Gao Shensi succeeded him as the Director, with Suo Chaobo appointed as the Deputy Director. The Society of Jesus in China was abolished by order of the Roman Pope in 1775. Therefore, the missionary affairs of the Society of Jesus in Beijing were taken over by the Vincentians. Subsequently, the duties of the Imperial Astronomical Bureau were also filled by the Vincentians. During the Jiaqing and Daoguang reigns, Fu Wengao, Li Gongchen, Bi Xueyuan, and Gao Shouqian served as Directors of the Imperial Astronomical Bureau. By the sixth year of Daoguang, there were no longer any Westerners serving in the Imperial Astronomical Bureau. The circumstances of its termination were as follows. The missionaries in Beijing during the early years of Daoguang were Vincentians. At that time, Bishop Bi Xueyuan and Li Gongchen resided in the South Church, while Gao Shouqian and Fu Wengao, as well as the Chinese priest Xue Gong, resided in the North Church. In the sixth year of Daoguang, Gao Shouqian was appointed as the Director of the Imperial Astronomical Bureau. Gao requested that Emperor Daoguang allow him to return to Europe to care for his elderly mother. Gao's intention was that the Imperial Astronomical Bureau still needed Westerners to manage the calendar, and Daoguang would recruit Vincentians from Macau to replace him. Unexpectedly, Daoguang granted his request to return to his country but did not recruit Westerners who knew about the calendar from Macau, and thus there were no Westerners managing the calendar in the Imperial Astronomical Bureau. At that time, Fu Wengao had already passed away on February 1, 1824. Li Gongchen also passed away on October 24 of the year Gao returned to Europe. Priest Xue left Beijing in 1828. Only Bishop Bi Xueyuan remained. Bishop Bi passed away in Beijing on November 2, 1838, and there were no Western missionaries in Beijing for a time. From Matteo Ricci's arrival in Beijing in 1600 to 1883, missionaries resided in Beijing for 238 years. From Xu Guangqi's establishment of the calendar bureau in the second year of Chongzhen (1629) to Gao Shouqian's departure in the sixth year of Daoguang (1826), missionaries managed the calendar in the Imperial Astronomical Bureau for 197 years.

Looking back, Ricci's arrival in Beijing and his ability to reside there initially lacked the formal permission of the Ming court. It was only due to the emperor's favor and the friendship of officials and gentry. Therefore, such a situation was ultimately unsustainable. Xu Guangqi was acutely aware of this and eagerly sought to establish a solid position for the missionaries. As the Ming court needed people to manage the calendar, he seized the opportunity to recommend Western scholars to enter the Imperial Astronomical Bureau. As a result, missionaries were able to reside in Beijing and preach in the interior. Although religious persecution rose and fell at times, the missionaries persevered and never disappeared from China. This was truly the achievement of Western missionaries managing the calendar.

### Rental Issues After Currency Change - Authorities Studying Fair Solutions - Regulations Expected Soon, Hopefully Applying to Subtenants

The Shanghai Times reports that regulations regarding how to calculate rent after the change from old legal tender to Central Reserve Bank notes are expected to be announced soon by the authorities. It is reported that officials from the Shanghai Municipal Council and the Japanese Consulate General are currently discussing this important and complex issue, studying all aspects in order to arrive at a decision that is fair to both landlords and tenants. While this matter superficially involves landlords and secondary tenants, the most affected are the tens of thousands of subtenants in this city. A Municipal Council official said, "The authorities are fully aware that the rent issue has a significant impact on all residents." It is reported that one major real estate company has converted all rents from old legal tender to Central Reserve Bank notes at a rate of 66 percent. Another real estate company is converting rents at a rate of 70 percent. A certain French company insists that rent must be collected in Central Reserve Bank notes at the original old legal tender amount, otherwise, the tenant must move out. Many other real estate companies insist that rent must be collected in Central Reserve Bank notes at the original rental amount, otherwise, they instruct tenants to wait for the authorities to issue a formal announcement on this important issue. The general public hopes that officials will soon issue an announcement on the rent issue, so as to eliminate the existing disputes and resentment between landlords and tenants. It is further hoped that the authorities will state in the announcement that the regulations for paying rent should not only apply between landlords and secondary tenants, but also between secondary tenants and subtenants, in order to prevent abuses.

### Suspending Imported Rice Next Thursday - Limited Rice Sales on July 3rd - Rice Dealers to Register Household Rice by Month's End

Rationing by head count in the two concessions has been set to begin on the sixth of next month. The issuance of rice purchase certificates, which began on the 22nd, continues to be distributed. It is scheduled to be completed by July 4th. Tomorrow is Sunday, and the issuance of certificates will be suspended for one day. The details are as follows:

Suspending Imported Rice Next Thursday

According to a Datong News Agency reporter, public concession rice dealers must dispose of broken rice on July 2nd (Thursday). Due to preparations for the implementation of rice rationing, the Rice and Grain Management Committee has notified all rice dealers to temporarily suspend sales. Therefore, rice dealers do not need to collect sales orders from the Rice and Grain Office on Monday, June 29th. The broken rice sold by rice dealers on June 30th is the last retail sale of rice before the implementation of head-count rice rationing.

Limited Sale of Corn Rice on July 3rd

Although rice dealers will suspend the sale of broken rice on July 2nd, they will switch to selling broken corn rice for one day on July 3rd (Friday). Each liter will be sold for 2.20 Central Reserve Bank dollars, with a limit of 1.5 liters per person. This corn rice has been entrusted to Lihe & Co. for milling by the Rice and Grain Office. Rice dealers must pay for and take delivery of the goods on June 29th. The purchase price is 198.30 Central Reserve Bank dollars per bag, weighing 204 pounds.

Rice Dealers to Register Household Rice by Month's End

On June 30th, the 659 rice dealers who have a retail contract with the Two Concessions and the Municipal Council Rice and Grain Management Committee will pay the Rice and Grain Office for the first time to collect the imported rice for head-count rice rationing. The maximum for each rice dealer is 200 bags, and the minimum is 30 bags. The amount depends on the population density in the surrounding area. Each rice dealer will complete the rice collection by Monday, July 6th. The Rice and Grain Office will issue rice based on the rice dealer's receipt. Head-count rice rationing will officially be realized at this point.

French Concession Also Starts Simultaneously

Officials from the French Concession Rice and Grain Management Office said that the measures for head-count rice rationing in the French Concession are the same as those in the Public Concession, that is, the issuance of July rice purchase certificates is scheduled to end on July *. Rice collection is scheduled to begin on July 6th. The quantity and price have not yet been announced.

### Authorities Strictly Crack Down on Speculation and Black Markets - Trading Stopped - Gold Thread, Cotton Yarn, and Other Markets Have Been Dissolved - Prices of Various Daily Necessities Have Also Fallen

The various speculative exchanges and black markets in this city have been shut down one after another due to the joint prohibition measures taken by the authorities. It is reported that the Exchange Market on Central Road, the spot cotton yarn factory order market in Tonghe Lane on Ningbo Road, and the cotton cloth exchange on Avenue Edward VII have completely stopped illegal black market trading and have announced their dissolution. In addition, the authorities have strictly prohibited speculative factors in cotton cloth trading. The trading of Chinese and foreign stocks and foreign currencies, such as US dollars and British pounds, has also disappeared or completely stopped. The trading of Japanese military scrip has been subject to a licensing system issued by the Daily Affairs Bureau, stipulating that more than 100 money shops operate under the supervision of the relevant authorities. As for various daily necessities such as soap and matches, prices continue to fall due to the anti-speculation campaign. The market price of cigarettes is also weak. The standing committees of the two concessions issued a notice on *th that all persons or legal entities under Chinese law who buy or sell or speculate in goods, securities, warehouse receipts, or bills of lading without the approval of the Chinese authorities will be subject to a fine of 10,000 yuan or imprisonment upon verification. Therefore, most merchants have begun to avoid speculation as a dangerous path, so commodity prices are expected to continue to decline, and people's livelihood can also be more stable.

### Shanghai Municipal Council Strictly Compiling Vegetable Market Prices - Investigating Prices to Strictly Crack Down on Profiteering - Smoothing Sources of Supply - Japanese Side Agrees to Cooperate

The Shanghai Times reports that Municipal Council officials are currently thoroughly investigating the prices of vegetables, meat, poultry, and other foods in various vegetable markets in the Public Concession. Based on the results of the investigation, the Municipal Council is expected to take action on vegetable market prices in the shortest possible time. It is reported that the authorities of the Bureau are currently planning to maintain strict control over vegetable prices, just as the Bureau has implemented price controls on retail stores.

Strict Control of Vegetable Market Prices

Yesterday (the 25th), an official from the Municipal Council stated that controlling food prices is not as simple as controlling retail store prices. The most important aspect regarding vegetable market prices is the perishability of the goods. Therefore, vendors of perishable goods must be given reasonable compensation. Another key point is the issue of supply and demand. In April, all kinds of meat were scarce, but in May, the number of livestock slaughtered at various slaughterhouses increased by about one-quarter, and the shortage of meat was greatly alleviated. Now that Municipal Council officials are preparing to strictly control vegetable market prices, they must first obtain detailed reports on the production locations of vegetables and poultry and the transportation costs to Shanghai. The Japanese authorities are also cooperating to smooth the supply of goods from the surrounding countryside to Shanghai.

Thorough Investigation and Crackdown on Profiteering

The Bureau's inspectors are also conducting a thorough investigation of the costs of transporting poultry to the slaughterhouses, as well as slaughter fees and municipal taxes. The prices of meat in various vegetable markets will then be controlled based on this. It is reported that the health and food inspectors have been investigating the issue of vegetable market prices for some time. According to the investigation, vegetable market prices after the conversion from old legal tender to Central Reserve Bank notes were initially still low, but not as much as the 50% reduction announced by the Shanghai Municipal Council Price Control Committee. Recently, they have risen again, almost equal to the old legal tender prices at the end of May. The municipal authorities hope to complete the investigation of vegetable prices within a few days, and then launch a campaign to crack down on profiteering. At that time, the public will be asked to cooperate.

### French Concession Re-issuing Curfew Permits

The 1941 curfew permits issued by the French Concession Police, which were renewed for the first half of 1942, will expire on June 30, 1942. Holders of these permits may renew their permits between June 25 and August 10 in the evening, exchanging white permits for red permits, and orange-yellow permits for blue permits. Applicants should submit their old permits and two photographs and pay a fee of 5 Central Reserve Bank dollars. Curfew permits that are not renewed by August 15 will be invalid.

### French Concession Police Strictly Prohibit the Sale of Broken Rice

The French Concession authorities are currently organizing head-count rice rationing. To complete this plan as soon as possible, more than 30 small rice shops in the Xujiahui area that specialized in selling broken rice were ordered to close down some time ago. However, after these rice shops closed down, street vendors specializing in selling broken rice continued to come and go incessantly. The French Concession Police have sent detectives to secretly investigate and crack down in the Xujiahui area. It is reported that several rice vendors have been arrested in the past few days. Considering that they were first-time offenders, they were given a warning and released.

### Fire in Fa-Hua-Zhen

Yesterday morning at 4:40, a sudden fire broke out at No. 17, Juchang Hardware Store, in Fa-Hua-Zhen in West Shanghai. For a time, the flames soared, bursting through the roof. The Fire Brigade was informed and drove to the scene to put out the fire, which was extinguished at about 5:00. In addition to the complete destruction of the hardware store, the fire also spread to the factory buildings of Taihe Textile Factory at No. 10 and No. 18 next door, as well as several bungalows, causing great damage.

### Old Woman Crushed to Death

An old woman from Pudong, Yang Gu, 56 years old, residing at No. 87, Lane 26, Lu Shan Road, went out at 3:30 pm on the afternoon of the *th. While passing through Lane 41 of Route Tenant de Tourville, the wall of the Public Works Department's No. 1 warehouse suddenly collapsed. Ms. Yang was unable to avoid it and was crushed. The police sent her to the hospital, but she died before she could be treated. The body was taken to the morgue. The body was claimed from the morgue yesterday for funeral arrangements.

### Between Japan and the United States, Ships for Repatriation of Nationals; All Countries Assure Non-Aggression; Exchange of 1,500 People Each, Carried on Three Special Vessels to East Africa

The most complex and volatile stage of the American repatriation process has passed. Approximately 1,500 American officials in China and Japan will be transported to Magers, Africa, on two special vessels respectively. They will be exchanged for the same number of Japanese officials and civilians evacuated from the United States and South America and gathered there. Among them, 636 people are scheduled to depart from Shanghai next Monday morning on the large passenger liner *Conte Verde*. The remainder will be carried by the Japanese ship *Asama Maru*, which set sail from Yokohama at 1:35 AM on the 25th, carrying 416 American officials and civilians, including U.S. Ambassador to Japan Grew and his wife. The ship will dock in Hong Kong and Saigon to pick up a total of approximately 448 Americans awaiting repatriation from both locations. The ship will then sail to East Africa, where it will meet the *Conte Verde* coming from [Shanghai] in the Singapore Strait and proceed together. As for the Japanese officials and civilians in the United States, Canada, and South American countries, they have already boarded the Swedish passenger liner *Gripsholm* in New York and Rio de Janeiro, the capital of Brazil, respectively, and are sailing around Cape Horn, South America, across the Atlantic to East Africa. The entire journey will take about 30 days. Among those being repatriated are Japanese Ambassador to the United States Nomura, special envoy Kurusu, and Japanese consuls from New York, San Francisco, Honolulu, Chicago, and other places, as well as ambassadors, ministers, or chargés d'affaires from Brazil, Canada, Mexico, Panama, Peru, Colombia, Venezuela, and Cuba. It is understood that the three ships *Conte Verde*, *Asama Maru*, and *Gripsholm*, which are responsible for carrying the nationals, have all received guarantees of non-aggression from the belligerent countries. The crew and repatriated personnel will also not be interfered with by the belligerent countries. The second exchange of nationals between Japan and the United States is reportedly in the planning stages.

British Officials and Civilians to be Repatriated Next Month

Following the successful planning of the repatriation of 636 American officials and civilians, the repatriation of British nationals will also proceed step by step. According to information obtained by our reporter from relevant sources, British diplomatic and consular officials and ordinary civilians in the Japanese-controlled areas of inland China and coastal ports will successively come to Shanghai from their original locations to gather. Diplomats will be accommodated at the Cathay Hotel and the International Hotel, and ordinary civilians at the Country Club at 301 Avenue Haig. According to the consultation and decision of the governments of the countries concerned, the number of British officials and civilians to be evacuated from the Far East is also around 1,500. Those departing from China will be transported by the Japanese mail ship *Hakone Maru*, totaling about 850 people. The remaining 650 people will be transported by the *Tatsuta Maru* from Japan, Hong Kong, and Saigon to the designated repatriation exchange location. The two ships will generally depart from Shanghai and Yokohama simultaneously at the end of next month, and then meet in the South Sea and sail together to East Africa. As for the total number of British nationals in Shanghai, which is 4,854, less than half have registered for repatriation. Most of them will have to wait until the diplomatic and consular officials and nationals from other areas are evacuated before they can return to their country. Therefore, the first batch will be small in number and will not be able to leave. Even if they can be evacuated, the number may be the same as the Americans awaiting repatriation now, only a few dozen people.

### Robber Arrested for Shooting Victim

Fang Cheng-yi's Xi Yu Yarn Shop, located in Room 64, 1st Floor, 268 Beijing Road, was suddenly invaded by several armed robbers at 10:30 AM on the 21st of last month. At that time, a staff member of the shop, Wang Suisun, suddenly slammed the door shut, causing two robbers to be trapped inside, while the remaining robbers were locked outside. Angered, one of the two robbers inside pulled out a pistol and fired at Wang, hitting him in the abdomen. Not daring to steal anything, they hastily fled through the door. After Fang reported the incident to the police station, Wang Suisun was taken to Tongren Hospital for treatment, but he died the next day. The body was sent to the coroner's office for examination. The police were ordered to arrest the perpetrators. Now, Hua detectives Chen Fukang and Zhou Xichang from the Yulin Road Police Station arrested Wu Yinzhou, a 28-year-old Shaoxing native, who was the perpetrator of the case, on Avenue du Consulat in the French Concession yesterday. He has been brought into the police station for investigation and will be handed over for legal proceedings.

### Pure Wheat Flour Bread to be Supplied in Summer?

*The Shanghai Times* reports: Yesterday (the 25th), it was rumored in the city's bakeries that the two concessions may supply bread baked with pure wheat flour in the summer. Although this statement has not been officially confirmed, the general public believes that the authorities will take this action because bread containing corn flour easily turns sour in the hot summer. If the sale of bread made with pure wheat flour is realized, it is not yet known whether the price will remain the same or be increased.

### A Record of Receiving Rice Tickets

— Gan Cao

Recently, the two concessions implemented a system of allocating rice based on population, first issuing rice tickets, and then purchasing rice with the rice tickets. This measure is very fair and perfect. I live in the Avenue Foch District of the French Concession. Yesterday happened to be the day to receive rice tickets. I personally went to the Rue Tenant de la Tour police station to collect them. The procedure was exceptionally simple. I will briefly describe what I saw and heard below for the reference of esteemed heads of households.

The day before receiving the rice tickets, I visited a friend on Avenue Joffre. We talked about receiving the rice tickets in the evening and heard that it would be troublesome to queue and wait. I also thought that there would be many people involved and it would be complicated, and it would not be very convenient. However, it was not so. The reality was different from what I imagined. First of all, the Bao head was very enthusiastic. On the night before the rice tickets were issued, he first collected the household registration certificates, the May-June house rent receipts, and the household head's seal from the households under his jurisdiction. The seal must have been affixed to the Baojia pledge. The Bao head wrote the joint guarantee number and the number of households of the household on the back of the house rent receipt, and then returned it to each household head, and notified each household head to gather at 8:30 AM the next morning to go to the police station to collect the rice tickets. When it came to the next morning, the enthusiastic Bao head came to each household again to notify them to go. I happened to be having breakfast, and the households had already gone ahead. At ten minutes to nine, I took a tram to the police station. When I arrived, I saw men and women holding household registration certificates and house rent receipts standing in the courtyard.

In front of each door of the rice ticket collection office of the police station, there was a sign indicating the numbers of a certain road. I walked to the door I should go to. There was a patrolman and a Bao head guarding each door. They asked to see my household registration certificate and confirmed that it was correct, but told me that I had to enter in order. I lined up in the queue. There were only two people in front of me. In a short while, the people in front of me had already received their rice tickets and left. I went in in order, handed the household registration certificate and the house rent receipt to the first staff member, who registered them, and then transferred the household registration certificate and the rent receipt to the second staff member. The second staff member handed the number of rice tickets I should get, together with the household registration certificate and the rent receipt, to the third staff member. The third staff member asked for the household head's seal and affixed it on behalf of the household head. At this point, the procedure was completed, and the rice tickets were already in my hand. The household registration certificate, the house rent receipt, and the seal were also returned. The whole process took only five or six minutes, which was simple and orderly, and truly commendable.

Each rice ticket consists of four coupons for the first, second, third, and fourth periods. The number of the rice purchase point is printed on each period. When the police station distributes the rice tickets, it also includes a printed list of the numbers of the rice shops selling rice. According to the numbers printed on the rice tickets, check the rice shop number list again, and you can find it with one check.

Although the French police station distributes rice tickets very simply, it is very conscientious. The first staff member carefully checks the household registration certificate and the house rent receipt to verify the number of people living there. If there are any increases or decreases, they will ask strictly. The number of rice tickets issued is also checked by the third staff member to ensure that there are no errors before handing them over to the household head.

It is said that some heads of households do not care about receiving rice tickets, thinking that there is still surplus grain at home, and that even after allocating rice according to the population, Du rice can still be purchased. Why bother with this trouble? I don't think so. Receiving rice tickets is a right. Moreover, my family has no surplus grain. Even if there is Du rice to buy in the future, the price will be very expensive. In short, the two concessions' method of issuing rice tickets is very perfect and commendable. And the simplicity of the French Concession is entirely due to the perfection of the method.

### Shanghai West Gendarmerie Uncovers Counterfeit Savings Certificate Organization; Seizes Over 24,000 Five-Yuan Certificates

He Yun, a native of Suqian, 42 years old, lost his job after the war. He and Tian Desheng, a counterfeit legal tender offender, jointly used counterfeit Central Bank and other banknotes. Later, when Tian was arrested and imprisoned after being reported, He lost his livelihood and, together with Tian's wife and a Mr. Han, continued to counterfeit Central Reserve Bank certificates issued by the Central Reserve Bank for use in the market. The Shanghai West Gendarmerie learned of this and secretly sent personnel to 3998 Da Xu Lane, Rue Robert, where they arrested He on the spot and seized 24,750 counterfeit five-yuan Central Reserve Bank certificates. Han fled upon hearing the news. After interrogation, He confessed and was immediately sent to the court along with the evidence for legal punishment.

### Husband Deceased, Life Difficult, Entire Family Suffocates, One Son Dies, Others Near Death

A Cantonese woman, Chen Wangshi, 40 years old, had three children, the eldest son, Chen Guozhu, 18 years old, the second son, Guojun, 9 years old, and a daughter, Caixia, 16 years old. They lived together on the second floor of No. 15, Lane 225, Rue Gascogne. Her husband, Chen Zhengrong, used to teach in a school. During the August 13th Shanghai battle, he was killed by a bomb while passing through the Great World. Since her husband's death, Chen's living expenses and the education expenses of her children were subsidized by her eldest uncle, Chen Mo (a pediatrician who runs a clinic at No. 141 Avenue Joffre), which allowed them to barely survive. Recently, due to high living expenses and economic difficulties, the eldest son, Guozhu, and daughter, Caixia, were forced to drop out of school. Only Guojun was studying at Gan Cun Longmen Primary School on Rue Gascogne. Chen Wangshi was introduced by someone to work as a maid at the home of Lu Liangshi at No. 3, Lane 37, Avenue Joffre. The wages she earned were used to supplement the family. Unexpectedly, three days ago, a jewelry box belonging to Lu Liangshi, containing gold jewelry and 600 yuan in legal tender, and a bank deposit book suddenly disappeared. Lu suspected that Chen Wangshi had stolen it and fired her. After Chen Wangshi returned home, she felt wronged and sad about her miserable life and had thoughts of ending her life. On the day before yesterday (the 25th), Chen went out to buy coal briquettes and returned home. After dinner, her children were all asleep. Chen moved the coal stove into the room, added coal briquettes, and closed the windows and doors tightly. Then, Chen fell asleep with her youngest son. At about 9:00 AM yesterday morning, after the students of Longmen Primary School arrived, the teacher took attendance and found that Chen Guojun was missing. He sent someone to Chen's house to inquire. Unexpectedly, when they arrived at Chen's house and knocked on the door, there was no response. Feeling very surprised, someone broke open the door and found that the four members of the family had all suffered from coal poisoning. Except for her youngest son, Chen Guojun, who had died, the rest were pale and unconscious. They immediately reported to the police station and summoned a car to send the mother and children to Guangci Hospital. Chen Guojun could not be saved, and his body was sent to the coroner for examination. Chen Wangshi and her son Guozhu and daughter Caixia were severely poisoned and their lives were in danger.

Suicide Note

A woman from Yongji, Zhou Zhengshi, 32 years old, worked as a domestic helper at the home of a Mr. Chen at No. 575 Avenue Lafayette. Because she felt stimulated, she committed suicide. At 5:00 PM on the afternoon of the 18th, she swallowed Lysol disinfectant. After being discovered, she was sent to Guangci Hospital for enemas and other rescue measures. After she vomited the poison, she returned home at 7:00 PM. However, at 6:00 AM the next morning, the residual poison relapsed. She was sent to the hospital again, but the treatment was ineffective, and she died at 3:00 PM the following afternoon.

### Suicide by Poisoning or Death by Assault? The Cause of Wang Huaiqing's Death is Unknown; Dispute with Neighbor Prior to Death, Hospital Diagnoses Poisoning, Coroner Suspects Injury

Yang Qiting, a senior staff member of the Shanghai Velvet Factory, located at No. 88 Museum Road, his wife Yang Yu (24 years old, from Beiping), and his brother Yang Yimin (employee of Baochang Insurance Company) lived together in rooms 37 to 39 of the Shanghai Building at No. 374 Jiangxi Road. They employed a female servant surnamed Li. On May 16th of this year, the female servant was starting a coal stove, and the smoke blew into the room of Wang Huaiqing (52 years old, from Anhui, worked as a nurse at the Red Cross), who lived in the opposite room, room 404.

This caused a conflict. At that time, Wang kicked the coal stove into pieces. After Li reported the incident to the female owner, Yang Yu, Yang negotiated with Wang and demanded compensation, which led to a dispute and mutual violence. From then on, they argued every day and could not resolve their hatred. Unexpectedly, on the afternoon of the 21st of this month, Wang Huaiqing suddenly changed into new clothes and went to Yang's house and sat there, refusing to leave. Before long, her face changed drastically. When Yang Qiting saw this, he knew that something was wrong and rushed Wang to Renji Hospital. The doctor diagnosed that she had ingested poison and gave her enemas and other emergency treatments, but she died on the 23rd. After the Central Police Station received the report, Hua detective Feng Qishan investigated and found that the deceased had sent all her clothes to the Shanghai Building administrator Ma Zhongxin before going to Yang's house. He also found a note in her room, which read, "If Mr. Ma can handle this matter, I will not die. But Ma is afraid of the Yang family." At the same time, Wang's body was sent to the coroner's office. After the coroner, Hou Guangdi, examined the body, there were no injuries on the surface. However, the deceased's nephew, Wang Jingcheng, insisted that she was beaten to death, so an autopsy was performed. After Hou's autopsy, it was found that there was no poison in the deceased's stomach, but there were bruises, indicating that she may have been killed by injury. Although the police investigation showed that the deceased did indeed take poison, because of the coroner's report, which suggested that she may have been beaten to death, Yang Yu and Yang Yimin were charged with causing death by injury. The court has issued summons. Therefore, it must be investigated whether Wang's death was due to suicide by poisoning or death by assault before a conclusion can be reached.

### The Rising Tide of Control Rumors Causes a Sharp Drop in Cloth Prices; Shirting and Poplin Each Fall by 20 Yuan

Factory Cloth: Yesterday's market was affected by the approaching end of the sixth period. Yarn prices fell sharply, and rumors of increasing government controls spread, causing widespread panic. Prices of all types of cloth fell sharply across the board. 16-pound Globe coarse cloth was priced at 180 yuan, Flying Goose at 175 yuan, 9-pound New Character at 112 yuan, 8-pound Zhenzhong at 109 yuan, and 12-pound Globe poplin opened at 160 yuan in the morning, later falling to 157 yuan, Dapeng at 150 yuan, and Fugui New Single at 153 yuan. The difference in price between coarse and fine cloth was about 10 yuan per piece. The drop in Peach Blossom Shirting was particularly severe, starting at 268 yuan and gradually decreasing to 253 yuan after transactions, a sharp drop of 22 yuan compared to the previous day. Mulan Bleached Cloth was at 155 yuan, Qin Liangyu at 151 yuan, and Jacquard Poplin fell to around 2.30 yuan per yard.

East Cloth 12-pound Poplin new stock opened at 187 yuan in the morning and closed at 176 yuan at noon, a sharp drop of 19.50 yuan compared to the previous day's closing price. Silver ingot single poplin closed at 151 yuan at noon, Colored Ball poplin at 157 yuan, Flying Fish at 52 yuan, Yanghe at 15[blank] yuan, and Four Gentlemen serge red single opened at 7.15 yuan, fell, and closed at 6.80 yuan, also a drop of 0.54 yuan.

### Woolen Cloth and Western Suits: The French Concession Takes the Lead in Price Reductions

The prices of woolen cloth and Western suits in the French Concession have already been reduced, in compliance with the French Municipal Council's policy of stabilizing prices. As a result, fellow merchants at the Western Suit Emporium on Avenue Joffre held consecutive meetings to discuss and resolve to calculate the average exchange rate between the old currency and the new currency from the 26th to the 28th of last month, halve that average, and send letters to all stores, large and small, setting price limits. All stores must comply and not raise prices privately, or face penalties. The agreed-upon price limits are as follows: Labor costs (for materials provided by the customer) for winter are 250 yuan for first-class, 220 yuan for second-class, and 180 yuan for third-class. For summer, they are 200 yuan for first-class, 175 yuan for second-class, and 150 yuan for third-class. Satin Western serge costs extra. The price of a suit is the same as the price of a jacket. Cheviot serge is priced the same as flannel. First-class linen labor cost is 120 yuan, second-class is 100 yuan, and third-class is 80 yuan. 707 plain thick cloth is limited to 175 yuan, Meifeng overcoating cloth to 400 yuan, camel hair serge to 320 yuan for first-class, 280 yuan for second-class, and 240 yuan for third-class. Public Sea Harris plain cornelian board is 480 yuan, checkered is 90 yuan, Henderson flannel is 175 yuan, and flannel with the factory's name is 230 yuan, without the factory's name is 200 yuan.

### Public Bonds Experience a Sharp Decline as Panic-Stricken Investors Rush to Sell

Yesterday's over-the-counter market for public bonds was affected by the Municipal Council's announcement, causing some investor panic and prompting many to sell. Although Type C bonds opened at 39.30 yuan, only 5,000 were traded. Subsequently, the price fell from 39 yuan to 38 yuan, with only a few transactions. After breaking through 38 yuan, formal transactions began. Because of the large number of sellers in the beginning, many were unable to sell above 38 yuan. Fortunately, there were some who covered their short positions in the market, otherwise the fall would have been even greater. The public bond market has been a spot market for the past five years, simply bringing together industry members in one room to exchange views. It has never had the characteristics of futures speculation from previous periods, so there is no need for alarm. However, formal procedures should be supplemented in the future. As a result, prices fell across the board by 1.30 yuan to 2.60 yuan, with approximately 2 million yuan in transactions. A simplified table is listed below: Type Highest Lowest Closing Compared to Previous Day Unified A 41.10 40.00 40.70 Down 1.30 Unified B 39.00 36.50 36.70 Down 2.50 Unified C 39.30 36.50 36.60 Down 2.60 Unified – 26.50 24.50 24.50 Down 2.10 Unified E 36.80 35.00 25.80 Down 1.80

### Sharp Drop in Chinese Stocks

Yesterday, Chinese stocks experienced a significant decline, especially in the new pharmaceutical industry, which suffered a complete collapse. The decline in the department store industry was less severe, while the textile industry remained relatively stable. The cultural industry experienced a noticeable decline. Due to investor uncertainty, trading volume remained high. Detailed market prices are listed below: Type Highest Lowest Last New Asia New 44.00 40.00 41.00 Sino-French New 80.00 75.00 75.00 Min 78.00 72.50 75.00 Sino-British 215.00 Underwear 35.00 30.00 31.00 Wing On 110.00 90.00 92.50 Sun Sun 125.00 95.00 100.00 Sincere 160.00 137.50 157.50 Commercial Press 305.00 300.00 China 200.00 195.00 195.00 World 140.00 131.50 131.50 Nanyang Brothers Tobacco 78.00 12.50 12.50 Great China 195.00 190.00 192.50 Zhabei Electric 33.10 21.00 21.50

China Merchants Electric 29.00 27.00 2[blank].00 Jin Cheng Bank 320.00 Tianli Gas 3[blank].00

### Foreign Stocks Weaken

Yesterday, foreign stocks continued to weaken. China Textiles buyers initially bid 38 yuan, then 37 yuan, and Sino-British at 36.75 yuan, all with transactions. Xiangtai Timber had buyers at 28 yuan, Tramways were bought at 68 yuan and sold at 70 yuan, Ewo Yarns at 42 yuan, Public Buses at 15 yuan, Ewo Brewery at 13 yuan, and Paper Industry at 12.50 yuan, all with sellers. There were no price quotes for other stocks, it was said.

### Checks and Cash Are Equal

Yesterday, the Shanghai Bankers Association's discount rate remained at 0.18 yuan. The discount rate for new drafts was equal to that of cash. Illegal discounting operations dare not try it anymore. Military supplies remained at 5.50 yuan.

### Publicly Allocated Beans Are Supplied Daily

Yesterday, transactions in beans were increasingly scarce, because publicly allocated beans are supplied daily, while free trading faces many difficulties, so few people inquired. The market was quiet and lacked spirit. The unified market only traded 12 packs of Qingdao tea beans at a price of 205 yuan, 50 packs of Jiading white broad beans at a price of 170 yuan, 30 packs of Chongming sand red beans at a price of 163 yuan, and 40 packs of Benniu red beans at a price of 140 yuan.

### Bean Cake Transactions Prohibited

Yesterday, there were no bean cake transactions because the authorities prohibited warehouse receipt trading. The unified market only traded 200 pieces of June old stock Shengji bean cake at a price of 47 yuan. The market was weak. Other goods were also mostly in a state of stagnation.

### Tianjin Preserved Vegetables Are Already on Sale

Recently, 50 or 60 [blanks] of Tianjin preserved vegetables were shipped from Tianjin. The quality and aroma are both excellent. Sales began yesterday at a price of 360 yuan. Only local streets have seen transactions, but the trend is moderately stable.

### Sales of New Steel Plates Are Sluggish

Transactions in new steel plates have traditionally relied heavily on local shipyards. Since recently, the industry has declined, and purchases have stopped. The movement of new steel plates can be verified. There has been no pickup, making it difficult for other users to procure. As a result, there have been virtually no actual transactions. Moreover, with rumors of government controls over various industries, stockholders have been eager to sell since yesterday, but buyers are unwilling to collect. Therefore, the market atmosphere for all goods is particularly weak, and prices are inevitably falling. Currently, 2.5 to 7.5% alloy steel is selling for 10,020 yuan per ton, and 1% or thicker alloy steel is priced at 13,000 yuan per ton. The prices of other goods are also stagnant. New sheet piles are at 10,030 yuan, bamboo-joint steel bars at 9,000 yuan, and foreign square plate blanks at 9,000 yuan.

### The Shortage of Low-Grade Cigarettes Keeps Prices Firm

The cigarette market has generally been sluggish recently, due to the rainy season, with limited inflow and mostly outflow. Both industry insiders and stockholders have largely stopped, resulting in a narrow sales channel. In addition, recent rumors of profit sharing and the continuous distribution of price-controlled goods, coupled with tight credit conditions for industry members, have forced them to sell their inventory for cash flow. Buyers' appetites are extremely weak. Due to these factors, the market is trending downward. As a result, low-grade cigarettes are in short supply in the market and among industry members, with strong demand, keeping prices relatively high, not far from those of medium-grade cigarettes. Yesterday's trading prices were: Big Ben at 8,400 yuan, Old Knife at 5,400 yuan, Pin Hai at 4,500 yuan, Little Fairy at 4,000 yuan, Five Flowers at 3,850 yuan, [blank] Yuqiang at 1,470 yuan, Golden Building at 1,250 yuan, Red Rose at 1,350 yuan, Quanlu at 1,960 yuan, 指南 at 1,750 yuan, Guoyan Golden Mouse at 1,900 yuan, and Beauty at 3,400 yuan.

### Gorgon Fruit Sales Are Weak

The supply of gorgon fruit is adequate and inventories are sufficient, but due to sluggish sales and quiet trading, and high costs, most people are taking a wait-and-see attitude. However, yesterday 10 packs of white-skinned goods were sold, with prices not significantly different from previous market prices.

### Mourning Yan Jupeng

— Master of the Plum Blossom Hall

Reading the Beiping Drama News on the 20th, there was a report that "Famous actor Yan Jupeng is seriously ill." Now I have received the sad news that Jupeng passed away on the 23rd. His children, Huizhu, Shaopeng, etc., are all singing in Dong Province and did not make it back in time. His eldest daughter is handling the funeral arrangements alone. The family is in very difficult circumstances. A generation of famous actors has passed away in this way. Isn't it a pity!

Jupeng was a member of the Banner people, a nobleman of the Qing Dynasty. He graduated from the Qing Clan School, and his knowledge of Chinese classics was profound. After graduating, he had nothing to do and enjoyed listening to operas every day. He was particularly familiar with Tan Xinpei's voice and demeanor. Later, he studied with the famous opera master Chen Yanheng, researching Tan's school of opera. He was dedicated and sought diligently. For more than ten years, he never stopped. Yanheng once said to me, "Jupeng has both high talent and deep learning. No one is more suitable to inherit Tan's mantle than this gentleman." Yanheng's words, although somewhat exaggerated, are enough to show Jupeng's extraordinary achievements.

Around 1921, Mei Lanfang came to Shanghai to perform at the invitation of the Gongwu Stage, and Jupeng was assigned the role of the male lead. His new voice was a sensation. Lanfang was humble and willing to let Jupeng take the lead, and played the Second Imperial Concubine in the "Pearl Curtain Village." At that time, Jupeng's fame was evident. Since then, Jupeng has come to Shanghai to perform several times, and his reputation has always been good. His last performance at the Carlton last year was also quite successful, but his voice was not as clear and melodious as it had been in previous performances.

Accurate enunciation was Jupeng's only strength, unmatched by any other leading actor in the opera world. His costume was slightly shabby, and his stage movements were not very standard. Those who come from amateur backgrounds are generally not very particular about their appearance on stage, and Jupeng was not the only one like this.

Jupeng's voice was most suitable for recording, so his status in the recording industry was superior to that of other actors. Every company's product had his famous arias. His famous works include Victor's "Replacing the Prince in the Execution Ground," Gaoting's "Bao Lian Deng" from "Famen Temple," Baikai's "Scolding the Palace" from "Si Lang Visits His Mother," and Great Wall's "The Empty City Stratagem" and "Ascending to Heaven." Their sales were comparable to those of Ma Lianliang's famous records, and their popularity remains to this day.

Jupeng had four children. His eldest daughter married early. His second daughter, Huizhu, studies Mei-style female roles, and is one of the four famous female actors in the old capital. His eldest son, Shaopeng, studies male roles and has been apprenticed to Ma Lianliang. His second son, Xiaopeng, studies both civil and military male roles, and is skilled in martial arts operas. Both sons are talented, but have not achieved great success. His first wife died early. His second wife, Ms. Gao, was once divorced, but they have since reunited. Gao Yi'an, who is on the screen, is Jupeng's second wife, and the mother of Huizhu, Shaopeng, and Xiaopeng. (On the left is a posthumous portrait of Yan Jupeng)

### Chen Yunshang's Ill-Fated Life

— Yan Ciping

Miss Chen Yunshang, who is so lucky on the screen, is very unfortunate in her life off-screen! She lost her father two years ago. Her mourning period is not yet over, her tears have not yet dried; the wound in her heart has not yet healed. Suddenly, her beloved mother was summoned by God. Mrs. Chen's illness was a relapse of stroke, with a ruptured blood vessel in the brain. This acute condition was untreatable. Therefore, although Miss Chen hired many famous Chinese and Western doctors at the time, it was difficult to save Mrs. Chen's life.

Mrs. Chen was kind and amiable when she was alive, especially towards her three beloved daughters, whom she loved and cared for very much. Therefore, although Yunshang is a famous star on the screen, when she returns home, she is like a little bird, clinging to her mother, knowing nothing and caring about nothing. The several servants in the Chen house, and Miss Zeng, a female secretary who also manages household affairs, are all under Mrs. Chen's command. Since Mrs. Chen passed away, the Chen mansion on Curlews Road is very different from what it was a week ago. The streamlined piano is covered with a thin layer of dust, and has not been touched by the slender hands of the hostess for a long time. Miss Yunshang is grieving and crying all day long, and her throat has become hoarse in a few days. Yunshang's adopted sister, Tong Yuejuan, and others come to comfort her and accompany her every day. Because Miss Chen is young and timid, and also because this house easily makes her sad, she has moved to her adopted mother's house for a short stay these days.

A week ago, when Miss Yunshang was extremely sad, a "Chen Yunshang Wedding Special" was published outside, which gave Yunshang a double shock, a blow within a blow, which was too absurd. A movie star with millions of audiences, whether male or female, will invisibly lose their audience after she (or he) gets married.

(This is also the case in Hollywood.) Therefore, any smart and well-established movie star will never dare to resolve her life's major event when she is young, and hinder her great and brilliant future.

Miss Yunshang is one of the most intelligent movie stars. How could she give up her millions of audiences and her brilliant future! In order to avoid rumors from others, she dares not get too close to anyone except her adopted sisters and female friends.

On the screen, she is a lively, darling, and off the screen, she is an independent orphan. She said with tears, "I didn't have to worry about anything before, but now I have to support my younger sisters. I really don't know what to do?"

I wish you courage and take on the important task! On the screen, you will always shine with great brilliance! And receive the love of millions of movie fans!

### The Cause and Effect of Yan Jupeng's Death

— Only Me

(Beiping Airmail) I returned from Shanghai the day before yesterday, and unexpectedly received the news on the train that the famous actor Yan Jupeng had passed away at dawn on the 20th due to hemoptysis. Jupeng was the only Confucian actor of his time, and those in our field all had a good impression of him. The sad news came, and we should all mourn together. Regarding Jupeng's death, I must record it, and briefly describe it as follows:

Distant Causes

Jupeng was addicted to hobbies and his body was weak. He should have taken good care of himself, which is the way to maintain health. However, this man was eccentric by nature and always sloppy when it came to eating, especially not paying attention to hygiene, which was often talked about. Secondly, I saw a pile of candy in Jupeng's bedroom, with flies all over the table, but he didn't care and continued to eat one piece after another, with an unusually good appetite. This man had a quick temper and often lost his temper for no reason. For example, whenever he performed, if the attendance was not good, he would be fine. But if it was a full house, Mr. Yan would vent his anger on his children and wife with complaints, so that the whole family would avoid him when they saw him. His falling out with his wife Gao Yi'an in his early years, and his falling out with his second daughter Huizhu in recent years, these are all distant causes of his illness.

Recent Causes

Since the family troupe performed, and Jupeng's appeal was not as good as his daughter Huizhu's, Jupeng, although old, was still ambitious and unwilling to accept this. However, because the attendance in Beiping was really unsatisfactory, he went to the south of the Yangtze River last year. Frankly speaking, it was not easy for Jupeng to achieve such results in his two last trips to Shanghai at his age. However, his last performance at the Carlton, which included performing a grand finale and occasional private performances, although he managed to get through it at the time, in reality, his physical condition could no longer support it. After returning to Beiping, he should have rested for a long time, but he actually sang "Si Lang Visits His Mother" and "Entering the Palace Twice," which caused the hemoptysis to recur. Since then, it recurred and healed repeatedly, for a long time. Last year, after singing the collaborative opera "Er Zhuan Gong" with the female actor Tong Zhiling, his illness worsened again, so he declined all invitations and rested at home. In addition to seeking medical treatment, he meditated in the Buddha hall every day, reciting scriptures to entertain himself. He gradually improved last winter. At the end of the year, I saw him and his son Shaopeng listening to Liu Baoquan's storytelling at the Kaiming Theater, but not long after, I heard that Jupeng had another quarrel with his wife Gao Yi'an. After that, Gao Yi'an left again. Jupeng taught his second son Xiaopeng opera, and got angry with Xiaopeng and his wife. Then, the siblings Huizhu and Shaopeng were hired to perform in Manchuria. Jupeng did not approve of it and made a big scene, and said to the siblings Huizhu: "If you go, you won't see me when you come back!" Unexpectedly, it became a prophecy. Originally, Jupeng's body was getting worse every year. In recent years, he was not very happy with his career, and he was also often angry. Jupeng really couldn't think things through.

Aftermath

Although Jupeng's illness was called hemoptysis, it was actually lung disease. Recently, both Chinese and Western doctors have been helpless. While Jupeng was ill, his eldest daughter Boming and his beloved son-in-law You Lesan attended him. Shaopeng and Xiaopeng and Huizhu were all performing in Manchuria. Because Shaopeng was the eldest son, he was summoned back when Jupeng was seriously ill. When Shaopeng returned to Beiping, although he was able to see his father's last moments, Jupeng was already dying. Jupeng's body was put into the coffin that day (the 20th) afternoon. The coffin cost more than 800 yuan. It is said that although Huizhu is far away in Manchuria, she is fully responsible for Jupeng's funeral arrangements. However, Mrs. Gao Yi'an is still at home. People in the Yan family advocate that the funeral be completed before notifying her. It is unknown what Ms. Gao will think when she hears the news in Shanghai.

Conclusion

Jupeng was a Manchu of the Zhenglan Banner. His original name was Xiqi. His great-grandfather, Song Yun, was a Qing Dynasty scholar. Jupeng served in the Ministry of Finance and the Mongolian-Tibetan Affairs Bureau in his early years. He came from a bureaucratic family. When Jupeng was an amateur actor, he was famous for his singing. When Tan Xinpei performed in various gardens, Jupeng was always a guest. Therefore, he learned a lot of the essence of Tan's singing. He once studied with Chen Yanheng and other celebrities. Someone like Jupeng can be said to have "seen the good and learned the good," which is naturally different from ordinary people. Judging from Jupeng in his later years, except for the inadequacy of his voice, everything else was beyond the reach of any other male actor. His emphasis on sharp and round sounds, yin and yang, and his accent, was usually admired by insiders. In recent years, watching Jupeng's stage skills reach perfection, I feel that there is no second person in the world who can compare. Jupeng came from an amateur background, but his body and face were surprisingly subtle. This is Jupeng's greatest achievement in the past ten years. From this, we can also see that his "skills" are also very impressive. When Jupeng went south last year, the gentlemen in the Pingju opera world greatly praised him, and they all regarded him as "the only person after the old Tan." It is a pity that Jupeng's wife was not virtuous and his children were not filial, which led to him getting sick and dying due to family disputes, which is very sad! (Sent on the 23rd)

### Mei News

— Ming

The news that Dr. Mei Wan Hua has returned to Shanghai is making a lot of noise. This newspaper has repeatedly published it, and it is widely rumored that he has already arrived in Shanghai, which is premature. According to the news last night, Mei will indeed arrive in Shanghai in the near future, but the date is still undetermined.

### Sharing the Same Boat in Storms

— By He Jia Zhi

(6) An Instant

The blazing summer has suddenly arrived again, and the leaves around the Shide Hall are still as green as in previous years. In previous years at this time, Wei Cheng would be home for summer vacation. His mother was always eagerly waiting, watching Wei Cheng pay his respects to his father's portrait. His mother would say, "Second Aunt, look at our Wei Cheng, he's grown taller again this year than last. Eating food year after year, he's bound to grow." This voice still revolves in Wei Cheng's ears. Wei Cheng could choose not to think about it, but once he thinks about it, he feels a pang in his nose, and his eyes involuntarily become moist. But Wei Cheng often thinks about it; seeing the flourishing green leaves makes him think, as does seeing the heavily laden watermelon vines and the rows of sunflowers seemingly welcoming the sun, and the thoughtful corn stalks. He thinks, "This is when I would be home for summer vacation in previous years." Cui Zhen, seeing Wei Cheng's deeply suppressed demeanor, knows that he is feeling emotional again, and always interrupts his train of thought, calling out, "Brother Cheng, what are you thinking about? Just now in the fields, I saw someone in green walking on the main road. Could it be that there's news from Shanghai?" Wei Cheng, hearing that the postman had delivered a letter, hurriedly asked his family members who had received a letter from Shanghai. In reality, this was Cui Zhen's little joke. Cui Zhen was afraid that Wei Cheng was unhappy, and this way, his unhappiness would be stopped.

Speaking of a letter from Shanghai, a letter did indeed arrive the day after. It was jointly signed by Guo Qi, Guo Fang, and others. Wei Cheng could tell that it was written by Guo Fang. The letter said: "Please come to Shanghai. If you can't come, there's nothing we can do. It's summer vacation for us now, and our grandmother is thinking about her grandsons and granddaughters again, wanting us to come to the village to escape the summer heat. Big watermelons, cut open to see if the flesh is yellow, red, or snowy white. Fried rice noodles mixed with sugar, just dry eating. Everyone eats quietly, and if anyone opens their mouth, a gust of wind will scatter the powder on the ground. And other things, other things, other things. Wei Cheng, you come, you come to Shuangqiao. Don't push back saying that you've suffered a great tragedy and can't have fun. Even if you just come to share your pain, it's fine. We will definitely return to Shuangqiao in the sixth month of the lunar calendar. You can pick a morning, or a cloudy afternoon. Bring your underwear, don't forget!" Wei Cheng, after reading the letter, was excited. (213)
