Somewhere on the Ukrainian Border, Sixth Day, Havas News Agency Electric Dispatch

In recent days, there have been no major changes on the Eastern Front. German forces continue to advance in the Stalingrad area. The Red Army is still employing a strategy of feinting east and attacking west, launching offensives in the north of Stalingrad and the Volonezh Erchev areas. The Red Army's resistance is centered on the northern outskirts of Stalingrad. Although the situation is extremely difficult, they have not given up hope of resistance and can at least hold part of the city. They are currently continuing counterattacks in the northern outskirts of Stalingrad, especially in the Gachkano district. As for the Red Army's large-scale offensive in the Volonezh district, its purpose is clearly to feint east and attack west, thereby restraining German forces and forcing them to withdraw troops from the Stalingrad front. However, the German High Command is prepared for the Red Army's strategy and has stationed 25 divisions to cope with the Red Army's pressure. Generally speaking, the Red Army's offensive in the Erchev district ended on the fourth of this month. However, this move was quite important during the German summer offensive. The battles in this area were commanded by Generals Zhukov and Koniev, posing a serious threat to the German positions and breaking through the German first line of defense several times. However, the result did not force the Germans to transfer troops from Stalingrad, and after three weeks of hard fighting, the Germans have restored their original positions.

Berlin, Seventh Day, Huitong News Agency Electric Dispatch

The German army withdrew two companies of infantry from the danger zone to await a counterattack. Before long, explosions occurred, and Soviet artillery suddenly opened fire, followed by infantry attacks. At this time, the retreating German troops also began to advance and counterattack. A melee ensued, and as a result, the Soviet troops were unable to withstand the attack and retreated. The German army finally recaptured its original positions.

### Stalin's Explicit Expression Makes the Relationship Between the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union Subtle; the U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union Will Return Home to Report on His Work to Find Ways to Adjust the Strategy

Stockholm, Sweden, Sixth Day, Allied News Agency Electric Dispatch

After Stalin answered questions from the Associated Press reporter, the relationship between the Soviet Union and the United States and Britain suddenly entered a subtle state. According to a Moscow dispatch, U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union Stanley has decided to return home by plane within a few days to make concessions with the government on the relationship between the United States and the Soviet Union.

Moscow, Seventh Day, Allied News Agency Electric Dispatch

The military attaches of the U.S. Embassy are directly related to this matter. Ambassador Stanley also answered a reporter's question, saying that the general impression here is that the United States is not providing enough assistance to the Soviet Union, and he plans to adjust it. However, he has been away from the country for a long time and should go back to find a way. Ambassador Stanley met with Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov on Monday.

President Roosevelt finally announced that he intends to deliver a broadcast speech within ten days.

Under Secretary of State Welles told the press today that the government has not instructed U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Rear Admiral Stanley, to ask Stalin to further explain his true attitude towards the request to open a second front. According to political figures here, the British and American governments have not responded to Stalin's written statement the other day.

### Britain's Symptoms, Military Supplies, Aid to the Soviet Union, Three Countries Sign an Agreement; Churchill Does Not Want to Say Much About Opening the Second Front

Lisbon, Seventh Day, Allied News Agency Electric Dispatch

According to Washington, the U.S. State Department announced yesterday that U.S. Under Secretary of State Welles, British Minister Campbell, and Soviet Ambassador Litvinov have signed a protocol stipulating that Britain and the United States will supply the Soviet Union with military equipment, munitions, and all military supplies. This matter has been going on for several months, and this protocol is just a formal stipulation.

London, Sixth Day, Havas News Agency Electric Dispatch

At the House of Commons meeting today, members of parliament asked the Prime Minister to express his opinion on Stalin's written statement to American reporters the other day. The Prime Minister immediately replied that he had nothing to say about the second front and hoped that the members of the House would not insist on asking about this issue in this emergency. However, Labour Party member Bevin still said that all factories in the British arms industry are currently discussing Mr. Stalin's statement. Does the Prime Minister know about it? Since the people are discussing this issue, I don't understand why the House of Commons cannot study this matter. If the misunderstanding between the Soviet Union and our country is allowed to develop, it will have serious consequences for our country's war industry. I don't know if the Prime Minister understands this. Now that there is an opportunity to explain, I think the Prime Minister should take advantage of it and not miss the opportunity. Prime Minister Churchill immediately replied that he had explained the current situation and had also issued a statement on the issue of aid to the Soviet Union a few days ago. At this moment, he really has nothing to add. At this point, a member asked whether the British and Soviet general staffs were maintaining contact. The Prime Minister replied that he had already issued a statement on this matter and did not want to add anything to it. He refused to make any comments under the pressure of the current situation other than the solemn declaration he made the other day.

Soviet Union Appeals, US and British Reactions

Lisbon, Seventh Day, Huitong News Agency Electric Dispatch

According to Washington news, American newspapers commented on Stalin's call for the immediate opening of a second front to help the Soviet Union, believing that the Allies should be in the same boat. Although the Soviet Union's situation is critical, whether the second front should be opened immediately must be decided by Britain and the United States.

Zurich, Switzerland, Sixth Day, Havas News Agency Electric Dispatch

Newspapers here today carried dispatches from correspondents in London saying that people from all walks of life in Britain have been discussing Stalin's written statement to American reporters yesterday, and there are different opinions. Among them, The Spectator and The New Statesman criticized the Soviet dictator the most. For example, The Spectator stated that we are prepared to do everything we can to help the Soviet Union, which Stalin himself knows very well. In the past, when Britain was unprepared and forced to fight Germany, if the Soviet Union could open a second front, the world situation today could be completely changed. I don't know if Mr. Stalin knows this. In 1940, Britain sent expeditions to Norway and Belgium and participated in the Battle of France. On the Soviet side, they stood by and did not want to stop Germany in time. It is useless to criticize past actions, but the British people are unwilling to be taught by people who also have shortcomings. Furthermore, Swiss newspaper correspondents in Britain believe that the result of this dispute may enable Soviet military experts to join the Allied Supreme Military Council to coordinate the activities of the Allied Army, Navy, and Air Force.

Quality of British-Made Tanks

London, Sixth Day, Havas News Agency Electric Dispatch

At the House of Commons meeting today, Labour Party members and Willes asked about the quality of British tanks, stating that the reason why the British army failed to occupy a bridgehead on the continent and instead suffered losses in the Dieppe landing was due to the inefficiency of our tanks. Prime Minister Lan announced that the progress of our tank column was blocked at every street corner, which was unexpected. He asked the Secretary of State for War to explain. However, Secretary of State for War Grenville refused to provide any information. At this point, Labour Party member Stokes shouted loudly that if he could not provide an explanation, he would of course not be able to answer. The Secretary of State for War continued to say that British arsenals are now manufacturing a new type of tank, the quality of which is absolutely superior to that used by the Axis powers. It has been named the Type 27 tank.

### Acts of Sabotage in Norway Occur Frequently; Germany Takes Strict Measures and Declares Martial Law in Trondheim

Stockholm, Sweden, Seventh Day, Havas News Agency Electric Dispatch

The Norwegian government announced today that ten people have been executed after acts of sabotage occurred in the city of Trondheim, including a shipbuilder, a banker, a journalist, a lawyer, a theater manager, and a captain. According to unconfirmed reports, 700 Norwegian workers have been arrested in the city in recent days. Yesterday, the German High Commissioner in Norway, Terboven, delivered a speech in the Norwegian capital, stating that various acts of sabotage that endanger materials and security have been occurring throughout the territory for quite some time. He has been tolerant, but because the cases are occurring frequently, he has no choice but to take strict measures. No one can make him lenient.

Stockholm, Sweden, Sixth Day, Havas News Agency Electric Dispatch

Martial law has been declared in the province of Trondheim, Norway, due to multiple sabotage cases. The situation is generally calm. Previous reports that eight Norwegians were killed in the port of Trondheim at 6:00 PM yesterday have not been officially confirmed. General Rediess, the German police chief in Norway and commander of the National Socialist Party's security force, has arrived in the port of Trondheim in person to preside over everything. He answered a telephone call from a journalist, saying that the local security is as calm as usual and that the German and Norwegian police authorities have received reports that someone is attempting to sabotage the railway from Trondheim to Mosjøen. In addition, he indirectly admitted that several members of the Norwegian National Socialist Party under the leadership of Quisling have recently been arrested for inciting culture and transportation. The recent declaration of martial law is not entirely unrelated to this, but it is not the main reason. The Oslo radio station also broadcasted a report today on the situation in Trondheim, but did not mention the reason for the declaration of martial law, only saying that at a time when the German army is fighting fiercely, its enemies, who are also Norway's enemies, are trying to use secret workers to carry out sabotage in our country. It is time to eliminate these dangerous elements. The party's martial law order is a warning to saboteurs.

### The Governor-General of Madagascar Narrowly Escapes Death as British Aircraft Bomb French Positions

Havas News Agency, Vichy, 6th

The Colonial Department recently released a war report from Madagascar, stating that after suffering heavy losses in the Battle of Androka Plain, the British forces finally occupied Antsirabé. This city is the terminus of the railway line leading south from the capital of Madagascar, with a population of 20,000. However, since the fall of the city, the enemy's progress has virtually stalled. They have only been using aircraft to bomb French positions between Antsirabé and Fianarantsoa, and attacking vehicles traveling on various highways. Yesterday, some civilians were injured. Governor-General Annet of Madagascar was inspecting the positions in the Ambalavao district, 70 miles south of Antsirabé, when the car he was traveling in was suddenly hit by enemy bombs and completely destroyed. The Governor-General managed to escape in time, narrowly avoiding death. The enemy falsely claims that Governor-General Annet is hiding in the deep mountains of the island's interior, far from the front lines. This claim has been refuted by the aforementioned news.

It is reported that the second group of graduates will soon be assigned to their posts, while the second group of students will go to Shanghai and depart for Japan as soon as a ship is available.

### Government Spokespersons (II)

No Censorship

Perhaps largely due to the competence of this spokesperson and the abilities of other intelligence bureau personnel, the German government abolished censorship of telegrams and telephone calls from foreign correspondents, even during wartime. This was predicated on patiently training foreign correspondents. This training initially caused some difficulties, but eventually all difficulties were overcome. The training was extremely successful, and even during the war, foreign correspondents and German authorities generally cooperated satisfactorily.

With the continuous occurrence of major events over the past decade, Berlin has become a "Kingdom (Eldorado)" dreamed of by every journalist. The reports made by foreign correspondents in Berlin on the development of each major event often attracted more interest from readers around the world than the reports made by correspondents stationed in other capitals. Every good journalist did not want to give up this advantage, so he inevitably avoided talking about things that should be avoided in a belligerent country.

Reporters and Speed

Although time management may not exactly be a journalist's daily bread, it is at least his butter and jam. Therefore, on important occasions, Dr. Schmidt would send news that needed to be announced urgently, printed on mimeographs or rapid printing machines, to the correspondents. In even more important occasions, he would convene temporary press conferences. Some of the past temporary press conferences were convened when the German army took new military actions. The personal participation of the press in the occurrence of world-shaking events reached its dramatic climax at this time.

Sometimes, executive meetings in Berlin were convened in the middle of the night. Of course, every correspondent's residence was equipped with a telephone, but to prevent any of them from losing the opportunity to obtain news, Dr. Schmidt adopted a good method. Half an hour or an hour before the meeting, when it was still dark, the telephone would ring. Even the sleepiest person would be awakened. In case he was sound asleep, the intelligence bureau would call the police station in the district and send a policeman to his residence to wait for him. If he didn't have a car, the policeman would find him a car for the trip. Therefore, even the slowest person could arrive in time for the meeting. Usually, the foreign minister and the propaganda minister personally attended meetings convened on such occasions. If Germany was about to declare war on or attack a certain place, the moment the action began was often the time when the press conference was convened.

The fact that foreign correspondents stationed in Germany were able to go to the front lines to observe the war was also largely due to Dr. Schmidt's understanding of the mission of correspondents. Almost every correspondent in Berlin had been to Poland, the Netherlands, Belgium, France, Yugoslavia, Greece, and the Soviet Union. Sometimes they arrived at the front lines before the war was completely over, and sudden outbreaks of fire forced them to temporarily halt their journey.

Roosevelt and Reporters

The star among spokespersons was President Roosevelt of the United States. He held press conferences in his study almost every day. Foreign correspondents newly arrived in Washington often considered it a major event to be interviewed by Roosevelt for the first time. In a sense, this was true, because nowhere else but in Washington could you meet a president who received you in the capacity of a spokesperson.

Roosevelt, the spokesperson for the Washington government—in fact, the spokesperson for his own policies—was the first person to recognize the importance of newspapers. Because he was good at understanding the psychology of his compatriots, he often wanted to convey his opinions directly to the 100 million American newspaper readers. His self-appointment as spokesperson was rare in history, and the method he used to clear the air was completely American and very interesting. His favorite method of gaining the sympathy of reporters was to call them by their nicknames and inquire about their families. He often asked correspondents, "Hey, Jack, how are your kids?" If Jack happened to have no children, Roosevelt would say, "Well, then it's time for you to have one!" This would provoke a burst of laughter from everyone.

Holding press conferences was an important tool for Roosevelt to lead American public opinion in accordance with his political views—anti-Axis—and a springboard for his policies. The American and global newspapers were his earliest weapons in this war. Roosevelt did not use the position of spokesperson to conduct national propaganda, but only used the position of spokesperson to promote his personal political views.

A Map

In the press conferences, Roosevelt often projected the plans he wanted to realize onto the Axis countries. On one occasion, he declared that a German refugee had brought a map of Germany out of the country and into the United States. According to this map, Germany wanted to merge South America into two large countries. However, despite the urging of members of both the Senate and the House of Representatives and newspapers, Roosevelt consistently refused to make the map public, claiming that he could not make it public because he was protecting the person who brought the map out. Three days later, Berlin, based on Roosevelt's description of the map, proved that the map had been published in the American Times magazine and was a postwar map of South America idealized by the editor. Roosevelt, however, used it to project onto Germany. Whenever he encountered something unpleasant, he used a joke to lightly pass it over.

Yesterday's Drill Was Not Perfect

Yesterday was the seventh day of the blackout drill. It started at 7:00 PM with emergency regulations. At 8:30 PM, an air raid alert was issued. At 8:40 PM, all roads were blocked and traffic was prohibited. Soon after, an aircraft patrolled the sky. By 9:00 PM, the number had increased to three, patrolling the entire city. Illumination bombs were dropped in the Central and Old Zhabei districts, issuing warnings. The results were not good. The alert was not lifted until 9:35 PM, and the street lights were turned on to restore traffic.

Arson Drill and Evacuation Training

The first air raid arson drill was held yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM in the area of Yichang Road and West Suzhou Road. Members of the fire brigade, health department officials, and Japanese police officers all participated in the evacuation exercises. According to a reporter from the Datong News Agency, senior officials such as Mr. Tadai Ryosuke, director of the Public Works Department's health department, also participated in the inspection of the exercises. It is also heard that this type of drill will be conducted in other areas during the blackout. The Public Works Department Police Department, the Japanese Consulate Police Department, and the Japanese Residents' Association recently convened an air defense liaison meeting in the Residents' Association. It was decided that special evacuation training would be held during air raid alerts. The training will be conducted approximately ten minutes after the air raid alert is issued, with the aim of evacuating all citizens walking on the sidewalks and providing rescue. At that time, in addition to police officers, members of the self-defense corps and air defense teams will be responsible for various tasks.

Important Talk by Japanese Consulate Police Department

Mr. Furukawa of the Japanese Consulate Police Department gave a speech yesterday, urging Japanese residents to pay attention. He stated that although the results of the blackout training have improved, there are still many shortcomings, and some residents seem to be completely inattentive. He specifically warned all residents that those who do not pay attention will not be qualified to reside in Shanghai and appealed to Japanese residents to cooperate sincerely with the authorities.

### Subdivision Rules Must Be Observed

Many Subletters Fined

Grace, a foreign subletter at 685 Lane 5, East Seward Road, was notified by the Public Works Department to apply for a subletting license but failed to do so.

In addition, two foreign sub-letters were fined 100 yuan each by the court for the same offense. In addition, three Chinese sub-letters, Shao Yingyi, Qiu Zongyu, and Yuan Fusheng, and one foreign sub-letter, were fined between 30 and 100 yuan by the court for failing to adjust their rents in accordance with the license regulations and failing to post a list of rent payments and expenses.

### Shanghai-Hong Kong Telegrams

News of Restoration

It is heard that the Shanghai-Hong Kong telegram service has been successfully tested by the local telegraph office and is expected to resume operation in the latter half of this month. At that time, all types of telegrams can be sent and received.

### Winter Coal Supply Guaranteed

Urging Families to Purchase Early to Facilitate Coal Merchant Turnover

Okazaki, Director-General of the Public Works Department, stated that the current coal reserves in Shanghai are sufficient for the entire winter, and more coal will continue to arrive in the coming months. The public should purchase it early to prepare for winter. He made this statement not because of a coal shortage, but to avoid excessive stockpiling and to enable coal merchants to obtain funds to purchase dried coal from North China and transport it to Shanghai. He mentioned that the Public Works Department has recently increased the limit on the amount of coal that can be transported without permission, specifically to facilitate residents' transportation of coal. The Bureau has taken separate measures to ensure that sufficient coal is transported to maintain the city's industrial activities.

### Industrial Activities: Bakery Fined for Violations

A certain bakery at 1178 Jing'an Temple Road was found to be selling bread that was underweight. After being investigated by the Public Works Department's Health Department, the Special First Court sentenced it to a fine of 60 yuan on the 2nd of this month as a warning.

### Fundraising for Social Welfare Projects Must Not Be Done in the Name of the Baojia System

The French Concession authorities announced that it has recently been heard that some people intend to use donations collected in the name of the Baojia system to carry out social welfare projects such as setting up schools and providing porridge. The Baojia system is one thing, and social welfare projects are another. They cannot be mixed. Social welfare projects have their own dedicated organizations or groups responsible for them. Therefore, any projects that are not related to the Baojia system must not raise funds in the name of the Baojia system. This announcement is made to inform everyone that no one shall use the excuse of running social welfare projects to collect Baojia donations and dispose of them at will. Violators will be severely punished. This announcement is imperative.

### Re-evaluation of Properties to Establish Standard Rent

Hoping Landlords Will Charge Rent Based on the Evaluation, Housing Rents May Slightly Increase

The Shanghai Times reported that Mr. Okazaki, Director-General of the Public Works Department, told reporters yesterday (the 6th) that the issue of rent in the Public Concession will soon be resolved. The Public Works Department is currently re-evaluating the value of all properties in the concession. Based on this new valuation, it is hoped that rents for offices and residences can be adjusted. Once the valuation is completed, it will be applied uniformly to properties used by landlords for their own use or for rental.

Using Valuation as the Basis for Rent

Okazaki began his remarks by acknowledging that rent is a difficult issue and that arbitration cannot resolve it satisfactorily. The Bureau is using great effort to eliminate the bad habit of subletting. Landlords collect rent in Central Reserve Certificates (CRC) at exchange rates that range from 66% to 77%. The Bureau is trying to resolve the rent issue. The only satisfactory solution is to re-evaluate the value of all properties and use that as a concrete basis for fair rent. The heavy work of the new valuation is currently being carried out by relevant officials. It is hoped that it can be published soon. At that time, there will be no issue of exchange rates for converting rent to CRC. Although the new valuation will only serve as guidance for landlords and tenants, without a clear order to adjust rents within that range, it is hoped that property companies and private landlords will accept the Bureau's new valuation as the basis.

Rent Has Not Been High Over the Years

On average, rent based on the new valuation currently being prepared by the Bureau may be higher. Those most affected will be the residents of alleyways. However, the rent they have paid in recent years cannot be considered high. As for public housing rents, they are unlikely to increase again. In terms of law, Chinese courts do not have a definitive standard from which to judge rent disputes. Therefore, both landlords and tenants are not satisfied. However, after the new value is determined, it can be used as the basis for lawsuits, and courts will have fewer difficulties when making judgments. If landlords and tenants have a contract, neither party can unilaterally change the rent, whether it is too high or too low, because the new valuation will only take effect from the date of its announcement.

The Bureau's Goal Is Not Revenue

The Public Works Department's tax revenue may increase after the new value is determined, but the Bureau's main goal is not revenue but to provide a fair valuation of real estate value. In this regard, the first thing to consider is the issue of Chinese alleyway housing. The rent for these houses has only increased by 12% since the Chinese government issued an order in 1937. Okazaki concluded by saying that the valuation work currently underway is based on the current situation and is being completely re-evaluated.

### China and Communications Banks Absorb Idle Capital and Offer Trust Deposits

After the resumption of business, China Bank and Communications Bank are allowed to conduct trust business in accordance with regulations. The banks absorb social idle funds, use them properly in production, and increase savings. If the banks adopt a collective approach for using the deposits, the maximum misuse can be reduced, expenses can be reduced, and revenue can be increased compared to individual operations. Although the form is complicated, it is in substance no different from customers' direct investment. With the guarantee of the fund, customers can enjoy the benefits of investment without taking the risk of losses. The trust deposit accounting is completely independent and completely separated from the banks' general business. In addition to guaranteeing principal and interest, the bank will also share profits.

### Chamber of Commerce Flag Relocated to New Location

The Public Works Department's Information Office announced that the Board of Directors of the Bureau previously resolved to disband the Volunteer Corps and decided to hang the Volunteer Corps flag in a conspicuous location as a memorial. Yesterday morning (the 7th), the two flags of the Volunteer Corps were formally hung in the committee meeting room of the Bureau's Building. At that time, the Director-General of the Bureau invited approximately 30 former officers and captains of the Volunteer Corps to attend. The two flags mentioned above, one presented to the Volunteer Corps by many Shanghai Misses in 1860, and the other made by the Xujiahui Orphanage in 1922.

### Investigating Various Singing Venues

According to a reporter from the Datong News Agency, the district police department has sent personnel to various singing venues to investigate whether bookstore people are participating in singing performances.

### Adjusting Production and Consumption to Stabilize Life in Shanghai

Hoping for a Slight Increase in Prices to Encourage Production and Adjust Salaries Accordingly

Mr. Okazaki, Director-General of the Public Works Department, recently elaborated on Shanghai's price control measures and current price affairs, stating that the most important thing we should do now is to encourage production. Therefore, we are currently adjusting prices in Shanghai and the surrounding countryside.

Lower Prices in the Countryside Hinder Shanghai's Supply

The reason is that many prices in the surrounding countryside still seem to be lower than those in Shanghai. The income earned by farmers cannot buy daily necessities, so they tend to be self-sufficient and only supply their own consumption with their products. This is quite dangerous for Shanghai. Shanghai cannot live without the raw materials supplied from the interior. Therefore, we must limit the rise in prices in Shanghai and encourage production in the countryside. Our ultimate hope is to allow prices to rise gradually to stimulate production. At the same time, we will ensure that the price increase is very slow. If this is successful, we will have the opportunity to adjust salaries to cope with the gradual increase in prices without causing undue difficulties for the public. It is hoped that this new proof can solve many of the city's problems.

There Are Concrete Plans for Controlling Meat Prices

Speaking of the control of meat, vegetables, and other foods, the Public Works Department's Goods Organization Section is currently drafting a plan for this matter. The most important point is that suppliers must be attracted. If the Public Works Department can tap into the supply sources, it can completely organize its wholesale and retail, as in the case of rice. However, the Bureau has not yet been able to control the supply sources of meat and vegetables, so it is difficult to implement rapid and strict regulations. In many ways, purchasing meat and vegetables at slightly higher prices and transporting them to Shanghai is better than completely cutting off the source of these essential products. Regarding the pork that the Bureau plans to organize, the authorities will recognize some middlemen. The middlemen must agree to reduce their handling fees to slightly more than one yuan per pound. It is hoped that the market price of pork can be slightly reduced as a result. The selling price of meat can be organized to some extent, but vegetables are even more difficult because the authorities cannot set the price too low to avoid stopping the transport of vegetables to Shanghai. If the official price limit is unreasonable, the vegetables will be sold on the black market.

The Names of Violating Businesses Will Be Re-published

When the Public Works Department began implementing price control measures in mid-June, it published the names of shops and restaurants that were fined or suspended for violating the price control regulations in order to seek excessive profits. This has recently been temporarily suspended. The Bureau has now decided to re-publish the names of violators at the request of the public in order to warn customers.

### Baojia Guidance Committee Held a Meeting of Lianbao Chiefs Yesterday

### Street Children's Free School News

The Street Children's Free School on Anhe Zeng Road in this city was founded in 1920 as a completely free school. All school-age children from impoverished families who cannot afford to attend school can request free admission. The school's expenses are donated by the school board and enthusiastic people from all walks of life who care about education. Over the past four years, it has enrolled more than 200 students. As the number of applicants continues to increase, the original school building is not enough to accommodate them. Therefore, a second school building has been opened in Ningkang Lane on Fangxie Branch Road in the South City. However, due to limited funds, expansion is difficult. The school board and administrators are continuing to solicit donations from all walks of life to maintain it.

### The Truth About Zou Yunsheng's Suicide

Yesterday, we received a letter from Mrs. Zou Lu, stating that her late husband, Zou Yunsheng, was a cautious and honest man while working in Japan. After being dismissed from the French Concession Police, he partnered with a friend in the real estate business for over a decade. However, his business ventures were consistently unsuccessful, leading to significant losses. The economic situation worsened after the war. Recently, his young son suffered from a lung ailment, causing great anxiety for her husband, who deeply loved his child. Overwhelmed by both internal and external worries, he became mentally distraught and, in a fit of despair, took his own life. The report in your esteemed newspaper yesterday that he had lost tens of thousands of dollars in a gambling den in the Nanshi area may be based on hearsay and is inaccurate. We respectfully request that you publish this letter to clarify the truth for the deceased.

### The Grand Opening of Fuhua Bank

The bank did not send out invitations in advance of its opening. However, from 9:00 AM onwards, Tianjin Road in front of the bank was bustling with traffic, and the entrance was packed. Prominent figures from Shanghai and financial veterans, such as Qin Runqing, Yuan Ludeng, Wen Lanting, Wu Yunqi, and Lin Kanghou, all came to offer their congratulations. Numerous businesses opened accounts and made deposits, resulting in an overwhelming crowd. It is reported that the total number of visitors throughout the day reached over eighteen hundred.

### Brief News from Various Circles

Lu Shiqian Paints Landscapes

Among contemporary Chinese painters who deeply understand the rules and possess a profound artistic sensibility, Lu is outstanding. People know that he learned from Yuce, but in fact, he traveled thousands of miles, taking nature as his teacher, without adhering to any particular school while incorporating elements from all. Therefore, his brushwork is vigorous and his colors are rich and ancient. Recently, due to an overwhelming number of requests, he has doubled his fees since the Mid-Autumn Festival.

Business News

### Public Bonds Suddenly Surge

The unofficial off-exchange trading of public bonds suddenly surged yesterday. All bonds rose sharply by three yuan and several jiao. Trading only lasted for three quarters of an hour during the day. The highest prices were only one or two jiao away from the daily limit. This kind of surge was undoubtedly a manipulative tactic by the bulls. Types A and C were sold out at over sixty yuan. All market prices have exceeded the highest prices of September 25th and reached new records. Most of them were bulls who raised prices and sold off at the same time. Large and small financial institutions took the opportunity to unload and obtained good prices. Most of the buyers were speculators. Retail investors also traded very enthusiastically. Type C initially opened at 58 yuan and once fell to about 7 yuan. Although there were twists and turns afterward, it was eventually pushed out of the 60 yuan mark and reached a new high price of 60 yuan and 6 jiao. Type A was 60 yuan, up 3 yuan and 8 jiao. Type B was 9 yuan and 2 jiao, a high price of 9 yuan and 4 jiao, up 3 yuan and 6 jiao. Type C was 60 yuan and 1 jiao, a high price of 60 yuan and 6 jiao, up 3 yuan and 3 jiao. Type D was 7 yuan, a high price of 7 yuan and 3 jiao, continuing to rise 3 yuan and 5 yuan. Type E was 8 yuan, a high price of 8 yuan and 5 jiao, up 3 yuan and 4 jiao. However, the reaction is bound to be unfair. The total volume of forward transactions was about 3.5 million.

### Chinese Stocks Are Weak But Stable

Yesterday, the market situation of Chinese stocks mostly saw a decline. People's hearts were tired and weary, but already showing signs of stability. The cultural industry was the only one that shone brightly, and it was most favored by investment buyers. The supply was becoming increasingly scarce, so the Commercial Press stood out at 300 yuan and reached a new high price of 310 yuan, which was the same as on July 20th, and rose another 7 yuan and 5 jiao. The highest price of China Bookstore was 215 yuan, then it fell back to 200 and 210 yuan, but still rose by 1 yuan. The World Bookstore saw a high price of 77 yuan and finally settled at 75 yuan, up another 2 yuan and 5 jiao. Yongxiang Printing remained at 24 yuan and 5 jiao. Only the pharmaceutical industry declined, with Sino-French at 81 yuan, down 1 yuan and 5 jiao. New Asia remained at around 45 yuan. Minyi rose to 66 yuan, up 1 yuan. Five Continents reached 310 yuan. The textile industry unanimously weakened, which was indeed because the recent rise exceeded the par value too much. The supply exceeded the demand. The final price of Great China Weaving was 11 yuan and 5 jiao. Hongsheng was 11 yuan and 25. Shanghai Cotton Weaving was 14 yuan and 25. Fuchang was 17 yuan and 2 jiao and a half, all down a small 2 jiao and a half. Underwear was flat and weak at 5 jiao for 32 yuan. Xinfeng Weaving suffered a small setback to 13 yuan and a half. Anda Shirts suddenly dropped 1 yuan to around 25 yuan. Dasheng No. 3 Factory was between 235 yuan and 40 yuan. Yong'an Textile was around 1,600 yuan. The public utilities were in a slump. Zhabei Water and Electricity was 36 yuan and a half. Huashang Electric was 31 yuan, each down a small 5 jiao. Those who entered were watching. The department store industry was mixed, with New New Company up 5 jiao to 118 yuan as the final transaction price. Wing On was 117 yuan and a half. Guohuo was 113 yuan, down a small 2 yuan and a half to 1 yuan, with only one or two yuan high and low, and the volume of transactions was also sparse. Guangzhong Paper was 12 yuan and a half as the final price. Nanyang Tobacco was 110 yuan, without honor or disgrace. Great China Match was 205 yuan, with no transactions and little weight. Zhonglian Film was 37 yuan and 75, falling back to 36 yuan. Hanyeping was around 21 yuan, mostly seeing lower lows. The stock market table is divided and recorded below:

### Brief News from Various Industries

Large New Longan Expensive

The goods that arrived at the Fang yesterday were the first batch of large new longan. Because the market was empty, the price was very expensive, and the difference from regular goods was limited, only 100 to 200 yuan lower. More than 100 pieces were traded.

Fuhong Dates New High Price

More than two wagons of Fuhong dates arrived earlier. Because the quotation price on the market was mutually exclusive for many days, yesterday all were fully opened at a price of 320 yuan, which was 20 yuan higher than the previous price, which was also a new record.

Xianglian Rises by 20%

Recently, Xianglian has been rising in price and unwilling to lag behind. Yesterday, the market opening price also rose by two-tenths. The market followed the rise immediately, and ordinary goods also became tight, creating an unprecedented new price.

### An Unprecedented Judgment

— Lin Da

Not only does social morality change with the trends of the times, but so does the law. A hundred years ago, England had a ridiculous law that sentenced thieves to death. Such laws are obviously unreasonable and have disappeared in more enlightened places. We now laugh at unreasonable laws, and future generations will laugh at our unreasonable laws. This is certain because the law is nothing more than human sentiment, and human sentiment changes with the times.

In recent years, the American judicial system has recognized this and granted judges greater authority. In addition to fixed and rigid laws, judges may consider the actual circumstances of the island and give the offender an appropriate sentence. Therefore, we can see many new judgments that are more reasonable and realistic.

A man committed the crime of stealing bread to eat. The mayor, according to the law, sentenced him to a fine of ten dollars. Because the offender had no money, the mayor took the money out of his own pocket and then sent the police to take a hat and collect a fine of fifty cents from everyone in the audience of the court. The mayor gave these fines to the offender and let him take them home to support his family. Then he announced that someone in the city had to steal bread to eat, which showed that the residents of the city were not behaving properly and should be punished.

This kind of judgment is of course unprecedented, but it is also more reasonable. The offender who stole the bread certainly had no money to pay the fine. According to the rules, he would be imprisoned, but after being imprisoned, his problems would not be solved, and his whole family would be in a state of starvation and cold. In some places, our laws seem to be outdated.

Education

### The Auditor

— Yan Lin

It's been two weeks since school started, but we haven't had roll call once in our class. It's a good way to save some time.

But tonight (we're an evening class), the teacher made an exception to call the roll. The reason was that the school found that the number of students attending class actually exceeded the number of registered students, so they had to investigate.

We thought this could never happen, but in fact it did. It made us wonder. The result of the roll call was that there was one more student in the class than was registered. The teacher asked if anyone hadn't been called, but there was silence. So the teacher had to check each seat one by one after class. At this time, one student quietly stood up and tried to sneak out from behind the teacher. Unexpectedly, the teacher was quick-eyed and quickly turned around and stopped him, asking him what his name was and whether he had a student ID number.

"No, I'm an auditor," he answered, his face turning red.

"Then did you get permission from the school?"

"I didn't. I agreed with two classmates," his face began to turn from red to white.

"Which two classmates?" the teacher still followed closely.

He hesitated for a moment before raising his hand and drawing half a circle over everyone's heads, stammering, "They..."

We couldn't help but laugh at his somewhat funny behavior.

"How can this be allowed?" the teacher put down his face and scolded him. "If every student were like you, what would the school do?"

The bell for the first class was already ringing, and this comedy came to an end.

As we watched that pale face disappear outside the classroom, everyone sighed softly, not knowing whether it was a sign of relief or regret for his loss of an opportunity to study.

Although the teacher was still energetically lecturing on the difference between compound sentences and complex sentences in class, that pale face and the sound of his trembling voice always seemed to appear in my mind (to reward the work-study fund).

### Occasional Words

— Xiao Zi

Our life is created by our thoughts (Ariel)

The night has a thousand eyes, and the day only one; yet when the sun dies, the light of the world also dies. The mind has ten eyes, and the heart only one; yet when its love ends, the radiance of the whole life also dies (Baudelaire)

We hate certain people because we don't understand them, and because we hate them, we won't understand them (Colton)

Occupation

### Women's Way Out

— Mei Zi

When will we women be able to truly stand on our own in society by relying solely on labor? After reading Ms. Xiao Ying's article "Fresh Flowers Painted with Butter," I pondered this question in my mind for a not-so-short time.

In this gray universe, the suffering felt by women is probably many times greater than that of men.

Dancing stars, tea flower girls, singing girls, guides - these startlingly pleasing terms are all bestowed by those ferocious and terrifying men. Perhaps some people are accustomed to this kind of life of selling smiles and even enjoy it. These poor girls are influenced by the environment, their nerves are numbed, and over time they no longer consider the possibility of the emergence of such a perverted psychology.

Because a woman cannot stand on her own in society by relying solely on labor, I also worked as a dancer. However, on the day I so-called officially entered the industry, I never thought that I would escape from the guests' table. I was unwilling to sell my purity and was willing to be responsible for compensating them for the advertising costs they published for me and all the losses they suffered because of me.

After that, I worked as a typist in a customs brokerage. After that customs brokerage was dissolved due to the impact of the war, I was unemployed at home for nearly four months. In mid-April, I looked at the employment advertisements in the newspaper every day, but the result was nothing. But I have deeply recognized the so-called women's way out.

At one point, I almost wanted to try those terrible women's occupations again, but I couldn't muster the courage.

Fortunately, I was given another opportunity to join a commercial bank. Although the price I got was only enough to maintain my personal living expenses, the spiritual pleasure I gained was more than a hundred times greater, because I was already a woman standing on my own in society by relying solely on labor.

### Following "A Glimpse into the Money Business" by Yizhi Jun: A Modern Perspective on the Money Business

— Kang Sha

The Shanghai native bank (錢莊) boasts a long history and a solid foundation, enabling it to flourish and endure. Looking at the present through the lens of the past, and anticipating the future from the present, one can confidently assert that the pivotal role of the money business in Shanghai's financial market is unshakeable. Some may question its conservatism, given its long-standing status, or perceive its affluence as excessive. However, this is precisely the mark of an experienced leader—steady and prudent. It is this characteristic that earns the money business its credibility. For what the money business upholds is the essence of Chinese business ethics, not outdated practices, while embracing the spirit of the new era, not merely superficial trends. Only the money business can achieve true trust without formal agreements. As for improvements to its internal structure and the modernization of its various operations, they constantly keep pace with the progress of the times.

Recently, the "Gossip Box" column in this publication featured an article titled "A Glimpse into the Money Business" by Yizhi. Some of the points made were superficial, which might be attributed to an outsider's attempt to speak on a subject they don't fully understand. However, one particular passage was so inappropriate that it must be corrected to prevent confusion. This is the motivation for writing this piece.

Firstly, the author stated that the recent regulations require a capital of one million yuan or more. While many may fall short of this amount, the difference is insignificant when adding accumulated public reserves and term deposits. This is incorrect. Capital is invested by shareholders, while deposits are made by customers. Their natures are entirely different. How can deposits, which represent credit received, be used to supplement a capital deficit?

Secondly, the article likened the native bank's customer acquisition staff to prostitutes and portrayed their constant monitoring of indebted clients as snobbery. This depiction is unacceptable to anyone in the money business. The primary function of the native bank is to promote the credit system, and the reason the credit system can be maintained is entirely due to the staff's constant attention to customer information, which allows them to adjust accordingly. This is their duty and responsibility, and there is no snobbery involved. The native bank is not a charitable organization that can indiscriminately dispense funds, so rigorous scrutiny and assessment of clients are necessary and beyond reproach. As for acquiring customers, amiability and affability are paramount. This is a merchant's duty. As the saying goes, "Harmony breeds wealth." Well-trained employees of major companies and businesses in the West are invariably courteous and respectful to customers, doing their utmost to attract business. University business programs even list this as a required course. We cannot help but consider Mr. Yizhi's views misguided.

Furthermore, the native bank's remittance system was originally intended to resist the foreign banks' exploitation of cash, thus building a defensive wall to compensate for the lack of national protective policies. Its function is undeniable. Even in recent years, despite repeated disturbances, the market has not been alarmed, and the financing has been adequate, entirely thanks to the remittance system promoted by the native business. Yet, the author insists that even the native bank's unique remittance system previously only dealt with foreign banks, excluding newly established Chinese banks. It is unclear what evidence this is based on. Finally, the author suggests that native bank employees who lack close ties with the authorities should expect to be sidelined for years. While this may have occasionally occurred in various industries in the past, today, the native bank largely adopts a meritocratic approach. Many native banks are actively cultivating and discovering talent, so this point is also untenable.

(Editor's Note) Since the publication of Mr. Yizhi's "A Glimpse into the Money Business" in this column, we have received numerous letters from people in the money business offering corrections. We are grateful to Mr. Kang Sha for his article, which clarifies discrepancies between the original article and the facts. We are pleased to publish it to uphold fairness and extend our apologies.

### In the Same Boat Through Storms

— He Jia Zhi

(10) Flying Peak

Everyone in the house joyfully congratulated Wei Shaoyun as he entered the room. Wei Shaoyun took a step forward, turned around, and laughed, "Sister, do you have a mirror? Let me check if the cloth wrapped around my head looks alright. I'm afraid it looks bad." Nian Aying laughed, "It's not like you're really getting married. It doesn't matter. Go, go, go. The more informal it is, the more likely the first child will be a boy." Wei Shaoyun smiled and took two more steps forward, then turned around again and laughed, "You're not allowed to come in. You drink your wine. It's windy and cold outside. Drinking wine is the only way to keep warm." Little Zhuge said, "Everyone in the house is under my control. I won't let them come in. However, the old maids from the Sheng household are an exception."

Wei Shaoyun smiled, stepped through the door leading to the inner room, and closed it. He clenched his fists and walked in, step by step. After a few steps, he was outside Cui Zhen's room, where she was suffering. A light shone from the room, casting a glow on the ground outside the door. He stepped into the light and entered the room. The scenery inside was the same as during the day. As for that Bian Cui Zhen, she was lying on her side facing outwards, her eyes closed. There were no tear stains beneath her eyes, but they glistened in the light. Wei Shaoyun made his footsteps louder and laughed, "It's me, Miss Cui Zhen. Aren't you going to be mad at me?" Cui Zhen immediately opened her eyes wide. Wei Shaoyun laughed, "I heard you didn't eat dinner. This news made me so sad. How can someone not eat all day? An old saying goes, 'One day without food, one is hungry; seven days without food, one dies.' How can someone as lovely as you starve? I'm here to comfort you. I'm here to give you some comfort. You agree, don't you? Oh my, who tied you with ropes? I didn't think to tell them a word, and they've made a mess of things." Wei Shaoyun had reached the bedside as he spoke, and his hand caressed Cui Zhen's body. Cui Zhen opened her eyes even wider and shouted desperately, "You, you, you, get out!" Just as this was happening, someone jumped out from behind the curtained bed. The person arrived and the fist arrived, striking Wei Shaoyun in the chest. (197-)
