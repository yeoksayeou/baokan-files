### Japanese Control of the Strait of Malacca, Singapore's Situation Critical, Japanese Forces Advance Along the West Bank of the Muar River

Tokyo, 18th (Domei News Agency) - A dispatch from a "Nichinichi Shimbun" war correspondent at the Malayan front today states that all British airfields on the Malay Peninsula have been occupied by the Japanese army. The British defense line is less than fifty miles from the Singapore fortress. According to Japanese army aircraft reconnaissance, there are only twenty-seven British aircraft stationed at the two air force bases on Singapore Island, and no aircraft are visible at the Tengah airfield. It is reported that before the war, the British Air Force had more than 500 aircraft to defend Singapore.

Saigon, 18th (Haitong News Agency) - According to Japanese sources here, the Japanese army continued to pursue the southern part of the Malay Peninsula in a certain key area south of Gemas. After fierce fighting, they repelled a squadron of Australian troops. At the same time, most of the surrounded 45th Indian Brigade is surrendering. Part of the Japanese army has advanced along the west bank of the Muar River towards Chaah. It is said that this Indian force was ordered to cover the retreat of the British army.

Tokyo, 18th (Domei News Agency) - Japanese tanks and mechanized divisions in Malaya are now closing in on Singapore. Japanese army and navy aircraft attacked three remaining British airfields today in an attempt to annihilate the British Air Force in Malaya, and then begin a direct assault on the Singapore Island fortress. This morning, Japanese aircraft attacked Singapore at least three times. There is little news about land battles. According to the latest news received this morning, the vanguard of the mechanized forces has reached a point 58 miles from Singapore and the Johor mainland. The British Singapore Command admits that the Japanese have crossed the Muar River and defeated the Australian army.

London, 18th (Reuters) - The Singapore Gazette stated today that yesterday afternoon, after the Japanese artillery bombarded the British vanguard, the Japanese army launched an offensive east of Gemas and the battle is still ongoing. During the air raid on Singapore, some shells landed in the naval base area, and one oil depot caught fire. British fighters took off to intercept and shot down one Japanese plane. Singapore does not underestimate the new threat posed to the British left flank by the Japanese landing at Muar. The British army is still outnumbered. Unless a large force of fresh army and air force reinforcements arrive, there is always the risk of being flanked by Japanese landings along the coast, as the Japanese army now controls the Strait of Malacca.

Bangkok, 18th (Haitong News Agency) - It is learned here that well-informed sources in Singapore admitted last night that since the Japanese army crossed the Muar River, Singapore is no longer attempting to mitigate the threat to its left flank. This is because they are outnumbered, and the Japanese army now controls the Strait of Malacca. Therefore, even if the army and air force receive massive reinforcements, Singapore will still be under the flank threat of a Japanese landing. Currently, the best outcome for the Malayan war situation would be to receive another 10,000 Australian troops in aid. Japanese aircraft used incendiary bombs for the first time in an air raid on Singapore yesterday.

Canberra, 18th (Havas) - The Australian Federal Government has just received a telegram from General Bennett, strongly stating that the strength of the British Air Force in Malaya is weak and far below that of the Japanese Air Force. The Federal Government is very concerned about whether the Australian army operating in Malaya has adequate air cover, and hopes that the British Air Force will soon arrive to provide reinforcements.

Berlin, 18th (Reuters) - A German news agency reported the "Asahi Shimbun" in Tokyo reported that Lieutenant General Heath, commander of the 11th British Division in Malaya, and nine other officers were captured, but this has not been officially confirmed.

### Japanese Forces in the Philippines Fiercely Attack the Bataan Peninsula, American and Filipino Forces Resist Strongly, Dutch East Indies Continue to Be Bombed

Washington, 18th (Reuters) - According to the Department of the Army, in the Philippines, a large Japanese force, covered by aircraft and artillery, fiercely attacked the right flank of the American and Filipino forces on the Bataan Peninsula yesterday. Although the defending forces are outnumbered, they are still resisting strongly. This right flank position is twice the size of Manila Bay and is the throat of the only highway leading south directly to the Corregidor fortress at the mouth of Manila Bay.

Singapore, 17th (Reuters) - A British military communique this morning stated that Japanese aircraft bombed the Medan airfield in Sumatra, and eight Japanese bombers, protected by fighters, dropped eight bombs on an airfield on Celebes Island, but there was no damage to the airfield. The wharf on Ambon Island (east of Celebes in the Banda Sea) was also bombed and caught fire, but was quickly extinguished with minimal damage. The Japanese aircraft attacked in two batches, each of eight aircraft, flying at high altitude. Anti-aircraft guns fired fiercely near Ambon, resulting in only one civilian being killed. There is no news on the situation in Minahasa.

Former Australian Prime Minister Defends Brooke-Popham

Melbourne, 17th (Associated Press) - Former Australian Prime Minister Menzies gave a broadcast speech, stating that if there is anyone to blame for the insufficient air strength in Singapore and Malaya, Sir Brooke-Popham, former Commander-in-Chief of the British Far East Command, bears the least responsibility. When he spoke in Singapore at the beginning of last year, Brooke-Popham told me of the urgent need for air strength, especially fighters. Brooke-Popham is a brave man, and he pointed out the chaotic phenomena that our weak air strength would most likely cause. I held many meetings in London to discuss the issue of air strength in the Far East, and this issue was listed as the most serious and urgent. I have examined the facts and should assert that London military leaders were less proactive in their attitude towards the need for air strength in Singapore and Malaya than the local military authorities.

### Fighting in Southern Burma, Two Towns in the Myaungmya District Bombed

Rangoon, 18th (Reuters) - An official communique stated that in the Myittha area of ​​southern Burma, British forces have made contact with Japanese forces, and the situation is developing favorably.

Rangoon, 18th (Reuters) - Officials announced last night that Japanese aircraft bombed two towns in the Myaungmya district of southern Burma twice yesterday morning. Anti-aircraft units retaliated with fierce anti-aircraft fire.

Bangkok, 18th (Haitong News Agency) - According to British sources in Rangoon, Japanese aircraft are not only fiercely bombing military centers in Burma, but are also conducting blitzkrieg propaganda, with Japanese propaganda leaflets being dropped from the air from time to time in southern Burma.

### United War Plan, Agreement Reached at Washington Conference, Roosevelt Speaks to Reporters, British War Cabinet Reportedly to Be Reorganized

Washington, 17th (Havas) - President Roosevelt told reporters today that he was pleased that Prime Minister Churchill had safely returned to London. "We have reached complete agreement on future army and navy operations."

Washington, 18th (Reuters) - Presidential Secretary O’Leary announced yesterday that President Roosevelt and Prime Minister Churchill had reached complete agreement on the current and future army and navy plans for operations against the Axis powers in the Southwest Pacific and elsewhere. This report was announced at the same time as Prime Minister Churchill returned to London. O'Leary also stated that before returning home, Prime Minister Churchill spent about a week at a friend's house in Florida, and President Roosevelt also left Washington for a few days. As for the meeting between President Roosevelt and Prime Minister Churchill, the first meeting discussed broad policies and explained their nature. Churchill then went to Ottawa, the capital of Canada, at which time many matters were left to British and American staff to sort out in Washington. Afterwards, Prime Minister Churchill went to Florida again, and President Roosevelt also made a trip to Washington. When Prime Minister Churchill returned to Washington, the staff had sorted out the outstanding issues, and he held another staff meeting with the President, and they reached an agreement.

London, 18th (Reuters) - Prime Minister Churchill arrived here last night to a very warm welcome. According to those in political circles, although the matters agreed upon between Prime Minister Churchill and President Roosevelt in Washington do not require any personnel changes in the British government, the responsibilities of various individuals may need to be adjusted. Prime Minister Churchill has received many important proposals to supplement the Washington Agreement. The adoption of these proposals will take some time to decide. Therefore, Prime Minister Churchill will not present a full report to the House of Commons on his trip to the United States for the time being.

US Prepares for Long-Term War, Defends Position in the Far East

Washington, 17th (Havas) - Senator Connally, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, learned today that newspapers in Chongqing are deeply concerned that Britain and the United States can only offer token resistance in the Far East in order to concentrate their forces on Europe. He therefore made a statement to the press to defend against this, saying, "The United States must defend the positions of democratic countries in the Far East. We cannot allow it. We must engage in a long-term war to drive the Japanese army out of its new positions. Moreover, the result of our retreat will make it impossible to persuade the Soviet Union to provide us with base areas for our use."

### British Parliament to Meet, Debate Far East War Situation, Churchill Returns Home to Rousing Welcome, Nation Blames High Command

London, 17th (Havas) - According to Reuters, after Prime Minister Churchill returns home, the House of Commons will meet to debate the situation in the Far East. The session is scheduled for two days. Before the meeting of the House of Commons, the Prime Minister may implement a reorganization of the government. In addition, the development of war production will also be discussed.

London, 17th (Havas) - Labour MP Orwell gave a speech at a political gathering near Manchester today, saying, "The empire is about to collapse, and national affairs are deteriorating, but those key people who should be held responsible are still allowed to be leaders of the country. It is known that our country's interests in the Far East have been neglected by the government. No matter what explanation the government makes, it cannot hide this fact. We often hear government officials say that our country cannot have strong military forces in all places at the same time, but in fact there is not sufficient strength in any one place. In short, we are unprepared in all places, and therefore we are taken advantage of by the enemy."

London, 18th (Reuters) - The enthusiastic welcome given to Prime Minister Churchill on his return from the United States this time can be described as unprecedented. This trip across the Atlantic was Churchill's second since the outbreak of the war. This trip has further strengthened the bond between Britain and the United States, so Churchill's return this time can be said to be a triumphant return. However, on the other hand, when the British Parliament meets in the coming days, the atmosphere in the chamber will inevitably be volatile. Churchill must prepare to deal with this upon his return. At present, if we want to speculate on the future development of the situation, we feel that there are boundless worries. The reason for the somber atmosphere today is mainly due to the precarious situation in Singapore. Why the Japanese army in Malaya was able to drive straight in and approach Johor is something for which various parties have not received answers and cannot dispel various doubts. Sir Brooke-Popham, the former Commander-in-Chief of the Far East Command, now Lord Addison, has so far failed to provide a clear answer on this matter. Duff Cooper, the British War Cabinet's representative in the Far East, and Sir Thomas, the Governor of the Straits Settlements, are also subject to criticism from various parties. The British Minister to Thailand, Sir Crosby, was also called a "stupid minister" by King Rama VI. British government officials in the Malay Peninsula and those with rubber plantation interests in Malaya are often subjected to harsh criticism, called the "Malayan faction". Conversely, Brooke-Popham and former Australian Prime Minister Menzies have some complaints about the London High Command, believing that the opinions of the local authorities were not adopted by the High Command. The High Command's reason is that Britain must urgently transport military supplies to the Soviet Union and the Middle East, and due to the vastness of British territory, it is difficult to ensure that all places have strong strength. Combining the opinions of all parties, it can be seen that the only way to resolve the current difficulties is to increase the production of military supplies. The voices of criticism from parliamentarians are thus rising, believing that although Churchill has great talent, other members of his cabinet are still somewhat lacking in talent. Now that the country has entered a serious juncture, if we want to fight smoothly, national affairs cannot be entrusted to second-rate people. This is the conclusion of the current wave of criticism.

### Duff Cooper to Go to Washington, D.C. to Attend Military Conference

### Rich in Mineral Resources, China Can Supply the Needs of the Anti-Axis Powers, Antimony and Other Products Occupy Extremely Important Positions

Macau, 18th (Haitong News Agency) - According to confidential news received here this morning, Chongqing claims that since the tin mines in Malaya were occupied by the Japanese army, China's position as a supplier has become increasingly important. China's tin production ranks fifth in the world. The production of tungsten and antimony also occupies important positions. The tin produced in Gejiu County, Yunnan, reaches 10,000 tons per year and employs 70,000 workers. Guangxi, Hunan, Jiangxi and Guangdong also have undeveloped tin mines. According to the Ministry of Economic Affairs, mining and refining machines are being improved. In the past year, China's tungsten production reached 16,518 tons. In the eight or nine months before the outbreak of the Pacific War, a large amount of tungsten was transported from China to the United States via Hong Kong. The tungsten reserves in Jiangxi Province alone amount to 4 million tons, with an annual output of 5,000 tons. Guangdong can produce 4,000 tons annually. China's antimony production accounts for 70% of the world's total, with an annual output of approximately 20,000 tons, of which 80% comes from Hunan Province. According to Chongqing's Central Daily News, China's contribution to the anti-Axis alliance is therefore extremely valuable.

The Führer Hitler has ordered a state funeral for him, and ordered Marshal Goering and Marshal Runstedt to attend the funeral on behalf of the Marshal and the Commander-in-Chief of the Army, respectively. Reichnau's father was also a general. He was born on October 8, 1884, in Karlsruhe, Germany. In 1903, he was promoted to lieutenant. Before World War I, he received air force training and later held various positions in the staff headquarters. Due to his extensive experience, he was appointed Chief of Staff of the 1st Division of Königsberg. When the commander of that division, General Bockelberg, was appointed Chief of Army on January 30, 1933, he was also transferred to serve as Director of General Affairs. In 1935, Reichnau was appointed Commander of the 7th Army Corps in Munich and conferred the rank of lieutenant general. In 1938, he was appointed Commander-in-Chief of the 4th Army Group and led his troops into the capital of Czechoslovakia.

### A Brief History of the German Paratrooper Corps (6)

Each airborne infantry division has approximately 12,000 men, including heavy, rescue, and other personnel. Based on this number, the basic aircraft required for each division is 1,000 Junkers Ju 52 transport aircraft with three engines. All seats and other common equipment inside the aircraft have been removed. A row of benches is placed along each bulkhead, and near the door there is a large spring hook, which the paratroopers call the "musket hook." Before jumping out of the aircraft, the end of each paratrooper's parachute rope must be quickly hooked to pull it out.

Germany now has at least ten paratrooper divisions, all with ample replacements and replenishment equipment. It is noteworthy that the Junkers Ju 52 aircraft, which are already outdated and slow by American commercial aviation standards, are currently one of the three types of aircraft being mass-produced in Germany. For the other two types, they can also get extra cigarettes and cigars, which are originally issued free to every soldier in the German army. The pay of paratroopers is twice that of ordinary army soldiers; at times, the pay is doubled and higher than that of other units proportionally.

The uniforms of the German parachute troops combine the colors of the infantry and the air force, consisting of grass-grey ski pants and blue-grey jackets; the boots are thick and high to protect the ankles, and they wear a special flat-topped "diving" steel helmet. When landing in combat, a green linen upper garment and shorts with zippers are worn over the uniform to wrap the entire body, which can protect the uniform and the equipment on the body. After landing, the zipper can be opened as soon as possible to remove it. This coat is very unsightly and unstylish, or it may mislead people into thinking that German paratroopers are wearing enemy clothing. From many reasons, this is a win-win trick.

### Flat-Priced Rice Shops Will, From Today, Display the Quantity of Imported Rice Received; Rice-Buying Crowds Will Be Numbered Uniformly; Those Without Numbers Need Not Wait

Shipping is Impeded, Sources are Severed, and Rice Reserves in Warehouses are Decreasing Daily

The Shanghai Municipal Council's Rice and Grain Management Committee, in order to alleviate the suffering of ordinary people lining up and waiting to buy rice in retail, has decided to improve the retail method starting today. Five rice warehouses were opened yesterday to supply rice to rice shops. It is reported that the total amount of rice stored in the warehouses is currently about 300,000 bags, which is only enough to supply for a little over a month.

Numbered Rice Sales to be Implemented Today

The Shanghai Municipal Council's Rice and Grain Management Committee has notified all rice shops that, starting today, when selling imported rice, they should display the number of bags of imported rice allocated and received from the SMC Rice and Grain Office at their door. They should also calculate the average number of people that can be supplied for retail based on the number of bags. For example, if 30 bags of imported rice are received, and each person buys three "sheng" (升, a unit of dry volume), then over a thousand people can be supplied for retail. The constables will then use white powder to number the first one thousand people in the rice-buying crowd. The remaining people do not need to queue up and wait and can purchase rice from other rice shops. All rice shops will post such notices today. Yesterday, five warehouses, namely, Jincheng · China (supplying rice to the Hongbang North Rice Shops), Donglai · Maotai (supplying rice to the Public Concession Rice Shops), and Roosevelt (supplying rice to the French Concession Rice Shops), were still open to release rice, totaling over 3,000 bags. The transportation permits were issued last Friday. This batch of warehouse rice is for the needs of half of the rice shops (totaling 395) within the two concessions to conduct door-to-door sales today. Regarding the method of dyeing fingers, rice shops believe it is not perfect, so they have rarely used it in recent days.

Strict Regulations for Rice Allocation Levels

The Shanghai Municipal Council's Rice and Grain Office has stipulated the daily allocation quantity for rice shops in the two concessions. Among them, Xiechangde on Avenue Edward VII receives the most, with 130 bags allocated each time. Next is Tongchang on Yu Qiaqing Road, with 125 bags allocated each time. Others range from 100 bags down to 70 bags, 60 bags, 50 bags, 40 bags, 30 bags, 25 bags, and 20 bags. The grading is based on the quantity sold daily, to ensure a balanced supply. According to a Datong News Agency reporter, the Shanghai Municipal Council will also regulate miscellaneous grains such as corn. It is expected that the crowded conditions at the rice shops will improve after the implementation of the new retail method today, and the time spent queuing for rice will also be reduced.

West District Flat-Priced Rice Sales Commence Today

The West District's retail sale of imported rice at flat prices arrived a few days ago. It was suspended for one day due to the Sunday holiday. It is now known that sales will continue starting at 8:00 AM this morning. Also, the Huixing Rice Shop on Route Keymer, in the same district, is selling Shanghai Municipal Council imported rice, limited to one "dou" (斗, a unit of dry volume) per person, priced at 14 yuan per "dou." Purchases must also be made with a household registration certificate. The Jiahe Rice Shop is selling flat-priced rice, limited to three "sheng" per person, priced at 4.10 yuan. All citizens who purchase rice will have their household registration certificate stamped as a record to prevent repeat purchases. It is reported that each household is limited to one purchase per week, one "dou" each time.

Most Warehouse Flour Has Been Distributed

After the Shanghai Municipal Council's Flour Affairs Office distributed all the flour stored in the Fuxin No. 2 Factory, Fuxin No. 7 Factory, and Fufeng Factory, it opened the Donglai China Flour Warehouse. In addition to the flour in the Donglai Warehouse being completely distributed on the same day, 30% of the China Warehouse was also distributed. Besides the 60-plus bags withdrawn from the Quanxing Warehouse, the remaining flour will also be distributed in the next day or two. Therefore, other flour warehouses will be opened soon.

### Closed Bookstores to Reopen Within Days

Major bookstores in this city, such as Commercial Press, Zhonghua Book Company, Datong Book Company, and World Book Company, have been closed for many days. However, since these bookstores ceased operations, the lives of the one thousand-plus employees they hired have been in dire straits. At a time when prices are soaring and it is difficult to find enough to eat, this is indeed a serious social problem. It is now known that these bookstores posted notices of the lifting of the seals at their doors yesterday. Yesterday, these bookstores were already organizing their interiors. It is reported that all of them will be able to resume operations by the 25th.

### Restrictions on Motor Vehicle Permits Will Become More Severe; Existing Permits Expire on the 21st; Over One Hundred Fewer New Permits Will Be Issued

According to a spokesman for the Shanghai Municipal Council, most of the various motor vehicles previously allowed to operate within the Public Concession have already ceased operations since the SMC implemented restrictions. In the past, there were over 10,000 cars, trucks, buses, and motorcycles operating within the Public Concession, but currently, only eight or nine hundred of these four types of motor vehicles are permitted to operate.

Reissuing New Permits

According to the spokesman, the Shanghai Municipal Council has rejected hundreds of applications for motor vehicle operation permits. The Shanghai Municipal Council is handling this matter very seriously and has decided to further reduce the number of vehicles to conserve gasoline as much as possible and maintain necessary public transportation. The authorities of the two concessions are fully cooperating on this matter, so the restrictions they impose are applicable in both concessions. All existing motor vehicle permits will expire on the 21st of this month. No new permits will be issued before that date. The Shanghai Municipal Council carefully considers each application. The number of permits issued in the future is expected to be reduced by over one hundred. Among the existing permits, over one hundred are issued to public service providers, over two hundred are issued to medical personnel, and the rest are issued to diplomatic personnel, consulate staff, military personnel, postal workers, and others who are allowed to use motor vehicles. The Shanghai Municipal Council uses less than sixty permits. Scientific, economic, and journalistic personnel have completely failed to obtain permits. In reality, they can use the telephone as a makeshift substitute.

Abuse of Interpretation

Every permit must be presented for inspection at any time and will be thoroughly checked every month. It can be revoked if deemed unnecessary. If the Shanghai Municipal Council hears of any misuse of motor vehicles, the permit will also be revoked. When the reporter asked what constituted misuse, the spokesman replied that misuse of motor vehicles refers to using cars for pleasure trips or going to dance halls, theaters, and other entertainment venues. In other words, the use of cars must be strictly limited to necessary business matters. The reporter then asked what the Shanghai Municipal Council would do if the owner of a car with a permit gave a ride to someone else while traveling. The spokesman said that the Shanghai Municipal Council would consider the circumstances and make a decision. He implied that if a doctor wanted to drive to a certain place and his friend happened to be going the same way and rode in his car, it would not be considered misuse. The spokesman reiterated that the authorities in Shanghai were taking completely consistent action regarding the issuance of motor vehicle permits. The spokesman concluded by saying that cars running on charcoal or other alternative fuels are subject to the same restrictions and must also obtain permits. Regardless of the fuel used by the vehicle, the application for a permit must be carefully investigated. The authorities' intention is to advise the public not to use cars unnecessarily.

### Rue Lafayette Blood Case: Thief Panics After Theft Fails, Stabs Russian Woman to Death with a Sharp Blade

Around 9:00 PM the night before, a blood case occurred at the home of a Russian woman on Rue Lafayette. The victim was the Russian woman, named Emilie Tkacheva. When she returned home around 9:00 PM, she happened to find a thief burglarizing her residence. Upon entering the house, she was immediately stabbed three times in the neck with a sharp blade by the thief. At that time, the Russian woman shouted for help loudly. The alley was very quiet. Neighbors heard the shouts for help, knew something was wrong, and reported it to the police station. Soon, the constables arrived. Upon entering the room, they saw the Russian woman lying in a pool of blood, on the verge of death. At that time, the Chinese perpetrator was still inside the room, next to a washbasin, trying to wash the bloodstains off his clothes. The Chinese man suddenly saw the constables arrive and panicked, trying to escape, but was immediately arrested. The sharp blade he used for the crime was found on the floor in the pool of blood. It is said that after the thief was escorted to the police station, he confessed directly to his attempted murder. He confessed that after seeing the Russian woman leave the room, he immediately tried to sneak into the room, intending to steal as many items as possible. Unexpectedly, just as he was stealing, the Russian woman suddenly returned home. Without thinking, he grabbed a sharp blade and stabbed the Russian woman three times. As for the stabbed Russian woman, she has already been taken to the hospital for treatment. Her injuries are quite serious. One version says that the Russian woman was having an affair with a Chinese man, and the two had an argument over something, and the man stabbed his mistress to death with a sharp blade.

### Conspiring with Older Brother as Executioner, Strangling Brother-in-Law to Death with Hemp Rope; Falsely Claiming Husband Fell to His Death, Denying Murder; Interrogation to Be Conducted After Studying Physical Evidence

Wang Ximing, a clerk from Yancheng at the Hengchuntang Chinese medicine store on Binlang Road, lived at No. 3400 Nanyinghua Lane, Lubangshen Road. His older brother, Wang Xilin, was idle and addicted to drugs. He often went to Ximing's house to solicit sex from his sister-in-law, Ms. Shi (22 years old), to get money to buy heroin for smoking. On the afternoon of the 2nd of last month, while his brother Ximing was at work, he went to his house again and had sex with his sister-in-law.

Ms. Shi Held a Grudge

With the consent of her older brother, Shi Changgen (a road worker for the Shanghai Municipal Council), Wang Xilin was lured to the loft and strangled to death with hemp rope. Then, she invited her fellow townsman and used goods dealer, Wang Guozhen, to the scene to help move the body and dump it next to the trash can outside the back door. Ms. Shi then telegraphed her husband to return home, falsely claiming that her brother-in-law Xilin had fallen from the stairs while going upstairs and died. Ximing believed it and hurriedly summoned relatives and friends to find ways to assist with the funeral expenses. Unexpectedly, the matter was discovered by the police station, who sent detectives to investigate the address in detail and arrested the perpetrator Shi Changgen, the instigator Ms. Wang Shi, the accomplice Wang Guozhen, and several others.

The Murder Weapon: Hemp Rope

Two ropes were seized. They were escorted to the First Special Court and requested a postponement. The criminal Shi Changgen confessed that his younger sister, Ms. Wang Shi, hated the deceased because he often went to her house to steal small items to sell or solicit money to buy drugs for smoking. Therefore, she instructed me to trick the deceased into going upstairs, first tie his hands behind his back, and then strangle his neck with a rope. However, the instigator, Ms. Wang Shi, gave a cunning confession, only admitting that she had an argument with the deceased and denying instigating the murder. In order to thoroughly understand the truth of this case, the police station interrogated all relevant witnesses one by one. The physical evidence has not yet been studied. At yesterday's continued trial, although the police station had already filed a public prosecution against the criminals for the crime of murder, they still requested an adjournment to present the physical evidence. The court reviewed the situation and ordered a postponement for further verification.

### Detailed Account of the Fire on Rue du Consulat

At 7:20 PM the night before, a fire broke out at No. 32 Rue du Consulat, the Shenfeng Bakery. As a result, all five floors were burned down, and the fire spread to the municipal houses on Rue du Consulat. When the fire broke out, the fire brigade of the French Concession immediately dispatched twelve fire trucks to the scene to extinguish the fire. The fire was very fierce. Dozens of firefighters used fifteen hoses to do their best to extinguish the fire. After one and a half hours, the fire was finally extinguished. It was found that the fire started in the bottom floor. A large number of bread loaves were moved to the road. However, a large amount of flour, about one hundred bags, could not be moved out. Later, the fire burned from the bottom floor to the second floor, and then to the third floor's storage of miscellaneous items. When the firefighters were doing their best to rescue the flour in the shop, the fire broke through the ceiling of the third floor and completely spread to the fourth and fifth floors. The third, fourth, and fifth floors were originally residential, but all the residents escaped during the fire, and the items were also rescued as much as possible. No one was injured. The fire trucks left the scene around 10:00 PM. The losses cannot be estimated. The cause of the fire is unknown.

### Route 5 Tram Resumes Operation with Reduced Hours

According to a Datong News Agency reporter's inquiry to the Shanghai Tram Company, the newly restored Route 5 tram has its departure time delayed to after 9:00 AM and its return time advanced to 4:00 or 5:00 PM.

### I Have Fulfilled My Responsibility

— Wang Shuo

There are too many people in need of help. We have done what we should have done, to the best of our ability, based on what we know. Recently, we received two heart-wrenching letters, both requesting assistance with repatriation fees. One sender is a well-known student, and the other claims to be a struggling writer contemplating suicide. We only fulfilled the task of advocating, and the one who provided the money was an elder with noble righteousness in these turbulent times. Now, the recipients have left Shanghai and are on their respective journeys home. Amidst the desolate emotions of separation, they may have already raised new hopes of "home in sight."

Good Young Man with a Sense of Justice

A messenger brought a visiting card that was different from usual, with the reason for the visit written as "Just want to meet once, even if I die!" The guest was named Jiang Jing. That's when I realized that he was the witness in the case of the conductor pushing a passenger to his death, a St. John's Middle School student with a sense of justice. After reading the attached letter and meeting him, I immediately agreed to do my best to help him. After Jiang Jing testified in court, making the wrongdoer bow his head and admit his crime, his mother could no longer withstand the threats and hastily returned to her original home in Changzhou, leaving him alone. With the help of a certain Westerner, he was able to continue his studies in a very difficult situation. Unexpectedly, the school closed a month ago, and his supporter, the Westerner, was no longer at the original address, and he could not find him in a hurry. Later, he finally met him on Jiangxi Road. The righteous Westerner gave him 20 yuan in a hurry and told him to sell newspapers to make a living. So, every day at the entrance of the Nanjing Grand Theater, there was this student, who had been brought to distress for his sense of justice, selling "Evening News." However, as a first-time newspaper seller, he had no experience, and the profits were very small. As a result, he spent the money on food within a few days until he had not a penny left. Only then did he walk from his remote lodging place to this place. Because it was still early, the doorman told him to come back later, but he had nowhere to go and just waited. He didn't even eat dinner until it was time for dinner. A colleague saw that his clothes were thin and his face was pale and asked him what was wrong. He bought bread for him to satisfy his hunger. Jiang Jing's request was only for a train ticket back to Changzhou and pocket money for food for two days. The next day, he received the funds from an elder who did good deeds anonymously. When he handed them over, he repeatedly asked how he should repay them, which shows that although he is not yet twenty, he is very clear about things. I laughed and said, "When you have the ability to help others, you should fulfill your responsibility."

Child Author Attempting Suicide

A middle-aged man in his thirties, using the pen name Lin Yin, has been writing children's literature for more than ten years. His works have appeared in newspapers from time to time, and he has authored several children's books. He has also worked as a book editor, but because his income was meager, and with the soaring prices, he was getting poorer day by day. Until he was evicted from his home with his family after owing six months' rent and had to stay with his wife and two daughters in a small inn, he attempted to end his miserable life, first leaving home. His letter was sent after he left home. The tone of the letter was firm, and it seemed that he was determined to commit suicide. He asked us to rescue his wife and daughters from wandering and help them return to their hometown in Shaoxing. After careful visits and discussions, we sympathized very much with the tragic experience of this middle-aged woman. She said that she had visited everywhere her husband might have gone and waited anxiously in the small inn for several days without a ray of hope. She was in despair and believed that he had committed suicide. The deceased is gone, but the two daughters are still young, and the mother still has the responsibility she should bear. Her handwriting was very neat, which shows that she had received a good education. Her words made people even more respectful. We then decided to find a way to help her and her daughters return to their hometown. The funds for this journey were also donated by an anonymous elder. Now, they are on their way back home. She, who has lost her provider, still has to raise two young daughters. How heavy is this burden? Society cannot save a useful person from self-destruction, nor can it enable the widows and orphans left behind to regain their support. Although we have helped them return to their hometown, when we think about it, how much have we really done!

### Increase in Robberies

According to the Shanghai Municipal Council's crime report, there were a total of 477 criminal cases last week, a decrease of 83 cases compared to the previous week. A total of 946 people were arrested by the police last week, an increase of 297 people compared to the previous week. Of these 900-plus people, more than one-third were gambling offenders. The number of robberies increased last week compared to the previous week. There were 35 armed robberies and 28 burglaries. Fifty-nine armed robbers were arrested, and 48 burglars were also arrested. There was little activity of snatchers last week, with a total of 97 snatching cases, a decrease of 65 cases compared to the previous week. A total of 139 snatchers were arrested. There were 216 theft cases last week, a decrease of 12 cases compared to the previous week. A total of 143 thieves were arrested. There were only 22 pickpocketing cases last week, a decrease of 12 cases compared to the previous week. Sixteen pickpockets were arrested. There were very few opium smokers discovered last week, only six cases, the same as the previous week. A total of 23 people were arrested. There were four cases of gambling gatherings discovered last week, and a total of 384 gambling offenders were arrested.

New Agriculture Quarterly Published

The authors of the China New Agriculture Quarterly are all agricultural experts. The content is exquisite and practical, and it is by no means comparable to magazines that are temporarily pieced together with shoddy chapters. For example, Gu Fu's "Grain Storage," Tai Yi's "Hydroponic Cultivation of Bulbous Plants," and Huan Wen's "Alfalfa Pasture Leather" are all very valuable. The article "Research on Non-Egg-Laying Moths in Mulberry Trees" by Yin Qiusong and You Bingqing is even rarer. All the data in the full text are taken from the actual situation of the Dayou Mulberry Farm, which is famous in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces. Therefore, the article will attract great attention in the mulberry industry. There are also more than 20 other practical articles, totaling more than 100,000 words, in a thick volume with 23 openings. The retail price is 2 yuan per volume. It is published by the China Agricultural Book Company. The company also publishes other practical agricultural books. The address is No. 36 Jiaotong Road, Henan Road.

### Letter

To the Editor,

After reading your newspaper's report that Jushunhe Oil Store lost its guard and affected neighbors, it is completely inconsistent with the facts. According to the facts, the fire last night was actually started by a neighbor. Our store was just spared a false alarm. It seems that your newspaper's investigation was inaccurate. We hereby send a special letter to request correction to show the true situation.

Sincerely,
Jushunhe Oil Store
18th day

Yesterday's newspaper publishing time was 6 o'clock.

### Yuan Dan Cup Little Football Closing Match: Samsung Beat Portugal Yesterday; Wu Shaotai Scored Consecutive Goals to Secure Victory; Mighty Lions Forfeit, Lion Voice Wins Second Place

The closing match of the Yuan Dan Cup Little Football Tournament kicked off at Guangxia Middle School at 1:00 PM yesterday. The audience was unprecedented. Shanghai Municipal Council Deputy Director-General Yuan Deng and Dean of the Refugee Children's Craft Institute Xie Meisheng personally attended the scene to preside over the auction of the match ball. As a result, Gu Baoxiang, a wealthy oil and paper tycoon and philanthropist, spent 1,100 yuan, the highest price, to auction the match ball. After the match began, Little Dragon won 2-0. Little Ruitang scored 1-0 in the first half, but Little Dragon still had the advantage. In the second half, the Mighty Lions were short of players and could not play. Lion Voice won second place without any effort. In the last half, the main force Portugal had no place to use their heroes and were defeated by Samsung 2-1. In this match, goalkeeper Dong Jincai performed well and Wu Shaotai's fast scoring secured the victory. After the football match, Mountain King Ruitang gave out the prizes, and the Yuan Dan Cup came to an end. Yiguang won the championship, Lion Voice won second place, Mighty Lions were third, and Ruitang was fourth.

Battle of Three and Portugal

Kao Sitan led his troops deep into the enemy's territory. Remidi of Portal attempted to hit Samsung close to the gate, and Yue Renxiao has just recovered, unable to stop it. Fortunately, Dong Jincai's skills were agile, and he was able to turn danger into safety, thus giving Samsung a tremendous boost. Wu Shaotai went alone into the formation, and with He Jiatong's proper transportation, Shaotai fired with force at the 15-yard mark. M. Su tried hard to block the ball, but unfortunately, he was flustered, and the ball went into the net, opening the score. In less than three minutes, Portugal's Fanfan suddenly had a whim and raised a white cloth. Feng Shoupeng mistook it for a handball and was penalized a six-yard ball, which Fanfan executed and put the ball into the net at the right corner. Portugal then pulled back a goal. The first half ended, with both sides tying with one goal each.

Choosing Another Place to Fight Again

The Portugese army, led by Barada replaced Victor in the second half and Samsung replaced Yu Zhenyue with Wu Zonggui, and indeed the situation changed immediately, from stagnant to dramatic. The Portugese army was very strong, I, Lemidi, tried out their force. At five minutes, Kostan continued to steal camps and attack the gate, and Dong Jincai saved them all. At fourteen minutes, Wu Shaotai received a supply from Yu Zhenyue. The situation was not critical and they lost Jingzhou (referring to carelessness), Shaotai once again scored at the eight-yard mark. It was not long until time ended. Thus Samsung luckly won against Portugual by a score of 2-1. The results of yesterday's competition are as follows.

Little Dragon Wins Over Little Rui Tang (Exhibition): 2-0

Lion Voice Wins Over Mighty Lion (2nd Match): Forced to Give Up

Spring and Autumn

### A Wash in the Cold Current—A Promenade in Zhaofeng Park—

— Wuwei

I hopped on the Trolleybus Route 20, which was already stuffy. I barely reached into my pocket, took out thirty cents, and went straight to Zhaofeng Park.

Do I really have this kind of refined interest? Am I looking for plum blossoms in the snow? But it's such a cold day that water turns to ice—yesterday the indoor temperature was only forty-four degrees—am I really going for a hike in western Shanghai? Actually, not entirely. I just took a stroll in addition to "business."

The time was 2:00 PM. The faint winter sunlight seemed like a shy girl, always hiding. The gray-yellow grassland appeared before me. Hey! Is Zhaofeng Park really so desolate?

I asked the gentleman at the ticket office, who said that there are only twenty or thirty visitors every day! The earth is truly sparsely populated to this extent. Thinking of the grand occasion in spring and summer, I can’t help but sigh deeply!

First, I saw a baby carriage being pushed by a man in his fifties. In this desert, finding an adult and a child really made me ecstatic, and I couldn't help but follow them. After chatting, I learned that this gentleman lived nearby and was taking a stroll in the park with his child after dinner. Although the outdoor temperature had dropped to thirty-odd degrees, he still brought the child to "wash" in the cold current. I couldn't help but feel respectful and speechless.

Cutting across the completely deserted lawn, the marble pavilion stood majestically, as if saying, "I am the only one who matters." But when I looked at the two stone-carved nude women inside, in addition to the authentic graffiti such as "×× visited here," there were even a few very questionable words. Confucius said that food and sex are human nature. Seeing it is one thing.

I barely endured the loneliness along the way—the visitors I encountered were a Western couple, two single men over forty, two boys without leather shoes and coats, and a gardener in the park—on the way to the zoo, I estimated that there were less than two handfuls of people.

Undoubtedly, there were dozens of times more animals than visitors. Being alone with two or three people in the zoo felt like many animals were visiting "humans." Thinking about it was quite ridiculous.

The monkeys huddled together in twos and threes to keep warm. The little deer were too busy, bumping east and west to resist the cold. The little birds were too lazy to chirp. They probably lacked vitamins in their bodies and were not very lively. A thin layer of ice had formed on the pond where the white geese lived. Goose feathers were scattered on the ice, like sparse snowflakes, which was quite charming.

According to a wild child, the night before, someone stole a monkey late at night, skinned it, and then left the meat and bones on the ground. He said it as if it were true. Because this report is too bizarre, it is worth recording as just a rumor.

Coming out along the way, I walked through the garden and made a turn in the flower-raising greenhouse. Hundreds of pots of flowers were silently displayed on the shelves. Although there were not many bright red flowers, the room was full of jasmine and as warm as spring—the indoor temperature was seventy-two—the atmosphere was really intoxicating, as if walking into the dressing room of a newlywed bride, full of silent voices.

### Quotes

— Wenzhen

Female Worker: In the past, everyone was lazy when they started work at 5:00 AM every day. Now they get up at 3:00 AM and line up in front of the rice shop, waiting until after 8:00 AM to buy rice, but their spirits are not bad.

Cooking Steward: The Public Works Department's plan for several families to cook together has a great impact on our livelihood.

Second Landlord: I haven't been stern with my tenants lately, but they all say they want to return to their hometowns and are asking to cancel their leases!

Family Weekly Notice: Due to space limitations today, the Family Weekly will be suspended for one issue. It will be published as usual next Monday. We hope readers will understand.

Humans are Not as Good as Dogs

In a classified advertisement in this newspaper, there was a lost dog advertisement with a reward of one hundred and fifty yuan, occupying seventeen lines, and even publishing a copperplate of the "Dog Gentleman's" portrait, which was very eye-catching. But its neighbor had a missing person advertisement, cramped in only four lines. There was no reward for finding the person, only the four words "Gratitude like Rebirth."

### Uneven Cold and Heat

Local News: "According to a Sydney wireless message, a heat wave is sweeping Australia, causing one hundred deaths." But on the isolated island, during the severe cold a few days ago, over five hundred corpses were found frozen to death overnight. It is truly an uneven distribution of cold and heat.

Amusement Miscellany

### Weiqi (Go)

— Zefu

Before the Han Dynasty, Weiqi was only called Yi. It was only after the Han Dynasty that it was called Weiqi. It is said that this game was created by Emperor Yao to teach his son Danzhu; it is also said that it began with Emperor Shun because his son Shangjun was foolish, so he created Weiqi to teach him. This game has been passed down through the ages and continues to this day. However, it was most popular during the Six Dynasties. At that time, from emperors to commoners, everyone regarded Weiqi as their only entertainment. In some cases, there were even good stories of borrowing chess pieces during wars between countries, as recorded in the Biography of Zhang Chang in the Book of Song. Emperor Taiwu of the Later Wei Dynasty invaded the south and stationed his troops in Xuzhou. He sent an envoy to Emperor Xiaowu of the Song Dynasty, saying, "I will not attack this city. Now I sit idly, do you have any chess pieces to lend me?" Xiaowu then sent them to him. In the Jin Dynasty, there was also a distinction in chess quality, just like official ranks were divided into nine grades. At that time, Weiqi also had various other names. Wang Tanzhi regarded it as "sitting in seclusion," Zhi Dun regarded it as "hand talk," the Record of Strange Things has the saying "rotten axe handle" (referring to the story of Wang Zhi of the Jin Dynasty entering the mountains to chop wood and seeing children playing chess. In a moment, Zhi came out, and the axe handle was completely rotten), Zu Na had the saying "forgetting worries" (referring to chess to forget worries), and Wang Anshi of the Song Dynasty also called it "wooden fox," because it can bewilder people like a fox. As for the format of the game, in ancient times, there were seventeen vertical and horizontal lines; in the Tang Dynasty, it was increased to nineteen lines. This format has not changed to this day.

Sixteen: The Fire of Youth

Unexpectedly, the young man shook his head even more violently.

"Shaohua, don't be stubborn! You are still a student and haven't earned half a penny yourself. Spending two or three hundred yuan in twenty-odd days, isn't that a lot?" Xiangqi said forcefully.

This time Shaohua stopped shaking his head, but remained silent, not saying a word.

Xiangqi's eyes circled the room, and then she sighed deeply.

"When your father and I were young, where could we have had such comfort?" She stood up from the chair and started to walk out. "Child, stay at home and review your lessons properly!"

She had already reached the door frame when suddenly, Shaohua chased after her from behind.

"Aunt," he choked, and at the same time knelt straight down on the floor. "Can you help me this once?"

Xiangqi turned her head in extreme surprise, discovering that Shaohua's face was already covered with tears.

"What! Do you still owe someone money?"

"No, aunt," Shaohua quickly opened his hands and grabbed the corner of Xiangqi's clothes. "I'm asking you to tell my father that you'll allow me to go out once more tonight..."

Xiangqi looked at his fervent and sorrowful state and really couldn't guess what was going on.

"Get up and talk. Wouldn't it be ridiculous for the servants to see you like this?" She casually closed the door a little.

"Aunt, then will you finally allow me to tell you?" Shaohua opened his tearful eyes wide and slowly stood up from the ground.

"Then you must tell me the truth first!"

Shaohua hesitated for only about a minute before nodding his head very resolutely.

"Aunt, I met a singing girl, —"

"Hmph, how can there be good women like that?" Xiangqi retorted angrily before Shaohua could finish speaking. (308)
