New York, 26th (Havas) – Eastern Coastal Defense Commander Lieutenant General Drum has declared that the Atlantic coast, from the Canadian border to Florida, is now designated as a military zone. This is to implement military control, prevent destructive actions, and hinder enemy activities. The management will be carried out through a district system, with restrictions placed on army, navy, and commercial facilities within each district if required for national defense and security, to prevent accidents. Furthermore, the defense headquarters will issue orders at any time to restrain the actions of foreigners and those deemed to endanger national security, but there is no plan to大規模 evacuate enemy aliens from the area.

New York, 17th (Reuters) – Lieutenant General Drum, Commander of the Eastern Defense Zone and the First Army Corps, announced that military authorities will establish an Eastern Military Control Zone along the entire Atlantic coast from Maine to Florida.

Military authorities have announced that it is not necessary to evacuate all enemy aliens from the zone, but some individuals will be designated for forced evacuation. The purpose of establishing the military control zone is to prevent conspiratorial activities and aid to the enemy. The headquarters of the four U.S. military districts are located in Boston, New York, Baltimore, and Atlanta.

### US Troops Occupy French Island; Vichy Lodges Protest; de Gaulle Expresses Welcome; Future of Madagascar Worth Watching

Vichy, 26th (Havas) – After the landing of US troops on the French island of New Caledonia in the South Pacific, the French government, while acknowledging that the island is currently under the control of French dissidents, insists that France has never relinquished its territorial sovereignty. Therefore, the US military's unauthorized landing has prompted the French government to instruct its ambassador to the US, Henry-Haye, to lodge a strong protest with the US government.

London, 27th (Reuters) – After the US military occupied French New Caledonia in the Pacific, General de Gaulle telegraphed Major General Patch, the commander of the US forces, expressing welcome for the joint defense of the island by the US military and the Free French forces. Major General Patch has also telegraphed back, expressing his delight.

Bern, 26th (Havas) – Local newspapers recently reported that the severance of diplomatic relations between the Union of South Africa and France could create a problem for French Madagascar. The island is located east of Portuguese Mozambique, near the Union of South Africa, and in the southwestern Indian Ocean, making it strategically important. German political figures, noting that the Mediterranean Sea and the Suez Canal have lost their value as safe lines of communication, are paying close attention to French Madagascar, which effectively controls the route from Europe to India and Australia. They also believe that the severance of relations between the Union of South Africa and France could promote the development of war in the Indian Ocean, which could determine the fate of the British Empire. The Union of South Africa's decision to sever diplomatic relations with France can be seen as a preliminary step towards an attack on Madagascar. However, France has a fleet stationed on the island, and French authorities have taken precautions, potentially sending warships from Toulon to reinforce the defense. London is also very concerned about French Madagascar. According to sources in the capital of the Union of South Africa, it is not impossible for the Union to attempt to occupy French Madagascar, but officials in both Britain and Germany have declined to comment on the matter.

Vichy, 27th (Havas) – Foreign radio stations have issued misleading reports with ulterior motives, exaggerating the situation on the French island of Madagascar in the Indian Ocean. The French Information Bureau today officially stated that the situation on the island is calm and normal, and the rumors are entirely unfounded.

### Japan's Wartime Financial Situation: People's Burden Increases

### Canada to Decide on Overseas Deployment of Troops via Plebiscite

Ottawa, 26th (Havas) – A plebiscite will be held in Canada tomorrow regarding the lifting of the federal government's restriction on sending conscripts to fight abroad. Women will also be able to vote. Voters simply need to write "Yes" or "No" in response to the question: "Do you agree to lift the various restrictions imposed on the government regarding conscription?" The governing party is actively campaigning, urging the public to accept the government's proposal. Prime Minister Mackenzie King has even announced that if the government's proposal is rejected, the cabinet will resign, stating that until now, only volunteers could go overseas to fight, while conscripts could not leave the country. By holding this plebiscite, the government deeply hopes that the people will understand the needs of the overall situation and grant the government the power to act freely to deal with various issues that may arise from the war in the future. Opposition parties such as the Conservative Party and the Social Credit Party initially opposed holding a plebiscite, but have now changed their attitude to support the government, urging party members to vote in favor of the Prime Minister's proposal.

### White House Calls Meeting of Congressional Leaders; Important Meeting to Discuss Anti-Inflation Policy; Treasury to Begin Bond Drive

Washington, 26th (Havas) – President Roosevelt is scheduled to convene an important meeting with congressional leaders at the White House tomorrow to discuss the message that the President plans to submit to Congress.

The Treasury Department is scheduled to begin a fundraising campaign on the 28th of this month, requiring all American citizens with fixed incomes to purchase government bonds with 10/10000 of their income. According to the observations of prominent American economists, this is the most effective way to absorb currency and will greatly benefit the government's anti-inflation policy.

### 9. Temples and Architecture of India (Part 2)

The Sanchi Stupa is the oldest and most famous stupa in India. Its construction date is difficult to determine, but it is said to have been built in the second half of the second century BC. According to legend, King Ashoka ruled 84,000 countries and ordered all countries to build 84,000 temples and 84,000 stupas, of which the Sanchi Stupa is one. In addition to the Great Stupa, there is also a group of smaller stupas, which are said to be the stupas of Shakyamuni Buddha (釋尊) and the Great Disciples Mahākāśyapa (大迦葉), Maudgalyāyana (目犍連), etc. The Great Stupa has the oldest style, entirely built of bricks, forming a semi-circular hemispherical shape, resembling our country's hills from a distance. Below it is a base, forming a single-level circumambulation path. The diameter including the base is 120 feet, the diameter of the stupa body alone is about 100 feet, and the height from the ground to the chattras (承露盤) is about 56 feet. The top of the semi-circular stupa body originally had a T-shaped finial as decoration, but it was lost at some unknown time, and the Indian government has specially reconfigured it. The stupa is surrounded by stone gates and stone railings, with exquisite carvings and old styles, which are also the object of keen discussion by researchers. According to China's paifang (牌坊), it is a transformation of this type of stone gate. Other famous Buddhist sites, such as the Ajanta cave temples, are famous throughout the world for their sculptures and murals, and the Sigiriya cave temples in Ceylon (Sri Lanka), and the Kutai cave temples, etc., are either famous for their murals or known for their statues, which are difficult to describe in detail.

Architecture of Hinduism

Hindu art arose after Buddhist art, so it mostly followed Buddhism, and its buildings were also the same. Hindu buildings were once mistaken for Buddhist relics. After Buddhism was oppressed by Islam and driven out of the Indian mainland, this newly emerging Hinduism was preserved as the representative of the Indian national faith. The longest Hindu artworks are from the sixth century, and subsequent buildings, sculptures, etc., continued until today, and some are still being made. Regarding Hindu art, the first to mention is the Ellora cave temples below cave number 29, followed by the Benares (培那來史) area, known as the City of Gods (神都), where Hindu temples are lined up along the Ganges River. Also, the Konark Sun Temple (黑塔寺) in Bengal, the magnificence of its construction, and the strangeness of its carvings, leave visitors speechless. There are many others that cannot be listed one by one. The gods enshrined in these shrines are mainly Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva, supplemented by the incarnations of the main gods and their consorts and retinues. The temple wall carvings and paintings are mostly myths and legends about the power and virtue of the gods. Although the construction and carving of this type of temple are becoming more and more refined in terms of technique, they cannot be compared with the solemn spirit of Buddhist art. For example, the structure of the Black Pagoda Temple Hall and the wonderful carvings are far superior to ancient times, but the countless images of men and women meeting are inevitably obscene and vulgar. Since the faith has degenerated, at the same time, the art must also degenerate, which is undeniable.

Periodization and Characteristics of Indian Architecture

Those who discuss the history of Indian art often regard the period from ancient times to the Gupta Dynasty (多朝) as the first period, considering it the developmental stage; the Maurya Dynasty (多朝) is called the middle period, and is considered the mature stage; and after the Gupta Dynasty (多朝), it is considered the later period, which is the declining stage. In fact, this kind of periodization and criticism is not reliable. The works in the so-called developmental stage, even assuming that they lack mature skills, are by no means inferior to the heyday of the Gupta Dynasty (　　多朝) in terms of their sincere and enthusiastic spirit.

The most distinctive feature of Indian architecture is the temple tower. The temple tower was originally semi-circular and was an independent building with stone gates and stone railings. Later, it gradually became the center of the temple, and sometimes a sangharama (伽藍) was built. The most different thing between Indian architecture and European architecture is the structure of the dome. The lintels of Indian domes are all horizontal, and there are also brackets (腕材) protruding from the capitals of the pillars on both sides, while European domes are constructed with radiating arch stones. Indian brackets are unique to its architectural essentials. Researchers in the world say that they originated from the Dravidians. As for the influence of Indian architecture on the world, it is based on the Buddhist region, and especially China is most influenced. Pagodas, temples, and even grottoes are not exactly the same as Indian stupas, Indian temples, and Indian grottoes, but their source is India. Therefore, no matter how much they are changed, the image of Indian architecture cannot be removed.

Bombay Prepares for War

With the Indian Ocean war looming, these days seem even heavier. Since the capital of Ceylon, Colombo, and India's third largest city, Madras, were bombed, the coastal cities of India must be prepared for the worst, evacuating the population and carrying out necessary arrangements. In the seaboard of western India, occupying 22 square miles, there is the city of Bombay, consisting of seven islands linked together. It is not an exception; it is said that the population evacuation is also being done in these days. No one believed that this city was originally named King Charles Ⅱ in 1666 and was obtained by renting it for ten pounds.

### German Troops Prepare to Attack, War is Not Far Off, Local Warfare Intensifies Daily, Murmansk Port Continues to be Bombed

### US Business Circles Strongly Advocate Developing Inland Waterway Transportation to Avoid Coastal Navigation Hazards Due to Active Axis Submarines

Washington, 26th (Havas) - As the number of American merchant ships sunk by Axis submarines along the Atlantic coast increases daily, various parties are calling for the immediate development of inland waterway transportation to avoid the dangers of coastal navigation. It has been thirty-five years since American business circles demanded the dredging of domestic canals and the increase in inland riverboats, but without success. Now, they all believe that the transportation of heavy goods cannot solely rely on coastal shipping and that more canals should be built to ensure better transportation between the eastern coastal areas and the Midwest, South, and Southwest. The initial work includes: adjusting canal equipment, building a large number of barges, laying oil pipelines, and opening a new canal across Florida to transport crude oil produced in Texas to the north. In addition, the Midwestern states have always transported all goods via mountain railways, resulting in high freight costs, which are significantly higher than the low freight costs for goods transported by coastal shipping in the eastern coastal states. Therefore, they also strongly support the development of inland waterway transportation.

Washington, 26th (Havas) - According to the Navy Department, an American merchant ship of ordinary tonnage was sunk by enemy torpedoes near the Atlantic coast. There were no casualties, and all the sailors have landed in a port in the east.

### North African Front: Sandstorms and Heatwaves, Only Skirmishes and Artillery Exchanges

Berlin, 27th (Haitong) - The German High Command announced yesterday that the war in North Africa is currently limited to artillery exchanges and reconnaissance activities due to the desert heat and sandstorms.

Outposts had contact with enemy forces, and British troops, protected by tanks, were defeated by our artillery fire. Transportation in North Africa is unimpeded due to the protection of the German and Italian air and naval forces.

### France Establishes Special Bureau to Collect Waste

Vichy, 26th (Havas) - Due to the impact of the war and the scarcity of raw materials, French manufacturers have had to use substitutes and waste to compensate. France had already produced some substitutes before the outbreak of the war, such as rayon and artificial leather. However, due to the abundance of raw materials at the time, this industry was not very developed. After the signing of the armistice agreement between France and Germany, the government began to encourage people to manufacture substitutes, such as artificial fuel, coal gas, artificial fiber coke, wood gas, and artificial paint. However, the country still felt a shortage of materials. To remedy this situation, the authorities have established a special bureau dedicated to collecting discarded waste nationwide. However, there are still many difficulties in getting people to understand that this is the most economical way to obtain raw materials. Therefore, the work can be divided into the following aspects: establishing waste trading organizations, researching the goods that can be manufactured from waste and classifying them, compiling waste markets, and disseminating the economic concept of waste utilization to the public through propaganda channels. In 1941, a total of 700,000 tons of rags and 138,000 tons of waste paper were collected nationwide and used to manufacture white paper, accounting for 18% of the total paper production. From April to December of last year, a total of 1,550 tons of discarded rubber and 85 tons of hair were collected. Also, from June to December of last year, French factories used 9,500 tons of waste bones.

### Full Text of Hitler's Speech

Berlin, 27th (Haitong) - After General Göring announced the opening of the German Parliament at 3:08 PM yesterday, Führer Hitler delivered the following speech: "Germany was forced to go to war in September 1939. The world is now beginning to understand the truth about the causes of the bloody war. On September 3rd of that year, Britain and France, disregarding Germany's efforts to maintain peace, declared war on Germany, creating today's catastrophe for mankind. To this day, I do not know whether the British government's repeated rejection of my proposals for establishing understanding after 1933 was a wise decision. Bolsheviks have the ambition to redden the world. Therefore, Germans are determined to destroy the Red Army."

Boasting of War Achievements

"After the winter, the German military posture on the Eastern Front has become more stable. Since the Spanish Civil War, the crisis of Bolshevism has alerted European youth. Therefore, the Soviet Union's attempt to profit from this war has now been thwarted by Germany, Italy, and Hungary. The Jewish capitalist democracies are now fighting alongside the Soviet Union, aiming to protect their power to exploit humanity. However, oppressed nations are now united and fighting for freedom and independence to solve the bread and butter issues of the people. The outcome of this war will be decided on the Eastern Front. Germany has repeatedly achieved astonishing victories in this war. Poland, Norway, the Netherlands, Belgium, and France have been conquered by our troops. In North Africa, Italian and German troops are fighting side by side. The rebellion in Serbia has also been quelled by our troops. British troops in Greece, after being severely attacked by our troops, collapsed and retreated. The Soviet Union's attempt to threaten the German border has also failed. Enemy ships sunk to date amount to more than sixteen million tons. All this has already shocked the world. Now, the heroic Japan is making victorious progress in East Asia."

Arduous Warfare

"On the Eastern Front, our troops were unable to fight due to the severe cold weather, and had to switch to a defensive posture, taking this opportunity to replenish our strength to await the decisive battle in the spring. In 1812, Napoleon advanced into Moscow but ultimately perished due to the severe cold. The lowest temperature at that time was 25 degrees below freezing. Last winter, the lowest temperature on the Eastern Front was 52 degrees below freezing. From this, we can understand the hardship of the German soldiers on the Eastern Front. Finnish troops are fighting side by side with our troops to defend against the Red Peril and have made outstanding achievements. Their confidence in victory has not wavered and is worthy of our respect. The Spanish Legion is also sharing hardships with our troops on the front lines. Our admiration for them is beyond measure. Other legions, such as those from Hungary, Slovakia, and Croatia, have also endured hardship and fulfilled the great mission of liberating the world. Italian troops have also been able to defend their positions on the Eastern Front and thwart the Soviet offensive. The heroism of the Romanian Legion is also admired by all of us. From this, we can see that we have united with the European nations and are determined to destroy the Soviet Union's threat to redden the world and to seek the safety of mankind together."

Demanding Special Privileges

"European nations are working together to fight a common enemy. German stormtroopers and troops from France, Belgium, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, and Ukraine are participating in the war against the Bolsheviks. The air forces of Finland and Italy have also severely damaged enemy forces. I use the power given to me by the German people to make important decisions. I and all the soldiers express our gratitude for the support of the people of the whole country. The hardship of the front lines is a lesson for us. I will take all necessary measures to prevent this hardship from happening again. This winter, the German army will have better railways, locomotives, tanks, trailers, and trucks. You should not doubt my determination. I hope that the German people will give me the power to demand absolute obedience from the people in order to complete a greater mission. Both the front lines and the rear must obey the sole principle of striving for victory. At present, no individual can insist on various privileges. Everyone should recognize that there is only responsibility at present. I ask the German Parliament to clearly stipulate that I have the legal power to make anyone fulfill their responsibilities and to punish those who do not fulfill their responsibilities. The exercise of this power only involves a small number of the millions of people. The soldiers on the front lines and the workers in the rear are asking for leave, and I have the right to refuse them because I have not had three days of vacation since 1933. Winter has passed, and the stalemate on the Eastern Front will end. History will determine who is the victor of the winter battles."

Naval and Air Warfare

"Hitler then elaborated on the methods of air warfare and submarine warfare, stating, 'I am not afraid of the generals of Britain and the United States. However, if Britain intends to continue engaging in air warfare and poisoning civilians with new weapons, I must explain my attitude towards air warfare at this time. Churchill himself was the instigator of the air war. He first launched an air raid in May 1940, but at that time, I only gave him a warning and waited for him to come to his senses for four months. In the end, because he was obsessed, I had to take action. As a result, the person who started the air war was greatly panicked. At this moment, I am willing to be patient again to see his future actions. However, this attitude is not a sign of weakness. I must warn this person not to be willful and cause panic again. He has forced me to take retaliatory measures, which only cause great suffering to his people. From now on, I will retaliate until this kind of crime disappears. This work will end at the same time as him. Moreover, I have great faith in the future. The war on the Eastern Front will continue until the Soviet behemoth is destroyed. At the same time, we must continue to fight Britain with submarines. In the autumn of 1939, Churchill gave a speech to the British people, saying that the threat of submarines had been conquered. In fact, I dare to say at this moment that submarines will still force Britain to surrender, no matter what Churchill says. I can guarantee to you that we have a large number of submarines, more than in the last World War. In fact, we have all the conditions needed to win. If we unfortunately fail, our nation will come to an end, and barbarism will prevail in Europe, no different from Europe before the fifteenth century. The German soldiers know this best. Britain will gain nothing in the current war and may even lose everything. In the end, it will be clear that the destiny of the nation-state cannot be entrusted to bureaucrats. Truth will prevail, and truth is on our side. At this greatest moment in our country's history, I am proud to lead the German nation in a common struggle. I am willing to unconditionally link Nai's name and life with the fate of the people. I have no other request to God but to bless our descendants. However, I still hope that God can give me the years to wait for the completion of the struggle of our nation.' (Havas)"

Göring's Speech Encourages the People

Berlin, 16th (Wahas) - The House of Representatives convened this afternoon. First, Führer Hitler delivered a speech, reiterating his determination to fight the Soviet Union (see previous telegram). Next, Speaker and Minister of Aviation General Göring spoke, asking all Germans to be loyal to the Führer, stating, "Each meeting of this House occupies an important page in the history of the German nation. Whenever the German nation is at the transition between the old and new stages of life, the Führer must convene this House to explain to the people the reasons for taking certain actions. In this session, the Führer has reported to the people on the winter war situation. Winter was a great crisis for the German nation, and the people deeply felt the existence of this crisis, but they still firmly believed in the Führer. The prosperity of the people in the rear can be compared with the heroic spirit of the soldiers on the front lines. The Führer has thanked the soldiers on the Soviet front lines, but I deeply believe that the people will be able to fully recognize who led us through this crisis. There has never been a nation in the world that is so sincerely grateful to its Führer. Those of us who work under his leadership know how much hardship the Führer has endured to save the motherland. We can now publicly declare that the reason why our country can hold the Eastern Front and launch a great offensive is due to the Führer alone. Now that the difficult situation has passed, I may as well mention how great the Führer needed to be in order to solve the new problems that arose every day in the past. The Führer personally planned various measures to increase the number of trains running to the Eastern Front every day and drafted various combat plans to allow our army to calmly deploy and wait for an opportunity to move. In short, the Führer has foresight on everything. Since last winter, our soldiers and civilians have greatly increased their confidence in the Führer. We are now fighting a battle for the survival of the nation. The Führer must obtain all the power necessary for the final victory. He holds the three positions of Führer of the German nation, Commander-in-Chief of the Army, Navy and Air Force, and Head of Government, and can require every soldier and citizen to do their duty to the end. He does not need to accept the restrictions of the court or law and can implement punishment. In short, we must remove all administrative restrictions on him. Members of Parliament, you are representatives of the German nation, and I now ask you to prove by standing up that the Führer has been granted all the rights he has requested by the entire people." At this point, the members of the court stood up to show their approval. Göring then addressed the Führer, saying, "Führer, you have overcome the difficulties of winter, the most difficult season we have experienced. The national army and people respectfully stand before you, ready to continue fighting under your leadership and overcome any obstacles. The army awaits your orders, and the weather has now improved. Our army is eager to be ready and brave to make contributions. Our army, navy, and air force are eager to fight under your wise leadership to achieve a historically unprecedented victory."

Italian Newspaper Observation

Rome, 27th (Haitong) - Roman newspapers published Hitler's speech in a prominent position, believing that Hitler hinted at the possibility of launching an offensive in the near future. Most newspapers discussed the new powers granted to Führer Hitler by the German Parliament. The Roman People's Daily pointed out that Führer Hitler's personal speech in Congress always had a major impact.

### Municipal Council Tries to Increase Number of Rice Shops, No Sign of Changes in Purchase Limits

The Municipal Council had previously announced that 397 rice shops were permitted to operate in the two concessions. However, recently, 25 rice shops have had their licenses revoked by the Municipal Council for violations or have voluntarily closed down. Therefore, the number of rice shops actually operating is currently 372. Yesterday, the Datong News Agency reporter learned that the Municipal Council is trying to increase the number of rice shops to make it easier for the public and reduce difficulties in purchasing rice.

Receiving Tickets to Transport Rice

Yesterday, rice shops in the two concessions received tickets for corn from the Municipal Council's Rice and Grain Management Committee. After paying the Rice and Grain Office, they can start transporting corn from Laihe Warehouse at 195 Suzhou Road today for sale in the county on Friday. The transportation permits issued by the Municipal Council's Rice and Grain Office last Saturday, designating the transportation of foreign rice from Jardine Matheson Wharf on Yangshupu Road and Swire Warehouse on the French Concession Bund, were not completed on Sunday and will continue to be transported today. The transportation of this batch of rice from the warehouses can be completed today. The situation for transportation on Wednesday (tomorrow) can be trending towards universality.

Restrictions Remain

As for the restrictions on the quantity of rice transported, the Datong News Agency reporter learned that the limit for foreign rice remains at one sheng per person, and the limit for corn remains at one and a half sheng. There are no signs of increasing the quantity, but there is an increase in the number of rice shops. To prevent accidents, the police force has dispatched more patrol officers to maintain order when rice shops transport foreign rice these days.

### Short Weights in Sales Result in Fines

With only four days remaining until the licensing deadline, second landlords who have not yet obtained their licenses should not take this final opportunity lightly. It is understood that the department will strictly punish second landlords who fail to obtain licenses before the deadline.

Increased Issuance in Recent Days

According to a report by the Datong News Agency, the daily number of licenses issued by the Public Works Department's Tax Division and various district offices in the Northwest and East, in addition to those previously announced, were as follows: On the 23rd, 345 licenses were issued in the Central District, 646 in the Western District, 1,256 in the Northern District, and 394 in the Eastern District, totaling 1,735.

On the 25th, 236 licenses were issued in the Central District, 209 in the Western District, 186 in the Northern District, and 277 in the Eastern District, totaling 998.

### A Burglar Who Escaped from Prison Five Years Ago Falls Back into the Net

Wang Agen, a notorious burglar from Hangzhou, aged 54, was arrested by the French Concession Police five years ago for numerous theft offenses and sent to the Special Second Court for trial. Unexpectedly, before the trial began, Wang took advantage of the carelessness of Judicial Police Officer No. 55 and escaped from custody while awaiting trial, disappearing without a trace. The police officer was subsequently dismissed from his post for negligence. It was unexpected that after Wang escaped, he roamed free and resorted to fraud to make a living for five years, until yesterday at 11:30 AM when Wang attempted to extort money from a business at 489 Avenue Joffre. He was reported, arrested, and during interrogation at the police station, it was discovered that the accused was an escaped prisoner.

### Methods for Paying Taxes in the French Concession in Legal Tender to End This Month; Prepayment of Donations Also Accepted in Legal Tender

According to the English-language North China Daily Mail, the French Municipal Council stated yesterday morning that residents of the French Concession who pay land rent in legal tender must pay their first-quarter land tax before this Thursday (the 30th) to avoid economic hardship after switching to paying taxes in Central Reserve Bank notes. There will be no exchange rate discount for first-quarter land tax payments made after April 30th. This discount is a benefit offered by the authorities to residents of the French Concession to avoid economic losses. The method is that when residents pay taxes, they can pay in legal tender at face value, without having to pay a cent more due to the difference between legal tender and Central Reserve Bank notes. However, this discount does not apply to residents who pay land rent in Central Reserve Bank notes. The deadline for this method is the 30th of this month. Those who have not paid their first-quarter land tax by the deadline will not be able to enjoy the discount, and all future land rent payments in legal tender will also have to be paid in Central Reserve Bank notes. The discount will still be available for prepayment of the second-quarter land tax, but only if prepaid before the end of the month.

### Apprentice Dies Suddenly After Milling Rice

Xu Zhanghu, a 14-year-old apprentice from Ningbo working at the Taixing Palm Mattress Shop at 265 Rue Foch, was instructed by his master, Yang Jinfu, on the afternoon of the 25th to mill rice at the Yongtai Rice Shop at 119 Avenue Haig. At 5:00 PM, on his way back to the shop, he suddenly collapsed in front of number 48 Avenue Haig. A patrolman from number 595 recognized him and took him to Guangci Hospital for treatment, but he died at 11:15 PM that night. The police transported the body to the morgue for examination. Yesterday, his master claimed the body for burial. His master, Yang Jinfu (37 years old, from Pudong), told people that Xu Zhanghu's death should be thoroughly investigated to determine if it was caused by injuries sustained while milling rice, or if he was beaten or harmed by someone, resulting in his tragic death.

### Warehouse Workers Collude with Rice Shop to Steal and Sell Rice Intended for the Police; Chinese Detectives and Staff at the Gordon Road Police Station Have Eleven Batches of Rice Stolen and Sold; Head Detective Discovers the Theft

Each week, all Chinese detectives and staff at the Gordon Road Police Station are entitled to purchase rice at a discounted price of five yuan and ten cents per person, limited to three liters. They must first obtain a rice ticket from the Western staff member in the office who manages the food supply.

Rice Tickets Required for Collection

Every day from 3:00 PM, workers from the rice warehouse, Zhu Peizhu, Zhu Peiyao, and Cai Mingyao, all from Jiangbei, and the deliverymen from a certain rice shop who deliver this discounted foreign rice every week, Hou Xiangquan and Zhu Chenglin, both locals, are responsible for measuring and distributing the rice to the ticket-holders among the Chinese detectives and staff. However, the workers Zhu Peizhu and others colluded with the rice shop deliverymen Hou Xiangquan and Zhu Chenglin to embezzle and sell the rice for personal gain, escaping punishment. This was essentially a case of those guarding the store stealing from themselves. Recently, Chinese head detectives Cao Zhide and Zhu Yongsheng discovered the theft of the discounted rice. On the 18th of this month, at 3:40 PM, Head Detective Zhu secretly went to the discounted rice warehouse to observe the situation.

Stealing and Reselling

When a person redeems the discount rice ticket, it must be placed on a metal hook for cancellation. However, these individuals secretly pocketed ten rice tickets, hid them in their clothes, and sold them to others, then returned to the rice warehouse to claim more rice. Head Detective Zhu realized that these individuals were using this method to steal rice tickets, sell them to others for profit, and use the money for their own purposes. He immediately detained the workers Zhu Peizhu, Zhu Peiyao, Cai Mingxiang, and the rice shop deliverymen Hou Xiangquan and Zhu Chenglin, along with ten rice tickets. The legal representative of the Legal Department filed a public prosecution against them for embezzlement under Article 336, Paragraph 1, of the Criminal Law and requested joint detention. An investigation later by Head Detectives Zhao Zhide and Zhu revealed that from January to April 18th, this discounted rice had been sold in fifteen batches. Starting from the fifth batch, there had been this secret fraudulent embezzlement of foreign rice. In total, more than thirty dan (a unit of weight) were missing, worth over 6,000 yuan. Yesterday morning, detectives Zhao and Zhu provided evidence, questioned the defendants, who denied responsibility and gave evasive answers. The case is scheduled for sentencing on May 4th.

### A Rice Purchase Dispute Arises During Street Sales

Yu Shanqing, a local resident living at 34 Baoyu Lane, Dongxin Bridge Street, reported to the French General Patrol Room the other day that he is a rice merchant's runner. Last month, Fei Xianfang from Ningbo (living at 46 Shanquan Lane, Tianj in Road) approached him, claiming to have 100 bags of white rice for sale. Yu Shanqing agreed to purchase 50 bags, with payment upon delivery. However, not long after, Fei's father came to Yu Shanqing, stating that a transportation permit was needed to deliver the rice, which required 1,000 yuan in Japanese military scrip to obtain. Fei then asked Yu Shanqing to meet him at room 312 of the Dazhong Hotel, Zhengjia Wood Bridge, and paid him over 7,200 yuan in old legal tender, equivalent to 1,000 yuan in Japanese military scrip, for which Fei issued a receipt, promising to deliver the rice after obtaining the permit within ten days. However, Fei has since disappeared. Yu Shanqing realized he had been deceived and requested an arrest warrant for interrogation. The head detective approved the report and dispatched detectives to arrest Fei, who confessed that he was involved in another rice purchase dispute and was therefore withholding the funds. He was detained for further investigation.

### Announcement by the Chairman of the British Residents' Association: The Goal of Relieving British Nationals Is to Enable Self-Sufficiency; The British Government Will Only Cover the Deficit in Funds

The Swiss Consulate General in Shanghai and the British Residents' Association have recently begun processing relief loans for British nationals. The fund is entirely funded by the British government, with a portion coming from donations from various parties in Shanghai. British nationals who are genuinely experiencing difficulties in maintaining their livelihoods due to the impact of the war may apply for loans. The maximum loan amount per month is 750 yuan for single individuals, 1,500 yuan for couples, 2,000 yuan for couples with one child, 2,400 yuan for couples with two children, 2,700 yuan for couples with three children, and an additional 300 yuan for each additional child.

Funds Rely on Donations

This fund is managed and distributed by the Swiss Consulate, which is responsible for representing British interests, and the British Residents' Association. Its main source of income is donations from various parties in Shanghai. Although the British government also provides subsidies, the amount is limited to the amount needed to cover any shortfall after donations have been collected. Therefore, Mr. Kohler, the Chairman of the British Residents' Association, has already issued a notice to all British nationals in the city, calling for donations and stating that the goal is to enable local British nationals to be self-sufficient. Therefore, it is necessary to maximize income and reduce expenditure as much as possible. Mr. Kohler hopes that British nationals will be able to reach their goal through self-discipline, collective effort, and mutual support during this difficult time.

Applications Not Permitted Unless Facing Hardship

The conditions for British nationals to apply for loans are extremely strict. The maximum amounts mentioned above will only be granted in special circumstances. Those applying for loans should consider their actual needs and determine the minimum amount required. The loan conditions stipulated by the British Residents' Association are that "loans shall not be requested unless all other sources of funds have been exhausted. If an applicant's income is insufficient to cover expenses, the amount of the loan shall be limited to an amount that does not cause their total income to exceed the prescribed maximum amount and exceed a normal standard of living." Applicants must also provide a guarantee that the loan will be repaid in the future. Holders of foreign currency accounts or other securities must issue checks or provide other collateral.

Four Measures for Donors

Regarding donations, the British Residents' Association has also established four measures: 1. When a donor makes a payment to the fund, the British Residents' Association will record the amount and convert it to pounds sterling at the current exchange rate. 2. If a donor requires assistance from the fund in the future, they must also meet the usual conditions. Assistance will be paid monthly according to the regulations in force at the time, until their original donation is exhausted. These payments may be made without requiring a guarantee that they must be repaid in the future. 3. Repayment to donors will depend on the condition of the fund at the time and whether the British government can continue to provide funds to the Consulate General in the administering country. 4. If the donor does not require assistance, the donated funds will be used entirely for the relief fund.

### U.S. War Prisoners Relief Committee Delivers Second Batch of Goods; Twelve People Granted Permission to Leave Camp the Other Day

This morning (the 27th), the Shanghai American War Prisoners Relief Committee delivered a second large batch of goods, fully loaded on a truck, to Lieutenant Matsuda, Assistant Disbursing Officer of the Japanese Army, for distribution to American prisoners of war in Shanghai.

No Shortage of Clothing and Food

These items, ranging from shirts, shoes, and hats to milk and biscuits, were diverse, totaling 1,139 and a half items. The "half" item was due to there being 29 and a half pairs of socks. Food accounted for the largest number of items, including butter, meat, and canned vegetables, everything was complete. Given the current situation, food is the most important thing, and it will undoubtedly provide great satisfaction to the detained American prisoners. Great attention was also paid to clothing, including no fewer than 149 towels, as well as pajamas and pillowcases, among other things. There were also miscellaneous items such as soap, books, and paper, indicating thorough consideration.

May Be Allowed to Leave Camp in Batches for Recreation

According to a report from the Allied News Agency, twelve American prisoners of war were granted permission by the Japanese Army authorities yesterday afternoon (the 26th) to leave the detention camp and go to Hongkou Park for recreation for two and a half hours. This was the first time they were allowed to leave the detention camp, and they were very happy to have this opportunity. A visit to a Japanese hotel was also very enjoyable. Yesterday's prisoner recreation was of a trial nature. If the results are approved by the Japanese Army authorities, they will be allowed to go out on a regular basis. The twelve American prisoners were led by Major Blanc, former commander of the U.S. Marine Corps stationed in Tianjin, along with four Marine Corps officers, six civilian workers from Wake Island, and one senior crew member from the American merchant ship *Malama*, which was sunk by the Japanese Navy near Tahiti.

### Christian Orphanage Planning Expansion Due to Funding Difficulties; With the Closure of Many Refugee Camps, It Is Difficult to Refuse Orphans Requesting Admission

The Christian Orphanage on Jiangjia Lane, Columbia Road, has been established for more than two years. It houses displaced orphans and refugee children, aiming to educate outstanding children, cultivate healthy citizens, continue the vitality of the nation, and prevent them from becoming a burden on society. Currently, it houses around fifty orphans, but it is facing difficulties in supplying food and has launched a fundraising campaign.

Past History

The orphanage was originally run by Mrs. Main of the American Church, who rented several acres of land on Columbia Road and built multiple houses, including classrooms, dormitories, medical rooms, and a chapel. In the past, Mr. Yu Qiaqing donated ten bags of Saigon rice, the Red Cross donated rice and wheat, and the Chinese Cotton Mill donated sixteen bolts of cloth and four hundred catties of cotton, which were relied upon to sustain the orphanage. This spring, when the American expatriates withdrew from Shanghai, a board of directors was established by local church members such as Li Baiqiang, Huang Lanyu, and Xu Shaodi to continue operations. Originally, it was intended to house thirty orphans, but referrals from various parties came one after another. Impoverished children housed by the Public Works Department's Child Welfare Section were also taken in by the orphanage.

Current Situation

Currently, the orphanage houses a total of thirty children, including thirty-four boys and sixteen girls, aged between six or seven and fourteen years old. Each child requires around twenty-five yuan per month for various expenses, with the rice problem being particularly serious. The orphanage needs approximately four bags of rice, costing 1,300 yuan, which accounts for a large portion of its expenses, making it feel that feeding is difficult. The orphanage is now planning to build additional classrooms and dormitories on the vacant land in order to accommodate more orphans, as many refugee camps are being closed and it is difficult to refuse children requesting admission. If the rice problem can be solved, the number of places can be expanded.

Appeals for Donations

Therefore, it is sincerely hoped that enthusiastic members of the public will donate to help, gathering sand to build a tower and collecting armpits to make a fur coat, so that the power of collective effort can be achieved and the effect of lifting a heavy weight with many hands can be seen. The orphanage realizes that social and economic conditions are difficult and that fundraising is not easy, but while the public's situation is difficult, the situation of orphans is even more difficult. We hope that you will embrace the spirit of "treat the young of others as you would your own" and give generously to the poor. The orphanage has four methods for receiving donations: remittances through the post office, remittances through the bank, delivery by fundraisers, or sending someone to collect the donation. Donors can choose whichever method is most convenient. The orphanage's contact address is: Mr. Li Baiqiang, 422 Hankou Road, Shanghai, or Mr. Xu Shaoshan, 125 Hankou Road.

### Flour Allotment: Approximately Forty Bags Per Day

The Public Works Department's Flour Office has recently continued to designate Taikoo Wharf as the source of flour for various flour product merchants. The flour is transported from the Huasheng Wharf warehouse to Taikoo Wharf to facilitate the extraction by flour product merchants nearby. According to a report by the Datong News Agency, an average of 300 households apply for flour allotment each day, with approximately 4,000 bags allotted. The number of registered flour users is over 4,000, with approval cards issued to about half of them. Recently registered users who have been approved by the office will be notified directly by mail. Those who go to the office to inquire will receive no response.

### Arrest of a Rice Swindler

According to Huaguang News Agency, Fang Bao from Wuxi, aged 30, recently came to Shanghai from his hometown. He recently used the alias Wu Mingde and colluded with Hu Bingjuan to impersonate members of the Shanghai Special City Rice Market Special Investigation Team, selling rice to various households and shops and collecting deposits ranging from one to two hundred yuan. Victims included Mrs. Kong Cao (housewife of Kong Chengji Clothing Store, 66 Kangti Road), Shen Baokang (waiter at the Continental Hotel, 304 Yu Qiaqing Road), Sun A'mei (owner of a hotel at 324 Hubei Road), (owner of a watch shop at 285 Route Min T'i Ni Yin), and Zhao Guangfa (owner of a shoe store at 427 Zhejiang Road). Afterward, they all reported to the French Concession Police.

### One Night of Passion Leads to Tragedy; Bride Commits Suicide, Groom Faints; Strange Incident Under Police Investigation

Wang Dequan, a 27-year-old from Hunan, who lives at 271 Sishun Lane, Da Tong Road, has been working at an antique shop on Wuma Road. Last year, he was introduced by the shop owner and became engaged to a young woman surnamed Zhang (21 years old) from Hangzhou. The wedding was officially held the other day at the Chunhua Lou Restaurant, Daxin Street, Fuzhou Road. In order to simplify things, they rented room 302 of the Xinzha Hotel, Xinzha Road, as their bridal chamber. Unexpectedly, after one night, around 7:00 AM yesterday morning, the bride, Zhang, suddenly jumped out of the room window and committed suicide, falling to the ground with severe injuries to her chest, abdomen, and private parts. Wang, who was in bed, was shocked to see the tragedy and fainted immediately. The hotel clerk reported the incident to the police, and an ambulance was called to rush both of them to Baolong Hospital for treatment. However, Ms. Zhang died from her injuries upon arrival at the hospital, while Wang is still receiving treatment. The police are investigating the cause of the suicide, as the case is very strange.

### Traffic Resumes in Ningbo City; All Restrictions Lifted; Ships Sailing to Ningbo Have Resumed

According to a report by the Datong News Agency, traffic in Ningbo city and the Jiangbei riverbank area has been somewhat restricted since the 21st of this month, causing passengers traveling to Ningbo by ship to be temporarily taxed in various inns along the Bund in Jiangbei or to stay in refugee camps, resulting in a large number of people. These restrictions were lifted on the morning of the 26th of this month. The Haitong ship, scheduled to leave Shanghai for Ningbo on the 26th of this month, was therefore delayed and has now been rescheduled to leave Shanghai for Ningbo this afternoon, carrying approximately 900 passengers. The East Asia Company's Changshan Maru left Shanghai for Ningbo the other day, carrying 400 passengers. The Shanghai-Ningbo Company's Hualin ship left for Ningbo yesterday, and the Wanji ship is scheduled to leave for Ningbo tomorrow.

### A Small Noodle Shop
### Sitting from Noon to Dusk
### Three Fallen Foreign Doctors
### Eating a Delicious Chinese Noodle Meal

One day, in a small noodle shop on the edge of Broadway Road, three foreigners sat around a small round table, each with a bowl of noodles in front of them, steaming hot and fragrant. They ate quietly, but with great effort, because the two smooth chopsticks, in their hands, seemed to be holding a thousand pounds of weight, unable to exert their strength, and extremely clumsy. The other customers were all Chinese, such as dockworkers and rickshaw pullers, who used chopsticks with practiced skill, making it easy to pick up even slippery noodles.

Gradually, customers left the shop one after another, returning to the nearby docks to carry goods, and the monotonous "Hang Yo" sound came in waves. The three foreigners finally managed to stuff the noodles into their stomachs, and by the time they had finished their hearty meal, almost all the customers in the shop had left.

He is a Famous Doctor

"This meal was so delicious!" one of the foreigners said, taking a handkerchief from the unspeakable pocket of his coat and gently wiping his thin lips. This man was no longer young, his temples were silver-gray, and he looked to be about fifty years old. However, his hands were neat and well-proportioned, sticking out from the dirty sleeves, which was very incongruous. It turned out that these were the hands of a famous doctor. Dr. Mitchell Ivanovich Yeblonski, who had specialized in medicine at European and American universities, was indeed somewhat famous. After coming to Shanghai, he also practiced medicine, but he didn't know the trick of boasting, so the clinic was deserted and the situation deteriorated, so he abandoned his profession and looked for another way to make a living.

One of the companions at the table was a German named Kurt Schlesinger, short and fat, bald, with thick-rimmed glasses on his nose. He was also a doctor, but he had to change his profession to make a living. The other was a Polish man named Jan Prilinka, over fifty years old, with a head of golden hair and two green eyes. He had a doctorate in medicine, and his specialty was corpse preservation, but he had also abandoned this profession.

Eaten for Four Weeks

"It's strange," Dr. Prilinka said in German, which all three of them understood, "This kind of Chinese noodles seems to be a very beautiful food. I have eaten it for four weeks, and not only am I not tired of it, but I also have an appetite to eat it for the rest of my life."

Slowly Debate New Issues

Dr. Xu, the German, said with a dismissive look, "Although noodles have the function of filling the stomach, they lack the vitamins, calcium, phosphorus, and other important nutrients necessary for the human body." Dr. Xu spoke eloquently, always with the demeanor of a former lecturer.

"Dear partners," the Russian Dr. Ye interrupted, "Let's slowly debate new issues. The lung and stomach neuropathy problem we discussed yesterday has not been resolved yet. I always insist that we should start with nerve therapy."

Wouldn't it Delay Life

The spirits of Dr. Xu and Dr. Pu were lifted, and they dragged their chairs closer to the round table, listening attentively to Dr. Ye's high-level remarks. After he finished speaking, Dr. Xu shrugged his shoulders and mechanically raised his glasses a little.

"Mr. Yeblonski, I have told you countless times, the patient needs to be given local diagnosis and treatment immediately, but you insist on giving general treatment first. This is a huge mistake, wouldn't it delay the patient's life. Forgive me for being frank, your proposal does not conform to scientific rules, it is simply unacceptable."

"I think you are both wrong," Dr. Pu said impatiently, "In my opinion, we should first think about the patient's health. The body is..."

The other two were somewhat angry. Dr. Ye couldn't help but say in a mocking tone: "Look, partner, our friend is mentioning the body again. A corpse preservation expert will never get rid of his true colors. Why listen to him talking to himself?"

Spent an Afternoon

The whole afternoon was spent in this way. The setting sun in the twilight was moving more and more obliquely, and the street lights were also shining. The three foreign doctors were still sitting around, with some prescriptions and chemical equations on the table, earnestly discussing treatment methods, as if there was a patient lying next to the table, waiting for them to decide their fate.

The dockworkers had finished their day's work and were rushing to dinner. The noodle shop owner had to order them to leave. The three doctors were still enthusiastically discussing, until the owner roared loudly, interrupting the discussion. Dr. Ye stood up, stretched, and said, "God knows, I forgot to peddle shoelaces."

Dr. Xu seemed to understand something, and said, "I also forgot to do business. You know, I sell exquisite clothing."

Dr. Pu laughed, "You are both knowledgeable doctors, but you sell shoelaces and clothing. I can still rely on my old skills to make money. The other day, a Wang A'san died of his old mother, and I went to take care of the body. Afterwards, he gave me five yuan as a reward. It's getting late today, goodbye."

### Sedan-Style Rubber-Wheeled Carriage

This kind of sedan-style carriage, at first glance, looks like an ordinary car, but the water tank and engine at the front of the car have been cut off. How can a car without a motor run on the road? In fact, it's very simple. In the picture, the horse is raising its front hooves and moving forward, isn't it a veritable "motor"? Look at the rubber wheels, with enough air pressure, rolling on the asphalt road with a cement base, pulled by a handsome white horse, moving forward slowly and steadily. It's really comfortable. If the roof of this kind of carriage can be moved at will like a car, then in the warm and sunny morning, remove the roof panel, put down the car window, and drive a few laps on the wide avenue, such as Jing'an Temple Road and Xiafei Road, wouldn't it be very pleasant and "enjoyable"?

### A Merchant Shop on Sijing Road
### Robbed of Huge Sums
### Silver Box Opened and More Than 60,000 Yuan Robbed

Yesterday morning at 8:45, three robbers suddenly came to a merchant shop on Sijing Road in the Public Concession. All of them were holding pistols. After entering, they monitored an apprentice and used a hammer to open the silver box. They were robbed of 8,640 Japanese military notes (approximately more than 60,000 yuan) and 6,000 yuan in legal tender. They took the loot and rushed out of the door and escaped without a trace.

### Li Weining's Regular Concert

A regular concert organized by musician Li Weining at the Baxianqiao YMCA will be held at 5:15 PM on Saturday. The purpose is to promote the most noble music. The hired performers are all first-class musicians in Shanghai. It is said that although Mr. Li knew that the previous program was too heavy, it was still able to win the support of the audience. Although the expenses of this kind of concert are too high, even if it is "full of seats", it is inevitable to lose money. However, Mr. Li still has the spirit of perseverance and resolutely continues. Since the war, the music scene in this city has been very silent. However, after Mr. Li raised his arms and called, the music scene was able to echo back. It is true that "every plant and tree is a soldier" and music can be found everywhere.

It is said that this issue's program is a violin recital by the famous Shanghai musician Adodong. The selection of the entire program has taken great pains. All of them are extremely difficult and famous violin pieces. There is also a sonata by Mozart, which is dominated by the piano and accompanied by the violin. The entire piano will be played or accompanied by Mr. Li himself. It is said that these two music masters have always been close friends. Recently, the two have even doubled their practice together. The result of their cooperation should not be compared with ordinary random combinations without much cultivation.

It is said that after the program list this time, there is a concise explanation compiled by Mr. Li himself, which should be welcomed by the general public. Tickets are now on sale at the Lanxin Grand Theater, Mou Deli Qin Hang, and the YMCA. People who love noble music should not miss this opportunity.

Yesterday's newspaper publication time was 6:20 PM

### Round Gate Ball is Popular for a While
### Organization of League Begins Registration
### Huang Guobin Donates Silver Cup

The round gate ball invented by Mr. Qian Xucang has been very popular since its debut. Because of the tense and enthusiastic competition, it is especially interesting, so it can be popularized.

### Where Did the Small Denomination Notes Go After All?

Small denomination notes have become increasingly scarce today. The most puzzling thing is what is the way out for rice shops that now have a large number of small denomination notes. Why do they only see them coming in and refuse to find them? Moreover, the rice shops are doing everything possible to be opportunistic. For 2.90 yuan per liter of rice, they pay 5 yuan and refuse to find 1 yuan notes. If they pay 3 yuan, they refuse to find 10 cent notes. They are taking advantage everywhere. It can be said that they are worthy of the name, drilling into every seam. Some people say that rice shops collect as many 1 yuan notes as possible and sell them to small money shops. The small money shops then hoard and speculate, with the highest 5 yuan note increasing by 10 yuan, or at least 7-8 yuan. If you buy 2 yuan of cigarettes at a cigarette and paper shop and want to find 2 yuan, it is not good business. They also have a good reason. They can't earn 20 cents from a box of 2 yuan cigarettes. However, if they find 3 yuan small denomination notes, they will lose 30 cents. Many stores have now stated that they will not give change unless you buy 3 yuan (or 2 yuan). When you go to a barber shop, a haircut is 3 yuan. If you pay 5 yuan, they will say thank you and don't expect any change. In addition, there are many statements that if you don't have 1 yuan notes and pay with 5 yuan notes, they will not give change. It is even more difficult to get change on the tram. The ticket sellers keep stuffing the small denomination notes in their pockets. If you want to find 5 yuan, they will not respond as they used to. They will all say that they don't have small denomination notes. The fewer small denomination notes, the more rare they become, and the more they are collected, the less they circulate on the market. In the past, when this kind of situation occurred, there was still relief. But now, a 1 yuan note is only worth a few cents in the past. If you want to print a 1 yuan note, not only is there no way to print it, but the cost is also different from the past. Who would be willing to print it? Who would provide relief? Moreover, 1 yuan notes are the easiest to damage. There is no new supply and many are broken, and broken ones are refused. This is why the number of small denomination notes is decreasing day by day, and there is no way to crack down on hoarding. What can be done about it?

### Gold Shops Sell Off
### Spot Gold Falls Again

Yesterday, the cash spot gold black market fluctuated greatly, and the trend continued to decline, falling below 21,000 yuan, all because of the sell-off by various cash gold shops. The trading was quite active. In the morning, each bar (10 taels) initially traded at 20,800 yuan, which was 100 yuan lower. Then it was 20,850 yuan.

### Public Debt Spot Goods Are Less and Less Traded
### Whether to Draw a Line in the Middle - It's Still Not Certain at This Time

The public debt black market traded poorly yesterday. Originally, there were no spot goods flowing out. However, whether to draw a line in the middle and give up competition is still uncertain at this time. If they can withdraw from the war zone, then the future will still tend to rise, because the powerful factions are said to be waiting for an opportunity to move. Yesterday, the market was quite narrow, and there were no major opponents. Yesterday, Baolong continued to increase its holdings by about 200,000 yuan. It is said that the Dabei gang bought it. The rest received less. Zhihe, Tongshun, Dazhong, Shuntai, Yichang, Jiufu, Tongli, Lianyi, and Shunli, etc., although they were all buying, only bought 570,000 yuan each. The buyers Hongxing was more than 100,000 yuan, and Xie Kang and Tong Kang were about 100,000 yuan each. The rest of Yongkang, Hu Hejiang, Zhenhua, Xinhua, Jiufeng, Hongda, Xinyuan, Xinfeng, Qianyi, etc., although they sold out, only sold 350,000 yuan each. The opening price of Class C was too high, and then it dropped back quickly. After entering, it was pulled up again. Class A was seen at 70 yuan again, and Class B was sold off by Qianyi at the close, so the result was neither glory nor disgrace. The rest rose by 3 to 5 cents each. The transaction was about 670,000 yuan. Here is a brief table: Category Maximum Minimum Closing Compared to the previous day Total A 7.00 69.20 69.90 Up 0.90 Total B 63.00 62.00 61.60 Flat Total C 62.60 61.40 61.10 Up 0.30 Total D 57.20 56.4 17.20 Up 0.60 Total E 59.05 58.60 59.00 Up 0.50

### Cigarette Prices Plunge

The decline in cigarette prices is unstoppable, and the prices of all brands have returned to the original prices in mid-January. The intensity of the change is rarely seen in recent times. At present, because actual sales are difficult to enter a good state, the factory's supply is relatively smooth, speculative activity has decreased, and hoarding households are being forced to prevent mold and flood season, and are eager to sell. In general, they are reluctantly cutting off their losses, so the price is plummeting.

### Diaoding's Source is Obstructed Again

The first batch of more than 150 pieces of Diaoding has arrived. Due to the regulation relationship, the owner's procedures are not in compliance. Therefore, although they have arrived in Shanghai for more than ten days, they have not yet been reported to the warehouse. It is also said that they have been detained. Therefore, the numbers have sent telegrams to temporarily stop the source. However, the national sugar supply in Shanghai has been cut off. Those who are engaged in this business should try to dredge it so as not to interrupt it, so that the supply and demand can be balanced, and they should be needed.

### Xiangchun Buds Fall by 100 Yuan

The opening price of the first batch of Xiangchun buds was too high. Although they are seasonal delicacies, the sales are still relatively sluggish. Therefore, the continued arrival of goods has been reduced by 100 yuan, and it has not yet opened up. The later market is still preventing further loosening.

Spring and Autumn

### Shared Sentiment

— Wei Cheng

It is already difficult enough to mill rice, but to try and earn a tiny profit from “one sheng” milled on the black market is even harder. Some say it is because of these "rice milling gangs" that those who genuinely need to mill rice have no way to "get in," which is indeed the case. However, who isn't truly in need of milling rice? The "rice milling gangs" endure physical pain, going back and forth repeatedly, their stomachs perhaps already so empty they're about to vomit clear water.

Reserve notes of five yuan are not accepted as change. Legal tender, however, must be in single-yuan notes. Even two people from "affiliated businesses" together don't want five-yuan notes. I wonder, when rice shops get rice from the warehouses, do they bring thousands of single-yuan notes? But now is not the time to reason; the moment you reason, you are already out of the long queue. Milling one sheng of rice, how could it be easy?

In the past, there were stories of "accidental gunfire." Now, there have been tragedies of "collapsing and dying of exhaustion." All for the sake of eating. Alas, how tragic!

"Hong Kong to Resume Horse Racing," seen in telegrams, has sparked much discussion. The matters before our eyes, however, are all too commonplace. If we were to switch places, I think we would all share the same sentiment!

### Speculation

— Er Dong

Notes from the Thatched Cottage of Close Observations quotes Li Yunju, saying: "There was a man who was the richest in the village, hoarding over a thousand dan of grain. When famine struck, he refused to open his stores. Suddenly one day, he quietly gathered his servants, arranged measuring tools, and wrote a red notice, posting it on his door, saying: 'In this year of famine and hunger, how can I bear to be the only one full? I now plan to lend all my accumulated grain to my neighbors; each person will receive one dan as the standard. Come immediately with your sacks to collect it, or the grain will be gone.' Nearby residents, hearing this, gathered like clouds. In less than a day, the grain was gone. Some who wished to see the master to thank him found that the master was nowhere to be found. In great haste, they searched and found him fast asleep in his old, dilapidated house. When people arrived, he yawned and stretched. Beside him, they found a piece of paper saying: 'Hoarding without distributing is a wellspring of resentment; where resentment gathers, disaster follows. With thousands starving and one family full, robbery becomes inevitable. Is it better to perish without a good name? Feeling gratitude for your past virtues, I am acting virtuously on your behalf. I hope you will forgive my presumptuousness; this is what I deeply fear! He recalled nothing of what he had said or done. Inquiring about the beginning and end, he merely sighed. But the people were indeed restless, with plans to burn and loot; this charitable act turned disaster into fortune. Was this a shapeshifting demon (a fox)? It can be said that it loved people with virtue…"

After reading this, I was reminded of Feng Xuan, who once purchased righteousness for Lord Mengchang.

Feng Xuan's "purchasing righteousness" can be seen in historical records; the fox spirit's "acting virtuously" can only be seen as a fable. However, finding such a lovable person as Feng Xuan today would be like wearing out iron shoes without success. Perhaps there was a kind of "ancient virtue that could be followed" in ancient times, but today, people's hearts are not as ancient. Whether this is true or not, I dare not say for sure.

Some say that religions like heaven are created by people who, suffering in reality, dream of seeking spiritual comfort and a place to entrust their souls. If this is to be believed, then theology may become particularly prevalent in the near future.

This is, of course, a speculation, but there are reasons to support it.

In a year of famine and hunger, those who are full not only "hoard without distributing" but also hoard and speculate excessively. Since those who purchase righteousness have disappeared, people have no choice but to retreat and hope that there can truly be a "shapeshifting demon" in the world that "acts virtuously on behalf of others."

Although I dare not predict, the above speculation is very likely to become a reality.

### Waiting

— Xing Yun

It is said that Zhang Liang used to meet with the Old Man of Yellow Rock. The first time, Zhang Liang went at dawn, but the old man was already there. The second time, he went at the crowing of the rooster, but the old man was still there first. The third time, he went before midnight, and only then did he arrive before the old man.

Now, to "mill rice," going at dawn will certainly leave you empty-handed; going at the crowing of the rooster might not get you anything either. So, you have to go to wait next to the rice shop in the middle of the night.

However, what Zhang Liang waited for was the "Grand Duke's Art of War" to "pacify the world," while what we wait for is merely one sheng of rice, which is not even enough to stave off hunger.

### Where are the Three "Fundamentals"?

— Fang Sheng'er

In the past, an industrialist had a famous saying: "A businessman must have three fundamentals: first, fundamental conscience; second, fundamental capital; third, fundamental ability." This was then called the "Three Fundamentals Doctrine."

Fundamental conscience is a good conscience, "commercial ethics." Fundamental capital is capital, "commercial capital." Fundamental ability is capability, "commercial knowledge" plus experience, a rather abstract but indispensable force for engaging in commerce.

But look at today's "businessmen." They are well-versed in the way of hoarding. They used to hoard rice, now they hoard medicine. Where is the fundamental conscience? As for selling short and buying long, where is the fundamental capital? As for ability, they neither "manage" anything nor need to "plan" anything; they simply "tumble" on the telephone dial and "solicit" and "sell" while pacing back and forth. Where is the ability? Yet, this is also doing business. Alas!

### Wise Words

— Nan Ding

Since people know to cherish life, do not waste time. Time is the raw material for creating life.

(Benjamin Franklin)

Without freedom, the nation cannot exist; without virtue, freedom cannot exist.

(Jean-Jacques Rousseau)

Do not neglect small things, and then you can accomplish great things.

(Napoleon I)

I never dared to relax my doubts, but studied them repeatedly until I understood them. (John Stuart Mill)

### Record of Unemployment

— Gong Ji

Unemployed.

The first satisfying thing about being unemployed is the freedom to sleep as one pleases. In the past, because I had to rush to the office at a set time every day, I was always somewhat sleepy. Drowsing in the office was, of course, not allowed, but yawning incessantly seemed to be in poor taste. Now, all is well. I don't need an alarm clock or someone to wake me up. I can stay under the warm covers as long as I please, sleeping until the sun is high in the sky.

Opening my eyes, the first thing I see is my three-year-old son, Xiaobaxi, between my wife and me, staring blankly at the ceiling with wide eyes.

"Call me Papa."

"No!" Xiaobaxi has a stubborn spirit.

"If you don't call me Papa, I won't buy you candy."

"Papa."

I laughed. My wife was also awakened by the laughter. But thinking of the father-son relationship as nothing more than an economic issue, I felt somewhat melancholic.

After finishing the three-part routine of getting up, gargling, washing my face, and eating a snack, I first pick up the day's newspaper to browse through it. Although unemployed, I still subscribe to the newspaper. It is said that the newspaper is the food of culture. If I am not dead for a day, then it is necessary to continue enjoying this cultural food for a day. I read the political news first. Not because I am deliberately pretending to care about national affairs, but because national affairs do need to be cared about. Next, I read the economic news because, although unemployed, I still have some commercial dealings. Besides, I occasionally go to so-called markets. After reading the news, I read the advertisements. I have always paid attention to small advertisements, especially the "seeking marriage" or "seeking friends" ads in the recruitment section. Not because I want to apply, but because there is often "remarkable writing" to appreciate. Now, I am dizzy from the "seeking" and "selling."

### Sharing the Boat in the Storm

— He Jia Zhi

(4) In the Lingering Light

Guofang tried hard to accommodate what Weicheng said about not having picked up any bad habits, lowering the tone of her words. Smiling, she said, "I only have an older brother, not an older sister, so let's just consider Sister Cuizhen as my older sister." Cuizhen said, "Brother Cheng, look at Miss Chen, she's praising me to this extent. What should I say?" Weicheng said, "Guofang is also a straightforward person. She rarely flatters people casually. It's just that I've suffered a great loss; otherwise, during the New Year, when Guoqi and Guofang came together, how happy we would have been! Now, my mind is so confused that I don't know what I'm saying. Having Guofang here makes me feel a little better." Hearing his voice falter, Cuizhen stood up again and said, "You sit. I'm used to working; I can't just sit here properly. I hear a voice that sounds like Great Aunt is here." Weicheng said, "Oh, they've come to discuss the funeral arrangements." Cuizhen left, and he also went out to see Great Aunt. Not only Great Aunt came, but Li Xieshe also came. They were discussing how to handle the funeral. Guofang began to feel uneasy.

They were close relatives of the Ye family, discussing necessary matters. After finishing the discussion, they all left. Weicheng came to tell Guofang, "The date for my mother's funeral has been set for the second day of the second lunar month. Now, we need to rush to print the obituary. Let me find the obituary from when my father passed away and the obituaries sent by relatives and friends to use as references. There should also be a memorial preface at the end. Can you help me with it?" Guofang quickly shook her head, saying, "I can't do this. This is formal writing. Although we have formal writing class every two weeks at school, where the teacher writes on the blackboard and tells us to copy it down, who wants to copy it? Especially the bereavement notice, obituary, memorial preface, and the wording for sending condolences. None of the students wanted to copy them. One student, who is from Suzhou, said fiercely that whoever copied them was preparing to use them when their own parents died. So, no one paid attention. Asking me is like asking a blind person. I only know that when both parents die, you call yourself an orphan and bereaved child; when the father dies, you call yourself an orphan son; when the mother dies, you call yourself a bereaved son. But things like 'weeping blood' or 'kowtowing' are not clear to me. If you want to ask me, wedding etiquette is something I have some idea about because I have been a bridesmaid twice, and once I was chosen as the female guest representative to deliver a congratulatory speech. At weddings, if you bow incorrectly, everyone just laughs. Getting it wrong here would be a disaster." (61)

### Reasons for the Lack of Small Denomination Notes

— Pan Shan

Recently, there has been a shortage of small denomination notes on the market again. Asking friends at the bank, they all replied, "We don't even have enough for our own use." Asking at the small money shops on Sichuan Road, the premium has risen to as high as ten yuan for every hundred. The currency of the same bank is being discounted by ten percent. It is truly unbelievable.

Stepping into a small noodle shop to order a bowl of plain noodles, the waiter will ask you if you have small denomination notes. If you answer no, he will impolitely ask you to leave. The reason is—I don't take five-yuan notes.

So, where have all the small denomination notes gone?

There is no doubt that some people are hoarding them, but small denomination notes are not silver or nickel coins, with their own intrinsic value that can be melted down for other uses. The fact that they are being hoarded for profit must have other reasons.

Having finished reading the newspaper, it is time for lunch. Since becoming unemployed, I have long practiced a one-dish-one-soup principle. Occasionally, I buy half a catty of meat to eat. However, the vegetable vendor often recognizes my wife as a new face, and the weight is especially skimped. Whether braised in soy sauce or boiled plain, it looks pitiful in the bowl. But my appetite does not decrease because there is less food and rice is expensive. It takes three bowls to satisfy me. It is said that "in a year of famine, the belly grows large." Judging from this, there is evidence.

The time after lunch is the hardest to endure. Going to the cinema or theatre occasionally is permissible. But if I were to go every day, turning into a professional theatre-goer, it would violate the economic principles of unemployment. Staying at home, I don't play mahjong without one short player, and the novels and magazines are either already read or too cliché. After much consideration, I have no choice but to get up and wander the streets. The road is as smooth as a whetstone, as straight as an arrow. There is no need to pay road tolls, and I can also look at fashionable girls. Why not? Appreciating the Misses' eyebrows, shaved clean and drawn with charcoal pencils, some are like the crescent moon of the third night, others are drawn as a straight line. I often wonder if the Misses are trying to prove on their faces the geometric principle that the shortest distance between two points is a straight line. Their cheeks are painted red. Those who have applied it evenly are fine, but some have two distinctly red cheekbones, giving the impression of prominent peaks. Besides people, there are also many things to see. Look at the cakes in the window; even after having eaten a full meal, I want to have one. Looking at the furniture in the furniture store, I can't bear to leave after one glance. Standing in front of the music store, listening to the records being played, I can pretend to have musical talent. When my legs are tired from walking, I can stand in the lobby of the cinema. Fortunately, my clothes are not too tattered. The cinema boy thinks that I have bought a ticket and am waiting for a friend to arrive. Moreover, the movie photos on the walls can dispel my loneliness. When I am satisfied, I return home and lean back on the worn-out sofa, waiting for dinner.

After eating dinner, I go to bed early. Tomorrow morning, I will while away this unemployed time again.

We might as well stand in the position of the hoarders to explore the reasons. The conclusion may be their motive. Due to the impact of the war, the reserves of daily necessities in Shanghai are decreasing day by day. For the welfare of the citizens, the Municipal Council began to set price limits and purchase limits for rice, oil, flour, corn flour, etc. As a result, the need for small denomination notes increased sharply, because the long lines of people waiting in front of the rice shops had to hold small denomination notes in their hands. Thus, clever people began to use their brains, feeling that there was profit to be made. They secretly started buying them up. Small money shops responded to the news, unwilling to be left behind. As a result, the small denomination notes received by various retail stores were unwilling to come out. Even various snack stalls posted notes saying, "Change will only be given for amounts above two yuan." In addition, tram ticket sellers took advantage of the situation. As a result, small denomination notes became a commodity, with a market value like US dollars and military notes.

"He who first made burial figures had no posterity." But this curse is useless. The only way is to increase the issuance of small denomination notes, so that hoarders have no way to use their skills.

It must be known—unclogging the source is the fatal weakness of all hoarders.

### A Small Analogy

— Lin Daiqiu

Conscience is a mirror, sin is dust, and self-renewal is the cloth for wiping the mirror.

The human body is as precious as life, the shadow is like truth, and sunlight is like struggle.

Will is like a jockey, determination is like a rein, strength is like a horse, and behavior is like running.

Hesitation is like fog, determination and action are like sunlight.

Love is like a tree, passion is the branches and leaves, and understanding is the roots.
