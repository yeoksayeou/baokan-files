### Japanese Occupy Entire Timor Island, Intensifying Encirclement of Australia

 Allied News Agency, Eighteenth, from a certain Japanese base: According to front-line reports, Japanese forces completely occupied Portuguese Timor Island on the 12th of this month.  The remaining Allied forces have been completely cleared out.

 Reuters, London, Eighteenth: Japanese naval forces are currently moving towards Timor Island and New Guinea. Military observers in London believe that the purpose of the Japanese troop movement is to completely occupy Timor and New Guinea, in order to block the sea from Timor to Darwin and isolate New Guinea from the Torres Strait off the coast of Queensland, Australia. This is the most necessary step for attacking Australia.

 Reuters, Wellington, Nineteenth: Before the secret meeting of the New Zealand Parliament, Prime Minister Fraser delivered a speech, emphatically stating that the danger of a Japanese invasion of Fiji has intensified. It is said that the Allies cannot afford the slightest mistake at this stage. Maintaining New Zealand and Australia as bases for offensive and defensive operations, and as important communication points for traffic to the United States, is a crucial point of the Allies' general strategy. The Allies must make enormous efforts to take the initiative and launch offensives. The British and American governments have promised to provide large-scale assistance to New Zealand, and various forms of aid are already on their way.

 Active Air Forces on Both Sides

 Reuters, Canberra, Nineteenth: Australian Prime Minister Curtin announced in a communique today that the Australian Air Force re-attacked Rabaul on Wednesday during the day and conducted reconnaissance flights over New Britain and other areas. Japanese aircraft also conducted reconnaissance flights over Papua and New Guinea. On Wednesday afternoon, Japanese aircraft reconnoitered an island near Cape York (Queensland). The Japanese aircraft were divided into two teams, reconnoitering for fifteen minutes without attacking. The alert was lifted one hour later.

### Macarthur's Authority Clarified: Responsible for Implementing Supreme Strategy

 Reuters, Canberra, Nineteenth: It is reported that General MacArthur, as the Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces in Australia, is responsible for implementing the supreme strategy. The Australian army is still commanded by Australians, but is under MacArthur's command and maintains close contact with the Allied forces. Lieutenant General Brett will command the Allied air forces. The Australian Air Force is still commanded by Australian officers, but is under Brett's command.

 Cable from Chongqing, Nineteenth: General MacArthur has been appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Allied Forces in Australia and New Zealand.

I am confident that with Your Excellency's skilled strategy, you will complete a chapter in the great cause of humanity. I hereby send my congratulations."

 Huitong News Agency, Stockholm, Nineteenth: According to news from London received here, opinions in London are divided on the appointment of General MacArthur, Commander of the American Forces in the Philippines, as Commander-in-Chief of the Allied Forces in the Southwest Pacific. From a military standpoint, this matter is welcomed by all parties, as the United States has now decided to take action. Military correspondents in London newspapers hope that MacArthur can repel the Japanese offensive against Australia. "Daily Mail," "Daily Express," "News Chronicle," and "Daily Telegraph" are vigorously promoting MacArthur to the British people as a capable military strategist, and believe that MacArthur's new appointment is sufficient to show that the United States and Britain will launch an offensive in the near future. This is the only significance of the appointment of an American general as Commander-in-Chief of the Allied Forces in the Southwest Pacific. MacArthur's new appointment is in response to Australia's special request, and proves that the connection between Australia and the British Empire is becoming increasingly loose. After MacArthur takes office as commander-in-chief, his work will be far from easy. The work in the Southwest Pacific is ten thousand times more difficult than in the Philippines, because the army in the Philippines was organized by MacArthur himself, while the Australian military, after repeated defeats, must be reorganized.

He also instructed shipowners sailing along the Atlantic coast to take strict protective measures. Knox also stated that most ship losses occurred at night, so ships should try to avoid entering coastal ports at night. However, ships traveling south that cannot avoid entering ports must extinguish all lights. Shipowners who do not comply with this rule will have their licenses revoked. Knox also proposed a precautionary measure, namely, implementing light controls in coastal ports, so that the outlines of ships do not appear against a bright background, making them visible to the enemy. He concluded, "We do not want to lose another ship."

### Turkish President's Speech Expresses Strict Neutrality

 Havas, Istanbul, Eighteenth: Turkish President İsmet İnönü delivered an important speech today in Smyrna, strongly stating that Turkey wishes to adhere strictly to neutrality and is determined to defend the motherland against any attack. He said, "To this day, no country is unaffected by the war. The number of belligerent countries is increasing daily, accounting for the majority of the world's countries. Only a small number of countries remain outside the conflict, Turkey being one of them. But we are still always concerned about suffering the consequences of war. The current international situation clearly needs to be studied from this perspective. Our country's foreign policy has long been declared to the outside world. Because we have treaty relations with both sides of the belligerents, we faithfully fulfill any treaty we have signed, without distinction. However, it is extremely difficult to adopt an impartial and friendly policy towards all countries during wartime. The government, with the trust of the National Assembly, is now promoting this policy with a serious and fair attitude. At present, we have almost no problems that would drag us into the vortex of war. Looking at the sky, it is clear and blue, without clouds. But we must still take all measures, closely monitor the future development of the current war, and never be negligent. We are prepared to defend the motherland. Since the outbreak of the Great War, the whole country has entered a state of mobilization. The country has never been as well prepared as it is today. In today's world, Turkey is truly the most fortunate country, so the government's adoption of some restrictive measures has been accepted by the Turkish people. We are now doing everything we can to keep our country out of the conflict. If other countries forcibly impose war on us, then for the sake of honor and dignity, we have no choice but to rise up and defend ourselves. The current war may be prolonged, but in any case, Turkey will become a great power after the war."

### British Admiralty Announces Expansion of Prohibited Navigation Zones; French West Coast Included; Three American Ships Sunk in the Atlantic

 Havas, London, Eighteenth: The Admiralty recently issued a communique announcing the expansion of prohibited navigation zones in the Atlantic. The scope is wider than that announced on November 1, 1940. Ships entering the prohibited area are responsible for their own risks.

 Huitong News Agency, Madrid, Nineteenth: The Falangist Party organ newspaper "Arriba" criticized Britain's blockade policy yesterday, stating that Spain, as a non-belligerent country, is suffering such pain, which is illegal. The gasoline problem is particularly important to Spain. In 1929, Spain imported 352,000,000 litres of gasoline. Since that year, the gasoline consumption of various countries has increased threefold. It is heard that after Spain's railways were destroyed in the civil war, Spain's transportation is even more dependent on automobiles. But in 1941, Spain only had 263,000,000 litres of gasoline. The situation with kerosene in Spain is also equally serious. However, while there is no need for gasoline in other areas of Europe, gasoline is being transported in. Now, large teams of automobiles, fishing boats, and factories in Spain have stopped operating, the only reason being Britain's ban on gasoline imports.

### Leningrad Front: Fierce Fighting Continues

### Field Marshal List Inspects German Troops in Finland, Related to Spring Offensive

Stockholm, Sweden, 18th (Havas) - After inspecting German troops stationed in northern Norway, Field Marshal List passed through Sweden a few days ago and arrived in Finland to inspect the German troops stationed there before returning to Norway. While List's two inspections appeared unremarkable, those in responsible positions here believe that this move is related to the German army's preparations for a spring offensive in Finland. As for rumors that new German troops have been deployed to Finland, this cannot be confirmed here yet. Currently, various transportation difficulties are due to sea ice and impassable waterways. However, German troops occupying the line from northern Petsamo to Salla may still receive reinforcements, and it is believed that the battlefield there will expand further south. According to well-informed military sources, the German army may attack the Murmansk railway from the north, thereby pressing on Kandalaksha and Sortavala to threaten the junction of the Murmansk-Arkhangelsk railway, which has always been in Red Army hands and has never been directly attacked by Finnish forces. Furthermore, according to news from foreign correspondents in Berlin, there are confirmed to be several armories along the Baltic coast.

### Lyon Supreme Court Continues Trial of National Betrayal Case, General Gamelin and Others Appear to Defend. France's Defeat Attributed to Air Force Inferiority

Lyon, France, 18th (Havas) - The Lyon Supreme Court convened its 15th session today to try those involved in the national betrayal case. Former Commander of the Alpine Front, General Mittelhauser, spoke, stating that at the beginning of the war, the Alpine fortifications were largely complete and the morale of the defenders was very high. Every enemy offensive was met with a head-on blow, and resistance only ceased when German forces copied our rear and the armistice agreement was signed. We used six divisions to contend with twenty Italian divisions. German forces launched several divisional attacks against us each time, but they were all repelled. However, our forces lacked sufficient officers and both direct-fire and anti-aircraft guns. There was also a lack of communication between the army and the air force, resulting in heavy losses for our forces. As far as tanks are concerned, the German and Italian armies had already gained experience in the application of this weapon during the Spanish Civil War, while we were extremely backward in tank tactics, and even as late as 1937 we were unable to use tank tactics. As for the role of the air force in offensive warfare, we were also completely ignorant. I myself only recognized the power of the air force after the Norwegian campaign. At that time, I warned Commander-in-Chief of the National Defense Army, General Gamelin, that dive bombers were a major crisis, as the effectiveness of German bombing technology was astonishing and greatly contributed to undermining morale. In addition, France did not have sufficient intelligence on the military developments in Spain during the Spanish Civil War. On December 15, 1939, I notified the General Staff that the anti-aircraft gun teams under my command were extremely ineffective. If my unit were to be attacked by dive bombers at this time, the whole of France would have to allow the invaders to drive straight in. In terms of the various delaying tactics adopted by France before the defensive war period, they were also ill-conceived. At this point, Daladier asked the witness if he knew that in 1939 the French army had a total of 37,000 officers, which was an increase of 7,400 over the legal quota. General Gamelin suddenly spoke, stating that there were more French officers in 1939 than in the previous Great War in 1914. Not only that, I dare say that at the beginning of the war, France had 4,000 more officers than Germany. Daladier then asked General Mittelhauser to confirm the figures he had put forward, namely, "In July 1938, France had only 34 modern tanks, which increased to 3,500 in 1939, and the number of anti-aircraft guns also increased to 2,500," and emphasized that he had worked hard to rearm during his tenure as Minister of National Defense. General Mittelhauser immediately replied that our rearmament plan, whether in concept or execution, was too late. Next, former Commander-in-Chief of the Ume District, General Franois, the current Commander of the Algiers Region in North Africa, was called as a witness. He stated that the most important factor in frontline warfare was the limited scope of French air force activity, which was insufficient to protect the army from air attacks. The troops transferred from North Africa to the frontline can be called "professional troops." They fought bravely, and not only were the officers excellent, but even the reservists were first-class soldiers. As for the equipment, it was also very good, but there was a lack of hand grenades and motorcycles. Our mechanized units, in terms of materials alone, can be said to be excellent. Our position was also better than in 1914, and morale was high. All the soldiers under my command were able to do their duty, and I loved them all very much. The people of the country were also encouraged by their brave fighting, but because of the lack of air force and heavy artillery, our offensive was only assisted by a small number of tanks, which was very difficult to take effect. Even the bunkers were insufficient. Finally, General Le Gentilhomme, former commander of the Twentieth Army Group, was called as a witness. His words were slightly toned down, attributing France's setbacks entirely to the inadequacy of the French air force. When I asked to strengthen the Vosges Mountains defense line, I encountered great difficulties. In the Saar area, we still had great confidence in the natural barriers as our lines. From the Commander-in-Chief to the ordinary soldiers, they were all able to fulfill their responsibilities. However, because the number of reservists was limited, and their military training only knew theory, their combat capability was very weak. Most of them had only received one year of training, and since 1936, the spirit of the army had deteriorated. Among the officers at all levels, there were also Communist elements, although few in number, they were very active, but it is also a fact that all necessary sanctions were taken at the time. In short, at the outbreak of the war in 1939, the morale of our army was exactly the same as what we had seen three years ago." The court then adjourned at 5:45 p.m. and scheduled to reconvene at 1:30 p.m. tomorrow to call witnesses.

Stockholm, Sweden, 19th (Haitong Agency) - According to news from British capital reported by Swedish newspaper, British Prime Minister Churchill met with Soviet Ambassador Maisky last weekend to discuss Anglo-Soviet relations. As for the relationship between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, it is unlikely to be clarified before the US Ambassador Winant returns to his post. According to a correspondent for the Swedish "Dagens Nyheter," both sides were extremely satisfied with Churchill's meeting with the Soviet ambassador, but no decisions were made during the meeting. The content of the talks was largely about political cooperation after the war. This meeting proves that Britain is more willing to cooperate with the Soviet Union than it was several weeks ago.

### Chinese Female Painter Presents Painting to US President

New York, 18th (Special Dispatch) - According to the New York Times, Ms. Zhang Guangsong, the goddaughter of the famous Chinese artist Guo Guifeng (transliteration), recently painted an American eagle (the national bird of the United States) and presented it to President Roosevelt. When the Japanese army besieged Nanjing, Ms. Zhang worked as a nurse in a rear hospital for two years. Later, she went to the United States to study painting. Her works have been exhibited at the World's Fair in San Francisco. Last year, Ms. Zhang came to New York. The late President Roosevelt's mother greatly admired Ms. Zhang's works and asked her to paint several paintings for her, one of which was the painting of the United States presented to the President. Last week, the United China Relief Association publicly exhibited the painting, which will be delivered to the White House within days.

### The Kachin People of Burma

In peacetime, if murders, intentional homicides, or accidental deaths occur among the Kachin people, although there is no judicial system to impose sanctions, the village organization is also extremely strict. Usually, the elderly village chief comes out to handle the matter, and according to the severity of the crime, a fine is set, which the murderer admits and pays. If the murderer does not have the means or is unwilling to pay, the matter can only be resolved by force. Both sides gather their comrades and engage in large-scale armed clashes, and they will not stop until the great hatred has been avenged and they are satisfied. Even if the person concerned dies without avenging the wrong, his descendants will continue to retaliate for generations. If their goods, such as grains and livestock, are stolen, or if their wives and daughters are enticed into adultery or give birth to illegitimate children, the same custom of paying fines is adopted to end the crime. Otherwise, they can only rely on force to deal with each other. During armed clashes, they rely entirely on their physical strength to win, and never use skill to subdue. As the saying goes, honest people do not do secret things, and everyone maintains a gentlemanly attitude.

On the day of the armed clash, the angry mobs stirred up the entire village. If a person from Village A is killed in Village B, then all the men, women, old and young in Village B are enemies of Village A, regardless of whether you are related to the matter or not. If you meet on a narrow road, you must be constantly on guard for the danger of death. In the past, when a British expedition passed through Bhamo and the Chinese border, they punished several Kachin people, which they considered a great humiliation, forever imprinted in the hearts of everyone. Twenty years later, when another team of British missionaries passed through this place, they were seriously attacked. When they go out, they must carry a long knife on their shoulder. In the past, they also carried long spears and used strong bows and poisoned arrows, but now they are very particular and have a good gun. They also have flintlock guns, which can play a great role in the depths of the O Mountains.

The Kachin people are very hospitable. Any travelers passing through their mountain country will receive courteous hospitality and enjoy several days of warm treatment. In the surrounding villages, they can get food supplies without spending a penny, and even if you are willing to give them some reward, they will firmly refuse. When you finish your travels, they can also protect you with weapons and escort you out of the country, with heartfelt farewells and a promise to meet again in the future.

Regarding cultivation, the Kachin people still use primitive methods. Every year in early spring, they choose a large piece of land in the dense forest and cut down all the trees, so that the land can be exposed to sunlight. After some time, they set fire to burn the roots of the trees, turning it into a scorched earth. They use hoes to level the ground and then sow seeds. The Kachin people have always regarded slash-and-burn cultivation as beautiful and good. They continue to cultivate in the same place the following year, but by the third year, they believe that the land is no longer fertile and must choose another place to cut down trees.

Like other uncivilized peoples, the Kachin people live in a polytheistic social stage. They believe that trees have tree spirits, mountains have mountain spirits, and even insects, fish, flowers, and plants all have spirits. Spirits have the power to control the thirty-three heavens, the eighteen layers of hell, and the stars, sun, and moon. Spirits can bring blessings and disasters. Whether the crops are abundant and the livestock thrive are all the work of spirits. They believe that spirits are narrow-minded, and if they are not sincerely offered sacrifices, they will never bestow blessings. Conversely, if they are offered sacrifices of cattle and sheep at all times, they will surely pray for blessings and gain blessings, and seek longevity and gain longevity. The people who communicate with spirits are shamans, who have a special status in society and are respected by the masses.

Although the Kachin people live a primitive life and are superstitious about divine power, they are all very strong, not afraid of hardship, able to adapt to the environment, and able to fight against nature. Relying on these points, they have lived in the deep mountains for generations. Regarding their population, it is of course impossible to estimate because they are scattered everywhere, but according to the vast area they currently inhabit, the strength of this nation is quite great. It is said that forty years ago, Dr. O.H. Hanson, a Baptist missionary from the United States, used Roman letters to spell out the Kachin language and created a Kachin script. In this vast mountainous area, some young people are gradually using this new script.

The most powerful and influential ethnic group bordering the Kachin people is the Lisu people. These two major ethnic groups belong to the same Mongoloid race in bloodline, and migrated slowly southward from their old home in Tibet. There are also Lisu tribes in the Nujiang Mountains of Yunnan. This is like the Shan people of Myanmar, distributed in China, Myanmar, and Thailand. These several powerful ethnic groups live primitive lives, stretching for thousands of years and always possessing a fighting character, which must not be underestimated.

### Rice Supply Already Arranged, Residents Need Not Worry, Needed Rice Amount Guaranteed by Japanese Authorities

A public announcement by the Shanghai Municipal Council Information Office states: The Council has always paid special attention to the food needs of the two settlements, especially rice, in the past three months, and has maintained close contact with the Japanese and French Concession authorities. At the same time, the authorities have had the closest cooperation in obtaining the required food supplies, and have carefully planned to ensure that all citizens can obtain their allocated amount of food.

Inventory as Usual, Sources Assured

Residents need not worry about the future rice supply. Until recently, domestic rice has been continuously entering the settlement, but although the entry of domestic rice has stopped, the Japanese authorities have guaranteed to the Council that they will allow the Council to handle the rice supply. This rice is equivalent to the amount of domestic rice that has been trickling into Shanghai in the past, so the city's rice inventory has not been affected. In addition, the Japanese authorities will allocate rice to the Council for the needs of large food consumers and for sale to the public through rice shops. In the future, the Council will continue to supply this rice to all food consumers.

French Concession Also Supplied

In the past three months, the French authorities have been in constant contact with the Japanese and Public Concession authorities regarding the food supply for residents, and have paid attention to it, especially the rice issue. This close cooperation has never been interrupted, in order to ensure that residents do not have to worry about the lack of essential food. In short, the public does not need to worry about the future rice supply. Although the domestic rice that used to arrive in Shanghai has now stopped, the rice inventory can still be maintained, and the Japanese authorities have guaranteed to the French Council that they are willing to supply the Council with the same amount of domestic rice as before. As for the rice needed by large food consumers and retail rice shops, the French authorities can obtain it from the Japanese authorities for distribution.

Rice Shops Today All Sell Corn

The Rice and Grain Office of the Shanghai Municipal Council designated the foreign rice extracted from the Yuan Tonghua Sheng Zhejiang and other three warehouses the other day, and rice shops can sell it out today to meet the needs of tomorrow (Saturday). Today (Friday), all 395 rice shops in the two concessions are selling corn. The rice shops have extracted all of this corn yesterday. The Flour Office of the Shanghai Municipal Council hopes to have whole bags of corn flour for sale soon to meet the needs. The quality is roughly number three or four. The application method is roughly the same as for flour. The weight, price, and transportation cost of the whole bag of corn flour will be negotiated and announced soon.

Bread Purchase Divided Between New and Old Customers

The Shanghai Times reported that in order to establish an effective bread distribution method for residents within the French Concession, so as to eliminate the crowding in front of bakeries, the French Concession authorities announced the implementation of a new system yesterday (the 18th), stipulating that each bakery should distribute bread to registered old customers in the morning, and then sell it to residents who did not get bread in the morning in the afternoon. Until now, old customers of bakeries still had to line up in the same line with occasional purchasers. But under the current system, they will register with the French authorities so that they can get allocated bread in the morning. The implementation of this new distribution system can prevent crowding in front of bakeries and help the authorities estimate the total amount of flour needed by bakeries to supply old customers.

Rice and Bread Cannot Be Obtained at the Same Time

The authorities are now also formulating plans to prevent bread and rice from being allocated to the same household at the same time. If these plans are realized, then most of the Chinese who usually eat rice will not be able to buy bread from bakeries. When bakeries register the number of customers with the authorities, they must report the customer's name, address, the amount of bread consumed daily, and the number of people in their household, so that registered customers can buy bread without worrying about a shortage. As for unregistered customers who occasionally come to buy bread, they can buy bread in the afternoon. However, the distribution system for unregistered customers has been studied, because the authorities know that there are often those who buy more bread from several stores than they need. A person from a large bakery in the French Concession told reporters yesterday that the list of old customers in the store has now been completed, so registration can be done soon. The Shanghai Public Concession Municipal Council is paying close attention to these developments and has studied the implementation of the same method.

Council Will Issue a Notice Soon

The English-language Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury reported that the Shanghai Municipal Council announced this morning (the 19th) its intention to formulate regulations for the supply of bread to residents within the Concession. Queuing to buy bread is a common sight in the Public Concession, so the Council has decided to control the sale of bread by bakeries. Although no definite decision has been made, it is expected that the Council will issue a notice soon.

### Soviet Ship to Sail to Vladivostok, General Valery to Continue Sailing between Shanghai and Vietnam

The Shanghai Times reports that the Soviet ship Bichevaya Industriya, leased by the Expoithleb Association, has been repaired in Shanghai and is scheduled to set sail for Vladivostok in a few days. This ship and four other Soviet ships, namely the Gorky, Timiryazev, Volkov, and Komintern, came here from Vladivostok last year for major repairs. Three of them left Shanghai before the outbreak of the war, and the Timiryazev sailed out a month ago, leaving only the Bichevaya Industriya. Originally a ship used for fish canning, it has now been converted into a cargo and passenger ship, carrying a batch of war goods and some passengers to Vladivostok. According to shipping sources, the General Valery, which was previously leased by the Japanese authorities and has now expired, is scheduled to leave Shanghai at the end of the week and sail south, continuing to sail on the Shanghai-Saigon and Haiphong lines.

### New Ship on Shanghai-Ningbo Line, Hua Wan to Sail to Ningbo

In addition to the five ships currently sailing on the Shanghai-Ningbo line, namely the Hua, Wanji, Naruto, Haitong, and Changshan, the Hua Wan will join on the 21st of this month, i.e., on the maiden voyage to Ningbo on that day. Since the authorities of the two concessions have actively evacuated the population, there have been many passengers on each sailing to Ningbo. However, the number of people coming to Shanghai from Ningbo is small due to the restrictions on exports, and they all have local export permits and are limited to returning to Ningbo within a specified time.

### Rickshaw Puller Finds a Large Sum of Money, Unexpected Wealth Ultimately Not His, Affair Causes Imprisonment

Wang Shuqing, the general affairs director of Lianchang Bank at No. 301 Tianjin Road, hired a rickshaw at 2:30 PM on the 26th of last month, carrying reserve banknotes of 8,500 yuan to the Jinmen Hotel on Jing'an Temple Road. Upon alighting, he suddenly forgot the banknotes on the rickshaw, and the rickshaw number was not noted. He placed an advertisement offering a reward of 1,000 yuan to find it. The rickshaw puller who carried Wang was named Liu Qingshan, rickshaw number 3100. Liu was overjoyed upon finding the money and hurriedly pulled the rickshaw back to his home at No. 305 Chi Hong Road. After counting the amount, he hid it in a box and went out to bathe. Unexpectedly, while he was counting the money, a fellow rickshaw puller, Wei Yulin, saw it. Taking advantage of Liu's absence, Wei sneaked in, broke the lock, and stole 6,000 yuan. When Liu returned home and discovered the theft, he investigated and learned that Wei had stolen it. Because Wei was extremely poor and now had a box full of banknotes, Liu argued with him, leading to a conflict. The incident was detected by Peng Bingsheng, a Chinese detective from the Criminal Section of the Public Concession Police Department, who first arrested Liu and confiscated the remaining 2,000 yuan. He then arrested Wei at No. 29, Lane 209, Wuding Road, confiscating 900 yuan of stolen money. Xu Qingquan, a relative of Wei, was also arrested at his home, and 2,600 yuan of Wei's deposited money was confiscated. Another 1,500 yuan had been sent by Wei to his hometown, and Liu had already spent 500 yuan. All involved were taken into custody, pending further investigation to determine the remaining amount.

### Doctor Yu Xin'en Speaks on Child Nutrition

A child welfare seminar was held on the fourth floor of the Public Works Department's Tiantingfang building. Dr. Yu Xin'en was invited to speak on child nutrition, providing a detailed explanation of the various symptoms of malnutrition in children and its impact on their health and temperament. Charts were displayed in the venue, indicating that a lack of Vitamin A could cause symptoms such as dry eyes, while a lack of Vitamin B could cause symptoms such as dry beriberi and wet beriberi. Plants containing Vitamin A include spinach, peas, tomatoes, bananas, cabbage, carrots, corn, oranges, sweet potatoes, peppers, Chinese cabbage, clover, and alfalfa. Animal sources include lungs, liver, kidneys, and egg yolks. Plants containing Vitamin B include peanuts, potatoes, beans, rice bran, tomatoes, bananas, apples, radishes, green onions, spinach, and wheat bran. Animal sources include milk, eggs, liver, and kidneys.

### Subletting License Implementation Date Undecided, April 1 Deadline Unreliable, License Date Pending Official Announcement

The English-language "North China Daily News" reported on the 17th of this month that the Public Works Department had set a deadline of April 1 for landlords subletting properties within the Public Concession to register and obtain licenses. This caused panic and doubt among sub-landlords, who rushed to the police authorities to apply for registration but were unable to obtain clear instructions. According to the regulations on subletting licenses, the Public Works Department issued a public notice on February 25, stating only that disputes between sub-landlords and sub-tenants should not be referred to the Public Works Department until the implementation date of the license system was announced.

According to reliable sources, the date for the implementation of the subletting license application and registration system has not yet been decided. Therefore, the rumor that the registration deadline is April 1 is untrue. The implementation date for the issuance of this subletting license will be announced by the Public Works Department.

### Conclusion of Dispersal of Refugees, More than 4,000 People to be Dispersed Today

The dispersal of refugees from Shanghai's refugee shelters will come to an end today, as the grace period expires today. According to reports from the Datong News Agency, refugees will be dispersed today from four locations: Dunxin Road, North Zhejiang Road, Jisi Feier Road, and Tianhou Palace. Half have already been dispersed in succession. Of the remaining 4,000, the 200 orphans will be excluded and continue to receive relief from organizations such as the Jisheng Society. All others must be dispersed from the shelters. Today is the final day for those who have not received their dispersal allowance to collect it. The relevant police departments will also dispatch officers to assist. The refugee problem, which has persisted for four years, will thus come to a conclusion.

### Rising Prices in Shanghai Affecting the Lives of Monks and Laypeople

— Yi

There are hundreds of Buddhist temples and nunneries in this city, with thousands of monks and laypeople, forming an independent unit within the entire society. The living conditions of these people are often overlooked by the general public, especially by those who claim to have "no connection with monks and Taoists." In normal times, they "do not enter the Three Treasures Hall," and in times of crisis, they "do not embrace the Buddha's feet." Therefore, the mysteries of life in this special circle, to outsiders, seem unchanging, as mysterious as Zen principles, and difficult to understand.

Vocational

The sole livelihood of monks in ordinary temples is to chant scriptures, perform meritorious deeds, eliminate disasters, and pray for blessings. Each "vocational" temple has a monastic community—referred to as "masters"—ranging from a dozen to hundreds. When there are Buddhist ceremonies, cymbals, drums, and bells ring in unison, incense smoke swirls, and chanting continues all day. After the rituals are completed, the "accounting office" issues an invoice, with various items clearly itemized: number of masters, candles, vegetarian feast, tea and water, incense, and transportation costs, all to be paid. In addition to the regular bill, there are also "rewards," with guests and hosts rejoicing and everyone happy.

Large Expenses

With the high cost of everything in Shanghai, all living beings are affected, and the monks in the temples are no exception. A few large temples own land and do not rely solely on chanting scriptures for income. The remaining small temples rely entirely on donations from Buddhists, offerings from benefactors, and "gold contributions" from donors, which are few in number. The expenses of the temple are like those of ordinary shops or residences: rent, police donations, gas, water, and the seven necessities of life, all requiring cash. There are no other methods available simply because they belong to the Buddhist community.

Slow Seasons in Winter and Summer

Buddhist ceremonies in temples vary with the seasons. Spring and autumn are the peak months, with bright candlelights and loud chanting every day, and the main hall flourishing. In the hot summer months and the busy winter months, benefactors avoid mundane affairs and have no time to visit the temple to worship Buddha, so the temple's income naturally declines. In addition to "family members" using temples to liberate the souls of the deceased and commemorate ancestors, birthdays and other events are also based here. As for Buddhist birthdays, consecrations, scripture lectures, ordination ceremonies, the passing of old monks, and the succession of abbots, all large forests or a small temple in the corner, according to the resources, seriously, can not be ignored.

Expensive Clothing

Fine silks, wools, and serges are not what monks need, but wide-sleeved gray-black robes, long cloth socks, monk's shoes, and monk's hats are indispensable. At the current market price, old cloth sells for more than two yuan per foot. A monk's robe, including labor and materials, reportedly costs no less than forty or fifty yuan. A pair of long cloth socks costs about six or seven yuan, and good black cloth shoes with cloth soles cost more than thirty yuan. Undershirts and trousers are not included. All clothing needs must be provided by the monks themselves. Recently, the average income of ordinary masters in small temples is only about thirty to forty yuan. Although they have two thin and one dry bland meals of porridge and rice every day, the hardship of their lives can be imagined.

Becoming a Buddha Is Not Easy

The "becoming a Buddha" here does not refer to monks becoming Buddhas, but to the origin of the Buddha statues in the temple. The large and small Buddha statues in the temple are all made by the "Buddha-making place"—located in Xin Beidoucheng—and are carved from whole pieces of cedar wood. Currently, wood prices are soaring, supplies are cut off, gold prices are skyrocketing, and labor costs have doubled. Not to mention a large Buddha, even a small Bodhisattva costs hundreds of gold coins. If we want to build a giant Buddha statue like the one in Yangon, it will require the strength of the entire city! Buddha said that all sentient beings in the world are suffering. How wonderful!

### Demanding One Yuan in Debt, European Kills Man, Defendant Denies Murder

Li A'jin, a Tongzhou native residing at No. 5, Lane 459, Avenue Haig, is 44 years old and works as a rickshaw puller. On December 15th of last year, Li borrowed two yuan from Qiu Haitao, a Tongzhou native and foreman at the Zhu Shunji rickshaw company at No. 6, Lane 353, Rue Maber. By January 15th of this year, he had repaid one yuan. On the 7th of this month, after Li finished pulling his rickshaw and returned to the Zhu Shunji company, Qiu demanded the remaining one yuan from Li, but without success, a conflict ensued. After being beaten, Li returned home, vomiting blood and unable to continue pulling his rickshaw. He remained in bed for ten days. Unexpectedly, at 10:00 AM on the 17th, Li A'jin suddenly died. His wife, Li Wangshi, believed that her husband was beaten to death by Qiu Haitao and reported the incident to the New Concession Police Department. Detectives were dispatched to arrest Qiu and bring him to the police station. Under questioning, Qiu admitted to having a verbal argument with the deceased but denied physically assaulting him. He was ordered to be detained pending an examination of the body.

### Walk Carefully, Otherwise, You Will Be Punished According to the Rules

The French Municipal Council warned pedestrians yesterday, saying that recently, due to the scarcity of cars in the city, pedestrians are often careless when walking in the road or crossing the street. This causes many difficulties for bicycles, rickshaws, handcarts, and other vehicles, and many people gather at intersections or stand in the middle of the road and talk. They are unable to comply with the rules they used to follow before the disappearance of cars. This matter has attracted the attention of the French Municipal Council, which has instructed detectives to closely monitor pedestrians and warn the public that any pedestrian who disregards traffic regulations and obstructs traffic will be fined or otherwise punished, depending on the severity of the violation.

### Coal Shop Owner Killed, Stabbed Six or Seven Times

Zhang Dongqing, the 52-year-old Ningbo native owner of the Fuxing Coal Company at No. 51 Rue Galvani in the French Concession, lived in a room behind the hall. However, at around 6:30 AM yesterday, a person emptying the toilet bucket entered the room and discovered that Zhang had been stabbed to death in his bed. He had six or seven wounds to his head, chest, waist, and other parts of his body. The murderer was nowhere to be found. The incident was immediately reported to the French Police, who dispatched detectives to investigate. The body was transported by car to the coroner's office for examination, and an investigation is underway to track down the perpetrator and bring them to justice.

### Opening of Pinlang Road Area, Restoration of Traffic

The area near Pinlang Road and Xiaoshadu Road, within the jurisdiction of the Putuo Road Police Station in Western Shanghai, was closed by the authorities on the 5th of this month due to a terrorist incident. The closure has lasted for more than two weeks. It is now learned that the closed area was officially reopened by the authorities at 6:00 PM yesterday, restoring traffic.

### Please Investigate and Suppress, Goods Intercepted Along the Road

Recently, a large number of bandit-like figures, dressed like beggars, have been forming gangs along Yuchaqing Road and Avenue Edward VII, intercepting passing merchants and cargo vehicles carrying cigarettes and other goods. As a result, customers regard the area as dangerous, which has greatly affected the business of shops in the area, causing significant losses. It is learned that dozens of cigarette and department stores along Avenue Edward VII and Yuchaqing Road jointly requested the police authorities yesterday to add police posts in the area and conduct strict investigations to eliminate these bandits, in order to benefit merchants and maintain public order.

### Providing for Poor American Nationals within the American School

Currently, there are approximately 300 American nationals who have become impoverished due to the Pacific War. They are being cared for by American relief organizations in this city, which provide for their daily needs. Many Americans imprisoned in this city are also receiving partial or continuous assistance from American relief organizations. The American Food Distribution Center, located within the American School on Rue Petain, distributed no fewer than 500 meals yesterday morning to impoverished American nationals who are still residing in their homes. In addition, meals were also provided to impoverished American nationals residing within the American School. There are currently approximately 80 American nationals living in the American School, where they eat, sleep, and live within the school buildings. Therefore, the American School has a truly important role in the American relief organization in this city.

### Commodity Prices

The following table lists the average retail prices of commodities from February 16th to March 15th. This price list was compiled by the Public Works Department's Industrial and Social Affairs Office for employers to use as a reference for adjusting employee allowances.

### Street Scenes

— Yu Heyan

The western sunset has not completely faded, a crescent moon, half-hidden, lingers in the Orion constellation, as if gazing out the window; Sirius, the dog star, rays of light, swaying red and green, flashing at her side, just like wearing a ten-carat diamond ring.

The street lights on the road, now alone. In many places, one light on the left, one light on the right, show a wave of light in the calm. In order to save electricity, so that the Vega star in the Lyra constellation, without sleeping at night, full horsepower, spinning yarn weaving cloth, to the world to sell fine cloth of one hundred and seventy-eighty yuan a piece, unprecedented good price.

"Haha! Why are you following me so closely, reluctant to leave?"

"Ah! Sir! Just because the price of rice is expensive, the boss can't afford to buy rice, so he laid off the employees. I can't go back to my hometown, can't see my parents, can't take care of my wife, so I have to wander, on the street, doing that begging life. Poor me, I've been hungry from morning till dusk, I haven't eaten a six-grain cake, I've had to move three or four times."

"Hey! This is a burlap bag, I don't know what's in it?"

"I guess there's rice in the bag, and he's afraid of violating the law because it exceeds the retail quantity, so he hurriedly throws it away and runs away."

"No! Why is it a dark pile? I guess it's smuggled coal balls, afraid someone will catch up, temporarily hiding from the wind."

"No matter if it's rice or coal, I'll carry it away with you, this is heaven-sent gold, let's stage a 'Romulus and Remus pick up gold'!"

### This Year's Western Youth Volleyball Tournament - Registration Starts Tomorrow - Still Divided into Three Groups: Men's A, Men's B, and Women's

The 14th Western Youth Volleyball Invitational League invitation letters have been issued. This year, it is still divided into three groups: Men's A, Men's B, and the Women's group. Registration will begin tomorrow (Saturday). It is reported that the Soviet team has officially joined Group A. In addition, the Russian Overseas Chinese Association will also participate in the competition. This team unfortunately lost to Western Youth in the final decisive match last year, finishing as runner-up. Therefore, their strength is very strong. This year, Western Youth has given up joining Group A. Besides the original famous players of the Russian Overseas Chinese team, such as Leishev, Gaozug, Gaoman, the team has also obtained the assistance of Western Youth's Luo Qingu, Maitolis, Fulo, and Gu. Their fighting power has been further strengthened. It is yet to be determined whether the Chinese team, Yinghua, will join. According to Western Youth's Kaiji Milov, if there are too few participants in Group A, only Group B will be held, with each team limited to two Group A players to increase interest. As for the Women's group, the Youxing team, which has won four consecutive championships, will participate again this year. Western Youth will join Group B with three teams. In terms of strength, the Russian捕 (Russian capture) team is the strongest. The Chinese powerhouse, the White team, possesses famous players such as Zhang Deyuan and Shi Yin, which will definitely be a major concern for the Russian捕 team. The competition is expected to kick off in the Western Youth gymnasium at the beginning of next month.

### Gold Eagerly Seeking Liquidation - Regardless of Low Prices

The cash market in Shanghai is tight, and prices continue to fall. The price has retreated into the 17,000 yuan range. This is mainly because Jin Yuan Securities and Tong Kangyong are inclined to sell, due to unfavorable rumors about gold. Retail investors are scrambling to sell even more fiercely. Although Japanese military notes are still stable, there is no shortage of buyers to raise the price, but the price is still gradually falling. The mood of all parties is uncertain. The opening price in the morning was 18,200 yuan, which was 80 yuan lower than the closing price of the previous day. The price then went to 18,100 yuan. Securities companies such as Chengji and Decheng came to increase bids, raising the price to 18,350 yuan. Suddenly, a certain gold company commissioned Jin Yuan and Tong Kangyong, along with Yimao and Yongxiejie, to rush to sell. Negative rumors also arose, and many retailers rushed to get rid of their holdings. The downward trend became even sharper, plunging by 550 yuan, falling to 17,800 yuan. When news came that the Japanese military notes had risen to the 7 yuan mark, the market rebounded. Hefaji, Chengji, Defu, and retail investors all scrambled to buy, and the price was temporarily raised by 650 yuan to reach 18,450 yuan. After 11 o'clock, the downward trend resumed. Rumors of profit-taking sales became even more prevalent. Jin Yuan, Tong Kangyong, Shengda, Yonghefa, Yimao, Yong, and other securities companies competed to sell. Many floating orders were urgently cut, regardless of the low price, resulting in a sharp drop of 950 yuan, breaking the 18,000 yuan mark again. At 11:33, the price fell to a low of 17,500 yuan. Retail investors absorbed some of the holdings, and the price slightly rebounded. The closing price at noon was 17,650 yuan, which was 630 yuan lower than the closing price of the previous day. The difference for the day was 950 yuan. After closing, the price rose back to 17,800 yuan. Transaction volume was not strong. The jewelry gold price was quoted by Daxin and its counterparts at 50 yuan less per tael, at 1,850 yuan (purchase price reduced by 200 yuan). Silver was quoted at 20 yuan. The black market price of Laotianbao was 15 yuan, but there were no buyers. The price of a silver coin also retreated to the 10 yuan mark.

### January's Note Circulation - Presents Unprecedented Contraction

### Public Bond Resale More Active

The public bond grey market suddenly trended downward yesterday, because there were more sellers and very few takers. The downward trend became even more severe. Ruidu sold Category C bonds in particular. Yichang, Yitai, Dazhong, Gongmao, Zhongfu, Hongda, and others also sold as opportunities arose. However, the capacity of buyers like Tongli, Yuxing, Xinhua, and Tongxing was limited, and they seemed indifferent. The market price became increasingly weak. Categories A, D, and C all broke through the two major marks of 70 yuan and 60 yuan. Although Xinhua did not receive Category A bonds, Renchang specially supplied them. The situation did not stabilize, because Ruidu's sales had not yet been satisfied. On the other hand, transactions in other markets were active, and everyone abandoned this market for those. For a while, it may not be easy to stabilize the future. As a result, the price fell by as much as 1.05 yuan to 2 yuan. The transaction volume was only over 300,000 yuan. A concise table is listed below:

### Bananas (5)

— Gao Jiannong

More than 50 years ago, there was a famous "United Fruit Company" in the United States - the "Banana King" - using its abundant financial power and strong political skills, systematically and step by step cultivated bananas in Central America and the West Indies. These areas, which have always been barren and rife with yellow fever and heatstroke, have now become very prosperous places! Costa Rica, such a small country, alone has 23,000 hectares of banana fields, producing approximately 12 million bunches of bananas annually! As for the British island of Jamaica, it can also produce 15 million bunches annually. As a result, various South American countries have also followed suit. The production volume of Xiangshan and the Philippines is also increasing day by day. I wonder if the banana growers in our country's Fujian and Guangdong provinces will also work hard to catch up!

The chemical composition of bananas is: water accounts for 76%, carbohydrates - sugar and starch - account for 22%, protein accounts for 1.3%, fat accounts for 0.6%, and vitamins and minerals account for 0.8%. The country that consumes the most bananas in the world is the United States, which eats more than 45 million bunches every year. The second is the United Kingdom, which eats 12 million bunches every year. Other countries are far behind. ...

### Economic Chats

— Feng Liu

I have discussed diamonds twice, and I secretly suspect that the name of the diamond is related to the vajra mentioned in Buddhist scriptures. Therefore, I want to seek its trace to cite it as evidence. When I read the Book of Song of the Six Dynasties, the Kingdom of Kapilavastu of India in Yuanjia five years献 (presented) a diamond ring, a marquis gold ring, and other physical objects. At that time, it was 1484 years before the Republic of China era (428 years in the West). In the seventh year, the kingdom of Karadana again獻 (presented) a diamond ring. The ring is the ring of today, I have said before, transmitted from the southwest countries, probably among the kings of the southwest countries at that time quite a few used rings as seals, so it is similar to the present-day signet ring. When I read the Book of Sui, the Kingdom of Persia produced Fire Jade Diamond. Fire Jade is shaped like mica, the color is like purple gold, with radiance, separated it is like cicada wings, accumulated it is like the heavy folds of gauze. But the shape of the diamond is not detailed in the book. The Book of Tang, the Kingdom of India had a record of the shape of the diamond, saying it is similar to amethyst, tempered hundreds of times without dissolving, can cut jade. The New Book of Tang, the Biography of the Kingdom of Funan, also said that it produced diamonds, like amethyst, growing on stones at the bottom of the water, people dive into the water to take it, can carve jade, knock it with　 (a missing character) horn, then　 (a missing character). That is, the so-called antelope horn can break the diamond. It also said that the kingdom of Fulin has a night-shining wall and a bright moon pearl, I don't know if they are diamond-like treasures.

As described in the historical books, the diamond is undoubtedly a diamond. When I ask for it in Buddhist books, the Lotus Sutra of the Wonderful Dharma also lists diamonds among the various treasures. It is also transformed into 84,000 lotus flowers of various treasures, saying that Jambudani gold is used as　(a missing character), silver as leaves, and diamond as stamens. The stamen is the pistil of the flower, and diamond is used as the stamen, taking its similar granules. Then Shakyamuni Buddha knew of the existence of the diamond, and knew that it was a precious item, so he used it to metaphorize that the meaning of the scriptures cannot be broken, as the treasure among treasures. Recently, I also read the lectures on the Diamond Sutra by layman Jiang Weinong (which was given to me by layman Jiang Zhuzhuang)　 (To be continued)

Spring and Autumn

### Film Companies in Various Countries - Start Handling Closure

— Taixu

Film Stock Exhausted!

After December 8th of last year, various businesses were seriously affected. The biggest problem in the film industry is, of course, film stock. At that time, it was impossible to accurately count how much film stock was left in Shanghai. Because each company had some inventory of its own, and small hoarders also had some "savings," and it was generally expected that Japanese film could also be shipped to Shanghai. Therefore, the filming work of various companies has never stopped, and they have tried to save as much film as possible for each new film.　 For example, the length of each film was previously around 10,000 feet, but it was changed to around 9,000 feet. NG was reduced as much as possible, and some company authorities limited directors to using only 12,000 feet of film for each film. In order to extend the life of domestic films, the waste of exceeding tens of thousands of feet of film for each film as before should no longer be discovered.

Although the domestic film industry is operating so miserably, the fact that film is being used up foot by foot is ironclad. Starting from the previous month, the monthly film production of each film company in Shanghai was limited to six. The distribution ratio is: Yihua one film, Guohua one film, Guolian (i.e., Xinhua 　Xin　Cheng) three films. In fact, at that time, the film stock was decreasing like rice. According to the news obtained yesterday, if there is no new turning point, the domestic Lei shadow will inevitably be completely stopped in the future.

In addition to the unfinished works being rushed to completion, the set of Yue　's "Mysterious Girl郎" had already been built, and was also dismantled yesterday. Yihua Company also only has three unfinished works - "Tears on the Land of Longing," "Mandarin Duck Tears," and "School Scenery" - continuing to work, and the parts of "Grand Hotel" that have already been filmed have been decided to be sacrificed. Jin Xing has one "Out of the Cage" and "Turbulent Times Scenery." Guohua's "Lin Daiyu" has not been started because Zhou　 hurt her leg while riding a bicycle. It is expected that these last few films of each company can maintain the use of the first-run cinemas in Shanghai for two or three months.

After the companies close, the panic of nearly a thousand people in Shanghai from　　 can be imagined. The only way out is 濱 (near) drama. Fortunately, the atmosphere of drama is still quite strong recently, and there are already several groups in the process of organizing individually, but finding a venue is also quite difficult. Therefore, some groups may develop to other ports. - The details of this new development can be detailed 　告 (reported) in two months.

The drama groups currently performing include:　 Fei's Meiyi Troupe, Carlton's Art Society, Hongbao's Weiming Drama Society, and the Eighth Art Troupe, which will soon perform "Martyrdom" at the Lyceum. The Eighth Art Troupe was originally of a short-term nature, but due to this change, it may be decided to perform for a long time. The contract between Meiyi and　 Fei was originally until the end of this month, but recently there has been cooperation with Yao Ke, with the intention of entering the Lyceum. I don't know what changes there are now, and it is difficult to predict for a while.

In addition to the above-mentioned venues where dramas can be performed, new venues seem to be not easy to obtain. However, according to people in the film industry, the Grand Shanghai and Huguang theaters are two ideal drama theaters in terms of equipment and transportation. This estimate is inevitably premature, but it is originally easiest to convert a cinema into a drama theater. After March, the situation in Shanghai will inevitably not be 　測 (measured) as it is now.

### Sailing in the Same Storm

— He Jia Zhi

(2) Sorrow and Joy

"The multitude denies but confirms," everyone comforted Weicheng, saying that Mrs. Ye Da was much better after Lin Shaobang gave her an injection. She had been a little short of breath just now, but now the shortness of breath has subsided a little. 　Zhen, with red eyes, carried a 　 cane chair over and let Weicheng sit half-sitting, looking at Mrs. Ye Da. Weicheng seemed to have returned from a trip, waking up from a dream, asking if she had taken her medicine, if she had taken her medicine. Mrs. Ye Er said, "With　 Zhen here, one person is worth three or four people to serve, so rest assured."

Mrs. Li You　 came too, and the eldest aunt　 brought her youngest child. People from the front and back houses all came to visit, all saying how good Mrs. Ye Da was to others. When it was time for dinner, Weicheng still said he wasn't hungry. The family members seemed to not allow Weicheng to not be hungry, and forced him to eat, but he only drank a　 thin bowl of porridge. Several lamps were lit in the room, brightly lit. In theory, those who didn't　 rest last night should be able to rest tonight, but Mrs. Ye Er, from the voice of a person who doesn't agree with each other, knew that tonight was the most critical moment, saying: "Eldest sister-in-law will get better after tonight." Invisibly, she　托 (entrusted) that everyone should take care tonight and not neglect it. Weicheng always had a stone pressing on his heart　, he　 ran turned around and asked: "Where's Juzhen?" Mrs. Ye Er said: "　Zhen, she's gone. She's also a poor child. Her uncle, Fei Changhe, how can he compare to厲 (Li) family's uncle. If she doesn't go back to her uncle's house, all kinds of rumors will be made up. She's gone."

### Another Person Jumping Off a Building

— Han Fufang

Recently, there have been so many "stories" of people jumping off buildings, 猛　(violently striking) telephone poles, taking poison... I really can't count them all. The reason for this is nothing more than being forced by life. This is the case for jumping off buildings, and it is also the case for violently striking telephone poles and taking poison.

"Everyone has a heart of compassion." Therefore, there are indeed quite a few who sigh and weep. However, those who lack a feeling of "I am like him" account for the majority. Alas, lamentable!

A friend came to visit and, after talking about oil and rice, also mentioned the matter of suicide. A friend vividly told the story of a jump: "A young man in a short cloth shirt jumped down from a tall building and died when he hit the ground. Probably because he fell very painfully, the legs of the deceased clenched and raised very high." After the friend finished speaking, he solemnly added an explanation of the identity of the suicide: "It is said that the deceased's long robe and 직공呢 (direct tribute wool) shoes were all taken off upstairs." I have heard many stories of suicide, and I feel indifferent, but the last explanation cannot help but make you "feel something."

Suicide is not the best policy, and it is even more cowardly and confused to be afraid of making a　(missing character) by suicide and hide clothes and hats to prevent people from identifying the truth.

"Die to save face and suffer alive." This is a very good proverb. However, there are not many who can be warned by this. Is this jumper also not the case? It seems that suicide is only limited to the short blue cloth shirt class. If you commit suicide in a long robe, it is really detrimental to decency.

It is said that suicide requires courage, otherwise you cannot "die." However, this courage is limited to the moment of "death." As for the courage to commit suicide in a robe, there is an exception, and it is even more out of the question when hoping to transplant the courage to "die" to the courage to "live."

Suicide is never the best policy, I hope that people who want to commit suicide will take good care of themselves!

### Double Reed

— Zefu

It is said that the double reed originated with Huang Fuchen. Huang was 　 a well-known person, with an extraordinarily ugly face and a lame foot. At first, he was also a storyteller, able to imitate the movements of various characters alone, so he was named Double Huang. Later, it began to be divided into two people, imitating one person. (See Li Feishu's "Memories by the Plum Tree"). Or it is said that Huang was an amateur actor in Beijing, who performed this play with his brother, hence the name Change Huang. (See Qing Wu's "Flower Teahouse between Beijing and Tianjin"). According to the two existing manuscript copies of Zhang's Double Reed, one of them says: "We are learning from the deceased businessman Huang Fuchen, and people call him Huang Laotai." Then Huang Fuchen seems to be Huang Fuchen. This kind of storytelling is of the same nature as crosstalk, specializing in making people laugh and enjoy themselves. However, crosstalk is a dialogue between two people, while double reed is one sitting in front and one hidden behind. The one sitting is the clown, and the one hidden is the straight character. The straight character talks, laughs, sings behind, and the clown performs in front with the sound, gesticulating, as if he is the one speaking and singing. However, in the middle of the performance, the straight character often deliberately pretends to be 打　(missing character), so that the clown cannot perform, so as to change other　(missing character) programs. Therefore, in one 塲(performance), sometimes speaking and laughing, sometimes singing, there is no plot at all, and no story is worth telling. When performing, there is nothing other than the awakening wood; only when singing, the straight character occasionally adds 彈 (plucking) strings to help the rhythm.

### Sales Knowledge

— Guo Rui

When a waiter in a coffee shop asks if you want an egg in your milk powder, you almost instinctively say "no." However, a clerk trained by Elmer Wheeler, the creator of "Tested Selling Sentences," would pick up an egg in each hand and ask if you want one or two. At that point, almost without thinking, you would say "one," and the cash register would record an extra sum of money. Wheeler provided hundreds of these advantageous dialogues to owners of gas stations, restaurants, department stores, and necklace shops, making him famous in the history of applied psychology.

"Don't ask people if they want it," Wheeler said, "ask them which one they want." Never give customers a chance to decide whether to buy; don't ask questions they can easily answer "no" to. At a soda fountain in Brooklyn, the waiters always ask people who want Coca-Cola if they want a large or small bottle; few people want a large one. After Wheeler's tests, the waiters only asked, "Large bottle?" Indeed, two out of every five times, it was a large bottle.

Thus, more than a decade ago, Wheeler's new profession was born – to draft the most effective sentences for selling goods. When Wheeler and his staff work, they don't immediately come up with ready-made slogans. They spend a long time listening, recording, and modifying.

Wheeler's activities are not limited to the vicinity. He advised cleaning workers to bring soap and towels into the house, and before touching any furniture, first ask where they can wash their hands. According to his suggestion, laundry businesses instructed all female shop assistants, whether married or not, to call themselves "Mrs." So-and-so. He also advised vacuum cleaner salesmen to first find birds, dogs, and children as soon as they enter a house. If they find a canary, the salesman's "standard phrase" is "Does it sing?" If there is a dog, he should ask its name; if there are children, he should ask their names and ages. One salesman used this method to get 92 percent of the people who had "Solicitors and beggars not allowed" signs on their doors to buy his vacuum cleaner. Once, Wheeler happened to tell a dog owner that a sign saying "Beware of dog" was not as effective as "Beware of hungry dog." (Abridged translation from "Reader's Digest")
