In short, "There are not only many obstacles between Britain and India, but also a gulf has been drawn, separating each other. This situation is worse than it was a few weeks ago. At a time when we urgently need to concentrate manpower and material resources, and call on all who can assist us to cooperate sincerely, such an unfortunate incident has occurred, which is truly regrettable."

### Turkish President İsmet Inönü Travels to Istanbul

Ankara, 27th (Domei News Agency) - Turkish President İsmet Inönü returned here yesterday after inspecting Central Anatolia and the Black Sea coast and then left for Istanbul. At the same time, German Ambassador Papen arrived here on Tuesday from his summer residence in Therapia to discuss matters with Turkish Foreign Minister Menemencioğlu, who will fly back to the Turkish capital today. This trip by the Turkish President is of great importance, as it is widely believed to be closely related to the Turkish government's policy of ensuring the neutrality of the waterway between the Black Sea and the Mediterranean. In view of the German army's advance in the Caucasus and the expansion of the war zone, Turkey's situation has become increasingly complicated. Yesterday was the twentieth anniversary of Turkey's victory over Greece. Turkish newspapers published articles promoting Turkey's spirit of independence. According to neutral observers, Turkey's neutrality policy has not changed, and Turkey will undoubtedly formulate appropriate measures to deal with the imminent emergency situation.

Istanbul, 26th (Central News Agency) - Today is the 20th anniversary of Turkey's recovery of lost territories and its war against Greece. Newspapers published articles stressing that Turkey should maintain its glorious independence. Neutral persons here recently pointed out the difficulties of Turkey's current situation and the Turkish government's policy to cope with it as follows: 1. It is rumored that the Soviet Black Sea Fleet seems to have escaped to Batum. Now that the general trend in the Caucasus has been decided, there are only two options for the Black Sea Fleet: one is to escape to Turkish waters for protection, and the other is to escape to the Mediterranean to merge with the Allied fleet. However, at that time, the Turkish government will adopt a neutral attitude towards the Black Sea Fleet's escape into Turkish waters. The Turkish president's inspection of the eastern waters this time is also an inspection of the defense situation. 2. After the Caucasus war situation became urgent, Britain immediately strengthened the defense of Iran and Iraq on the instructions of Churchill, appointed Wilson as the commander of the British forces in Iran and Iraq, and Linstead as the commander of the 15th Army in Iraq, refreshing the lineup of the guiding department, and at the same time mobilizing the Syrian and Palestinian troops in an attempt to strengthen the defense of Iran and Iraq. Turkey bears the brunt. There are Axis troops in the Balkans, and British troops on the eastern and southern borders. Since the outbreak of the Caucasus War, there has been a risk of major incidents in northern Turkey, so Turkey's situation is difficult, and the feeling is that there is no way to deal with it.

### Heavy Losses of Allied Ships: Serious Shipping Problems

London, 26th (Havas News Agency) - Reuters recently published a dispatch from a correspondent in Washington stating that shipping problems are becoming increasingly serious. The progress of building new ships is far less than the number of ships sunk in the high seas by Axis submarines or aircraft. At the beginning of this year, thanks to Britain's efforts, all parties were very optimistic about shipping problems and hoped that they would improve by mid-summer of this year. Even the Allies could compensate for the losses before 1942. By this time, if no miracle occurs, the Allies will have fewer ships in all of 1943 than on January 1, 1942. In the past few months, the method of escorting merchant ships has been improved repeatedly, and the shipping problem has improved slightly, but the heavy losses suffered by the Allied side due to the Axis submarines' activity on the east coast of the United States have made the Allies suffer heavy losses.

Washington, 26th (Havas News Agency) - The Navy Department announced that a small Dutch cargo ship was sunk by a torpedo fired by an Axis submarine in the Caribbean Sea a few days ago. All rescued crew members have arrived at a port of a friendly country.

### German Courts at All Levels Will Be Reorganized: Dr. Schirach Speaks

Berlin, 16th (Havas News Agency) - The new Minister of Justice, Dr. Schirach, told reporters today that the need for a thorough reform of our country's judicial administration has been a long-standing one. However, the spirit of German legislation will not change in any way, and courts at all levels must also be reorganized, but judicial independence must remain the same. Judges must still be free from domination, and their freedom of action must be expanded. As for the current state of the People's Court and the German Supreme Court, it is not intended to change them.

Berlin, 27th (Haitong News Agency) - German Minister of Justice Schirach, who was ordered to draft a new German law, will be included in the powers granted to the head of state by the Reichstag on April 26, 1942. The head of state can use this power to require every German to fulfill his obligations. Those who violate it can be slightly fined. The "Frankfurter Zeitung" commented that every new era has its own laws. National Socialism is a revolutionary movement and cannot be an exception. The free laws of the 19th century focused on individual rights, while National Socialist laws should focus on the entire political, social and cultural aspects of the country.

### Large-Scale Tank Battles on Both Sides of Stalingrad: Red Army Takes Offensive in the Middle: Reportedly Advanced 45 Li

Stockholm, 27th (Domei News Agency) - Large-scale tank battles took place yesterday northwest and southwest of Stalingrad. The threat to the north of the city is particularly severe because German tank formations and mechanized infantry units are crossing the Don River in large numbers, reportedly only 30 miles from the city. Millions of Red Army soldiers are preparing for a decisive battle to defend the city. Although the fierce battle has not yet arrived, it is not far away. According to a report from the Vichy radio station, on the southwestern front, the German army has passed Pishchnovka and is no more than 25 miles from Stalingrad. Also, according to yesterday's report, the Red Army suddenly took the offensive near the center of the Soviet Union and Kalinin. It is still too early to judge whether this new action is to divert German forces or a separate offensive. According to what was revealed in last night's Moscow special communiqué, this move was launched in the Lezhev area two weeks ago. The first blow has pushed the German army back 40 to 50 kilometers.

Stockholm, 27th (Havas News Agency) - The latest news from the Eastern Front is that the German army in the western district of the southern route continues to mop up enemy troops in the Taman Peninsula. Yesterday, it occupied a number of strongholds. At the same time, the German army is advancing towards the port of Anapa. Part of the Red Army in the port has withdrawn to Novorossiysk, but the port will be difficult to defend for long. At this moment, the German army is approaching a certain point where the Krasnodar Railway intersects in the southeast. On the Caucasus front, the German army occupied several mountain peaks. Moscow acknowledged that Grozny is in danger.

Bern, 26th (Havas News Agency) - The Basel News recently published a dispatch from a correspondent in Berlin stating that the important mountain passes in the Caucasus, from north to south, are now under German control. The most important of these are the following three: The Naibal Pass, which leads from Mount Elbrus directly to the north of the Black Sea port of Poti; The second pass, 70 miles east of Mount Elbrus, which leads from Malchick City directly to Kuts City; The third pass, the most important of them all, connects with the highway from Ordzhonikidze City to Tiflis City. According to news from Berlin, after the mountain troops under General Lanz occupied the peaks of Mount Elbrus, the German flag was hoisted in the high sky. Another German division is engaged in mopping-up operations in order to eliminate the remaining enemy troops. Another small team of mountain troops led by Captain Grotte set off from Chergassk City on the 13th of this month, preparing to go to the Mount Elbrus area to scout and annihilate the remnants of the Red Army in the upper reaches of the Kuban River. The army repeatedly clashed with the Red Army near the mountain foothills, that is, the Kuban River, and finally broke through the Red Army's position on the 15th and advanced into the isolated Wuxugarang City and began to climb high mountains. Also, because of the failure to find mules and horses, German soldiers carried weapons, ammunition, and food up the stairs. By the 17th of this month, they had climbed to a mountain 13,000 feet high and found the Soviet meteorological station there, which was still guarded by the Red Army. The garrison saw the sudden arrival of the German army and was caught off guard, and was disarmed by the German army. In the following days, the weather on the mountain was bad, and fire, wind, and snow occurred. After annihilating several Red Army teams, the German army continued to climb high mountains.

### German Forces Unleash Four Thousand Bombing Raids on Stalingrad, Enveloping the City in Smoke and Fire

Soviet Border Region, 26th (Havas News Agency Dispatch) - Today marks the 439th day of the Soviet-German War. Amidst the grim realities, German forces are advancing on Stalingrad from both the northwest and southwest. The city is ablaze, thick smoke billowing everywhere. The dry grass on both banks of the Volga River has also been ignited by German bombing, and the city's factories and fuel reserves have been decimated by waves of enemy aircraft. It is estimated that the German side has deployed over four thousand aircraft, each conducting up to ten sorties day and night. According to German sources, the city's factories have already begun evacuation. Workers who have not been evacuated along with the machinery are participating in the construction of defensive works. German forces northwest of the city have severed the railway line between Stalingrad and Moscow. German forces in the southwest have also broken through Soviet lines. After thirty-six hours of close combat, Soviet forces have been forced to abandon their defensive line, which extends to a depth of twenty miles. These German forces are now only ten miles from the city. There are still some isolated pockets of Soviet troops behind German lines, but they have now been encircled. Although Soviet forces attempted to provide relief, they were repelled by the German forces. Soviet forces east of Kremskaya attempted to force crossings of the Don River on several occasions, but were repulsed by Italian troops. The general impression is that, although Soviet resistance remains strong, signs of exhaustion are beginning to emerge, and morale is wavering. On the Caucasus front, German Bavarian mountain troops have now occupied mountain peaks and are about to descend into the valleys of Georgia and Dagestan. All the passes in the Caucasus are only defended by Cossack cavalry, so the German advance has encountered no difficulty. In addition, Soviet forces in the mountainous region along the Black Sea coast from Tuapse to Novorossiysk have resisted fiercely. Soviet forces on the eastern shore of the Kerch Strait are still putting up a desperate fight while besieged, but it is only a matter of time before they surrender or die. It is still difficult to predict the future plans of the German High Command. However, the National Socialist Party's newspaper, the "People's Observer," recently published a map showing the route to Tbilisi, the capital of Georgia, hinting at the possible German objective. Tbilisi is strategically important, being the key to the southern valleys of the Caucasus and a center for oil and manganese production. The German forces may wait for the fall of the port of Novorossiysk before advancing along the railway from that port to Batumi, in order to avoid the arduous mountain roads that would exhaust men and horses. The Soviet claim that German forces bombed Tbilisi is not confirmed. In the areas of Rzhev and Vyazma in the central sector, Soviet forces are constantly reinforcing the front lines with fresh troops, but have so far failed to break through the German defenses.

### Soviet Forces Vigorously Defend Key Positions, Hindering German Advance in the Caucasus

German Führer's Headquarters, 27th (Haitong News Agency Dispatch) - This afternoon's German war bulletin stated that Soviet forces are fiercely defending key positions in the Caucasus in an attempt to halt our advance. West of Stalingrad, Soviet forces launched fierce counterattacks against the German vanguard, but were heavily defeated and repulsed. The German Air Force supported ground troops in combat, destroying forty Soviet tanks. Near Kaluga and Rzhev, enemy forces launched renewed attacks, but were driven back by German counterattacks. Northwest of Mtsensk, German counterattacks pushed the enemy back to their original positions. There were only localized battles around Leningrad. Forty Soviet artillery positions were destroyed by German assault troops. German fighter planes and anti-aircraft units shot down a total of 153 Soviet aircraft on August 25th and 26th. Nine of our planes failed to return to base.

Berlin, 27th (Haitong News Agency Dispatch) - Today's German war bulletin stated that German forces and their allies, despite fierce Soviet resistance and difficult terrain, continue to advance and have occupied several more key positions in the Caucasus mountains.

Moscow, 27th (Allied News Agency Dispatch) - The Soviet Information Bureau issued a war bulletin on the 26th stating that our forces engaged in fierce battles with German forces on the 26th southeast of Krasnaya, northwest of Stalingrad, northeast of Kotelnikovo, and south of Brovarky, Mostok, and Trakhanovski. Northwest of Stalingrad, our forces are preventing the Axis advance. Supported by the Air Force, the Axis forces are constantly launching fierce attacks on our positions.

Stockholm, Sweden, 27th (Haitong News Agency Dispatch) - According to well-informed sources in London, Churchill is expected to report to the House of Commons on his visit to Moscow within two weeks.

Stockholm, Sweden, 27th (Haitong News Agency Dispatch) - According to the London correspondent of the Swedish "Daily News," all discussions at the Moscow conference were based on the assumption that the Soviet Union would continue to fight this winter. The negotiations also took into account the fall of Stalingrad. While the fall of the city was recognized as a major blow to the Soviet Union, it was believed that Soviet forces could hold the Caucasus line. However, if German forces were to occupy the Baku oilfields, London believes that this would be a catastrophe for the Soviet Union. In addition to increased supplies of arms, Britain and the United States will also provide food. Allied special weapons in Iran will also be transported to the Soviet Union, but British and American troops will not be deployed in the Caucasus to assist in combat. However, tanks and aircraft will soon be transported to the Soviet Union. As for a second front, it is unlikely to materialize before next year, but by then, the number of German troops on the Western Front may double to about sixty divisions.

London, 26th (Havas News Agency Dispatch) - Prime Minister Churchill met today with General Eisenhower, Commander of the U.S. Expeditionary Force to Europe, and held talks for over an hour.

Therefore, the opening of a second front in West Asia appears increasingly possible. News from Baghdad also reports that British forces stationed in Iraq are constructing defenses on the Turkish-Iraqi border.

Bern, Switzerland, 26th (Haitong News Agency Dispatch) -

British troop strength has also been increased. According to news from the capital of Iraq, Indian and Iraqi troops have been dispatched to the border between Iraq and Turkey to build fortifications.

Bern, Switzerland, 26th (Havas News Agency Dispatch) - According to the German "People's Observer," Britain is now trying to draw Iran into the vortex of war. In view of the deteriorating situation in the Caucasus, Britain and the Soviet Union are exerting great pressure on the Iranian government to take extreme measures, a move supported by the United States.

### Prominent Local Merchants and Philanthropists Organize Centralized Fundraising, Abolishing Separate Solicitations by Charities, with a Fundraising Target of Five Million Dollars

The "Shanghai Times" reports that prominent Chinese merchants and philanthropists in the city are currently developing a plan to centralize fundraising for various charitable organizations and completely abolish separate solicitations by individual charities. Their initial fundraising target for the first six months is five million dollars. They have secured the support of the authorities in both the International Settlement and the Chinese-administered areas and have formed a Poverty and Disease Relief Association, which plans to start fundraising on September 10th. The new organization will not take over the activities of the city's many charitable organizations, but intends to raise sufficient funds during the fundraising period to distribute to relief organizations, orphanages, soup kitchens, and hospitals, and to provide assistance to educational institutions. This will allow the directors of these organizations to focus on promoting the welfare of those relying on relief. The charitable organization is led by a board of seven directors, and its working procedures are divided into five points: taking responsibility for the care of orphans, supporting hospitals, preventing epidemics with special facilities, subsidizing schools, and providing porridge and rice in the winter. It is expected that after the organization begins its work, its activities will expand to all aspects of charitable work and will also support foreign charitable organizations.

### The Salvation Army Begins Repatriation of Child Beggars; Child Beggars Account for the Largest Number of Inmates in Beggar Shelters

The "Shanghai Times" reports that Major Walker of the Salvation Army recently told reporters that the Salvation Army, in cooperation with the city authorities, has recently begun repatriating child beggars. As of yesterday (August 26th), six child beggars had been repatriated to their places of origin. Each repatriation requires separate investigation, so while he hopes to expand this activity, it is quite time-consuming. Yesterday, two children were repatriated to Ningbo, including a sixteen-year-old girl who had been lured to Shanghai with the promise of a job, only to be sold into a brothel. Unable to bear the suffering, she escaped and, unable to return home, resorted to begging. She was sent by the police to the Salvation Army beggar shelter, which currently houses 370 beggars, of whom 350 are child beggars. The shelter has now installed a soybean grinder, which began operating yesterday and is able to provide soymilk to the child beggars. As for the Salvation Army shelter on Xiamen Road, it provides food to 300 beggars daily. The Salvation Army also shelters six foreign beggars, it is said.

### Chinese Evacuation Committee Announces Work on Repatriating and Relieving Citizens; Investigations Are Strict, Application Procedures Are Swift, and More Than 2,000 People Have Been Repatriated

The Shanghai Municipal Council's Chinese Evacuation Committee is sparing no effort in its work to evacuate the population. It has been half a month since it began repatriating and relieving impoverished citizens of this city. In order to understand the actual situation of the committee's work, a reporter from the Datong News Agency visited Mr. Chen Junhong, a member of the Shanghai Municipal Council and director of the Chinese Evacuation Committee, yesterday. Mr. Chen received the reporter and made the following remarks:

Repatriation and Relief Work Carried Out Strictly

Since the Chinese Evacuation Committee began operating on February 9th of this year, it has always made the greatest efforts in its evacuation work. For example, in the past, half-price certificates were issued and groups of citizens were sent away. The committee has provided great convenience and assistance to citizens leaving Shanghai. This repatriation and relief work is merely another form of the committee's evacuation work. The motivation for this repatriation and relief work stems from the fact that there are many citizens in this city who wish to return to their hometowns but are unable to afford it. Therefore, the committee is extremely strict in its review of this repatriation and relief work. Citizens who are deemed to have good economic capacity are rejected, but in terms of all application investigation and approval procedures, the committee strives for speed so that citizens can leave Shanghai as soon as possible.

Increases and Decreases in Relief Funds for Group Submissions

Since the repatriation and relief work began on August 13th, more than 2,000 people have applied to the committee as of August 27th. The committee has completed investigations and approved more than 400 people, totaling more than 6,000 yuan. In recent days, more people have come to apply than before, and many groups, such as the Shandong Guild, the Hubei Native Place Association, the Xiangshan Native Place Association, the Three Religions Righteousness Association, and the Shaoxing Native Place Association, have also submitted a large number of applications. Most of the applicants are disabled, unemployed, and sick. Although the standard for relief funds is one-third of the total travel expenses, the committee, in order to adapt to the circumstances, can also carefully examine the economic situation of the applicants and make appropriate increases or decreases.

Deadline in One Month

Finally, Mr. Chen solemnly told the reporter that the repatriation and relief work is scheduled for only one month and will end on September 12th. Impoverished citizens of this city who may not be aware of the repatriation and relief work should quickly go to the Chinese Evacuation Committee at No. 277, Fuzhou Road, Shanghai Municipal Council Building, to inquire about the details, otherwise they will miss the opportunity, which is very regrettable. The application procedure is extremely simple. After obtaining an application form from the committee and filling it out, it can be sent to the committee after being guaranteed by the head of the Pao or head of the Jia in the place of residence, confirming that the applicant is an impoverished citizen and is about to return to his hometown. After the committee investigates and confirms that the application is genuine, the appropriate relief funds will be issued.

### Lecture on Confucius' Teachings at the Grand Light Cinema

— Xin'an

For five years, I hadn't stepped foot into the Grand Light Cinema. But since seeing the announcement of a special lecture to commemorate Confucius' birthday, I very much wanted to hear what Nakayama Kyūshirō had to say in his "Japanese Way and the Teachings of Confucius." Although I don't understand Japanese, fortunately there was translation, which increased my courage to attend. Around twelve o'clock, my son said to me, "If you want to go, you should go earlier. At your pace, walking to the Grand Light might take half an hour, and you might miss out because it's full." I thought that since it was a lecture on Confucius' teachings, and the Grand Light had many seats, it wouldn't matter if I went a little later. But unexpectedly, when I arrived in front of the Grand Light, the clock at the racecourse was pointing to half-past twelve. I had just entered the Grand Light, and indeed, there were many others arriving before and after me. After walking into the hall, from back to front, from left to right, I can say I went around once, and finding a seat was truly difficult. Finally, I managed to find a spot in the very last row, which was fortunate. In the venue, there were people ranging from babies in arms to those with full heads of white hair, those in short coats and long robes, and of course, women, young children, and youths. I then realized my son was right, and my own view was a mistake of the times; it was precisely because after the lecture, there was also a Great East Asia War film to watch.

With so many people, and many small children, those sitting in the back often heard the creaking of chairs as people stood up, and the sounds of children talking, which mixed in with the sounds of the lecture from the front. Although I concentrated intently on listening, I still couldn't hear everything clearly at times, which was somewhat disappointing for this trip.

Nakayama Kyūshirō's lecture lasted a full two hours, with detailed citations and thorough reasoning. Many points made me feel ashamed of myself. He generally said that Confucius's concepts of wisdom, benevolence, and courage (the so-called wisdom, benevolence, and courage, meaning being fond of learning is close to wisdom, practicing diligently is close to benevolence, and knowing shame is close to courage) and sacrificing one's life in danger, sacrificing oneself for benevolence, are in line with the martial spirit of Japan. Moreover, a certain Japanese general often encouraged his subordinates with "it is not courageous to fail to do what is right," showing that Confucius's thoughts and spirit have deeply penetrated the Japanese psyche. In addition, he talked about sufficient food and soldiers, and the courage of Zilu. Mr. Nakayama has indeed studied the books of Confucius extensively.

Secondly, he talked about Confucius' painstaking efforts to respect the king and his ideas of loyalty to the ruler, narrating them one by one, believing that Confucius never stopped thinking about honoring the Zhou dynasty and making it the ruler of the world for generations. He believed that honoring the unbroken imperial line and the Japanese people's loyalty and love for their country are in line with the spirit of Confucianism. He also solemnly encouraged us Chinese, saying, "Although China now has a different form of government, loyalty is still needed, that is, loyalty to the country." This is a summary of the main points of his speech. But China is trying to forcibly restrict the scope of the word "loyalty" to the two words "loyalty to the ruler," saying that Confucius's way of loyalty to the ruler is not in line with modern China, and using this as an excuse to overthrow Confucianism, even finding the word "loyalty" annoying to hear. This is truly ridiculous. One must understand that the character "ruler" (君) is composed of "尹" (yin, to govern) and "口" (mouth), meaning someone who speaks and issues orders, and does not necessarily contain the stench of emperors. Those with shallow views find "loyalty" inconvenient, but unexpectedly, Mr. Nakayama Kyūshirō has the same intention as our Chinese Sun Yat-sen in promoting China's inherent moral skills. He earnestly encourages us, which we should accept and be grateful for.

Speaking of the two characters "Zhongshan" (中山, Sun Yat-sen's name), I can't help but think back to a kind of commemoration of Mr. Sun's escape to Japan for the revolution. Today, Mr. Nakayama Kyūshirō also elaborates on the change of dynasty and generation through revolution, but he has his own standpoint.

Speaking of loyalty, it is connected to filial piety. Some say that loyalty and filial piety cannot coexist, and loyal ministers often come from families of filial sons. The Chinese value "filial piety," which I dare say no philosopher has ever dreamed of. As for the meaning of filial piety, not to mention the Classic of Filial Piety, it is also explained vividly in other classics. But forty years ago, the Chinese were stuck in the poison of xenophobia, seeing Western learning as worthless, indiscriminately rejecting it. And for the past forty years, they have been poisoned by "Western infatuation," regardless of whether it is good or bad, as long as it is "foreign goods," they say it is good without making any choice, and they say their own things are bad, discarding them all. It's truly like hiding a fortune ticket in a bamboo tube and throwing it into the river, striving to be different. They themselves are not filial to their parents, yet they want others to be unfilial. Why do they want to be like this? Because they think that filial piety is not talked about by Westerners, so they want to reject it. Alas, do you think that's pitiful or not!

Finally, he also talked about Shanghai being a major commercial port in East Asia, so he also talked about Confucius's economic thoughts, such as Zigong's "guesses are always right" and "there is a great way to make a fortune." He used the Biography of Merchants in the Records of the Grand Historian to prove the latter, drawing from Zigong. Indeed, Zigong played a role in allowing Confucius's way to be practiced in various countries. This shows the close relationship between economy and culture.

In short, Japanese people have their own central ideas in everything they do and learn. They never forget their own position and work hard. From this effort, they develop the spirit of establishing their country and dealing with the world. This is the strength of the Japanese nation and the weakness of the Chinese nation. Because the Chinese nation, although said to be the country where Confucianism originated, is fickle and lacks inner grasp. Nakayama Kyūshirō quoted Confucius, saying that if the Way is not practiced, he would take a raft and float out to sea. If he were to float to sea, the closest country would be Japan. Oh dear, is it really possible that Confucius's Way will go to Japan as he said? This is the shame of the Chinese! But how can the Chinese know shame? They still leave Confucius's teachings aside coldly. Those who don't understand the times want to advocate classics, and those who claim to understand the times often have never read the Four Books and Five Classics, and don't know what's going on. They learn the trends, pick up the scraps, and think that reading the classics is a corrupt and backward act. The Chinese claim to hold to the middle, but their thinking is always extreme, overcorrecting and not following the middle way, which is truly regrettable!

Nakayama Kyūshirō asks Chinese youth to accept the spirit of Confucianism. It is shameful to say that Chinese youth don't know what the Four Books and Five Classics are. Schools don't teach the classics, but the entrance exams for universities often have questions from the classics. We only know that teachers should "teach without discrimination," but unexpectedly, today's teachers are actually practicing "killing without teaching." Nothing is more ridiculous than this.

I read the Analects and the Four Books at the age of eight or nine, and the Spring and Autumn Annals and the Zuo Zhuan at the age of eleven or twelve. At that time, my older classmate also explained each chapter to me, and I had to review it every other day. But I didn't feel any benefit at all, only the difficulty. Later, when I went to school, I completed the so-called Five Classics as well. At that time, I had to read "Pullama" (probably referring to a foreign textbook) and learn arithmetic, mathematics, and algebra equations. It passed quickly, and I never had time to savor it. Later, after leaving school and entering the world, I experienced many things, and sometimes I used the Analects to relieve my feelings. Ah, it really surprised me why I didn't know its beauty before, but now I feel its meaning is profound. It truly fulfills Confucius' saying, "Reviewing the old and knowing the new." Why is it that he was born two thousand several hundred years ago and his words can still be applied to modern society? It shows that human academic thought has changed, but human nature and behavior still do not escape the original mold. I admire Confucius even more. How is it that in his short seventy-two or seventy-three years of age, what he said truly has the potential to be a "teacher for all ages"? His wisdom is truly unattainable. Zhao Pu used half of the Analects to govern the world. Not to mention half of it, if you can grasp a few words of the Analects, you can also benefit endlessly. This is not a compliment. Only those who have experienced this will know that my words are not wrong. Therefore, I advocate that every Chinese student should read a part of the Analects and select and read the Zuo Zhuan. Look, those who have outstanding achievements and contributions to the people are mostly those who are well-versed in the Zuo Zhuan!

According to various parties, confidence is still strong, and investment buyers are still active. The stock market price list is listed below.

### Mutual Observation, Bond Market Becomes Deadlocked

Yesterday, the unified government bond market was quiet, and the fluctuations became increasingly narrow. This is because the large bull investors are still absorbing at low prices, while the sellers are observing and not moving forward due to the small increase. Therefore, both sides are deadlocked, both expecting a new development. As a result, trading turned quiet, and each bond caused a spinning pattern. At the opening in the morning, buyers first appeared active. Then each bond, carrying the firm momentum of the previous day, rose slightly again. After the opening, due to retail investors selling off one after another, the needs declined. Thus, it recovered downward. As a result, A and B each fell by 20 cents, C and E were unchanged, and D and F were in the opening stage. The trading volume was surprisingly quiet, only about 780,000 yuan. The list is shown below.

### Price of Gold and Silver Jewelry Unchanged

Yesterday, the price of gold and silver jewelry in the Da Xin (大新) and Tong Hang (同行) jewelry stores in this city was still 2,150 yuan per tael at retail, with a reduction of about 300 yuan for purchases. The price among peers has stopped falling and tended to stabilize, due to a more active buying by a certain group. It was 1,875 yuan in the morning, the same as the previous day. Later, due to purchases by buyers, it rose to 1,890 yuan. Soon after, it dropped 10 yuan, to 1,880 yuan at noon, slightly higher than the previous day by 5 yuan, with a difference of only 15 yuan. The trading volume was sparse. As for silver jewelry, the price was still 16 yuan per tael, and the price among peers returned to 10 yuan and 89 cents.

### Military Tickets Firm and Stable

Yesterday, the foreign currency market saw Japanese military tickets firm and slightly stable. The price among peers was 5 yuan, 5 cents, and 5.67 li (釐). The price sold at silver shops and money exchange shops was above 5 yuan, 5 cents, and 6 fen (分), and the purchase price was 5 yuan, 5 cents, and 4.5 or 5 fen, it is said.

Yesterday, the discount rate of the Money Industry Association was 1.2 cents unchanged, and the newly drawn head and cash were cleared at the same price, it is said.

### Cotton Cloth Trading Is Very Limited

Factory cloth: Yesterday's market was stable as before. There were very few differences in the selling offers of various cloths, and some even slightly increased the prices, but the trading volume was extremely light. For example, 16-pound Earth Coarse Cloth was 180 yuan, the same pound Bumblebee was 178 yuan, Flying Swan was 177 yuan, 9-pound New Character was 109 yuan, 8-pound Zhenzhong was 107 yuan, 12-pound Earth Fine Cloth was 160 yuan, Fugui was 151 yuan, Dapeng was 150 yuan, and Fugui Fine Twill was 128 yuan. The trading volume was very limited. There was not much change in poplin drill and bleached cloth. 士林 (Shi Lin) cloth was more active. The selling price of Little Chick was 249 yuan, and Peach Girl opened at 258 yuan in the morning, rising to as high as 259.5 yuan, and the closing price in the afternoon was 258.5 yuan, slightly up by 25 cents.

East Cloth: Yesterday's market was still in a state of spinning and holding, but the situation was very firm. Four Gentlemen Drill opened at 7 yuan and 26 cents, rose to 7 yuan, 33 and 34 cents. Retail investors sold more and bought less, and then softened to 27 cents. However, it was firm and strong again at the afternoon close, at 7 yuan and 29 cents, up 3 cents. The afternoon closing price of 12-pound Dragon Head Fine Cloth was 176 yuan, a drop of 50 cents. However, Colorful Ball Flying Fish and mid-to-low-end fine cloth continued to rise by 50 cents to 75 cents per bolt. Colorful Ball reached a high of 164 yuan, and the afternoon closing price was 163.5 yuan, still with demand exceeding supply.

### All Kinds of Velvet Are Popular

Mohair, Sea White Dragon Velvet, Bear Hair Velvet, Sea Tiger Velvet, Rabbit Velvet, Lamb Velvet, Variegated Silk Velvet, Spiral Velvet, etc., have all been showing a strong trend recently. The market is strong, and the outlook is good. Incoming goods are even firmer, because the inventory in the industry is lacking, and people are optimistic. The autumn season is approaching, and sales are starting to move. Women's clothing makers have already been asking for samples. Also, because the inventory is low, and industry participants want to buy up anything cheap, the trading is active. The popularity of the market is the best in the recent velvet sector.

### Miscellaneous Grains in a Firm and Stable State

Beans: The transaction was sparse, and the price was flat. The market showed a stable trend. Yesterday, 10 bags of Tianjin Red Beans opened at a price of 165 yuan.

Also, if the orange cakes can be transferred to the warehouse this morning, they can also be opened at the same time, it is said.

### Sugar Stockpile Gradually Thinning

The sugar allocated to retailers for this month has now been completely sold out. The amount applied for September totaled more than 46,000 bags. The latest sugar stock totaled 244,000 bags, a decrease of more than 50,000 bags compared to the previous period. Coarse granulated white sugar is still the most abundant, followed by 20,000 bags of red sugar. The rest ranged from tens of thousands to several thousands of bags. Yesterday, the sugar stock market fluctuated slightly. The opening price for the coarse granulated sugar stock was 303 yuan, and the closing price was 302.5 yuan, down 50 cents. The red sugar stock rose instead, to 301.5 yuan, up about 4 yuan, due to the gradual shortage of goods. The total transaction volume was 1,300 bags.

### Hardware Transactions Quiet, Prices of Various Goods Stable

The hardware market has been very quiet recently. The transactions in various routes are light, and the business of the stores is also sparse. Although the prices of various goods are affected by the insufficient stock in Shanghai, it is difficult to raise them. The standard selling prices are all stable.

Bamboo Section Steel Bars: Since the decline in the construction industry in this city, the route for 40-foot cement copper bars has been severely hit. To this day, it is still difficult to see improvement. Retail sales in stores are also sluggish. Therefore, those holding the goods have difficulty raising their minds, and the market has been stable for a long time. For example, 4-point patterned bars open at 11,500 yuan per ton, and 5-point to 1-inch goods are around 11,000 yuan per ton.

Black Iron Billets: Recently, the intake of 2,000-pound black iron billets by printing factories, billet factories, machine factories, and mirror factories has all decreased. At the moment, only retail transactions in stores are still trading. Wholesale transactions are insignificant. At the moment, the market atmosphere is such that selling feels difficult, and buying is also not easy. Therefore, the market is in a difficult situation for both buyers and sellers. As a result, the transaction is even rarer, and the market atmosphere is bleak. Colleagues' bargaining is still 6,000 yuan per bundle.

### The Spirit of Confucius

— Wen

For thousands of years, the Way of Confucius has penetrated deeply into people's hearts. Based on the meaning of "reviewing the old and knowing the new," it is not a pedantic discussion to ponder and examine his teachings.

Confucius said: "My Way is one that runs through all." This consistent Way is called benevolence. Benevolence is the unified principle of morality. Confucius educated his disciples by focusing on moral practice. Only those who can establish themselves and others can be called gentlemen. The way of loyalty and forgiveness advocated by Confucius is also the morality of benevolence. Confucius valued trustworthiness: "Since ancient times, everyone has died, but a people cannot stand without trustworthiness." Trustworthiness is also a link in benevolence.

Confucius' autobiography: "At fifteen, I set my heart on learning; at thirty, I stood firm; at forty, I had no doubts; at fifty, I knew the mandate of Heaven; at sixty, my ear was attuned; at seventy, I followed my heart's desire, without transgressing the line." It can also be said that Confucius worked hard in his youth and did not transgress the line in his old age. His forty years of teaching life after the age of thirty, forgetting to eat and finding joy in forgetting worries, is a good encouragement for today's teachers.

The great spirit of Confucius will forever shine through the ages.

### The Child's Depressed Face

— Weiming

"Dad, it's time to pay tuition."

The child said to me softly with widened, gloomy eyes.

Yes, it was time to pay tuition, I knew this chain would be added to my body. But how can a parent not care about their children's education? I said to the child, "I know, Dad will think of something."

The child walked away. Watching his slow steps and drooping head, I thought he must be feeling just as uncomfortable as I was in that little heart of his.

I put on my wrinkled long gown and donned my broken straw hat. For the sake of my child's future, I had to make several risky attempts under the fierce sun!

However, the faces of my relatives and friends changed. Seeing me walking in with a face full of sorrow, their faces, which had been laughing and happy, also gradually became sorrowful.

"Brother, to be honest, I'm also thinking of a way myself."

They all "婉言拒絕" (politely refused), shaking their heads and sighing inexplicably, expressing a helpless look.

On the clean table were iced soda and ice cream, and a cool electric fan was blowing overhead. Perhaps their hearts were cold.

After several hours of running around, my long gown was soaked with sweat. I was angry, I was ashamed. Where could I go now?

Go home—no, don't go home, because I'm afraid to see the child's depressed face.

I lingered on the noisy street corner, lost, like a homeless wanderer!

In the hazy evening, the aroma of dinner was spread, making my mouth water and hunger burn. But I only bought a cup of cold tea from a roadside tea stall to moisten my throat at the cost of a penny.

It was night, and the stars twinkled in the sky. I quietly slipped into the house with my tired body.

The child was lying on the broken mat, he was already asleep. Looking at his thin, withered, and yellow face, I had an indescribable feeling of sadness.

I'm afraid, I'm afraid to see the child's depressed face again tomorrow!

### Self-Control

— Hailin

Self-control is the essence of happiness and success, and also the source of good morals and personality.

Self-control can help people use perseverance and solemnity to achieve success.

To have the abilities of self-love, self-examination, self-reflection, self-restraint, and self-respect is to be truly able to control oneself. Only those who can truly control themselves can obtain true freedom and joy.

Those who boast and deceive themselves will never succeed and will always live an unstable and unhappy life.

To strengthen our self-control, we must first do two things: one is to be careful of our conscience, and the other is to use a charitable spirit. Those who want to achieve greatness in any great career must have the ability to maintain self-control. They must have strict education and cultivation until they can steadily grasp self-control.

### A Small Note on Registration

— Chen Bi Yun

Early in the morning, I took my two children, Bao, who is eleven, and Qiang, who is ten, and walked along Yu Yuan Road. I didn't know where Lane 668 was, but I kept an eye on the house numbers on the north side of the road as we passed by.

Qiang was the first to spot Lane 668 and called out. So we walked into the gate of the lane. The lane was very wide, and the ground was paved with asphalt, which was very flat.

After walking to the end of the asphalt road, guided by Bao, who had been there before, we turned left and entered another gate, stepping onto an equally wide gravel road. On this gate, behind a poplar tree, I saw the three characters "Tong An Village."

We walked only a few dozen steps along the gravel road and arrived at the entrance of Tong An Village. Looking inside, the school sign of "Ji Ying Elementary and Middle School" was hung high in front.

I felt that the location was indeed quiet and secluded.

We entered the lane and walked towards the school. Through the gate with another school sign hanging directly above it, we entered the campus. The grounds were quite large and could be used as a sports field. The lush green grass did not yet feel any hint of autumn.

On the north side of the lawn, there was a row of three-bay, three-story buildings. I seemed to see some hall of some university. Such spacious school buildings are indeed rare in today's world where "lane schools" are prevalent.

As soon as we entered the middle gate, someone came to greet us, asking us amiably if we were there to register. She was a middle-aged lady.

Invited by her, I sat down and answered her with "yes," and explained that I had seen the advertisements and news in the newspaper and admired the name of "Ji Ying," so I had made a special trip with my children. Bao intended to enter the first year of middle school, Qiang the sixth grade of elementary school, and my four-and-a-half-year-old daughter, Ai, intended to enter kindergarten.

I asked her if she was Principal Fang Peiying. She acknowledged it. She also introduced Ms. Shi Jimi, who was helping her with the registration procedures and writing for various well-known magazines.

While completing the registration procedures, we talked a lot. One thing worth noting is that the principal said that she wanted to run a school, not a "school shop." She had no money, let alone any subsidies. All expenses were entirely pieced together by her, borrowed from various friendly parties. Therefore, her teachers did not come to apply for a job to earn a salary, but came voluntarily because of shared aspirations. In the end, she said, please watch, she must run a school that better suits the ideals of most knowledgeable people, and she is willing to be supervised and guided by these people.

After completing the registration, Principal Fang enthusiastically led us to visit the classrooms upstairs and downstairs. The brightness and spaciousness of each classroom, of course, need not be mentioned, and the west side of the school building was a large garden, shaded by trees. Far ahead, there were taller houses, nestled among the tall trees, which also gave people a sense of beauty.

On the way home, I watched Bao and Qiang jumping and skipping, and took a deep breath. The matter of choosing a school for my children was really troublesome enough. From now on, I can avoid this trouble.

I believe Principal Fang's words are true, and I will be watching.

### Same Boat

— Chao Xu

The world is dark, the earth is shaking;

The sea is vast, the road is long;

The wind is howling, the waves are surging;

The life in this small boat,

Even a strong man feels distressed.

…… ……

Comrades! Listen, look!

The big ship in front suddenly capsizes;

Friends! Listen, gaze!

The steamship behind also suddenly sinks.

…… ……

But you don't need to be sad, don't need to shout;

Don't panic, don't be dispirited;

With our skillful hands,

Calm minds;

Together, we shake out this gloomy atmosphere,

That treacherous waterway;

Aiming at our goal,

Strive to row forward!

### Words from the Bible

— Yi Min

Judge not, that ye be not judged. For with what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged: and with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you again.

——Matthew

But let your communication be, Yea, yea; Nay, nay:

——Matthew

Understanding is a wellspring of life unto him that hath it: but the instruction of fools is folly.

——Proverbs

The getting of treasures by a lying tongue is a vanity tossed to and fro of them that seek death.

——Proverbs

### In the Same Boat Through Storms

— Xiang Jia Zhi

(8) What Can Be Done

The news that He Zi brought was largely the same as the news that A Yu brought. The difference, so to speak, was that Fei Changhe himself, along with his wife and daughter, were all at Wei Yunqing's house. Only Bian Cuizhen was not at the Wei's house. She was said to be somewhere near Shanghai, or even farther away. Wei Cheng was originally full of anger, but hearing He Zi Xing say this, his face turned even redder. Madam Ye Er asked He Zi Xing, "Where did you hear these things?" He Zi Xing said, "When I arrived at Hua Gang, I sat down at a teahouse and ordered a pot of tea. I told people about the theft at our house. Two or three people were somewhat acquainted with Fei Changhe and said that Fei Changhe had been losing so badly these past few days that he had even pawned the felt hat on his head." Madam Ye Er said, "Don't beat around the bush. Who said that Miss Cuizhen had gone to Shanghai?" He Zi Xing said, "It was also said by a tea guest. I don't know him. He said that in this village, for hundreds of years, stealing women only happened when abducting brides. This isn't an abduction of a bride, so it must be either rape or sale. Fei Changhe has always been ruthless. If he didn't steal her to rape or sell, what else would he steal her for?" Madam Ye Er scolded, "Teahouses are places of rumor. Who is willing to take responsibility for what they say? Can you listen to these people's words? I didn't expect you to be even worse than A Xing, listening to people spout such nonsense and bringing rumors to deceive the young master, making everyone worried to no end."

He Zi Xing was speechless, rebuked by the mistress. His face flushed red, and he lowered his head, hiding behind A Xing. Wei Cheng saw that He Zi Xing had already been scolded by Madam Ye Er and dared not make a sound. It was inconvenient for him to get angry, so he followed Madam Ye Er into the house and said, "Aunt, what is said in teahouses and taverns is indeed not entirely believable, but it is still a clue. We should follow this clue and investigate." Madam Ye Er said, "Wei Cheng, don't rush. I have already made up my mind. I will go to Wei Yunqing's house and ask Wei Yunqing face to face. I will leave immediately. Who will row the boat?" At that time, A Xing, He Zi Xing, and Xu Jin Fu were all outside the door. They all replied in unison: "I will go!" Madam Ye Er said, "It should still be A Xing. I will go to the room to change clothes. A Xing, bring the boat to the front water bridge." (166)

### Hope

— Bai Yu

There is no effort without hope.

Emerson

Hope is like the sun, which, as we journey toward it, casts the shadow of our burden behind us.

Smiles

Dispersion is not shameful; losing hope is truly shameful.

Lincoln

You can have a hundred failures, but never abandon your hope.

German Proverb
