Eisenhower also warned French warships not to move, the garrison of coastal batteries not to fire, and air force pilots to keep their aircraft on the ground. Vichy announced that General Darlan, Commander-in-Chief of the French Army, Navy, and Air Force, is currently in the port of Algiers and has joined General Juin, Commander-in-Chief of the French forces in North Africa, to be responsible for defending the colonies. The Vichy Wireless Radio Station broadcast the official announcement issued by the government regarding the American invasion, urging all French people to "refrain from being swayed by any foreign broadcasts," and stated that the government will inform all French people of all developments. France is deeply concerned and must unite and remain calm to deal with this situation. France will cope with this situation, and the nation that created this situation, for which French people once shed blood, must be dealt with for the sake of honor. (Continued on page 3)

### Vichy Officially Confirms War is Expanding

Havas News Agency Report from Vichy, Eighth: Officials here have recently confirmed that Anglo-American allied forces have landed in Safi, French Morocco, and are currently engaged in fierce fighting. Several other Allied units have landed in the port of Mehdia. Attacks by enemy naval and air forces on the port of Casablanca have been repelled. In addition, American aircraft bombed the Rabat airport again.

Havas News Agency Report from Vichy, Eighth: Regarding the Anglo-American Allied forces' attack on French North Africa, it has been learned that Anglo-American Allied forces have landed successively in the ports of Algiers, Oran, and other places. The situation in various places is recorded as follows: (1) Algiers: American troops landed at 7:30 this morning under the cover of British warships, attempting to occupy the Naval Building and the port. Repeated attacks have been repelled by the defending forces, but those attacking in other locations have gained a foothold. The situation is serious, and the British and Americans are preparing for a large-scale landing. (2) Oran: Anglo-American Allied forces have also attacked. Two old British medium cruisers have been sunk by the defending forces. Many soldiers have been captured on the east and west sides of the port. It is reported that a part of Arzew has been occupied by the Allied forces, and the situation seems extremely chaotic. West of Oran, the Allied forces landed near Segalo and have occupied Bousfer. French forces are launching a counterattack from Oran. (3) Tunisia is calm as usual, but its airfield has also been bombed. (4) Morocco: Allied forces landed in the port of Safi. Fedhala and Mehdia have also been attacked by the Allied forces.

Havas News Agency Report from Algiers, Eighth: Five American aircraft bombed the Naval Building here at 11:00 AM today without encountering strong anti-aircraft fire. However, one American aircraft was shot down. A batch of American troops landed from destroyers and attacked the Naval Building, but all were captured by the defending forces. After the troops landed, this destroyer sailed out of the port but was damaged by a French battleship and may have sunk. Telephone communication here was interrupted once at 3:35 AM today, but it returned to normal by 9:00 AM. The post office, telephone company, and radio station here were destroyed by the Tegall faction at night, but they soon resumed work. The radio station was once occupied by the Tegall faction. General Tegall also announced that he had led the African troops to fight on the American side, but he was soon purged by the defending forces. In addition, a French submarine sailed out of this port and was attacked by American aircraft but was not hit. Another warship has also safely left the port.

### Roosevelt Issues Declaration; Pétain Sends Telegram of Rebuttal

Havas News Agency Report from the Swiss Capital, Eighth: Regarding the American troops landing in French North Africa, according to press reports, the American General Staff issued a communiqué today stating, "Last night, American troops, under the cover of the British Navy and Air Force, began landing at several locations on the coast of French North Africa. These American troops are under the command of General Eisenhower and are equipped with all the armaments necessary for modern warfare. Several British divisions will be sent to reinforce them." Later, the Presidential Palace announced that the United States had to land in French North Africa to prevent the enemy from invading French North Africa. The Axis powers' invasion of French North Africa would constitute a direct threat to the Americas because French West Africa is only separated from Brazil by a body of water. (Translator's note: less than 2,000 miles) Therefore, this action by our country is tantamount to opening a second battlefield to assist our bravely fighting Soviet allies. Mr. Oerleigh, the secretary of President Roosevelt, also told the press that "the American troops landing in French North Africa is enough to constitute the beginning of the current war entering the offensive stage." In addition, American shortwave radio stations broadcast this morning President Roosevelt's letter to the French people and printed this document into leaflets, which were flown by British and American aircraft to be distributed over French North Africa.

Havas News Agency Report from Vichy, Eighth: Regarding the Anglo-American Allied forces landing in the port of Algiers in French North Africa this morning, President Roosevelt of the United States sent a telegram to Marshal Pétain, explaining the reason why the United States took this action. Marshal Pétain immediately sent a telegram to refute it. The text stated, "Last night, upon hearing the news that your country's troops invaded French North Africa, I was deeply concerned and indignant. Regarding the telegram, what Your Excellency cited as an excuse cannot be considered justified and only benefits your enemies. Even if they have such intentions, they have never put them into action. I have often said that if my empire is invaded, it should, regardless of who the aggressor is, rise up in self-defense. I believe Your Excellency also knows this. Your Excellency should know that I can fulfill my promise. When, unfortunately, it was necessary to request an armistice, I preserved the empire. Your Excellency, in the position of a national leader, maintaining good relations with us is something worth commemorating, but at this moment, taking such a cruel action is really difficult to understand. Therefore, I ordered the whole country, 'France, is now at a critical juncture. We are attacked and should rise up in self-defense.'"

Alliance News Agency Report from Lisbon, Eighth: According to a Washington dispatch, White House Secretary Oerleigh met with a group of reporters at the White House at noon on the 7th and said that the expeditionary force is a beautiful army with American equipment. With the assistance of the British Navy and Air Force, it has landed successfully in several places. Oerleigh added that if German troops occupied West Africa, using it as a base, the east coast of the Americas would be in danger of being attacked across the narrow waters of the Atlantic Ocean. The British and Americans took this precautionary measure to prevent this direct threat. The British fleet also used this as an excuse to unexpectedly attack the French fleet in the waters off the Netherlands. Oerleigh also stated that this is an action to echo the British forces on the Nile front. Regarding the landing site, the US government announced on the 8th that the American expeditionary force successfully landed at two locations on the Mediterranean coast of French North Africa on the night of the 7th under the cover of the British Navy and Air Force. From this, it can be seen that the American troops' landing sites should be Algeria facing the Mediterranean Sea and the coast of Morocco facing the Atlantic Ocean. General Eisenhower, the commander of the expeditionary force, is also in Morocco. However, the strength of the expeditionary force has not been reported in detail, but Oerleigh specifically stated at a meeting with reporters that this landing should not be considered a second front.

### Britain Provides Guarantee; Respects Spanish and Portuguese Interests

Havas News Agency Report from London, Eighth: It was officially announced that the British ambassador to Spain, Hoare, provided assurances to the Spanish government today that the Anglo-American Allied forces' attack on French North Africa will not jeopardize Spain's interests in North Africa or the temporary status of the port of Tangier.

Havas News Agency Report from London, Eighth: It was officially announced that the British government has notified the Portuguese government, providing assurances that it will not take any action against Portugal and its colonies.

### Recent Developments in Europe; Japanese Observations

Alliance News Agency Report from Tokyo, Eighth: Observers here expect that after the United States invades French North African colonies, France will break with the Allied powers and use its powerful navy to participate in the war against the Allied powers. It is said that this new development is due to the increased threat of Axis submarines in the Atlantic Ocean, so the United States must establish a base in this area to protect the transport lines. Other factors that contributed to the American troops landing in French North Africa are: (1) failure to open a second front in Europe; (2) plan to invade Libya from Equatorial Africa to attack the Axis forces in the back; (3) to show benefits to Argentina and Chile in order to arouse anti-Axis elements in Chile. The temporary parliament of the Chilean Congress will soon convene. Regarding the American troops landing, there is no detailed report available except for the official announcement from Washington. However, observers said that the American commander will have to work hard to deploy sufficient troops to protect the long line from the Mediterranean in the north to Cape Town in the south to prevent Axis submarine operations. Furthermore, the United States has expanded its supply lines as far as Iraq, so the American rear transportation lines will inevitably be attacked by Axis submarines. The British and American invasion of French territory this time is another deliberate violation of international law, and the French will suffer greatly. France has suffered in several incidents, such as the Battle of Mers-el-Kébir and the invasion of Syria and Madagascar.

### Egyptian Front; Fighting is in Full Swing; Axis Opens New Positions; Adds Reinforcements; Fierce Fighting in the Marsa Matruh Area

Havas News Agency Report from Rome, Seventh: Responsible military personnel here said that on the Egyptian front on the 31st of last month, there was a period of calm for several hours. Afterwards, fierce fighting broke out suddenly and intensified. The British and Americans transferred elite troops to the front line to fight, sparing no human and material sacrifices. By the 4th of this month, the intensity of the fighting had reached its peak. The German and Italian command ordered the front-line troops to retreat to a new line of defense between Fuka and Marsa Matruh. In short, the North African war is still in its early stages, and fierce fighting is just beginning.

Havas News Agency Report from Berlin, Eighth: According to an official announcement, the enemy is continuing to launch large-scale attacks on the Egyptian front, Marsa Matruh, under the cover of large armored vehicle formations.

Alliance News Agency Report from Bern, Eighth: According to the German High Command's announcement last night, German and Italian troops are engaged in fierce fighting with British troops on a sixty-mile-long front from north to south between Fuka and Marsa Matruh. British transportation lines have been cut off by the Axis forces. Many British tanks and soldiers have been captured. Daba, an air force base occupied by the British, was completely destroyed by the German army, and coal and vehicles were taken away. A report from Cairo also said that when the Allied forces arrived in Daba, they saw that the station buildings, thirteen trains, and many transport vehicles loaded with ammunition had been completely destroyed. At the same time, the British army continued to pursue the German and Italian main forces that were retreating in an orderly manner. It is said that the British army is advancing south towards Marsa Matruh, trying to encircle the Axis forces. The British military is quite concerned about the German army's retreat in this way and admits that the British Eighth Army is feeling difficulty in obtaining resources. General Rommel is retreating quickly to join his reinforcements. The British military is deeply concerned that the German army will be able to continue to resist.

Havas News Agency Report from Berlin, Seventh: Semi-official German sources stated that the defensive strategy adopted by General Rommel on the Egyptian front has been successful. As a result, the British army has lost its initiative. Yesterday, the British army failed to take any major action. Only one enemy infantry unit, under the cover of tanks, attacked the German and Italian rearguard covering the retreat, but it was eventually repelled by the Allied forces. In addition, Axis reconnaissance units attacked the British army from the flanks and rear, annihilating several British units. The remaining enemies were forced to retreat, leaving behind a large number of equipment. At present, an important factor in the war situation is that the tanks of the Axis Command have not yet been transferred to the front line for combat. The German and Italian Allied forces' strategic retreat is carried out according to a predetermined plan and in an orderly manner. When its main forces retreat, they will be covered by the rearguard and special security forces organized by tank and heavy artillery units. As for the Axis forces' overall operational plan, it is still unknown at this time. It is only known that a large number of Axis troops have been transferred to designated positions. At the same time, new-style tanks and heavy artillery units are also being transferred to the new positions to reinforce them. Yesterday, the British Air Force was inactive, whether in the daytime or at night, so the Axis forces' movements did not encounter any obstacles. At present, the Axis forces are heading to the Qattara Depression. Its northern route is fighting bravely, defending the desert battlefield, and will never easily give up an inch of territory, and is adopting a "flexible strategy" to gradually move towards new positions. In short, due to the lack of roads and the rugged terrain, both the attacking and defending sides on the Egyptian front are suffering significant losses. However, on the northern route, the German and Italian Allied forces' continuous attacks on the British armored vehicle formations have forced the enemy to abandon some offensive strongholds, which is quite important.

### Genoa, Italy, Bombed Again

Havas News Agency Report from London, Seventh: It was officially announced here that last night, British bomber groups again attacked the port of Genoa in southern Italy. Afterwards, two bomber aircraft were lost.

Havas News Agency Report from London, Eighth: It was officially announced that British bombers bombed the port of Genoa, Italy again last night. Afterwards, four of our aircraft failed to return.

Havas News Agency Report from the Swiss Capital, Seventh: At 8:15 PM today, an air raid alert was issued here once, and it was lifted at 9:25 PM. Then, at 10:42 PM, a second air raid alert was issued. Seito News Agency Report from the Vatican, Eighth: Well-informed sources here declared last night that Pope Pius XII was extremely shocked to learn that British aircraft bombed Genoa and expressed concern for the losses suffered by the local people and churches.

### Fierce North Wind on the Eastern Front; German Offensive Slows; Soviets Launch Counterattack in the Terek Area

Havas News Agency Report from the Swedish Capital, Eighth: Military observers here recently said that the weather has been bad recently on the northern and central routes of the Eastern Front, with fierce cold winds. There has been continuous heavy rain in the Caucasus, and the roads are muddy. In addition, the Red Army is resisting bravely in various war zones, which has greatly slowed the German army's attack on Stalingrad. At the same time, the advance towards the Utes of Nikitz, Tupus, and Grozny is also extremely slow. The most noteworthy event on the Eastern Front today is that the Red Army launched a large-scale counterattack under the cover of tanks in the upper reaches of the Terek River. The purpose of this is to attack General List's mechanized units and prevent them from advancing towards the city of Ordzhonikidze. However, the fighting is still in progress there, and the outcome is still unknown.

Havas News Agency Report from an area near the Soviet border, Seventh: The German army on the Eastern Front is currently advancing towards the oil-producing areas of Ordzhonikidze and Grozny in the central Caucasus, so military observers in general are paying attention to the development of the fighting in the Terek River area. Although the Soviet army is making every effort to resist, the German-Italian Allied forces are continuing to make progress and have reached the city of Alton River last night. This river is the last natural barrier to the city of Ordzhonikidze. Although the Soviet army bombarded the Axis positions with artillery, the German army still broke through the Soviet defense line. According to unconfirmed news, German reconnaissance teams reached the suburbs of Ordzhonikidze last night. On the southern route of the city, the German army continued to advance after cutting off the highway to Georgia. The vanguard is now very close to the city of Lars. However, on the northern route of the city, that is, the Beslan area, the German army encountered resolute resistance from the Soviet army and is currently holding the railway line along the Qian position occupied on the 5th of this month, engaged in reorganizing its troops. In addition, the Soviet army is attempting to flank the German army in the Terek River valley from the south of Malgobek. On the Stalingrad front, there are currently only localized battles. On the Tupus front, the German mountain troops are still advancing. In the Gal Engk wasteland, the Soviet army launched an attack on the German army, intending to recapture the Yerkin Heights. Some observers originally thought that the Red Army would launch a counterattack on the occasion of the 25th anniversary of the Soviet Revolution, but it did not materialize. It is only known that according to a report received by the German High Command, new Soviet reinforcements have recently arrived on the front line to deploy, which shows that General Timoshenko has not completely abandoned the plan for a joint counterattack.

Alliance News Agency Report from Moscow, Eighth: On the morning of the 7th, the 25th anniversary of the Soviet Revolution, Stalin issued an order to the Soviet army to encourage them to be loyal, complete the anti-German war, and promulgated three key points for mutual compliance: (1) The Soviet army must firmly defend its current line of defense and stop the German army from advancing; (2) The Soviet army must strictly obey orders to strengthen the unity of the command system; (3) Strengthen guerrilla warfare in various places in the German rear.

### German National Socialist Party Uprising Anniversary

Berlin, 8th (Haitong News Agency) - Germany is celebrating the anniversary of the National Socialist Party uprising today and tomorrow. German newspapers are reviewing the plans of National Socialism and Fascism and their differences from Bolshevism and Capitalism. Stalin aims to destroy Germany, and Germany is determined to eliminate the institutions of Bolshevism. However, Stalin has no intention of allowing Capitalism to triumph. The friction among the so-called "allied" nations is intensifying, it is said.

### Britain Stockpiles Armaments in Gibraltar

Stockholm, 7th (Havas News Agency) - A dispatch from a correspondent in Madrid, recently published in the Tổng Huì Bào, states that in recent weeks, Britain has been stockpiling a large quantity of armaments in the port of Gibraltar. British engineers are excavating a giant cave in the rock to store tanks, bombers, and fighter planes. Therefore, general observers believe that Britain may intend to open a second battlefield in Europe, using the port of Gibraltar as a base of operations, it is said.

### Germany Strengthens Defenses Along Western European Coast

Berlin, 8th (Haitong News Agency) - The line of fortresses built by the German army on the French coast has now been extended to the Norwegian coast. Elite German troops are guarding the coasts of France, Denmark, Norway, and other countries. Coastal vessels are constantly patrolling to prevent enemy warships and aircraft from invading, and to protect German supply ships, guiding German ships through minefields. German minesweepers are clearing mines dropped by enemy aircraft in the shipping lanes day and night. In Norway, the German army is strengthening existing fortresses and building new fortresses and submarine bases, it is said.

### Africa Amidst Shifting Winds: The Independent Black Liberia Founded by Eighty Black Slaves (Part 3)

After this sorrowful declaration was issued, in the following year (1848), it moved Britain, France, and other great powers, all of which formally recognized Liberia as a formal nation. However, the United States only belatedly accepted it fourteen years later.

The first president, of course, was the meritorious Robert's, who was elected and honored to serve. He served two terms as president, one for four years and one for eight years.

A small country like Liberia, probably only the size of three Hainan Islands—45,000 square miles—with a population of only 1.5 million, including foreigners, why has it suddenly become important in this war?

This leads us to offer two reasons: (1) due to its unique terrain and fertile soil; (2) because of its position in Africa, it has special importance in the Allied war plan. Let's talk about the first point now, and the second point must be reserved for later explanation.

Liberia is located below French Guinea in West Africa, within ten degrees of the equator, and can be said to be a formal tropical country. The coastline is very straight, about 350 miles long. Because it is very straight, it is indeed not easy to build good harbors. But there are also considerable advantages, because the terrain is very high, with an average height of about 1,500 feet: therefore, along the coast, it is probably impossible to land by force. In addition, at the southernmost point, there is a cape called Cape Palmas. The terrain here suddenly turns eastward, almost forming a 90-degree turn, and in front of it is the famous Gulf of Guinea. Military experts say that this point alone has great military value. As for what value it has, and how high this value is, we non-military experts certainly cannot figure it out for the time being.

Not only is this point special, but the coast is covered with jagged rocks, pointing to the sky like a mountain of knives; although there are not many beaches in the sea, there are reefs scattered everywhere, and if you are not careful, you will run aground; running aground is not the same as hitting a mine. This point probably also has some military value.

In terms of terrain, Liberia is a deformed structure: the country has a total of six large rivers running across it, four of which are larger and three are smaller; two of the larger ones, the Mano and the Cavalla, surround the country like a moat. In addition, except for the coastal mountains, almost the entire country is forest. The largest forest is called Gola, with a total of 6,000 square miles. The second largest is the NiDi forest, all of which are rubber trees.

In 1926, the British female explorer Miss Mill, after visiting the entire country of Liberia, said a few words. She said, "Regarding natural resources, Liberia can be said to have an inexhaustible treasure trove; the annual rainfall is average and regular, and the soil is fertile, producing almost everything—as long as you sow, you will definitely reap a harvest; as for minerals, although they have not yet been mined (this was a report from sixteen years ago), experts estimate that they are extremely rich. In terms of forests, it can be said that gold is everywhere—either extremely useful rubber or large pine trees for building materials."

### After Signing for 500 Tons of Cooking Oil, Arrangements Have Been Made for Transport

Likely to Be Available on the Market Next Week

Since the cooking oil wholesalers in this city signed an order for 500 tons (10,000 piculs) with the military distribution office, they have been actively making arrangements for transportation. Old oil barrels have already been collected and are now being processed for shipment. It is expected that the oil will be available on the market within the next week, so the panic about cooking oil will be eliminated. According to the person in charge of the cooking oil wholesalers, who told a reporter from the Datong News Agency, the amount of 20,000 piculs of cooking oil supplied by the military distribution group each month is far from sufficient. Due to the peak sales in winter, they plan to request an increase to facilitate distribution. At the same time, they hope that citizens will not buy and hoard too much, which will hinder the people's food supply. The retail price of cooking oil has not changed, with raw oil at 1.295 military yuan per catty and soybean oil at 1.245 military yuan per catty. If anyone sells at a high price, they can be reported and will be severely punished. The office aims to operate fairly. The recent punishment of 360 oil merchants can serve as a warning. It is also learned that the amount of oil allocated to each large and small oil store in the future will be divided into four levels: 50 catties, 30 catties, 20 catties, and 10 catties per day, but this is still under consideration.

### Blackout Drills to Be Held at Any Time

Scheduled Air Raids Not Confirmed

Recently, there have been many rumors and disagreements regarding the re-enactment of blackout drills. It has been found that air defense exercises may be held within the month, but the date is not specified in advance. The air defense headquarters may issue an alert and hold an exercise at any time. The rumors circulating outside are all unfounded. Citizens should be prepared at all times, and upon hearing the alarm, they should pay attention to shielding lights. If any deficiencies are found in the air defense facilities, they will be severely punished by the authorities. Therefore, it is hoped that citizens will not be negligent. The joint security districts in the French Concession have recently been stepping up their efforts to practice air defense blackout drills. Firefighting, cleanup, and rescue teams are also being strengthened to be ready to respond at any time, so the atmosphere is quite tense. It is also learned that the Air Defense Committee of the French Concession has initiated a special air defense donation to raise funds for air defense in the concession. Starting from the previous day, the head of each district's Baojia is collecting donations from each household. According to those responsible for this fundraising, this special donation is completely voluntary by the citizens, and the authorities will never force it.

### Li Liansheng Murder Case Prosecuted by Police

Li Liansheng, a detective in the gambling squad of the former French police, nicknamed "Pockmarked Li Liansheng," was murdered by his wife, Jiang Wenzhen, in collusion with her lover, Qian Guanhua, and her younger brother, Jiang Boming, who in turn hired four assassins with the surname Jiang, including Zhang Hankai and Zhang Afu, to hack him to death with axes on the morning of April 22nd of the 28th year of the Republic [1939]. Three and a half years have passed since then. Recently, Jiang Boming, out of resentment for failing to borrow money from his sister, informed the police, which led to the cracking of the case. All of the above-mentioned people were arrested for interrogation. However, the actual murderers are still at large and are being pursued by the police for legal action. The circumstances have been reported in the newspapers. Now that the police have concluded their investigation of Jiang Wenzhen and others, they were sent to court yesterday and charged with premeditated incitement to murder and other crimes. During the interrogation of the defendants, their confessions contradicted each other. The court ordered a postponement for further investigation and clarification before further interrogation. The defendants were returned to custody separately.

### Planning Textile Exports: Preparing to Form a Cotton Purchasing Company

Intending to Transport All Idle Spindles from Japan to Shanghai

Chinese yarn mill owners and cotton merchants in this city are jointly preparing to organize a cotton purchasing company to procure raw cotton in various cotton-producing areas. According to messages from various cotton-producing areas, this year's cotton production is quite sufficient. It is reported that the relevant authorities have approved the company's application for paper weaving, but there are still a few minor difficulties to be resolved before the company can be formally established. The company will then purchase cotton from the Shanghai area, Pudong, Nantong, Taicang, Nanjing, and Ningbo and arrange for its transport to Shanghai to be distributed to various yarn mills in this city by the Japanese military authorities. According to qualified sources, due to the shortage of raw cotton in Shanghai, 60% to 80% of the spindles in the city's yarn mills have been shut down. The activities of the cotton purchasing company should alleviate the cotton shortage in Shanghai. In addition to the existing machinery, the authorities also plan to transport all idle spindles from Japan to increase the output of the city's yarn mills, because the raw cotton currently used is still the yarn mills' existing stock. Planning for textile exports is the main reason for this plan.

Chairman Sasai's Opening Declaration

It has been eleven months since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War. The solid unity of the Great Japanese Empire and the friendly nations of Greater East Asia has enabled us to cooperate wholeheartedly to thoroughly defeat the enemy of England and the United States and the Chongqing regime, which deviates from East Asia. Now, our illustrious battle results have completely eliminated the Anglo-American aggressive forces that have poisoned East Asia. The nations of Greater East Asia have thus been liberated and are becoming increasingly prosperous. We hope for the speedy establishment of the Co-Prosperity Sphere, and everyone will work hard towards the future of great construction. The establishment of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere is based on the harmonious cooperation of the various nations within the sphere. Secondly, its construction is to be completed with economy, ideology, and culture. The so-called harmonious cooperation is the combination of the spirit of national strong countries, sincerity, mutual trust, and mutual assistance, and then it can be realized. This Greater East Asia Friendship Sports Meet, which is jointly participated in by athletes from various countries in Greater East Asia and representatives of the allied nations of Germany and Italy, expresses the effect of our national affinity with a lively and healthy spirit. At the same time, the will and strength of our various nations must be proclaimed to the world. The athletes participating in this conference understand the true meaning of this conference, which shows the vigorous and healthy spirit of all of you, and entrust it to the disciplined technology obtained from the usual training, and play the initial purpose of this conference, which is what we are eagerly expecting. I now declare the meeting open.

President Yada's Opening Speech

On this day of the birth of a new world, and on the eleventh anniversary of the issuance of the imperial edict by His Majesty the Emperor on November 8, the 30th year of the Republic of China, with the great assistance and cooperation of the allied countries of Germany and Italy, who have understanding and sympathy for the construction of the great cause of Greater East Asia, I am deeply grateful to be able to participate in this historic sports conference with the nations of East Asia. I would like to extend my congratulations to you all. The era of talking about abstract words and grand theories has passed. The facts that are currently before us are increasingly pressing and powerfully existent. Therefore, even if we sing adjectives or sentimental arguments, I am afraid that it will not have the slightest impact on this fact, which is as tight as a great chime stone. We must rise up, from thinking to awakening, and we want to study and discuss everything in the center, and above all, we must not lack resolute rise. The rise should start from the nearest and most unquestionable place and put it into practice. However, to start building the great cause of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, promote the self-awareness and liberation of the Asian nations, and the province must also start from strong unity. However, the so-called unity of the nations is also for various nations that are different in terms of race, history, and culture. To seek the combination of the nations, the first key point is to first establish mutual understanding and trust among the nations, because "unreasonable bushels cannot produce friendship, and without trust, there can be no unity." If the construction based on this kind of understanding and trust can be firmly completed, then any huge building can be built on it, even the great monastery of the skyscraper can be successfully built. If the construction is started without the completion of mutual understanding and trust, it will be a castle in the sand, and it will inevitably collapse after the storm. The purpose of today's sports conference is to lay a cornerstone in this kind of basic project. I am deeply fortunate to have the sympathy and support of all, and the grand occasion is unprecedented since the opening of the port, which is enough to show the smooth progress of the realization of our ideals. I share the great pleasure and satisfaction with you. At present, the Anglo-American aggressive forces in Shanghai have been completely eliminated. This conference can express the first step in the unity of the nations of Greater East Asia. I congratulate you on the prosperity and happiness of Greater East Asia. Finally, I would like to express my deepest gratitude to the nations of the allied countries of Switzerland and Italy.

Chen Gongbo's Congratulatory Speech

Congratulatory speech to the Greater East Asia Friendship Sports Association: Great is East Asia, laying a solid foundation. This grand meeting is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. The health of the nation, sports promoting light, broad arena competitions, and handsome talents gather. Friendship and love, meeting with sincerity, mutual assistance and mutual tolerance, coexistence and co-prosperity. In the voice of peace, our martial spirit is promoted. The construction of East Asia is advancing day by day. Chen Gongbo.

Reply from the Japanese Middle School Representative

Today, amidst the continuous victories in the Greater East Asia War, the eleventh anniversary of the Great Edict is commemorated, and the Greater East Asia Friendship Sports Meet also happens to be held today. The athletes from our Greater East Asia nations and the allied nations of Germany and Italy, a total of 20,000 strong, are publicly participating and demonstrating the disciplined standards they have obtained from their usual training. The expression of the spirit of friendship among the people of the Greater East Asia nations and the allied nations is an honor shared by all of us. Today, we are deeply grateful to the Chairman of the Conference and the representatives of the guests for their gracious presence, warm participation, and encouragement. We vow to maintain a solemn attitude, grasp the victory of the Greater East Asia War, and move forward. The morale and physical strength of the Greater East Asia nations and the allied nations must be promoted at home and abroad. At the same time, we will use the strength of harmonious cooperation and unity to live up to the expectations of this Friendship Sports Meet.

Mr. Yuan Ludeng's Closing Speech

Dear athletes and spectators, the great spirit expressed at this conference is a model for promoting the solemn regulations and strong will of the people of Greater East Asia. At the same time, it has achieved the effect of harmonious cooperation. We have now begun to step into the realm of national affinity, which is worthy of heartfelt celebration. At the same time, the well-organized order and the spirit of solid unity demonstrated at this conference today are truly inspiring. We vow to move forward with the construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. Finally, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to the members who have worked hard to assist this conference. I now declare the meeting closed.

Chairman Sasai's Closing Declaration

Thank you all for coming here to participate in this conference. I am very grateful that you all have a strong physique and a spirit of harmonious cooperation, which can truly achieve the purpose expected by this conference. I am convinced that it will definitely enable the nations of Greater East Asia and the European allied nations to be friendly to each other and become a model spirit of increasing unity. Therefore, I express my utmost respect and briefly express a few words. I now declare the meeting closed.

### Analysis of the Trend of Department Store Stocks

—On the Trend of Chinese Stocks, Part Three—

Last week, the rising trend of new pharmaceutical stocks on the Chinese stock market did not subside, and the aftermath of cultural stocks was amazing. Department store stocks, which have been relatively stable in recent months, also began their upward trend last week.

The main department store stocks in circulation include Wing On, Sincere, New World, The Sun, Lane Crawford, China National Products, China Underwear, and China Department Store. Among them, Wing On, New World, China National Products, and China Underwear are more actively traded. According to the China Economic Research Institute's survey and statistics of the sixteen major Chinese stock indexes. . . Taking June of this year as 100%, the total index of the sixteen stocks last week was 161.1%, and the four department store stocks rose by 3.4% to 44.4%. If the previous week was taken as 100%, the total index of the sixteen stocks last week was 109.2%, and the four department store stocks rose by 4.5% to 12.8%, as shown in the following table:

June as 100% Last Week's Index Previous Week as 100% Last Week's Index

Wing On 144.4 12.7

New World 140.6 105.3

National Products 116.5 13.8

Underwear 103.4 104.5

Total Index 161.1 109.2

Wing On Company currently has a capital of 20 million yuan, divided into 2 million shares, with a par value of 10 yuan per share. At the beginning of last year, the market price was only 17 or 18 yuan, and at the beginning of this year, it was still only 20 or 30 yuan. In late July of this year, it once rose to a high of 167 yuan. In recent months, it has been hovering around 120 yuan. This rise is not only due to the impact of speculators taking turns in the war, but also due to the stimulation from Hong Kong. Hong Kong Chinese stock trading has also been extremely active in recent months. Before the recent air raid, the Shanghai Wing On Company's stock was priced at 60 to 70 Hong Kong dollars in the Hong Kong market; if converted at the local black market exchange rate, it would be more than double the price in this city. If the stock is bought in Shanghai and transported to Hong Kong for sale, a profit of several times can be obtained. The recent rise in the stock price in this city is due to this news. As far as the company's operating conditions are concerned, the average annual dividend is only 2 or 3%. Last year, due to the increase in shares, it paid a one-time dividend of 5.33%; this year, it has been repeatedly affected by the good performance of Wing On Yarn Factory shares. In fact, the average annual dividend of the factory is only about 5%, and in recent years it has been only 1 or 2 points.

New World Company currently has a capital of 3.52 million yuan, divided into 160,000 common shares and 16,000 preferred shares; each share has a par value of 20 yuan. The average annual operating loss is frequent, and dividends are in arrears. In recent years, it has shown slight improvement. Last year, the dividend was 3% including interest, and the stock market was greatly impacted. At the beginning of last year, the market price of the stock was only more than 18 yuan; at the beginning of July of this year, it once jumped to a high of 157 yuan, and recently it has been hovering around 120 or 130 yuan.

China National Products Company currently has a capital of 6 million yuan, divided into 200,000 shares; each share has a par value of 30 yuan. At the beginning of last year, the market price was still below the par value, and before June of this year, the highest price was only 147 yuan. Since the capital increase in the summer of June stimulated the market atmosphere, it has shown its elegance. It once reached 180 yuan. During the 91 Price Stop Order, the company was in the most dangerous situation; the market price was temporarily frustrated; it once entered the 100 yuan level; although it has recovered since then, the footing is still weak, and it suddenly rose by 20 yuan in the five days last week. The reason is due to the stimulation of the capital increase news.

China Underwear Company currently has a capital of 5 million yuan, divided into 500,000 shares, with a par value of 10 yuan per share. The dividend has always been only 1 point, and last year it was 1.8 points. In recent years, it has been frequently affected by capital increases, and trading has been quite active. At the beginning of last year, the market price was still below the par value, and before June of this year, it once jumped to a high of 47.5 yuan. In recent months, it has been lifeless and has been hovering between 32 and 33 yuan. There is still no sign of a turnaround within the last week.

"Correction Notice" In the article on the study of cultural stocks published in this publication, regarding the organization of the Zhonghua Book Company, we recently received a letter from the company stating that the company is now managed by executive directors Wu Youlun and Gao Mu, and there is no chairman of the board. Kong Xiangxi is an ordinary director and does not own many shares in the company. He is not elected and does not attend board meetings. As for the supervisors Huang Yizhi and Xu Keting, they are still in Shanghai today. The corresponding correction is as above.

### Market Trends

Stock Rotation in Department Stores: The surge in Chinese stocks, initially driven by new pharmaceuticals and cultural industries, has now spread to the department store sector. Last week, the market value of sixteen major Chinese commercial stocks rose by an average of 9.2% compared to the previous week. Using June of this year as a baseline (100%), these sixteen Chinese stocks have increased by an average of 61.1%. Among them, the textile industry saw the most significant gains, ranging from 138.2% to 184.1%, followed by the cultural industry, with increases between 58% and 158.5%. The new pharmaceutical and department store sectors still lag behind in comparison.

(Note) Based on the index compiled by the China Economic Research Institute.

Since the local authorities in this city cracked down on speculation, the scope of activities for floating capital has been limited to Chinese stocks, public bonds, and yarn and cloth. Yarn and cloth trading often occurs amidst air raid alarms, and its massive scale prevents ordinary investors from participating. This is unlike Chinese stocks and public bonds, which are more attractive. In recent months, the stock and bond markets have often moved inversely. Previously, the bond market was soaring while the stock market was relatively stable. Recently, the bond market has collapsed, and the stock market has suddenly become active. This demonstrates that the stock market's performance is significantly related to the inflow and outflow of floating capital.

Yarn and Cloth: The yarn and cloth market in this city can be divided into two categories. One is the so-called "black market" centered around "Double Horse" brand, and the other is the cotton industry exchange market centered around "Blue Phoenix" brand. Cloth can also be distinguished between "Dong Pi" (Eastern Cloth) and "Factory Cloth," but Factory Cloth has always followed Dong Pi's Blue Phoenix's lead, and prices are also set by the cotton exchange. Before January 28th Incident, the movements of the Double Horse market were often influenced by gold, foreign exchange, and Blue Phoenix. Since the January 28th Incident, the gold and foreign exchange markets have been shut down. The Double Horse market was also subsequently closed. However, trading in Japanese yarn and cloth remnants continued as before. Speculators took advantage of this opportunity, engaging in private transactions. Initially, they acted secretly, but later they became openly active. The municipal police authorities have entered the market several times to make arrests, as a form of punishment. However, speculators have become accustomed to this.

In recent months, Double Horse trading has long become a normal speculative market, with prices fluctuating unpredictably. Subsequently, they rose sharply and continuously. In early October, the Double Horse market price was only 5,450 yuan per piece, but by the previous week, it had risen to 6,470 yuan. Blue Phoenix also surged from 5,050 yuan to over 5,800 yuan. The prices of various cloth remnants also followed suit, rising continuously. If it were not for rampant speculation, how could it have reached this point? In the previous issue of this publication, it was mentioned that "with this harsh winter approaching, one wonders how people will keep warm." It is believed that the relevant authorities will not ignore this serious situation. However, last week, the yarn and cloth market situation intensified, with Double Horse factory orders rising to 7,050 yuan, and spot prices reaching 6,500 yuan. Blue Phoenix yarn also surged from 5,800 yuan to over 6,200 yuan. This situation was indeed something that the relevant authorities could not ignore, leading to the decisive measures taken on the weekend, completely banning transactions in Double Horse factory orders and spot goods. This action had a cooling effect, and yarn and cloth prices all collapsed. According to yesterday's Dong Bao newspaper, outstanding Double Horse transactions are now being settled at 6,600 yuan. The market price of Dong Pi factory cloth has uniformly fallen by 23 to 45 yuan. However, looking back at the revival of the Double Horse black market, it is hoped that the relevant authorities will also implement further management of other free yarn and cloth transactions.

Bond Market Stabilizes: The bond market's collapse in the previous week was due to Japanese newspapers widely reporting sanction news, followed by Chinese newspapers. This caused panic, and market sentiment immediately weakened. All bonds uniformly plummeted. In the previous issue of this publication, it was stated that "future trends will depend on whether outsiders reveal the cards in their hands or keep them hidden." These cards were not revealed last week, and the bond market has since stabilized.

Comparing the market trends from last Saturday to Monday, all bonds except for Types B and D have slightly increased. However, they were generally weak throughout the week. This shows that investor confidence has not yet recovered, and this week should provide more clarity.

### The Story of a Little Mouse

— Lin Bao

Once upon a time, in the land of fables, there lived a little mouse who was neighbors with a great magician. This little mouse was inherently afraid of cats, trembling all day long. The great magician, seeing its pitiful state, transformed it into a cat, hoping to rid it of its fear. However, after becoming a cat, it became afraid of dogs. So, the great magician transformed it into a fierce dog. Unexpectedly, after becoming a dog, it became afraid of tigers. Next, the great magician transformed it into a majestic tiger, but it became afraid of hunters. Finally, the great magician, overwhelmed with frustration and disappointment, sighed and said, "Alas! It's better to be your little mouse. Because you are timid as a mouse, even giving you the body of a more magnificent animal is useless." In the end, the little mouse remained a little mouse.

### Benevolent Disease

— Mo Ming

If you know someone who has never been sick in their entire life, you will admire their health, happiness, and well-being; others will also envy their health, happiness, and well-being. They themselves will feel their health, happiness, and well-being. They are indeed healthy, happy, and well-being. However, I am sorry to say that they have not truly enjoyed the joy and happiness of health.

I can't remember who said it: "Someone who eats delicacies every day is the same as never eating delicacies at all." If someone is born into a wealthy environment and eats sumptuous meals three times a day without interruption, we will say that this person has the good fortune to enjoy delicious food, but they themselves will not be able to say how delicious it tastes, because what they experience is only ordinary, not outstanding.

The meaning of health is not mechanical either. We need illness to constitute a person's complete health. In other words, if a person has never experienced the pain of being unhealthy, they cannot truly know the joy of health. As the saying goes: "Only when you are sick do you know that being healthy is like being an immortal," which shows that entering the realm of health is not when you are healthy. Therefore, disease and doctors are equally important to health.

Remember that everything in this world is relative and complementary: where there is positive, there must be negative; where there is fullness, there must be emptiness; where there is darkness, there must be light. As Rousseau said: to imagine the scenery of spring, you need to be in winter; the word "freedom" is more meaningful only in prison. If humans had never been sick since their existence, it is doubtful whether the words "health," "Health," "Sante," "Gesundheit," etc., would still exist in today's dictionaries.

A person who is never sick in their entire life—can you find such a lucky, yet unfortunate, enviable, yet pitiful person? I believe that such a discovery is impossible. Our disease is not stingy at all, and its alms are very common and widespread; everyone in the world can more or less benefit from its grace. Of course, it is not without unfair faults, and it only allows a few people to experience the greatest joy of health. This makes it impossible for us to make a complete defense for it, saying that it does not have a trace of partiality when giving alms.

In fact, the term "disease" is very inappropriate, whether judged by our knowledge or emotions. This is truly a term that is most likely to cause antipathy. Why should there be such an unnecessary misunderstanding? Even if we don't welcome "disease," why should we treat it with such a deeply disgusted attitude after it has come? Why are you always trembling, mourning, and crying in illness? You should make disease beneficial to you, and you should not easily let go of this opportunity. Disease can at least add some meaning to your life, perhaps like: creating a ripple on a calm surface of water, or adding a few clouds to a bleak sky.

Of course, we cannot ignore the most unfortunate results of disease, but this should not be entirely the responsibility of "disease"; we especially do not want to say that this is its original intention when it descends. Its original intention is only to give you a few days of plain meals, taste a few days of bitter fruit, or simply go hungry for a few days among your daily feasts—you will not welcome any of this, but without this opportunity, you will have no way to determine or enhance the meaning of the word "feast" in your sumptuous meals.

Should we consider disease as malicious or benevolent?

### Do One Good Deed Every Day

— Sun Jia

I remember when I was in middle school, the most troublesome thing every Sunday night was writing the weekly journal that was due on Monday under the dim light of the self-study room. We were Boy Scouts, and Boy Scouts must "do one good deed every day." The weekly journal had a pre-printed form with a space for each day, waiting for you to fill in the "good deeds" you did each day. But oh my goodness! Racking my brains, where could I find a trace of doing good deeds? This didn't matter much, but the most distressing thing was that, for the sake of the conduct score, I had to fill out the form, so I had no choice but to falsely fabricate good deeds against my will.

I don't know which classmate came up with the idea, and wrote this "good deed" in the weekly journal: "This morning, when I was defecating, I found that the toilet seat in the lavatory was not closed, which was unhygienic and unsightly, so I closed it for them." From then on, in the weekly journals of the classmates, you closed the toilet seat, and he closed the toilet seat, and a "closing" trend prevailed. In the end, the teacher said humorously: "Students are too diligent in 'closing toilet seats'. We only see closing toilet seats, but we don't see opening toilet seats. Students are all closing them, so they must have been opened and forgotten to be closed by the teachers. This spirit is truly admirable." This is just a childhood joke. Some people think that doing good deeds must be based on money. Only lending some money to a poor friend counts as doing a good deed. Such acts of kindness are too narrow, because providing financial assistance to friends is only one type of good deed.

Any act in the world that benefits mankind, when carried out through your hands, can be considered a good deed.

For example, if you are an honest businessman, treat each of your employees generously, providing them with warm clothing and sufficient food. Don't raise prices, don't hope to gain improper profits, and faithfully serve others—this is also "doing good deeds."

There is no greater good deed in the world than encouraging others and helping them to improve. Often, in difficult and frustrating circumstances, because of a word of encouragement, a word of inspiration from you, your friend's bright and brilliant future will unfold. "Pouring cold water" is the most despicable act. Know that enthusiasm can overcome all obstacles. Let me tell you: in history, someone said a few gentle, comforting, and sympathetic words, which once restored the courage of the famous orator Cov and made him famous. Remember that a great philosopher once asked his students: "What is the most lovely thing in the world?" There were many answers, but in the end, the student replied: "Doing good deeds is the most lovely." Then the philosopher smiled brightly and nodded, saying: "Your words include all the words of others."

Friends! "Doing good is the greatest joy," "Do one good deed every day." Please do not ignore these two sentences in your daily life!

### Sharing the Same Boat in Storms

— He Jia Zhi

11. Enemies

Wei Cheng said, "I don't know who this man is either. I'll tell you: this person is the one who murdered my father; he is my enemy. On this photo, he wrote himself, his surname is Cheng, and his given name is Bing, Cheng Bing." Strangely enough, when Huang Long heard that this person was the one who killed Wei Cheng's father, his eyes suddenly widened, and he exclaimed "Ah!" and held the half-length photo of Cheng Bing in his hands, trembling. Wei Cheng said, "Here you go again, listen to me finish." Wei Cheng briefly recounted the events of the past, mentioning that the picture frame fell and broke the glass, and that's when he discovered this photo. Huang Long was touched by Wei Cheng's attitude and became more gentle, saying, "What you're saying isn't right! You said he's Miss Chen's father, whose surname is Cheng, but his daughter's surname is Chen, how do you explain that?" Wei Cheng said, "I thought of that too, but can't Cheng Bing have changed his surname from Cheng to Chen later? I remember that Guo Qi and Guo Fang's father was Chen Youlong. I haven't seen Chen Youlong, and you haven't seen Chen Youlong either, so we can't be sure that Chen Youlong is Cheng Bing, right?" Huang Long said, "That doesn't matter. Wei Cheng, what do you plan to do now? If Cheng Bing is really Miss Chen's father, can you spare him for Miss Chen's sake?" Wei Cheng was provoked by Huang Long and his eyes also turned red with anger, saying, "What are you talking about? You haven't read many books, and you didn't read them carefully even when you did. The enmity between parents is irreconcilable, the ancients said so. As long as it's Cheng Bing himself, I will kill him. There can't be both him and me. I don't care whose father he is." Huang Long said, "You're right, I was just testing you. Now that you've said that, this matter is easy to handle. Leave it to me, okay?"

Wei Cheng was a little surprised by Huang Long's confidence and asked, "You said it's easy to handle, how do you handle it? Huang Long said, "Hey, you're a scholar, can't you be smarter than me? You know where Miss Chen lives. As long as I take a letter from you and ask Miss Chen if your father is Cheng Bing. If she says yes, one strike and Cheng Bing's head and shoulders will be separated. If she says no, then we can't kill people casually. I'll just slip the knife into my sock and come back and tell you it's not him. Wei Cheng, you didn't even think of that." (224)

### Porcelain

— Zhang Zhi Ting

Porcelain is the essence of China, and its origins are ancient. The products of famous kilns in our country throughout the ages, such as the carved porcelain of the Ding kiln in the Song Dynasty, the blue and white multicolored porcelain of the Yi kiln in the Ming Dynasty, and the Wanli porcelain, Kangxi and Qianlong kilns, pine tree figure porcelain, and the ring-shaped bottom mark of the Yi kiln in the Qing Dynasty, and the Guyuexuan painted enamel porcelain, are the most valuable products of the Qing Dynasty. These works of art are characterized by beautiful styles, smooth glaze, delicate porcelain, and elegant colors. Although European and American countries have also tried to imitate them, they often sigh that they are inferior. English and American people call China "China," which means the country that produces porcelain, so it is not accidental that porcelain is the essence of the country.

In my country's export commodities over the years, porcelain was originally an important one. Unfortunately, in recent years, due to the crude and shoddy manufacturing by Chinese people and the failure to seek improvement, the products have become increasingly outdated, and the number of exports has also decreased day by day.

The places in my country that produce the most porcelain are Jiangxi Fuliang County (also known as Jingdezhen) and Fujian. It is said that the people of Fuliang County are mostly engaged in the manufacture of porcelain for a living since the Tang Dynasty because the land is barren and the harvest from farming is not much. As for the places that produce the most pottery, they are Yixing and other counties in Jiangsu. However, most of the residents who manufacture porcelain and pottery are ignorant and stick to old methods, and are deeply poisoned by superstition, so they rarely make improvements. The secrets of making pottery by the ancients, handed down to this day, are still known by a very small number of people; unfortunately, these people think that they have rare goods to sell, and they never teach others, and they hold the concept that they only pass it on to their sons and not to their daughters, so the outside world knows very little about this ancient method of making porcelain, and there is a possibility that it will become a lost art at any time, which is really a pity!
