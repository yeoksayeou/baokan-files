### Gandhi Issues Statement: Plans Final Appeal to Viceroy, But Not an Ultimatum; White House Does Not Intend to Intervene in Indian Situation

Havas, Bombay, 6th: Mahatma Gandhi of India stated to the press today that the National Congress Party plans to make a final appeal to Lord Linlithgow, the British Viceroy of India, but it is not in the nature of an ultimatum. In fact, it is merely that "I will write to Viceroy Linlithgow, and I will do everything I can to avoid an open conflict. If our suggestions are adopted, negotiations can begin," he said. It is also learned that Gandhi is scheduled to deliver a speech to the Executive Committee of the National Congress Party tomorrow. The content of the speech is unknown, but it is known that he will defend his proposal currently submitted to the Executive Committee, which advocates that a liberated India should first negotiate with Japan.

Haitong News Agency Telegram from Bangkok, 7th: According to news from Bombay, Gandhi met with British and American journalists in Bombay and answered various questions, stating briefly that negotiations with Japan would be difficult to achieve. India must first achieve independence. It would be dangerous if the Allied powers insisted on delaying India's independence until after the war. A reporter asked if Britain allowed India to be independent, would he set a deadline for negotiations? Gandhi replied that he had not considered limiting the duration of negotiations.

Allied News Agency Telegram from Lisbon, 7th: According to news received here, the Executive Committee of the Indian National Congress Party has passed a new resolution to respond to the Governor-General's Office of India's publication of Gandhi's proposal. How the new resolution will deal with the case of negotiations with Japan, which Gandhi implied in his original proposal, is of great concern to the British and American sides. According to a telegram from New Delhi, an American journalist asked Gandhi, "Can you guarantee that you will not negotiate with Japan in the future?" Gandhi firmly replied, "My negotiations with Japan are for the consideration of our interests, so I cannot guarantee that I will not negotiate with Japan."

Allied News Agency Telegram from Lisbon, 7th: According to news from Washington, a White House spokesman yesterday refused to comment on reports that President Roosevelt might appeal to Gandhi to reconsider his threat to launch a civil disobedience movement.

Havas News Agency Telegram from Washington, 4th: Reports that President Roosevelt telegraphed Gandhi, urging him not to implement the disobedience movement, were met with a refusal to comment by the White House spokesman at a reception for reporters today.

Congress Party Meeting Begins Yesterday

Allied News Agency Telegram from Lisbon, 7th: According to news from Bombay, the All-India Congress Party began its meeting this afternoon to approve the "Quit India" resolution. Indian leader Gandhi addressed the crowd for forty-five minutes during the meeting. Approximately 250 Congress Party members attended. During Gandhi's address, he did not criticize the resolution of the Standing Committee but expressed that after the committee approved the resolution, he would deliver another speech. Gandhi appeared quite thin but very confident. He began his address at 4:00 PM (Indian time). Before Gandhi took his seat, he stood for a moment, responding to the cheers of the crowd with a smile. The band played the Indian national anthem. The audience seats for the meeting were reserved two days in advance, resulting in thousands of people being unable to enter the venue. Therefore, loudspeakers were installed at the venue so that the crowd outside could hear the proceedings of the meeting.

Allied News Agency Telegram from Lisbon, 6th: The All-India Congress Party Congress, which will open in Bombay on the 7th, will hold a historic discussion on the resolution demanding the withdrawal of British forces from India. The proposal, drafted based on the fundamental aim of achieving Indian independence in Gandhi's original proposal, was put forward by Nehru and seconded by Speaker Acharya. It is widely expected that the All-India Congress will support and pass the proposal when it convenes. On the first day of the meeting, Nehru will first present the resolution. However, given the serious nature of the proposal, the discussion is expected to extend to the 8th or 10th. In the meantime, the British side will inevitably carry out final maneuvers inside and outside the Congress in an attempt to create an opposing atmosphere. At the same time, the Governor-General's Office of India may also take various high-pressure measures. Regarding this matter, according to news from Bombay, the Indian Governor-General's Office has mobilized the police force to prepare for any eventuality.

Acharya Asks for Support of Claims

Allied News Agency Telegram from Lisbon, 6th: According to a telegram from Bombay, in view of the fact that the Governor-General's Office of India deliberately distorted the publication of Gandhi's original proposal, causing misunderstanding among people around the world, in order to thoroughly understand the true meaning of the Indian independence movement, Acharya, the speaker of the Indian National Congress Party, decided to send letters to Chongqing, Roosevelt, and other Allied heads of state, requesting support for the claims of the National Congress Party.

Allied News Agency Telegram from Lisbon, 7th: All India Radio broadcast that Acharya, the Chairman of the All-India National Congress Party, announced this morning that British and American troops must leave India immediately.

### Conference to Open Second Front Reportedly Held in Moscow; Many British and American Diplomats to Attend; Roosevelt Representative Meets Stalin

British Prime Minister's Trip to Soviet Union of Great Importance

Havas News Agency Telegram from Helsinki, 6th: Political figures here already consider British Prime Minister Churchill's trip to Moscow to be certain. Most newspapers believe that Churchill's trip is of great importance, as it is rumored that the Soviet Union threatened to make a separate peace with Germany if a second front was not opened in the near future. A Berlin correspondent for the "Hufvudstadsbladet" newspaper telegraphed that the Soviet Union had notified Britain to prepare for a separate peace with Germany. Upon receiving this notice, Churchill hurriedly set off for Moscow in an attempt to prevent the Soviet Union from taking this step. Churchill also intends to obtain assurances from the Soviet Union that it will defend the Caucasus at all costs, as the loss of this important area would jeopardize nearby British territories. On the Soviet side, it is believed that the Caucasus is not an important area and that defending the Caucasus can only be done when Britain launches a war in Western Europe. Therefore, the main force of the Red Army is now concentrating on the areas that it considers important, namely Stalingrad and the Volga River. At the same time, Finnish newspapers attach great importance to the Caucasus offensive, believing that it can compensate for the failure of the Leningrad offensive. Finnish forces are tying down a large number of enemy troops on the front lines, providing great assistance to the German army. The pro-German organization "Uussuomi" newspaper reported that Germany believes that the war has not yet reached its end stage and that Germany and its enemies will have to fight for a considerable amount of time. This situation will affect every country in Europe, so this winter, we must still prepare to make military and material efforts.

Haitong News Agency Telegram from Berlin, 7th: The German Foreign Ministry spokesman did not comment on the rumors of a meeting between Churchill and Stalin yesterday.

Public Opinion Demands Unified Command

Havas News Agency Telegram from Zurich, 6th: The Neue Zürcher Zeitung published a telegram from its London correspondent today, stating that public opinion in Britain and the United States is unanimously demanding a unified command, or at least its implementation in Europe as soon as possible. The Soviet Union also advocates the establishment of a unified command. Soviet military expert General Shurovsky, who visited London with Foreign Minister Molotov in May of this year, published an article in the Times of London yesterday, analyzing the strategy of the last World War, and said that the Allies were able to achieve final victory in 1918 because the Allies worked hard, adjusted well, and had a way to achieve it. The current war situation is very similar to that of 1918. German troops are taking the offensive everywhere, but this offensive is only intended to conceal the truth in their country. Therefore, the Soviet Union and its allies will achieve victory earlier than generally expected. British military and political figures believe that this article is of great significance. The Soviet Embassy in England attaches even greater importance to this and has printed the article into a booklet and distributed it to important figures in Britain and foreign countries.

Havas News Agency Telegram from London, 6th: 105,686 workers from various industries in the London area recently elected 171 representatives and submitted a petition to Prime Minister Churchill, demanding the immediate opening of a second front, stating briefly, "We can no longer sit idly by and watch the Soviet Union sacrifice alone. It must be understood that our glory and status are in danger. If we do not immediately open a first front, it will be too late. Therefore, we advocate immediate action."

### Summer Epidemic Prevention: Outbreaks of Seasonal Diseases Mostly Due to Careless Diet; Strengthening the Stomach and Intestines Can Reduce Infection

Those annoying flies are everywhere, filling the human world. Because of their coming and going, they are ambushing the crises of human life everywhere. The most important intestinal diseases are dysentery and typhoid fever. A moment of carelessness can lead to them depriving one of life. The reason for being infected with these diseases is mostly due to careless diet, bringing all sorts of dysentery germs and typhoid germs into the intestines, giving them the opportunity to breed and rage in the human body. Their symptoms are briefly written below! "Cholera," commonly known as tiger cholera, is the most terrible epidemic, which can end a person's life in a very short period! Mild cases are nothing more than vomiting and diarrhea a few times, a headache or dizziness, slight fatigue, and cold limbs, and can be cured in about a week, while severe cases are often fatal, with severe vomiting and excretion, sunken eye sockets, sunken finger screws, pale face, thirst, hoarse voice, and spasms. However, people with weak bodies are more likely to get this disease. If they take the body-strengthening and blood-nourishing "Roxu", their physique will become strong and their resistance to germs will be strong, and they will never suffer from this disease.

"Typhoid fever" usually lasts about four weeks. In the first week, appetite is poor, and one feels tired and has a fever. In the second week, the fever increases, about 39 to 40 degrees Celsius, consciousness is unclear, there is delirium, the tongue coating is dry, dark, and thick, while the tip of the tongue is peeled off. This week is the most dangerous. If one does not pay attention in the third week, such as intestinal ulcers, there may even be bleeding, perforation, and the temperature will drop, inevitably leading to exhaustion and death; but if one passes the third week without this phenomenon, then the body temperature will return to normal after the fourth week, and all symptoms will disappear, gradually recovering.

"Dysentery" is generally divided into red and white types, but red dysentery is more severe, and is also commonly known as dysentery. Mild cases are similar to colitis, with severe abdominal pain, urgency and tenesmus during excretion, and mucus in the stool, but severe cases have ulcers in the intestines, blood in the stool, fatigue, lack of energy, and increased frequency of excretion, often leading to death.

In summary, these three diseases cause great suffering and even death due to temporary carelessness. How can one not be careful? Therefore, the ancients said: "Disease enters through the mouth, and misfortune comes from the mouth." This is indeed true. However, dietary caution cannot be guaranteed to be so accurate. Now, there is a savior, more reliable and convenient than getting vaccinations, which is the most famous "Roxu". It is the most reliable and safest preventive medicine. If you do not want to suffer from disease, quickly take this great Roxu. "Roxu" contains ingredients such as vitamin B, powerful digestive enzymes, hormones, etc., so it has special effects. (Available at pharmacies everywhere)

### Large-Scale Tank Battle Unfolds Southwest of Stalingrad: German Military Announces Capture of Three Cities; Soviet Reserves Deployed from the Don River Bend

Moscow, July 7th, Reuters—According to the midnight communiqué from the Soviet Information Bureau, Soviet forces led by General Timoshenko are compelled to continue retreating south of the lower Don River. Stalingrad is now facing a new threat from German forces in the area south of Kotelnikovo (50 miles east of Tsimlyansk, on the south bank of the Don River). The communiqué stated: "On August 6th, Soviet forces engaged in intense fighting in the areas of Kletskaya, south of Kotelnikovo, south of Belaya Glina, and south of Koshevskaya. No significant changes occurred in other sectors of the front." It further added, "Heavy fighting continues in and south of the Kletskaya area."

Lisbon, July 7th, Central News Agency—German forces continue to advance to a railway line 160 kilometers southwest of Stalingrad, breaking through the Soviet defense line in one go. The Soviet forces are putting up strong resistance and are currently engaged in a large-scale tank battle centered on this railway line. German forces are using tank armies and mechanized units to push forward in the front lines, suppressing the Soviet forces. In the tug-of-war in the Don River bend, although the German forces have the upper hand, Soviet forces are repeatedly launching counterattacks in various locations. The war in this area has reached a decisive stage.

Berlin, July 7th, Huitong News Agency—According to the German High Command, street fighting occurred before Soviet forces withdrew from Tikhoretsk in the Caucasus region. This city is a railway hub. Soviet forces used armored vehicles to assist in counterattacks but were repelled. German and allied forces continue to advance south. Enemy forces north of Voroshilovgrad attempted to break through to the east but were repelled by German forces. Remnants of Soviet forces north of Armavir were either annihilated or captured. German aircraft destroyed many vehicles and horse-drawn carts. A fuel depot was bombed and caught fire. The retreating Soviet forces were also bombed, and transportation lines in the Soviet rear were heavily bombed, including the Kagalnaya station west of Armavir and the port of Tuapse on the Black Sea coast. This port is a hub for roads, railways, and pipelines. Romanian troops are fighting alongside German forces between the Don River and the Caucasus, pursuing the Soviet forces and capturing many prisoners. German aircraft shot down 39 enemy aircraft in the southern part of the Eastern Front, and anti-aircraft units also shot down several enemy aircraft.

Xiongcheng, July 7th, Reuters—Reports from Moscow indicate that the southern German forces attacking the important industrial city of Stalingrad on the Volga River have broken through Kotelnikovo (100 miles southeast of Stalingrad) and cut off the railway from Stalingrad to Krasnodar in that area. This development makes the situation facing Stalingrad even more dangerous, as a second threat from the Don River bend is progressing. Meanwhile, the German forces south of the Don River continue to advance deep into the Caucasus. Reports from London believe that the threat to the Soviet oil fields in the Caucasus has increased in the past 24 hours, and General Timoshenko has deployed some of the Soviet reserves from the Don River to resist the German advance.

Berlin, July 7th, Reuters—The German High Command announced today that German forces, starting from a bridgehead established on the Kuban River, continue to advance deep into the Caucasus and have now reached within 30 miles north of the important oil-producing center of Maikop. According to war reports, German forces have also captured Timoshevskaya (the capital of the Kuban region), a crossroads on the Rostov-Krasnodar railway, as well as Yeysk and Armavir.

Stockholm, July 7th, Havas—The Soviet government newspaper "Pravda" recently reported that German forces near Kletskaya on the Kuban front have received reinforcements, including several infantry divisions and many tanks. According to German prisoners of war, the German forces in this area have suffered heavy losses, with the 35th German Division having lost most of its strength. Fierce air battles between German and Soviet forces are taking place over the Don River.

Soviet General to Use Mountains to Stop German Advance

Stockholm, July 7th, Havas—According to reports from the Eastern Front, large-scale infantry and tank battles have taken place in the steppes between Kotelnikovo and the Volga River in the past two days. Despite fierce resistance from the Red Army, they were eventually forced to abandon their positions. Neutral military observers believe that after occupying Tsimlyanskaya, German forces have now penetrated deep into an area between the Don and Sal Rivers and are approaching the Volga River, threatening Stalingrad from the south. The Red Army has reportedly committed almost all of its motorized units to try to stop the German forces from reaching the Volga River. Soviet military circles acknowledge that the Red Army on the Stalingrad front is in a difficult situation. The city is not only threatened from the west and northwest but is also under threat from the south. The Red Army has been unable to stop the German advance. The fighting in the Kletskaya area northwest of Stalingrad is becoming increasingly fierce. The Red Army claims to be holding its ground and even launching local counterattacks, but the German offensive is increasing with each passing day. The German forces are also using paratroopers to land in the Soviet rear, disrupting important transportation lines. This "airborne infantry" has landed on the east bank of the Don River to cut off the transportation lines between the Don River bend and Stalingrad. The German forces have air superiority, a fact that Moscow news reports also acknowledge without reservation. The Soviets claim that groups of 25 to 30 German aircraft are constantly flying over the front lines and the Red Army's rear, monitoring Soviet air bases, thereby greatly hindering the activities of the Soviet Air Force. According to reports from the Caucasus front, German forces have cut off the Maikop-Baku railway at Nevinnomyssk. The fall of Armavir is only a matter of time, and Krasnodar to the north is also under threat. However, it is becoming increasingly difficult for German forces to approach the Caucasus oil region. So far, the area through which the German forces have passed is a steppe, and motorized units can move freely. Beyond this lies the Caucasus Mountains, with deep valleys, dense forests, and steep cliffs, which will block the advance of tanks. Given this terrain, the Soviet forces can take advantage of natural obstacles to wait for the enemy in a relaxed manner, and the German advance will inevitably be delayed. The only area where German tanks can still move freely is the triangular area from Prokhladny to Kropotkin to the Kuban River.

Bern, July 6th, Havas—In the past 24 hours, the pressure exerted by German forces in the Kuban region of the Caucasus and the Stalingrad region has increased without diminishing. The position of the Red Army is deteriorating and becoming increasingly critical. For example, the Red Army in the Kuban region has lost the ability to prevent German forces from occupying the oil center of Maikop. However, once the Red Army retreats to the Caucasus Mountains, its resistance will inevitably increase. The Red Army's high command, in view of the Red Army's fierce fighting for several weeks, hasty retreats, disordered ranks, and greatly weakened combat effectiveness, deems it necessary to reorganize many units. The left wing of General Timoshenko's forces is currently resolutely resisting, preventing the German forces from advancing towards Krasnodar, but this situation is not enough to cause anxiety among German military circles, as they are deeply convinced that the increased resistance of the Red Army is due to the critical situation of the Red Army on the Taman Peninsula, forcing them to fight like a cornered beast. Since the German forces crossed the Yeya River, they have been continuing to advance in the area around the Sea of Azov. And because the German forces have already occupied the Kerch Peninsula, there is no need to land on the Taman Peninsula. According to military experts, the Red Army will set up new defenses between Pyatigorsk and the Kuma River. The purpose of this is to prevent German forces from attacking Grozny and its oil fields. The German-Romanian forces continue to advance between the Don and Sal Rivers and have reached an important position that threatens the right flank of the Red Army's defenses between the Volga and Don Rivers. According to a dispatch from an Italian war correspondent, the nature of the fighting on this line has now changed. The Red Army is now fighting a desperate battle, but the German high command is always able to deploy troops to win, leaving Red Army generals unable to cope. For example, the Italian newspaper reported: "The German forces are preparing to attack, never taking geographical factors into consideration. The Soviet side has never been able to anticipate the enemy's direction and actions, or obtain information in advance. Therefore, every counterattack by the Red Army is too late and consistently fails to stop the German advance."

### Notes on the Nile (Part 2)

By boat from Aswan on the Nile, the scenery on both banks is picturesque. In terms of the customs of the people, it is an exchange of civilization and barbarism, and the beauty of the climate is like entering paradise. From here, it takes eighteen days to reach Luxor, the second largest city in Egypt. The people here are of diverse origins, and people from all over the world can be found. Not far from Aswan, you must first pass a small island called Bahrlf Island. The island has 1,500 residents who are completely isolated from the world and have no blood ties with the outside world. Even the necessities of food and clothing are made by the islanders themselves. Their ancestors were not Arabs but Egyptians. From ancient times to the present, the Assyrians, Greeks, Romans, Arabs, and Turks have repeatedly invaded, but most of them could only reach a few larger cities in Lower Egypt and did not pay attention to the residents of this island. Young men and women on the island choose their spouses from among the 1,500 people.

All the residents of the island are actually like one family. There are many small villages like this in Upper Egypt. Marriages are chosen from among people of the same ethnicity. There was a village with more than 4,000 residents, but only three families. In several dynasties in Egypt, it was even popular for half-siblings to marry. The current marriage relationships are still circling among close relatives, but marriages between half-siblings are not often encountered. Egyptians are still strong and robust today, and it seems that close-kin marriages have not harmed them. For 5,000 years, the habits of thought and action, and the shaping of character, of the Egyptians have changed very little, and this is somewhat related to close-kin marriages. The most important change is that the residents have converted to Islam, but among the foolish men and women, the heretical religions of divination and armor are still popular, and absurd and unfounded superstitions. These heretical doctrines and foolish acts have penetrated deep into people's hearts and have been passed down for thousands of years.

Everything on Bahrlf Island completely retains the ancient flavor and is somewhat similar to the murals in ancient Egyptian tombs. There are few differences and many similarities.

Traveling north from Bahrlf Island, you reach another village called El Agaba, located on the bank of the Nile River, with a railway passing nearby. The village is equipped with an electric engine that draws water from the Nile River to irrigate the farmland. In terms of equipment, it is considered modern, but the ancient customs are still preserved: whenever an important person in the village dies, only women weeping loudly can be seen on the streets, raising their hands, crying out to the heavens and the earth, and crying and shouting with all their strength. Such loud weeping often lasts for several days, and even whispers cannot be heard. And it is not just weeping, but also disheveling the hair, tearing clothes, and covering the body with mud. It is said that this ritual was required for funerals in the Old Kingdom 5,000 years ago to "express grief."

It is only a few dozen steps from the power plant to the village, but the distance between the two is at least 3,000 years. The houses in the village are made of river mud, which has been the main material for building houses in the Nile River basin since ancient times. Some are more elaborate and use bricks made of river mud to build houses. The method of making mud bricks is extremely simple. First, the river mud is mixed, then poured into a wooden mold, the excess mud on top is leveled off, and the wet mud bricks are patted out and placed in the sun to dry. The scene in the village is like turning the pages of an ancient Egyptian book: a pottery worker is making a kettle by hand; an old man sits next to a palm tree, pulling down the fibers of the palm tree and twisting them into ropes; women are weaving baskets similar to those of the Third Dynasty or spinning yarn and weaving cloth on looms from the Twelfth Dynasty. A barber is shaving a child's head, leaving a tuft of hair unshaved, which is said to be a religious custom. Carpenters saw boards not by laying them flat but by sawing them vertically, just like in ancient murals. The plows and harrows used by farmers are exactly the same as those depicted on the tombs of ancient emperors.

There is only one ethnic type here, and that is that in the bustling cities, even if the blood of the locals has been mixed with Arab, Turkish, or Greek blood, the result is not a composite race, but still an Egyptian race. The desert, the sun, and the Nile River seem to be the three masters who rule this land, giving the people who grow on this soil the same type of character and habits. The scenery of Luxor, the second largest city in Upper Egypt, on the banks of the Nile, with temples built in the time of the Pharaohs in the distance.

### Brief Relief from Oppressive Heat After Rain Shower Yesterday; Autumn Begins Today, Cooler Weather Expected; Strict Inspection of Quarantine Certificates, Intensified Vaccination Efforts

After being hit by a heat wave, this city has not experienced any abatement in the scorching heat. Yesterday, after 9:00 a.m., the temperature rose in a straight line, reaching 101.7 degrees by noon. Therefore, it was predicted at the time that the afternoon temperature would inevitably surpass the 103.6 degrees of the previous day. However, around noon, clouds suddenly appeared, obscuring the sunlight, and the temperature did not rise. From 2:30 p.m. to 5:00 p.m., the scorching sun emerged from the clouds again, but fleeting clouds lingered, and sparse raindrops fell in the central district of the International Settlement, while the central district and suburbs of the French Concession, such as Xujiahui, experienced showers at noon. However, after 3:00 p.m., the rain stopped, and the sunlight from then on was weak and powerless, and the temperature dropped. The weather turned cooler, and although it was not a rain that ushered in autumn, the sudden change from oppressive heat to overcast skies was refreshing.

Oppressive Heat, Initial Showers

The hot weather has not subsided for days, and the weather was even more oppressive yesterday morning, reaching over 100 degrees in the early hours. Around 11:00 a.m., the sky was covered with dark clouds, and the sky suddenly became gloomy. Then, a sudden shower came, but this shower was only in the Xuhui area of the French Concession. Only a few raindrops were found in other nearby areas. However, although the rain was slight, it slightly diminished the oppressive heat, so the weather was slightly cooler in the afternoon. Moreover, autumn begins this afternoon, the hot summer has passed, and the weather may become cooler.

Inspection of Quarantine Certificates in the International Settlement

Since the authorities of the International Settlement announced that citizens must hold a quarantine certificate to be allowed to pass through the International Settlement, otherwise they will not be allowed to enter the International Settlement, armed detectives have been stationed at various intersections on the border of the International Settlement in recent days, assisted by members of the Self-Defense Corps, who are divided into entrances and exits at each intersection to strictly inspect quarantine certificates. Any citizen who does not have the certificate is prohibited from entering or leaving. The enforcement is very strict from morning to night.

Sharp Increase in Number of Exposed Corpses Due to Intense Sun

The scorching sun is rampant, and the oppressive heat is unbearable. As a result, the general refugees and beggars in the two concessions, without shelter, are exposed to the scorching sun and suffer from starvation, resulting in a sharp increase in deaths. According to the Pushan Villa, from August 1st to 6th, the number of corpses collected and buried by the villa due to the above reasons was: 51 large and 95 small on the 1st, 47 large and 74 small on the 2nd, 45 large and 83 small on the 3rd, 35 large and 88 small on the 4th, 31 large and 84 small on the 5th. The previous day was one of the hottest days, and the number of corpses increased sharply, with 56 large and 124 small.

Intensified Vaccination Efforts

The English-language "Shanghai Times" reported that about 60,000 people have been vaccinated in the two concessions, of which 11,030 applied for vaccination in the French Concession, and 37,726 were residents of the International Settlement. As of now, one million people have been vaccinated in the French Concession, with 45,000 still to be vaccinated. At the same time, the International Settlement has vaccinated 1.5 million people. As of Wednesday evening, 942 cholera cases had been discovered in the Chinese area, of which 153 people had died. According to a report from the French Concession authorities, a total of 314 people in the area have been infected this year, but 188 of them have not yet been confirmed as cholera patients. The number of deaths is 318. The International Settlement has so far discovered 214 cases, of which 44 people have died, including one foreigner. On Wednesday, the Health Department of the Municipal Council reported that it had received reports of 25 new cholera cases, with 9 deaths, and the French Concession reported 15 cases, with one death.

Overcrowding at Outpatient Clinics of Infectious Disease Hospitals

The hot weather has lasted for more than 20 days, and the heat wave is getting worse every day. The epidemic is also becoming more severe, which is a major threat to the health of the city's residents. According to inquiries at the Shanghai Infectious Disease Hospital at 25 Yuqiaoqing Road, the number of outpatients yesterday (August 6th) reached as many as 963, which is one of the highest number of outpatients in the hospital's 24-year history. The prevalence of the epidemic is really frightening. The doctors and staff of the hospital are busy day and night saving patients. If the heat wave does not subside and there is no rain for a long time, the number of infected people will increase, which is very worrying. I hope that citizens will pay attention to food hygiene to maintain their health.

Third Isolation Hospital Opens

A public notice from the Information Office of the Municipal Council stated that the Third Chinese Isolation Hospital established by the bureau at 9 Singapore Road will be opened at 12:00 noon this (8th) morning to accommodate patients with infectious diseases. The two Chinese isolation hospitals on Beihai Road and Xinzhazhi Road will stop admitting patients until further notice. This public notice is hereby issued.

### Bread Rationing Begins Yesterday; All Purchases Must Be Made with a Certificate; Bread Prices Slightly Increased

The "Shanghai Times" reported that the bread rationing plan adopted by the authorities will be implemented from today (July 7th). Residents of the International Settlement, the French Concession, and the Western District who have not received rice rations will be able to purchase only 10 taels of bread per person per day from today. It is noted that as of yesterday (July 6th), there were no restrictions on the sale of bread, but in the future, those who have not received rice rations must purchase bread with a bread ration certificate. There are two types of ration certificates: white and yellow. The white certificate is issued to residents who have not received rice rations, and the certificate holder can purchase 10 taels of bread. The yellow certificate is issued to residents who have already received rice rations, and the certificate holder can only purchase 4 taels of bread. Bread ration certificates are issued once a month, divided into daily coupons. According to the authorities, bread cannot be purchased in advance, and the validity period of each coupon is limited to the date printed on the paper and the next day. Moreover, these ration certificates are issued per person and not per household. Even children between the ages of two and five have this certificate to ensure fair distribution. In the future, the amount of flour that bakeries can receive will be limited to the amount listed on the ration certificates that the store returns to the authorities. All bakeries have received the yellow and white ration certificates issued by the authorities, the number of which is determined according to the total amount of bread consumed previously applied for by the residents.

A public notice from the Information Office of the Municipal Council stated that the bureau deems it necessary to slightly increase the price of bread. The revised prices will be effective from August 10th: (1) Wholesale: 2.50 yuan per pound; (2) Retail: 2.75 yuan per pound. The price of bread of different sizes will be calculated proportionally. For details, please refer to the bureau's announcement No. 6037.

### Hong Kong Establishes Branch of the International Red Cross; Representative in China, Mr. Ilal, Returns to Shanghai; Successful Negotiations with the Japanese Authorities in Hong Kong

The English-language "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury" reported that Mr. Igl, the representative of the International Red Cross in China, has returned to Shanghai after going to Hong Kong to establish a branch of the International Red Cross. He told reporters that he was very satisfied with this trip. However, he cannot comment on the achievements of this trip, his experiences, and the Red Cross's work plans in China until the accumulated documents have been processed. It is reported that as a result of Mr. Ilal's discussions with the local Japanese authorities during this trip to Hong Kong, the work of the International Red Cross in China will be expanded. For example, arrangements will now be made to transport letters and gifts from Shanghai to civilians and prisoners of war detained in Hong Kong. Mr. Ilal left Shanghai on June 12 and arrived in Hong Kong in ten days. A month later, he obtained permission from the Japanese authorities to establish a Hong Kong branch of the International Red Cross, which will be headed by Mr. Qin Tai'er. Mr. Ilal also inspected the prisoner-of-war camps and civilian internment camps in Hong Kong and found the facilities to be quite complete. On the way back, Mr. Ilal made a brief stop in Guangzhou, but only passed through and did not have any Red Cross mission there.

### Tekakura Maru Repatriation Includes Nationals of All Countries

The English-language "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury" reported that Japanese consulate officials recently told reporters that the repatriation ship Tekakura Maru, which is scheduled to leave Shanghai on August 16 for Loreno Marques, will not only carry American nationals. Only a small number of American women who have married British consulate or diplomatic officials will be attached to the ship under the names of the officials' family members. There is no further news regarding plans to send a fifth repatriation ship. It is generally speculated that this fifth ship is the Conte Verde, but this has not been officially confirmed. The Tekakura Maru will carry 900 repatriated British nationals, many of whom are Shanghai residents. Japanese consular officials stated that the Tekakura Maru is reserved for carrying British and European Allied nationals. It is a mistake to say that the ship is repatriating American nationals. However, the fifth ship may carry many Allied nationals, including Americans.

### Numerous Ruthless Bandits Arrested; Habitual Offenders Implicated in Kidnappings and Robberies; Interrogation Concluded, Sentencing Scheduled

Sun Boqun's son, Yi Chen, the scion of a Shanghai flour magnate from Anhui province, was kidnapped at 8:30 AM on September 12th of last year. He was in his private automobile en route to school when, at the corner of Moganshan Road and Tokyo Road, he was abducted and his whereabouts were unknown. A letter was sent to his family demanding a hefty ransom. Eventually, after a payment of 45,000 yuan, he was released. Subsequently, Chinese Detective Feng Baishun, along with Detectives Liu Zhaonian, Liu Shuxun, and Guo Xiangyao from the Shanghai Municipal Council (SMC) Police, apprehended the suspects: Li Chunbao, Guan Shoushan, and Wang Echang, all from Jiangbei. They were transferred to the court for detention pending further proceedings. Investigations revealed that between September of last year and June of this year, these individuals, along with the fugitive Gu Acai and the convicted criminal Shen Zongbao (surnames deliberately obscured), kidnapped Dr. Yao Junian outside No. 819 Wuding Road and abducted the wealthy merchant Ying Jipin near No. 895, Xiaoshadu Road. Additionally, they kidnapped Cai Lanzhou at No. 1074 Mabai Road and robbed Su Xingxing, an SMC watchman, of a pistol with six bullets at No. 1243 Gordon Road, and also stole several hundred yuan worth of property from Chen Zhengxiang's residence at No. 37 Carter Road. The police department filed a public prosecution for extortion and robbery, requesting severe punishment. However, Sun Boqun and his son Yi Chen, along with Dr. Yao Junian, wealthy merchant Ying Jipin, and Cai Lanzhou, did not appear in court to testify, nor did they send representatives. When questioned, the three defendants gave evasive answers. Judge Zhao Dui ordered them to remain in custody pending sentencing on a scheduled date.

### The Mystery of the Resident Certificates

Resident certificates, applied for by residents in the French Concession from their respective police stations, are, according to regulations, supposed to be stamped by the head of household, "Jia" head, and "Bao" head, and also require the attachment of a health certificate. However, it is reported that these application forms were submitted to the police stations several months ago, and yet the Bao heads, Jia heads, and heads of household have not received the certificates to distribute to the tenants. Whether there are instances of obstruction or extortion of fees remains unknown.

### SMC Abolishes Bran Purchase Scheme

The Shanghai Municipal Council recently issued Notice No. 6036, announcing the cancellation of Notice No. 5675 (issued on December 18th of last year) and Notice No. 5860 (issued on April 16th of this year) regarding the registration and purchase of bran.

Permits can be obtained from Office No. 801 of the SMC, located at No. 209 Jiangxi Road.

### Fire at Anhe Temple Road

### Report on the Shanghai Buddhist Charity Congee Kitchen

The Shanghai Buddhist Charity Congee Kitchen has already opened. Most of the staff are monks. Congee is distributed exclusively to the elderly and children. Those seeking congee enter through the Guandi Temple gate from Kongjia Lane, in an endless stream. They first go to the verification point to obtain a token and then collect their congee, sitting in the corridors to eat. Upon finishing, they recite Buddhist scriptures and exit. The congee served by the kitchen is reportedly pure and delicious. Each person receives about 40 "liang" of congee. Consequently, many elderly people bring one or two children with them to share the meal. Considering the quota of 3,000 people, the kitchen is actually providing relief to approximately 10,000 individuals. Congee is served from 7:30 AM to 10:00 AM daily. At a time when rice is as precious as pearls and firewood as cinnamon, the kitchen is providing tangible benefits to the poor, which is truly commendable.

### The Living Standards of Chinese Employees, Compiled by the Industrial and Social Affairs Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council (3)

Percentage Distribution of Monthly Household Expenditures on Consumer and Non-Consumer Goods

For employee households, expenses on food and housing account for 62.63% of total expenditure, while clothing and miscellaneous items account for only 37.18%. Generally, the higher the income, the lower the percentage spent on food and the higher the percentage spent on miscellaneous items. During this period of rapid inflation, food and housing costs are the largest, with rice and fuel being particularly burdensome. Expenditures on clothing and miscellaneous items have decreased significantly. The percentage spent on food is very high for both employee and worker households, while the percentage spent on miscellaneous items is lower for worker households. Living standards cannot be fully illustrated by category percentages alone. The following table shows the composition of consumer expenditures.

Note 1: Consumer expenditures plus non-consumer expenditures equal 100.

Note 2: Refers to items such as interest payments, taxes, etc., which are not direct consumption.

Deficit

For the employee class, the average monthly income of the head of household and family members is 611.35 old legal tender yuan, while expenditures reach 885.43 yuan, resulting in a shortfall of 274.08 yuan. Even with other income, there is still a shortfall of 197.05 yuan. In addition to the above income and expenditures, the accounting records also include "other income" and "other expenditures," such as borrowing, withdrawing bank deposits, lending money, and making savings, etc., which are either received and then repaid, or paid and then received. These are not considered actual income and expenditures, but are used to offset the balance. Other income averages 282.27 old legal tender yuan per household per month, and other expenditures are 35.62 yuan. Total income, i.e., monthly income, other income, and other income combined, is 970.65 old legal tender yuan. Total expenditures, i.e., consumer expenditures, non-consumer expenditures, and other expenditures combined, are 921.05 yuan, resulting in a remaining balance of 49.60 yuan. The accounting records show that expenditures exceed deposits, borrowing exceeds repayments. On the other income side, 50 households withdrew deposits, 76 borrowed money, 38 recovered debts, 27 sold old goods, and 10 pawned items. On the other expenditure side, 40 households had some savings, 17 had life insurance, 1 invested, 11 lent money, and 10 repaid debts. Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War more than four years ago, savings have been gradually depleted, and it has become increasingly difficult for those struggling to make ends meet, even with borrowing. All of this is detailed in the records. The summary of income and expenditure is as follows:

Note 3: Includes those who board and servants

Note 4: Does not include those who board and servants

Note 5: Municipal taxes, water, or electricity not included in the rent are included in this category

Note 6: This survey was conducted during the school term, so there are no tuition fees

Wing On Company's stock fell to a low of only 120 yuan, a significant drop of 50 yuan from its high of 170 yuan half a month ago. It closed down 5 yuan compared to the previous day. New Sun's stock fell by 4.5 yuan, while the price of underwear stabilized around 31 yuan. Among cultural stocks, the Commercial Press was the only one to fall, down 3 yuan. The China and World stocks saw little trading at stagnant prices. The New Medicine and New Asia stocks recovered by a small amount of 1 yuan. The China-France stock fluctuated within a small range and remained stable, as did the People's Friendship stock. Zhabei Water and Electricity fell to 33.5 yuan, a staggering drop of 16-17 yuan from its peak. It fell another 1 yuan yesterday. The opening price of the Chinese Wind Company was chaotic, and it also saw a slight decrease. The rest saw little gain or loss. Overall, market sentiment has stabilized, and transaction volumes are weak. A table of stock prices is provided below.

### Cheap Beans Arriving Continuously; Bran Demand Weak

Retail sales of beans remain relatively brisk, but with frequent sales of cheap beans, price increases are difficult. The market is stable. 80 bags of Tianjin green beans were sold at 132 yuan for high-quality beans and 224 yuan for mid-grade beans. 20 bags of Chongming red beans were sold at 164 yuan, and 30 bags of sand silkworm beans were sold at 113 yuan.

The supply and demand for dried sweet potatoes were balanced yesterday, and the market was stable. 40 bags of Jiangbei dried sweet potatoes were sold at 105 yuan. There were also 10 bags of sweet potato flour on the market, priced at 215 yuan per "sima dan."

Sales of bean cakes were slow. A spot transaction of 1,500 pieces of Liuhe Stack bean cakes from the Luodian gang for the month of June was sold at 62 yuan.

Demand for bran remains weak, and market conditions are still soft. 150 small bags of Sansin bran from the May 28th stack were sold at 96 yuan.

Cheap beans from the local area continue to arrive, totaling no less than 10,000 bags. The military distribution team has started distributing them. Yellow beans are priced at 33.50 yuan per "dan" in military notes, green beans at 28.50 yuan, mung beans at 33.50 yuan, and red beans at 29.50 yuan.

### New Lychee Trading Begins

Trading in new lychees has begun. Glutinous rice lychees are priced around 1,600 yuan, ordinary yuan lychees are priced below 600 yuan, and early red lychees are priced at 370 yuan. Asking prices for Chen Lanzhu lychees are unreasonable, and no transactions have been made.

### Sugar Stocks Rise Slightly

Yesterday, sugar stocks traded through the Sugar Merchants Cooperative Business Office turned stable and rose slightly. Coarse sugar stocks opened up 0.5 yuan and closed at 299 yuan, up 1 yuan overall. Red sugar stocks opened at 285 yuan, unchanged from the 4th. Taiche white B Mark traded at 210 yuan. A total of 1,200 bags were traded.

### Retail Sales of Local Nails Remain Good

Retail sales of local nails from nail shops remain steady, with a continuous stream of daily transactions. Market conditions are quite lively. However, wholesale transactions are lacking. Purchases by the Nanyang gang are no longer as strong as they once were, which has had a significant impact on sales of local factory nails. However, the current production volume of local nails has reached its lowest limit, so there is not much stock circulating in the market. For the time being, there is no sign of an imbalance between supply and demand. The current price is 750 yuan per barrel (Beisi).

### The Reasons for the Shortage of Japanese Cigarettes: Market Prices and Factory Prices Have Not Yet Converged; Factory Goods Are Difficult to Distribute, but Retail Sales Are Brisk

The market prices of British and American cigarettes are fluctuating. Factory announcements about distribution have weakened market sentiment. Japanese cigarettes continue to be in short supply because retail sales are very strong. There is no news from the factories about distribution. This is largely because factory prices and market prices have not yet converged, causing the market to gradually rise. Big British Brand cigarettes are priced at 8,200 yuan, Old Blade cigarettes at 5,150 yuan, Product Sea cigarettes at 4,400 yuan, and Five Flowers cigarettes at 3,150 yuan, down 50 to 100 yuan from the previous day. Little Fairy cigarettes are priced at 3,750 yuan, up over 100 yuan. Japanese Golden Gun cigarettes are priced at 1,550 yuan, Red Rose cigarettes at 1,195 yuan, Golden Building cigarettes at 1,700 yuan, Full Luck cigarettes at 1,580 yuan, Ten-Piece Full Luck cigarettes at 1,650 yuan, and Guide cigarettes at 1,350 yuan. The prices of domestic Golden Mouse cigarettes are 1,500 yuan, Beautiful cigarettes are 1,800 yuan, and Pyramid cigarettes are 3,050 yuan. Market conditions are stable.

### Records of Summer Song (1)

— Su Shaoqing

I have an ailment, I love theater. It is the seventh and eighth months, and the drought and heat are oppressive. Even when living at home, I sweat like rain, and I am even less willing to go to the theater to watch plays. However, during social gatherings with friends, when there are actors present, with their laughter and conversation, and sometimes their loud singing, I forget the heat, which is also a pleasure. I will record them one by one to leave a trace.

Ji Yuliang

In early July, the Jiang residence held a gathering of string and bamboo instruments and clear singing. More than twenty people arrived as scheduled. Counting, most of them sang old male roles. Before I arrived, Ji Yuliang had already sung several excerpts. Since I was late and did not hear them, I especially asked Yuliang to sing the "Suddenly I Hear My Mother" excerpt from "Executing the Son." He readily agreed. Amidst the "Huqin" and "Xipi Daoban," he sang the "Angering Yang" excerpt, his voice loud and deafening. He used a "ga" tune on the word "laugh" in "Laughing at the Heroes," high, wide, and powerful, moving the dust with his voice. He and Song Baoluo can be called two eccentrics for their "ga" tunes. Tan Fuying's voice is wide and bright, and is generally recognized as excellent, but he has exhausted his intelligence to make his "ga" tune high enough. Now that Ji and Song are both in Shanghai, their singing is not yet excellent, but whenever they encounter a "ga" tune, it seems effortless, and exceptionally rich. They are truly two eccentrics. After Yuliang finished singing, I insisted on singing the following "Daoban." Yuliang refused, saying there was nothing to listen to. The host, Mr. Jiang, an expert in opera, explained from the side that the "Executing the Son Daoban" was too tiring. He suggested changing the Daoban to "Cannon Fire Shakes Heaven and Earth." He meant the "Xipi Daoban" from "Conquering Taiping." Yuliang agreed, but this caused a laughable incident. All the guests burst out laughing. It turned out that a certain private "Qinshi" of Yuliang thought that he was singing the "Erhhuang Daoban" from "Conquering Taiping," "Wearing a Purple-Gold" excerpt, so he played the "Erhhuang Daoban" prelude. Coincidentally, Ji Yuliang was absent-minded, and sang the "Cannon Fire" excerpt of the "Erhhuang Daoban" following the music. After singing "One Sound," he should have sung "Shakes Heaven and Earth," but Yuliang realized that he was singing an "Erhhuang" melody that he did not sing, so he stopped singing and turned to say, "What's going on?" At this time, Yuliang had a slightly shy look on his face. He said again, "Wrong, let's start over, sing Wearing a Purple." Only then did the guests realize that he had sung it wrong, and they all burst out laughing. Wang Liang turned his face to the wall, preparing to sing again. I thought he was embarrassed, so after singing "Thank you for your services, Madam," the guests applauded.

Chen Dahe

Mr. Chen is a famous amateur singer from Hangzhou, who sings in the Tan style. I met him briefly six or seven years ago, but did not hear him sing. I heard that he was invited to Hankou to sing opera, and he had a colleague, the Hunan "Qingyi" amateur singer Zhu Xiaoqiu. This is a recent event. Now he has repeatedly scheduled to perform "Golden Stage," though it has not yet come to fruition, I imagine he is not returning. I specially asked him to sing. Chen sang the excerpt "From the Day He Returned from Court" from "Hongyang Cave," his voice excellent. He sang the Tan style officially, his tone was between "Ruangong Tiao," and his high notes were extremely bright. His singing technique is above par. There are some subtle details that he has not yet achieved, but this is due to his age. Mr. Chen is only about twenty years old, with delicate features and a figure similar to Zhao Peixin. I have not seen him sing on stage, and do not know what it will be like. If his performance can be seen, then going professional would bring him fame.

### A Plethora of Pure Singing Venues After the Rain

— Sick Dove

The pure singing of female singers has a long history. In the late Qing Dynasty, "Huifang" and "Xiao Guang Han" and others rose up with novel appearances, taking advantage of the times. They were named book venues, and the singers were mostly from brothels, euphemistically called "proofreaders." These people used singing as a front to attract their prostitution business. The audience could order plays at will, and there were girls serving cigarettes and tea, providing a great deal of sensory pleasure. After the Xinhai Revolution, "Tianxian" and "Qunxian" and other trendy opera troupes emerged, and these kinds of book venues gradually declined. Around the tenth year of the Republic of China, amusement parks sprang up, and many of them set up pure singing groups of female singers, renamed "Qunfang Huichang" (Gathering Fragrances Singing). At that time, the Gonghe Hall of the Great World was the most outstanding. The lineup of Qunfang was the most complete. People who visited the Great World at that time mostly gathered in the Gonghe Hall. The grand scene can be imagined. In recent years, this trend has revived. Before the war, "Xiao Guang Han," "Shidai" (Era), and "Changle" (Eternal Joy) were the first three to start classes, vying for customers and competing fiercely. Later, they all closed down due to sluggish business. So far, the only one that survives is "Xiao Guang Han." Recently, the person in charge of "Shidai" pioneered a new gimmick of female singers sitting with guests, stimulating the psychology of the audience, and achieved great results. As a result, business was booming, and it was very popular for a while. Others were envious and opened similar businesses one after another. "Gaole" (High Joy) was created first, followed by "Juele" (Noble Joy). In addition, "Da Luotian" (Great Luo Heaven), although the facilities are simpler, the lineup of female singers is very strong. "Zhang Yuan" newly opened an open-air singing venue, which is unique, and business is not weak. "Tiangong" (Heavenly Palace), which opened yesterday, is not small in scale and has quite elaborate facilities, and is indeed a strong enemy of "Juele." It is said that "Tiangong" has programs such as Pingjin drum besides Peking Opera singing, which is another fresh trick. As for those that are being prepared but have not yet opened, there are "Changle," "Tong Yu Chun," "Renxin," and the old site of the Shanghai Ballroom. However, at present, everything is expensive, and the internal decoration costs are huge, and the talent pool of female singers is limited. The supply is less than the demand, and I am afraid it will not be enough to distribute. Some say that Shanghai people are the most imitative. Seeing that others can do it, they follow suit, regardless of whether there is certainty in the future. A blind man on a blind horse is unlikely to avoid failure. This is the same as the money houses and tobacco shops in the previous period, and the insurance companies and stock companies recently. I am afraid that they will not be able to maintain it in the near future and will close down one after another, becoming a historical relic of the times.

### A Record of Listening to Music with Gold

— Ji Ya

Since childhood, the author has been fond of Peking Opera. When I was studying in Beiping with Luo Jun Tiechen, I often went to listen to opera in my spare time to entertain myself, and Luo Jun devoted himself to studying and imitating, sparing no effort, and has continued to do so to this day. The author, however, has insufficient funds and is constrained by secular affairs. Although I have a penchant for scabies, I can only listen to others sing loudly, while I remain silent. Therefore, I once said that although singing opera is a minor skill, it is not enough to talk about it without talent. First, you must have capital, second, you must have clear pronunciation, third, you must have agile movements, and fourth, you must be able to understand the details. With all four, then you can have room to spare. For example, those who are good at calligraphy can use the brush freely, and no matter whether it is Yan, Liu, Ou, or Su, they can learn their spirit at once. As for those who are not good at calligraphy, even if they spend a lot of effort, they will only be scribbling, and do not want to be like a god, so I can say with certainty that playing is not an easy thing. There are many amateur opera troupes in Shanghai, and some of them have a long history, but those who can go on stage and arouse the audience's interest are really rare. The few that the Shanghai Epidemic Hospital colleagues Fuyuan Branch invited to perform a charity performance, such as Zhao Jun Peixin, Zhang Jun Zhesheng, Wang Jun Qijun, and Sun Jun Junxiang, can be called the top talents among Shanghai amateur opera singers. I have admired Zhesheng and Qijun several times before. As for Zhao Jun Peixin, I have heard of him for a long time, but I have never heard him sing. A few days ago, I went to the Shenbao newspaper office, and the editor asked me to write about this golden charity performance to fill the entertainment column of Shenbao. I had not played this tune for a long time, so I did not dare to serve at first. But with the strong encouragement of my old friends, I could not refuse the kindness. Although the heat was suffocating, I could still listen to the opera of Zhao Jun Peixin here, which was also a blessing to my ears, so I tried it temporarily.

On the first day, I drove there, but it was a bit late, and the hospital was already full. Fortunately, Sun Jun Lantian gave me a warm reception, so it was not a wasted trip. At that time, the performance of "Beating Yan Song" by Zhang Zhesheng and Wang Qijun was coming to an end. Although I could not see the whole picture, I could still see their proficiency from the bits and pieces. After the end of "Beating Yan Song", after a short break, "Si Lang Visits His Mother" was performed. After a rush of wind, suddenly saw Zhao Jun Peixin, a famous amateur opera singer, who had been famous for a long time, slowly walk out of the stage in the midst of simultaneous electric lights and thunderous cheers. The costume was dignified and luxurious, and the pace was in harmony with the rhythm, which was not different from the professionals. It is difficult to achieve this without in-depth research. The two sentences of the prelude, "The golden well locks the wutong, and a long sigh follows a gust of wind," were clear and charming, winning the applause of the audience. I could not help but applaud him. It was not like the followers who echoed the voice of the audience, but it was indeed pleasing to the ear and to the heart, and it was spontaneous. People said that it had the flavor of Ma Lianliang, but when I listen to opera, I never distinguish its genre. As long as I feel that the charm is charming and makes the audience happy, the art is already superb, so why bother to discuss its genre. With Zhao Jun's accurate and crisp enunciation and the free use of his capital, he can create his own genre, and there is no need to limit himself to Ma. When reading the line "Thinking about it, it is so sad," a kind of depressed and tragic situation of tears following the voice was fully expressed, and the audience praised it endlessly. The Xipi slow beat "Yang Yan Hui sits in the palace courtyard and sighs..." was sung flawlessly. From the second to the sixth beat to the sentence "My mother leads the people to come to the northern barbarians," he won another full house of applause. Several allegros were as fast as carrying beads, and the words were clear, which was really rare. Then Sun Jun Junqing took over and sang "Going Out of the Pass to See Mother." I felt it was too hot, so I failed to hear the end of the song and left. The next day was Zhao Jun Peixin and the famous actress Jin Suqin's "Bao Yun Deng." I was attracted by Peixin's artistic talent, and Jin Suqin had not performed for a long time, so her art should be more advanced. So I drove there again after dinner. When I arrived, "Picking Hua Che" was being performed by Gao Xueqiao, a famous actor of the hospital, who played Gao Chong. His kung fu was indeed good. Then "Shi Lian Deng" was performed. This play is a student play that emphasizes singing and acting. Zhao Jun's shaking board "I heard that the two delicate children killed someone, poured cold water on their heads and embraced ice" was light, clear, vigorous, and the allegro "In the past, there was a lonely bamboo gentleman" was new and charming, and won a lot of applause. Jin Suqin's Erhuang slow beat "Ying is not a slave who does not listen to discipline" was clear, euphemistic, pleasant to the ear. The two of them worked meticulously and were a perfect match. It is commendable that famous actors can have unique art as a career. As for Zhao Jun, who is an amateur opera singer, to have this kind of skill, it is really a sight to behold. Sun Jun Junqing's drum beating in "Beating Cao" was as fast as ten thousand horses galloping, as light as a breeze moving bamboo, and the striking method was infinitely changeable. Those who have not deeply understood the samadhi in this are also unlikely to achieve this. On the third day, Zhao Jun Peixin's "Black Basin Account," I wanted to listen carefully to his anti-Erhuang, but because of the weather, it was sultry and oppressive, so I had to give it up. I am very grateful to Sun Jun Lantian for his sincere hospitality this time.

### Three Sentences Cannot Leave the Main Business

— At Least a Storyteller

Before the war, the most lively place for storytelling venues was only in the Nanshi Yimiao Garden. However, each had its own sales channel. The first venue could not make mistakes. For example, the Chaihang Hall must invite the most well-behaved storyteller. Unless it was the late famous artist Guo Shaomei's late father Cao Anshan and others who were most suitable, it was because the place was full of old listeners who did not seek fancy tricks, but must be economical and practical, naturally, this kind of book could not satisfy their hope. When I first came to Shanghai, I wanted to occupy this place, but unfortunately the movement failed.

When the Shanghai war broke out, the Nanshi storytelling venues closed down one after another, and Chaihang Hall was no exception. To this day, it has not yet recovered, alas!

In the past, the Deliyi Teahouse also had storytelling venues, divided into upstairs and downstairs. The listeners there were mostly idle classes or fashionable people. There were often couples holding hands in and out. They all loved to listen to romantic songs and interesting anecdotes, so the most suitable ones were the storytellers who could both speak and sing, such as Ban Bokang and Xu Yunzhi, who were all the stars of the venue, and could also be full of customers every day like Chaihang Hall. It is strange to say that Deliyi is only a few steps away from Chaihang Hall, but the listeners in the two places are in inverse proportion. If there is a mistake, it is a small matter, it must be two Wutai Mountains, it is really a hair's breadth, a thousand miles away.

Correction To the editor: I have read the article "Remembering the Amateur Singer Zhao Peixin" in the entertainment section of the fifth day, which states that the chairman of our society, Shao Changling, donated 25,000 yuan alone. After investigation, this is not in line with the facts. The money was raised by Shao from relatives and friends, and was not donated by individuals. I am deeply afraid that the outside world does not understand the truth, so please correct it in your column. I am very grateful for your help. Sincerely, Lecheng Peking Opera Society.

### Lang De Shan Takes the Stage Again

Technician Lang Deshan, who previously took the stage at the Great Light Theater, was warmly supported by the audience. Every show, day and night, was full of customers. Because the performance period was limited, there were many who missed it. I have heard that Lang Jun, in order to repay the kindness of his friends, will be performing his stunts with the Xin Wanhua Troupe at the Nanjing Theater again, starting this Sunday. The right picture is a recent portrait of Lang Jun.

### Sailing in the Same Boat

— He Jia Zhi

(Seven) Swift Thunder

The next morning, it was still snowing lightly. At noon, the snow stopped. Mrs. Ye Er said, "The snow can't be said to be bad, it's auspicious snow. It would be better if it fell earlier, if it could fall on the day before New Year's Eve." There were three or four sparrows jumping around on the roof, jumping and looking for food in the snow. Standing in Shide Hall and looking outside, you could see the treetops outside the open space. Of course, there were no leaves. The bare branches were piled with white lines of clouds. A gust of wind blew, and the snow fell down in chunks. The yellow dog dragged its tail and strolled in from outside the gate. It just walked in a straight line, leaving its plum blossom footprints all the way. Cui Zhen saw that the snow had stopped and called Ah Xing to take the iron sickle and dustpan to help Magpie sweep the snow. Wei Cheng stood blankly in the Shuangmei Study and said, "Don't sweep, don't sweep, leave it for a day to see. Tomorrow, wait for the snow to melt a part before sweeping." Cui Zhen didn't understand what he meant, thinking that Wei Cheng had another crazy idea. Mrs. Ye Er said, "Scholars all like snow. His old man, his father, and his uncle all have this idea."

Unexpectedly, by evening, the wind stopped. It started snowing again. Mrs. Ye Er secretly went to see what Wei Cheng was doing. When she looked, he was not in the Shuangmei Study. She walked from inside the house and went around to his bedroom, but he was not in the bedroom either. This was a bit strange. She called out and walked to the Shuangmei Study again. She called out again. Then she discovered that Wei Cheng was in a room inside the Shuangmei Study. Mrs. Ye Er said, "What are you doing?" Wei Cheng said, "I'm not doing anything." Mrs. Ye Er looked inside and saw that there were books and letters spread out on the table, probably writing. Mrs. Ye Er said, "Are you writing a letter?" Wei Cheng said, "Yes." Mrs. Ye Er said, "You can't tell people the words in the will." Wei Cheng said, "Aunt, I know this. Now, only I, aunt, and Sister Cui Zhen know." (149)
