### Re-discussing Thorough Implementation of Consumption Economy

Regarding the points where administrative and business organizations should thoroughly implement consumption economy, I have briefly listed and discussed them yesterday. Now, I would like to offer my humble opinions on the consumption economy of social organizations and individuals, to inform the people of our nation.

(1) Limiting the Types of Goods Sold by Consumer Cooperatives: The goods sold by consumer cooperatives should be limited to daily necessities. Consumables such as candy and cigarettes should be prohibited from being sold.

(2) Using Cooperatives to Implement Quota Distribution: Utilizing cooperative organizations to implement quota distribution based on the number of family members and the actual quantity of goods needed by members.

(3) Promoting the Use of Substitute Goods: For goods that are underproduced, promote the use of other goods as substitutes; for goods that are expensive and scarce, promote the use of goods that are cheap and plentiful (e.g., using soy milk instead of milk); reward the invention of substitute methods and promote them.

(4) Limiting the Transportation, Sale, and Manufacture of Luxury Goods: Prohibit the transportation and sale of luxury goods, restrict the manufacture of luxury goods, and plan to transfer the original manpower and resources used in the production of luxury goods to businesses that produce necessities.

(5) Promoting Public Cooperation: Public cooperative businesses such as barbershops, bathhouses, and laundries should be promoted in quantity to reduce general living expenses.

(6) Promoting Public Dining Halls: Reduce small families cooking separately to save manpower and material consumption.

(7) Restricting the Addition of Entertainment Venues and Restaurants, and Their Business Hours: Night business hours, in particular, should end earlier to reduce unnecessary consumption, and the addition of new ones should be strictly limited.

(8) Saving Electricity: Practice getting up early and going to bed early to reduce electricity consumption.

(9) Reducing Socializing: Minimize extravagance in banquets and gifts for weddings, funerals, and celebrations. Banquet and feast expenses should be limited, with a maximum of three to four hundred yuan per table.

(10) Promoting Simple Clothing and Frugal Eating: Conserve fabric and unnecessary fancy clothing, reduce the consumption of food and other foodstuffs. Finally, from the standpoint of this newspaper, we would also like to briefly mention the following points for cultural enterprises, to encourage ourselves and others:

(1) Reducing the Number of Official Gazettes and Publications of Organizations and Groups: Except for necessary official gazettes and publications, they should be reduced as much as possible.

(2) Limiting the Length of Magazines: Various magazines should limit the number of pages to reduce unnecessary length, improve the quality of writing, and reduce the quantity.

(3) Reducing the Length of Newspapers: Adopt a policy of refined editing, extracting the key points of news, removing the unnecessary and retaining the essential, avoiding duplication of news, reducing advertising space, and saving paper and other consumption. (On this point, this newspaper is currently designing according to this standard.)

### The Contradiction of the Soviet Union Combined with England and America - Editorial of Asahi Shimbun, December 19th

The Greater East Asia War is fused with the European War to establish a new world order. Under the name of upholding democracy, sacrificing other nations, especially Eastern nations, to enrich themselves is a century-old trick of the British and Americans. Against this poisonous Anglo-American worldwide dominance, our Japan-Germany-Italy alliance stands on a moral world view and engages in courageous resistance. Needless to say, this is a decisive life-and-death struggle. Precisely because there is a clear common goal of combat, the alliance between Japan, Germany, and Italy can become a solid unity.

It is not surprising that Britain and the United States are obsessed with a world domination based on a utilitarian world view, but it is a great contradiction that even the Soviet Union has joined the allied side.

The Soviet Union's world view is diametrically opposed to that of Britain and the United States from any perspective. Therefore, we can only say that due to the outbreak of the German-Soviet war, they united as a temporary measure, but in reality, there is nothing in common to speak of. The Soviet Union and Anglo-American imperialism are fundamentally incompatible. It is a well-known fact that Soviet leaders refer to the British and American leaders as "agents of big capital." Therefore, it is not difficult to imagine that these agents of big capital harbor political, ideological, and even national, as well as latent, hatred and aversion towards the Soviet Union. As a result, the United Nations group, which contains these contradictions, will inevitably develop flaws, and indeed, flaws and cracks have already appeared.

The inconsistencies in combat between the two sides, which are exposed from time to time, stem from mutual distrust and suspicion. As a recent example, on October 4th, Stalin expressed dissatisfaction with Anglo-American aid to the Soviet Union and questioned the Anglo-American opening of a second front. It is worth noting that Anglo-American rhetoric vigorously refuted this question, unintentionally revealing the unpleasantness of their feelings towards the Soviet Union. This suggests that the true intentions of the Anglo-American leadership towards the Soviet Union cannot be concealed. Furthermore, the withdrawal of Cripps from the British War Cabinet at the end of November is also closely related to British-Soviet relations. During February of this year, Britain was repeatedly defeated and overwhelmed, and had no choice but to place the responsibility for prosecuting the war entirely on the Soviet Union. Therefore, Churchill desperately suppressed his inner aversion and brought the pro-Soviet left-wing stalwart Cripps into the cabinet in order to cater to the Soviet Union's intentions as much as possible. However, the manipulation involved is likely to explode at any time. In the recent North African campaign, from Churchill's subjective point of view, he believed that the situation was improving for the British side, and thus his confidence in prosecuting the war has somewhat recovered. As a result, Britain removed its mask and drove away the leftist Cripps. To put it bluntly, Britain has utilized the Soviet Union enough. Not only that, but the Soviet Union has consumed a considerable amount of its strength in the past two years of war against Germany and no longer has the decisive ability to counterattack. Seeing this, they pushed Cripps back to the second line.

Understanding this, we can discern the essence of Britain's relationship with the Soviet Union. How cunning, selfish, and self-serving is Britain's habitual foreign policy.

Secondly, we must be careful of the American and British scheme to alienate Japan and the Soviet Union. As everyone knows, the United States and Britain have consistently used first-rate propaganda to continuously provoke Japan and the Soviet Union, wanting to ignite a fire between the two countries. The United States and Britain have not only used the Soviet Union enough in the war against Germany, but they also want to instigate a Japanese-Soviet conflagration, thereby making the Soviet Union bear a greater sacrifice; this can truly be said to be an extremely cruel ploy.

The attitude and policy of Britain and the United States towards the Soviet Union are as malicious as described above. In the future, due to minor shifts in the situation, the Soviet Union will receive treacherous treatment from Britain and the United States, which goes without saying. It is foolish to talk about treachery with those who do not value good faith. Correctly grasping the true intentions of Britain and the United States is the Soviet Union's top priority.

### Axis Reinforcements Land in North Africa Successively Along the Coast; Allied Forces Launch Offensives on Three Routes, Thwarted by Heavy Attacks from German Air Force

Lisbon, 24th (Central News Agency) - According to comprehensive news from the Tunisian front received here, Axis forces have been landing an average of one thousand troops daily on the Tunisian coast, continuously reinforcing tanks and armored vehicles. Among them, the tank units, which have accumulated rich experience on the Maginot Line, can be considered the most elite. According to a dispatch from the frontline correspondent of the British Broadcasting Corporation, General Eisenhower, the commander-in-chief of the anti-Axis forces, is currently deploying Anderson's British First Army on the left flank, American troops in the center, and Free French forces on the right flank to launch an offensive against the Axis forces. However, this plan seems to have been thwarted as a result of the Axis air force heavily bombing their supply lines.

Bern, Switzerland, 23rd (Havas) - According to a Berlin dispatch, naval battles between the Axis and Allied navies are taking place near the eastern coast of Algiers in North Africa. When a squadron of Allied warships was escorting several transport ships towards Bougie, they were spotted by a group of Axis reconnaissance planes. Immediately, more planes were dispatched to drop bombs and submarines fired torpedoes to attack them. A total of two 15,000-ton transport ships were hit, and one British and one American submarine were sunk by our destroyers. In addition, we shot down five British planes and heavily damaged one of their destroyers. Moreover, as of the time of dispatch, the naval battles were still ongoing.

Berlin, 24th (DNB) - The Libyan front remained very quiet yesterday. The vanguard of the British Eighth Army is currently following the Axis forces with extreme caution, advancing slowly. British engineering corps are clearing mines in the desert and along the coast, which are the biggest obstacles to the British advance. On the Tunisian front, a squadron of French cavalry participating in the British and American operations was completely annihilated by German forces at Pont du Fahs. The French suffered the loss of forty warhorses, one hundred killed, and countless captured war materials. German bomber squadrons are currently heavily bombing British supply lines. This week, the Axis air force has sunk a total of 49,000 tons of British and American ships off the coast of Algiers.

Rome, 23rd (Havas) - According to North African news, British troops launched repeated attacks in the Sirt area of Tripolitania yesterday, all of which were repelled. In Tunisia, several teams of British and American troops were annihilated by Italian forces. The Italian and German air forces are effectively coordinated, sparing no effort in bombing railway facilities and transportation centers in Tunisia and eastern Algeria. The port of Bone in Algeria has also been subjected to large-scale bombing.

Rumors that Britain and the United States are using the former Spanish Prime Minister to covet Spanish Morocco in North Africa

According to a dispatch from Algiers on the 23rd, the American military has intended to organize international troops with members of the disbanded Spanish Communist Party or Popular Front when American troops invaded French North Africa.

### Rumor that Spanish President Franco will visit Portugal to return the visit and discuss future cooperation strategies for the Iberian bloc

Stockholm, Sweden, 24th (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from the Stockholm correspondent in Lisbon, it is rumored that Spanish President Franco will soon visit Portugal to hold talks with Portuguese government leaders. It is said that the purpose of the talks is to discuss future cooperation strategies for the recently established Iberian bloc and exchange opinions.

Lisbon, 24th (Rengo) - "Diário de Notícias" commented yesterday on the visit of Spanish Foreign Minister Jordana to Lisbon, stating that the Spanish-Portuguese bloc has become an important factor in Europe. Spain and Portugal are united for peace and are not intended to oppose anyone. The official government newspaper "Maha" stated that Jordana's visit has furthered the understanding and determination to maintain peace in the Iberian Peninsula. Spain and Portugal currently maintain valuable strength as a preparation for future construction. "Novidades" stated that Portugal's every action is purely for self-defense, and that the country not only opposes the Communist Party but is also prepared to resist anyone who infringes upon Portugal's independence.

### A Tour of the Forefront in North China (Dialogue) (4)

Member of the House of Representatives: Kunikatsu Tsugumo Secretary-General of the House of Representatives: Osamu Oki

Translated from the December issue of "Gendai" in Showa 31 (1942)

Soldiers Fighting on the Forefront

Reporter: So, please change the topic here and talk about the situation of the Japanese army at the frontline bases or the forefront positions, what is it like?

Tsugumo: This is the most important thing. I visited the forefront of Yuncheng in Shanxi Province. Mr. Oki, you crossed the Yellow River from Baotou to the forefront of Olteus, right?

Oki: I took a night train in Datong on September 24, wrapped in a blanket, and arrived in Baotou on the 25th. From here, I crossed the Yellow River, and 20 kilometers ahead in the Olteus Plain, the so-called communist army was rampant, and the Japanese army had its first line of defense there. The width of the Yellow River is about 200 meters in this area. Supported by engineers, and with guards following before and after, our group arrived at the location where the frontline troops were stationed. There were only five or six mud-brick houses, surrounded by earthen walls, and it was questionable whether they could keep out the cold. The Japanese soldiers were guarding day and night with guns in such places. Not long before we went to comfort them, bandits had launched a night attack near these earthen walls. The bandits had machine guns and were quite powerful. The Japanese army quickly responded and repelled them, but unfortunately, several soldiers, including a lieutenant, were killed. The soldiers of the same team built their tombstones on the side of the barracks and sincerely prayed for their souls. Because bandits appear and disappear unpredictably in the darkness, they said that they could not let their guard down for even a minute. I had comforted the forefront in Central China in the spring of the year before last, and this time I experienced everything at the forefront again, fully appreciating the hardships of the soldiers, and feeling that the people must express their heartfelt gratitude to them. This is a desolate village, and only a delegation of members of the House of Representatives had crossed the Yellow River to visit it once two or three years ago. Since the incident, it was the first time that the Speaker of the House of Representatives had comforted the forefront in North China and Mengjiang, and especially visited such a desolate place, and the soldiers were very grateful.

Tsugumo: I departed from Datong for Taiyuan at night. Since it wasn't a train with berths, I had to borrow a blanket from the army and spend the night wrapped in it. When we reached the area of Shuozhou, it was just dawn, and the train gradually approached the mountains. Soon, the train rushed forward between mountains of about 10,000 feet high. Looking out the window, there was a fortress on every highest mountain peak, with the Rising Sun flag fluttering on it, and under it stood a soldier holding a gun, protecting the train and the tracks we were riding on in the wind carrying sand. We felt very grateful. Everyone in the group was moved to tears. The frontline I saw was in the southern end of Shanxi Province, near Yuncheng, which is the producing area of Hedong salt. Riding in a freight car along the famous salt pond, it took three hours to cross the rugged Zhongtiao Mountains from Yuncheng. After comforting the troops stationed there, we spent the night there. The next morning, we rode horses through roads that cars could not pass, and after more than an hour, we arrived at the position of the troops stationed in the forefront village on the bank of the Yellow River. At this time, we happened to be in the middle of a battle, with the enemy using machine guns and our side responding with mountain artillery.

Condolences to Konoe

Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency) - President Wang Jingwei of the National Government, concurrently holding the position of President of the Executive Yuan, has been very busy with banquets since his arrival in Japan. At 10:10 this morning, he specially spared time to visit Duke Fumimaro Konoe, who is hospitalized in the hospital attached to the Imperial University. Duke Konoe has been in the hospital for treatment since mid-October this year, and his condition has been very good. Today, he was dressed in formal attire and first went to the council chamber on the second floor of the Yasuda Auditorium of the Imperial University to wait. Before long, President Wang Jingwei, accompanied by Vice Minister Zhou of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Secretary Shimizu of the Ministry of Greater East Asia of Japan, arrived. The two had not seen each other for a long time and were deeply pleased. After exchanging greetings and taking seats, except for Zhou and Shimizu, all others were dismissed and they held a cordial conversation. President Wang Jingwei resolutely left Chongqing on December 22, 1938, to advocate for peace in order to seek the peace and revival of China, while Duke Konoe also issued the Konoe Statement to seek mutual cooperation between China and Japan to build a new order in Greater East Asia. The two had pledged to work for the peace of the two countries. During the conversation, they recalled the past and were filled with emotion. Looking to the future, they were filled with infinite hope. The conversation ended at 10:40. When President Wang Jingwei took his leave, Duke Konoe declined to see him off due to his illness and watched President Wang Jingwei leave by car from the window.

Condolences to Miyazaki

Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency) - Ms. Tsuruko Miyazaki, the widow of the late famous Miyazaki Toten, passed away due to illness on the 23rd. President Wang Jingwei of the National Government, concurrently holding the position of President of the Executive Yuan, had a long-standing friendship with Mr. Miyazaki, so he sent Foreign Minister Chu as his representative today to pay condolences at the Miyazaki residence and present a generous condolence gift. After the Russo-Japanese War, Mr. Miyazaki assisted National Father Sun Yat-sen and revolutionary martyrs Huang Xing and others in establishing the headquarters of the Chinese Revolutionary Alliance in Tokyo.

### Japanese Foreign Minister and Minister of Greater East Asia Host Banquet for President Wang Jingwei, Exchange Views on General Issues After Banquet

Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency) - A dinner party jointly hosted by the Japanese Foreign Minister and the Minister of Greater East Asia to bid farewell to President Wang Jingwei, concurrently holding the position of President of the Executive Yuan, was held at the official residence of the Foreign Minister in Kojimachi tonight. The guests of honor were President Wang Jingwei, Foreign Minister Chu, Finance Minister Zhou, Chairman Xiao of the Military Advisory Council, Minister of Industry Mei, and Minister of Propaganda Lin. The accompanying guests were Ambassador Xu Liang and counselors of the embassy, Ambassador Shigemitsu to China, Counselor Nakamura, advisors Ishiwatari, Matsui, and Teraoka of the National Government, Director-General Matsudaira, General Abe, and special envoys Hiruma, Arita, and Nagai who visited the National Government, Ambassador Hidaka to Italy, and Director Okumura of the Information Bureau. During the dinner, Foreign Minister Tani gave a welcoming speech first and raised a glass to the health of President Wang Jingwei and his entourage. President Wang Jingwei then gave a reply, expressing China's firm determination to advance together with its ally Japan in the spirit of sharing life and death. After the banquet, they exchanged views on general issues in another room. The welcoming speech of Foreign Minister Tani and the reply of President Wang Jingwei are recorded below:

Welcoming Speech by Foreign Minister Tani

In his welcoming speech, Foreign Minister Tani recalled that it has been four years since President Wang Jingwei advocated for the peace movement, and it has also been over two years since the signing of the Basic Relations Treaty between China and Japan. During this time, the internal and external situations have been extremely difficult, but under the leadership of President Wang Jingwei, the National Government has laid the foundation for revival, and all constructions are progressing rapidly. We have always admired President Wang Jingwei's efforts. After Japan declared war on Britain and the United States on December 8 last year, President Wang Jingwei further expressed his determination to share weal and woe with Japan. In May of this year, he specially dispatched Special Envoy Chu and his entourage to visit our country to seek close cooperation. Japan also sent Special Envoys Hiruma, Arita, and Nagai to China to return the visit. Today, the cooperation between China and Japan has reached a perfect state, which is truly cause for celebration. However, the cooperation between the two countries is not only for temporary interests, but, as stated in the Basic Relations Treaty between China and Japan, it is based on the common ideal of building a new order and has the characteristics of spiritual unity. Now the war has entered its second year in the midst of successive victories, and Japan has decided to exert all its strength to complete this unprecedented war. This can be told to our ally. Furthermore, President Wang Jingwei's visit to our country this time has strengthened our determination to fight.

President Wang Jingwei's Reply

President Wang Jingwei replied as follows: Since I and my colleagues in the National Government arrived in Tokyo, we have been delighted to meet Foreign Minister Tani and Minister of Greater East Asia Aoki, and it is difficult to express in words. Tonight, we are even more honored to be invited to a banquet. Your Excellency Tani is highly talented and highly respected. I had the honor of seeing you more than ten years ago. Today, I am overjoyed to meet you again and to hear about your great ambitions and far-reaching insights on the world situation and the East Asian situation. I am filled with admiration. Your Excellency Minister Aoki has worked in Nanjing for more than two years and has spared no effort in seeking the realization of Greater East Asian co-prosperity through Chinese-Japanese cooperation. He has a wealth of knowledge and makes precise observations of the current situation in our country. He is able to discern all advantages and disadvantages. It is truly gratifying for patriots in both countries that he has been appointed to the important position of Minister of Greater East Asia to implement his plans. Today's situation, as stated by Prime Minister Tojo yesterday, is a historically defining era for the world. Internally, it instructs the East Asian nations to advance as East Asian comrades in the construction of co-prosperity, and externally, it responds to the myriad changes in the world with an unchanging East Asian axis, overcoming the shackles of Britain and the United States for a hundred years and promoting the moral spirit of the East for thousands of years. It is truly joyful and encouraging that Your Excellencies Tani and Aoki are assuming important responsibilities in this great era to complete this great mission. In the past four years, I have been running around for peace and deeply feel that the word peace does not mean passive appeasement, but rather the active establishment of a foundation for friendship between China and Japan. Therefore, based on my country's National Father Sun Yat-sen's Greater Asianism, I responded to your country's advocacy of building a new order in East Asia. Since your country launched the Greater East Asia War, the National Government immediately declared its determination to share weal and woe, which is based on the above-mentioned meaning and further engages in a struggle of sharing security and sharing life and death. However, I am deeply concerned that my efforts are limited and will not be of much help. This visit has given me the opportunity to have sincere talks with officials, and I have received encouragement and assistance. In addition to being grateful, I can only rely on my efforts and work harder to live up to expectations. With this intention, I would like to use the host's glass to wish Your Excellencies Tani and Aoki good health and to wish for the increase of friendship between our two countries and the success of the construction of Greater East Asian co-prosperity.

### National Government Adjusts Military Structure; Ministry of Army and Navy Reassigned to Military Commission, Personally Commanded by Chairman Wang

Nanjing, 24th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the National Government, with the spirit of sharing weal and woe, has been exerting its full strength in all aspects to cooperate with Japan in order to complete the Greater East Asia War. As a result, the relationship between China and Japan has become even closer. In order to cope with the current situation and strive to strengthen its military power, the National Government authorities have successively adjusted the central military structure and reassigned the Ministry of Army and Navy, which were subordinate to the administration, directly under the jurisdiction of the Military Commission. Chairman Wang will personally command them in order to unify the army's organization, equipment, and training. The government also plans to retrain the reorganized troops in various regions. It is expected that the fundamental policy of the National Government in reorganizing the army in the future will be: (1) to massively equip the army with military supplies and weapons; (2) to implement the principle of elite troops to reorganize the army; (3) to strengthen the local military and police forces; (4) to increase military pay; (5) to establish military spirit; (6) to establish military administration; and (7) to establish a foundation for military expenditure. Among them, the preparation of military supplies and weapons will be actively carried out in the future in order to exert the strength of the National Government's army. At the same time, the reorganization of the army will also adopt the principle of elite troops, resolutely reorganize personnel, and eliminate the old warlord characteristics. In order to respond to the construction of a new China, the government will begin to form new and sharp troops. Therefore, military pay will inevitably be increased. Once the military spirit is injected, the National Government's military construction will surely make a leap forward. The establishment of local security has become increasingly important among the important issues of the National Government today. Therefore, strengthening the local military and police forces is an urgent task at present. Therefore, it will also be rapidly carried out in the near future. The specific implementation methods are expected to increase the number of local armed police and security teams, and retrain and reorganize the troops in order to consolidate local security and ensure that military and political forces can be integrated internally and externally to vigorously expand the peaceful areas. Therefore, under this Greater East Asia War, the strengthening of the National Government's military power is quite promising in cooperating with the Greater East Asia War.

### British Deeply Fear German Attack on Gibraltar; Rumor That Axis Forces Have Shifted Target from Eastern Front to Southwestern Europe

Stockholm, Swedish Capital, 24th (Haitong News Agency Dispatch) - According to Swedish newspapers citing London news, the British fear of a German attack on Gibraltar is increasing. The London correspondent of "Swedish Evening News" said that the movements of neutral European countries have become the focus of British discussion. According to British news, the border blockade between Fascist countries and Switzerland has lasted for several days, which is enough to prove that German forces have concentrated considerable military strength there. London's "Daily Mail" said that the Axis powers have shifted their joint military strength from the Eastern Front to Southwestern Europe. Germany's target is Gibraltar, no longer Stalingrad.

### Eating and Loans; Students Appeal to Public Opinion; Hoping for Fairness and Simplicity

Last time I briefly reported on the inside story of inland student loans. Here is another letter from a student appealing to the public. I have specially excerpted it below:

"Today there is only one class in the afternoon on the timetable. What good deeds can I do? Most of my classmates have gone to class. The dormitory is deserted and I can't find anyone to chat with. This kind of dead air is enough to suffocate people.

My eyes occasionally fell on the bright words "Thirteen" hanging on the wall - such an unpleasant and ominous day - which startled me deeply. The meal fees I paid are only enough for two days of meals. What should I do? If I don't think of a way immediately, I may be in danger of starvation the day after tomorrow. The letter I wrote to my brother for help half a month ago has not yet been answered. I don't know whether the loan I applied for a long time ago will be approved. Old Xu seemed to have a registered letter yesterday. If the money is remitted, I can make do with it. Old Li has a lot of money, but he is reluctant to lend it to others. It is better not to be snubbed. Old Wang's money has already been borrowed by those who were quicker. There is no way to think of it from him. It is just the beginning of the semester and I am already poor. How can I get through this semester?

I lay blankly on the bed. The verdant pine trees outside the window sighed softly with the breeze. The milky sky leaking through the gaps in the branches always looked so mournful. The early ripe peaches of the South that I picked in the wild suburbs the day before yesterday also looked very haggard. A few decaying dead petals fell weakly on the table. I whistled softly, trying to drive away this oppressive air. But the shadows of "meal fees" and "eating"... were reflected even more strongly and clearly in my mind.

Suddenly, the door was pushed open and Old Xu walked in, looking very unhappy:

"It's too unreasonable!"

"What's the matter?" I asked, sitting up from the bed.

"The results of the loan review have been announced. Damn it, I'm still just self-funded B!"

"What about me? What about me? Did you see it?"

"You are self-funded A?"

A ray of light swept back into my eyes. Meal fees and eating problems were all solved. After all, there is no way out. Everything in the room seemed to be smiling at me. All the cells in my body suddenly felt an unusual ease and joy, making my body seem to have endless heat. I stood up happily and really wanted to laugh heartily.

But when I saw Xu Jun's cold face, I thought I should comfort this disappointed friend.

"It doesn't matter! Self-funded B is also good. There are still those who have not been approved!"

"Hmph! I don't know what the loan committee is based on to review. Li ×× is actually a war zone A."

"What? He is war zone A? Isn't he very well-off? Yesterday I saw him stewing meat in the dormitory. This morning he was still boasting about his leather shoes that cost one hundred yuan a pair. Why can he get a war zone student loan?"

"Don't you know? His loan applicant is the dean! At this time, everything is a "face issue." The dean applies on his behalf, so there is no reason not to approve it." He said angrily.

"..."

"The loan committee is based on whether there is a certificate of poverty and the "face" of your applicant to review. But the more truly poor you are, the harder it is to get a certificate of poverty. I don't have a popular person in the county government in my hometown. I still can't get this certificate of poverty today. I have submitted two or three petitions, but no one pays attention to you! When the loan was about to be verified, I asked Huang, the squadron leader of our dormitory, to be the applicant. I meant that because he was relatively close to us, the school would certainly believe that he could know our real situation. Who knew that he had no "face" in the school, so I got a self-funded B. Those who asked professors to apply were at least self-funded A. As for the dean, his "face" is even bigger, so of course he got a war zone loan."

"..."

"Damn it! Based on this suit of clothes, see if I should be approved for type A."

People are somewhat selfish and self-interested. Although I heard so many of his unfair complaints, I was still secretly rejoicing that my personal problem was solved. I unconsciously said:

"Who cares, I don't have to worry about my eating problem the day after tomorrow!"...

"Don't be happy, this is just approval. The day to issue money is still far away!"

"What?!"

"The school has to submit the list of approved loan students to the Ministry of Education. The Ministry of Education will approve the amount of our monthly meal fees, and then the money will be sent down from Chongqing. It will take at least two months."

"You received a registered letter yesterday. Can you lend me some money? I won't have any food to eat the day after tomorrow!"

"I'm also worried. What came yesterday was a package."

I was stunned. This time I was plunged into the deep pool of cold water again.

Preparing to Ration Cooking Oil Based on Population

A Central News Agency reporter learned from the wholesale department yesterday that the department's method of rationing and selling cooking oil is still effective. However, in order to prevent citizens from hoarding, selling for profit, and cooking oil stores from deducting sales, the department has decided to implement a method of rationing cooking oil based on population in the future and is currently preparing for it. The previous regulation of selling oil based on house donation tickets was abolished because it was feared that it would cause major malpractices. At the same time, according to the person in charge of the department, the source of cooking oil in the city has recently become increasingly abundant. The amount of oil shipped from Dalian and other places to Shanghai is estimated to be tens of thousands of dan.

List of Oil Shops Selling Oil Today

Today is the last day for Group A oil shops in the two concessions and the urban area to sell cooking oil (a total of four days).

### Outline of Investigation of Financial Institutions; Promulgated and Ordered to Fill Out and Report by Various Banks and Firms Within a Time Limit

The Financial Examination Department of the Central Reserve Bank has begun to review the monthly financial statements of various banks, money shops, and trust companies since September of this year. The payment deposit reserve of each bank, shop, and company has also been verified and deposited into the Central Reserve Bank and opened an account since September. It is learned that in order to understand the business conditions of various financial institutions and to implement inspections, the department specially issued a form of names and important items of various financial institutions yesterday, and sent a letter to each bank, money shop, and trust company, limiting the time to fill out and report, including (1) name, location of headquarters and branches, (2) month and year of organization and establishment, month and year of registration, license number, (3) total capital, paid-in capital, (4) address and telephone number, (5) business scope, (6) names of investors or directors and supervisors, (7) names and addresses of representatives and important employees.

### 27th Anniversary of Yunnan Uprising; Various Circles Commemorate

Today is the 27th anniversary of the Yunnan Uprising. The municipal government has scheduled a commemorative ceremony to be held at 10:00 a.m. today in the city hall auditorium. Banks, money shops, public organizations, and markets in the city are closed for one day as usual. The police authorities in the two concessions and the city areas of southwest Shanghai, Zhabei, and Pudong have temporarily been on alert for one day to prevent disturbances and maintain social order.

### Raw Silk Shipped to North; In Accordance with Previous Asia Development Board Resolution; To Be Shipped Out Before Next March

The Central China and North Liaison Department of the former Asia Development Board held a meeting in Beijing at the end of August of this year to determine the quantity of raw silk and silk fabrics transported and sold from Central China to North China and Mengjiang. It is heard that a large batch of raw silk has recently been transported. The remaining part will be shipped out before next March.

### New Valuation of Real Estate in Public Concession Temporarily Not Implemented

The Information Office of the Public Works Department announced that the bureau had previously set up a committee to investigate tax inequality. The report made by the committee, which was resolved by a majority of members, was sent by the bureau to the annual meeting of foreign taxpayers on April 17 of last year for approval. The bureau, in accordance with the annual meeting resolution, considered the implementation of the recommendations in the report. Although the real estate located in the Public Concession has been revalued, the bureau, in view of the current situation, has no intention of implementing this new valuation for the time being.

### Reader Forum

In general, political, economic, social, cultural, and educational issues related to people's lives should be of deep concern to the authorities, and the most reasonable policy guidelines should be formulated accordingly. At the same time, the authorities must also be able to accept the continuous contributions of opinions from the people and make revisions to adapt to the environment. This newspaper takes the standpoint of the people and fulfills its responsibility to public opinion, and naturally takes it as its responsibility to communicate the opinions between the authorities and the people. Therefore, we have opened a reader forum to publicly introduce the good-faith and truthful opinions of the people. We hope that readers will pay attention and that a small reward will be given for any contributions that are published.

### The Crisis in Shanghai's Education Sector

— Jiang Feng

Shanghai, as the largest city in the country, holds a pivotal position in the development of education at all levels, from primary to tertiary. Although the sheer number of institutions might lead to uneven quality, their efforts in nurturing talent and elevating culture are largely commendable. In recent years, amid turbulent times and global unrest, the sounds of learning have scarcely ceased in Shanghai. This is partly due to the local authorities' dedicated support, and partly due to the education personnel's strenuous self-reliance. However, as living conditions become increasingly difficult, I deeply feel that the future of education is fraught with difficulties. In essence, these can be summarized into four points:

1.  The Drastic Increase in Educational Expenses: Shanghai is teeming with schools, with public schools in the minority and private schools accounting for the majority. Private schools, when registering, were originally required to establish a designated fund. However, most only went through the motions to satisfy formalities and lacked actual funds. Those with assets were often controlled by individuals, leading to numerous disputes. Others may have possessed real estate, but could not utilize it since the war, thus increasing their burden. As a result, all expenses depend heavily on tuition fees. Consequently, tuition fees have repeatedly increased. At the primary level, tuition commonly reaches one hundred or even one hundred fifty to sixty yuan per semester. At the secondary level, it ranges from one hundred several tens to two hundred several tens yuan. Universities charge over three hundred yuan. And this does not include the cost of books and stationery, which can easily amount to fifty to sixty yuan for primary school, over one hundred yuan for secondary school, and even several hundred yuan for university students. Furthermore, some schools have the bizarre practice of charging separately for examination paper. For students whose schools are far from home, transportation and meal expenses are not even factored in. While the affluent may not find these costs significant, how will the impoverished cope?

2.  The Emptiness of Educational Facilities: Modern education cannot simply rely on teachers to fulfill their duties by lecturing from textbooks and notes. This is particularly true for secondary schools and universities, where reference books and experimental equipment and materials are essential. Since the war, however, most schools have lost their original library facilities. Any supplementation has been minimal. Newly established schools are even more devoid of resources. It is true that schools face financial difficulties, but some officials may be using this as an excuse to enrich themselves privately. In the past year, the cost of experimental materials has risen even higher, leading some laboratories to close down. Teachers struggle with the inconvenience of finding supporting materials, and students find it even more difficult to understand the lessons. Among young people, diligent learners can still catch a glimpse of the subject matter, while mediocre ones can simply go through the motions. The cost of education is rising daily, while the standards are declining. Is this not a cause for concern?

3.  The Chaos in the Education System: China's education system had just begun to take shape before the war, though not yet perfect, it was fixed and systematic. In recent years, however, malpractice has become a cause for concern. First, there is no standard for selecting subjects, with secondary schools either emphasizing science over humanities or discarding history and geography. Universities often cancel required courses due to low enrollment, arbitrarily substituting them with other classes. All of these are clearly wrong. Second, the flexibility of time affects work schedules, with class hours and term start and end dates being freely adjusted, often giving rise to a suspicion of cutting corners. In the past, schools traditionally closed during extreme cold and heat to allow for rest and relaxation, which was scheduled at a fixed time. Now, summer school has become commonplace, with some schools dividing the year into three terms and holding classes in the summer as usual. While school authorities can collect more tuition fees and generate additional revenue, teachers and students end up attending classes in the sweltering heat, engaging in futile talk. Third, the auditing of academic records has lost its basis. In recent years, some schools that fail to self-regulate either indiscriminately enroll students, allowing them to skip grades, or sell fake diplomas, allowing them to advance in their studies. This is the biggest problem in Shanghai's education sector today.

4.  The Poverty of Educational Personnel: Before the war, private university teachers could earn two to three hundred yuan per month, secondary school teachers one to two hundred yuan, and primary school teachers at least thirty to forty yuan. Today, prices have increased by approximately twenty times or more, with rice prices exceeding even that multiple. Moreover, rice, which was once an insignificant expense, now accounts for half of the household budget. Yet, teachers' salaries have increased by only four to five times at most, and sometimes less than three times compared to pre-war levels. Most teachers come from humble backgrounds. Only a few female teachers without family responsibilities can barely make ends meet. Ordinary teachers use their savings accumulated from hard work to make up for the shortfall, but this cannot be sustained for long. Selling or pawning possessions is ultimately limited. As a result, they must cut costs in every possible way, even to the point of malnutrition and avoiding medical treatment. On the other hand, they must take on more work to make ends meet. It is common for university teachers to teach up to thirty hours, secondary school teachers forty hours, and primary school teachers to tutor in two or three private homes. Despite such strenuous labor, their income often falls short of half of their expenses. They may feel relatively satisfied at the beginning of a semester, but by the end, they are far from making ends meet. Furthermore, one's energy is limited. Rushing about, speaking until hoarse, erudite scholars can barely cope, while mediocre ones inevitably cut corners. Even worse, they may be used in areas where they lack expertise, resulting in wasted effort. How can we expect to improve the quality of education?

The above are all very serious symptoms in Shanghai's education sector. Thorough reform will not be easy. However, if such a situation is not remedied urgently, Shanghai's education may not only go bankrupt but also lose its effectiveness. In recent days, various public opinions have repeatedly discussed this issue, but specific solutions do not seem comprehensive. I now propose a few more points below:

(1) Regarding Improving Teachers' Remuneration

(A) Increase the Amount of Various Rations: The difficulties faced by teachers stem from the insufficient quantity of rations such as rice, flour, oil, and sugar. This shortage disproportionately affects teachers whose monthly salaries are fixed and have barely increased. They must either supplement their rations through the black market, which is costly, or, since teachers and their families cannot easily purchase goods themselves, they are often unable to afford domestic help. Therefore, until rations can universally meet everyone's needs, subsidies should be provided to teachers based on the number of their direct relatives who live with them and are unemployed. The amount of subsidies for primary, secondary, and university teachers may be differentiated. University teachers, with their higher qualifications and smaller numbers, can be given slightly more preferential treatment, while subsidies for primary school teachers, who are more numerous, can be slightly reduced. Those who teach at multiple schools, as well as couples who are both teachers, should not receive multiple rations. Those who already receive additional allowances at schools such as those run by the Municipal Council should also be subject to separate restrictions. The methods of supervision and other details should be determined separately. However, teachers should still pay the officially set price for rations, so that teachers do not starve and the authorities are not burdened excessively.

(B) Reduce Tuition Fees for Teachers' Children: Teachers live a meager life, and there is a risk that their children may not be able to attend school. Following the example of doctors providing free medical care to their relatives, all schools should offer half-price or free tuition for teachers' children. This is a method of mutual assistance within the education sector, and I hope that schools will take the initiative to implement it as soon as possible!

(2) Regarding Subsidizing and Enhancing Facilities

(A) Various books, especially textbooks, should be fully equipped. The authorities should encourage bookstores to offer special discounts to schools that purchase books.

(B) Schools should also be urged to make full use of existing equipment and instruments. For deficiencies, efforts should be made to have merchants offer special discounts. The same should be done for needed materials. If the cost of water, electricity, and gas can be reduced, it would be particularly beneficial, so that schools do not have to grope in the dark during classes in the morning and evening, and that experiments are not just nominal but actually meaningful. In addition, if jointly used laboratories can be set up in different districts and borrowed in rotation, it would be even more beneficial to scientific education.

(3) Regarding Rectifying the Education System

Shanghai's educational administration has been neglected for a long time and urgently needs rectification. The focus of rectification should be on the management of curriculum, academic records, and other items. First, everything should be run entirely by Chinese personnel to avoid misunderstandings. Second, it should be handled by formal institutions, but must be promoted by qualified personnel with appropriate qualifications.

If these measures can be implemented, tuition fees will not increase excessively with rising prices. The quality of facilities can be improved. Teachers' lives will also be stabilized. It is hoped that all relevant authorities and responsible personnel from various schools can cooperate to achieve the desired results, so that Shanghai's education will not only overcome the difficulties but also regain its former glory!

### Cooperative Plans to Distribute Sugar Based on Population, Starting with a Pilot Program in Nanshi; Police to Inspect Those Carrying Four or More Small Packages of Sugar

In order to ensure a steady supply of sugar to the Shanghai market, the Shanghai Sugar Merchants Cooperative Business Office, in addition to allocating sugar according to market demand, has submitted a proposal to the authorities to implement sugar distribution based on population, to popularize sugar distribution and prevent merchants from profiting. The implementation will be announced after approval, and a pilot program is planned to be launched in Nanshi first. After achieving results, it will be extended to the entire city. The sugar distribution plan will be based on the population registered in each district's baojia (neighborhood watch) system.

Important Notice for Carrying Sugar

Before the population-based sugar distribution is implemented, temporary measures will be used to issue sugar based on housing tax receipts and household registration. These temporary measures have been improved as much as possible to prevent fraud. Anyone holding a housing tax receipt to purchase sugar must bring their citizen identification card with matching address. At the same time, police stations in each district have instructed police officers to pay attention to anyone carrying four or more small packages of sugar and must check their housing tax receipts before allowing them to pass, in order to prevent merchants from reselling for profit.

Supervise Sales

The sugar will be sold by Category A retailers that have been registered and approved. In the Public and French Concessions, sugar will be distributed based on housing tax receipts and citizen identification cards, while in Zhabei and West Shanghai, it will be distributed based on household registration. To strictly supervise and prevent fraud, supervisors and inspectors have been ordered to closely monitor the process. Supervisors will be stationed at retailers issuing sugar based on housing tax receipts to supervise sales. Inspectors will review all relevant books and records of retailers issuing sugar based on citizen identification cards after the sales. For industries that require special allocations of sugar, checks will be made at any time to ensure that the sugar is used entirely for business purposes. If any fraudulent activity is discovered, the allocation will be suspended and the matter will be investigated.

### District Court Procuratorate Installs Reporting Bell

The Shanghai District Court Procuratorate has specially installed a reporting bell to effectively protect the legal rights of the people and implement verbal complaints. Rules for public use have been established and approved by the Ministry of Judicial Administration and will be implemented. The implementation measures are detailed below.

Installation

The installation of the reporting bell is intended to facilitate verbal complaints by the public, with the aim of redressing grievances. The regulations stipulate that it applies to criminal cases in which someone wishes to make a verbal complaint or surrender themselves to the authorities. The bell is installed at the front of the court and is managed by the judicial police on duty at the gate. The chief prosecutor of the procuratorate has strictly warned all judicial police not to make things difficult for people, so as not to defeat the purpose of the bell.

Ringing the Bell

Any citizen wishing to make a verbal complaint, report an offense, or surrender themselves should ring the bell and wait quietly at the bell-ringing location under the direction of the judicial police on duty. The judicial police will lead them into the courtroom and they must not leave without permission. The duty prosecutor on call should immediately go to the courtroom with a clerk to conduct the hearing. The clerk will take detailed notes. However, all complainants or informants must not make false accusations based on personal grudges. Once investigated, they will be punished according to the law.

Rules

There are a total of nine rules regarding the use of the reporting bell, which have been submitted by the court procuratorate and approved by the Ministry of Judicial Administration and will be implemented from today. Yesterday, the procuratorate issued a notice to inform the public and published the rules for using the reporting bell, which are posted at the front of the court for public viewing.

### Listed Stocks to be Officially Announced Soon; Income Tax to be Levied on Stock and Bond Transactions

The registration of brokers and listed stocks at the Public Business Association ended on the 20th of this month. Dozens of stocks and a number of brokers have applied for registration, and the relevant authorities are currently reviewing them one by one. It is expected that the announcement can be made by tomorrow. The income tax on stocks and bonds will also begin to be collected soon.

### Save on Christmas Expenses, Donate Funds for Poverty Relief

Readers of this newspaper have launched a fundraising campaign to raise 100,000 yuan for poverty relief. People from all walks of life have responded enthusiastically. Today is Christmas and the anniversary of the Yunnan Uprising. It is hoped that all 200,000 Christians in Shanghai will uphold the "spirit of Jesus's universal love and mutual assistance," cease all inappropriate spending, and save a portion of their expenses on food, sweets, and entertainment to donate to this newspaper's poverty relief fund. Mr. Gan Dounan sent a letter donating 1,000 yuan in the name of the Li Yu Changcheng Brand Hot Water Bottle Factory to help the poor and sick in society. The remaining balance of the poverty relief fund is 4,697 yuan. Mr. Pu Qiting also donated two books of meal tickets. Gu Shangqin, an unemployed teacher, wrote that he has been unable to find work in Shanghai and is relying on his mother's employment as a domestic worker to survive. He asks readers for help.

### Passing Through Chinese Territory Iron Gates at Night

Only Need to Show ID. The French Concession curfew has been lifted. Regarding the iron gates and Laobeimen (Old North Gate) bordering Chinese territory, etc., they are now open all night. Pedestrians only need to show their curfew passes to pass through. Now that the curfew in the French Concession has been lifted, in the future, they only need to show their identity card, residence permit, or citizen identification card to pass through.

### Police Department Issues Notice to All Lianbao: Prepare for Fire Drills; Each Household to Prepare a Bucket of Water and Yellow Sand; Storefronts Should Hang Warning Signs

The police departments in each district of the Public Concession recently issued a notice to the lianbao (joint security organizations) in their respective districts, instructing them to notify their subordinate baojia (neighborhood watch) to comply with the following matters: 1. Each household must set up a bucket of tap water, a bucket of yellow sand, and other fire prevention materials. 2. Each storefront must set up a wooden board 5 inches wide and 15 inches high with white characters on a black background. One side should read "Air Raid Alert" and the other side should read "Warning Alert." 3. Each lianbao should conduct two or three fire prevention and rescue drills in the near future and report the organization and equipment of each class under its jurisdiction to the baojia department of each police department. The highest authorities will suddenly conduct a fire drill at a certain time, and all bao and classes under each lianbao must be fully prepared at all times. The lianbao chiefs should forward these points to their subordinate bao, classes, squads, and residents and ensure that they comply with them.

### Municipal Police Bureau to Implement Second Salary Increase

Recently, prices have soared, and the livelihoods of public servants have become increasingly difficult. In order to stabilize the lives of public servants, the central government has decided to implement a second salary increase to meet current living needs. The Municipal Police Bureau has received the order and has instructed all subordinate branches, the Detective Corps, and the Water Patrol to submit the second salary increase list within a limited time for review. Failure to do so will be considered as voluntarily giving up the increase.

### Central Reserve Bank to Reduce Remittance Rates for Shanghai Remittances, Effective from the 28th of This Month; Remittances to Hankou and Ningbo Limited to 5,000 Yuan per Household

In order to facilitate the transfer of funds to and from various regions, the Central Reserve Bank, after careful study, plans to reduce the remittance rates for remittances from Shanghai to various regions uniformly and to charge the lowest possible handling fee for remittances to Shanghai from various regions, regardless of the amount, so as to smooth the flow of funds. It is reported that this measure is scheduled to be implemented from the 28th of this month, and the banks in this city have all expressed their support, which will greatly benefit the development of the financial sector.

Limits on Remittances to Various Regions

Since the relevant authorities in this port have strictly cracked down on speculation and various investment transactions, idle funds can no longer continue to wreak havoc. Therefore, those with idle funds have sought other ways to transfer cash to the interior and purchase agricultural products in an attempt to hoard and profit, leading to a sharp rise in prices in the interior. Seeing this situation, the authorities in this city have formulated measures to restrict remittances to various regions, stipulating that remittances to the interior (referring to the peaceful areas) should not exceed a certain amount. Large remittances must specify their purpose. The scope of remittances is limited to remittances for the purchase of agricultural products in the peaceful areas, although not restricted, but the remitters are limited to purchasing merchants. The Central Reserve Bank has set a limit of 5,000 yuan per household for remittances to Hankou and Ningbo. The total daily remittance to branches and offices in Anqing and other places along the Yangtze River downstream is limited to 100,000 yuan. After the limit is exceeded, acceptance will be stopped. However, the above limits are temporary. If the hoarding trend in the interior subsides, the restrictions will be lifted.

### Fire Trucks in Urban Areas Given Fuel Allocation

Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the source of gasoline for this city has been interrupted. In order to effectively reduce fuel consumption, the authorities have cracked down on fuel in this city, and all public and private vehicles in the city have been restricted, which has also caused problems with fuel for fire trucks in urban areas, causing vehicles to stall. Considering that fire trucks are crucial to the security of urban areas, relevant authorities have repeatedly discussed the matter and a resolution has been reached to allocate fuel separately. Therefore, the threat to the fuel for fire trucks in urban areas has been lifted.

### Urban Tax Rates to be Adjusted Next Year

Recently, the cost of living for urban residents has soared, commercial profits are high, and municipal expenditures are huge, resulting in a significant revenue shortfall. In order to meet the needs of urban revenue and expenditure, the Municipal Finance Bureau will thoroughly adjust the existing tax rates based on the actual situation. It is reported that the tax rate principle has been determined and is currently being discussed with relevant departments. The new tax rates will be implemented from the 30th fiscal year (next year).

### Report on Scholarship Fund

Recently, the scholarship fund of this newspaper has been generously supported by people from all walks of life, benefiting many needy people. Yesterday, Mr. Pan Ziyi transferred 500 yuan originally intended for his wife, Ms. Pan Qu, to the scholarship fund as a merit, benefiting his friends and family. Wang Zhizuo donated 100 yuan, San Yuan donated 35 yuan, Wei Bo donated 30 yuan, Liu Zichang, Sun Shoupeng, and Liu Ziping jointly donated 30 yuan, and Shanghai New Middle School donated 20 yuan. The previous balance was 100,598 yuan and 1 jiao and 2 fen. The total balance is 100,621 yuan and 1 jiao and 2 fen.

### Shanghai Rural Area Party Office Promotes Various Tasks

Since the Chinese Kuomintang Shanghai Rural Area Party Office moved to Pudong to work, although it has only been forty days, under the leadership of Deputy Directors Ling Xianjiao and Li Wenxi and Wen Huanzhi, all party workers have actively promoted the party affairs, civil movements, and coordinated propaganda work in various districts of Shanghai where ruralization is being implemented for the first time. The division of district branches has now been completed. A total of 39 district branches have been established, including 17 in Nanhui District, 12 in Fengxian District, and 10 in Beiqiao District. The district executive committee members have been selected and appointed.

### Milk Prices to Increase Tomorrow

The Municipal Council issued Announcement No. 618, stating that the maximum selling price of fresh milk sold in the Public Concession has been separately stipulated and will be implemented by the Bureau from the 26th: (A.T.T.) grade: 9 yuan and 3 jiao per quart, 4 yuan and 7 jiao per pint, 2 yuan and 4 jiao and 5 fen per half-pint, A grade: 8 yuan and 5 jiao, 4 yuan and 5 jiao, 1 yuan and 3 jiao and 5 fen, B grade: 7 yuan and 9 jiao, 4 yuan, 2 yuan and 1 jiao.

(Note) The price of cream is not subject to price control.

### Arrested Traffickers of Military Weapons

Li Yinmin, a Chinese detective of the Criminal Division of the Public Concession Police, detectives Peng Bingsheng, Yang Zhong, and others recently learned that someone was holding military weapons with the intention of selling them. They ordered officers to contact these people at 1212 Lubin Road on the previous day. At that time, they showed two Mauser pistols and eight bullets and asked for 10,000 yuan. The detectives arrested five weapon traffickers including Xia Yuezheng, Shao Dinghua, Xia Linpei, Xia Qingzhang, and Liang, along with the pistols and bullets, and brought them to the police station. Xia Yuezheng confessed that the weapons were stolen from the home of Zhu Quantong, the chief of the Third Lianbao in the Jing'an Temple area at 18 Lane 1400, Avenue Edouard VII, because his wife, Shen Luying, worked for Zhu as a domestic servant and stole them when she had the opportunity. The detectives also arrested Shen Luying and sent her to the First Special Court yesterday. Because further investigation is needed, the court ordered her to be detained pending further review.

### The Vigorous Situation of Chinese Stocks Before the Holiday - Business as Usual on January 5th

Yesterday, the trading situation for Chinese merchant stocks marked the final day of the year's transactions. The market will be closed for the New Year holiday starting today and will resume trading on January 5th. The general trend of selling to obtain cash has subsided, and the previously tight monetary conditions have eased, boosting investor activity. Wealthy investors are particularly determined to identify and acquire targets, leading to a more robust situation. For example, in the newly listed stock of the Sino-French Pharmacy, part of the "New One Industry," prices soared to $29.50. The Xinyi Pharmacy reached $260. However, the Minyi Pharmacy's method of increasing capital through subscription triggered selling pressure. The "Little Three Yuan" stocks uniquely reached the $70 mark, and Kang Yuan Canned Goods hit a high of $52.50. Among financial stocks, the China & South Sea Bank saw transactions at $140, with fewer subsequent deals. In the utilities sector, Shanghai Electric Power and Zhabei Water & Electricity each rose by $1.50. In the department store sector, Wing On rose to $34, and both Sincere and China Emporium each rose by over $2. The Lai Wah Company saw transactions reaching as high as $332.50. In the textile industry, Wing On Textile Factory rose by $35, and the Dasheng No. 1 and No. 3 factories also stopped falling and stabilized. Small denomination stocks such as the Great China reached $10.75. Nanyang Brothers Tobacco rose by $5. In the cultural sector, only World Book Company rose by $2.50, while Commercial Press and Chung Hwa Book Co. declined with significant trading volume.

### Monetary Conditions Have Eased - Joint Reserve Notes Rise Another Five Cents

Yesterday, the Shanghai Money Exchange Association's overnight interbank lending rate suddenly dropped to a low of 2.2 cents, indicating an easing of monetary conditions, it is said.

Japanese military scrip remained stagnant. Interbank trading was priced at $5.5525, with silver firms and small money shops selling at $5.56 and buying back at $5.545. Joint Reserve Notes rose another five cents. Dealers sold at $4.15 and bought back at $4.10, it is said.

Yesterday, the Shanghai jewelry industry's Daxin firm listed the retail price of gold ornaments at $3,050 per tael, unchanged. (Buying back reduced by about $300). The informal market among firms initially appeared sluggish but suddenly strengthened at noon. The morning low was $2,700, followed by $2,780, slightly decreasing to $2,760. Around noon, a certain firm's buying spree caused a sudden rise, with $2,800 difficult to obtain, a $20 or $40 difference compared to the previous day. Trading volume was sparse. The listed price of sycee silver ornaments remained at $16 per tael, with interbank trading around $17.

### 100 Member Banks - 48 New Members

Recently, the establishment of new banks in Shanghai has been exceptionally vigorous. As a result, the number of member banks in the Banking Association has increased from 54 last year to 100. In addition to the original 52 banks (excluding the China Farmers Bank and Jiangsu Farmers Bank), the following 48 banks have joined as new members: Darlai, Sichuan Trust, Tongyuan, Dakang, Chongqing, Qiantai, Shanghai-Asia West, Zhongyong, Jiading, Hetai, Dagong, Anhua, Zhongmao, Guangzhong, Huamao, Shanghai Iron Industry, Yongfeng, Zhongya, Shangye, Huiyuan, Limin, Xintai, Jianghai, Daya, Guoxin, Yongtai, Great Wall, Shanghai Industrial, Daxin, China Fisheries, Guofu, Nanyang, China Tobacco, Dayuan, Weiye, Shanghai Industrial and Commercial, Futong, Jiangsu Local, Shanghai Industrial, Wuzhou, Guanyi, Fuhua, Shanghai Yarn Industry, China Industrial, Jiu'an, China Yushang, Lianyi Jiuchang, Dazhong, and 24 others.

### Public Bonds Trading Opens for Types C and E

There was very little trading in the gray market for Unified Public Bonds. Only Type C was traded at $54.50 and $54, and Type E at $52, with transactions of several tens of thousands. The closing price was down by $0.06 to $0.08. No other types were traded, it is said.

### Peach Blossom Lady Cloth - Spot Goods Exceed Factory Orders

The factory market sentiment is stable with minimal fluctuations. Yesterday, the opening price for 12-pound Globe shirting was $193.25, later rising to $193.50, with no one selling. The same weight of Fugui Dapeng fluctuated around $193, with only small amounts of wholesale transactions. The factory order for Peach Blossom Lady cloth was at a minimum price of $312 in the morning, closing at $314 in the afternoon, with the later market even trading at $314.50. Spot goods, however, have already exceeded factory orders, increasing by $1 to $1.50. Chicken Muslin also requires a price of $214.

East cloth also turned upwards yesterday. The bank order for 12-pound Dragon Head shirting rose from $198.25 to $199.25, an increase of $0.075. The factory order for the new Dragon Head, however, remained sluggish as before, closing at $197.75 in the afternoon. Rainbow Ball was at $198.25, and Flying Fish and Yangji were quoted at $197.75. The red order for Four Gentlemen serge rose from $7.66 to $7.72. Bank orders were particularly strong, reaching as high as $7.87.

### Expensive Woolen Goods Selling Poorly

Due to a shortage of available capital, the prices of woolen goods are difficult to recover. Yesterday, Yin Feng's No. 1 camel-colored cashmere was sold at 100 yuan per yard, yuan-colored breeches cloth at 250 yuan, gray at 225 yuan, straight-sale cloth at 240 yuan, China Yuanfeng navy blue valencia at 210 yuan, Yuanfeng Flying Horse suit cloth at 145 yuan, Three White Edge Zigong at 375 yuan, Chia He No. 29 Hailing club cloth at 200 yuan, No. 55 medium-thick tweed at 140 yuan, Meifa palis at 165 yuan, and Meifeng overcoat cloth at 370 yuan. Transactions were relatively sparse because the end of the year is approaching, and all firms want to close their books. Furthermore, shipping documents are difficult to obtain, and actual sales are limited, so most owners are unwilling to sell.

### Coarse Grains Remain Stable

Yesterday, the supply and demand of coarse grains in the market were relatively balanced, and market sentiment remained stable. Transactions included 20 bags of Chongming red sand at $355, over 40 bags of Wujiang selected green beans without bags at $306, and substandard goods at $290. One truckload of Fertilizer Bean Cake was priced at $81.50, and three truckloads of Yuanlong Bean Cake were priced at $81 to $81.50.

### Superior Dangyuan Osmanthus Eyes Are More Popular

Osmanthus eyes have been available in the market for several days. The market price of miscellaneous-grade Yuanxing is around $4, without much fluctuation. However, because Dangyuan Dasanyuan is in limited quantity and the goods are of better quality, its asking price is more than 20% higher than $4, making it very firm.

### Orchid Rice Arrivals Are Scarce

Recently, the arrival of orchid rice has been limited, and the cost is also high. It is understood that only a few dozen boxes have arrived this time, and the quality and color are good. However, because the asking price is relatively high, no transactions have been made yet. The market sentiment is stable.

### The Market for Rebar is Stagnant

The local Shanghai construction industry has long had no appetite for rebar, and merchants from the north road in Tianjin and Yantai are also inactive. Therefore, the entire market situation is stagnant. However, the inventory in Yichang is low, and those holding goods have not lowered prices due to poor sales, and prices remain very firm. Yesterday's market saw 40-foot standard-grade rebar of 3-4 points of various colors selling for $11,000 per ton. 5-inch to 1-inch goods were sold for $10,500 per ton, and 3-foot starter goods were priced at $7,500 to $8,000 per ton, depending on the specification.

### High-End Cigarettes Continue to Soar

Cigarette sales are balanced, with prices fluctuating. British American Tobacco was at $9,350, Old Knife at $8,400, Pin Hai at $8,000, Fairy at $7,800, Wuhua at $6,350, Japanese cigarettes Golden Gun at $1,850, Golden Deer at $3,200, Red Rose at $2,500, Quanlu at $2,950, Nian Zhi at $2,900, Compass at $2,350, national cigarettes Pyramid at $6,400, and Beauty at $5,750. The selling prices of high-end goods, however, continue to soar. 50-piece Egret were at $28,500, Dananwei at $16,000, Great Five at $25,000, Big Stage at $13,500, and Little Cannon at $8,500, all per 10,000 cigarettes, an increase of $1,000 to $2,000 compared to previous prices.

Random Thoughts

### Jesus and Cai E

— Jian Nong

Thinking back to this day more than 1,940 years ago, Jesus, the light of the world and the gospel for mankind, was born in a secluded and humble manger in Bethlehem, Judea, barely sheltered from the cold wind. Do you truly not believe he is the light of the world and the gospel for mankind? Please consider how his profound words illuminated this dark world and comforted suffering humanity!

When he sat on the mountain and first openly taught the masses, he proclaimed, completely contrary to common sense: "Blessed are the poor in spirit... Blessed are those who mourn... Blessed are the meek... Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness... Blessed are the merciful... Blessed are the pure in heart... Blessed are the peacemakers... Blessed are those who are persecuted because of righteousness!" The vast crowd, upon hearing these peculiar and unexpected words, were initially stunned and bewildered, then frowned and expressed doubt, before finally being convinced and enlightened. Then, a breath of relief emerged from their long-suffering hearts; a faint smile appeared on their long-suffering faces; and when they looked around and ahead, it no longer seemed so dark, so terrifyingly dark! Each of them then roused themselves and found the courage to walk the path of life. I also hope that all of us today, as we commemorate the birth of Jesus, will deeply contemplate those profound words that can enlighten and comfort us.

Cai E's spirit and demeanor were of course different from those of Jesus. However, when he was the Governor of Yunnan, the military and civilians were grateful and wanted to donate money to cast a bronze statue and build a living shrine for him, he instead took the money and distributed it to the starving people, saying: "...The wailing masses can live countless lives by eating this small amount of charity: Promoting a person's merits is not as good as saving lives." - According to Chen Yizhe's "New Sayings of the Woods" - this compassionate and chivalrous spirit is also worthy of our admiration and emulation! How many starving and freezing people are in Shanghai today, awaiting urgent relief! Is there anyone who can emulate Cai Songpo's benevolence? I deeply pray for this on this day commemorating the Yunnan Uprising. (In response to the donation of winter clothing).

### A Brief History of Party Newspapers Before the 1911 Revolution

— Shi

During the 1911 Revolution, popular movements surged across the country, responding enthusiastically, which was the result of the tireless efforts of revolutionary newspapers at that time to advocate and encourage. At that time, the Qing government initially promoted newspapers for reform because it was humiliated by foreign powers. After the Wuxu Coup, Empress Dowager Cixi was attacked by domestic public opinion, and she became angry and severely cracked down on newspapers and suppressed public opinion in an effort to cut off revolutionary movement. On August 24th of the 24th year of Guangxu (1898), the publication of newspapers in Tianjin, Shanghai, Hankou and other places was prohibited, and the main people were strictly searched and arrested. However, this proposition did not take effect. Generally, people with lofty ideals were not tempted by profit or threatened by power, and still held a full of enthusiasm and strived for the revolution.

The Earliest Revolutionary Newspaper - China Daily First Voice

The earliest newspaper to advocate revolution was the China Daily, published in Hong Kong in the 25th year of Guangxu (1899). It was hosted by Chen Shaobai, sent by Premier Sun Yat-sen in Hong Kong. It advocated nationalism and advocated opposition to the Qing Dynasty. Its most important text was "The Future of Democracy and Chinese Political Revolution." The succession of newspapers that were established were the Su Daily, the National Daily, the Alarm Bell Daily, the Guangdong Daily, the Yousuowei Daily, the Juvenile Daily, the Minhu Daily, the Minwang Daily, the Minli Daily, the Tianduo Daily, the Fubao Daily, the Minbao Daily, and the New China of the 20th Century, etc.: As for the Guangdong Daily, the Yousuowei Daily, and the Juvenile Daily, etc., their arguments were more moderate than the China Daily, and they were not pure propaganda newspapers like the China Daily. Among them, the Su Daily case, which caused a sensation for literary inquisition and had the most impact, was the Su Daily case. The Su Daily was founded in the summer of the 23rd year of Guangxu (1897), first operated by Hu Tiemei, but his Japanese wife, Ikoma Etsu, was responsible for coming forward and registered with the Japanese Consulate General in Shanghai. Later, Chen Fan invested in the purchase. He was a native of Hengshan, Hunan, and was removed from his position as Magistrate of Jiangxi due to a church case. He hated the corruption of the officialdom and wanted to awaken the Chinese people through public opinion. Among them, Zhang Xian belonged to the Constitutionalist Party, but later saw that Kang Liangzhongzhang was not thorough, so he changed to the revolutionary faction.

The writers for the Su Daily included Wu Zhihui, Zhang Taiyan, Cai Yuanpei, Zou Rong, Xu Xilin, and Qiu Jin, who were most noticed by the Qing government. In the 29th year of Guangxu (1903), Zou Rong, a native of Sichuan, organized the Patriotic Society and published the book Revolutionary Army, which was heartbroken and determined to overthrow the Manchu Qing as its mission. Zhang Taiyan wrote a preface and explained the contents of the book in the new book introduction column of the Su Daily. The Qing government was furious and arrested Zou Zhang and others in the Shanghai Concession and demanded extradition, but the authorities in the boundary refused. After unsuccessful negotiations, it only organized an extra public hall for joint trial, sentencing Zou Rong to two years of imprisonment and Zhang Taiyan to three years of imprisonment. Zou Rong later died in prison. Zhang Taiyan was released from prison on June 27th of the 32nd year of Guangxu (1906) and went to Tokyo.

The people in the Su Daily were not discouraged by this. In June of the same year, they initiated the founding of the National Daily, with the supplement "Dark World," edited by Su Heng (Mu Qin), sparing no effort in attacking the bureaucrats. The Qing government, considering the difficulty of negotiations in the concession, issued an order strictly prohibiting merchants and civilians along the Yangtze River from subscribing, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs sent a document to the General Postal Affairs Department to inform the post office not to deliver the National Daily, but at that time the post office was just emerging, and most of the newspapers were delivered by private letters, so the Qing government still could not achieve its goal.

The Minbao issued a lion's roar with the momentum of precious paper in Luoyang

After the establishment of the Tongmenghui, in order to promote the spirit of racial revolution and publicize the true meaning of the Three Principles of the People, Premier Sun Yat-sen founded the Fubao and the Minbao in Tokyo between the 31st and 32nd years of Guangxu. The Fubao was edited by Liu Shuaipei, and the Minbao was first edited by Zhang Ji, and his opinions were extremely fierce, and the main purpose and political program were published in Chinese and English in the most prominent position in the newspaper: (1) Overthrow the current bad government: (2) Land nationalization: (3) Leave the world truly at peace; (4) Build a republican government; (5) Request all countries to approve China's revolutionary new undertaking. Premier Sun Yat-sen had already proclaimed the Three Principles of the People, nationalism, democracy, and people's livelihood, in the inaugural speech of the Minbao, in which there was such an elaboration:

"I think that the evolution of Europe and the United States is based on three major principles: nationalism, democracy, and people's livelihood. The death of Rome is because the principle of nationalism dominates the country, and the authority is tyrannical. If those below are not suffering, the principle of democracy will rise. In the 18th century in the Americas, and at the beginning of the 19th century, despotism was overthrown and the republican government was established. The world is civilized, human intelligence is increasing, and material purchases are booming. The century is sharper than a thousand years. Economic problems follow political problems, and the principle of people's livelihood is eager to move. The 20th century must be the era of the promotion of the principle of people's livelihood."

In addition, the outstanding articles in the Minbao were the National Theory of Nationalism, "China's Constitution Must Be Revolutionary" and the novel "Lion's Roar". After Zhang Taiyan arrived in Tokyo, he edited it, which was very popular among those who followed it and internationally, with the momentum of precious paper in Luoyang.

Yu Boxun (Youren) of the other faction of the Restoration Society wrote books to oppose the Manchus, which was extremely fierce. During the heyday of the Minbao in Tokyo, he went from Shaanxi Province to Shanghai and, together with Wang Shoucen and other core figures in the Bingzhong Party, organized the Shenzhou Daily. Later, he founded the Minhu Daily, the Minyu Daily, and the Minli Daily. Song Jiaoren, under the pseudonym "Fisherman," published brilliant articles in the Minli Daily, striving to promote revolutionary ideas. All the discussions were based on academic principles, which could repeatedly explain the corruption of the Qing government and awaken the people's sense of responsibility for national affairs, which was most welcomed by the intellectual class at home and abroad.

The Minli Daily is brilliant and occupies the top spot among party newspapers at that time

These three newspapers were born one after another, and under the pressure of autocratic power, their fates were extremely short-lived. The Minhu Daily was founded in the spring of the first year of Xuantong (1909), specializing in attacking the corruption of the officialdom. The authorities took the opportunity to destroy it, and Yu went to Japan. The newspaper was published for only 39 days. In the autumn of the same year, Tan Shanwu continued to run the Minyu Daily, changed its arguments and devoted itself to attacking Japan. The Japanese Consul General in Shanghai requested Shanghai to seal it, and it was only published for 42 days. On September 9th of the following year, the Minli Daily appeared with a fearless attitude. The writers for the newspaper included Song Jiaoren, Lv Zhiyi, Wang Yinze, Zhang Xingyan, and Tan Hongkun, etc., advocating an urgent and practical attitude. It could sell more than 20,000 copies every day, and the printing press worked day and night, occupying the top spot among the party newspapers at that time.

After the establishment of the Republic of China, it had the reputation of "three vertical and three horizontal principles of the people". The three vertical principles of the people are the Minhu, Minyu, and Minli, and the three horizontal principles of the people were the Minquan founded by Dai Tianchou (Chuanxian), the National News founded by Lv Zhongyi, and the China Minbao founded by Deng Jiazhi. The three horizontal principles of the people were radical in their arguments and more emotional, so the Minli Daily still occupied the top spot. Later, Yu ran for national affairs, and the newspaper business was entrusted to others to handle, and the arguments changed, and the sales also decreased. The only one that remained was the Shenzhou Daily.

After Kang Youwei went to Japan, Premier Sun Yat-sen also rushed from London. The revolutionary people in Japan all hoped that Sun and Kang could join hands and work together on a large scale, but Premier Sun Yat-sen was a revolutionary party that advocated democracy, while Kang Youwei was a constitutionalist monarchist party. In the end, the two factions separated and became more and more distant due to the fundamental incompatibility of monarchism and democracy. The Constitutionalist Party took the New People's Journal, which was hosted by Liang Qichao, as its base, and the Revolutionary Party took the Minbao, which was hosted by Zhang Ji and Zhang Taiyan, as its base. The two sides formally debated democratic constitutionalism, and as a result of the struggle, the Constitutionalist Party failed. The central argument that the Constitutionalist Party's newspaper officially promoted was constitutional monarchy; however, the Qing government's pseudo-constitutional movement prepared to destroy constitutionalism under the name of constitutionalism, thus causing the Constitutionalist Party to lose its position.

### Sharing Weal and Woe

— He Jiazhi

A Branch of the Song of Courtyard Flowers after the Year End

Huang Long was looking forward to Wei Cheng uttering these words, saying; "Who said we're not going? Let's go!" Encouraged by Huang Long, and with Huang Long as a companion, Wei Cheng truly meant what he said: let's go! He stood up, leading the way for Huang Long. Huang Long said: "Are we really going? If we're really going, we'll go quietly, and come back quietly before dawn." Wei Cheng thought for a moment, this made sense. Otherwise, Aunt, Sister Cuizhen, A Xing, who wouldn't stop us from leaving? So he said: "Then, let's go through the west door." At that moment, Wei Cheng felt that he couldn't be indecisive any longer. He immediately reached into his pocket, and with a "puff" he blew out the lamp. From the west entrance, the two of them sneaked outside. Everything went smoothly. There was no wind at night, so the closed door wouldn't be blown open. Even the yellow dog, propping itself up on its two front paws at the wicker gate, recognized Wei Cheng and Huang Long as acquaintances, and just wagged its tail, letting the two of them pass. The two walked along in the darkness, one foot high, one foot low. They walked four miles in one breath. Huang Long, in front, still seemed carefree. Wei Cheng couldn't keep up. At first, relying on a surge of courage, he didn't find it too difficult, but later he complained that Huang Long was walking too fast. Huang Long said: "Instead of saying you're walking too slowly, you say I'm walking too fast. If we walk too slowly, we'll have to come back and be afraid we won't make it in time." Wei Cheng said: "Let's just keep walking."

They walked another five or six miles, which was still only half the way. Wei Cheng gasped and laughed: "Don't think I've lost heart. I absolutely haven't lost heart. You go your way. If you think I'm walking too slowly, you can walk ahead for a while and wait for me up there. Huang Long said: "Actually, you're a fool, and I'm a fool too. As long as I rush over there, I can help you raise your hand. White blade in, red blade out. I won't kill the wrong person, and I won't mistake someone I didn't kill for someone I did kill. If you don't believe me, I can cut off one ear from each person and bring it back for you to see." Wei Cheng said: "Don't say that. Let's just keep walking." The two, relying on their courage to come back again, walked all the way to Shuangqiao Town. They didn't check into Wang Shunxing's place, but went straight to the entrance of Chen Guoqi and Guofang's house. Huang Long said: "You stand outside for a moment. I'll go over there, open the door from the inside, and let you in." Huang Long just squatted down, and over the Chen family's low, low house, with a "whoosh" he was already on the roof. Wei Cheng bit his lip and leaned against the door, holding his breath and listening carefully. (252)
