### Prime Minister Fraser Confirms: New Zealand Divided into a Zone, Southwest Pacific Naval Department Reorganized

Lisbon, 22nd, Associated Press: A dispatch from Canberra states that on the 20th, the Commander-in-Chief of the Allied Forces in the Southwest Pacific, General MacArthur, announced that New Zealand had been incorporated into the Southwest Pacific Theater. From now on, New Zealand will be under the command of the U.S. Pacific Fleet Commander.

Wellington, 23rd, Reuters: New Zealand Prime Minister Fraser confirmed today that New Zealand and its island territories, including Fiji, have been divided into a zone called the South Pacific Zone, under the control of the U.S. naval commander. He stated that this zone is separate from the Southwest Pacific Command led by General MacArthur. The governments of the United States, Britain, Australia, and New Zealand have all agreed to this new division. We originally hoped that Australia and New Zealand would remain closely linked and be included in the zone led by General MacArthur, and have made this suggestion. However, the strategic reasons determined by Washington are paramount and must be followed. Arrangements have now been made to maintain cooperation between the Australian and New Zealand governments, and between General MacArthur and the commander of New Zealand and the South Pacific Zone. The overall Pacific theater war effort will be coordinated by the chiefs of staff and the Pacific War Council in Washington. Brigadier General Cos has been sent to Australia to serve as General MacArthur's chief of staff, establishing military liaison.

Washington, 23rd, Reuters: According to reliable sources today, the Supreme Headquarters of the Army in the Southwest Pacific will be reorganized. Following General MacArthur's appointment as Supreme Commander, the Supreme Headquarters of the Navy in that area will also be reorganized accordingly. The position of Commander-in-Chief in New Zealand will be filled by Vice Admiral Ghormley, former U.S. Naval Observer in London. It is unknown whether land warfare in New Zealand will still be under the command of General MacArthur, but it has been decided that Vice Admiral Ghormley will determine the general strategy for that area.

Stockholm, 23rd, Overseas Chinese News Agency: A dispatch from Melbourne states that preparations for the establishment of a joint U.S.-New Zealand naval command are now complete. It is reported that the command will be located in Auckland, with U.S. Rear Admiral Ghormley serving as commander-in-chief, maintaining close contact with General MacArthur, Commander-in-Chief of the Allied Forces in the Southwest Pacific.

Washington, 22nd, Reuters: Authoritative sources here predict that naval command in the Southwest Pacific will also be reorganized in accordance with the reorganization of General MacArthur's army command. It is understood that the plan for this change includes the appointment of Vice Admiral Ghormley as naval commander of the New Zealand zone, under the command of Admiral Nimitz, Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Pacific Fleet. Ghormley recently served as naval observer in Britain. According to various sources, it is not yet certain whether MacArthur's supreme command, according to the revised new structure, includes land warfare in New Zealand, but the general strategy for the region will be determined by Ghormley under Nimitz's orders.

Melbourne, 23rd, Reuters: Allied Headquarters here announced today the appointment of U.S. Navy Captain Jones as a staff officer to the Allied Naval Commander in the Southwest Pacific. Other new appointments include ten U.S. officers, one Australian, one Dutch East Indian, and one Australian Air Force officer.

Japanese Military Base in the Philippines, 23rd, Associated Press: Several Japanese bombers flew over the western mountainous areas of Panay Island yesterday morning, strafing enemy remnants' positions with machine guns. Another team of Japanese planes attacked the enemy retreating towards the mountainous areas north of Cebu City on Cebu Island. All planes returned safely. According to a report from the Asahi Shimbun, the Japanese forces pursuing the remnants on Panay Island reached the high mountains on the western border on the 20th of this month. The enemy abandoned their armor and fled. Currently, only about five or six hundred remnants are stubbornly resisting in the jungles of Mount Baloy, the highest peak on Panay Island.

Melbourne, 23rd, Reuters: Allied Headquarters in the Southwest Pacific announced in a communique today that U.S. forces in the southern part of Panay Island, Philippines, are currently in contact with Japanese forces.

### British Members of Parliament Inquire About the Current State of the Navy, Alexander Says Command is Difficult, House of Lords Discusses Cooperation Among Allied Countries

London, 22nd, Havas: During today's meeting of the House of Commons, members of Parliament raised questions about the current state of the British Navy. First Lord of the Admiralty Alexander immediately replied that although the British Navy has suffered significant losses recently, there will be no changes in the naval command. "Even if we consider changing the commander, it would be politically unwise to announce this intention externally. Moreover, we have not considered this at all at this time. Chief of the Naval Staff Admiral Pound has been in his current position since the beginning of the current war. According to regulations, he can be transferred to another position within a short period of time, but the people's love for the admiral is endless, and the government should make an exception to retain him."

London, 22nd, Havas: The House of Commons will hold a closed-door meeting in the coming days, which political circles are extremely concerned about. It is said that Prime Minister Churchill will likely submit a general report to the House of Commons, outlining the various events that have occurred on the battlefields in the past six months. Members of Parliament will raise various questions about the setbacks suffered by the British Navy and the government's strategic plans. In short, convening a closed-door meeting will definitely help clarify the political atmosphere, and the various questions recently raised by the Labor Party to the government can also be resolved as a result.

London, 23rd, Havas: Minister of Military Production Lyttelton announced in the House of Commons today that the government has decided to send an industrial delegation to the United States to exchange views with representatives of the industrial community in that country on military industrial matters. At the same time, the United States will also send a similar delegation to the United Kingdom. London, 22nd, Havas: The House of Lords today discussed the issue of adjusting the war efforts of Britain and the United States. First, the opposition Labor Party leader Lord Strabolgi asked the government what measures it has taken to adjust the war efforts of Britain and the United States, saying, "Looking at the visit of U.S. Army Chief of Staff General Marshall, it is evident that cooperation between the two countries is still insufficient. We lack talent to plan this work." In terms of various military strategy issues, our government should maintain close contact with the Soviet Union. Lord Selborne, Minister of Economic Warfare, replied on behalf of the government, "The staff departments of the twenty-six Allied countries have been able to cooperate fully, but in the entire war, what we should consider is not limited to purely military issues. All economic and social issues, such as the efficient use of manpower or the distribution of raw materials, must be taken into account. Therefore, they should first be studied separately by the governments of the Allied countries, and then adjusted through direct contact between the leaders of the governments or representatives of the staff departments. In short, although the twenty-six countries can act freely and do whatever they want, the chiefs of staff of each country have the right to make suggestions at any time. In short, Britain and the United States can cooperate fully in land and sea warfare, like the two wheels of a car, complementing each other. However, the relationship with the Soviet Union is slightly different. The navy is not very important in the German-Soviet war. Even in terms of land warfare, because the Soviet Union does not need guidance from others in combat, a joint staff department has not yet been established between them. However, there are still liaison agencies between the two countries' staff departments to maintain constant contact."

### Changes in French Envoys Abroad

Geneva, 23rd, Havas: According to special dispatches from this agency, the French government will soon change ambassadors to certain countries.

### Cripps to Make Statement on India Mission, British Declaration and Defense Proposals Released Yesterday as White Paper

London, 23rd, Reuters: The British War Cabinet declaration carried by British Lord Privy Seal Cripps to India, the revised proposals submitted to the leaders of the Indian National Congress on defense issues, and the correspondence between Indian leaders and Cripps have been released as a White Paper today. Churchill's speech in the House of Commons announcing the Cripps Mission is also published in the White Paper. Cripps is expected to make a statement on his mission to India at the next meeting of the House of Commons.

London, 23rd, Reuters: British Lord Privy Seal Cripps visited Buckingham Palace today to report to the King on his mission to India.

Berlin, 22nd, Associated Press: It is reported that after the failure of British-Indian negotiations, the British War Cabinet intends to take the opportunity of Cripps' return to the country to invite Indian leaders such as Nehru to convene a roundtable conference. German government authorities have recently criticized this British attempt, saying that if Indian leaders express opposition to the British side's views at the roundtable conference, they will undoubtedly be arrested by the British on their way back to India. The arrest of former Burmese Prime Minister U Saw is a lesson from the past. Moreover, Gandhi was also arrested by British officials after attending the British-Indian Roundtable Conference in 1935. In view of past facts, Indian leaders such as Nehru and Jinnah themselves are still aware of what kind of treatment they will receive.

Stockholm, 23rd, Overseas Chinese News Agency: British Lord Privy Seal Cripps told reporters yesterday, "I do not believe that the Indian problem cannot be solved during the wartime period. But the preliminary work should be carried out by India." The British government does not intend to draft an Indian constitution under the current circumstances.

Stockholm, 23rd, Overseas Chinese News Agency: Lord Cripps revealed at an intelligence conference yesterday that before leaving India, he proposed to Indian leaders the establishment of an autonomous government in India during the war, but stipulated that India must join forces with Britain in the war. He did not mention what the Indian leaders' response was. Cripps denied rumors that Chiang Kai-shek had participated in the British-Indian problem, saying that Chiang had gone to India at the invitation of the British and had no intention of interfering in the British-Indian negotiations.

### First Batch of U.S. Troops Has Arrived in India, Strength and Location Not Announced

Indian Problem Special Collection

### 7. Indian Transportation (Part 1)

Regarding Indian geography, we have already given a brief account in the first section, "Starting from Geography." Now, we will discuss Indian transportation. In modern times, railways undoubtedly occupy the primary position, but India's dense network of rivers must also be fully utilized for freight transport. The various transportation situations are described below:

Utilization of Rivers

When transporting goods from place A to place B, several things must be considered: travel expenses, overall speed or time, and whether the goods will be damaged during transport. Perhaps the most important factor is the cost of travel. If goods are transported by waterway, only the crew's wages and shipbuilding costs need to be calculated. Railway transport is more expensive because building railways requires a huge amount of money. Constructing the tracks is not enough; there are also the costs of carriages and locomotives, coal consumption, and railway staff salaries, all of which must be taken into account. Transporting goods by road involves not only the wages of laborers but also the feed for livestock. A horse can haul a ton of goods on an ordinary road, but a sand barge carrying four tons of goods can travel in a canal. Therefore, regardless of the time taken, water transport is cheaper, but the essential condition is a navigable river. Of course, canals can be dug by human power, but this requires a lot of financial resources to build and maintain, and it cannot be done in mountainous areas. Goods that need to be delivered quickly must use trains. The application of trucks is becoming more common, making road transport more convenient, especially for short-distance transport, which is even more important.

India has a dense network of rivers throughout its territory. Unfortunately, most of the rivers in the peninsular part dry up in the summer, and the water sources of the northern rivers are used for irrigation. Therefore, the method of using rivers for transportation is not highly valued. India's roads are relatively advanced, and the most important means of transportation is the railway. Since the laying of railways, other modes of transport have gradually been phased out. Especially in the Ganges River Plain, the railway network is densely interwoven, providing convenient access in all directions. In the peninsular part, the land has not been as extensively developed as in the plains, and there are not as many railways.

Now, let's briefly describe the waterways in the peninsular part. On the west coast, there is an important river that runs from the northern part of Malabar Province to the Travancore Province. Ships travel in a series of shallow lakes connected to the sea, with canals artificially dug in between. There is no railway on the west coast of India, and taking the sea route is dangerous due to the lack of good ports and the seasonal monsoons. There is an important canal called the Buckingham Canal, which connects the Madras and Krishna River canal systems. Because it is close to the sea, this canal is a brackish water river. Only a line of sand dunes separates the river from the sea. The reason for digging this canal was to avoid the danger of ships traveling at sea. There are several shorter rivers on the west coast used to float timber. The nearby coast has many forests, and the felled timber is transported to Kozhikode in this way.

Dirt Roads · Gravel Roads

There are two types of roads: those paved with gravel and those not paved with gravel. Gravel roads are very expensive to build, and the cost of road maintenance is also considerable. India builds many gravel roads every year. Some roads have even been paved with asphalt. Asphalt roads are certainly more expensive, but they are more durable because the road surface does not have dust, and the gravel at the bottom of the road is not washed away by rain. Roads without gravel are mostly in the countryside. When the weather is good, dust flies, and on rainy days, they are muddy and difficult to walk on, sometimes full of puddles. The most modern way to build roads is to use cement. India's most famous highway is the Grand Trunk Road, which starts from Calcutta in the east, passes through Delhi, and reaches North West Frontier Province. Construction of this road began in 1828, when railways were not yet widespread, and was completed in 1864.

There are three main highways from Madras. One goes north to Calcutta, one goes to Kozhikode on the west coast, and the third goes to Travancore in the southernmost part of the peninsula. These two roads were built before the railways existed, and they were the only means of transportation at that time, marking a glorious page in India's transportation history. There are also several more important mountain roads. One mountain road runs from the plains to Darjeeling, and another line runs from Ambala in eastern Punjab to Simla in the north. There are several good highways in the North-West Frontier Province, which can be safely traversed in case of emergency.

With the progress of the times, important cities in India are connected by highways, and buses can be seen speeding back and forth on the roads.

The main means of transport on dirt roads is bullock carts. In India, apart from the extremely humid land and deltas on the west coast, there are many dirt roads between villages that are not paved with gravel. Because the road surface is soft, with ruts running across it, even bullock carts are difficult to control. Mountain roads are even more elusive, often just a narrow path wide enough for two mules to walk side by side. Building a gravel road on the plains is sometimes more difficult than in the mountains. Stones need to be transported from afar, and special attention must be paid to building a solid road base. However, building mountain roads is quite expensive because of the many curves and the need to open up areas or build bridges.

General Overview of Railways The most important means of transportation is the railway. The distance between the rails varies. If the gauge is narrow, only small trains and smaller passenger cars can run on the railway, and the ride is relatively slow. With a wide gauge, the locomotive and carriages can be larger, and the ride can be fast and unhindered. India's train gauges vary, with four types in total, two important and two less important, described below:

Broad Gauge – The distance between the two rails is five feet six inches. The locomotive is very large, the vehicles are heavy, and the ride is fast. Broad gauge railways are very expensive to build, and the consumption during operation is high.

Meter Gauge – The distance between the two rails is one meter, equal to three feet two inches and some. The locomotive is smaller, the car body is also smaller, the ride is not as fast as the former, but it is also more economical. Meter gauge railways are not only economical to build but also convenient to operate, with no difficulty in sharp turns and curved areas.

There are also two narrow gauge railways, two feet six inches wide and two feet wide. Local or mountain railways use this narrow gauge.

The total length of Indian railway lines is called 41,000 miles, nearly half of which are broad gauge, followed by meter gauge. The gauges in Europe and the United States are different from those here and are called standard gauge. The distance between the two rails is four feet eight and a half inches. Most of the Indian railways are single-track, and trains running in opposite directions must cross over to the double track at the station. However, several major railway lines, such as those passing through Calcutta, Bombay, Madras, and Karachi, are built with double tracks, and some even have four parallel tracks.

### Minor Patrol Battle Occurs Near Boulogne on the French Coast; British Commandos Land and Withdraw After Two Hours; Minor Naval Battles Also Occur Between Small Vessels of Germany and England

London, 22nd (Havas) – The British "Commando Headquarters" recently issued a battle report stating that a minor patrol battle occurred near the port of Boulogne on the French coast at dawn today. German troops stationed along the coast were repelled by a British vanguard force, and British forces broke through the enemy's coastal defenses before withdrawing after two hours. Our losses were minimal. At the same time, our ships participating in the patrol battle engaged in naval combat with armed German fishing boats, severely damaging one German vessel and setting another on fire. No British ships sustained damage, and sailor casualties were minimal.

London, 22nd (Havas) – Regarding this morning's surprise attack on the German-occupied port of Boulogne in France by the British "European Expeditionary Commandos," a Reuters reporter witnessed the event. It is reported that our soldiers, aided by a light fleet, landed at the port and encountered a German sentry. The sentry was greatly alarmed and immediately sounded the alarm. German troops, upon hearing the alarm, immediately began firing, the sharp sounds of artillery resounding through the skies. However, contrary to our expectations, the Germans did not use machine guns for concentrated firing. Our troops advanced about several hundred yards in one breath, using a sand dune on the beach as cover, and confronted the German troops. Simultaneously, the ships anchored along the coast, transporting our commandos back and forth, also engaged in combat with small German vessels and small anti-aircraft gunboats. From beginning to end, our commandos carried out their mission without hindrance. Our forces utilized various automatic weapons, maintaining an active position until the mission was completed and they safely withdrew. In this battle, our casualties were few. A one-mile-long defense line on the enemy side was threatened by our forces. The troops on our side were composed of elite soldiers drawn from the 53rd Regiment.

German Supreme Headquarters, 23rd (Haitong) – This afternoon's German military report stated that several German patrol boats made contact with several British motor torpedo boats in the English Channel last night. Enemy boats were damaged. On the same night, German minesweepers engaged with British motor torpedo boats near Boulogne, sinking one enemy boat and damaging two. Our boats returned safely to their original defense.

Berlin, 23rd (Haitong) – It was announced here last night that German minesweepers engaged British fast boats off the coast of Boulogne in France yesterday morning, sinking one enemy fast boat. Other details are unknown.

Berlin, 22nd (Allied News Agency) – Regarding the British naval attack on Boulogne in northeastern France, the German News Agency has confirmed this. The German military has also acknowledged it, but stated that the attacking British forces were heavily damaged and retreated due to the counterattack of the German defenders. It was also stated that when British forces attempted to land south of Boulogne on the morning of the 22nd, they were discovered and heavily bombarded by the German defenders. The British forces suffered heavy losses and abandoned their weapons to board their ships and escape under a smoke screen.

Rome, 23rd (Haitong) – Guida stated in yesterday's "Italian Voice" that if the United Kingdom and the United States wish to establish a second front against the Axis powers in Europe, they will need 500,000 troops. Therefore, when the United Kingdom and the United States implement this plan, they will lose half of their ships. Consequently, the London War Committee is unable to engage in this endeavor. The United Kingdom and the United States are facing increasingly acute transportation difficulties. Therefore, American Lend-Lease Commissioner Hopkins suggested merging the management of British and American ships. This will undoubtedly deal another blow to British maritime prestige.

### Lenin Monument Unveiled; Maisky Delivers Speech; War Said to Be Decisive This Year; German Offensive in the Kalinin Region

Stockholm, Sweden, 23rd (Haitong) – When the Lenin monument was unveiled in London yesterday, Soviet Ambassador to the United Kingdom Maisky delivered a speech stating that the war could be decided this year. After the Soviet Union achieves victory, humanity will see the dawn.

German Supreme Headquarters, 23rd (Haitong) – This afternoon's German military report stated that German forces on the Eastern European front are advancing smoothly. Soviet forces attacking in the central and northern sectors have failed. Our fighter groups heavily bombed major armaments factories in Stalinogorsk last night, hitting several targets and causing explosions and fires. Port facilities in Murmansk were attacked by air and sustained damage. After ten days of fierce fighting in Karelia, Finnish forces repelled enemy attacks as many as 150 times. Soviet forces suffered 14,000 casualties, and many were captured, with countless losses of military supplies and equipment.

Moscow, 23rd (Reuters) – The Soviet Information Bureau's midday supplementary communiqué stated that German infantry, accompanied by tanks, attacking in the Kalinin front sector were repeatedly repelled. In a German-occupied area of the Kalinin region, Soviet guerrillas repeatedly attacked German troops stationed there. Soviet tanks also stormed into a German-occupied village in a certain area, destroying several sentry posts. Today's Soviet communiqué only stated, "On the night of April 22nd, no major events occurred on the front line."

Moscow, 23rd (Reuters) – Soviet authorities announced at midnight yesterday that Soviet ships had sunk a German oil tanker and a troop transport in the Barents Sea.

Fierce Fighting in the Svir River Area

Helsinki, Finland, 23rd (Haitong) – Finnish military reports stated that the Soviet offensive in Olonets has now completely stalled. In the past two weeks, Soviet forces have repeatedly attempted to break through the Finnish lines in Olonets, but all attempts have been thwarted by our defending forces. From April 9th to the present, Soviet forces have launched 150 attacks, all of which have been repelled. Enemy forces in the central sector broke into our lines, but were immediately counterattacked and encircled by our forces. On the 21st, a large number of enemy forces were annihilated, approximately 2,000 men, including the commander of the Soviet 536th Regiment and many officers. The air force also participated in the operation at that time. The Soviet 114th Division attacked our lines in the central sector, losing 5,600 soldiers. Our forces also seized a large amount of enemy weaponry. Finnish casualties numbered approximately 440 men.

Stockholm, Sweden, 22nd (Havas) – According to front-line reports from Finland, unprecedented fierce fighting has been taking place in the Svir River area in recent days.

### All American Residents in Shanghai's Consular District Registered for Evacuation; Registration for British Residents Also Underway; American Diplomatic Personnel and the Press Register Separately with the Swiss Consulate

This city's American Resident Registration Office has learned that approximately 250 American residents in Shanghai, including foreigners married to American citizens, have nearly all registered in order to return to the United States according to the plan prepared by the relevant government.

Ninety Percent of Applications Have Arrived

The Shanghai American Consulate District includes Suzhou, Hangzhou, and other nearby counties. A total of 1,250 American residents in this district have already registered. Only approximately 150 American residents in more remote areas remain to apply for registration. It is expected that their applications will arrive in Shanghai soon, and there are very few American residents in Shanghai's urban area who have not yet registered.

British Resident Registration Cards Have Been Issued

As for the registration of British residents who wish to return, this is currently being accelerated, but it is still in its initial stages. The British Resident Registration Office has issued a large number of registration cards, some of which have already been filled out and returned. However, it is difficult to estimate the extent to which British residents are responding to this. At the same time, it is heard that the first batch of American residents from other locations, who arrived here a few days ago, have found accommodation in the former American school building, and some are residing in American apartments in this city. The aforementioned figures for American resident registration do not include diplomatic consular staff or the press, as they have registered separately with the Swiss Consulate General and will receive priority for repatriation.

### Unemployed White Russian Steals, Arrested, Attempts Suicide by Slitting Left Wrist with a Razor Blade

The English-language Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury reports that an unemployed White Russian, Kosnajeff, was arrested for jointly stealing clothing worth approximately 3,500 yuan. Knowing that his crime was obvious and that he could not escape severe punishment, he attempted suicide while being interrogated by the police. The suspect, aged 25, is currently being treated at the police hospital. He confessed during the interrogation that he had stolen clothing worth up to 3,500 yuan. He then suddenly used a razor blade to violently cut his left wrist, seemingly attempting suicide. His accomplice, also a White Russian named Afanasiev, was brought for questioning yesterday morning, but the hearing was postponed because the first defendant was unable to attend. Both defendants confessed during the interrogation that they had gone to the residence of a German expatriate, Mr. Toman, at 12 Lane 599, Tungshan Road, on the night of the 14th of this month, broken the lock, and entered the house. They then entered the cloakroom and stole various types of clothing before fleeing. They later pawned the clothing at a pawnshop in the French Concession and spent the cash. When the plaintiff returned home, he discovered that the lock on the door had been broken and immediately reported it to the police. After investigation by police detectives, several pieces of Chinese clothing suspected of being stolen were found in two pawnshops in the French Concession. The plaintiff was immediately instructed to identify the clothing, which he confirmed as belonging to him. The police then conducted a search and finally arrested the two defendants separately at two locations on Yuanfang Road. When the police interrogated the other defendant, Kosnajeff, who was addicted to heroin, suddenly requested permission to go to the restroom. After being led to the restroom, the defendant suddenly pulled out a concealed safety razor blade and violently stabbed his left wrist with it. The officer guarding him immediately called for help and dragged him out of the restroom, bandaging the wound and sending him to the police hospital. It is said that the injury is not serious and that he will need to remain in the hospital for about seven days before being sent to court for trial.

### Male Corpse Found; Apparently Shot

In front of the Continental Hotel at 69 Rue Chiao-kaching, a middle-aged man was suddenly found dead at half past eleven last night.

The corpse was wearing a gray serge robe, was well-built, and had more than 40 yuan in legal tender and a pawn ticket in his pocket. He appeared to be a member of high society. The police precinct immediately transported the corpse to the morgue for examination and ordered detectives to investigate the identity of the deceased. It is now known that the deceased was named Li Cheng-kung and may have been beaten to death. The case is still under investigation by the police.

### Housing Subletting License Management Office Urges Collection of Landlord Licenses; Applications Reach Over 60,000, but Only 20,000 Licenses Issued

The Public Concession’s Housing Subletting Licenses have been issued for only 20,000 units, which is quite surprising. However, the number of applications requested by sub-landlords has reached 60,000. Based on this, it is estimated that many have not yet collected their licenses. In addition to dispatching personnel to begin investigations, the office hopes that those who have not yet collected their licenses will do so as soon as possible to avoid penalties. The Public Concession’s Housing Subletting License Management Office has begun dispatching personnel to the western district, where residents are most concentrated, to investigate sub-landlords who have neglected to collect their licenses. If such situations are found, they will be ordered to collect the licenses from the issuing office within three days. The deadline for these licenses is the end of this month, which is fast approaching, and further delays or hesitations will not be tolerated. Here are the license issuance numbers for the past two days: on the 21st, 313 licenses were issued in the Central District, 657 in the Western District, 326 in the Northern District, and 372 in the Eastern District, totaling 1,663 licenses. On the 22nd, 357 licenses were issued in the Central District, 57X in the Western District, 356 in the Northern District, and 326 in the Eastern District, totaling 1,653 licenses.

### Washington Orders Expansion of Scope to Aid Stranded American Nationals; Coordinated by Neutral Authorities and Community Groups

In order to provide widespread relief to American nationals who are experiencing economic hardship due to the war, the Washington government has requested that the governments of neutral countries responsible for acting on its behalf notify the relevant authorities in occupied territories to change the original relief measures, expand the scope, and benefit more impoverished nationals. In China, the order was relayed to Shanghai by the Swiss Consulate General on Tuesday (the 21st). Although the content of the order has not been officially announced, nor have the total amount of relief funds and the distribution method been disclosed, sources from foreign circles indicate that the original measure of providing impoverished families with a monthly relief fund of 1,000 yuan in Chinese currency will be replaced by the principle of determining the relief amount based on the number of people in the household. This matter is currently being handled by the Swiss Consulate General and the British Residents Association.

Shanghai Managed by Swiss Consulate

The financial assistance to American nationals began on March 11th. At that time, the Relief Finance Committee of the American Residents Association issued a circular to all American nationals in the city, stating that a relief fund had been established, jointly managed and distributed by the association and the Swiss Consulate General, to assist American nationals. Part of this fund was allocated by the American government and transferred through the Swiss authorities, and it also included donations from various parties in this city. Payments from the fund must be signed by both the Swiss Consul General and the American Residents Association to be valid. There are two forms of relief: provision of food and lodging, and loans. Currently, the American Residents Association and the American Red Cross have established dormitories and cafeterias at the original site of the American School on Route Petain to accommodate impoverished American nationals who have no place to live. The latter refers to the aforementioned method of lending each family 1,000 yuan in Chinese currency.

Strict Restrictions on Loans

The loan program has stricter restrictions. Only those whose livelihoods are difficult to maintain due to the war are eligible to apply for loans, and no withdrawals can be made without the approval of the Swiss Consul General and the American Association. The maximum amount is 1,000 yuan in Chinese currency per family per month. If the investigation reveals that the expenses are less than 1,000 yuan, the amount will be reduced accordingly. Furthermore, applicants for loans must provide a guarantee to repay the same amount in the future. The Relief Finance Committee of the American Residents Association has distributed "Economic Report Forms" to investigate the living conditions of American nationals staying in Shanghai, instructing all American nationals to fill them out and submit them for file review. Those who are truly in dire financial straits and urgently need loans must fill out a separate "Loan Application Form," and they can only receive the amount after it has been approved by the responsible personnel.

Funds Will Be Distributed Based on Population

However, the scope of this plan is small, and the number of beneficiaries is limited. Therefore, the Washington authorities have adopted new measures. All American nationals in occupied territories around the world can cooperate with local neutral country authorities and community groups to organize relief. This is not limited to China or Shanghai. In terms of implementation, the amount that each family should receive will be determined according to the population ratio. The minimum amount is for a single person, the amount for married persons will increase slightly, and the amount for those with children will be calculated proportionally based on historical loan records. This is fairer and more reasonable in effect. Detailed methods are currently being planned by the Swiss Consulate and the American Residents Association. The American Residents Association is now located at 51 Guangdong Road, 6th Floor. The president is Anderson, the representative of the American Red Cross in Shanghai, and the chairman of the Relief Finance Committee is Belin.

### Organization of Small-Capital Lending Office; Fundraising Goal of 50,000 Yuan

The China Moral Education Association on Tongfu Road in this city, recognizing the decline in industry and commerce and the increasing number of unemployed people, and fearing that they will become idle and eventually starve to death if relief is not provided promptly, has adopted a policy of addressing both the symptoms and the root causes. In addition to providing daily assistance to the weak and vulnerable, the association has recently organized a small-capital lending office to enable the general public to support themselves and avoid desperation or resorting to dangerous measures. They plan to first raise 50,000 yuan in national currency to provide opportunities for small-scale businesses, which can be applied for at any time. This will not only benefit the poor; those from all walks of life who wish to contribute can send their donations directly to the association.

### Embezzlement of Huge Sum from Bank of Taiwan; Police Recover Stolen Goods; Perpetrator is Bank Employee Huang Wei

On the 13th of last month, the Japanese Bank of Taiwan at 20 Jiujiang Road was fraudulently drawn upon, resulting in the theft of 40,000 yuan in military use checks. Subsequently, Wu Yaozu, a Chinese detective from the Central Police Station, arrested six employees of the bank suspected of involvement: Yang Songshou, Wang Amao, Lu Binghe, Dong Qiyong, Dong Yongquan, and Qian Hongen, detaining them for investigation. However, no concrete leads were obtained. Until yesterday, through Detective Wu's efforts, it was discovered that the case was perpetrated by Huang Wei, a Ningbo native working in the bank's correspondence department, in collusion with his younger brother, Huang Weiliang. Huang Weicheng was immediately detained, while Huang Weiliang had already fled to another port with 4,000 yuan in military checks and could not be apprehended. Subsequently, 36,000 yuan in stolen military checks were found at Huang's home at No. 5, Lane 1604, Avenue Haig, and confiscated. After investigation, it was determined that Yang Songshou and the other five individuals had no involvement, so they were all released.

### Epidemic Fevers in Shanghai (II)

— Physician Hu Qipeng

2. Relapsing Fever

Before 1937, this disease was rarely seen in Shanghai. However, due to the overcrowding of residents, poor sanitation, and the proliferation of fleas, lice, and bedbugs, it has suddenly become prevalent.

Etiology

This disease, also known as relapsing fever, is transmitted by body lice and bedbugs.

Symptoms

The disease develops twelve hours after infection, with a sudden onset of chills and fever. The body temperature rises rapidly to 40 degrees Celsius, often accompanied by sweating, and soreness in the waist and limbs. The high fever persists for six to seven days before suddenly dropping to normal within a few hours, accompanied by profuse sweating. Approximately seven days after the fever subsides, the patient experiences a recurrence of chills and fever, with all the symptoms reappearing. After another seven days, the fever subsides again. This cycle often repeats two or three times or more, hence the name "seven-day fever." The severity of the illness depends on the number of recurrences. The diagnosis can be confirmed by examining the patient's blood under a microscope to detect the presence of the causative spirochetes.

Prevention

It is essential to maintain environmental cleanliness and eliminate bedbugs, fleas, and lice. Patients should be isolated, and their clothing, bedding, and rooms should be disinfected.

Treatment

Injections of small doses of arsenic preparations are a highly effective treatment for this disease.

3. Typhus

This disease has also been an important acute infectious disease in Shanghai in recent years. It often occurs in densely populated and unsanitary areas, such as prisons and military barracks, hence the historical names "jail fever" and "camp fever." Since 1938, due to population growth and a lack of attention to environmental hygiene, the number of lice has proliferated, and the number of patients has increased sharply. The epidemics in 1938 and 1940 were particularly severe, causing great harm to the city's residents.

Etiology

It is generally caused by a type of ultrafiltrable microorganism, but this has not been definitively determined. However, its contact transmissibility is very high, so many doctors and nurses have been infected while treating this disease. The vectors for the transmission of the virus are body lice and head lice.

Symptoms

The onset of the disease is often sudden. Initially, the patient experiences chills, and the body temperature rises from the onset, reaching above 40 degrees Celsius by the second or third day, remaining high. Around the twelfth or fourteenth day, the disease reaches its peak. At this time, the body temperature drops to normal within one or two days. In severe cases, the body temperature rises to above 42 degrees Celsius before death. Most patients develop an initial rash on the abdomen and upper chest between the third and fifth days of illness, followed by rapid spread to the limbs and face within two or three days, or even completely. The severity of mental symptoms, such as coma and delirium, can be considered a unique characteristic of this disease, more pronounced than other fevers. The diagnosis of this disease can be confirmed by performing a serological reaction test on the patient's blood.

Prevention

The most important method is to reduce the number of lice to eliminate the vector for the transmission of the virus. Pay attention to the cleanliness of clothing and bedding to prevent the breeding of lice. Patients who have already developed the disease must be absolutely isolated, and their furniture, clothing, and other items must be thoroughly disinfected.

Treatment

There is currently no specific medicine for this disease. Treatment is limited to addressing the symptoms. Multiple antipyretics should not be taken, as they are ineffective and can weaken the patient's heart. In recent years, a new treatment for this disease has been developed in the medical community, which involves injecting the blood of recovered patients into infected patients, often with remarkable results. This is a form of serum therapy.

4. Typhoid Fever

This disease is familiar to the public, but unfortunately, most people do not understand the main causes of the disease or believe in preventive measures, resulting in a large number of patients and making it a perennial epidemic fever in Shanghai. Furthermore, many patients die due to random medication and misdiagnosis. According to the statistics of acute infectious diseases from the Municipal Health Bureau, the number of patients and deaths from this disease are the highest.

Etiology

It is caused by infection with Salmonella typhi. Because the damage caused by the disease is in the intestines, it is also known as enteric fever. The spread of the bacteria is due to direct or indirect contamination of fingers and food by the patient's feces or by flies carrying and spreading the bacteria. The prevalence of this disease is mainly due to the pollution of ditches, the mess of fecal residue, and the poor environmental conditions.

Symptoms

In the early stage of infection (incubation period), the patient feels headaches and fatigue. The illness progresses gradually, and the fever rises gradually, increasing by about half a degree to one degree each night. By the end of the first week, it rises directly to between 39.5 and 40 degrees Celsius, remaining high. All the symptoms of fever appear, such as a thick and greasy tongue coating, mental dullness, and a blank expression. High fever can even lead to coma and delirium. At this time, the symptoms worsen, often leading to death due to involvement of the nervous system. Otherwise, after another week, the fever gradually subsides, beginning the third week. During this period, complications of the heart and lungs, or worsening delirium and muscle tremors, are all dangerous signs. The most terrifying complication is intestinal perforation and bleeding. By the fourth week, the patient shows signs of gradual recovery. However, the symptoms of typhoid fever are very complex, and the above is a general summary. In short, the severity of the illness, the presence of complications, and whether or not the illness is present depend on the patient's usual physical strength and the appropriateness of the treatment and care provided by the doctor and caregiver. This disease can also be definitively diagnosed by testing the blood.

Prevention

Vaccination against typhoid fever is the only reliable method for preventing this disease. Preventing the spread of the virus from patients and eliminating flies are also important measures.

Treatment

To date, there are no specific drugs to shorten the course of the disease, so patients should not be impatient and should not randomly take antipyretics to avoid weakening the patient's heart. They should only follow the doctor's instructions, take careful care, and keep the patient absolutely quiet to prevent dangerous conditions such as intestinal perforation and bleeding. Special attention should be paid to providing the diet prescribed by the doctor. It should be known that in the past, doctors often caused the death of patients due to overly strict dietary restrictions, resulting in a lack of energy and exhaustion due to prolonged illness.

Conclusion

The symptoms of all the above-mentioned diseases only describe the patient's subjective symptoms and what the general public can pay attention to. Other symptoms and those that the doctor can diagnose are omitted.

The occurrence of various infectious diseases is caused by the bacteria or microorganisms that cause the disease, but not all those infected will develop the disease. This is due to the different physical strength and resistance of each person. Those with weak resistance are easily exploited by bacteria. Therefore, all factors that can reduce the body's resistance at this time, such as overeating, overdrinking, seeking coolness, overheating, physical and mental fatigue, depression, and anger, are all remote causes of the disease. Therefore, in order to prevent the invasion of epidemic diseases, in addition to those responsible for public health actively improving health facilities, personal physical and mental hygiene must be given attention.

Postscript

Prevention and treatment of epidemics require medication, and the source of medicine here, although environment is affected, the actual inventory is not necessarily insufficient. It is regrettable that medicines have now become goods for market speculation and hoarding, resulting in a sudden increase in market prices by hundreds of times. As a result, patients are fearful of having medical treatment but no medicine. If this continues, patients will die and the infection will spread. If a severe epidemic occurs, those who hoard medicine will also suffer the consequences. This is terrible! Therefore, I deeply hope that the authorities will take action against those who hoard medicine to value human life. This would be fortunate for the entire city. (End)

### Frenzied Buying; Sponge Gold Reaches Unprecedented High Price; 23,450 Yuan

Yesterday's cash market for sponge gold experienced a sharp rise followed by a correction, once surging past 23,000 yuan and breaking the all-time high record of 23,100 yuan on October 31 of last year, reaching an unprecedented peak of 23,450 yuan. The market sentiment changed from firm to stable as investors in the city accumulated positions earlier, followed by an influx of Tianjin buyers. From the morning, the price per tael (ten liang) rose sharply amid consistent buying pressure. The initial transaction price was already 1,800 yuan higher, at 22,500 yuan. Further gains of 950 yuan were made in the buying frenzy from cash houses, gold shops, and securities houses, breaking through 23,000 yuan and reaching a high price of 23,450 yuan. The market was extremely chaotic. The Tianjin buyers then instructed securities houses to sell, and some retail longs also sold, leading to a decline of 1,300 yuan. At 11:30 AM, the price rose to 22,150 yuan. There were subsequent transactions, and the price stabilized, rising by 1,450 yuan compared to the previous day's price. It has risen for four consecutive days, with a total increase of 4,050 yuan. The daily range was 1,300 yuan, and the transaction volume was very high.

The selling price of gold jewelry in gold shops was initially raised by 200 yuan by both Da Xin and other shops, reaching a high price of 3,400 yuan per tael. Later, it fell back 100 yuan to 2,300 yuan (purchases reduced by 200 yuan), rising by 100 yuan. Silver was quoted at 18 yuan. The black market price surged to 15.5 yuan with buyers. Silver coins rose to 9.90 yuan each, also a significant increase.

Yesterday's call loan rate at the Money Dealers Association was still quoted at 1.3%, and the discount rate for drafts was only 7 or 8 yuan per thousand. The price difference between old and new legal tender for drafts was 0.29 and 0.31 yuan, and for cash was 0.29 yuan.

### Gold Pound Rises Again by Ten Dollars

Yesterday in the foreign exchange market, the British and American gold pounds rose again by ten dollars. The former rose to four hundred and eighty dollars, and the latter reached four hundred and ninety dollars. American dollar notes remained stable, priced at thirty-five or six dollars. Hong Kong notes remained at five dollars, with large notes reduced by ten cents. Military scrip opened in the morning at seven dollars and twenty-five cents, then retreated to seven dollars and fifteen cents, and finally settled at seven dollars and eighteen cents, a decrease of seven cents from the previous day.

### Public Bond Strength Versus Spot Goods: A Seemingly Head-to-Head Clash Whose Gains and Losses Are Difficult to Predict for the Moment

Yesterday, in the grey market for public bonds, due to the strong appetite of the financial community, although the original source's shipments were extremely abundant, exceeding one million dollars, the volume of purchases exceeded it. The strength of the buyers competed with the spot goods, seemingly clashing head-to-head. As a result, the bullish faction temporarily claimed victory, which was beyond the expectations of most people. Class A bonds even broke through the seventy-dollar mark. However, the closing prices of three dollars and twenty cents for Class C and seven dollars and twenty cents for Class D were both unsubstantiated. The future still holds potential competition. There were indeed spot goods being sold, and there was indeed strength behind the buying. Whether the spot goods exceeded the strength or the strength exceeded the spot goods was difficult for outsiders to predict. Therefore, those on the sidelines could only wave flags and shout, already enveloped by the momentum of the realists. Realong of the northern gang bought 400,000, Chengkang and Tongshun bought 600,000, Hongxing, Qianyi, Jiufu, Dazhong, and Xiekang each bought over 100,000, and Runde, Tongyuan, Hongda, Zhenhua, Jiufeng, Shunli, Changfeng, and Yitai all absorbed in small quantities. The atmosphere in the market was high, but Tongli, Xuyuan, and Tongkang sold off spot goods, maintaining a calm attitude, selling a total of about 800,000 to 900,000. The Lianhe bulls also took advantage of the high prices to sell off, amounting to 300,000 to 400,000. As for Wuhe, Gongmao, Renfeng, Yongkang, Xinji, Hu Heji, Qingcheng, Lemao, Yongchang, and Hengyu, they only engaged in a few transactions. However, there were also quite a few who entered and exited intermittently, showing a favorable trend. However, at this point, it had entered a power struggle, and it could not be judged by ordinary theories. As a result, the market price continued to rise by five to seven cents to one dollar and fifty cents, with a turnover of one million eight hundred to ninety thousand dollars. A simple table is listed below:

### Foreign Stocks: Profit-Taking Closes

Yesterday, foreign stocks, due to the approaching settlement period, were sold off by the bulls, causing prices to first rise and then fall.

### New Shorts and Longs Rise Together Temporarily: Double Horse Yarn Takes a Sharp Turn Downward

The cotton yarn market started strong but then weakened. This was because continuous price increases triggered profit-taking, so the supply of chips loosened slightly, and the market trended downwards. However, the spot supply remained tight. 42-count Blue Phoenix 13,550 yuan to 13,350 yuan, closing price 13,400 yuan; 42-count Bao Guang 13,100 yuan; 42-count Shui Yue 13,000 yuan; 40-count Ri Guang 12,000 yuan; 40-count Jin Cheng 11,400 yuan; 32-count Blue Phoenix 12,100 yuan; 32-count Xian Tao 12,400 yuan; 60-count Blue Phoenix 22,900 yuan; 20-count Blue Phoenix 7,250 yuan to 7,000 yuan; 20-count Yue Qin 6,250 yuan to 6,300 yuan; 20-count Shui Yue 6,300 yuan to 6,350 yuan; 20-count Feng Nian 6,600 yuan to 6,550 yuan; 20-count Xian Tao 6,200 yuan to 6,250 yuan; 20-count Xian He 6,400 yuan; 20-count Double Horse 6,090 yuan to 6,200 yuan, closing price 6,000 yuan; 20-count Double Globe 6,240 yuan; 20-count Ri Guang 6,700 yuan to 6,800 yuan; 18-count Zhi Nü 6,350 yuan; 16-count Jin Qiao 6,000 yuan; 16-count Hong Kui 5,925 yuan; 60-count Double Globe 6,100 yuan; 6-count Xiong Feng 6,100 yuan; 10-count Red Double Horse 4,870 yuan; 10-count Red Bao Yi 4,560 yuan; 10-count Double Globe 4,700 yuan; 10-count Tong Zi Jun 4,750 yuan to 4,830 yuan. 20-count Double Horse factory opened higher, priced at 5,120 yuan. At this time, the speculation was quite tight, rising directly to 5,270 yuan. Subsequently, the price jumped wildly, causing long positions to close out and new sellers to become active. The market then turned downwards, breaking the 5,000 yuan mark before closing, with a low price seen at 4,920 yuan, closing price 4,950 yuan.

### Eastern Piece Goods: Rapid Rise and Fall, Quite Startling

Yesterday, the Eastern cloth market saw a rapid rise and fall, followed by another rise. Fine cloth fluctuated by more than ten yuan. 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth new order opened in the morning at 271 yuan, reaching a high of 273.5 yuan. Then, due to the decline in Double Horse yarn, retail investors rushed to sell, with the lowest price seen at 257 yuan. The afternoon closed again, rising to 260.5 yuan. The after-market opened around 261 yuan, rising to 64 yuan, and the evening closed at 263.5 yuan, a decrease of 2.5 yuan from the previous day. Other mid-range fine cloths remained tight due to brokers' searches. Cai Qiu 240 yuan, Fei Yu 236 yuan. The red order for Four Gentlemen broadcloth also fluctuated greatly, with the highest peak at 9.3 yuan, the lowest at 8.5 yuan, and the evening closing at 8.8 yuan.

### Rainproof Cloth Rises Opportunistically

Raincoat cloth is becoming more active due to the approaching rainy season. However, because other imported raincoat materials have mostly disappeared, rainproof cloth has emerged in response. Its price is considered cheap and its quality is still good, so its sales have expanded. The Golden Bear brand is selling particularly well, with orders and spot sales very busy and overwhelmed. Yesterday, Golden Bear brand rainproof cloth was sold at 21 yuan per yard of Old French currency, Pou Polin at 14 yuan, and improved rain overalls sold at 175 yuan.

Spring and Autumn

### I am a Five-Cent Coin

— Han Fu

I am a five-cent coin. One day, I ended up in the pocket of a Western-dressed young man. He disliked me very much and didn't respect me as much as the ten-yuan and five-yuan bills in his pocket. He tried to use me many times, but each time he was rejected. Later, he used me to pay a newspaper vendor, and I clearly heard the newspaper vendor say, "Sir, please exchange for a larger bill." So he unhappily put me back in his pocket. Finally, he used me on the tram.

The ticket seller on the tram immediately gave me as change to a middle-aged man. The middle-aged man shook his head. "This thing is really annoying." I was really surprised. Why am I disliked everywhere? Am I not still a five-cent coin?

That man got off the tram. A beggar asked him for money and followed him for dozens of steps. That man then gave me to the beggar. As soon as the beggar saw me, he immediately said, "Sir, please do a good deed and exchange for a larger bill. Five cents is really useless." The man put me back in his pocket. Alas! I had never encountered such a thing before. Even a beggar belittled me like this. Later, the man hired a rickshaw. After being pulled to his destination, the man gave me to the rickshaw puller, "I'll give you an extra five cents." Who knew that the rickshaw puller would abandon me on the ground, muttering in his mouth, "Do you think I'm a beggar! Insult!" But the man didn't pick me up and left. A gust of wind blew me around on the ground. Many people saw me, but no one paid any attention to me. Finally, I was blown into the gutter.

When I was first minted, I was so popular. People fought over me, and I was so impressive. I really felt like I was a lucky coin. I remember one time, a woman gave me to a beggar, and the beggar thanked her many times. Another time, a child asked his mother for five cents, and the mother said, "Five cents? What do you need so much money for?" Another time... In short, at that time, people valued me very much. Why do they look down on me so much now? Is it because old jewels are worthless? But I'm not old. Alas, God knows! In such a short time, things have changed so much!

### The "Firestarter" Incident

— Xin Fo Ju Shi

If you haven't been to Beiping, you wouldn't know what "firestarter" is. If you ask, a ragpicker girl will grin and say:

"Oh, silly, you don't even know what a firestarter is. Hah, let me ask you, when the sun is gone, don't you need to light a lamp? What do you use to light it?"

From this, you can know that "firestarter" is actually the "automatic fire" we use every day, officially called "matches," which were originally used specifically for lighting lamps.

Since I learned to smoke cigarettes more than twenty years ago, matches have become a constant companion in my pockets. To be fashionable, I've also used lighters, but because they often run out of oil, flints, and the springs malfunction, etc., I find them annoying; therefore, for complete convenience, I have to keep a box of matches in addition to the lighter.

Last year, when cigarette prices rose, smart people who knew how to save money switched to using pipes; and with a pipe dangling from their mouths, they felt quite "gentlemanly," so I also bought a "3B" that I found in a used goods store. At the end of the month, after doing the calculations, although I was using high-quality foreign tobacco, its consumption was only one-third of that of Great Britain brand cigarettes. The most worrying point was the match problem, which averaged fifteen boxes per month. Fortunately, at that time, each box only cost twelve cents, which was still affordable.

But in the last two months, the situation has become more and more serious. The price of matches has been rising almost every minute: twenty-five cents, thirty-five cents, seventy cents, eighty cents, ninety cents, one dollar... one dollar and twenty cents! Compared to three or four years ago, it's also more than one hundred and eighty times higher!

This is a threat. Friends who smoke pipes probably all regard the rising price of matches as a very big "incident."

The most regrettable thing is that the Swedish match king committed suicide so impetuously. If he had patiently waited until today, wouldn't this suicide incident have been avoidable? Why? I heard that the reason he took this drastic measure was because of a cash flow problem. But at that time, each box of matches only cost one or two copper coins. Even if he only had ten million in assets and owed two hundred million, by the end of last year, when matches were selling for fifteen cents a box, his assets would have increased to four hundred and fifty million. Would he still need to commit suicide? Nowadays, at one dollar and twenty cents a box, as long as he is willing to provide compensation, I think there are many people who would be willing to commit suicide for him!

### Aphorisms

— Guo Zhen

A person who cannot overcome fear every day has not yet thoroughly understood the practical meaning of life.

E Mao Sun

We should have the confidence that truth can accomplish any undertaking, and in this faith, bravely take on the responsibilities we should fulfill.

Lincoln

Only families with children can understand the meaning of life.

Yi Mao Zheng

Every day is the best day of the year.

### The Gambler's Philosophy

— Xiao Sheng

It is said that there is a "expert" in betting on jai alai, who spends his days in the jai alai court, meticulously studying, wanting to study a scientific method to obtain a guaranteed victory in betting on jai alai. Saying it's a "scientific method" is not an exaggeration. Ordinary people always have some superstitious ideas about gambling. For example, if someone asks to borrow money before gambling, they will definitely lose, etc. The ladies and wives who play flower clubs are even willing to bare their bodies in the wilderness and ask for dreams at the graves of ancestors. This "expert's" scientific method, however, involves detailed records of the court's climate, the players' physical condition, the quality of their skills, as well as the distinction between "long shots" and "favorites," and the relationship between "closing bets" and "consecutive wins," and he verifies them with the daily results. However, whether he can create a theory of guaranteed victory in jai alai, just as Watt invented steam power after seeing water boiling in a pot, or Newton discovered the law of gravity after seeing an apple falling from a tree without wind, has not been confirmed to this day; perhaps it is just like the traditional concept of a secret ancestral formula, which is only passed on to daughters-in-law and not daughters, as a "family treasure" for all ages.

Facts tell us: "If gambling could guarantee victory, it would be the only business in the world." Even if this "expert" is indeed the exception to the exception, he is only a "sole winner" among five million people.

Recently, slot machines have become popular in various cafes. At first, I thought they were just a pastime for those with leisure. Trying your luck while waiting impatiently, the occasional "jackpot" is just for fun, who would think of these few dozen copper coins as a "sure thing"? However, it is not so. The minds of modern people are indeed very complex. The "slot machine king" invented this "gambling tool" using scientific methods, and someone is using scientific methods to explore "gambling techniques." For example, how many "flowers" are on a tape, and after how many cycles does the "jackpot" come out once, which can be solved using "algebra." So these "mathematicians" imitate the method of "waiting for a rabbit to run into a tree," hunting for their chances of victory after others have been "eaten" several times. Naturally, there is a chance for the "jackpot" to come out, but the number of times is not as accurate as the algebraic answer - and then they discover the psychological effects of the "pull" being heavy or light, the "kill" being fast or slow, etc., and eventually they are "eaten" countless times, and it is unfathomable.

Is this a theory that science is useless? No one dares to jump to conclusions lightly.

But finally, someone came out to answer. He said: Gambling is just gambling; if you have the courage to gamble, then don't bother with gains and losses; coming up with clever tricks and acting smart is not deceiving others, but deceiving yourself!

This is also a frank and quick-spoken statement. At the same time, everything can be viewed in this way.

### Sharing the Same Boat Through Wind and Rain

— He Jia Zhi

(Two) Guests Arrive

Wei Cheng shook his head and said, "Guo Fang, do you think our clothes are suitable for visiting people's homes? I am very grateful that you came and that your brother asked you to bring a message. Since you have come, then make yourself at home, don't rush back. You came by car, so tell the driver to go back. If you want to go back in a day or two, you can hire a long car here." Before Wei Cheng finished speaking, Madam Ye Er, supported by Xi Que, came out. Wei Cheng quickly told Guo Fang who she was, and also told Madam Ye Er who Guo Fang was, mentioning Guo Qi along the way. Madam Ye Er naturally had some polite words to say, and also said that what she hoped for most now was that Wei Cheng's classmates or childhood friends would visit Wei Cheng, so that Wei Cheng's heart, which was suffocated in his chest, could be comforted, and his body would not be affected.

Wei Cheng led Guo Fang to visit every room, and also went to the Shuangmei Study to see the portrait of Wei Cheng's father, Duke Aitang. Wei Cheng told her that in the future he would hang his late mother's portrait together with his late father's portrait. Guo Fang glanced through the ancient books hidden on the bookshelf and felt that Ji Cheng was from a scholarly family, no wonder his character and behavior were so well-cultivated. She asked, "You have suffered a great misfortune, I suppose you will give up studying?" Cheng said, "Yes. I only hate my bad luck, studying will be hit hard. You siblings are better off." Guo Fang said, "It's not a matter of being better off, even if I go to school, I understand that I will still not accomplish anything in the future. It's better for your family to have these books, which is exactly what they say, 'possessing what, possessing a hundred cities,' the future achievements are immeasurable." Wei Cheng said, "We talked about getting rid of all humility and hypocrisy on the boat, Guo Fang, why are you saying these things again? You are flattering me." Guo Fang said, "This is not flattery, it is a kind of hope for me. If you don't believe me, when we correspond in the future, the words in my heart will unconsciously flow out."

### "Condemnation" and "Crime"

— Fei Hui

When a person does something that they think they shouldn't do, their heart will deeply feel "condemnation." This after-the-fact "condemnation" is not an external sanction, but a kind of inner self-reproach; therefore, from the perspective of the person involved, it should be very painful, so he resolutely decides that he will never do it again next time.

But as time goes by, the feeling of "condemnation" fades away, so under a certain irresistible temptation, he commits the offense again for the second time. Although "condemnation" will arise again in the same way after the fact, and because of self-reproach, he may muster even greater courage to decide - he really won't do it again in the future. However, in fact, this unfulfilled decision has unknowingly become a kind of hypocrisy and deception towards himself; so, under his unshakeable will, it is the third time, the fourth time... until he does it continuously without any feeling. Although the number of times of "condemnation" after the fact will not be less than what he has done, this "condemnation" has become "numb" to him, and the "condemnation" after "numbness" will no longer have any effect.

If you go to the prison to visit every prisoner, they would not have had several times of inner condemnation before the last crime, but he was eventually imprisoned for committing a crime.

### Matches

— Jing Mei

The Four Books say that if you knock on someone's door in the dark night to ask for water or fire, no one will refuse. Today, it seems difficult to ask someone for a single match, which shows that the social situation is different from what it used to be. But I know that our country has made matches as early as. A certain notebook says: "Split the , quench it with sulfur to make fire tools." It is noted that is the name of miscellaneous wood, sulfur is sulfur, meaning to analyze the and quench sulfur at its end, according to which we know it is the matches of that year. Later, due to the import of foreign matches, this old method has been eliminated. Also, there were no matches in Beiping in the early years. There was something called a "fire starter," which is today's match. When foreign matches were imported into Beiping, people generally called them "foreign fire starters." Even now, there are still poor people calling out in the streets of Beiping, "Exchanging for foreign fire starters," that is, exchanging waste paper and rags for one or two boxes of matches. Also, there are two place names in Beiping: one outside Qianmen and one in the East City, both named "Fire Starter Alley," which I think was where matches were made at that time. It is a pity that the old method has been lost. If someone knows this old method of making matches, it can also be a way to remedy the "match shortage."

### Shoes

— Wen Zhen

I once heard a joke. Someone came up with a riddle: "One day I don't know, people don't know, the earth knows, I know, where is this thing going?" As a result, no one knew. So the man raised his foot high and said, "Here." It turned out that there was a hole in the sole of the shoe. Now there can't be many people who can get people to guess this riddle. Really, a pair of cloth shoes costs thirty to fifty yuan or so, and buying a pair of leather shoes costs one hundred and sixty yuan! That is, even putting on front and back soles costs twenty or thirty yuan!

### Scene

— Man Qi

"Mom! Something bad happened! It's leaking! Leaking…"

Heavy rain was pouring down, impacting the dilapidated tiles on the roof.

"What? Which side?" The mother looked at the roof, trying to find the place where the water was dripping.

"That corner! Hurry up and get…"

"Hurry up and get it! Basin, foot tub, hurry!" the mother shouted loudly.

"Mom! It's also leaking over there! Mom! You hurry up and move things! The basin and foot tub are also leaking!" a younger child shouted.

"God! Why do you want to be against us!"

The heavy rain was still pouring down, impacting the dilapidated tiles on the roof.
