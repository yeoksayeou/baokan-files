### British Forces Attack Again: Fierce Fighting Resumes in North Africa; Italian Forces Reinforce Tripoli Port; Prince Richwo's Sons Killed in Action

London, 1st - Havas: Official sources announced that the British Eighth Army on the Egyptian front launched a fierce attack on the Axis forces' positions on the previous day under the cover of intense artillery fire. They resumed their attack again yesterday morning.

Rome, 1st - Havas: The Italian High Command has just released a battle report stating that on the northern sector of the Egyptian front, British forces launched another offensive yesterday morning, immediately leading to fierce fighting.

Minister Aoki Issues Statement

In a statement issued before the ceremony began, he said: "The Greater East Asia Ministry was established today, and I am honored to be appointed as Minister. The purpose of establishing the Greater East Asia Ministry has been clearly stated by the government. This Greater East Asia War has the meaning of both war and construction. Therefore, the construction of Greater East Asia and the completion of the war are inseparable. In this construction war, we should manifest the founding spirit of Hakkō ichiu in East Asia, so that all countries and peoples in the Greater East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere can find their place. We will build a new order in East Asia based on justice. However, in order to achieve this goal, it is absolutely necessary to complete the victory and win the war. Therefore, we must rapidly increase and expand the Empire's war power. The government, therefore, in order to ensure that the planning of the Greater East Asia construction and the implementation of political affairs can closely cooperate with the High Command, must have a unified and comprehensive organization that can operate quickly and surely. The establishment of the Greater East Asia Ministry is in response to this urgent need. I deeply feel the importance of this mission and am determined to devote all my efforts to serving the public sincerely. Thanks to the loyalty and bravery of the soldiers of the Imperial Army, the Greater East Asia War has achieved brilliant results and established the foundation for victory. However, the Greater East Asia War and the construction of Greater East Asia are unprecedented undertakings. Therefore, it is necessary to strengthen cooperation with allied nations, and the people must unite firmly, with a spirit of perseverance, to devote all their efforts to their respective tasks in order to unleash the greatest power. Therefore, I will work closely with the countries of the Co-prosperity Sphere, such as China, Manchukuo, Thailand, and Vietnam, in accordance with the treaties concluded. At the same time, I sincerely hope that all allied nations will understand the true meaning of this Greater East Asia War and cooperate more in the construction of the new order in East Asia."

### Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs Reorganizes, Establishes Four Bureaus: Political Affairs, Commerce, etc.

Tokyo, 1st - Central News Agency: Due to the establishment of the Greater East Asia Ministry, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has recently reorganized its structure, establishing four bureaus: Political Affairs, Commerce, Treaties, and Investigation. The tasks of each bureau are: (1) "Political Affairs Bureau": Handles the diplomatic affairs of the former Europe-Asia and Americas Bureaus and six sections, and the Greater East Asia affairs that are not transferred to the Greater East Asia Ministry. Seven sections are newly established. The tasks of each section are: Section 1 (General Affairs), Section 2 (Greater East Asia), Section 3 (Soviet Union), Section 4 (Europe except Britain and the Soviet Union), Section 5 (British Mainland and Dominions), Section 6 (North America), and Section 7 (South America). Among them, the Chief of the First Section, who is directly assisting the Director in charge of planning all diplomatic policies and comprehensive investigations, and the Chief of the Second Section, who is responsible for liaison affairs with the Greater East Asia Ministry, bear the heaviest responsibility. Moreover, this newly established Political Affairs Bureau is responsible not only for the affairs of the East Asia region, but also for the promotion of all diplomatic matters worldwide, and is therefore the central department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. (2) "Commerce Bureau": Some of the political affairs within the bureau have been transferred to the Greater East Asia Ministry, so the organization has been reduced in size. It has now been reduced from six sections to three sections. (3) "Treaties Bureau": The organization has also been reduced in size. The previous three sections have been reduced to two sections. (4) "Investigation Bureau": Is the investigation agency of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. In the past, the Investigation Department had six sections, managing the collection and investigation of materials and information. To adapt to the simplification of administration, the new organization has reduced the six sections to four sections and has elevated the department to a bureau to enrich its content. The newly established Investigation Bureau has established a system of commissioned investigators for diplomatic agencies, and it has been decided that the new Investigation Bureau, Section 4, will manage and closely liaise with the Information Bureau and the First Section of the Political Affairs Bureau, and will be responsible for information and propaganda.

Tokyo, 1st - Central News Agency: The newly appointed Vice-Minister and Bureau Directors of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs have been announced as follows: Toshikazu Shigemitsu, Director of the Treaty Bureau, is appointed as Vice-Minister of Foreign Affairs; Shinichi Kamimura, Counselor of the Embassy, is appointed as Director of the Political Affairs Bureau; Yoshiro Ando, Director of the Europe-Asia Bureau, is appointed as Director of the Treaty Bureau; Yoshitaro Yamada, First Secretary of the Embassy, is appointed as Director of the Investigation Bureau; Nobuyuki Shibuzawa, Consul General and First Secretary of the Embassy, is appointed as Director of the Commerce Bureau.

### Intense German-Soviet Air Battles in Southern Regions of the Eastern Front; Underwater Bridges in the Volga River; Soviet Forces Continue to Reinforce Stalingrad

Berlin, 1st - Domei: Yesterday's fighting in southern Russia was characterized by intense air battles. General attention shifted from the Stalingrad area to the Nalchik area. Last night's news was that German-Romanian forces advancing from the Terek River annihilated two Soviet divisions. Today's reports indicate that German forces broke through the heavily defended Soviet defenses, but officials did not specify how far the German forces had advanced. Intense air battles occurred in this area and other areas in southern Russia. German forces shot down 28 Soviet planes and destroyed 150 trucks full of troops and war materiel. The most intense air battles occurred north of Stalingrad, where German aircraft bombed the Soviet forces still holding the factory district and the Soviet artillery units on the east bank of the Volga River.

Ankara, 1st - Domei: According to unconfirmed reports received here today, the Germans now have about eight small submarines in the Black Sea. These submarines are transported in sections from land to the Black Sea and assembled at the Black Sea port.

Somewhere on the Ukrainian Border, 31st - Havas: Although the Soviet Union is already experiencing freezing winds, the fighting on the Eastern Front is still very intense, especially in the Caucasus and Stalingrad regions. Regarding the battle of Stalingrad, according to neutral observers, the fact that the Red Army is still able to resist in the Stalingrad region is a "mystery of the age." The reason for this is that underwater bridges have been built in the Volga River, so the Red Army in Stalingrad is still able to receive supplies and reinforcements. As for the Caucasus front, the situation on each front is as follows: (1) In the Tuapse area, heavy rains have continued for days, and the German forces attempting to occupy the high mountains northwest of the city have had to switch to the defensive due to the continuous attacks of the Red Army. (2) In the Terek River basin, Axis forces continue to advance towards Dagestan, and the development of the battle is clearly favorable to the Axis forces. (3) In the Nalchik area, German forces are attempting to isolate the Red Army, cutting it off from its main forces, and it is understood that German-Romanian forces have continued to advance south of the city of Nalchik, but the Soviet Union has sent fresh troops to reinforce the area. (4) Fierce fighting broke out northeast of the city of Chervishevo, where German-Romanian forces attempted to break through the Red Army's positions and directly attack the Black Sea coast.

### Africa in the Midst of Shifting Winds: Egypt—The Second Gateway to the Center of the War (1)

In this season of holding chrysanthemums while feasting on crabs, just a cup in hand is enough to live a carefree, dreamlike existence. Why bother asking about world affairs! The leisurely Jin Dynasty figure, Bi Zhuo, put it well: "With a wine cup in my right hand and a crab claw in my left, adrift in a wine boat, that's enough for a lifetime..." What a romantic spirit!

Having finished eating crabs, why do most poets always focus on the pair of claws? Strolling through the streets, one often sees a jade hand painted with bright red nail polish, picking up a crab. Although the aim is to check whether it is male or female and plump, looking at that jade hand, constantly twitching, it seems to have some reservations. Afraid of what? It's still that pair of strong, powerful claws. For the sake of satisfying one's appetite, to have half of a nail-polished finger clipped off would not be worth it. Originally, a glance at this pair of large pincers is indeed somewhat startling.

Reading novels, one sees that a famous Song Dynasty general invented a "vise formation." This is clearly somewhat nonsensical; tigers never had pincers, it's just crab claws. However, in the hands of writers, these claws are described as even more fierce. Unexpectedly, today's "vise formation" has once again come to the fore. Glancing at the flames of war in Europe, one pincer has already extended to the vicinity of the Caucasus, and another pincer is already posturing to seize North Africa. In this season of holding crabs and admiring chrysanthemums, a glance at the crabs inevitably causes some alarm.

Coincidentally, among a group of children, some are Russian and some are British. During blackboard and chalk time, one accidentally asked: "Do you eat crabs?"

"Not much," the Russian children answered. "We like smoked fish and caviar."

"Have you seen crabs?"

"There are many on the streets now."

"Are you afraid of the crab claws?"

"No, as long as you move it gently, it will break off—first take a piece of wood or a piece of iron to let it clamp onto, then break it from behind with one stroke." The Russian children are truly cunning and mischievous.

"We are not afraid either," the British children also wanted to say something. "We can wear very thick leather gloves, not afraid of the claws. As long as we twist it like this, it will 'break'."

The flames of war in Europe, on the Caucasus front, may now be considered deadlocked and even stalled. Now let's talk about that pincer in North Africa, in the "Egypt-Watering Place."

To ask why the situation in Egypt is so tense, we must first point out the general shape of Africa. In the newspapers, we are now familiar with the names of several Black African countries. Libya—since the war began in North Africa, this name has been in our memory. There is also something called Dakar, which has recently become very lively. Fortunately, it only has three characters, which is still easy to remember. In addition, there is Madagascar, a large, cumbersome pile. If you are unwilling to pay attention to the current situation, no one is willing to bother with this trouble. Recently, there was suddenly the matter of American troops landing in a remote West African country, so we have to remember the name Liberia again. The bloody winds and clouds and the raging flames of war have given us the opportunity to recite place names. This is a humorous contribution of the great era. There is also Alexandria, which is remembered easily because of the name of Alexander the Great in history, so it doesn't feel unfamiliar.

The four place names listed above, invisibly encompass the eastern, western, southern, and northern shapes of Africa, all in a whole, strategic formation. The British advance into Madagascar is of course to maintain a shipping route in South Africa. Therefore, they disregarded the repeated ridicule of the Vichy government and forcibly occupied a part of it. The American landing in Liberia is a major event, with important strategic relations. We will reserve it here for the time being. In the special Liberia commentary in the next article, we will naturally point out a clear explanation. Regarding Dakar, it was briefly mentioned in the previous article "The Alaska Highway"! This place is only more than two thousand miles from Brazil in South America. The Americans are paying attention to it because of its relationship to escorting supplies. The Germans are paying attention to it because they want to build a railway through the Sahara Desert to reach the area directly, as a basis for attacking South America.

As for Alexandria, it now happens to be under the shadow of the German's right pincer. The importance of its military position can be imagined. If it is said that Egypt is the second gateway to the center of the war, then Alexandria is a key to that gateway.

Having briefly mentioned the overall situation of Africa above, we can now focus on studying the problem of this second gateway. Regarding the records of Egypt, this newspaper published an article "Egypt: A Discourse on Its Length and Breadth" in mid-June of this year, and another article "Mysterious Egypt" in late July. It is hoped that it is still in the readers' memory. Therefore, this article does not intend to mention its length, breadth, or mystery again, but only to briefly outline its situation from the midst of the flames of war.

Regarding the general situation of Egypt, if we acknowledge that it is a gateway to the center of the war, we can at least find three keys to this gateway: (1) the Egyptian-Sudanese highway for transportation and supply; (2) Alexandria, a military strongpoint; and (3) the Suez Canal, a passage between Europe and Asia. These three keys have different situations and different importance.

However, a country like Egypt, located in a corner of North Africa, seems to have no fire in the blood of its people. Since the era before Christ when it was ravaged by the Romans, up to the present day, after being repeatedly invaded and tormented, all military strength has simply fallen behind. Moreover, apart from the Nile River valley, which has some production, it does not seem to have any special treasures. We want to ask, why does the god of war repeatedly take care of her?

### Maintaining the Needs of Legitimate Consumers: Universal Sugar Purchase Method - Price Set, Limited to Five Yuan Per Person, Divided Areas, Sold Upon Presentation of Citizen Certificate

The Sugar Merchants Cooperative Business Office, in order to facilitate the purchase of sugar by legitimate consumers, avoid congestion, and prevent vendors from competing to buy for profit, has negotiated a universal sugar purchase method for consumers, which has been implemented since yesterday. It stipulates that all Category A retailers (South Goods Stores, etc.) will sell sugar upon presentation of a citizen certificate, limited to five yuan of Central Reserve Bank notes per person. After implementation, anyone not within the scope of allocation by the Shanghai Sugar Merchants Cooperative Business Office will no longer be able to buy and sell for profit in Shanghai. Then the entire sugar purchase panic will be eliminated.

Universal Sugar Purchase Method for Consumers

The cooperative business office's universal sugar purchase method for consumers: (1) When purchasing sugar, if the consumers reside in the Joint or French Concessions, they can purchase sugar from any retail sugar store in the two concessions upon presentation of their citizen certificate. Those residing in the Huxi, Hubei, Hongkou, or Zhabei sections can also purchase sugar from sugar stores in their respective sections upon presentation of their citizen certificate. They may not cross district lines. (2) Each retail sugar store should sell one-thirtieth of the total amount allocated in October and the amount of sugar previously in stock each day. To avoid the inconvenience of making small change, it is temporarily set at a limit of five yuan of Central Reserve Bank notes per person, including retail taxes. Sales time is from 10:00 AM to 4:00 PM. Sales will stop when the quota is met. If the amount of sugar sold is less than one-thirtieth, the remaining amount will be added to the next day's sales. This process will be repeated so that sugar is sold every day to achieve universality. (3) The price of sugar sold by each retail store should be clearly marked in a conspicuous place. If there are violations of regulations, such as raising prices, reducing quantities, or adulterating the sugar, or forcing customers to buy other items, the purchaser is allowed to report the matter to this office (address: No. 23, Tongyun Street, Yangxing Street, French Concession, telephone 83300) or report directly to the police authorities for investigation. (4) This office has resident supervisors and mobile inspectors, all of whom wear armbands issued by this office. If purchasers have any unclear situations, they can ask them at any time. (5) To make the retail price clear to consumers, the officially set price limit is specially listed.

Setting Price Limits to Eliminate the Black Market

After the promulgation of the new sugar sales method, all retailers should sell according to the price limits stipulated by the cooperative office. Absolutely no price increases or participation in black market transactions are allowed. Purchasers are allowed to report violations for investigation. It is also stated that Shanghai has a large supply of sugar, which is sufficient for long-term allocation. It is hoped that consumers will not be deceived and will purchase according to their actual needs to achieve universality. The price limits are recorded as follows: Coarse granulated white sugar: 4.33 yuan per catty; TK brand: 4.56 yuan per catty; No. 1 fine white: 4.32 yuan per catty; No. 4 fine white: 4.25 yuan per catty; B brand: 4.33 yuan per catty; DY brand: 4.32 yuan per catty; HX brand: 4.31 yuan per catty; Dutch red sugar: 4.06 yuan per catty; Raw sugar: 4.06 yuan per catty; Icing sugar: 4.06 yuan per catty; Surabaya blue: 3.83 yuan per catty; Winter mist blue: 3.71 yuan per catty; Zhang Diao blue: 3.71 yuan per catty; Rock sugar: 5.14 yuan per catty (calculated using a balance scale).

There are 96 stores allocated 30 bags or more, over one hundred stores allocated between 15 and 30 bags, and over two hundred stores allocated less than 15 bags. All are selling in accordance with the prescribed methods. Each store is allowed to sell one-thirtieth of the total monthly allocation each day.

### Formation of Civil Police in the Four Joint Security Districts of the French Concession

The French Concession Civil Police Corps has only been organized for more than a month, but its work is already taking shape. The trial period for the Civil Police Corps' duty posts has also expired, and its achievements are remarkable.

### Second Landlords Ingeniously Create New Items to Extort Third Tenants

Concealing from the authorities to collect fees equal to tips - Forcing tenants to move out, severely prohibiting deceptive clauses

The English-language "The Times" reports that, according to a reporter's investigation, most of the city's profit-seeking second landlords are trying to circumvent the municipal authorities' regulations abolishing tips, and are forcing third tenants to pay a sum of money in advance using new methods. This is actually equivalent to a tip, but with another ingenious name. "The Times" recently received a letter from a third tenant on Avenue Joffre, stating that the second landlords in both the Public Concession and the French Concession are demanding that third tenants pay five or six months' rent in advance. Although the collection of tips has been prohibited by the authorities, it is clear from the letter that there is some kind of secret collusion between many second landlords. They transfer the houses to each other at a very low price, while forcing the third tenants of the house to move out and find other residences. When third tenants are forced to move out, they have to pay a sum equal to six months' rent before they can move into a new home. The reason why the third tenants are forced to move out is because the lease stipulated that the third tenants must move out when the house is transferred. It is said that second landlords have been using this method to deceive the law and exploit third tenants for several months. It is not too late to find that the authorities of the Public Works Department and the French Municipal Council have previously passed regulations to prohibit the collection of small rents and reduce the difficulties of tenants. Violators have been heavily punished. For the past six weeks, several second landlords have been tried by the court every week for sound violations and fined. Therefore, second landlords have found other ways to collect rent in advance, believing that this does not violate the law. In fact, this is not the case. After prohibiting the collection of tips, the municipal authorities have not stopped their research on the rental situation, and are currently considering other methods to prevent second landlords from extorting third tenants through illegal means. One method aims to prohibit second landlords from forcibly demanding various amounts equal to tips.

### French Concession Housing Sublease License Fee

In accordance with the provisions of Order No. 333 of the French Consul General's Office in Shanghai on October 23, the French Concession Municipal Council collects housing sublease license fees. All second landlords who sublease houses must, between the 1st and 30th of this month, bring their rent receipts to the fee collection section of the council to collect three copies of the reporting form mentioned in Article 1 of this order. One copy must be filled out according to the regulations and hung by the second landlord at the internal entrance of the subleased house. After the other two copies are filled out in the same way, they must be returned to the council within the time limit and the half-year license fee must be paid. Within the date specified in the reporting form, the council will issue a housing sublease license. The general office of the council's fee collection section is at No. 80, Marlang Road. The daily office hours are from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM and 2:00 PM to 5:00 PM, except on Saturday afternoons, Sundays, and public holidays. There are two branch offices of the fee collection section: one at No. 1480, Lafayette Road in the Western District, and one at No. 7, Avenue Edward VII in the Eastern District. The daily office hours are from 2:00 PM to 5:00 PM, except on Saturdays and Sundays. The license fee rates are as follows: (A) If the rent paid by the second landlord does not exceed 100 yuan, the license fee is 1 yuan per room subleased per month. (B) If the rent paid by the second landlord is between 100 yuan and 200 yuan, the license fee is 2 yuan per room subleased per month. (C) If the rent paid by the second landlord exceeds 200 yuan, the license fee is 3 yuan per room subleased per month. Any second landlord who delays reporting shall be punished in accordance with the provisions of Article 20 of the Housing Sublease Regulations.

Gleanings on Opium Prohibition in the Qing Dynasty

Opium poisoning has plagued China, causing great harm to the nation. In the middle of the Guangxu reign, an edict to prohibit opium was issued, and strict measures were allowed for officials. At that time, Wang Zhongqi, the prefect of Jingzhou, was also a leisure-loving person. Unwilling to be subjected to the humiliation of investigation, he closed his door and cut off opium, forcing himself to quit. After three days of suffering, he actually jumped out of the sea of misery. Unfortunately, he was over fifty years old and his qi and blood had declined. Due to the effects of opium poisoning, he died of dysentery. The Qing court praised his determination and gave him generous compensation and extreme mourning. Those who quit opium must first eliminate the accumulated poison. If the poison is not cleared, even if the addiction is broken, they will not be able to sleep peacefully. Now there is "Chlorophyll," a new drug for quitting opium. It extracts the natural ingredient that overcomes the poison from the green, evergreen leaves. Taking it excretes the opium poison in the stool and urine, which is extremely thorough. Many people have quit opium and white powder, and they do not feel pain or affect their work. It is sold by the Wanguo Western Drug Company in the Tianlun Building of the Baobuzhang on Nanjing Road, for 20 yuan per box. Telephone 94078.

### A Detailed Account of the Murder in the New "Records of Retribution": Abandoning His Wife and Taking a Concubine Caused the Trouble - A Fickle Woman Stirred Up a Sea of Jealousy and Killed Her Husband - Jiang Boming Blackmailed His Sister Unsuccessfully and Reported Her Out of Hatred

Li Liansheng, a former detective in the French Concession, nicknamed "Pockmarked Li Liansheng," from Nanjing, accumulated hundreds of thousands of yuan when he retired. He lived in No. 13, Lane 987, Avenue Joffre, living the life of a retired merchant in Shanghai, planning to enjoy his old age. On the morning of April 22, 1929, he was hacked to death at home. He was only 48 years old. The case has been under investigation for three and a half years. Recently, the French Concession police solved the case and found that Li's murder was instigated by his wife, Ms. Jiang. The main suspect, Li Jiang (i.e., Jiang Wenzhen), and the related persons, Qian Guanhua (Ms. Jiang's lover), Jiang Boming (Ms. Jiang's younger brother), Zhang Hankai, and Zhang Afu were arrested and brought to justice for investigation. However, the murderer is on the run and is being pursued. The details have been recorded in the newspaper. Now, a supplement is made to record the

Cause and Effect of the Murder. Li had a legal wife, but because Li was inherently promiscuous, he was not surprised to engage in affairs. Since meeting Ms. Jiang, he hated his legal wife and used卑鄙激烈的手段 means to force his legal wife to leave, treating Ms. Jiang as his main wife, and supporting her elderly father and weak younger brother. Who knew that good times would not last long? Li concealed from Ms. Jiang that he had met a young woman outside, and secretly built a golden house to hide her. He often treated Ms. Jiang and her father and brother coldly. Eventually, Ms. Jiang learned that Li had secretly taken a concubine outside.

A Sea of Jealousy Arose. She quarreled with Li, trying to make him break off with the concubine. Who knew that arguing was useless? On the contrary, it made her elderly father die of depression. Looking at the future, fearing that Li would use the same tricks to abandon his wife and abandon her, Ms. Jiang was terrified and gave birth to the evil thought of harming Li and seizing his property. After discussing with her lover Qian Guanhua and her younger brother Jiang Boming, Qian and Jiang asked Zhang Hankai to ask Zhang Afu, a small foreman at the Shanghai Textile Factory, to find four murderers, including Jiang 蔣某. They first held a meeting at Jing'an Villa to

Plan the Murder. Ms. Jiang usually slept until nearly noon. On the morning of Li's murder, she got up early to arrange everything, opening the back door and the bedroom door, waiting for the murderers to directly enter the bedroom and hack Li to death. Ms. Jiang remained silent, calmly hiding Li's property, and then announced the matter to the police. Ms. Jiang's behavior was瞒被警務人員之耳目 concealed from the eyes and ears of the police. After the funeral, because Li still had an elderly mother and a weak child, Ms. Jiang

Analyzed the Inheritance. After allocating a small portion, she used the funds to reward the people involved in killing Li and the murderers. She also invested in opening a Maoda Foreign Firm呢羬西服店 woolen Western clothing store at No. 808, Avenue Joffre, with her lover Qian Guanhua as the manager, and appointed her younger brother Jiang Boming as the accountant. Ms. Jiang, from this point on, regarded herself as the boss and

Human Life Blood Case, she was spared the law of law. The human ghost did not know and lived freely. Jiang Boming relied on his sister's assets and acted like a small boss, entering and leaving dance halls on weekdays, squandering money like dirt. Because 僓台高　, he was unable to make up for the debts with the four sides. He forced his sister Ms. Jiang to pay him 60,000 gold coins in order to repay his debts. However, Ms. Jiang refused to agree, causing Boming to hold a grudge and

The Murder of Her Husband. He reported the fact that his sister had hired someone to kill her husband to the detectives, wanting to force his sister to pay him money by this. However, he played a trick and ruined it. The old case of Li's murder for three and a half years was able to be revealed, and the case was solved. Li Jiang, Qian Guanhua, Jiang Boming, Zhang Hankai, Zhang Afu, and others were all arrested and brought to justice by the police. However, the real murderers, Jiang 蔣某 and the other three, were at large and were being pursued by the police.

### Friendly Team Wins Against Mixed Team 2-1 in the Last Minute - Evenly Matched, Each Scoring One Goal in the First Half - Self-Defense Cup Charity Football Tournament Concludes Successfully

The Self-Defense Cup football tournament, organized by the Public Concession Baojia Guidance Committee, was held yesterday afternoon at Jiaozhou Park. The Friendly team scored in the last minute because Mixed team players Lei Medy and Victor collided, allowing Li Yichen to seize the opportunity to rush in and Sun Jinshun to score the winning goal. The final score was 2-1, with the first half ending 1-1. Throughout the match, the situation was tense and thrilling. Both teams were well-matched, evenly balanced, with both gains and losses, deadlocked until luck determined the victory. The audience exceeded ten thousand, and the lively atmosphere surpassed even the Baojia Cup.

Each Has Its Own Strengths

Both teams excelled in defense. Song Lingsheng deserves the most credit for the Friendly team's unbeaten record. As the third defender, he played very effectively, saving countless balls. Gain was constantly under his watch. Second to him were Li Tiansheng and Liu Xianhan, against whom the Mixed team's long attacks were ineffective. Li Yichen and Sun Jinshun maintained their usual style, taking advantage of opportunities, while others performed just averagely. For the Mixed team, the goalkeeper's excellent performance was unexpected. His high jumps to save balls were highly praised. The center of Xitian, the mustachioed Greenberg, and the two defenders all displayed strong defense, leaving the Friendly team's forwards at a loss. It's a pity that the center forward Gain lacked support from both wings, often unable to get the ball into the goal. Overall, it was a good match, with a high level of play.

How the Fierce Battle Unfolded

Mr. Yuan Li kicked off. During halftime, according to custom, the ball was auctioned off and purchased by Mr. Pan Sansheng for a high price of 12,000 yuan. After the kickoff, the Friendly team launched an all-out attack. Victor cleared the ball, and the two teams battled fiercely, forming a seesaw battle. The Friendly team's defense was under heavy pressure, but Song Lingsheng defused the danger. Both sides were very cautious. At 31 minutes, luck favored the Friendly team. Zhuo Shijin made a clever pass to Wu Qixiang. Little Wu lived up to expectations, diving in with all his might. Mixed team goalkeeper McNedy went too far to the side, and the ball entered the net. Little Wu injured his foot due to excessive force and had to leave the field. The Friendly team took the lead with a score of 1-0. However, the lead was short-lived. Zheng Yingquan committed a foul in the penalty area, resulting in a penalty kick, which was scored by V. Su Ruo. The first half ended 1-1. Switching sides, the Friendly team brought on Jiang Chao Meng Yiliang, and the situation became even more tense. The melee lasted for a full ten minutes. Zhuo Shijin and Gao Baozheng repeatedly tried to steal behind enemy lines, but made no progress. The Mixed team attacked fiercely, and the situation was very dangerous. Unexpectedly, the ball was leaked to the back. Lei Medy and Victor rushed back to grab the ball and collided, falling to the ground. Li Yichen seized the opportunity to enter and lightly passed to Sun Jinshun, who shot and scored. The deadlock was broken, and the Friendly team was fortunate to win in the last minute. After the game, Wang Boyuan, Vice Chairman of the Baojia Committee, presented the awards and closed the event.

Weekly Market Commentary

### Research on the Trend of Cultural Stocks - Part Two of the Discussion on the Trend of Chinese Stocks

The trend of cultural stocks soared last week, becoming unstoppable. According to the weekly industry index of major Chinese stocks compiled by the China Economic Research Institute, with June of this year as 100%, the total index of 16 Chinese stocks last week was 147.5%. However, the World Book Company reached 236.5%, and the China Book Company also reached 162.9%. Although the Commercial Press was only at 138.8%, it still rose by 6% compared to the previous week. The prices of other stocks generally fell back by 1-2%.

There are no less than fifteen or sixteen types of cultural industry stocks circulating this year (including paper mills, film companies, etc.). The main ones are four publishing companies such as the Commercial Press, three printing companies such as Yilin and Yongxiang, and six paper-making companies such as Longzhang. In particular, the three publishing companies of the Commercial Press, China Book Company, and World Book Company have always been the three major authorities in the national publishing industry, with large scales and long histories, making profound and significant contributions to culture in the past.

Since the war, due to difficulties in distribution, the business of these three companies has greatly contracted. In addition, some of their factories are under military management, or dispersed due to relocation, such as the Commercial Press, which has frequent labor disputes, so stock prices are often below par. Since last year, the situation has slightly changed. Firstly, book prices have become expensive due to cost and hoarding, secondly, they have been stimulated by the general rise in stock prices, and thirdly, they have been affected by the increase in the value of factory assets themselves, as well as the stimulus of World Book Company's capital increase. Therefore, they have successively jumped above par and doubled repeatedly, seemingly entering a prosperous era with other industries. It must be said that the performance of cultural stocks at this time and place is a most interesting event.

During the currency fluctuations in early June of this year, the stock prices of these three companies all suffered setbacks at one time. However, they immediately erased this impact. But by early July, the market atmosphere had reached a state of saturation, followed by continuous weakness. It was not until early September that improvements were seen. Since then, the rising momentum has become tighter day by day, especially for World Book Company and China Book Company. The reason is that China Book Company was affected by the capital increase, and World Book Company had news of the return of its factory. This is the origin of the strong market sentiment.

According to the weekly Chinese stock index compiled by the China Economic Research Institute, the changes in the stock prices of these three companies, compared with the general trend, have shown a rapid leap in recent months, which is indeed the most noteworthy thing.

Judging from this, World Book Company has increased the most, and the magic of the return announcement is truly amazing. Most of the company's authorities are in Shanghai, the internal organization is sound, and the spirit is full. Since November last year, it has increased its capital twice in succession, with a current capital of 5 million yuan. The face value was initially 25 yuan, then changed to 50 yuan, and now changed to 25 yuan again. In the autumn of last year, it reissued five points of dividends for the years 27, 28, and 29, and one point five mills of dividends and bonuses for the year 30.

The rise is second only to World Book Company for China Book Company, which is affected by the capital increase. The rumor of the capital increase had been circulating for a long time, but it was only confirmed last week. After the company increased its capital at the end of the 25th year, Kong Xiangxi and Xu Keting served as chairman and supervisor respectively, but now the details are unknown. It is only known that three of the current directors have passed away without being supplemented, so there are many who are surprised by this capital increase. The company currently has a capital of 4 million yuan, with a face value of 50 yuan per share, and the dividends for last year have not been paid.

The Commercial Press has always been the leader in the national publishing industry, and the situation in recent years has been quite difficult. The impact of the war may be the heaviest among the three companies. However, the company has always attached great importance to the interests of shareholders, and the company's reputation has also played a role in attracting investors. Therefore, the company's stock is still not ignored in the autumn of World Book Company's and China Book Company's soaring prices.

### Market Trends

Bond Market Crashes - The bond market, affected by the tight money supply and the crackdown on bond market news, is in a state of panic and uncertainty. Major players are exiting, retail investors are shorting, and bond prices across the board are plummeting, wiping out weeks of gains. Prices plunged by four yuan on Saturday, forcing trading to be halted.

The violent rise and fall confirms that the market is a speculative organization. Speculation is on the list of bans, and the crackdown is not groundless. It was first reported by the Dongbao newspaper, and then reprinted by other newspapers, causing widespread panic and a huge wave.

As for future trends, it depends on whether the outsiders in the market will reveal or conceal the cards in their hands.

Cultural Stocks Soar

Last week's Chinese stock market saw mixed gains and losses. Generally speaking, cultural stocks are booming and rising sharply, and new pharmaceutical stocks still have some upward momentum. At the weekend, the news of New Asia Pharmaceutical Factory's capital increase plan was leaked, and the market sentiment tightened accordingly. However, the trends of stocks in other industries have shown signs of weakening.

According to the weekly industry index of major Chinese stocks compiled by the China Economic Research Institute, the following table shows (the full-year average for June of this year is 100 points):

(1) The September index in the table above uses the average price for the entire month of June of this year as 100%, so the price index of each stock in September is as above. At that time, the only ones below the June level were Guohuo, Zhongfa Pharmacy, Commercial Press, and China Book Company; the rest all rose from 1.5% to 132.6%.

(2) (3) are the comparisons between the previous week and last week with June. Comparing the previous week with June, all stock prices rose from 0.2% to 182.1%, with an average increase of 44.5%. Comparing last week with June, underwear has fallen by 1.2%, and in addition, there were more rises than falls, so the average total increase was 47.5%.

When comparing (2) and (3) with each other, the trend of rise and fall of each stock is also very obvious. The only ones that rose were World Book Company, China Book Company, Commercial Press, Dasheng No. 1 Factory, and Great China Match Factory, while the rest all retreated compared to the previous week. However, even though there were more falls than rises, the overall index still rose compared to the previous week, which shows how large the increase was for these few stocks.

The recent rise of new pharmaceutical stocks has been detailed in the article "Research on the Trend of New Pharmaceutical Stocks" in the previous issue of this journal. This issue also contains the article "Research on the Trend of Cultural Stocks", and the rapid progress of the market prices of World Book Company, China Book Company, Commercial Press, etc. last week can also be seen in general.

Public Industries Association News

The Public Industries Association was originally an open market for foreign stocks. It has been closed since December 8th and there have been repeated rumors of reopening, but amidst the calls to ban speculation, is the restoration of the association necessary? The relevant authorities in this city are constantly studying the matter. Yesterday, Japanese newspapers carried talks by the authorities of the Japanese Asia Development Board on this issue, generally saying that the resumption of business of the Public Industries Association has been approved in principle. The association is currently under military management, and in the future, the military will entrust the Asia Development Board's Central China Liaison Department to implement the resumption of business under the department's full supervision and guidance. As for the items traded, only the stocks, public bonds, etc. approved by the merchant are allowed. The issues such as the implementation period and the scope of brokerage firms are currently being studied by relevant parties.

Yarn and Cloth

Although the relevant authorities have successively implemented a retail price limit system for wool, cloth, etc., and further investigated and banned substandard measuring tools last week to prevent abuses, the wholesale market price of yarn has begun to rise again since mid-October, and the surge became more intense in late October. As for last week, the situation was even more dangerous, with each batch rising by hundreds of yuan every day. There was news in the newspaper about investigating yarn speculators, but even though the case was settled, the market sentiment did not move at all, with no sense of mutual dependence or shared fate, and its frenzy was like this.

This price surge is said to be related to the purchase price of raw cotton. The purchase of cotton production in Central China is divided into two regions, Jiangbei and Jiangnan. The purchase price in Jiangbei has already been announced, but Jiangnan has not yet been formally decided. Speculators are making wild guesses, and the yarn market is becoming tighter. Comparing the end of the week with the beginning of the week, Feng has risen from 5,600 to 5,820 yuan, and Ma has risen from 6,300 to 6,470 yuan. If we consider the market price on October 1, Feng was only 5,050 yuan, and Ma was only 5,450 yuan; after a month, Feng has risen by about 1,000 yuan. The winter is coming, how will people protect themselves? The relevant authorities will definitely not ignore this serious situation.

### Off-Market Chat

The East Asia Economic Conference held in Tokyo held a financial investigation committee on the 23rd of last month to review the currency policy in Central China.

A large number of Japanese-made ceramics will be shipped to Shanghai recently, and Japanese merchant Iino Itsuto and others have organized the Ceramic Export Promotion Co., Ltd. to handle this export business to China.

Knitted cotton products have been reviewed by the relevant price review committee and a fixed price system will be implemented soon.

According to the Japanese newspaper China Intelligence Agency yesterday, the market prices of 20 strands of Blue Phoenix yarn in the following places on October 28 were as follows (unit: military ticket yuan):

Suzhou 1179 yuan Nanjing 1242 yuan

Bingxi 1188 yuan Wuhu 1698 yuan

Changzhou 1143 yuan Hangzhou 1315 yuan

Zhenjiang 1440 yuan Tongzhou 1216 yuan

Yangzhou 1381 yuan Taixian 1216 yuan

According to a short commentary in the same newspaper on the same day, after the price freeze order was implemented in this city on September 1, the goods originally planned to be shipped from Central China to North China were temporarily suspended from export, including 12 million yuan of yarn and cloth. If combined with the goods temporarily suspended from being shipped to Mengjiang, the total is about 20 million yuan. Therefore, it is believed that the current price control and barter system need to be re-adjusted.

The second exchange plan between Central China and Manchuria has now been signed by the relevant authorities of both parties. In addition to continuing to exchange Central China's cotton products and miscellaneous goods for Manchuria's soybeans, soybean oil, and other originally scheduled items, the exchange of Manchuria's charcoal and asphalt has now been increased by about 5 million yuan.

The Japanese-owned Central China Silk Company will start purchasing autumn cocoons in the northeast region of Zhejiang on the 22nd of this month. According to the company's planned purchase for this year, the spring cocoons will be 80,000 dan and the autumn cocoons will be 7,000 dan.

### Be Careful of Imitations

— Wu Tao

Recently, it was reported that a woman dressed in elegant clothes repeatedly went to silver shops pretending to look at jewelry, swapping fake items for real ones. She was finally caught by a discerning clerk while repeating her trick. It is said that this noble lady does not come from a poor family, but she resorted to such measures because she was addicted to gambling and had incurred excessive debts, which she had to make up for. As a result, her reputation was ruined, and she had no face to meet anyone.

Performing the trick of passing off imitations for real ones is certainly not an easy task, requiring considerable skill to use lightning-fast maneuvers when people are not paying attention. However, those who are victimized cannot help but feel grief and hatred. So, although the means of passing off imitations for real ones is clever, it is harmful and useless to society and others, and it will ultimately not bring much benefit to the individual, so it is not worth trying.

Unfortunately, however, in all levels of society, there are more or less those who flaunt their imitations. Some are even intellectuals and ladies of high society. They use their graceful and luxurious appearance to carry out fraudulent schemes, taking advantage of their low abilities and minimal labor to obtain generous rewards. These deadbeats are also those who pass off imitations for real ones in society. They are often harmful and useless animals, and we should be careful to guard against them.

### New Glass

— Shi Dong

Transparent glass is one of humanity's boons, its only drawback being its fragility. Therefore, scientists have worked hard to discover a new type of shatterproof glass, and they have now achieved exceptionally satisfactory results in this area.

The safety glass used for car windshields is well known. This was accidentally discovered in 1903. A French chemist dropped a glass bottle on the ground, and surprisingly, it only cracked without shattering. The cracked pieces were held together by a thin film of celluloid left inside the bottle by the evaporated solution.

When this film is sandwiched between two layers of glass, safety glass is produced. This invention has saved countless people from injury or even death.

The newly invented safety glass is made of a moldable resin. To not only prevent the glass from shattering or cracking but also to make it bulletproof, they use three to five layers of glass sandwiched with resin.

Another type of safety glass is a glass lined with very fine metal wires. This is often used in the display windows of pearl shops. It can not only prevent explosions but also defend against thieves who smash glass to rob.

Another type is a glass that is only one-eighth of an inch thick, sandwiched with multiple layers of vinyl resin. It is guaranteed to be absolutely shatterproof. A professional baseball pitcher could throw a hardball at it from a distance of thirty-five feet, but he could not break it. Under heat and pressure, this moldable film becomes a permanent bond between the layers of glass. This new type of glass has been widely used in American cars.

In addition, there is also a special type of glass. This does not use the "sandwich" principle but rather the so-called reinforcement method. It can prevent explosions and has great resistance to heat and cold.

In addition to being able to flex freely, it is exceptionally strong. When supported at both ends, four adults can stand on a sheet of glass.

The so-called reinforcement method is to heat the glass to the melting point and then suddenly cool both sides with a blast of cold air. Under the pressure exerted on the surface, the interior cools more slowly, resulting in an incredibly strong glass.

### Flowers of Smiles

— Huang Wenjin

Someone once cried out in despair: "Suffering, suffering, only suffering is the essence of the organic human body, only suffering is all of human life."

Yes, this world is a flawed world, and the absence of suffering is only accidental. However, although reality is painful, the pain of reality is the source of happiness.

In the ebb and flow of good and evil, our suffering is entirely born of "contradictions." On the one hand, conscience urges us to pursue truth and to realize justice; on the other hand, we cannot resist the threat to survival and are conquered by the material environment. In this completely disharmonious contradiction, no one can avoid drinking the bloody wine of suffering for long. The lofty tower of ideals can be allowed to be wantonly destroyed by the wind, but as long as we are alive, we cannot but advance our steps and move toward the truth.

Water the buds of life with blood and tears, cultivate the sweet fruits of happiness with laughter; to explore the bright future, temporary endurance should be our responsibility. In the desert, we must seek water and grass like camels; in despair, we must cut through the thorns like warriors. Then, the flowers of future smiles have already bloomed for us, let us look forward to them in suffering and in hope.

### The Mediators of Goods

— Gang Zhi

(2) Business is Difficult

Street running is easier for large manufacturers because the goods in stores must rely on the supply from the factory. The factory's street runner is therefore flattered. Although named "street runner," they may not have to go out every day to solicit business. If there is a transaction, customers will come to them. Sometimes, the factory's price is more expensive than the spot price on the market, but the street runner only needs to say a few words, and the customer will "give face" and accept it. This kind of street runner can be said to be a swindler among street runners. As for ordinary street runners, unless they have special "skills," they will have a hard time. When soliciting goods from customers, the purchasing manager rarely pays attention to you, and may even drive you away. If they intend to buy goods from you, and the price has been agreed upon, they are still afraid that it will be inferior goods or a scam, and they will ask you to deliver the goods first and then pay. The rules of the business world are mostly cash before delivery, so the business is not completed, and a pair of legs are wasted.

Brokerage business is especially difficult, but after the war, due to the influx of floating capital, owners frantically hoarded goods, and brokers became very active. These people who have money to hoard goods are all outsiders, regardless of whether they are "dead goods" or "live goods." Business is easy, and making money is fast, so there are many young people who have just completed their apprenticeships, or even students who have just graduated from school, who only know the name of the goods and have never seen them. They actually take on the role of brokers, handling transactions and taking commissions. The places where they gather to discuss business are mostly in tea rooms, teahouses, and other public places, but they are not direct intermediary sales. I entrust it to you, and you entrust it to him, and he transfers it to another person... After several transfers, a transaction is often handled by more than a dozen people. The most interesting thing is that after being entrusted here and there, a sample of goods may even be passed back to the original seller, which shows the complexity of the inside story. Every time the goods are transferred by them, the price also increases once, because they all want to add a commission. In the end, something that was originally priced at five or six hundred yuan is increased to seven or eight hundred yuan after they add it again and again. This kind of business is extremely difficult to do, and there are many who eat "empty soup dumplings" (earn nothing).

### About Conversation

— Ouli

In ordinary conversation, 850 words are enough.

According to physiologists, the movements and use of muscles are most subtle when we talk.

An average person speaks 90 words per minute; a fast speaker often speaks 150 words per minute.

Someone went to the streets, sports fields, churches, theaters, and barbershops to analyze 500 conversations and found that the main topic of men's conversations was business, and the topic women talked about the most was men. The secondary topic of men's conversations was sports and entertainment; the secondary topic of women's conversations was clothing. The third theme of men's conversations was the affairs of other men; the third theme of women's conversations was the affairs of other women. - Translated from "Everyman's Life Magazine"

### Sharing the Same Boat in Storms

— He Jia Zhi

10. Flying Peak

Mrs. Ye the Second could not resolve their difficulties and could only respond with a smile, "Wait until after your sister-in-law's first anniversary and the New Year. Then think about it carefully again. Don't talk about Miss Chen now. I say, the Ye family's daughter-in-law will either be Miss Chen or Miss Bian. Anyway, you'll choose one of the two." Wei Cheng also laughed and said, "Auntie is right." Mrs. Ye the Second said, "Wei Cheng, come outside." Wei Cheng followed Mrs. Ye the Second outside. Mrs. Ye the Second discussed with him whether or not to hold a Water and Land Ritual for the first anniversary of Mrs. Ye the First. If they were to do it on a large scale, they would have to borrow money. If they were just to have a family memorial ceremony and invite a few relatives for a meal, then there would be no need to borrow any money. Wei Cheng's idea was to be thrifty. The clanging of gongs and cymbals during the Water and Land Ritual would make people feel dizzy and would not benefit the deceased, nor would it count as fulfilling filial piety for the living. For the anniversary memorial, sincerity is the most important thing; formal fanfare is not necessary. Wei Cheng also anticipated that the anniversary of his mother's death was on the 28th day of the twelfth lunar month. On this day, relatives and friends would have their own affairs and might not be able to spare the time to come. After he said this, Mrs. Ye the Second decided not to take any further action.

Another day, Cui Zhen was also counting down the days until the first anniversary of Mrs. Ye the First. She secretly instructed A Xing to go to Huagang to ask when Hongqi Zhang's boat would go to Shanghai. A Xing returned and said that it would set sail tonight. Cui Zhen suddenly packed a bundle in the room. Magpie saw it and asked, "Miss Cui Zhen, where are you going?" Cui Zhen said, "I want to go to Shanghai and will be back in a day or two." Magpie felt that this was new and strange news and hurriedly told Mrs. Ye the Second. Mrs. Ye the First still didn't believe Magpie's words. Although she didn't believe it, she couldn't help but ask Cui Zhen. Cui Zhen was pressing a pair of cotton shoes into the bundle when she turned around and saw Mrs. Ye the Second. She quickly smiled and said, "Second Auntie, I want to go to Shanghai to invite Miss Chen. I'll be back in a day. If Miss Chen still has the same temperament as before, she will definitely come when she hears about First Auntie's first anniversary. Miss Chen's school has let out for the holidays these past few days." Mrs. Ye the Second laughed at her for not discussing it with anyone beforehand. She also pitied her determination to secure the position of the Ye family's daughter-in-law. Guo Fang then waved her hand and said, "That's not necessary." (218)
