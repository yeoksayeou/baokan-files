Our ships fired cannons and torpedoes simultaneously. The American flagship Astoria was the first to be hit and sunk in flames. A few minutes later, an Australian Class A cruiser also caught fire and slowly sank. That night, we sank seven enemy Class A cruisers, one Class B cruiser, and six destroyers, and heavily damaged two enemy destroyers. Our ships suffered no losses. Furthermore, according to torpedo plane pilots who participated in the battle, on the morning of the 9th, our planes launched again to sweep up the remaining enemies, patrolling the area near where the sea battle occurred. No enemies were sighted. Soon after, an enemy ship was seen heading towards Sydney. One of them, either the Achilles or a cruiser, was hit by a torpedo and sank.

### Sapru Asks British Government to Send Delegation to India; Resume Negotiations to Resolve Indian Question; Congress Party Asks Muslim League to Cooperate

Bombay, 15th (Havas News Agency) – Sir Tej Bahadur Sapru, leader of the Indian Liberal Party, issued a statement today calling on the British government to immediately send a delegation to India to reopen negotiations and resolve the Indian question. The statement said, "In recent days, various incidents have occurred throughout India, drastically changing the situation. After careful consideration, I believe the only feasible way to resolve the issue is for the British government to quickly send a plenipotentiary representative to consult with Indian leaders on all matters. This constructive negotiation should be conducted with courage and vision."

Saigon, 17th (Haitong News Agency) – According to news from New Delhi, Sapru, President of the Indian Liberal League, suggested mediating the conflict between the British government and the Congress Party. Sapru stated that he requested the British government to send a new delegation to India to reopen negotiations with Indian leaders. The Indian question should be resolved through political means.

London, 16th (Havas News Agency) – According to Reuters news today, several members of Parliament, especially Labour MPs, are now requesting that both Houses convene immediately to allow the government authorities to report on the Indian situation and discuss this issue as soon as possible. Parliament is currently in summer recess, which normally lasts ten weeks. Although it has been shortened, the general public is expressing dissatisfaction that cabinet members and members of Parliament still need to take vacations during wartime, while the holidays for workers in military factories have been reduced to two weeks a year.

Tokyo, 17th (Domei News Agency) – According to news obtained from Rome by the Nichi-Nichi Shimbun today, the Indian Chambers of Commerce in Bombay and New Delhi resolved yesterday to support the Indian independence movement and refuse to cooperate with British wartime industrial expansion in India.

Advocating the Formation of a Provisional Government

Bombay, 16th (Havas News Agency) – The Executive Committee of the Indian Muslim League met here today, chaired by Jinnah, for two and a half hours, before deciding to continue the meeting tomorrow. Before the Executive Committee meeting, Jinnah received a telegram from Rajagopalachari, a key figure in the Indian Congress Party and the former Chief Minister of Madras Province, urging the Muslim League to cooperate with the Congress Party to break the current deadlock. The telegram stated, "At this moment, an urgent demand has arisen even among Muslims, believing that the only way to achieve a quick and decisive resolution is to form a provisional government that can speak for the country and demand that Britain relinquish all sovereignty in India. This move can shatter the imperialistic attempts of the British Empire to indefinitely remain in India. We assure the Muslim League that the right to self-determination of all political or religious entities within India will be respected by the Congress Party. The land belonging to each of these entities can, if possible, be designated as autonomous regions. In the future, the only connection between these regions and other parts of India will be the common mission arising from resisting aggression and defending the country. There should be no problem for the Muslim League to cooperate with the Congress Party on the above basis. In this way, a provisional government bearing full responsibility for national defense and administration can be established. We must act decisively at this critical moment to prevent disputes. The Muslim League should nominate representatives to participate in the future provisional government and notify the Congress Party of the number of participants. The Muslim League should also demand that the British government accept its proposed 'Muslim and Congress Party Joint Program.' If Britain or the Congress Party refuses, they will be responsible for the failure of this plan and all its consequences."

Bangkok, 17th (Haitong News Agency) – Madras dispatch: Rajagopalachari, former leader of the Madras government, wrote to Jinnah, Chairman of the Muslim Association, the night before the Executive Committee meeting, urging Muslims to negotiate with the British government and the Congress Party, advocating the formation of an Indian government representing all the people of India, and urging the British to hand over power to that government. The Muslim Association will cooperate with the Congress Party based on the "Partition Plan" to jointly resist foreign enemies.

Calcutta Post Office Burned Down

Bombay, 16th (Havas News Agency) – Unrest continues in major Indian cities. The Calcutta Post Office has been burned down. Several bus lines have resumed operations, but trams are still suspended. New Delhi is relatively calm, and trains have resumed operation. An explosive incident occurred in the Aminabad district of Lucknow, seriously injuring one police officer and slightly injuring several policemen. Afterwards, the authorities conducted a thorough search in the area near the explosion.

Gothenburg, 15th (Domei News Agency) – A week has passed since the Indian government arrested National Congress leaders Gandhi, Nehru, and Acharya on the morning of the 19th and began suppression. By the 10th, the Indian government had arrested approximately 200 key figures of the National Congress and their affiliates. The anti-British struggle of the Indian people, angered by the measures taken by the British authorities, is intensifying daily. According to a New Delhi dispatch on the 15th, the masses set fire to four railway stations between Madras and Calcutta. The railway line is now guarded by the military. Clashes between the masses and the police have occurred repeatedly, resulting in approximately 5,000 deaths and injuries. Most factories have been shut down due to worker strikes. Indian cabinet members of the Governor-General's Executive Council are urging the British authorities to allow more Indians to participate in the council and grant them positions such as Finance Minister in order to stop the anti-British demonstrations and restore the Indian Congress to normal. There are also rumors of a British monarch guaranteeing unconditional and complete independence after the war. However, in the current situation, it is impossible to win over the hearts of the Indian people with empty promises.

### Argentina and Spain Negotiate Trade Agreement; Focusing on Establishing Free Ports in Spain

Buenos Aires, 16th (Havas News Agency) – Regarding the trade agreement negotiations between Spain and Argentina, the agreement can be signed once the governments of both parties approve the draft prepared by the experts. One of the clauses proposes the establishment of several free ports in Spain, allowing Argentine products to be transported to other countries through these ports. The trade agreement will be signed by Spanish representative Konos and Argentine Foreign Minister Ginasso, who are expected to make important statements reiterating the close ties between the two countries.

Argentina's Economic Relations with Europe

Berlin, 17th (Haitong News Agency) – The economic negotiations currently underway between Argentina and Spain in Buenos Aires are about to conclude with an agreement. The significance of this event is profound and incomparable, especially during this wartime period. It further demonstrates that South American countries are economically dependent on Europe, a fact that cannot be concealed by the rhetoric of the White House and Wall Street. It is important to understand that the natural phenomenon of economic mutual assistance does not exist between the United States and South America, but between Europe and South America. For example, in the years before the war, three-quarters of Argentina's export trade was to Europe, with half of it going to continental countries. The arguments and figures in the speech delivered by the Argentine Minister of Agriculture at the end of 1940 all demonstrate that Europe has always been the economic lifeline of Argentina. Trade between Argentina and Germany was extremely prosperous in the years before the war, which was greatly related to the economic recovery of Germany after the National Socialist Party came to power. As was the case after the last World War, Argentine President Irygoyen strongly resisted public opinion and maintained national neutrality, avoiding being drawn into the war. The benefits gained by the Argentine people are self-evident. The policies currently pursued by Argentina are also very wise, consistently adopting a realistic attitude towards the signatories of the Tripartite Pact.

### Japanese Ambassadors to France and Germany Hold Talks in Berlin

### Stalingrad Becomes the Focus of the Eastern Front; Soviet Army Announces Abandonment of Meiguupu and Destruction of Oil Wells Before Retreating

Stockholm, 17th (Havas News Agency) – The focus of the Eastern Front has now shifted to the Stalingrad area and the upper reaches of the Komponga River. The fighting around Meiguupu has become secondary. The German side claims to control the entire Don River, which the Soviet Union denies. Moscow authorities expressed optimism yesterday about the battle for Stalingrad, and said that the German offensive from the southwest had failed. However, neutral observers said that the German army could attack Stalingrad from both the north and south at any time.

Hitler's Headquarters, 17th (Haitong News Agency) – The German military report this afternoon stated: "Our army continues to advance in the south of the lower reaches of the Kupen River and in the northwestern region of the Caucasus Mountains. Three enemy ships were sunk by our aircraft near the Black Sea coast, and one large transport ship was heavily damaged. The enemy was defeated in the northeastern part of the Don River bend, and the remaining enemy in this area is still being cleared. The entire Don River basin is under the control of the German and allied forces. Our fighter-bombers and dive-bombers also attacked enemy railway facilities. The enemy launched multiple attacks on Vyazma east and Rzhev yesterday, all of which were repelled. Several enemy troops were counterattacked by our army, suffering heavy losses. Several locations in the north were attacked by the enemy, but were repelled by intense artillery fire."

Istanbul, 17th (Haitong News Agency) – According to Soviet war reports, the Soviet army has withdrawn from Meiguupu, but destroyed the oil wells before retreating.

Lisbon, 17th (Domei News Agency) – According to observers, after the fall of Meiguupu Krasnodar, the oil fields in that area will be completely occupied by the German army. Part of the German army is pursuing the Red Army, while the other part is engaged in controlling the oil pipeline from Meiguupu to Duupus. The Meiguupu oil field is the most recently developed. In 1913, its output did not exceed 88,000 tons, but it gradually increased to 1,500,000 tons in 1937 and 2,200,000 tons in the following year.

Stockholm, 16th (Havas News Agency) – According to a TASS report, the German army on all fronts is currently fighting hard to advance, and the German General Staff has issued an order to transfer reserve units to reinforce the front lines. As of yesterday, the battle situation on each front was as follows:
- In the Kraskaya area, the German army repeatedly attempted to break into the Red Army's line of defense, but was repelled.
- The German army's attack on Stalingrad and the Volga River was unsuccessful and suffered heavy losses.
- The German army's attack northeast of Kotelnikovo was defeated after fierce resistance from the Red Army. However, after obtaining reinforcements, the German army launched another attack towards the railway line from Kotelnikovo to Stalingrad. The Red Army is now fighting hard to resist, and is conducting counterattacks in some areas. The fighting around the train station is particularly intense.

### German Summer Offensive Continues; Reserve Troops Called Up to Reinforce Front Lines

Stockholm, 17th (Domei News Agency) – According to a Berlin report, the first phase of the German summer offensive on the Eastern Front, which began after breaking through the Soviet defense line between Kursk and Kharkov and penetrating deep into central Caucasus, has come to an end. The second phase is underway, with the objectives being Stalingrad, the Caspian Sea port of Astrakhan, and the Black Sea ports.

Berlin, 17th (Haitong News Agency) – The German summer offensive is still underway. The German army, launched an offensive from Kursk, has now advanced to the northern Caucasus, penetrating 1,000 kilometers into the Soviet Union. The battlefield from Kharkov to the Don River bend has shifted eastward by more than 500 kilometers. The German army in the lower reaches of the Kupen River continues to clear the remaining Soviet troops. The German, Romanian, and Slovak armies are pursuing the retreating Soviet troops and advancing towards the Black Sea ports of Novorossiysk, Anapa, and Tuapse. German aircraft are bombing the ports to prevent Soviet troops from evacuating by sea, sinking three troop transport ships. The German armored and motorized units in the southeastern Caucasus are continuing to advance towards the Grozny oil fields and the Caspian Sea. The Soviet army between the Volga River and the Don River is about to collapse. The Soviet rear railway lines have also been bombed by German aircraft. The remaining Soviet troops in the northern part of the Don River bend are being successively defeated by the German army. The German army has established bridgeheads near the Volga River bend and on the east bank of the Don River. Yesterday was the 50th day of the German summer offensive. It seems appropriate to review the achievements of the German army and its allied forces. Chida Tsusai admitted in a secret order issued on July 28 that the Soviet Union had lost 70,000,000 civilians, and the German-occupied area south of the Don River still had a population of approximately 6,000,000. The number of Soviet soldiers killed and wounded and Soviet civilians who died of starvation is between 12,000,000 and 15,000,000. The total population of the Soviet Union in 1939 was 191,700,000, but it has now lost half of its population. The Soviet Union has also lost approximately 60% of its coal production, approximately 60% of its iron production, and approximately two-thirds of its manganese production. Approximately two-thirds of grains and livestock have also been lost.

Stockholm, 17th (Haitong News Agency) – A British broadcaster stated that the British government believes that the next sixty days are the most crucial for the success or failure of this war. Regarding the battles in the Caucasus and Volga regions, we will not be able to breathe a sigh of relief until two months later.

### Allied Conference Moves to Near East; Moscow Talks Conclude, New Plan for Military Aid to Soviet Union to be Formulated

Stockholm, 17th (Domei News Agency) – According to a London report, the Allied conference in Moscow was originally shrouded in mystery. It is now rumored that the venue has been moved to somewhere in the Near East. According to reliable sources in London, there will be no official announcement regarding this conference this week. However, it is believed that the situation of the meeting in Moscow has come to an end.

Stockholm, 17th (Haitong News Agency) – "The Evening News" London dispatch states that the Allied conference previously held in Moscow has now been moved elsewhere. Only a few well-informed sources in London know the location of the Allied representatives. The location must be somewhere between Moscow and Cairo, and the representatives participating are probably on an inspection tour. According to recent news, officials are still keeping the details of the conference secret, and it is expected that nothing will be revealed before the weekend. Because a certain important person has postponed his return to London, there are rumors that the Allied representatives will travel to India or Chongqing. Another rumor claims that the delegation has already set off for the United States via Vladivostok. A Stockholm dispatch points out that these speculations are not very accurate. However, it is more likely that the conference has been moved to the Near East.

Stockholm, 17th (Haitong News Agency) – The British press unanimously believes that the issue of Allied aid to the Soviet Union is the main issue to be discussed at the Moscow conference. Several newspapers also stated that the Allies have drafted a new plan to supply the Soviet Union with military supplies. London's "Sunday Times" stated that the Soviet Union urged close cooperation between the British, American, and Soviet general staffs, and it is heard that the Allied plans to launch offensives in the Mediterranean, Pacific, and Soviet front lines were also discussed at the meeting.

Churchill's Purpose in Visiting the Soviet Union

Berlin, 16th (German News Agency) – According to news obtained tonight, Churchill has been in Moscow since August 13th, accompanied by several senior British military officers and Roosevelt's special envoy Harriman. U.S. Ambassador to Turkey Steinhardt has also arrived in Moscow. Churchill traveled by plane via Cairo and Tehran to Moscow, and his trip was very secret. The fact that Churchill made the long journey to visit Moscow in person shows that he has great anxiety about the future development of the war.

Lisbon, 17th (Domei News Agency) – According to news from London, Churchill and Stalin met for a total of three days from Wednesday to Saturday of last week. Attendees included Harriman, Brooke, Wavell, Molotov, and Voroshilov.

Berlin, 17th (Haitong News Agency) – A Swedish report cites Swiss diplomatic sources as pointing out that Churchill's recent visit to Moscow had three purposes:
1. Churchill, in view of the critical situation in the Soviet Union, believes that it is necessary to take action to maintain the Soviet Union's continued resistance.
2. Churchill believes that it is necessary for him to personally investigate the current situation in the Soviet Union and explain the issue of the Second Front.
3. Churchill wants to study whether the Soviet system can last. It is heard that Roosevelt's representative Harriman and several British military experts accompanied Churchill.

### From Lecturing to Imprisonment (I)

— Tie Ming

I am least afraid of speaking. No matter what language—Mandarin, Cantonese, English—I use three parts for every one part I learn. People think I have a talent for learning languages; but in reality, it's just that I'm thick-skinned and bold. Learning a language only requires these two abilities.

Since arriving in Europe, I have felt strongly that English doesn't work on the Continent and that I must learn more French and German. I already understand some German, enough to get by; so whenever I have the opportunity, I try my best to improve my French.

My French is, of course, very basic. The verb conjugations make my head ache; the genders of nouns are completely illogical, and often the opposite of German. But I don't care about these things. Every time I go to France, I speak haphazardly, and when I can't make myself understood, I use the most common French gestures as much as possible. Fortunately, the French are generally more amiable than the British. When they see a foreigner speaking French poorly, they are not only not annoyed, but very sympathetic, and they understand even what is not clearly spoken.

In Paris, I met a member of the same family as an old colleague, Chief Technician Zhang. He was studying political science and was a long-time Parisian. After one meeting, then two, we quickly hit it off. He suggested that I give a few lectures at the "Chinese Academic Lecture Series" at the University of Paris. According to him, this kind of lecture is not easy to get. He said that, at least in recent years, he hadn't heard of any Chinese university professor being invited to give a lecture.

Okay! Lecturing isn't difficult. After being a professor for more than ten years, am I afraid of a few academic lectures? My French isn't good, but that doesn't matter either. The French are very understanding—and the most profound truths can only be understood intuitively, not verbally.

Lecturing in France is truly a very valuable thing: for China, it can be said to be a work of fostering friendly relations and cultural exchange. I planned to talk about some problems in theoretical chemistry, because agricultural chemistry, which I have researched more thoroughly, is too localized and not suitable as a topic for this kind of lecture. French theoretical chemists told me many unheard-of new discoveries. This is something I wouldn't get in Germany. The Germans are most diligent. They read all reports published in any language; and their publications are more than sufficient to include all their research. So, when you go to Germany to lecture, you can't tell them anything, and they have nothing new to tell you. In France, it's different. They are often very unfamiliar with research from other countries, and just when you think French science is backward and has no new progress, something unexpected often arises. An unknown Frenchman—sometimes even a French woman—has just discovered the newest and most earth-shattering theory. Radioactivity is an excellent example, as is wave mechanics. This newest theory not only made Professor Einstein's theory of relativity relatively simple and crude like child's play, but also unintentionally exiled Eugene Galois to Devil's Island, and me—I hope—sent me to the Ambert local prison.

I originally wanted to publish this memoir in the Chinese Chemical Journal, then this long "prelude" could be deleted. But the readers of this journal would definitely ask me what I was doing on Rue Cuyas at eleven o'clock on the night of June 28th? How did that toothless person recognize me? And how did I understand something about the relationship of wave mechanics to chemistry? There were many announcements hanging near the Sorbonne for my lectures at the University of Paris. The latest issue of the Illustrated Weekly (Llllusrtation) also published a photo of me, with a pseudo-biographical note below. That day was my last lecture. After finishing, I sat at the Cafes Soufflet on the corner of Bonlevard St. Miehel and Rue des Ecoles, drinking many beers with French colleagues, including the famous chemists Henriot and his wife. At the table behind us, one of their students and a young woman were playing cards. This situation, not to mention that you couldn't find it in the snack shops of Zhenru Jiangwan University, and when I was in America, it was during Prohibition, so of course it couldn't be compared, and I hadn't even seen it in Oxford or Cambridge, where drinking is common.

The toothless man was dressed exceptionally raggedly, with a hungry look on his face. Most people in Paris have work to do, so it's rare to see someone so destitute. He approached me step by step and said, "Please look at this. If you want to know more, please come with me." After he finished speaking, he retreated to a dark corner by the door. I was baffled, and looked at the piece of paper he had put in my hand. Huh! Isn't that part of the carbon wave equation? I remember that carbon seems to have forty-two simultaneous wave partial differential equations. If someone can solve these equations, it won't be difficult to thoroughly understand all the hidden properties of this element. A beggar might have copied some strange things to use as a guise for deception, but this person didn't seem like it, because not only was the handwriting clear and the symbols correct, but I believed that those completely new arrangements had not yet been published.

I don't have any special hobbies in my life, just curiosity. I hope to know a little about everything new, and my ability to understand theoretical chemistry relatively well has also been rewarded by this curiosity. At that time, my curiosity couldn't help but erupt, and I stood up and walked to the man's side. He waited for me to approach, and said in a very low voice: "Midnight, come to the Bar du Progres at Portedela Villette." Lin's voice trembled, indicating that he was feeling great fear, and at the same time he made a gesture, telling me to leave quickly.

It was an hour before midnight. Looking at the situation, I expected something strange to happen. I wasn't timid, after all, I was a poor man, but I also had to make some necessary preparations, especially being in a foreign country. So I said goodbye to Henriot and the others, and carefully made sure that no one was watching me, and quickly walked into the Cafed Earcourt, and while drinking coffee, wrote a postcard to my friend Mr. Zhang—most of the cafes in Paris sell postcards, and there are mailboxes at the door, which is very convenient for me—briefly explaining the situation that night, and asking him to call me the next day at noon; if I hadn't returned, please report it to the police immediately. This postcard was written in Chinese, so it could avoid being read by others.

I went into the subway to take the underground train. Villette Gate is in the northeast corner of Paris, and I had visited a slaughterhouse there. On the train, I tried my best to calm myself, but I think a very observant person could still see the look of panic on my face.

The Bar du Progres is a very small and dark bar, the interior is exactly the same as thousands of other small bars in Paris, with that long counter, a fat old woman behind the counter, and all kinds of wine bottles behind the old woman. In the corner there was a small table with only two seats, facing the door, where you could see all the movements at the door. I went to occupy this table and ordered a glass of Canet wine. If it were in the Montmartre area, it would be the time for singing and drinking, but in this deserted small bar, besides me, there was only a truck driver gesticulating to the landlady about how his truck had been hit by someone else. Cars in Paris, as usual, are reckless and impolite, making passengers who come to Paris for the first time unable to stop their hair from standing on end. There are not too many accidents, but once there is a collision, whether there is a right side is very problematic! The driver was also putting all the blame and guilt completely on the other party, and grumbling that he had been delayed a lot in his sleeping time because of this.

The clock struck twelve, and that friend from Rue Cuyas came and sat opposite me without a word. I ordered a glass of Canet wine for him too, and added several more glasses in a row. His missing teeth were just a part of his great wounds. At this time, I saw clearly that the scar on his face was an old scar, perhaps a memento of the last European war. He spoke very quickly and softly for about an hour, mostly in not very standard rural French with a heavy accent. Although he tried his best to use ordinary words and simple syntax, I still had a hard time listening, so in important places he also added a few English words, and even mixed in many German scientific terms.

His expression was very unnatural, obviously harboring great terror, but it seemed that his terror had become natural, a phenomenon caused by long-term danger.

The gist of our conversation was like this—I believe that what I remember will not have major errors:

"Do you know about Eugene Galois?"

"I heard that he committed murder and was exiled to Devil's Island. But I don't believe that a great mathematician would be so blinded by greed that he would murder a friend for money. Haven't some people wanted to file an appeal? If there is anything I can do to help, I am happy to comply."

"Very good, but too late! He died last month. Several prisoners there kept parrots as pets, and a plague broke out, and the terrible parrot disease was transmitted to him. Because he died, I am telling you this. Since Watt invented the steam engine, there has been no greater invention than his, and his being harmed is because he knew too much. After you listen to me, you may become the richest person in the world, but you will also be qualified to be assassinated. As long as someone sees you with me, there may be immediate danger. If you are afraid, we had better leave."

### British Officials and Citizens, Etc. Yesterday Withdrew and Returned Home. The Kamakura Maru Weighed Anchor at About 5 PM. More Than 3,000 Foreign Nationals Have Been Evacuated.

The Japanese Mail Steamer Company's large 14,000-ton transport ship, Kamakura Maru, weighed anchor at about 5 PM yesterday from the Wa Wharf in Pudong, carrying 907 British and other Allied officials and citizens, evacuating to Portuguese East Africa's Magus. The entire journey from Shanghai to the Philippines takes six weeks. After the evacuated personnel arrive on the other side and exchange for Japanese nationals, they will transfer and return to England, and are expected to reach London in late October. Yesterday's evacuated personnel included 459 officials, including 369 British, 31 Polish, 28 Belgian, 23 Dutch, 6 Norwegian, and 2 Greek; 448 ordinary expatriates, including 167 British expatriates in Shanghai, 163 British expatriates in other ports, 10 Belgian, 14 Norwegian, 3 Dutch, 7 Greek, 47 Polish, 11 Allied expatriates in other ports, and 25 others.

Officials and Expatriates Boarded Separately

The Allied personnel who withdrew yesterday were one of the largest groups since the evacuation work began. To avoid crowding, the evacuees were divided into two groups to board the ship. The first group was ordinary expatriates, who departed in four groups at 6:00 AM, 6:20 AM, 6:30 AM, and 7:45 AM yesterday morning from the intersection of Avenue Joffre and Route Tenant de la Tour, the Columbia Country Club, Hua Mao Apartments, and the Racecourse, in 15 specially prepared buses, and drove to the New Customs Wharf to assemble, and were transferred by several ferry ships such as the Jinling Maru to the Kamakura Maru. The officials then boarded in 14 buses from various assembly points to the New Customs Wharf between 12:00 PM and 1:00 PM. Yesterday's scene at the New Customs Wharf was very lively, but the military and police security was even more stringent than during the evacuation of American officials and expatriates and the last British expatriates. The number of people seeing them off was shoulder-to-shoulder, about a thousand people, because there were many celebrities on the sea among the evacuees.

Gentry, Merchants, and Celebrities Were Allowed to Withdraw First

The ranks of those who withdrew yesterday included the British Consul General in Shanghai, George; British Embassy Chinese Affairs Counselor Backhouse; Polish Ambassador to Japan, Roman Knoll; Belgian Minister to Beijing, Kim; Dutch Chargé d'Affaires to Beijing, Flash; former Inspector General of the Maritime Customs, Mr. and Mrs. Merger; Customs Commissioner, Mr. and Mrs. Rouffaud; HSBC Shanghai General Manager, Mr. Hawes; Moutrie & Co. General Manager, Marten; former Chairman of the Municipal Council, Phillipe; Acting Chief Inspector of the Police Department, Smith; Political Director, Robertson; Director of the Industrial and Social Affairs Department, Ms. Hsing Te; Far East Editor of the English Evening Post & Mercury and Editor of the Far East Magazine, Woodhead; Reuters Far East Manager, Blom; and London Daily Mail special correspondent to Shanghai, Feng Jiu, etc. Generally speaking, the British Consulate General in Shanghai and the British Embassy offices were all evacuated. As for the expatriates, according to the opinions of the London government, famous people were allowed to be evacuated first, so many celebrities from the British banking and business circles in this city were evacuated. In addition, 12 people from the Axis countries also attached to the transport to return to Europe.

The Total Number of Evacuees Has Exceeded 3,000

It is understood that the consultation between Japan and the Allied countries on the exchange of officials and citizens was first announced by the Swiss Consul General in Shanghai, Fontanier, in March of this year. Subsequently, the registration of diplomatic and consular officials and ordinary expatriates from Britain, the United States, and other countries in this city began, and after several months of preparation, the first evacuation began at the end of June. The Conte Verde and Asama Maru each carried 1,500 evacuees from Shanghai and Yokohama to East Africa. Earlier this month, the Tatsuta Maru carried 900 Japanese and Chinese evacuees to the Philippines. Including yesterday's departing Kamakura Maru, the Allied officials and citizens evacuated from various parts of the Far East have reached 3,300. As for whether the evacuation will continue in the future, it is said that it has not yet entered the negotiation stage, and all progress must be judged based on past achievements. It is rumored that after the Conte Verde and Asama Maru return to Japan, they will continue to be dispatched to deal with the evacuation. The official has not given a definite statement.

### Calculating the Area of Sublet Housing Does Not Require Outside Help

The Municipal Council's Information Office announced that the Bureau has received reports that some people have been soliciting subleases from sub-landlords to measure the area of the subleased portion of the house and charge fees, etc. It has been found that calculating the area of the sublease is a simple procedure in accordance with the regulations of the Sublease Housing License Office. It only needs to be handled by the sub-landlord and the sub-tenant through consultation, without the need for outside help. If you encounter someone who claims to be measuring and charging fees in the future, you should immediately report to the above-mentioned office in Room 374, Municipal Council Building, 180 Fuzhou Road, for verification.

### Collection of Sublease Licenses Yesterday Started with Fines

The collection of sublease housing licenses for the next quarter of this year has been issued by the Municipal Council Building on Hankou Road and various district offices since July 1. So far, it has been a month and a half. A certain staff member of the Sublease Housing License Management Office told reporters that there were more than 35,000 sub-landlords in the Public Concession who went to collect them during this period. However, this is still less than the previous quarter of this year, so the results are not satisfactory. It is now known that from yesterday (17th), the deadline has passed, and a fine of 10 yuan must be paid separately. If you reapply for the license after September 1, you must pay an additional 5 yuan fine. After September 15, the authorities will send personnel to investigate. If the sub-landlord refuses to obtain the license, the authorities will file a complaint with the court in accordance with the law and handle it strictly without pardon.

### False Accusation Due to Grudges Leads to Conviction

Sun Shengchang, a Ningbo native residing at No. 18 Anshun Lane, Kangti Road, is 53 years old and works as a wool merchant. Previously, he had bad feelings with the sub-landlord Qiu Zhang due to arrears in rent. He filed a complaint with the French patrol, accusing Qiu Zhang's daughter Qiu Lizhu of hiring people to commit assault and steal his 10,000 yuan in Central Reserve Certificates. The captain rejected the case because the accusation was false. Sun was still unwilling and filed a complaint with the patrol last month, accusing the head of the Lianbao and Baojia of colluding to steal two pieces of white broadcloth worth 20,000 yuan. Captain Geng sent detectives to investigate and found that Sun's accusations were completely false and intended to frame others, which was very abhorrent. Sun was detained, investigated, and sent to court for public prosecution on charges of false accusation. After interrogation and final hearing, Sun Shengchang was sentenced to one year and six months of imprisonment yesterday.

### Firefighter Chops His Mistress and Jumps Off Building in Desperation to Commit Suicide. Sun's Wife Suffers Serious Head Injuries. When Patrol Arrived, the Firefighter Fell to His Death.

Xu Alin, a native of Jiangbei, is 43 years old this year. He is currently a firefighter at the French Concession Fire Brigade No. 33 on Rue Lestock. He is acquainted with Sun Fengying (30 years old this year), a woman from Yangzhou who lives at No. 19 Rue Sainte-Marie, and rented No. 21 Rixin Lane, Jin Shenfu Road, Dapuqiao, as a place for secret rendezvous. Recently, he learned that Sun had made a new love and held a grudge. At 12:00 noon on the 16th, Xu met Sun at the home of Sun's younger sister at No. 256 Rue Gascoyne. Xu immediately reprimanded Sun. The two disagreed and started arguing. First, they argued verbally, then Xu wielded a knife and slashed violently at Sun Fengying, who suffered head injuries and bled profusely. Sun was injured and escaped through the back door, shouting for help. Xu chased after her. When Sun saw the patrol approaching upon hearing the sound, she turned back to the front door of No. 256 Rue Gascoyne and hid inside. Xu also chased in, rushed upstairs, entered the front room, saw sharp scissors on the table, and immediately used the scissors to stab his abdomen. After going downstairs, he went up to the third floor and climbed onto the roof from the skylight. Seeing the patrol shouting below, Xu, in a panic, conceived the idea of ending his life and climbed to the overstreet building and jumped off to commit suicide. He fell, injuring his head and feet internally, and could not get up. He was sent to Guangci Hospital by the patrol, but died due to his serious injuries. The body was sent to the coroner's office by the patrol. Yesterday, his father Xu Xuegao claimed the body for burial. As for Sun Fengying, she suffered severe head injuries and is still being treated in the hospital.

### ### Idle Talk on the Qixi Festival

— Feng Liutang

### The Once-a-Year Heavenly River Meeting

In the human world, there are many happy couples; how could there not be lovers in the heavens? This is the origin of the Qixi (Double Seventh) myth of the Cowherd and Weaver Girl meeting on the Milky Way.

According to ancient legends, the Cowherd and Weaver Girl live on opposite sides of the Milky Way (called the Silver River because its starlight and color resemble silver), visible but unattainable. Magpies use their wings to form a bridge on the evening of the seventh day of the seventh month for their once-a-year meeting. The Jingchu Chronicle of Seasonal Customs also states, "On the seventh day of the seventh month, the Cowherd and Weaver Girl meet on the Milky Way." Note that the Jingchu Chronicle of Seasonal Customs was selected by Zong Lin of the Liang Dynasty, who was a native of Chu, so what he recorded was about matters in the Jingchu region. Before the Liang Dynasty, there was also the "Autumn Wind Swallow Song" by Emperor Wen of Wei, which also sang of this matter.

"The autumn wind is bleak, the weather is cold, the grass and trees wither, and the dew turns to frost. The flocks of swallows bid farewell and return, the magpies fly south. Thinking of my lord traveling far away, my intestines are filled with longing. I earnestly desire to return to my homeland, why does my lord linger and entrust himself to another place? Your humble concubine toils alone, guarding the empty chamber. Worry comes, thinking of my lord, I dare not forget, tears fall and soak my clothes. I pick up the zither and play, uttering a clear melody. The short song and soft sigh cannot last long, the bright moon shines on my bed. The Milky Way flows westward, the night is not yet over, the Cowherd and Weaver Girl gaze at each other from afar, what crime have you committed to be separated by the River Bridge?" This depicts a young woman in an empty boudoir moved by autumn thoughts, also feeling the "Cowherd and Weaver Girl gazing at each other from afar." Thus, it is known that the Qixi meeting aims to make up for the deficiencies of the celestial lovers, already from the Han and Wei Dynasties.

Brief Talk on the Cowherd and Weaver Girl Stars

Why must the Cowherd and Weaver Girl meet only on the Qixi Festival? This is due to the relationship of stellar movements. It is precisely the beginning of autumn, the heat has not yet dissipated, looking up at the sky, the Milky Way is vast, winding like a river, the two stars face each other from afar, sparkling and dazzling, how could it not move people's distant thoughts, arouse people's attention, and create myths? Using the human world to represent the heavens is also a common thought of mankind.

The names of the Cowherd and Weaver Girl stars have been around since ancient times. The "Da Dong" chapter of the Book of Songs, Minor Odes of the Kingdom says: "In the sky is the Milky Way, shining brightly; Look at that Weaver Girl, all day seven times she weaves; Although she weaves seven times, she does not produce a pattern; Look at that Cowherd, he does not use it to carry goods."

The Records of the Grand Historian and the Book of Han both have accounts. The Book of Han says: "The Southern Dipper is the temple, north of it is the Jian star, the Jian star is the flag. The Cowherd is the sacrificial ox. North of it is the He Drum; the big star is the supreme general; left is the left general; right is the right general. North of it is the Weaver Girl, the Weaver Girl is the granddaughter of the Heavenly Emperor."

The Book of Jin speaks in more detail, here is the summary: "The Weaver Girl has three stars, at the end of the Heavenly Discipline, she is the heavenly woman: in charge of fruits, melons, silks, fabrics, treasures, and jewels." "The He Drum has three stars, north of the Cowherd, it is the heavenly drum, in charge of military affairs, in the middle is the axe. One day there are three martial arts, in charge of the emperor's three generals." "The Cowherd has six stars, the bridge of the sky, in charge of sacrificial affairs." "The Weaver Girl star is today's main star of the Lyra constellation. It must wait until the handle of the Big Dipper points south (this refers to the Big Dipper), and it is seen as if it is on top of the head, this is the scene in the sixth and seventh months of summer and autumn. There are two theories about the Cowherd star, one is that the Ox asterism in the twenty-eight mansions is regarded as it, the so-called six Cowherd stars. The other is that the He Drum is regarded as it, belonging to the Aquila constellation, separated from the Weaver Girl star by the river, almost in a straight line. The He Drum is commonly called the Carrying Pole Star, with two stars on the left and right, and a star in the middle, resembling a carrying pole carrying objects. The Cowherd belongs to the Capricorn constellation, and the Southern Dipper belongs to the Sagittarius constellation, both of which are one of the twelve zodiac signs.

The ancients called the Ox and Dipper referring to this. For example, Su Dongpo's "Ode to the Red Cliff" says: "Soon the moon rose above the eastern mountain, wandering between the Ox and Dipper," which is the scene on the night of the sixteenth of the seventh month. Also, the "Preface to the Pavilion of Prince Teng": "The essence of things and heavenly treasures, the dragon light shoots at the ruins of the Ox and Dipper." Considering that the Ox and Dipper are all stars in the south, the ancients used them to refer to the area of today's Jiangxi province, that is, the ancient areas of Yuzhang and Fengcheng, which are the ruins of the Ox and Dipper.

The Origin of Begging for Skills Emphasizes Needlework

When did the practice of begging for skills on the Qixi Festival begin? I have read few books and do not know the details. However, since the Jingchu Chronicle of Seasonal Customs has this saying, it is known that it was prevalent in the Liang Dynasty. The saying goes: "On the seventh day of the seventh month, the Cowherd and Weaver Girl meet on the Milky Way, women tie colored threads and thread seven-hole needles to beg for skills; if there are spiderwebs on melons, it is considered successful."

Since the Weaver Girl is a weaver, begging for skills is also a matter of women's needlework, which is done on the evening of the seventh day. The Qixi Festival is close to the waxing gibbous moon, and the moonlight is not yet bright, so being able to thread a seven-hole needle under the moonlight indicates superior eyesight. Needlework and weaving are fine and detailed, relying on eyesight, so they compete with each other in this aspect. This is why Cui Hao's poem says, "In the city of Chang'an, the moonlight is like silk, every family holds needles and threads tonight." In the past, there were two ways to test the quality of eyesight, one was to thread a needle under the moonlight, and the other was to see that the sixth star of the Big Dipper, Kaiyang, is a binary star, and there is a small star next to it, those who can see it must have strong eyesight.

"Xizi" refers to small spiders with long legs. It is said that seeing them descending with silk threads indicates good fortune, so they are named "happy spiders." On the Qixi Festival, fruits and melons are displayed in the courtyard to beg for skills, and those who encounter happy spiders weaving webs are considered to have obtained skills, which is very possible in the summer.

The "Record of Scenery and Objects of the Imperial Capital" says that needles are reflected in water during the day, and their shapes are used to determine whether one has obtained skills. The saying goes: "On the seventh day of the seventh month, women expose a basin of water to the sun at noon, after a while, a film forms on the water surface, and when a needle is thrown in, it floats, then the shadow of the needle at the bottom of the water is observed. If it forms clouds, flowers, birds, or animal shadows, or shoe, scissor, or eggplant shadows, it is said that skills have been obtained."

According to the principles of water surface tension, throwing a needle into water and reflecting light will result in various shapes. The film is not only produced after exposure to sunlight. Some people also fill a bowl with water and submerge leaves of balsam flowers in it, leaving it out in the dew overnight on Qixi. The next morning, a needle is thrown in. A thick needle shadow indicates clumsiness, while a weaving shadow indicates skill.

I have always suspected that since the legend of the Cowherd and Weaver Girl appeared in the Wei Dynasty, the practice of begging for skills is also thought to have begun around the same time, or it may be based on the Needle God. Xue Lingyun, the beautiful concubine of Emperor Wen of Wei, was skilled in embroidery. Even in the depths of the palace, without using candles, she could still make garments in a standing position. The palace called her the Needle God. Consequently, women followed suit, regarding it as a beautiful story. Who knows if the practice of threading needles under the moonlight on the Qixi Festival was not inspired by Lingyun?

The Palace of Eternal Life on the Seventh Day of the Seventh Month

Since Bai Juyi's "Song of Everlasting Regret" became a household name, "On the seventh day of the seventh month, in the Palace of Eternal Life, at midnight when no one is around, they whisper to each other. In heaven, may we be birds that fly wing to wing; on earth, may we be trees with intertwined branches. Heaven and earth may have an end, but this regret will last forever."

Is well-known. It seems that the Qixi Heavenly River meeting is not just something that happens in the heavens; in the human world too, feelings are deep and intentions are lingering, entangled endlessly. When it comes to love, many things go wrong, falsehoods become truths, the deepest love turns into a source of resentment, confusion and disorder reign, and foolish fantasies are beyond reason and language. Therefore, those who hate love are better off than the Cowherd and Weaver Girl, with endless longing in two places, easy to part but difficult to meet. If spirits can communicate, why would there be such tragedies of separation and reunion as the Palace of Eternal Life and Mawei Slope? That is why Du Fu has a poem praising the Cowherd and Weaver Girl: "The Cowherd comes out of the west of the river, the Weaver Girl comes out of the east, for ten thousand ages they look at each other, who sees them together on the Qixi Festival? Divine light is difficult to wait for, this matter is always hazy, suddenly their spirits merge, why must they meet in autumn?"

Heaven and Earth Are the Same

Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty, who shook the remote regions and made the Han people famous, was born on the seventh day of the seventh month at dawn. Emperor Daowu of the Tuoba Wei, the first to declare himself emperor, Gui, was also born on the seventh day of the seventh month. Wei Chu's body was twice the size of an ordinary child, and the hidden umbilical cord of the Tibetan compatriots later became a forest. However, there were also emperors who died on the seventh day of the seventh month, such as the Latter Emperor of the Song Dynasty in the Six Dynasties, and Prince Baling, Xiu Ruo, but they were all killed and did not die a natural death. There were even those who were born on the seventh day of the seventh month and also died on the seventh day of the seventh month, such as Tang Dynasty Chancellor Qiao Lin. During the Zhu Ci Rebellion, Lin submitted to Bi. When the capital was recovered, Lin, as the former chancellor, lost his integrity and betrayed justice, and was not pardoned even in his old age. Lin sighed before his execution, "I was born on the seventh day of the seventh month, and I die on this day, is it not fate!"

In short, all myths are created from human emotions, entrusted to the gods, and entrusted to the spirits. With "the Southern Dipper as the temple," the "Cowherd is the sacrifice." With the Milky Way as the river, the nine stars of Tianjin are the bridge. Which human being does not wish "all lovers to become married couples"? Therefore, the eternally unchanging Cowherd and Weaver Girl stars are fabricated to meet once a year on the seventh day of the seventh month. In China, which has always embraced the agricultural ideal of men plowing and women weaving, it is said that the Weaver Girl and Cowherd in heaven are also engaged in plowing and weaving. The shape of the star is like a shuttle, so it is named the Weaver Girl; Westerners think it is like a violin, so it is named the Lyra. It can be seen that all realms are created by the mind, heaven and earth are the same, without humans, what is heaven, without heart, what are humans, all things past and present, should be viewed in this way. Therefore, my writing about the Qixi Festival and begging for skills today is also meddlesome! However, using it to pass the long day, to relieve the summer heat, and to find coolness in troubles is also a joy in itself.

Letter

To whom it may concern, according to the statement of the person concerned, Zhang Xintai, upon reading today's news section of Xin Shen and Liang newspapers concerning the rental dispute of currency values, much of what was stated does not conform to the facts. For example, it was said that there were as many as 124 tenants in the three houses, with 24 households, etc. In fact, many of the residents were employees and workers of Yongyu and Long tea firms, and the three tenants were a minority. Also, regarding the renewal of the new contract, at this time, the ratio of new currency to old currency is 77%, and the new contract clearly states that the rent does not distinguish between new and old legal tender, and is willing to pay the current legal tender in full without discount. Zhuo Huapu's apprentice, Zhang Xintai, suddenly regretted the agreement and hid the new contract, etc., which is not factual. Therefore, he specially commissioned your lawyer to send a letter to the two newspaper offices for correction. Based on this, we hereby send this letter, hoping that your newspaper office will make a correction. Respectfully addressed to the Shanghai News Editorial Department of Shen Bao, Ganlin Lawyer, August 17th.

Lost Watch Announcement

To whom it may concern, on August 11th at 8:30 AM, I, the undersigned, found a watch at the Grand Self-Ringing Clock on Xiaosha Ferry Road, and immediately handed it over to Patrolman No. 3404. I hope the owner will see this announcement and quickly go to the Putuo Road Police Station to claim it. Gu Zuliang.

### China Youth Corps Leader Broadcasts; Invited by Minister of Information Yokoyama

Qian Dan, the head of the China Youth Corps, was invited by Minister of Information Yokoyama to broadcast at the Greater Shanghai Broadcasting Station at 10:25 last night. The text of the speech is recorded below:

It has been exactly five full years since the August 13th Incident. The suffering of the Shanghai people caused by the war is truly indescribable. The only way to relieve this suffering is peace.

Our ideal goal is, of course, comprehensive peace. However, comprehensive peace cannot be achieved overnight. Comprehensive peace must start from local peace, and local peace must start from stabilizing society and people's livelihood. How can we achieve local peace? I believe that only pure youth can take on the work of peace, so we must start with training youth. However, should we start with student youth or vocational youth? This is indeed a question worth considering. According to my observation, in the current environment in China, if we want to train youth, we should start with youth who have already entered society. We do not harbor the extravagant hope of achieving comprehensive peace immediately. We hope to have local peace first. Now our corps is starting to work for local peace, we are starting local peace in Shanghai. Then, how do we start this local peace work? I think there are four points: 1. Understanding Japan, 2. Social progress, 3. Training in normal thinking, 4. Promotion of production capacity.

Understanding Japan We cannot look at Japan superficially, we must thoroughly understand Japan. Now Japan, since the development of the government's central centralization movement, the strengthening of economic control by the people, and the actions of all political institutions, has gradually progressed, so that the country has a unified leadership and is on the right track. The government uses the power of national politics to solve social and livelihood problems, so that people can live a disciplined and peaceful life. I saw in Japan that the lives of the Japanese people, under iron-like discipline and a strong controlled economy, are more serious and difficult than the current situation in China by hundreds of times. However, the Japanese people can live in an extremely pleasant atmosphere. What is the reason for this? Because their love for the country is at the cost of any sacrifice, and their support for the country's policies is absolute. The only purpose is the strength of the country, and individual freedom is not considered. This is the spirit of public service and abiding by the law, and strict observance of discipline. We see that the Japanese youth, under the will of the country above all else, have the spirit of strict observance of discipline, and we should deeply feel the necessity of training our country's youth in the same way. Therefore, we must first have a thorough understanding of Japan and learn from it.

How to Stabilize Society and People's Livelihood How can we stabilize society and people's livelihood? We know that the current institutions for stabilizing society in China have been destroyed, and the elements of social production have been dispersed. Therefore, how to restore production institutions, how to concentrate production elements, and how to train production youth are indeed several important issues at present. The training of production youth who bear the mission of stabilizing society is the most urgent task. Because production youth, in the current environment, especially in China's national conditions, must first train and concentrate them. You think, can those parents who cannot produce still talk about educating their children who do not produce? So, I think the training of academic youth can be the second step of the work. Now Japan is helping us do this work of stabilizing society. Although they are helping us, we should show a great fearless spirit to strive for anything that does not meet our ideals, because Japan is not unwilling to accept our proposals. It is because we have always given up the national position and do not strive for them. I think since Japan loves China, they will definitely accept our righteous proposals. The most feared thing is that we have no proposals.

How to Promote Production Function How is the production function promoted? We see that after August 13th, Shanghai's production institutions have been almost completely destroyed. But conversely, the only point of existence of the Shanghai market is speculation, because the success of speculation is easy, creating two bad mentalities for the youth, that is, the mentality of luck and dependence. Therefore, under the joint construction and cultivation of many production youth, Shanghai has invisibly created an international speculative market. We should engage in production in a normal way, that is, to run more industries, run more factories, revive the countryside, eliminate speculation, eliminate improper commercial operations and illegal transactions, and then strengthen the controlled economy, and use the income from normal production for proper expenses. This is the only way to improve the production mechanism. However, now, affected by the war, the only normal production mechanism that exists has also been destroyed. If we want to revive it and promote it, the only way is to understand the benefits of the controlled economy. Superficially, people seem to have a layer of bondage to the controlled economy, but in fact the method of control is reasonable, regular, and scientific. It can promote the normal development of the production mechanism and it can also promote political progress on the right track.

Training in Normal Thinking We study the methods of ideological training for Chinese youth in the past, which can be said to have been completely used by politicians, so our corps adopts good organizations and eliminates bad methods of operation, and transforms the organizational law into flexible operation, successfully creating this unified and centralized organization, and implementing an action of absolute obedience and strict discipline to organize the youth, to train the youth. The goals of training our youth are: 1. We must be loyal to the country, 2. We must be loyal to our leaders, 3. We must be loyal to our duties, 4. We must have a courageous spirit, 5. We must have courageous actions, 6. We must have a clean spirit, 7. We must have the ability to know shame, 8. We must put the public before the private, 9. We must have a disciplined life, 10. We must seek self-reliance.

This youth, who bears the mission of peace, must cultivate a politically-minded training work under the principle of transcending national supremacy, and at the same time have the spirit of self-reliance in society and people's livelihood, maintain this useful body, and use it for the greatest path of saving the country. "As for the friendly relationship between our corps and the people of the Axis countries, especially Japan, they deeply sympathize with the fact that our corps is purely based on the people's position. They believe that the ideological expression of the people must be expressed by a purely people's organization, especially the youth organization, which must be led by pure and uncolored youth. I have been working on this movement for a year, spending countless efforts, and going through many arduous struggles.

After so many hardships, I showed the greatest fearless spirit to show the attitude of our corps, and finally gained the complete sympathy of all parties. Now our corps will soon be formally established. Recently, the Japanese Consulate and the Ministry of Information have repeatedly invited me, hoping that I will express the most solemn position as soon as possible, so today I will briefly tell you what is in my heart."

### New Buyers Gather: Public Bonds Slowly Rise; Type A Reaches the Forty-Yuan Mark

Yesterday's unified public bond market continued the momentum of Saturday and rose slowly again. As soon as the morning session opened, everyone was in high spirits and new buyers gathered like clouds, so the opening prices of each bond were already high. However, in the middle of the session, large investors sold off, so Type C retreated from 9.20 yuan to below 9 yuan. However, because the overall momentum was very strong, even with the selling of large investors, buyers still purchased strongly, and were not shaken. Therefore, sellers found it difficult and retreated, and the market was temporarily controlled by buyers, resulting in a shortage of chips. As a result, each bond closed near its high price. Considering the strong foundation of each bond, they are expected to rise further. However, whether they can break through the 40-yuan mark for Type C is a turning point. If they break through and stand firm, then good prospects can be seen again. Otherwise, a retreat may be seen first, and then higher prices will be seen. The initial buying and selling for the whole city was absorbed by Tongli, Tongshun, and Hongda, etc., and high prices were seen. In the middle of the session, Tongyuan, Runde, and Fuhua made efforts, so there was a temporary small return. Soon, buyers continued their efforts, and their momentum did not abate. Each bond finally closed steadily. The turnover was about 2 million yuan. The list is shown below:

Shunchang Stock Company, which has been in preparation for a long time, officially opened today. Chen Runbiao is the manager. The head office is located at Room 410, Jinxing Building, No. 505 Henan Road. For business development, a business department has also been established at No. 524 Securities Building, Jiujiang Road.

### Chinese Stocks Have an Underlying Firm Momentum; New Pharmaceutical Stocks Are Especially Outstanding

Yesterday's Chinese stock market had an underlying firm momentum. The reason is that the new creation of companies in this industry is like bamboo shoots after the rain. Before and after each company's opening, there will be absorption and bottoming out. After the New Share stocks were strictly investigated by the Association, they were not allowed to be traded on the market, resulting in a limited number of Old Share stocks and a distribution that was not easy to fill. Although there were some sellers seeking cash, the market price remained stable. The new pharmaceutical industry was particularly outstanding, with Xinya rising another half yuan, and Zhongfa and Minyi also making progress. The department store and cultural stocks fell first and then returned to flat. The Greater China Match Company has risen too much recently and has fallen by 2.5 yuan. Zhabei Water and Electricity has fallen by another yuan. The Chinese stock and other stock prices were stable. Considering that everyone is still in the wait-and-see period, here is another separate list of the market prices of each stock:

### Spot Cotton Limited to Same-Day Delivery, Mill Cloth Transactions Slow, Prices Also Weakening

Due to the continued decline in spot cotton yesterday, the internal and external interest in mill cloth was weak. Sales of coarse and fine cloth were few and far between, and prices also weakened accordingly, falling by two to three yuan per bolt. Sixteen-pound Earth brand cloth was priced at 175 yuan, Flying Goose at 173 yuan, nine-pound New Universe at 107 yuan, eight-pound Zhenzhong at 105 yuan, twelve-pound Earth fine cloth at 160 yuan, Dapeng at 150 yuan, Fugui fine twill at 130 yuan, Magnolia bleached cloth at 160 yuan, Qin Liangyu at 150 yuan, Longevity House silk at 5 yuan 8 jiao, Volleyball at 3 yuan 8 jiao and a half, and Three Sheep serge at 5 yuan 8 jiao, all showing no gains or losses. Only Peach Blossom Women's Lin cloth experienced alternating rises and falls, but transactions remained busy. The morning opening price was 259 yuan, rising to 261 yuan, but the market later saw a large player selling, causing the price to drop to 255 yuan and 7 jiao and a half, a drop of 5 yuan. The spot market for Dongbu yesterday issued a notice to all members, only allowing same-day delivery for transactions, resulting in a slight decrease in transactions. Prices continued to decline, with new orders for twelve-pound Dragon Head fine cloth opening at 182 yuan and a half, falling to 177 yuan, and slightly rising to 178 yuan at noon, a decrease of 3 yuan and a half compared to last week. Bank orders were at 157 yuan and a half, Color Ball fine cloth at 162 yuan, Flying Fish at 160 yuan, Yanghe at 157 yuan, and Trumpet at 155 yuan.

At the noon close, those covering short positions pushed prices up again to 7 yuan 2 jiao 2 fen, also a decrease of 1 jiao 2 fen.

### Horsehair Interlining Uniquely Strong

The woolen market remained uneventful yesterday. Most operators have regained their composure. It is reported that the official price limits from the authorities may be announced tomorrow. Meanwhile, horsehair interlining showed a uniquely strong trend. Twelve-inch interlining was offered at 6 yuan 5 jiao per yard, nine-inch at 5 yuan, and six-inch at 4 yuan. The goods are exceptionally scarce, because the horsehair is shipped from Tianjin, and now it has been cut off. Production has ceased, and the black carbon interlining is also in short supply, so a supply interruption is expected.

### Gold Jewelry Exchange Rate Unchanged, Inter-dealer Prices Already Reduced

Yesterday, major gold shops in the city continued to quote the price for gold jewelry at 2,200 yuan per tael (deducting 350 yuan for purchases). Cash shops quoted the retail price at slightly under 50 yuan, totaling 2,150 yuan, and the purchase price at 1,950 yuan, a reduction of 300 yuan. The inter-dealer price started high in the morning at 30 yuan, at 1,950 yuan, but gradually declined amidst selling pressure, entering the 1,900 yuan level, and reaching 1,890 yuan at noon, a further reduction of 30 yuan compared to the previous day, with a difference of 60 yuan between high and low. Transactions were not heavy. Silver jewelry remained at 16 yuan, with the inter-dealer price around 11 yuan.

### Military Note Settlements Still Frequent

Yesterday, the foreign exchange market saw the inter-dealer price of Japanese military notes slightly rise to 5 yuan 5 jiao 6 fen 2 3 li, due to the continued settlement needs. Later, it was down to 5 yuan 5 jiao 5 fen 6 li, and finally to 5 yuan 5 jiao 5 fen 8 li. The retail price at banks and native banks retreated from 5 yuan 5 jiao 7 fen to 6 fen and a half, and the purchase price was 5 yuan 5 jiao 5 fen, it was said. Yesterday, the Shanghai Money Trade Association's overnight loan rate remained at 1 jiao 6 fen. New overdrafts and cash were trading at par, it was said.

### Stable Situation for Grains

Demand and supply for beans remained weak in bulk transactions. Broad beans arrivals decreased and tended to be more popular. Adzuki beans sales were good and trending up. Green beans were stable. Forty packages of Qingdao kidney beans were sold at 230 yuan. Fifty packages of Chongming sand broad beans were sold at 124 yuan. Another thirty packages of sand adzuki beans were sold at 163 yuan. More than twenty packages of Tianjin adzuki beans were sold at 163 yuan.

Soybean cakes were moving slowly and transactions were sparse. The market trend was stable. Two hundred pieces of February Wangu Stack soybean cake from Xianshengji were sold at 61 yuan.

The supply of dried sweet potatoes was seen as sparse, and retail sales were still active. The market trend was quite bullish. Yesterday, thirty packages of Jiangbei dried sweet potatoes opened at 110 yuan, self-delivery.

Bran demand turned sluggish, with some looseness among smallholders. The market trend was weakening. Yesterday, one hundred packages of Sanshin small-package bran for May Wangu Stack were offered at 100 yuan, a decrease of 3 yuan compared to the previous time.

### Sugar Shares Flat and Soft

Yesterday, sugar shares of the Sugar Merchants' Cooperative Business Office saw a flat and soft trend in the public meeting trading session. Turnover was also not high. Coarse sugar shares opened at 296 yuan and a half, down slightly by 2 yuan compared to last Friday. Red sugar shares were at 287 yuan without any change. Total turnover was 700 packages, and it is expected that there will be no excessive fluctuations during the day.

### The Tragedy of Coffee

— Yangzijiang

According to news from telegraphs, the Brazilian government's Ministry of Commerce ordered the destruction of 75,000 bags of coffee to prevent prices from falling. The occurrence of such events is already alarming news, but today, such farces in human society, which are no longer uncommon, have become diluted because people are used to seeing them.

I remember not long ago, a certain coffee shop in this city made a "touching" advertisement, roughly saying: "The stock of imported coffee in Shanghai is dwindling. Noble people who want to enjoy the taste should come as soon as possible." Brazil artificially destroys a large amount of coffee, but people can't help but feel sorry for it.

However, people who have undergone careful and deep imagination and observation will surely understand that similar tragedies are constantly being staged in our vicinity. Aren't high-end restaurants discarding the leftovers after diners are drunk and full every day? On the other hand, aren't there many people who can't even get things that are inferior to these leftovers, and are starving? And more…

If you don't think about it, it's fine, but once you think about it, you feel that there are too many similar examples! It's just that we don't feel it keenly because of familiarity or numbness in our daily lives.

### Casual Chat on Cooling Off

— Luolü

Winter is a season that keeps people sitting in their houses, at least at night, while summer is the opposite. Although the sky is slowly darkening, the house is still like a furnace, making it impossible to stay inside. Therefore, after dinner, "cooling off" has become an indispensable part of daily life in the summer.

Just like some people have a habit of running around with their rice bowls while eating, some people also like to run around while cooling off, and refuse to stay in their own courtyards or outside their gates. Some people even carry a stool from afar and rush to the International Hotel in Bubbling Well Road, because it is said that the wind is particularly strong there. So you go, and I go. After seven o'clock, the sidewalks at the top of Park Road—under the Fuli Company and the 24-story building—are already full of people. A gust of wind comes, and everyone's mouths open in joy, smiling.

Because of the decrease in cars on the road this year, the general public's position on cooling off has also developed outwards. The sidewalks are full, so they implement the invasion of the road, sitting on the road—even lying on the road. Anyway, this year there won't be any cars driven by wives and young ladies from the concession hitting you.

Great China Road and McBain Road are the quietest during the day, but at night, many people regard them as "good places to cool off," because there they can not only enjoy several cool evening breezes, but also enjoy some wonderful music for free—the concerts from the New Celestial Forest and the Metropolitan are carried to your ears by the wind. The passionate Hawaii music and the songs of Miss China will make you enjoy listening very much.

In advertisements in newspapers, you can often see places that are "summer resorts." But those places are not for anyone to enter and enjoy the kind of coolness that seems to be unique to these "summer resorts." At least, to go to those places, in addition to "cooling off," you also have to spend some CRB. Those places are nothing more than coffee shops, garden dance halls, etc. Gentlemanly old men and modern young ladies are the ones who often go to those places to "cool off." Accompanying your lover to the rooftop garden of the G.G. Coffee Shop, or to the garden dance halls of Paramount, New Celestial Forest, and Lido. The "Summer Garden" on Jing'an Temple Road seems to be cooler, although it is purely a "garden" without a band, but relying on the transmission of the "microphone," you can sit outside and hear the Jazz music coming from the dance hall inside. If you feel "too cool" while sitting in those "summer resorts," then you can hire a companion girl to sit with you, perhaps her "enthusiasm" will prevent you from catching a cold "because it's too cool."

Although it is the same "cooling off," the difference in enjoyment between the rich and the poor cannot be measured in reason.

Constantly revealing the pain of thirst for life, the heavy pressure of life makes them immerse themselves in sweat and fatigue all day long, struggling with their weak bodies, raising their weak hands, and fighting the country of life. Their sweat, blood, and tears constitute the crystallization of an inch of cloth.

Summer will not stay in the factory forever; it will go and come back, and come back and go again, but what about human youth? This group of strugglers for survival let it be permanently buried in narrowness for the sake of life, and the idea of a vast life will never emerge again.

### Summer in the Factory

— Ling Zuren

The friction heat of heavy machinery, the heat dissipation of the human body, the evaporation heat of the sun, heat, heat, heat everywhere!

The yarn blooms, the looms weave, interweaving into a roaring sound of primitive movement, bathing in the sweat and oil all day long, fully expressing the struggle for survival.

Summer puts a fiery coat on the earth, and it also stirs up an unusual floating heat in the factory. The friction heat of heavy machinery, the heat dissipation of the human body, and the scorching heat of the fierce sun decorate the factory with heat everywhere! The summer monsoon is also so stingy with its identity, and is not easily willing to visit, so the heat wave is even higher, and the mercury column of the thermometer is also rising wildly at eighty, ninety, almost reaching the boiling point.

There is no summer in the factory. Twelve hours of work a day, without relaxation. In the hot air, the noise of yarn blooms and looms still spreads, interweaving into a "rumble! rumble! bang! bang!" roaring sound of primitive movement, which is sluggish, heavy, and shocks people's senses, making people tired and bored.

Lurking in this sound, breathing also often brings the smell of sweat mixed with various oils to the nostrils. Grains and fine wool leap in the sunlight. The air is so turbid and suffocating.

But in order to conquer life, we have to bathe in this atmosphere all day long. On the lean and yellow faces of the familiar workers, the accumulated sweat shines with a glittering light. In those pairs of weak eyes that lack sleep,

### In the Same Boat Through Storms

— He Jia

(8) What Can Be Done

Second Madam Ye propped herself up in bed, hugging the lower half of her body with a blanket, and said, "Weicheng, sit down and talk." Weicheng sat on the edge of Second Madam Ye's bed, leaning sideways. Second Madam Ye said, "What you want to say to me now is something you don't want others to hear. You can close the door." Weicheng closed the door and sat back on the edge of the bed, scratching his temples and saying, "Aunt, I've made a trip for nothing." Second Madam Ye said, "What do you mean?" Weicheng shook his head, "It's hard to say in a word... Didn't my mother's will say that I could only take revenge after I had a son? This is really a difficult problem. After thinking about it, the most important thing to solve right now is the marriage problem. I'm afraid my aunt, as an outsider, sees things clearly and knows my thoughts. Recently, I have a very good impression of Guofang. I think we get along well, first of all. Secondly, Guofang understands everything about me. She told Sister Cuizhen last time that she already had a mother-in-law's family, but she was just joking. I'm really not afraid of what people say. When I think about doing this, I decide to do it, and I feel that the sooner I do it, the sooner Chuping will be at ease." Second Madam Ye nodded, "As for revenge, there's no need to mention it now. You have to think that your mother wrote this will, and she wouldn't give it to me or to you. Perhaps when she was dying, she had already changed her mind and didn't necessarily want you to take revenge. It's a great thing and the right thing to do that you can think about solving the marriage problem first. You didn't meet their siblings in Shuangqiao, but you did in Shanghai. What was the result?" Weicheng said, "I met their grandmother in Shuangqiao. I gathered my courage and asked her, 'Grand Aunt, I want to ask something I shouldn't ask. If Guofang becomes the daughter-in-law of the Ye family, does Grand Aunt think it's a good match?' Aunt, can you guess how this grandmother answered me? She said it frankly. She smiled and said, 'It's not only a good match, but it's also a perfect match. Good, good.' Aunt, that's why I took Axing and ran to Shanghai." (157)

### Reading Methods

— Luo Chen

Written for Scholarship Application Review

Due to a friend's relationship, I was able to see the screening test papers of students applying for scholarships. From this, I was inspired to write my opinions on the reading methods of general students today.

The questions are very practical. They test the students' degree of diligence in reading usually, and more importantly, they also test the students' degree of "digestion" of books, and whether they pay attention to daily life.

Most students have achieved the former (diligence in reading); while the latter, it is easier to be overlooked than the former.

Those test papers illustrate this point. Many students are still reading with old methods. They have not digested what they read. They have indeed spent a lot of effort on books, but they are wrong—they don't pay attention to life at all!

For example, most students can answer things that need to be memorized. There was an English question in the junior high school group, which was to write out the past tense and past participle of the verb. The errors in the test papers accounted for only about 10%, but it is obvious that this is the result of their usual rote memorization. Some people remember the sound very accurately, but misspell the letters.

Conversely, there are many errors in the common sense questions. One student wrote: The person who invented the theory of evolution was Xu Guangqi. Another said that the inventor of the theory of evolution was Sun Yat-sen, and the theory of relativity was invented by Roosevelt. Another wrote that the household rice quota for the third period was one liter of rice, half a liter of broken rice, and forty catties of flour—what a rich food supply!

For such things, general school teachers should bear a large part of the responsibility. Because teachers only want to test whether students have read books, they often use some so-called "niche" questions to stump students, so that students delve into the horns of a bull, but ignore the useful common sense related to daily life. Many students also do not know the freezing point and boiling point of thermometers (in fact, this is in junior high school physics, and even in elementary school science). I believe that if you ask general students: It was 102 degrees the hottest day before the last two days, why didn't the water boil? Isn't the boiling point of water 100 degrees? — There will definitely be many people who cannot answer.

Many people (including parents and students themselves) have a wrong concept, that is, they only care about upgrading every semester, and don't care whether it is digested or "absorbed." As a result, they only pay attention to exams and scores. During exams, they work hard, burn the midnight oil, memorize by force, and do not pay attention to real life at all.

A certain educator once said: Life is education, and society is a university. This is really a profound truth. We live in the 20th century today, and we are no longer in the era of the imperial examination. We must understand life from books and understand the world. This is the correct way to read.

Paying attention to life with books is inappropriate now!
