### Fierce Fighting Continues on the Kharkov Front; Germany Claims the Battle in the Area is Over, Some Say Soviet Forces are Advancing on Kharkov

Berlin, 30th (Havas) - The full text of the Führer's Headquarters communiqué states: "The great battle of Kharkov is over. In the area under the command of General Bock, Commander-in-Chief of the Southern Army Group of the German Army, the troops under Generals Zierst and Paulus launched a counter-offensive and achieved a great victory of annihilation. The Romanian army led by General Tragrina, as well as the Italian and Slovak troops, fought side by side with the German army and achieved a great victory. Our air force effectively assisted the army in both offense and defense, gaining air supremacy. The Red Army's 6th, 9th, and 57th Army Corps were annihilated, and 20 infantry divisions, 7 cavalry divisions, and 14 tank brigades of the enemy were completely wiped out. We captured 240,000 prisoners, seized and destroyed 1,249 tanks, 2,026 field guns, 538 aircraft, and countless military supplies."

London, 30th (Reuters) - Elite units of the Soviet Southern Army Group, covered by tank formations, have reportedly broken through the German defenses four miles in front of Kharkov city. The vanguard has reached the village of Donilovka, seven miles northeast of the city. Red Army artillery has begun shelling the city, the first time since March. As for the Izyum-Babenkovo line, 75 miles south of the city, fierce fighting continues, the intensity of which is unprecedented in the Kharkov battle.

Berlin, 30th (Haitong News Agency) - A German military spokesman today commented on the German High Command's final report on the Battle of Kharkov, stating that in addition to the loss of 240,000 prisoners, the Soviet forces also suffered at least the same number of casualties, so the total number of soldiers lost was approximately 500,000. The battle was initiated by the Soviet army crossing the Donets River, probing the weak German defensive line. Between Kharkov South, Belyi Kolodez, and Balakleya, the German line remained strong. However, between Balakleya and Izyum, the Soviet army was able to cross the Donets River and advance in a wedge-shaped formation directly towards Krasnograd, 92 miles southwest of Kharkov. Their intention was to advance north from Krasnograd and attack the rear of Kharkov from the side. The German side dispatched two army groups, advancing towards the northeast and southeast of Kharkov respectively, in order to intercept the flank of the Soviet army that had crossed the Donets River. At the same time, the German armored forces led by General Kleist advanced rapidly northward from Aleksandrovka, 15 miles south of Babenkovo. The Soviet army, which had broken through the defensive line between Balakleya and Izyum and reached the Aleksandrovka-Lozovaya line in the west, then changed its direction of march and advanced eastward. The aforementioned Aleksandrovka-Lozovaya line is approximately 42 miles long, extending from north to south to Krasnograd. Although the vanguard of the Soviet army had advanced to a certain point east of Krasnograd, it was unable to continue its advance. After the Soviet army northeast of Kharkov was driven back to the Donets River by a German counter-offensive, the Soviet army east of Krasnograd was also forced to retreat at the same time. The German armored divisions under General Kleist then rapidly advanced to Balakleya, where they joined forces with the troops of General Paulus. Thus, the encirclement of the Soviet army south of Kharkov and east of Krasnograd was completed, and the Soviet retreat route was completely cut off. The area of this battlefield is approximately 3,500 square kilometers, exceeding the Kerch Peninsula by approximately 1,000 square kilometers. Kharkov city itself was not affected by the fighting in the slightest. The two major battles of Kharkov and Kerch are closely related. The intention of Soviet General Timoshenko was to conquer the Kerch Peninsula and the city of Kharkov. If he could occupy Kerch, the reconquest of the entire Crimea would not be a problem. Then, he could further advance from Crimea and Kharkov simultaneously, directly reaching the heartland of Ukraine. From the German perspective, both Kharkov and Kerch were starting points for an offensive towards the Caucasus. The importance of these two locations is evident. After these two major annihilation battles, Timoshenko will not be able to launch offensive operations, at least in the near future.

Eastern Newspaper's Observation of the Eastern Front Situation

Tokyo, 30th (Domei) - According to a dispatch from Berlin and Kutuzov in the Jiji Shinpo, the major offensive on the European front has not yet begun, and the Kerch and Kharkov battles were defensive actions by the German army against the Soviet offensive.

German Forces Concentrate in Bryansk

Somewhere on the Soviet border, 29th (Havas World News Agency) - The great battle in the Kharkov area continues in a very chaotic state. Positions are gained and lost constantly, and both sides are unwilling to release accurate information on the location of their positions. At the same time, military observers are shifting their attention to other areas, believing that major battles will soon occur in the Bryansk and Sevastopol areas. Soviet reconnaissance planes have discovered that the German side is concentrating a large number of troops in the Bryansk area, and German planes are also actively operating in the skies over the city, indicating an imminent large-scale offensive. German planes are also very active on the Sevastopol line, and the German side is also concentrating a large number of infantry there. It seems that the Red Army headquarters wants to force the German army to decentralize its forces, changing its announced spring offensive into a local offensive, in order to maintain its current positions and indefinitely postpone the German plan for a large-scale offensive towards the Caucasus. Currently, fierce fighting continues in the Izyum and Babenkovo areas southeast of Kharkov. The Soviet side insists that multiple Red Army units have broken through the German encirclement. German stormtroopers have crossed the Donets River, but retreated after hand-to-hand combat. However, reports from Rostov indicate that the situation is favorable to the German army. Fierce fighting is reportedly taking place near the Koziarevka area. The Red Army still holds one bridge across the Donets River. Five divisions of the Red Army have withdrawn from the encircled area, but 70,000 Red Army soldiers are still trapped within the encirclement. German light troops broke through the Red Army lines last night and reached a location five miles from Koziarevka, thereby threatening the retreating Red Army.

Major Battle Brewing in the Kalinin Area

London, 30th (Reuters) - Reports from Moscow state that the major battle in the Izyum area southeast of Kharkov is still ongoing. According to Reuters dispatches from Moscow, large German forces on the Izyum front launched counter-offensives in various locations yesterday, attempting to cross the river unsuccessfully. The fate of the Kharkov and Izyum battles hinges on this. The German counter-offensives have made little progress. Large-scale fighting is taking place in the Izyum and Babenkovo areas, with approximately 500,000 soldiers fighting each other in the area. Yesterday's news initially reported that German forces in one area of Izyum had been forced to adopt a defensive posture, which is quite noteworthy. The momentum of the German forces in the Kharkov area has also diminished, not as fierce as the counter-offensives of several days ago. The Soviet commander on the Kharkov front is now quite confident. Fighting also occurs daily on the Northwestern Front and the Kalinin Front. Soviet forces on the Northwestern Front are constantly attacking German forces. Some observers believe that the German army may launch a large-scale offensive through the Kalinin area. Although there are no detailed reports of the fighting within Soviet territory, London sources believe that the fighting around Izyum has temporarily stabilized. Today's Soviet noon communiqué stated that on the night of May 29th, Soviet forces engaged in defensive battles against German infantry and tanks in the Izyum and Babenkovo areas. No major events occurred in other areas of the front.

Berlin, 30th (Haitong News Agency) - German military figures stated that German air units went to the Donets area the day before yesterday, bombing the remaining Soviet troops in the encirclement. Vehicles, tanks, and barracks within the area were also targeted by our planes. The enemy's rear transportation lines in the central sector of the Eastern Front were also bombed by German planes. Dive bombers destroyed multiple enemy trains. Six enemy planes were shot down during aerial combat. The port facilities of Sevastopol were bombed again the day before yesterday, suffering heavy damage. Our planes attacked enemy naval bases in the Black Sea area, and one destroyer was hit and destroyed. The enemy supply center at Lake Ladoga was also bombed, and one cargo ship was hit and caught fire. The enemy's offensive northeast of Lake Ilmen failed.

### Tank Battles Unfold on the Libyan Front; German Planes Attack the West Coast of Egypt

Stockholm, 30th (Haitong News Agency) - According to news received here from London, the intensity of the tank battle taking place between Bir Hakeim and El Adem, 30 kilometers south of Tobruk, is increasing. London believes that this battle will determine the future direction of the German-Italian offensive. Neither side has the advantage of terrain, so the outcome of the battle depends entirely on which side has better tanks and better troops.

Stockholm, 30th (Haitong News Agency) - According to news received in London yesterday afternoon, a tank battle is currently taking place in Libya. Because the situation is constantly changing, the location of the positions is not yet clear. It will likely take some time before the offensive and defensive situation can be accurately determined. According to British reports, the tank battle is taking place between Knightsbridge and Sidi Rezegh. The British air force is actively assisting in the battle. The German side has two tank divisions participating. The direction of the German attack is aimed at El Adem. London believes that the German attack is the second phase, and will launch simultaneous attacks on Tobruk in three directions. A decisive battle is expected to occur soon. As for the German attack on El Gazala, its purpose is only to divert the attention of the British Eighth Army.

Berlin, 30th (Haitong News Agency) - Military circles here believe that the recent North African battles that have occurred since the joint German-Italian offensive are "General Rommel employing another tactic against the enemy, much like a boxing technique. A good boxer should first assess the opponent's strength." Military circles are unwilling to make any comments on the scope of General Rommel's actions, only stating that "the current battles in North Africa will reach their peak within days." Currently, tank battles are taking place in a vast area, encompassing important strongholds on both sides. Berlin now acknowledges that the actions of the German air force units under the command of Field Marshal Kesselring have two major goals: to eliminate Malta, the base that hinders the Axis powers' supply and reinforcement routes to North Africa, and to eliminate the island as a base for protecting British east-west transport lines.

Berlin, 30th (Haitong News Agency) - The German High Command stated yesterday that German planes successfully attacked the Egyptian west coast airfield of Fuka on Thursday. According to the communiqué, the visibility was very clear at the time. Several heavy bombs fell into the repair shops, so it is certain that several planes were destroyed by shrapnel. German planes also bombed the port of Tobruk the night before last, and the port facilities suffered heavy damage. Seven British planes were shot down by German fighters over Marmarika. The enemy planes were all "Hurricane" and "Kittyhawk" types. German planes also concentrated their attacks on British vehicle convoys on the coastal road east of Tobruk, inflicting heavy casualties on the British side.

In order to protect this important base from being occupied by Japanese forces, we will send troops to reinforce them if necessary. In short, the Union of South Africa relies solely on its own efforts for its national defense and does not want others to interfere.

### General Marshall Predicts Alliance with Britain to Invade Europe; Reports of Negotiations Between Britain, America, and the Soviet Union, Possible Alliance

West Point, USA, 29th (Havas) - US Army Chief of Staff General Marshall gave a speech today to graduates of the military academy here, predicting that US troops will invade the European continent. He said, "US troops have landed in Britain and will land in France in the future. All of you are young officers and must work hard to improve yourselves, promote morale, and strengthen your physique so that you can catch up with your predecessors." Political figures here generally believe that General Marshall's words are the first official statement announcing the government's decision to open a second front in Europe. Although General Marshall did not mention when preparations for this will begin, British and American public opinion, especially the Soviet Union, will surely be satisfied.

Washington, 29th (Havas) - General Marshall's speech today, in which he stated that US troops are about to invade the European continent, has been given great importance by the newspapers here, which have used large headlines to report it. However, according to informed sources, General Marshall's words are not surprising. Military leaders from Britain and America have been preparing for an expedition to Europe for more than a day, and France has been chosen as the first country to invade.

### Brazilian Navy and Air Force Cooperate in Coastal Patrols; Authorized to Attack Submarines on Sight; Reports of Italian Submarine Sinking American Warship Proven False

Buenos Aires, 29th (Domei) - According to reports from Rio de Janeiro, the Brazilian Ministry of Aeronautics announced on the 29th that in order to protect Brazilian merchant ships on Brazilian territorial waters, the country's air force will begin operations. In fact, the Brazilian government has entered a state of war with the Axis powers. It is reported that the Brazilian navy is also cooperating with the air force to patrol the coast. At the same time, in view of the repeated sinkings of Allied ships off the Atlantic coast, the Brazilian government decided on the 29th that future transport ships heading to the United States will be escorted by Brazilian warships.

New York, 29th (Associated Press) - According to the Associated Press from Rio de Janeiro, Brazilian air force personnel have been ordered to collaborate in attacking Axis submarines in the western Atlantic, similar to the "shoot on sight" policy ordered by the American authorities last year. Brazil participated in the First World War because of the sinking of ships, and was the only South American country to join the Allies at that time. Also, the Italian claim that an Italian submarine sank an American battleship has been proven false. According to personnel from an Argentine steamship returning from overseas, no American warship was seen at the location where the Italian side claimed to have sunk the American warship.

Washington, 29th (Havas) - Secretary of State Hull made a statement to the press, saying that he fully agrees with Brazil's decision to allow its air force to attack Axis submarines off its coast. The governments of the United States and Colombia have signed a new agreement extending the term of the American military mission stationed in that country for four years. When a reporter asked about Chilean Foreign Minister Barros's upcoming visit to Washington, the Secretary of State said that he had not heard of this. If Foreign Minister Barros were to visit Washington, he would be very welcome.

### Loan Period Shortened; Interest Rate Increased

The standard loan period for pawned goods in this city was originally twelve months, with an interest rate of three cents per yuan. According to a report from a Datong News Agency reporter yesterday, the industry, in view of the fluctuating exchange rates, has found that the value of the loans provided is effectively lower than the value at the time of redemption, resulting in a large hidden loss that cannot be compensated by the interest earned. However, the pawn industry inherently has the nature of assisting ordinary people in urgent need, so it continues to maintain operations. It is learned that the industry decided yesterday that, starting from June 1, the loan period for pawned goods will be changed to eight months, and the interest rate will be increased to five cents per yuan. As for the pledging industry, it has also been decided that, starting from June 1, the loan period will be changed to four months, and the interest rate will be increased to five cents, plus a storage fee of one cent, totaling six cents.

### American Diplomatic Personnel to Withdraw Mid-Next Month; British Officials in China Delay Departure; American Civilians Have Not Yet Received Notice

The Shanghai Times reports that the Swiss Vice-Consul in Shanghai, Mr. Hsilin, told reporters yesterday (the 29th) that American officials will withdraw from Shanghai between June 10th and 15th. This information was obtained from the Japanese authorities handling the withdrawal procedures. The majority of the Americans who will withdraw are American diplomatic and consular officials, as well as diplomatic and consular officials from Canada and South American countries at war with Japan.

Ships

If there is sufficient space, American civilians in Shanghai will also be repatriated. As for British diplomatic and consular officials and civilians, as well as other officials gathered in Shanghai for repatriation, they must wait another month or so, as their repatriation ship has been delayed. American officials who are about to withdraw have received notice to prepare for departure and have begun packing. However, American civilians have not yet received this notice, as it is not yet known which Americans will be allowed to be repatriated first. The final list of the first group of repatriated Americans may be published one week before departure. When asked about the

Number

of Americans about to leave Shanghai, Hsilin replied that this matter is not handled by the Swiss Consulate, so he is not aware. When the American repatriation ship departs from Shanghai, other repatriation ships will also depart from other ports and gather at a certain place at sea, sailing to Lourenco Marques to bring back Japanese diplomatic and consular officials and civilians for exchange. These ships will not come to Shanghai on their return trip, but will sail directly to Japan.

### Current Situation of Disaster Relief and Education Center Amid Extreme Economic Difficulties

The Shanghai Disaster Relief and Education Center was established in mid-April of the 27th year of the Republic (1938). It houses disaster-stricken children who have been displaced and uprooted. To date, the number of children has surged to 250. Through the arduous efforts of Director Ms. Li Qiujun, the center has managed to survive despite the soaring prices of everything and the difficulty of procuring food, preventing the more than 200 disaster-stricken children from becoming starving corpses. To understand the center's operations, our reporter visited and presents a brief account of the situation below:

Imposing New Building

The Shanghai Disaster Relief and Education Center was initially located near the Jinsitu Temple on Kang Nao Tuo Road (Connaught Road). It could accommodate about 120 disaster-stricken children, all of whom were orphans or lost children after the war, with disheveled hair, dirty faces, and inadequate clothing. As the number of children increased daily, the original site became insufficient. Therefore, a site was rented on the open space at No. 285 Ju'er Dian Road (Route Courbet) in the French Concession for a period of 20 years. Funds were raised from all sectors of society, totaling 50,000 yuan, and a magnificent new building was finally completed. To date, it accommodates 250 disaster-stricken children.

Overview of Arrangements

The center is surrounded by bamboo fences. The two rooms inside the main gate are divided into a rattan workshop and a sewing class. The remaining space is for teachers' dormitories, etc. The central open space is surrounded by low evergreen trees, with basketball hoops in the center and slides and rollers in the left corner for the children to play during their spare time. There are also two roads and two gates, such as Sanxing Road, Pan Shanglin Road, Xinguang Gate, and Jincheng Gate, which were all donated with large sums of money to mark the occasion. The auditorium in the back, named Huaici Hall, is a two-story building, built in Western style with Chinese features, resembling an ancient temple. Both sides are divided into classrooms for various grades, as well as teachers' offices and bathrooms. The upper floors are divided into male and female dormitories, named Zulai Room, Feibin Room, Fengming Room, Lanquan Hall, and Yun Song Hall. There are also several storage rooms and medical rooms. The male and female dormitories each occupy several rooms. Each room in the female dormitory has nine short iron beds, each accommodating two people. The male dormitory has three-tiered wooden bunk beds, also with two people sharing each bed. The cotton bedding is clean. Next to the beds are wooden lattice boxes for the children to store their washbasins and toiletries. Everyone is numbered, and the order is well-maintained.

Production Achievements

According to Ms. Hua Yaruo, the director of the center, the educational facilities follow the current elementary school curriculum standards. During their spare time, production education is added, such as rattan work, bamboo work, and sewing classes. Technicians are hired to teach rattan and bamboo work, and the products include rattan baskets, rattan mats, rattan chairs, and children's toys, bamboo pen holders, pen racks, tables, stools, chairs, and mats. The sewing class has ten iron sewing machines, producing exquisite children's shirts, pants, shawls, and hats. The products are well received and ordered by all sectors, but the limited production is a regret.

Current Financial Situation

As for finances, it is a serious problem. The center relies entirely on enthusiastic donations from all sectors. Previously, the Refugee Relief Association and Renji Hall and other charitable organizations provided some subsidies. Now that the association has been dissolved and prices have soared, the monthly expenditure is 20,000 yuan. The current situation is precarious. It is hoped that wealthy people in Shanghai will step forward and donate as much as possible to prevent the more than 200 disaster-stricken children from being displaced and losing their homes again.

Source of Clothing

In terms of clothing, the students wear long robes in winter and work clothes in the other three seasons, all produced by the sewing class. The raw materials are either donated or purchased at special prices. However, the price of cloth has soared dozens of times, and there is currently no solution. It is hoped that ladies from all walks of life will collect old clothes, pants, shoes, hats, socks, cloth, and fabrics and donate them to the center so that all the disaster-stricken children will not suffer from the cold. This is especially desired.

Simple Food

The food consists of two congees and one meal, mixed with corn and American wheat, supplemented with vegetables, and each person is given a small bowl. There is no fish or meat throughout the year, and they are now extremely expensive. If this continues, there may never be a day for meat. When eating, everyone is assigned a seat at a table in the classroom, and the food is distributed in an orderly manner. Bathing and haircuts are regulated.

### Household Economy Should Start with the Housewife

— Yi

Browsing through books on household management, there is this motto: "The purse strings of the household are in the hands of the housewife." Because the housewife plans all the household expenses, if her hand is a little loose or she neglects planning, it can invisibly increase household expenses.

Moreover, husbands generally do not have the time or authority to interfere in the administration of housewives. Therefore, at a time when the family urgently needs to economize, housewives should take on their responsibilities.

From today onwards, housewives should no longer entrust the task of buying vegetables to servants, but can take on the task of buying vegetables themselves, which can not only save on food expenses but also buy fresher vegetables. The coal stove can no longer be allowed to burn all day and night, but should be sealed overnight (sealing the coal stove at night is not a good way, not only is it more expensive for coal briquettes, but the kettle used on top is also easily damaged because the heat is concentrated on one point). Careful attention should also be paid to the consumption of soap. Get up early and go to bed early every day, shorten the time between lunch and dinner, and reduce the cost of snacks. All of these are within the power of the housewife.

Thrift is originally a virtue. Mrs. Washington, a skilled housekeeper, dressed very frugally and can be considered a model wife. Her husband's and her own clothes were mostly sewn by her own hands. Even the formal dress he wore when he took office as president was sewn by her own hands. Housewives who hear this story will definitely have a strong interest in household economy work.

### Family Maxims

To have a constant heart without constant property. Happiness in cotton clothes. Knowing only righteousness and not knowing profit. Peace even in a thatched cottage.

Contentment brings peace to all things. Greed brings danger to all things. Contentment brings life to all things. Greed brings death to all things.

Do not borrow money to build a house. Borrowing money to build a house. It will inevitably lead to selling the house to repay the loan. Do not borrow money to buy land. Borrowing money to buy land. It will inevitably lead to selling the land to repay the debt.

If the household is diligent and thrifty, the world cannot make me poor. If the character is noble and pure, the world cannot despise me. If the heart is indifferent, the world cannot make me sick. If the conduct is strict and cautious, the world cannot bring disaster upon me.

If the family is harmonious, the family will surely be in order. If the family is in order, the descendants will prosper. If one is harmonious with others, others will surely be pleased. If others are pleased, they will be dedicated to helping.

Announcement of Essay Competition Results

### The Diet Problem Amid Soaring Prices

— Li Ang

Recent prices have risen unexpectedly high, and it is simply impossible for us housewives to calculate. We can only prepare a certain amount of money each month and use it within this amount. There may be small fluctuations every day, but we can make adjustments at the end of the month. We must save money and also consider nutrition. Chicken, duck, fish, and pork are good for nutrition, but green vegetables and tofu are also nutritious. We must eat everything, and the amount we eat must be moderate. The distribution of vegetables must be balanced. We do not have to be rigid about eating meat or vegetables, as long as the cooking is done properly, it will be a good meal. A bowl of tofu is often more delicious than a bowl of meat or fish. Some people say that there are dozens of dishes, but there is nowhere to put the chopsticks, which is the reason why they are not good at cooking. The waste and savings of ingredients for the same dish are also very different. Moreover, a dish with many ingredients is not necessarily delicious, and a dish with few ingredients is sometimes more delicious. For example, if you braise two yellow croakers, weighing one catty and three ounces, you need two ounces of raw oil, half an ounce of cooking wine, two and a half ounces of soy sauce, and one tablespoon each of sugar and salt. If you simmer it in clear soup, you only need one ounce each of raw oil and cooking wine, half an ounce of soy sauce, and half a tablespoon each of sugar and salt. The ingredients can be saved by half, and the taste is more delicious. Because the simmered fish is fresh and tender, and the umami is hidden in the meat; the braised fish is old and loose, and most of the umami is leaked into the soup. The same is true for pork. Simmered pork is always clearer and more tender than braised pork, and the ingredients can be saved by more than half. Vegetarian dishes such as soy sprouts, tofu, and eggplant are all more delicious simmered than braised. If you eat several simmered dishes at the same time, you can use a bowl rack to simmer several dishes in one pot, saving a lot on ingredients, heat, and time. During this period of fuel shortage, this method may be used more often. Pork costs eight or nine yuan a catty, which is shocking. But if it is distributed properly, one catty of meat can be divided into three or four light, delicious dishes. We can cut seven ounces of lean meat, five ounces into small slices, and stir-fry with asparagus and new broad beans, which are emerald green and milky white, with excellent color and taste. Cut the remaining two ounces into shredded meat and make soup with snow vegetables, which is clear and elegant. Cut five ounces of the nine ounces of fatter meat into dices and stir-fry with bamboo shoots, fragrant dried tofu, and soy sauce. The remaining four ounces can be minced into meat paste and stewed with a little salted fish. These two dishes are very rich, fragrant, and delicious, and are the best dishes to eat with rice. When we cook, we must pay attention to the taste, but also to the color and aroma. If a dish is pleasing in color and fragrant in aroma, then even if the dish itself is ordinary, it will not affect the appetite. For example, when eating lettuce, you can use its leaves to make rice or congee, and at the same time use the aroma of lettuce to stimulate the appetite, which can save some vegetables. Noodles cost two yuan, five or six jiao a catty, and everyone complains that they are expensive. But if you cook them with some white rice, shrimp, or diced meat and a large amount of spinach into a mushy noodle dish, then dinner for a family of four or five will be more than enough. Corn, commonly known as six grains, is placed outside the five grains, and its low value can be seen. But if you cook corn flour with sweet potatoes into a congee, it will be sweet, fragrant, delicious, and have a unique flavor. Also, if you cook the broken corn until it is soft and then make rice with the rice, it will be loose and glutinous. In short, when we cook, we must plan comprehensively from all aspects, make more changes, and try our best to make corn and other things that we are not used to eating more edible. We want to give the whole family a strong appetite, get full nutrition, and achieve the goal of economic savings invisibly.

### The Problem of Concubines

— Qiu Lang

Originally, it is a matter of course that one man and one woman form a family.

But in society, there seem to be few families that follow this model. Marital discord and disharmony are common. Examining the causes of discord, although there are various incidents, economic panic, worrying about firewood and rice all day long, and the difficulty of life are the main reasons, which is truly pitiful and lamentable! On the contrary, in families that are wealthy, have stable lives, and enjoy abundant material enjoyment, and yet still have conflicts in the home, with both sides developing animosity, most of these are probably caused by taking concubines.

Moving on to new things is a constant human feeling.

On the man's side, he uses the excuse, "The people of Qi have one wife and one concubine," to comfort himself, or even goes further to seek three wives and four concubines, which is not uncommon. He feels that this is not enough to show off his luxury and display his extravagance. On the wife's side, "The husband is the one on whom she relies for life." Seeing her husband take another wife, she treats herself as a stranger. When emotions break down, resentment and scolding are inevitable.

There are even those who "have three unfilial acts, and the greatest is the lack of offspring," and therefore take a concubine to seek an heir. On the surface, this seems to be a legitimate act and cannot be lumped together with those who flaunt luxury and show off extravagance. However, conflicts between the wives and concubines in the family are still inevitable and ultimately hinder happiness. So, is it permissible for a man to take a concubine? Should the status of concubine exist? These questions should be addressed to the readers of this publication.

### Do Not Ignore What We See

— Li

We live in this world and can see many things, but we must not ignore what we see. Many successful scientists are very careful observers. For example, Newton was sitting in the garden one day and saw an apple fall from the tree to the ground. He then studied the principle of gravity. Watt saw boiling water in a pot and successfully studied the steam engine.

Another astronomer, Galileo, went to the church and saw a hanging lamp swinging left and right. He found it very strange, so he tied a penny to a string and swung it in the same way, which made him interested in science.

His parents originally wanted him to be a doctor, so they did not want him to study mathematics. He was a very intelligent child who could draw very good pictures. Because he felt that he had to understand geometry to draw pictures, he began to study it.

At that time, there was a scientist named Archimedes who could calculate the weight of the metal in the emperor's crown. However, Galileo thought he could use a simpler method, so he invented the balance and wrote a paper on it. People in society admired him and invited him to teach mathematics at the University of Pisa. From then on, he devoted his life to scientific research and made great contributions to mankind.

Therefore, no matter what we see, we must study it carefully, which can lead us to amazing discoveries.

### One Week Family Menu

— Ms. Hua Ying

Yesterday, I received a letter forwarded by the editor from reader Mr. Sun Pinde, asking how to keep stir-fried broad beans green and not yellow. Generally speaking, whether cooked broad beans are green or not depends entirely on whether the beans are fresh. If they are beans picked the day before, no matter how skilled you are at cooking them, they will always be yellow. If they are fresh broad beans picked that day, they will naturally be green after cooking. If you add a little alkali to them, they will be even softer and more delicious. However, broad beans are already old now, so you can only shell them and stir-fry them with scallions. Mr. Sun also asked how to make steamed buns. There are two ways to make steamed buns. One way is to use the yeast starter from a steamed bun shop. This method is not easy for beginners to achieve satisfactory results, because if you add too much alkali, the buns will turn yellow, and if you add too little, the buns will taste sour. Only those with rich experience can make them soft and white. First, buy a yeast starter from a steamed bun shop, divide it into small pieces, put it in flour, and knead it with warm water. The more you knead, the better. Place it in a container, cover it with a damp cloth, and place it in a warm place to let it ferment for about a week (the fermentation time depends on the weather temperature). The flour will look like a honeycomb. At this time, dissolve the alkali in a small amount of warm water, pour it into the wet dough, and knead it again. Wait a little while, add the filling, and make buns. After making them, wait a while, then put them in a pot of boiling water to steam until cooked. The fire must be strong. In about half an hour, you can enjoy them.

### A Lost Lamb, Give it a Way Out

— Wen

Zhuge Liang's Eight Trigrams Formation and Emperor Yang of Sui's Labyrinth, although their intentions and purposes are completely different, in terms of technique, they are equally tortuous and exquisite, captivating. The picture above is certainly not comparable to any formation or palace, but once a gentle lamb is lost in it, finding a way out is not an easy task. This is like young people who should follow the guidance of relatives, friends, and teachers, and follow the right path to move forward in order to achieve the goal of success. Otherwise, going astray will have unthinkable consequences. Children, look at this lamb, hesitating and wandering, how pitiful. Please use a pencil to draw a correct path on this seemingly simple picture, which is actually dizzying enough, to guide it out!

### Where Should a Child Born Out of Wedlock Go?

— Chen

I am a child born out of wedlock. Because my mother came from a feudal family, she was expelled by my maternal grandfather after she fell in love with a man who had lost his parents at a young age. Later, my father died of a stroke, and when I had just graduated from elementary school, death cruelly took my mother away.

An orphan without parents, I was sent to my maternal grandfather's house by relatives and friends. It has been two years now. My maternal grandfather relies on his family property to live a leisurely life and is always unhappy with me. My maternal grandmother, who is more than ten years younger than him, and her daughter often use small things to ridicule and insult me.

Last fall, someone pursued me enthusiastically, but maybe he found out that I was a child born out of wedlock and became distant from me. I want to be independent, but I think society will also abandon me. This poor orphan who has only graduated from junior high school, I want to jump out of my maternal grandfather's house, I really can't stand their attitude. Where should a child born out of wedlock go? It has been lingering in my mind.

Chen: We sympathize with your situation very much. The pain you are feeling now is not difficult to imagine. However, you must know that you are innocent, because there are only bad parents in the world, and there are absolutely no children who come with sin. In feudal society, a child born out of wedlock is a great shame, but as long as you have an independent personality, no one will pay attention to your background. (And you were born after ten months of pregnancy like everyone else, so what's the difference between you and others?)

In your current environment, the only way is to resist. This resistance is not against your maternal grandfather, but against the old ethics. But resistance must be prepared, and preparation can only be done through self-cultivation. If you are interested in a certain field of study, we are very willing to help you succeed. With a junior high school education, it is not impossible to achieve something if you work hard. At the same time, if there is an opportunity for employment, you can also pursue it. What society needs is your talent, who will come, and who has the right to investigate your background?

### Government Bond Buyers are Extremely Strong Two Weeks, Four Times Limit Up

The government bond gray market rallied sharply yesterday, and with continued heavy selling by major players, both types A and B quickly hit their limit up. Limit ups and limit downs have been seen from time to time in the market in the past two weeks, with limit ups seen four times and limit downs seen twice, which is enough to prove the strong and healthy strength of the bulls. Since the outflow of physical goods, as of yesterday, about 50 million yuan or more has been released, and the market price can still hit the limit up, then it is clear that the buyers are not satisfied with more than 50 million yuan. However, where did this large amount of physical goods go? Considering the overall strength of the industry, it does not have this kind of courage, so it must have been taken away by a strong external force. Then it is not difficult to imagine who this strong force is. There are only a few dozen firms in the government bond market, and they usually kick the ball around because there are only so many floating chips. Only when the environment changes and government bonds are stimulated will there be passive ups and downs. The current situation has broken away from this situation, and there are so many new chips, which completely changes the supply and demand. The market price is higher than before, so what is the reason? The seller's goods can be expected to have no day to recover, then the strong buyer, if not from the financial world, then there is no such huge financial resources. In other words, if there is no such large amount of physical goods flowing out from major players, then it is obvious that the market price will not know how high it will rise. The ups and downs on weekdays are only speculations about the ups and downs in a day or two. Yesterday's limit up for types A and B was nothing more than the courageous absorption by the buyers, and type A and B were relatively cheap, so they rose more than four yuan to the limit up among many competing buyers. Dalihao was still offering prices to absorb after the limit up. The sellers were still mainly Tongliju, followed by Hu Heji, etc. On the surface, it is not easy to explore its actual situation. As a result, types A and B hit the limit up, types C and D rose by 1.5 to 2 yuan, and type E was flat. The turnover was more than 4 million yuan. A simple table is listed below:

### Finance is Difficult to Predict, Re-igniting the Gold Bull Market

The spot gold gray market is rebounding again, and the price has flown out of the 36,000 yuan level. All parties are firm. Although the North Gang has repeatedly spit out, it is difficult to predict the financial changes next Monday. Securities firms are selling factory orders to hedge, and the financial sector is re-entering, re-igniting the bull market. The market opened 500 yuan higher in the morning, at 35,600 yuan. Securities firms sold on behalf of the North Gang, down to 35,400 yuan. Gold shops and silver shops suddenly came to absorb, and retail investors and securities firms also had good appetites. The market price soared by 1,000 yuan, reaching 36,400 yuan. Tianjin Gang sold again, and the rise was blocked, falling back by 200 yuan. The noon close was 36,200 yuan, up 1,100 yuan from the previous day, with a difference of 1,000 yuan. Trading was not scarce, closing at 36,200 to 300 yuan after the market.

Gold jewelry in jewelry stores, each tael was listed up by 50 yuan by Dashin and peers, for a total of 3,550 yuan (reduced by 100 yuan for purchases). Silver was listed at 28 yuan, and the black market was tired at 23.5 yuan and 24 yuan. Silver coins were also soft at 13.5 yuan each.

Two Money Shops Join the Money Reserve

The Shanghai Banking Industry Joint Reserve Committee yesterday sent a circular to all banks and shops, stating that the Money Industry Reserve has approved Tianyi Money Shop and Yuancheng Money Shop of the Yuanzi Tonghang to join the reserve as members. From June 1st, all banks and shops will collect payment instruments from these two shops and entrust the committee to collect them on their behalf. Please handle them in the same way as other member shops, etc.

Recently, there has been a lot of talk about currency in this city, and there has been a rush to deposit and withdraw money from the silver and money industries. Although yesterday was Saturday, the banks were only open for half a day, and there were still many withdrawals. It is heard that the Provisional Joint Association of the Silver and Money Industries will hold a meeting this afternoon to discuss and make a decision on the currency.

### British and American Gold Pounds Continue to Rise

Yesterday's foreign exchange market, the British and American gold pounds each rose by 20 yuan, the former to 780 yuan and the latter to 800 yuan. American dollar bills were still around 40 yuan. Hong Kong dollar bills were still 5.5 yuan. Military tickets opened at 12 yuan in the morning, then fell back to 11.95 yuan, and then rose to 2.2 yuan, up 40 cents from the previous day.

The interest rate for money shops was still listed at 15 cents. The discount rate for drafts was raised from 90 yuan per thousand yuan to 120 yuan, and at noon to 100 yuan, up 10 yuan. The difference between reserve notes was 2.2 yuan per yuan, falling back to 2.17 yuan, at noon 2.2 yuan for cash 2.05 yuan and 2.15 yuan.

### Cotton Yarn Stabilizes, Double Horse Factory Orders Fall

The cotton yarn market initially weakened and then recovered, but the trend is still peaceful, which is actually due to tight credit. 42 count Blue Phoenix was 17,650 yuan to 17,800 yuan, 42 count Yanghe was 17,000 yuan, 60 count Cow Head was 32,400 yuan, 60 count Sunlight was 32,400 yuan, 32 count Fairy Peach was 16,300 yuan to 400 yuan, 20 count Blue Phoenix was 9,700 yuan, 20 count Fengnian was 8,850 yuan, 20 count Tiannv was 8,480 yuan, 20 count Double Globe was 8,480 yuan, 20 count Gold Pagoda was 8,600 yuan, 16 count Fengnian was 8,750 yuan, 10 count Red Treasure was 7,100 yuan to 6,800 yuan, 10 count Red Double Horse was 6,700 yuan. 20 count Horse Factory orders initially opened at 8,850 yuan, and then due to sluggish spot sales and selling by the bulls, the market turned lax and gradually declined to 8,650 yuan, but the closing price was 8,900 yuan.

### Cotton Cloth Seems to Be Waiting

Factory cloth: Yesterday, the cloth market initially looked high due to tight credit, and large players searched for and raised prices, so coarse and fine cloth were stable without gains or losses. Shilin cloth went from weak to firm and rose by 4 or 5 yuan. 16-pound Earth coarse cloth was 370 yuan, Flying Goose was 365 yuan, 12-pound Earth fine cloth was 335 yuan, Fugui was 328 yuan, 9-pound New Character coarse cloth was 205 yuan, Peach Lady Shilin new orders opened at 490 yuan in the morning and recovered to 498 yuan at noon. Old tickets were still 20 yuan lower. Longevity Fuchou was 11.75 yuan, Three Sheep New Strip was 10.05 yuan, Wan Benli was 10.075 yuan, and Volleyball yarn Fuchou was 7.75 yuan. There were not many transactions.

Dongbu: Due to the weekend and financial rumors, transactions were even quieter. 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth new orders opened at 406 yuan and plunged to 382 yuan, closing at 388 yuan. However, after the close, it was heard that Double Horse factory orders rose sharply in the gray market, so there was already demand but no supply. Four Gentlemen Serge red orders opened at 13.7 yuan, and afterwards, buyers and sellers were in a wait-and-see state, once falling slightly to 13.3 yuan, and the closing price was 13.6 yuan, not much different from before.

### Pickled Mustard Tuber Rises 50 Yuan

Wumei Company's Wannianqing brand pickled mustard tuber, due to rising costs, was holding back and not opening. Now, due to very urgent demand from the selling side, more than 400 were opened yesterday, with Wannianqing brand large jars at 580 yuan and the next best Jubao Basin brand large jars at 500 yuan and small jars at 540 yuan, all up 50 yuan from before.

### Cloves Only Rise, No Fall

The source of cloves has been exhausted, and the market inventory is also small, so the price only rises and does not fall. The current market price for large flower cloves has been sold to 50 yuan per catty, and the market is stable.

### Honeysuckle is About to See New Products

Honeysuckle from Tengxian reports that it is now time for new products to be listed, and the attached samples are still good. Approximately a small number will be shipped to Shanghai soon, but transportation is slow and may be after ten days.

### Chinese Yam Dried Small Sales are Not Weak

The bean trade was quite quiet yesterday, probably because there were widespread rumors of financial changes, which led to everyone taking a wait-and-see attitude. The market was scattered and lacked vitality. 100 packages of Tianjin Jinyuan were opened at 340 yuan delivered, and more than 100 packages of Chongming Shachi were opened at 269 yuan to 170 yuan.

Corn transactions were rare, and prices were flat and weak. Only one car of Wuhu corn was opened yesterday, priced at 187 yuan ex-works.

Bean cake transactions were rare both in and out, and the market was scattered. Only 500 pieces of Kaishengji cake new stack orders dated May 20 were sold for 50 yuan.

Small sales of dried Chinese yam were not deserted, with 20 packages sold yesterday at 180 yuan.

### Cigarette Trade is Average

Cigarettes: buyers are holding a wait-and-see attitude, opening with Great Britain Spleen at 13,700 yuan per large box, up 700 yuan from before.
