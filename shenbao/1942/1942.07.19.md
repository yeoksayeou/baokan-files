Stockholm, Sweden, 18th, Domei News Agency - According to news from London, well-informed sources in London recently stated that the British government is paying no attention to the Indian Congress Party's request for renegotiation. This statement indicates that the only avenue for compromise left by the Walter Hall resolution has been closed. The stalemate between India and Britain is brewing.

If this movement threatens the British line of defense in India, the British government will not hesitate to take decisive action.

Stockholm, Sweden, 18th, Haitong News Agency - A Swedish newspaper correspondent in England reported that British government officials stated that if any movement launched by the All-India Congress is enough to endanger the defense of India, Britain will immediately take decisive measures. It is absolutely impossible for the British government to change its attitude towards the Indian seat or make concessions to the Indian Congress Party at this time.

The British government is confident that its position will be supported by Parliament.

### Washington Watching the French Fleet Issue - Hai Henri Visits Welles

Washington, 17th, Havas News Agency - When Secretary of State Hull received reporters today, a reporter asked that if the French fleet anchored in Alexandria were to be sabotaged one day, the opinions of France and the United States differ on who should be responsible. How should this matter be resolved? Secretary of State Hull immediately replied that he would wait to receive information before expressing an opinion. Political figures here believe that Hull's reserved attitude is intended to ease the tone of American newspapers, because some newspapers have made fierce criticisms of the current relationship between France and the United States. The French fleet issue is being closely watched here. Today, French Ambassador to the United States Hai Henri met with Under Secretary of State Welles to discuss the matter. It is expected that consultations will continue within days.

Stockholm, Switzerland, 17th, Havas News Agency - The Lausanne Tribune commented on the current relations between the United States and France, saying, "Regarding the disposition of the Alexandria fleet, Chief Laval has adopted a very tough stance. If the French fleet accepts Admiral Howard's order to sail to the ports selected by Britain and the United States, it would directly contradict the provisions of the Franco-German armistice agreement. France can only accept two solutions: one is that the French fleet will remain in Alexandria regardless of what happens in the future, and the other is to return to France. Chief Laval's stance is entirely based on the obligations France assumed when signing the armistice agreement, so his stance is firm and immovable. We hope that this matter will be resolved smoothly without sinking the French fleet."

### German Special War Report Announces: Capture of Voroshilovgrad

German Supreme Headquarters, 18th, Hai Tong News Agency - The German Military Headquarters issued the following special war report last night, stating that Voroshilovgrad, an important industrial town in the Donets region, has now been captured by the German army after several days of fierce fighting. Many areas are on fire.

German Supreme Headquarters, 18th, Haitong News Agency - This afternoon's German war report, our troops and mechanized units continue to advance southward, have reached the lower reaches of the Don River, annihilated the surrounded enemy troops, and occupied more territory. The German Air Force bombed the enemy and was very active in the lower reaches of the Don River. The retreating Soviet troops south of the Don River were particularly threatened by German aircraft. Luoji and other important areas in the industrial area of the Don River basin were occupied by infantry on July 17. Most of the city was engulfed in flames, which proved the great losses suffered by the Soviet Union after several days of fierce fighting. The enemy troops who attacked the fortresses were repelled. The remaining enemy troops in the rear in the middle of the road are being cleared. South of Lake Ilmen, the elite enemy forces launched an unsuccessful attack. An enemy team once entered our army's position, and our army quickly counterattacked and repelled the enemy.

Stockholm, Switzerland, 18th, Domei News Agency - The Red Army in the Don River bend continues to retreat. Voroshilovgrad, an important industrial area located 100 miles north of Rostov, was also captured by the German army after several days of fierce fighting. Several places in the city are on fire. At the same time, Stalingrad, a city in the lower reaches of the Volga River, is also becoming increasingly dangerous. The Red Army has concentrated all its heavy artillery and tanks to defend this important industrial area. The Red Army authorities have also strictly ordered soldiers to defend the city to prevent the German army from crossing the Volga-Don Canal. Rostov is the gateway to the Caucasus, and it is also becoming tight. There are 15 divisions of German troops attacking in that direction. Fierce fighting is still going on in the area of Voronezh in the upper reaches of the Don River.

Berlin, 18th, Haitong News Agency - Voroshilovgrad, which was broken into by the German army yesterday, is located in the northern end of the Donets coal mining area. The city's industrial progress has been very rapid. In 1933, the city had only 100,000 people. By 1936, it had increased to 213,000. Later, the Soviet Union set up important military equipment industries in the area and expanded the existing coal mining industry, so people continued to increase. The city is the capital of the Voroshilovgrad region of Ukraine. The area covers an area of 36,500 square kilometers and has a population of 1.3 million. There are many iron smelters, locomotive factories, engineering factories, and military equipment factories in the city. The city is located 15 kilometers southwest of the Don River, with multiple railway lines passing through it, and a direct railway to Rostov in the south, so the city is very important in terms of transportation.

Chicago, 18th, Domei News Agency - According to news from Moscow, the situation in the central region of the Soviet-German front suddenly became obviously tense again, because there were signs that the German army was planning to launch a large-scale offensive in the Belinsky area. At the same time, it was heard that the German army set out from Kalinin, Erzhev, Vyazma, and Orel and exerted great pressure on the Soviet defense lines around Moscow.

Stockholm, Sweden, 18th, Havas News Agency - According to yesterday's news from the Eastern Front, the German army has advanced to a certain place 30 miles west of Rostov. Today, it is heard that the east side of the city is also threatened. The defending troops now have to deal with attacks from both sides. It is expected that the battle of Rostov will be similar to the battle of Voronezh.

German Offensive Near Voronezh Encountered Obstacles

Stockholm, Sweden, 17th, Havas News Agency - The recent development of the battle situation on the Eastern Front shows that the German offensive in Voronezh has been frustrated, but the German offensive near the Don River bend is becoming increasingly fierce. Currently, fighting is still going on near the city of Voronezh. The Red Army bulletin stated that the German army launched many local offensives in the area, but they were all repelled. Neutral observers here believe that the German authorities are now replenishing troops and mobilizing new forces in order to launch a decisive battle. The Soviet Air Force is extremely active in the area, bombing German pontoon bridges and barracks without leaving any effort. As for the battles in other areas, Berlin has been taciturn for several days. Only the Red Army General Headquarters issued a war report stating, "Bloody battles occurred northeast of Millerovo. Our army was outnumbered and is retreating to new positions and curbing the enemy's advance on various transportation lines." Also, news from the Soviet official indicated that a large tank battle is currently taking place in the Astakhov area east of Millerovo. The earth-shattering nature of this battle is more than the famous tank battle in the Kharkov area in May. In addition, the Red Army counterattacked on the left bank of the Don River and has reached the city of Migolinskaya, which was captured by the German army three days ago. The Red Army's resistance between Millerovo and Astakhov is fierce, and the German army's eastward advance has been frustrated. It has no choice but to concentrate all its forces southward. The German army is now advancing parallel to the Voronezh-Rostov railway line, with the obvious purpose of reaching the junction of the Don River and the Donets River in order to encircle the Red Army in the Rostov area in one fell swoop. It is heard that the German army has established a pocket-shaped position 30 miles east of Millerovo. According to other news from the Soviet Union, it is learned that Moscow hopes that the battle situation can be stabilized within a few days, but Soviet official and semi-official spokespersons frankly admit that the Red Army's position is still very critical. If Stalingrad falls, the Red Army's morale and strategy will be greatly affected. In the middle section of the front, no major battles have occurred, but the German army is preparing to attack in the areas of Kalinin and Bryansk. As far as the former area is concerned, the Red Army claims to have repeatedly repelled the enemy's offensive, and even consolidated positions in certain places in order to cope with the enemy's general offensive. As far as the latter area is concerned, fierce local battles have also occurred. The German army is concentrating a large army and tank units there.

Berlin, 18th, Haitong News Agency - Military sources here last night denied the Soviet claim of progress in the Voronezh area on the southern route of the Eastern Front, stating that Voronezh has been behind the German battle line for many days. The Soviet troops in the city have completely withdrawn, and a large German army is passing through the city and heading east.

### Soviet Troops Adopt Two-Sided Attacks

Moscow, 18th, Domei News Agency - Millions of German troops are flowing through the countryside, approaching the Caucasus. Soviet troops retreated to the lower reaches of the Don River last night. The German troops advancing towards Rostov and the Caucasus have expanded their area of advance and made a wedge-shaped penetration south from Millerovo. As a result, Kamensk, a railway city in the Don River basin 40 miles away, is closer. Now Stalingrad, an industrial city in the Volga River bend, and Rostov are both under serious threat, and the Soviet troops based in the western corner of the Caucasus are in serious danger of being surrounded by the German troops southeast of Millerovo. After cutting off the important railway traffic between Moscow and Rostov, the German army continued to advance, and is now trying to bypass the north of the Don River basin and attack Rostov from the north, while at the same time rushing to Stalingrad to cut off the entire Caucasus connection. North of Kamensk, there is the Donets River as cover. It is heard that the Red Army has attacked the two sides of the German troops who recently made a wedge-shaped penetration in order to hinder the German army's advance.

### Soviet Aircraft Fly to the Gulf of Finland and Bomb German Warships

### Soviet Union Urgent Need for Emergency Action - Urge Opening of Second Battlefield

Washington, 17th, Havas News Agency - After the German army penetrated deeper and deeper on the Eastern Front, the Soviet Union's diplomatic pressure to request the Allied countries to open a second battlefield increased. The Soviet Union fully acknowledges that dispersing the enemy's forces should be considered purely from a military point of view, but insists that emergency action is needed under the current situation. Soviet newspapers often carry the words of government officials, arguing that a large-scale Allied offensive in Western Europe can at least force the German army to withdraw half of its strength from the Eastern Front in order to cope with this new attack. Both Soviet and British officials acknowledge that opening a second battlefield is extremely dangerous and will affect most countries, but the Soviet side still maintains that no matter how dangerous this matter is, it must be realized.

London, 17th, Havas News Agency - The British Communist Party issued a declaration demanding that the government immediately open a second battlefield.

Lisbon, 18th, Haitong News Agency - According to the Washington Post, before Britain and the United States open a second front, they must first prevent the threat of submarines. According to the Tribune, the Allied countries' opening of a second front depends on the Soviet Union's possession of reserves. When the Allied countries launch an offensive, the British and American troops need the cooperation of the Soviet reserves.

Berlin, 18th, Haitong News Agency - According to the German Foreign Ministry's mouthpiece, the "German Foreign Policy Communication," Britain and the United States' call to open a second front and launch a war in Western Europe violates international law. Article 43 of the Hague Land Warfare Convention stipulates that the occupying country shall be responsible for maintaining order in the occupied area and take strict measures to prevent various difficulties.

In the future, Finland's interests in the US will be handled directly by the Embassy in Washington. It is reported that Finland has a Consulate General in New York, and a total of sixteen consulates throughout the US. Furthermore, local political figures do not overemphasize the US decision to sever consular relations with Finland, as no new incidents have occurred between the US and Finland in recent months that would cause relations to deteriorate. Another dispatch from Washington states that the US State Department has notified the Finnish Minister to the US, Mr. [勃洛髙波], that he or his embassy staff must obtain special permits if they wish to travel throughout the United States in the future.

The relevant authorities are considering specific measures to implement this plan.

### Nanshi Old People's Home

Old people, unless they are your own parents, asking us to patiently serve them for a week or a month, anyone would frown and consider it a thankless task. If you were asked to serve an unrelated old man or an old woman for three or five years, you might think it was a joke. However, there are actually people willing to do it now, without any remuneration, and they serve not just one old person, but dozens or hundreds, and they do it for life, often begging from door to door for these old people. In our history, apart from [武訓], a beggar who built schools, we have not seen a second example. But now there is such a miracle, and this miracle is not far away, right before our eyes.

Speaking of the Nanshi Old People's Home, everyone is somewhat familiar with it, vaguely thinking it's just an institution that takes in poor, helpless old people. But the reality is not that simple. In a so-called charity organization, the person in charge signs in on time and carefully supervises, which is already considered fulfilling their responsibilities. Demanding that they do everything "personally" is just an empty phrase. However, the nuns in the Nanshi Old People's Home, commonly known as "Little Sisters of the Poor" or "Mums," wholeheartedly and joyfully do just that without exception. They serve meals for all 350 male and female elderly residents, help them get up and go to bed, care for them day and night when they are sick, wash their clothes, cook their meals, and even help those who are too weak to bathe and change clothes. When they die, they accompany, comfort, and watch over them until their last breath. In reality, even in families with filial sons and obedient grandchildren, they may not be able to provide these poor old people with such blessings in their old age!

There are fourteen Chinese nuns and twenty foreign nuns in the Old People's Home, all of whom have vowed chastity and to serve the elderly for life. According to regulations, they are not allowed to own land or property to generate income, so their annual operating expenses and supplies all depend on their daily begging. Regardless of cold or heat, rain or wind, they have done this day in and day out for decades. This simple yet great spirit of sacrifice is truly worthy of admiration and praise in today's society.

But what they expect from society is definitely not admiration and praise, but a great deal of sympathy and assistance. Currently, the economy is sluggish, prices are soaring, and the home needs 75 shi of rice per month and 15,000 yuan for all expenses. However, the original wealthy donors have recently felt stretched and unable to help. They are not worried about themselves, but worried about the old people who depend on them for their lives. "Even the cleverest housewife cannot cook without rice," and they don't know how they will manage in the future. However, they have a firm faith, they believe that in human civilized society, there are still some benevolent men and women with chivalrous hearts who will not bear to see their work unable to continue. They are hoping day and night that powerful people will lend a hand. Whether it's money, food, or clothing, no matter how much or how little, good or bad, they accept everything. In this economically turbulent situation where everyone is complaining, use some of your money on this cause that moves heaven and earth, to create blessings for yourself and your children and grandchildren!

### Public Bonds Nearly Stagnant – New Developments

### Assisting the Public Works Department in Cholera Prevention

— Huá

Recently, several cases of true cholera have been discovered in the city. Therefore, the Public Works Department, to ensure the safety of all citizens, is further implementing prevention measures. To protect our own health and the health of our families, we should naturally cooperate closely with the authorities.

The cholera bacteria was discovered in 1883 by Dr. Koch. These bacteria often thrive in water. Patients suffer from vomiting and diarrhea, and the patient's surroundings and feces are all carriers of cholera. Therefore, we should immediately pay attention to the following points:

1.  The lid of the garbage can should be closed tightly to prevent flies from entering, as flies are carriers of the bacteria.
2.  All vegetables and other foods must be washed thoroughly and boiled before consumption.
3.  All drinking water must be boiled. Do not drink raw water.
4.  In the event of a cholera patient, everything near them should be disinfected immediately.
5.  Preserved dishes must be covered with gauze.
6.  Voluntarily get vaccinated at a vaccination site.

### Three Attitudes for Raising Children

— Jìng

The most important thing in raising children is the attitude taken by the parents, and the following three are especially important.

1.  A Humble Attitude: This does not mean that parents should have no confidence in themselves at all, but rather that they should not take a definitive attitude. It has always been assumed that parents' opinions are never wrong, but this is not the case. We should be brave enough to admit mistakes, even in front of our children. For example, if your eldest son says to you, "You never let me do this or that, why can my younger brother do as he pleases?" You can say, "Son, we are bound to make mistakes, especially when you were young, because you were our first child." In this way, the feelings between parents and children will quickly increase, and the children will never lose their respect for their parents.

2.  A Cultivating Attitude: Many parents have no cultivation at all. When they encounter disappointments, they handle things very heavily, or slam the door shut, or stomp their feet in the house, or kick cats and dogs out the door, or even scold and beat their children for no reason. These things leave a very bad impression on the children.

In the family, rules are necessary, but everything should be dealt with in a calm attitude. If parents are always impatient, then the children will learn to imitate them.

3.  A Tolerant Attitude: Everyone is bound to make mistakes, especially children who lack life experience. Therefore, parents should observe their children's behavior from their perspective and gradually teach them the necessary knowledge. If high standards are set without starting from the lower levels, it will never be possible to cultivate good habits in the children.

But the tolerance mentioned here is to raise children calmly and give them some leeway, not to simply tolerate and let them run wild.

### Cholera Prevention

— Yú Lìrén

The terrible true cholera has been repeatedly discovered in the city, and its lethality is imminent and spreading. No wonder everyone talks about it with terror and everyone is fearful. It is essential to pay close attention to how to recognize this disease and how to prevent it.

According to this disease's pathogen, it is a comma-shaped bacillus that is unique to this disease. The shape of the bacteria is mostly slightly curved, the size of a cochlea is short and thick, and multiple bacteria are connected in a spiral or S shape. It can live in food for seven or eight days, and in fly intestines for at least three days. It dies quickly when exposed to dryness and acids. The important vehicles of transmission of this disease are summarized below.

The excrement of cholera patients is thrown into water or on riverbanks, wellsides, and washing of patients' clothes and tableware, etc., causing the water to be often mixed with cholera bacteria. Once ingested, it is extremely easy to be infected. It is also extremely easy to transmit during the summer and autumn months when there are many flies.

This disease can be roughly divided into three types: Simple cholera diarrhea, six to eight times a day, cured in several days to a week. Similar cholera symptoms, watery diarrhea several times, then turns into rice water-like diarrhea, vomiting as well, reduced urine output, cold and pale hands and feet, fatigue, calf muscle pain, if treated properly, diarrhea will stop after 24 hours, but there is a possibility of turning into true cholera. True cholera, the incubation period of the bacteria is uncertain, about two to five days, the diarrhea may be sudden without warning, headache, vomiting, general weakness, decreased body temperature, cold sweats, rapid and weak pulse, decreased or complete cessation of urination, painless rice water-like vomiting and diarrhea, twenty to thirty times a day, sunken eye sockets, cold and clammy skin, purplish-blue, muscle spasms, difficulty breathing, death in a few hours to a few days, there are also those who pass through without diarrhea, this is called dry cholera. In short, no matter which type, you should seek medical attention immediately.

As the saying goes: "An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure." As far as cholera is concerned, prevention is essential. Those suffering from this disease should be sent to infectious disease hospitals immediately, and strict disinfection and sterilization methods should be carried out indoors to prevent spread. Those who have not been infected should be vaccinated as soon as possible. Special attention should be paid to diet during the prevalence of this disease. The main cause of infection with this disease is drinking water or food contaminated with cholera bacteria, so do not drink unboiled water, do not eat uncooked or rotten melons and fruits, and food touched by flies. These are essential principles to be followed in preventing cholera. In addition, pay attention to cleanliness and eliminate dirt and stagnant water, carry out street, alley, and household cleaning, pay attention to nutrition and hygiene, get up early and go to bed early every day, eat in moderation to increase resistance, do not worry or be depressed, and do not go to public places if you have nothing to do. All these are urgent matters. As for those suffering from diarrhea, they should seek medical attention immediately to avoid triggering this disease.

### One Thing Learned in Housework

— Yín Shēng

Rice: Place several chilies or two or three crab shells in the rice jar (or box) to keep the rice from being infested for a long time.

Books: Hide rue (also known as seven-mile fragrance) in the bookcase to ward off insects.

Vase Water: In summer, putting a piece of tile burned by fire in the water will prevent it from smelling; in winter, putting sulfur in it will prevent it from freezing.

Pears: Separate pears from radishes and do not let them touch. Store them in bamboo baskets (avoid wooden utensils) to keep them from spoiling for a year.

Clothes Trunk: Place floating alum stone (available at pharmacies) in the four corners of the trunk to absorb moisture and prevent moths forever.

Dog and cat mange: Mix sulfur with rice and feed it to them for extreme effect.

Chicken plague: Also, feed raw sulfur down their throats for extreme effect.

Cholera Prevention: In summer, dishes should preferably be vegetarian. It is even better to eat more sour vinegar to prevent the spread of cholera bacteria (because cholera bacteria are afraid of acidity). However, those who already have symptoms of cholera should quickly seek medical attention and not delay.

### Are You Shy?

— Hú Róng

Huì'ér refused to attend her cousin's wedding because she had no new clothes to wear. She said, "It's so embarrassing to meet relatives in old clothes." Her father said, "What's embarrassing about that? In the eyes of far-sighted people, a clean old piece of clothing is easier to get sympathy and trust than a new silk dress. As long as you have knowledge and ability, it doesn't matter if your clothes are a bit old. If you have no knowledge or ability, even if you dress up like a fairy, others will still look down on you."

Mom asked Mǐn'ér to fetch water, but Mǐn'ér refused to go. He said, "It's so ugly to walk on the street with a copper kettle. If I run into my classmates, wouldn't they laugh their heads off?" Mom said, "Child, you're wrong. You're fetching water to help the family, and others will definitely say you're diligent. They'll never laugh at you. Remember, working is not a shameful thing. Gluttony, laziness, and wrongdoing are truly shameful!"

Little friends! Have you ever refused to attend a banquet or do something because of unnecessary shame? If you have, please remember the words of the father and mother above.

### Health Exercise Method (4)

The Mài's health exercise method has a total of twenty-seven exercises, divided into three groups. The first group of exercises has been published in the previous issue. Starting with this issue, the second and third groups, namely the tenth to nineteenth and twentieth to twenty-seventh exercises, will be published continuously. Please pay attention.

The twenty-seven health exercises are a combination of simple and complex. Although there is a difference in difficulty during practice, their function of promoting health and increasing resistance is the same. Moreover, it is not restricted by time and place, and there is no need to rely on equipment. Everyone in the family can practice it, which is of great help to improving family health and happiness.

The twelfth diagram published in this issue is a more complex one. During practice, you must concentrate your thoughts to make the movements consistent. Although it is more difficult to start, practice makes perfect. Over time, you will be able to master it and operate it freely.

Health care is not something that can be achieved overnight. Only by holding on to the spirit of "never giving up", practicing every day according to the method, and not neglecting the seemingly simple ones, and not stopping because of the difficult methods, can you definitely achieve the goal of ensuring health.

(Diagram 10 and 11)

Lie flat on your back, with your hands close to your waist and your legs apart. Raise your left leg and right arm, and rotate your leg in a circle. When rotating, you should rotate to the inside as shown in the arrow in the picture, without touching the ground. At the same time, rotate your right arm in a circle, from the inside to the outside. Repeat six times to record as one time.

The eleventh exercise method is exactly the same as the above action, but you should raise your right leg and left arm, and also repeat six times.

According to the above two methods, all parts of the shoulders, chest, legs, and arms can get sufficient exercise, and using the legs and arms to rotate in a circle gives the muscles and tendons, or their main parts, new opportunities for activity, which is especially beneficial.

(Diagram 12)

Lie flat on your back, raise your legs up at right angles, stretch your arms straight up, close to your legs, and rotate both circles at the same time. The left leg and left arm rotate to the left, and the right arm and right leg rotate to the right. When rotating, from the outside to the inside, do not touch the ground with your hands and feet. Repeat six times, counting a circle as one time.

According to this exercise, you should focus your mind to achieve the goal of balanced development of actions.

### Replies to Letters Concerning Health Exercises

Since this publication published the Mài's health exercise method on the 28th of last month, it has received many letters from readers, raising many questions about practice time, place, etc. It can be seen that readers are eager for health needs. The various questions asked are answered as follows.

The effects of practicing in the morning or evening are the same.

There is no difference before or after meals, but of course, you need to rest for a considerable amount of time after meals.

It can be done on the bed or on the ground, but of course, a soft bed that has lost its elasticity is not suitable for practice. After finishing the exercise, if you feel tired, you can rest for a while, otherwise, there is no need.

(Above answers to Mr. Ní Yōngxuān)

For the second exercise, do it fifteen times first, rest briefly, then do it fifteen times, rest for a moment, and then do twenty-five times.

The third and fourth exercises are the same. The so-called do not touch the ground when returning to the original position means that you can only touch the ground after doing it six times.

Due to space and picture limitations, we can only publish it one after another, but within the possible scope, we will publish it as soon as possible. (Above answer to a reader)

### One-Week Regular Menu

— Ms. Huá Yīng

Eggplant has only been on the market for less than a month, and it's not that expensive now. There are two types of eggplant, local and Níngbō. To make an analogy to the human body, the one produced locally is short and fat, and the one produced in Níngbō is thin and long, which is like Laurel and Hardy in American comedy films. The savory method is to dig out the seeds, stuff them with minced meat, and add side-tip mushrooms and other auxiliary products, and braise them together. There are also those who use chicken oil to braise them together. There is this kind of practice in Sichuan cuisine, and diners regard it as a delicacy. There are also those who drag eggplants with flour, eggs, etc. You can wash the eggplants, peel them, cut them into shuttle-shaped pieces, mix the eggs and flour to make a paste, drag the eggplants in it, then fry them in oil, and you can eat them when they are slightly yellow and crispy. Dip it in spicy soy sauce and you can drink with it. For vegetarian dishes, it is best to braise with sweet sauce until soft and rotten. For something simpler, just steam them until soft on the rice pot and eat them mixed with sauce sesame oil or sesame sauce.

Monday: Eggplant Stuffed with Minced Meat, Sweet and Sour Salted Hairtail, Braised Cabbage, Tofu with Toon
