### Singapore's Northern Region: British Troops Establish New Positions; The Island's Fate Hinges on Reinforcements; British Forces Retreat from Myanmar along the Salween River

Stockholm, 1st (Haitong News Agency) – The Malayan campaign has ended, and the battle for Singapore has begun. Following repeated defeats, British forces, facing large-scale offensives by Japanese troops, have abandoned mainland positions and retreated to Singapore Island. Approximately 750,000 British, Indian, Australian troops, Singaporean defenders, and civilians, having escaped the Japanese encirclement strategy, are crowded into an area of 220 square miles, awaiting the Japanese advance. Ground, naval, and air forces have established positions in the northern part of Singapore Island, preparing for a desperate battle, hoping to hold the island until reinforcements arrive from the Southwest Pacific Allied forces, and to resist Japanese attacks for several weeks.

British troops who had been resisting Japanese attacks have retreated by night. Rearguard units are holding the causeway connecting Singapore Island to the mainland, covered by artillery fire. After the rearguard units have completely withdrawn to Singapore Island, British engineers will detonate the causeway, it is said. Rangoon, 1st (Reuters) – Rangoon sounded air raid alarms for the third time yesterday. During the first two alarms, defensive fighter planes patrolled at high altitude, engaging Japanese aircraft dropping leaflets. New York, 1st (Reuters) – American newspapers today prominently headline the encirclement of Singapore. General opinion seems to be that the fate of Singapore hinges on air power and the ability to deploy reinforcements, making the reports of some reinforcements en route to Singapore particularly encouraging. Johor Front, 1st (Domei News Agency) – Japanese troops advancing south along the New Johor Road entered Johor Bahru at 4:40 PM yesterday. Johor Bahru is located at the southern tip of the Malay Peninsula, separated from the Singapore fortress by only three-quarters of a mile of the Johor Strait.

Tokyo, 1st (Domei News Agency) – The Japanese General Headquarters announced today that the vanguard of Japanese troops attacking Singapore from the south had broken through British defenses and reached the area directly facing the British fortress of Singapore Island last night. The announcement also summarized the Japanese military situation in Malaya, stating that the Japanese troops, from their initial landing in Malaya, took 55 days to reach the northern district, covering a distance of approximately 650 kilometers. During this period, the Japanese troops repaired 250 bridges, engaged the enemy in 92 battles, and captured a large amount of enemy spoils. London, 31st (Reuters) – Singapore has now entered a phase of independent defense. The vastly outnumbered British garrison is now separated from the Japanese forces in Malaya by only three-quarters of a mile of water. With the Japanese in control of the sea, the Allies can only provide peripheral assistance to the island for the time being. Fighter planes taking off from Sumatra and other Dutch East Indies bases can attack Japanese forces invading Singapore. There are three airfields on Singapore Island, but a stepped-up Japanese air raid is expected, and their artillery will also be deployed. Singapore's defenses include some of the world's largest-caliber heavy guns, intended to defend against naval attacks, but it is extremely difficult to defend against Japanese forces besieging from the Johor coast, it is said.

Rangoon, 31st (Reuters) – British land and air forces issued a joint communique today stating that Moulmein was subjected to a fierce four-pronged Japanese attack yesterday. The first attack was repelled in the morning. In the afternoon, the Japanese launched a second attack, and we counterattacked to recover the situation. At night, our small force in Moulmein defended against the Japanese attacks until dawn. During this time, the Japanese forces advanced into the suburbs, and the battle is still in progress. After our troops moved all equipment and storage out of Moulmein, they retreated to the opposite bank of the Salween River. The Japanese attack was assisted by intense aerial activity. Japanese planes mainly targeted Martaban. An alarm was sounded in Rangoon today, but details of the bombing of Martaban are not yet known. During the day, our planes scouted Japanese troop movements twice, but no Japanese planes attacked Rangoon during the alarm, it is said. Rangoon, 31st (Havas) – The British military headquarters here has just released a battle report stating that British forces in Myanmar withdrew from the city of Moulmein this morning, carrying all supplies and military equipment, and retreated along the Salween River. Moulmein is one of Myanmar's three major cities, second only to Rangoon and Meng. Rangoon, 1st (Reuters) – The British Air Force Command announced yesterday that Japanese forces yesterday used a large number of aircraft to cover attacks on Moulmein in several directions. The first attack in the morning was repelled by our troops. In the afternoon, our troops counterattacked in hopes of restoring the original line. The Japanese troops attacked repeatedly in the evening. Although the defending troops were few, they repelled repeated attacks. Our troops withdrew to the other side of the Salween River the next day, after moving various military supplies from Moulmein beforehand.

Tokyo, 1st (Haitong News Agency) – Japanese troops are currently advancing towards Mawlamyine in two directions, one along the coast from the south and the second from Thailand towards the east. Fierce battles occurred on Saturday, with Japanese aircraft bombing trains heading towards Rangoon, it is said.

Dutch East Indies Prepared to Destroy All Oil Wells, Regardless of Sacrifice

Batavia, 1st (Reuters) – It was announced here today that the Dutch East Indies authorities have implemented a scorched-earth policy according to plan, and whenever necessary, they will follow the example of Tarakan and Balikpapan in carrying out thorough destruction. The destruction of oil refining equipment is the most dangerous, but no demolition workers have died as a result. All remaining oil-producing areas, large and small, throughout the Dutch East Indies now have well-trained demolition teams standing by, ready to deploy. Detailed plans have been drawn up, and once the time comes, they can be followed according to the map. Bangkok, 1st (Haitong News Agency) – This location received news from Batavia, describing the destruction of oil wells and facilities in Tarakan and Balikpapan, Borneo, by the Dutch East Indies authorities. It is said that the success of the Dutch destruction of the oil fields was due to thorough prior planning. The objects of destruction were divided into several areas according to geographical features. When demolition teams carried out the destruction, there were also strict regulations. Attention was also paid to the direction of the wind. Experience was applied. The demolition teams prepared frequently and practiced, so that when they worked, they were unusually skilled, even in dark places. The demolition teams in each area maintained contact with each other so as not to interfere with each other's work. The Dutch East Indies started training demolition teams at the beginning of the European war and stepped up preparations afterwards, so when the time came, the destruction work proceeded very smoothly, it is said.

Saigon, 1st (Haitong News Agency) – The "Batavia Daily" commented on the situation created by the current military developments in Australia, saying that the distance puts Australia in an advantageous position, but even so, Japanese forces will still launch a direct land attack on Australia or threaten Australia's overseas transportation lines. The Japanese landing in Rabaul proves that the Japanese are making every effort to isolate Australia. The Japanese are now taking a semicircular encirclement line, closing in on the Dutch East Indies and preventing Australian assistance from coming east, which all depends on maintaining Allied transportation lines. Saigon, 1st (Haitong News Agency) – This location received a telegram from Batavia stating that the Japanese forces landed in Ambon with three cruisers, six destroyers, and four transport ships. This location is located on Ambon Island. The area of Ambon Island is 297 square miles. The island has two peninsulas, one called Hitu and one called Leitimor. For hundreds of years, Ambon has been the commercial center of the Maluku Islands. The harbor is 20 to 30 meters deep and has docks and warehouse facilities. The island's main product is sago. The entire island is mountainous and suitable for guerrilla warfare. The island has a population of approximately 50,000, mostly Christians. Ambon's most famous historical site is Fort Victoria, built in the early 17th century. It stands by the water and is extremely magnificent. Ambon Island has experienced several earthquakes, and there are still traces of destruction visible today, it is said. Tokyo, 1st (Haitong News Agency) – According to the Japanese Imperial General Headquarters, Japanese forces have occupied Pontianak on the west coast of Dutch Borneo. The city has a population of 50,000 and is an important base for defending Borneo and Java. The Dutch East Indies authorities have announced that they will defend the city at any cost. After the Japanese forces occupied the city, Java, western Java, and eastern Sumatra are all feeling threatened. Batavia, only 800 kilometers away from Pontianak, is especially threatened, it is said.

### British Prime Minister Fails to Provide Assurances, Australian Fears Remain Unrelieved; Government Mobilizes National Male and Female Workers and Organizes People's Army for Guerrilla Warfare Training

Stockholm, 1st (Haitong News Agency) – After Australia obtained the right to send representatives to attend the British War Cabinet and establish the Pacific War Council, it still criticized the policies of the Central Country. After Churchill assured that the shipping lines between Britain and Australia would be protected by the American fleet, Australians are still afraid that the Australian issue will be regarded as secondary by Britain. Australians also doubt whether the representatives of Australia, New Zealand, and the Dutch East Indies in the Allied War Council will only have the qualifications of advisors. Australian Prime Minister Curtin will return to Melbourne today to attend the Australian War Cabinet meeting and announce the results of negotiations with the British military authorities. Australian Foreign Minister Evatt announced that Australia and the Dutch East Indies have established direct diplomatic relations. The Dutch Minister to Iran will be reassigned to Australia, and the Australian envoy to London will be the Dutch government minister to Australia, it is said. Melbourne, 31st (Havas) – The Australian Federal Government has approved a decree stipulating that all male and female workers in the country should engage in work that is most beneficial to the country.

### Stalemate in North African Campaign

Berlin, 31st (Havas) – An official communique recently issued stated that in North Africa, both sides' activities are limited to scout troops. A German fighter squadron flew to northern Libya and dispersed British motorcycle units. Berlin, 1st (Haitong News Agency) – A military expert supplemented yesterday's German military report to Haitong News Agency, stating that the recapture of Benghazi will allow future campaigns in North Africa to begin. Benghazi has changed hands four times. The city is an important supply base for the British invasion of Tripoli. Yesterday's Italian military report also stated that in addition to capturing a large number of British troops, a large amount of spoils were seized in Benghazi. Recent battles have revealed that Indian troops in North Africa are unwilling to sacrifice their lives for the benefit of Britain. The Italian military report specifically mentioned the fact that when Italian troops attacked Jebel, an entire battalion of Indian troops surrendered. Near Benghazi, a company of Indian troops also surrendered. Under the heavy pressure of the Axis forces, the British troops had to retreat eastward. Axis aircraft are actively bombing the British retreat and supply lines. Since January 20, even under windy and rainy conditions, Axis forces have advanced 250 kilometers towards the British positions, while defeating the British advance forces, including armored vehicle units.

### Significant Progress by Southern Route Soviet Forces: German Liaison between Kharkov and the Don River Cut Off

Moscow, 30th (Reuters) – The Soviet capture of Ukraine is of great significance from both a political and military perspective at the present time. The German liaison between Kharkov and the Don River basin has been cut off by the Soviets. The southern route of the Soviet army is progressing very smoothly. It is hard to believe that the Soviet army has now advanced to the Lozova area, only 80 miles from the Dnieper River, when we recall the German breakthrough in Ukraine last fall. The Soviet-German war can be compared to a wrestling match. At the beginning, the Soviet Union took a defensive position, but now it has reached an important juncture, and the enemy is tired and exhausted because they have failed to win. The Soviet Union has begun to win, or rather, the Soviet Union has already achieved important victories on all fronts. The Soviet government knows that it must continue to strike the enemy hard at this time, so that when the enemy attacks again, it will not have a major impact. The Red Star newspaper commented that the Soviet Union will never allow a single German soldier in Ukraine to survive, and that 1943 must see the recovery of Ukraine and other occupied areas. The Red Star newspaper also stated that 400 villages have been recovered within Ukraine, and the Soviet army is continuing to advance. As a result of the developments on the southern and southwestern fronts, the crisis of the enemy launching a breakthrough to attack the Volga and the Caucasus, and to seek access to the Black Sea and the Near East, has been reduced. The Soviet Union's efforts to block the German army have greatly helped the position of the Allied countries. British Prime Minister Churchill clearly pointed this out. The Prime Minister's speech has been widely published in major Soviet newspapers. The Soviet press also attaches great importance to the conclusion of the Anglo-Soviet (Iranian) Mutual Assistance Treaty, believing that the domestic situation in Iran caused by the military actions last summer can thereby develop, and that the treaty is also beneficial to the defense of India and the Near East, and is of especially great value to the Soviet Union. London, 31st (Reuters) – After capturing Lozova and crossing Smolensk and Kharkov, Soviet forces are now continuing to advance on the central, southern, and southwestern fronts. According to the latest Soviet communique, our army continues to engage the enemy, making continuous progress and occupying several strongholds.

Berlin, 1st (Haitong News Agency) – According to the German authorities, fierce battles occurred between German and Soviet forces northeast of Orel on the night of January 28. German forces drove out Soviet troops from several villages. All enemy counterattacks failed. In other areas of the central route, German forces retook 16 villages. Soviet troops encountered heavy artillery fire and were unable to advance, it is said.

### Household Registration Survey Underway in Sections; Taxpayers Should Await Defense Grouping by Business Associations

Defense Corps Members Divided into Four Groups

Because the Police Department has to transfer 600 police officers to take on this survey work, the police force needs the assistance of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps to carry out the work.

### Ying Yin Buried; Resting in Hongqiao Cemetery

After Ying Yin's body was placed in a coffin on the 24th of last month, it was temporarily placed in the International Funeral Home. At that time, her girlfriend, Ms. Li Yan, telephoned Ying Yin's family in Peiping. Ying Yin's parents are deceased, but she has one older brother and two older sisters.

The organizers of this visa program requested the Shanghai Municipal Council authorities to simplify the process, which has been approved. From today, the new application forms issued last Friday by each visa office will be abolished, and a mimeographed application form will be issued instead. The application will be filled out on a per-person basis, with simplified procedures. The application forms issued last Friday and Saturday will all be collected and replaced with new forms today.

### Pushan Villa Staging a Play to Raise Funds

Since its establishment, Pushan Villa has been committed to charitable causes for 30 years. At present, the work is becoming increasingly extensive. Since the beginning of winter, a large number of people have died of freezing and starvation, all of whom have been buried by Pushan Villa. The number is nearly 2,000 each month. Currently, the price of coffins has become increasingly expensive, almost ten times higher than before the war. As a result, the funds are greatly strained. In view of this, founder Wang Junsheng has launched a fundraising play. Yu Pai's famous actress, Ms. Li Xia, and Yuan Shihai, along with actors, will perform "Entrusting the Dream" and "Knocking on the Tablet" out of goodwill. Yu Zhenfei, the host of Tingfeng House, and actors will perform "A Small Banquet". Actors Furong Cao and Liu Binkun will perform "Capturing Alive". Ms. Wen Yingxia is highly skilled and is scheduled to perform at the Golden Theatre on February 9th. Please, people from all walks of life, generously purchase tickets for the benefit of the exposed and the merit is immeasurable.

### Small Soccer Charity Match: Dragon Team and Samsung Both Triumph; Portuguese and Beixi Children Suffer Miserable Defeats

The small soccer charity match took place at Guangxia Stadium starting at 1:00 PM yesterday afternoon, with thousands of spectators and a tense atmosphere. In the exhibition match, Guohua defeated the Fat Team 4-1. Film stars Lai Zhang Huichong, Xu Liang, and Huang Shaofen led their team to a 2-1 victory over Beibei. The Dragon Team defeated Portugal 8-1, and Samsung defeated Beixi Children 6-1. The two Western teams were composed of members of the International Volunteer Corps. Yesterday, all team members were assisting, so they could not spare the effort and could only send reserve players, resulting in a miserable defeat. Since Gao Baozheng and Yuan Kun of the Dragon Team returned, their fortune in soccer has indeed turned for the better. Baozheng scored a goal with a header within seconds of the start of the game, opening the scoring. Before long, Jiang Chao committed a foul, and Fafanxiao scored a free kick. Zhang Lin'gen and Gao Baozheng both scored, and the Dragon Team took a 2-1 lead in the first half. When the second half started, Portugal became even more unsupported. Yuan Kuntian quickly broke through two defenses. Gao Baozheng scored again, and Zhou Wenkui added the finishing touch. When time expired, the Dragon Team defeated Portugal 8-1. In the final match, Wu Shaotai and Yu Zhenyue scored. In the first half, Samsung won 2-0. In the second half, Wu Shaotai and Xiao Ziwen both scored, and Yu Zhenyue bravely led the team, scoring five goals in a row. Beixi Children's Fafanxiao scored with a header, but Shaotai immediately returned the favor. As a result, Samsung won 6-1.

### Reader Scholarship Fund: Supporting Struggling Students

The list of approved recipients for the Reader Scholarship Fund has been published successively since yesterday. The number of applicants in the second session is approximately double that of the previous session, and the average amount of scholarship applied for has also increased by approximately double. The total amount of scholarship donations currently available is only over 55,000 yuan, which is far less than the enthusiasm of the previous session, making it difficult for those in charge to allocate the funds.

The main reason for the increase in the number of applicants is the cessation of other newspapers and private scholarship organizations that handle scholarship work, leading to a flocking of impoverished students who originally applied elsewhere to our newspaper. The general increase in fees charged by various schools this semester has made it impossible for parents who could barely afford their children's education expenses to cope, but they are unwilling to let their children drop out of school, so applying for this newspaper's scholarship has become their only hope. There are many students with excellent academic performance and extremely poor families, and we are unwilling to disappoint them despite the limited scholarship funds. However, due to the limited scholarship funds, it has added many difficulties to the review process. In order to save these hard-working young people from dropping out of school halfway, and to prepare the foundation for the next scholarship session, we have no choice but to appeal to all sectors of society again. This work is highly anticipated by society, and our colleagues are striving to do their best. We earnestly hope that people from all walks of life will continue to be as enthusiastic as they have been in the past and enthusiastically donate to complete the righteous act of providing scholarships.

### Stage and Screen

— Tai Xu

After "The Biography of Second Master," Lafayette will present "Wang Baochuan." The script is originally by Xiong Shiyi, which was performed in London for as long as nine months. Tang Ying, whom the people of Shanghai may have already forgotten, also performed it in English at the Lyceum Theatre. However, the original work has quite a few "fooling foreigners" aspects, and Lafayette will adopt the strengths of the original work (such as being close to an opera form) and revise it.

The "official business" with the stage and veteran actress Ying Baolian has been settled. Yesterday, she made a guest appearance in "Attacking Zi Du." Ying is already over fifty years old. Her collaboration with Zhao Ruquan is truly a battle between two old men. However, many recent martial arts actors have adopted a "suicide policy." With the old men in front, they should also know how to take care of themselves.

17. Destiny

"I was just casually talking to you about this. I don't necessarily want to be a matchmaker. Let's wait until your health is much better before we talk about it!" Old Han added a few light words and stood up, planning to say goodbye and go downstairs.

"Do you... do you know... what he is... still... studying... or... doing what...?" He was clearly moved by what Old Han said.

Old Han also understood that his emotions must be very chaotic at this time.

"According to what he told me, he is currently studying at the university, and his father runs a silk shop," he replied with a smile.

Qiuhaitang was silent for a long time after hearing this.

But when Old Han comforted him a few words, turned around, and slowly walked out the door, he vaguely heard him say intermittently in bed:

"Starting tonight... still... not... not let... Meibao... go... out... that's good."

However, in the evening, he did not really stop Meibao. He did not mention the words he had heard from Old Han during the day to Meibao. Just before Meibao changed her clothes and was about to go out, he used a trembling right hand to stroke her hand, her face, and her body for a long time. At the same time, Meibao also discovered under the electric light that two tears the size of soybeans were rolling out of the corner of her father's eye.

"Dad, it seems like your appetite hasn't been good these days. If you feel uncomfortable anywhere, please tell me quickly. Good Dad, I'll tell the doctor tomorrow morning!" Meibao asked with a bitter face, standing in front of the bed. (322)
