This time, I have been specially appointed by His Majesty the Emperor to visit your country in return for Chairman Wang's visit. Now that I have arrived in the capital, Nanjing, I would like to say a few words. Recalling the relations between Manchukuo and China, they have been established since the joint declaration by Manchukuo, China, and Japan in November of the previous year. The inherent relationship has been maintained ever since, and the friendship is growing day by day. In addition to expressing my gratitude to Chairman Wang, I also intend to have a thorough discussion with the officials and people of your country, so that the hearts of the two peoples can be more closely connected. Since the beginning of recorded history, today's era can be said to be a period of unprecedented great transformation. The Japanese army continues to achieve glorious victories, and the various ethnic groups of East Asia are taking this opportunity to revive the spirit of East Asia's resurgence. Therefore, the unification of your country will soon be achieved, of this there is no doubt. As for the British and Americans, who harbor ambitions to invade Asia, they have been successively defeated in East Asia and are on the verge of collapse. At this opportune moment, the people of our Manchukuo and China must help each other, encourage each other, and work together towards the great cause of the revitalization of Asia. This is what I hope for."

### Fierce Battle Near Baotou; Japanese Troops Occupy Yingmengzhao; Japanese Troops in Jiangxi Province Occupy Chongren City

On the 6th, a large-scale battle in the sands took place near Yingmengzhao, 40 kilometers south of Baotou, after which the area was occupied. Meanwhile, Japanese tank units continued their fierce pursuit. Since the start of this operation, such a great victory has been achieved in just two days.

Tokyo, 8th (Central News Agency dispatch) - According to a dispatch from the Zhejiang front lines, after occupying Fuzhou on the 5th, Japanese troops continued to advance southwest. After 1:10 PM on the 8th, they occupied Chongren County, the rear base of the 79th Army. At the same time, another unit of the Japanese army advanced south and reached the Yihuang area at 4:00 PM.

Huazhong Front, 8th (Domei News Agency dispatch) - After Japanese troops captured Fuzhou in Jiangxi Province on Friday, they crossed the Lin River and advanced in a southwesterly direction towards Yihuang. They occupied Chongren at 1:10 PM today (the rear base of the 79th Army). Other powerful Japanese units advanced south and reached the Yihuang area at 4:00 PM this afternoon. Japanese planes bombed Shangrao, the headquarters of the Third War Zone, today, and military targets were seen exploding and damaged.

Tokyo, 8th (Central News Agency dispatch) - According to a dispatch from the South China front lines, Japanese troops suddenly launched a fierce attack on the Chongqing army entrenched in the mountains on the south bank of the Jiangbei River, a tributary of the Bei River, at dawn on the 8th. At 7:20 AM, they occupied Huidong Mountain (5 kilometers north of Yuantan Market), and pressed the Chongqing army.

### Gaida Discusses Italian Food Problem

Guangzhou, 8th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Since the Japanese army occupied Yuantan Market, it has been preparing to continue the battle and began the attack at dawn on the 8th.

Rome, 7th (Havas News Agency dispatch) - Gaida, a famous journalist and mouthpiece of Mussolini, recently published an article in the Italian People's Voice, discussing the current food problem in Italy, believing that it is not as serious as during the First World War. He stated, "Recalling the years 1914 to 1918, Italy's situation was indeed sometimes on the verge of danger, and the people's suffering from food rationing was almost unbearable. As for the present, although we have had two poor harvests, the food rationing situation is still bearable. What is noteworthy is that since 1915, Italy's population has increased by ten million, and the increase in food consumption is actually due to the improvement of general living standards. At the same time, Italy cannot import food from overseas as it did during the First World War, which is also a difference between the past and the present. In 1918, Italy's food imports totaled 600 million lira, only reducing the average annual import volume before the war by 110 million lira. However, this is not the case this time. It can be seen that the reason why Italy has been able to resist to this day is entirely due to the development of its own resources and the success of the 'Wheat War'. As a result of the Wheat War, wheat production has increased from 40 million quintals per year to 79 million quintals. However, we cannot say that Italy's food situation is satisfactory, especially in major cities. The people must endure great sacrifices, which is what the Fascist government admits. It is also necessary to accept this sacrifice and maintain discipline and work harder. All hope is pinned on the final victory. In short, the good qualities of the Italian people will undoubtedly lead the motherland to success. As for the food rationing method, it is a common phenomenon during wartime and cannot be avoided. Even some European countries that still maintain peace have already implemented this system."

When the submarine was attacked by British aircraft, it had just left the port of Avilés after two days of repairs. The British aircraft dropped three bombs, none of which hit the target, but the submarine was damaged by shrapnel. The attack on the submarine was witnessed by the lighthouse keeper of Cabo de Mania, Spain, who immediately reported everything to the Spanish naval headquarters in Santa Tecla. The local naval authorities dispatched a tugboat to the scene and towed the damaged vessel to the port of Santa Tecla. One British aircraft was shot down by the submarine's anti-aircraft guns.

### Fierce Fighting Continues in Libya; Front Lines Difficult to Distinguish; Germany Expresses Optimism About Military Situation; Britain Claims to Hold Firm to Triangle Area

Lisbon, 7th (Domei News Agency dispatch) - German troops in North Africa have launched a fierce offensive against British positions. According to United Press International in Cairo, General Rommel's mechanized forces are attacking the anti-Axis Allied mechanized divisions near Night Bridge (approximately 24 kilometers east of the German positions on the Gazala Line). The Allies are fighting back, and a fierce battle has broken out this afternoon. The scale of the tank battle is unprecedented in this Libyan war. The Axis forces are attacking through gaps in the Gazala Line. General Rommel is personally commanding the operation from the front lines in the Night Bridge area.

Somewhere on the Libyan Border, 7th (Havas News Agency dispatch) - The great battle in Libya is raging, and it is difficult to distinguish which side is advancing or retreating. According to news from Cairo, British troops are holding firm to the Tamur, Harmat, and Knight's Bridge triangle area. Tamur is west of Knight's Bridge, and British troops occupied it two days ago. Harmat is southwest of Knight's Bridge, and British troops occupied it just 20 hours ago. The German forces seem to attach great importance to this position. The intensity of the fighting in this area is unprecedented in the North African theater. The German-Italian allied forces have almost retreated east from their starting point yesterday and are currently adjusting their forces in order to concentrate their counterattack. At the same time, the heavy artillery is very active and is planning to coordinate with the infantry. However, the British troops in the Harma area are currently doing their best to resist the fierce attacks of the German-Italian allied forces. In short, the German objective is clearly to destroy the British resistance line from both east and west. For the British, their goal is to disrupt the lines of communication between the Axis forces' bases in the west.

German Headquarters, 8th (Reuters dispatch) - This afternoon's German war report stated that fierce fighting is continuing in North Africa.

Berlin, 8th (Reuters dispatch) - The German High Command's regarding the military situation in Libya, a break in the silence since the 13th, is sufficient to prove that the German military is extremely optimistic about the situation in Marmarica. This is the usual practice of the German authorities; when the war has not yet been won, they do not want to talk about the development of the war. "Deutsche Nachrichten" stated, "Saturday's semi-official news also stated that the Libyan war had favorable developments, and Sunday's communique announced a great victory, indicating a rapid change in the battle situation." The recent German war reports also discussed the German-Italian counter-offensive, so the Libyan war can be divided into three stages: the first stage was the Axis offensive that began on May 26; the second stage was the British attempt to obstruct the German preparations, but it was not successful. If the progress of the Axis forces has entered the third stage, it is sufficient to prove that General Rommel was not hindered by the British and was able to launch the base of the third offensive. Therefore, the battle in the third stage is the encirclement and annihilation of a part of the British army. The number of prisoners captured by the Axis forces and the number of enemy artillery and tanks captured or destroyed is enough to demonstrate the extent of the German victory. The German communique made no allusions to the strategic objectives of the North African war, but one thing is certain: the British forces in North Africa have been weakened by the recent battles, which is of great importance to the future development of the war. The German war report specifically mentioned that the Axis powers have been able to transport a considerable amount of war materiel across the Mediterranean to North Africa because the continuous air strikes by the German and Italian air forces on Malta have made the island no longer available to the British military. Therefore, the safety of the Axis convoys transporting reinforcements to Africa and protecting the Mediterranean Sea is almost 100%. As for the British supply line to Africa, it must detour the long route around the Cape of Good Hope, because if it enters the Mediterranean, a large number of ships will inevitably be sunk.

Berlin, 8th (Reuters dispatch) - In the past few days, the German Air Force has been particularly active in North Africa. On Friday night, German planes bombed British motor units and barracks along the highway near Via Balbia, causing many casualties. On Saturday morning, German planes appeared again over Tobruk, bombing the docks and ships docked in the port. Subsequent reconnaissance confirmed that the port had suffered heavy losses, and the fires were still burning. German anti-aircraft guns have also repeatedly achieved results in North Africa. A certain artillery unit shot down two British planes on May 31, and the number of enemy planes shot down by them has now exceeded 100. Another German mobile anti-aircraft unit also shot down the 110th enemy aircraft on June 1. On Friday, the team destroyed five British tanks, bringing the total number of tanks destroyed by the unit to 320.

Rome, 8th (Havas News Agency dispatch) - The Italian High Command announced this morning that enemy forces in North Africa, with the assistance of armored units, launched a counter-attack yesterday, but were repelled by the Axis infantry. We captured 150 enemy soldiers and destroyed several armored vehicles and trucks. The commander of the 10th Indian Motorized Brigade was also among those captured. As a result of the air battle over Acroma, three enemy aircraft were shot down by Italian aircraft, with no losses on our side. German and Italian aircraft again attacked the naval and air bases of Malta. Several targets on the ground were hit by bombs and caused several fires. Last night, several British aircraft bombed Cagliari. Several buildings in the city center collapsed, killing 12 people and injuring 15.

Rome, 8th (Havas News Agency dispatch) - According to official sources, three Allied merchant ships have been sunk in the Mozambique Channel in North Africa.

### Six Months of the Pacific War; Japan Holds Celebrations

Tokyo, 8th (Domei News Agency dispatch) - Half a year has passed in an instant since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War. The people of Japan are welcoming the sixth day of the Imperial Rescript amid great victories with imaginable warmth and joy. The newspapers here on the 8th all published detailed reports on the great achievements they have achieved on the front page. In addition to praising the achievements of the Japanese army, their editorials were also filled with emotion. For example, the Asahi Shimbun stated that the progress of Japan's national fortune in the past half year is a world-historical creation. In addition to infinite gratitude for the outstanding achievements of the army and navy, the people are filled with emotion when recalling past events. From the cancellation of the Anglo-Japanese alliance to the Washington Conference, Japan's situation has been difficult in the past two decades. After the Manchurian and Sino-Japanese incidents, Britain and the United States abandoned trade treaties with Japan and froze Japanese funds. In such circumstances, Japan was like being in a siege on all sides. At this time, should we retreat and return to the old Japan of the construction era, or should we advance and seek a new Japan with all the qualities of a modern nation? We have fallen into a major divergence point. After the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, in just half a year, we have completed the occupation of vast areas unprecedented in history. The Sino-Japanese incident is still continuing, and we are at the same time at odds with the world's two major powers, so the future of this great war may be very distant. However, at the beginning of this war, our country's position has always been in a favorable situation, and the construction of the Co-Prosperity Sphere is proceeding steadily, so there is no doubt that the future of the war has gradually become brighter.

Tokyo, 8th (Reuters dispatch) - Taking advantage of the end of the six-month war against Britain and the United States, Japan is holding various celebrations across the country today. Japanese newspapers published the Imperial Headquarters' declaration of war on December 8, 1941, and Prime Minister Tōjō's speech. Several cabinet members will deliver radio speeches, stating the importance of this day.

Tokyo, 8th (Reuters dispatch) - It has been six months since Japan declared war on Britain and the United States. Yesterday, Japanese newspapers wrote articles reviewing the six months since the Japanese army's surprise attack on Pearl Harbor. After a short six months, a large part of the world map has also changed. The British fleet that once dominated the world and the American fleet that occupied the Pacific are now nowhere to be found. The Japanese army has reached all corners of East Asia, and Japan's belief in establishing the East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere and a new world order is becoming more and more firm. The Yomiuri Shimbun stated that Japan has been striving to avoid war in East Asia, but Britain and the United States have been contrary to Japan's wishes, so this war will inevitably be fought until Britain and the United States surrender.

### Indonesian Political Groups in Medan Disband

Medan, 8th (Domei News Agency dispatch) - The Indonesian political groups that have been actively involved in the national movement by resisting Dutch autocratic oppression honorably dissolved on the 7th, and will reorganize a new police guard corps under the guidance of the Japanese army from now on.

### Current Situation in Surabaya

Surabaya, 8th (Domei News Agency dispatch) - Half a year has passed since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War. Not only has the trace of the former Dutch rule been completely eradicated from the streets of Surabaya, a large city in eastern Java, but also the vigorous spirit of the new East Asia is emerging. The English and Dutch characters of the shops have long disappeared completely, and the names of stations and streets have also been completely changed to Malay and Japanese. The Arlong Street, the economic center of Surabaya, has been revived by the opening of banks such as Zhengjin, Taiwan, and Mitsui, and many other shops. In the factory area along the Boboranda River in the southeast of the city, various metal, food, and chemical raw material factories have also been fully restored, and the sound of machines roars all night long. Various large and small ships loaded with construction materials and agricultural products shuttle back and forth in Surabaya, and their number is increasing day by day. Therefore, the import and export trade of the entire port will soon be restored to its pre-war state.

### Japanese Army Completely Occupies Both Major Philippine Islands:  Moho Island and Silay Island

 Allied Press Telegram from a Certain Japanese Ship, 8th: The Japanese Navy operating in the Visayas Sea has completed mopping-up operations on Moho Island, the tenth largest island in the Philippines. The Japanese Navy cooperated with the Japanese Army, which landed on Negros Island on May 22nd, and attacked Moho Island on May 23rd. They immediately controlled the sea area near Tigbayuran on the southern coast of the island and occupied Kitawi on the northern coast. Remnants of the enemy forces in that port offered resistance, but the Japanese Navy completely occupied it, seizing four American military ships. In addition, they seized three enemy ships near Tigbayuran and intercepted an enemy ship discovered by a naval aircraft off the west coast of Cebu Island. Moho Island occupies 1,400 square miles, is rich in mineral resources, especially coal. Furthermore, the Japanese naval landing force suddenly landed on Silay Island at the southern tip of the Philippines on May 25th and quickly occupied it. The remaining enemy forces on the island were unaware that Lieutenant General Wainwright had surrendered at Corregidor. After the Japanese Navy landed, they fled into the mountains, but were captured and disarmed by the Japanese Army. Silay Island is known for its livestock and coconut copra.

 Allied Press Telegram from Tokyo, 8th: According to a telegram from a Japanese warship, the remnants of the American forces south of Zamboanga on Silay Island are disobeying Wainwright's surrender order. On the morning of May 25th, Japanese naval forces landed in Ipila and Lamitan without any resistance and immediately occupied the entire island. The American constabulary on the island, upon learning of the Japanese landing, immediately fled into the mountains, but were eventually captured and disarmed. Silay Island is strategically located and can defend the American army and air force naval ports of Zamboanga. It has long been used by the United States as a strategic base. The area is famous for its production of cattle and coconut embryo.

### German Socialist Party Launches Housing Campaign; Restrictions on Pharmaceutical Production

 Havas Telegram from Berlin, 7th: The Berlin correspondent of the Swedish "Dagens Nyheter" reported that the German authorities, in order to perfect the allocation of housing, intend to take various restrictive measures within days. At the same time, they also intend to restrict the production of pharmaceuticals. Currently, there is a severe shortage of housing in Germany. The country's labor bureau recently discussed this issue with local National Socialist Party leaders. As a result, it was decided to launch a national housing campaign. The method is to divide large apartment rooms or independent houses into two or three households in order to allow those without housing to live in them. Therefore, those who previously lived in large houses will have to move into small houses in the future. As for the pharmaceutical industry, the authorities, in view of the lack of coal last winter, have had considerable difficulties in this industry. They now intend to implement large-scale restrictions, stopping the manufacture of unnecessary drugs and focusing all efforts on producing essential drugs. Regarding the drugs to be banned, a committee composed of domestic physicians, chemists, and industrialists has compiled a catalog to inform their colleagues. All drugs prescribed by the state must now be manufactured in large quantities, including painkillers and drugs for treating fever and chills. In the past few weeks, some people have purchased large quantities of drugs. For the sake of equitable distribution, the authorities have decided to prohibit such bulk transactions.

Since 1939, our government has strictly adhered to neutrality, and the people of the country should be grateful for this move by the government. However, this year foreign aircraft have frequently violated our country's airspace, causing extreme indignation among the people. Although we love peace, we are unwilling to sacrifice freedom to gain peace. Our national defense has been greatly strengthened. The belligerent countries must respect our country's neutrality and sovereignty of its airspace. Up to now, although there is no way to prove that foreign aircraft flying over our individual airspace are malicious, if such incidents occur again, we will never tolerate them and will do our best to maintain our neutrality.

The committee has 30 members and is working with the support of the government and the Minister of Labor. Leader Laval appointed former Deputy Minister of Labor Pétain as chairman.

### Norway Discovers Secret Activities; Those Arrested Have Been Confined; Germany Also Cracks Down on Reactionaries

 Havas Telegram from Stockholm, 7th: According to an official announcement from Norway, the country's authorities recently discovered that some people in the country were engaged in reactionary political activities and published and distributed many secret newspapers. From the beginning to the middle of May, no less than 200 types of secret newspapers circulated. The government has arrested 23 people and sentenced them to imprisonment for up to four years. In addition, 200 of the 666 Norwegian teachers arrested last time were sent to the Soviet prisoner-of-war camp in northern Norway between April 12th and May 8th to be confined, working together with the prisoners of war to participate in the construction of national defense works and unloading ships, and receiving the same treatment.

### Fierce Siege Warfare Unfolds at Sevastopol Naval Port; German-Finnish Forces Prepare to Attack Murmansk

 Allied Press Telegram from Lisbon, 7th: The German army launched a fierce siege of the last Soviet stronghold in the Crimean Peninsula, the Sevastopol naval port. This news was confirmed by a United Press dispatch from the area to Moscow on the 7th. Although the German army stubbornly defended, it eventually faced a major crisis due to the heavy bombing by German aircraft.

 Havas Telegram from Bern, Switzerland, 8th: The German army has been besieging the Soviet port of Sevastopol in the Crimean region for 210 days. As some military observers predicted, the German army has launched another fierce offensive, the scale of which is comparable to the battles between last November and December. The purpose is to occupy this "Soviet thorn" in order to launch a major offensive east of the Kerch Peninsula. The German offensive began with air force bombing, and air battles are taking place day and night, but the Red Army's anti-aircraft fire is extremely fierce and naval aircraft are also very active. All the residents of Sevastopol Port are mobilized to defend the city, and the city's water and electricity supply has not been cut off.

 Haitong News Agency Telegram from the German Leader's Headquarters, 8th: This afternoon's military battle report stated that the enemy's most advanced attempts to invade the East European southern route were thwarted by the Hungarian army. On the central route, the enemy forces being surrounded continued to encounter attacks by our army. Although the weather was bad, our army's offensive spirit remained the same. In the Volkhov area, the enemy repeatedly launched fierce attacks, and our army firmly defended a bridgehead for a long time. The enemy suffered heavy losses and retreated in defeat.

 Haitong News Agency Telegram from Berlin, 8th: The Soviet army launched several fierce attacks on the German positions around Leningrad the day before yesterday, but eventually retreated with heavy losses due to the fierce fire from our side. In Volkhov, the Soviet army, after shelling for several hours, approached the positions strictly guarded by a German division. Our rapid descent bomber assisted the army in resisting the war and repelled the enemy. Several teams of Soviet troops surrounded in the rear of the central route, hiding in the forest, were firmly defended. The German army bravely pounced and broke through the enemy's positions, destroying several Soviet tanks. The German army built a bridgehead in the early morning and then expanded the construction of the fortress. Two large German corps fighting on other routes achieved contact with each other, forming a horn-like situation. The remaining Soviet troops hiding in the forest were completely annihilated. Several Soviet counterattacks were ineffective, and both manpower and material resources suffered heavy losses. Several teams of the German air force participated in the war and won a victory. The enemy forces trapped in heavy encirclement were bombarded by bombs and strafed by machine guns, suffering huge losses.

 Havas Telegram from Stockholm, 7th: The Eastern Front has remained relatively quiet in recent days. According to the Soviet Information Bureau's battle report last night, "For the past 24 hours, there have only been local skirmishes on the front line, apart from reconnaissance activities." The German battle report also stated that "There was only a slight battle in the central area. Several German infantry units advanced on the Red Army's strong positions in that area and immediately broke through its main line of defense, occupying 16 of the defense area. As for the areas of Kalinin and Moscow, the Red Army had several salient positions in the winter, which have now been eliminated by the German army, restoring the situation as of last November. In other words, the front line in that area has been straightened near Mozhaisk." As for the southern route, the Red Army attempted to recover a certain bridgehead on the Donets River, but was repelled by the German-Hungarian joint forces. The Red Army suffered heavy losses. Moscow announced that the Red Army in the south had attacked the German defense line in a certain place and killed 400 German soldiers. In addition, German aircraft in that area continued to bomb the Red Army positions and transportation lines, and several large ammunition depots were hit and exploded. As for the northern route, on the 3rd and 4th, the German army was consolidating its positions and clearing out Soviet guerrillas along the Leningrad-Shalsky and Novgorod-Lutsk railway lines. These guerrillas had infiltrated the German rear north of Novgorod last winter.

 Havas Telegram from Stockholm, 7th: It is reported that the German and Finnish allied forces carried out a small-scale raid near the Litsa River, which was very successful. The river is located about 35 miles west of the Murmansk port fortress.

### US Retail Goods Overview for April

 Havas Telegram from Washington, 7th: According to economic experts here, the quantity and value of US retail goods in April this year both decreased, which will be the same trend as the US wartime economy months ago. The retail index in April this year decreased by about 25% in total value compared with the same month last year. If measured by total quantity, it decreased by 20% compared with last year. However, the production of ordinary goods recently has not been completely stopped due to the war, so it is not accurate to say that daily necessities only rely on existing stocks. However, wartime economic policies have indeed made ordinary trade difficult. Since March of this year, the number of wholesale merchants and retail merchants has decreased. Although ordinary workers have lost their ordinary jobs, many have found other branches in military factories, so the income tax revenue in April still reached more than 800 million yuan.

### A Complete View of Australia (Part 2): A Comprehensive and Simple Narrative

Australia can be roughly divided into temperate and tropical zones, with the vast majority of the population and major cities located in the southern temperate zone. The tropical part accounts for one-third of the total area, 1,149,320 square miles, and includes desert, semi-desert, and forest areas. Uniquely, Australia's tropical region does not suffer from widespread tropical diseases. It is not only not "the white man's grave," but is also suitable for convalescence for patients with tuberculosis and lung diseases, as evidenced by the strong physique of the people in Northern Australia. The central region, difficult to place between the temperate and tropical zones, is hotter than Northern Australia due to its purely continental climate and lack of marine air regulation, similar to why the hottest part of Africa is not directly under the equator but in the Sahara Desert.

The best region of the Australian continent is undoubtedly the temperate zone, accounting for six-tenths of the total area, or 1,825,261 square miles. The climate here is similar to that of California in the United States, Southern France, and Italy. The most densely populated area is the 1,500-mile-long Murray River basin, which is most conducive to future development. Australia's temperate zone is best compared to California in the United States, but it is much larger in area. Both Australia and California were initially deemed unsuitable for colonization by early navigators, but the sudden discovery of gold mines led to an influx of adventurous pioneers, and they flourished. California has the Mojave Desert, and Australia also has deserts. The products of both regions are similar. California imported eucalyptus trees from Australia, and Australia imported pine trees from California, planting them everywhere to enhance the scenery. Australia also adopted California's dry farming and irrigation methods, while California adopted Australia's pest control methods.

Overall, due to its island status, Australia's climate is more temperate than other continents. The difference in temperature between the inland in summer and winter is at most 81 degrees, which is incomparable to North America's 153 degrees and Siberia's 171 degrees. When Europe and the Americas are in the dead of winter, Australia is bathed in sunshine. Generally, spring is in September, October, and November; summer is in December, January, and February; autumn is in March, April, and May; and winter is in June, July, and August. In winter, tourists can ski in the Alps, and within two days of traveling north, they can reach sun-drenched beaches and enjoy the pleasure of seaside bathing. The average annual sunshine hours in the capital cities of Australia's states are: Perth 2,827 hours, Brisbane 2,705 hours, Adelaide 2,535 hours, Sydney 2,472 hours, Melbourne 2,232 hours, and Hobart 2,118 hours. Approximately one million square miles of Australia receive 10 to 20 inches of rainfall annually, and another one million square miles receive 20 to 40 inches of rainfall annually.

Australia's industry is most important for its wool, the quality of which is the best in the world, with an annual output value of approximately £55 million, most of which is exported for sale. Australia's sheep account for less than one-sixth of the world's total, but its wool supply accounts for more than one-quarter of the world's needs, and Australia accounts for half of the world's high-quality Merino wool. Australia strives to improve sheep breeding, so in recent decades, the amount of wool produced per sheep has doubled. Now, each shearing yields approximately nine pounds of wool. Wool production between 1932 and 1933 reached 163 million pounds, setting a new record.

On May 1, 1788, Australia's first survey of sheep counted only 29 heads. In 1795, there were 862 heads. Three years later, there were 1,100,057 heads. By 1820, Australians had crossed the coastal mountains of New South Wales and began developing sheep farming, increasing the number to 1,560,000 heads. In 1860, there were 23,000,000 heads, and in 1891, it increased to 106,421,068 heads. The most recent survey found that the total number has exceeded 113,000,000 heads. Although Australia has many large-scale sheep farms, most sheep farms have fewer than 5,000 sheep, with an average of 1,157 heads. There are only 4,000 farm owners with more than 5,000 sheep. Australia's sheep farming industry is highly developed, but there are still vast areas available for expanding sheep farming.

Wheat is an important agricultural product of Australia. Between 1938 and 1939, the total area planted with wheat was 14,225,000 acres, producing 155,000,000 bushels, which can be exported in addition to meeting domestic needs. On average, approximately 110,000,000 bushels of wheat and flour are exported annually.

Raising cattle and horses is also a major industry in Australia. There are currently 1,750,000 horses and 13,100,000 cattle. Cattle farms occupy vast areas. There is a cattle farm in Northern Australia that occupies approximately 11,000 square miles, making it one of the largest in the world. Between 1938 and 1939, Australia exported 18,600,000 pounds of lamb and 27,200,000 pounds of beef. In addition, it regularly supplies large quantities of meat to the British Army and Navy.

### The Municipal Council Actively Takes Measures to Compile and Sell Goods Beyond the Limit. It Has Sent Staff to Investigate More Than 2,000 Stores, and More Than 400 Have Been Warned or Fined.

From January to the end of May of this year, a total of 20,620 investigations were carried out. A small number of cases were found to have violated criminal law and have been transferred to the police station for referral to the court.

### The Deaf School Principal Sneaks Away Because He Is In Love with a Woman Named Wang and Embezzled Public Funds, So He Flees

The Zhonghua Deaf School, affiliated with the Zhonghua Deaf Association on Rue Cardinal Mercier, recently had a love affair and the principal fled. According to a report by a Datong News Agency reporter, the situation is as follows:

Love Affair

The Zhonghua Deaf School on Rue Cardinal Mercier is sponsored by the Zhonghua Deaf Association. The school was originally headed by Sun Zuhui, who was from Hangzhou, Zhejiang. He suffered from deafness and dumbness. After taking office at the school, he was quite dedicated to deaf education. In early winter last year, Sun fell in love with Wang Xiuying, a deaf woman from Zhenjiang, and soon they lived together.

Embezzlement of Public Funds

However, Sun had already married a wife in Hangzhou. Before the war, his family was relatively well-off, but after the war, it became increasingly difficult. Sun had an older brother who was a Western doctor in the Shanghai West Public Society, and his income was also limited. In the past, Sun was able to remit some money home every month to support his family. After forming a small family, the economy became extremely strained, and he even embezzled public funds.

Sneaking Away

The school used to receive a monthly subsidy of 500 yuan from the school board, and this money was also embezzled for two months, totaling more than 2,300 yuan. After the school discovered this, they ordered him to provide a guarantor and repay the money in installments. Because Sun's matter had been exposed and he could not find a guarantor, he sneaked away. It is known that his lover, Wang Xiuying, also left Shanghai with him.

Donations in False Names

According to He Yu, a member of the Central Deaf Association, people's hearts are not ancient. Currently, there are non-deaf people posing as deaf people to solicit annual donations or funds from charitable people everywhere. There are also some unscrupulous deaf people who borrow the name of running a school to solicit donations from the public, and after getting the money, they completely divide it up and use it. If you conduct an on-site investigation, in addition to an empty office, there is nothing. It is hoped that all sectors of society will understand this kind of inside story and not be deceived.

### Huajia Foreign Firm Donates Baojia Expenses

He was injured in the head and sent to Guangci Hospital. Due to his serious injuries, he died at night. The police sent the body to the temporary mortuary. Yesterday, Wang Ren from Chen Hongji Construction Factory sent someone to claim the body on his behalf, prepared a coffin, and arranged for its burial. His family was transferred back to his hometown for burial.

### Memories of Old Travels

— Qian Ding

The calligrapher Qian Ding, also known as Zhujiu, is skilled in the arts, likes to travel widely, and has long been known in his time. His oil paintings of figures and landscapes, as well as Chinese landscape paintings, are all wonderfully made. He is well-educated, has a firm ambition, and is able to enjoy his work in any situation. When he was a professor at the Art Institute of Peking University, he often invited people to visit famous mountains and rivers during the holidays to appreciate the true spirit of nature and collect everything at the bottom of his pen. Therefore, his works are purely realistic, thick and vigorous, and different from the ordinary. Now, Mr. Qian lives in Shanghai, specializing in the arts. He usually talks about the joy of traveling and painting. Now, I have specially obtained some miscellaneous notes from his past travels and published them in this newspaper. The travel notes of a calligrapher have a unique style and are very different from ordinary travel notes. It is hoped that readers will pay attention to them. — Editor

Zhujiu has a passion for art, perseveres, is eager to travel, and enjoys wielding the brush. Now, due to the difficult situation of the times, he is living in Shanghai, but his mind travels and writes freely, and he still has the fun of a child. Occasionally, he achieves something. Friends often see him being asked to take it away. Now, someone has talked about travel matters and asked him to write about them for the enjoyment of his fellow enthusiasts. Now, I will not conceal my shallowness and will briefly describe the main points, and attach a few notes from past travels with my feelings to show the interest in painting, the relationship between travel, and how it is. However, in this situation, I know it is difficult to write coherently, so I ask the readers to correct me.

Introduction

Painting is a spatial art. All scenery and conditions in the world that can arouse feelings and aesthetic feelings can be used as subjects for painting. Painters choose these subjects to express their preferences, intentions, and interests, and thus create artistic beauty. However, what makes a painter achieve artistic beauty is not only that, but also the need to enrich his learning, broaden his knowledge, travel, and improve his body and mind. Historically, landscape painters who have created successful and immortal works have all had their own unique cultivation and insights. What they need is to place themselves in the midst of nature, engage in learning, make their souls transcend, broaden their minds, observe all phenomena, and cherish them in their hearts; then, inspire their emotions and express them in their paintings. The beauty of outstanding art is thus created. Furthermore, painters who excel in landscape painting often like to travel through mountains and rivers. Those who have a strong passion for travel often do not hesitate to travel long distances, break their straw sandals, cut through thorns, experience dangers and explore wonders, taking hardship as pleasure and hardship as sweetness. When they look up at the universe, swallow clouds and mountains, and cultivate their magnanimous spirit within, they can see the natural scenery completely. This is their joy, this is their satisfaction, which cannot be described in ordinary language or conveyed by pen and ink. The ancients said, "Read ten thousand books and travel ten thousand miles," meaning to broaden one's knowledge and expand one's actions in order to seek the way of unity, and also to seek the location of one's heart. And the painter's journey of ten thousand miles is certainly to paint the beautiful scenery, experience nature, enjoy the heart, and broaden the knowledge, but is it only about art? Is it also to seek to achieve art and advance to the Tao?

(1) Travel Notes of Qianshan

In the late autumn of the sixteenth year, I departed from the old capital and traveled to the eastern province. Upon arriving in Shenyang, I asked my friend Mr. Chen to visit Qianshan. Qianshan belongs to the Motianling Mountains and is one of the famous mountains in Liaoning. It is about 200 miles southeast of the provincial capital. Take the South Manchuria train to Lishan Station, hire a villager to guide you, and walk 40 miles to see Qianshan in sight. The beautiful peaks are stacked high in the clouds. After passing Qilingzi, we arrived at the foot of Qianshan. We entered the Wuliangguan Taoist Temple on the mountain. It was almost dusk, and the evening glow filled the sky. We knocked on the door and entered the temple. The Taoist priest came out to greet us and treated us very well. There was a Taoist priest patrolling the courtyard with a gun. After we had dinner, we asked him about the situation in the mountains. He said that bandits often appeared in the mountains between summer and autumn, so the temple was often on guard.

After chatting for a while, we went to bed. I woke up in the middle of the night and couldn't fall back asleep. The moonlight in front of the window was bright and round. I urged Mr. Chen to get up with me to watch the moon. An old Taoist priest got up before us and was walking in the courtyard. I immediately greeted him and learned that this old man was 63 years old, mentally healthy, and had a humble demeanor. We leaned against the railing, side by side, in the silence of all things, and had a long conversation under the moonlight. I felt refreshed and had a sense of transcendence. The old Taoist priest spoke with interest and was very informative. He said that many people today knowingly commit crimes and are always burdened by desires, unable to break free, resulting in spiritual dryness. People today also cannot be as simple as the ancients. Human affairs are becoming more and more complex. There are many ways to teach, but returning to truth is one. Those who have made achievements today have their innate abilities. If I am not as good as others, I should seek acquired cultivation to transform my essence and energy upward in order to obtain their spirit. He also said that he had been practicing Taoism here for 24 years. At that time, the mountains in front of the temple were densely forested, and tigers and leopards lived there. They could be seen entering and leaving the mountains at night. One year, a fierce tiger suddenly came and ran into the courtyard, biting and devouring half of the horses and donkeys. The Taoist priests in the temple were terrified. I stood in front of the door and did not move, watching it leave directly. Now the forests have gradually been cut down by people, and fierce beasts have disappeared. After talking for about an hour, we went back to our rooms to sleep. (To be continued)

### The Parricidal Brothers of the Zhou Family Will Be Executed by Hanging Tomorrow; Two Other Criminals Will Be Executed at the Same Time

After the Incident, criminals sentenced to death have been detained in prisons because there are no places to carry out the executions. This time, it has been decided that the criminals sentenced to death will be sent to the Nanshi Court for execution by hanging. Last week, three criminals convicted of murder in the course of looting were executed by hanging. This Wednesday (the 10th), the Special Zone prison will send two names to Nanshi for execution by hanging, including Xie Jinbiao and others, who were sentenced to death for robbery and murder. The other two were those that shocked the entire nation.

Parricidal Sons

The Zhou brothers, Zhou Qinji and Zhou Qinxiang, who dismembered the body to destroy the evidence. The victim in this case was Zhou Yongjie, a Ningbo native who lived at 228 1/2 Haig Road, the owner of the self-built residential Sheng Lu, who started his career by running a Western medicine business. The date of the incident was 1:00 a.m. on October 5, 1939, when his two sons, Qinji and Qinxiang, used electrical and chemical methods to murder their father. Then, they moved the body to the veranda and dismembered it with a knife and saw, and then covered it with sulfuric acid.

Attempt to Destroy Evidence

Although the plan was extremely secret, it was eventually discovered by the two rebellious sons' sister, Zhou Qinzhu, who reported it to the police station, which arrested the two rebellious sons. On October 20 of the same year, the first instance judgment sentenced each of them to death. The appeal was also rejected. After the case was finalized, they were detained in prison, waiting for execution, until now. It has now been decided that the execution by hanging will take place on the 10th of this month, and this parricidal case that shocked the entire nation will be completely concluded. Zhou Qinji is 27 years old and Zhou Qinxiang is 24 years old.

### Japanese Military Police Report: Action Squad Members Under Major General Dong Huimin Fully Exposed

According to a report from the Domei News Agency, the Japanese Military Police in Shanghai spent four days, from May 15th to 18th, arresting twelve individuals including Major General Dong Huimin, the leader of the Chongqing side's Hainan Line Action Squad. Dong was then taken to Wuxi to gather his subordinates stationed in the vicinity and persuade them to join the peace movement. This action squad was directly under the command of Dai Li of the Investigation and Statistics Bureau of the Chongqing Military Affairs Commission, and was organized by the Blue Shirts Society. They used the area near Wuxi as their base of operations, responsible for special warfare in the Hainan Line area, with their main tasks being assassination, sabotage, and arson. This time, due to the Japanese Military Police's report, the main force of the Chongqing's strategic forces has collapsed, which has a significant impact on the anti-Japanese front. Details of the number of people arrested, the seized arms, and the investigation process are listed below.

Seized Arms

Fifty-two rifles (1,278 rounds of ammunition), two automatic rifles (60 rounds of ammunition), forty pistols (150 rounds of ammunition), three boxes of ammunition, six landmines, fourteen fuses, twenty gunpowder lines, and fifty detonators.

Investigation Process

On March 10th, the Shanghai Military Police arrested Chen Chenmei, the leader of the Shanghai Working Team, and thirteen others in the Nanshi area and the two foreign concessions, destroying their organization. Since then, they have been working hard to investigate the case. Later, they received intelligence that Dong Huimin was hiding in Shanghai to avoid being captured by the Japanese army near Wuxi. Upon receiving the information, the military police immediately began an investigation and arrested Dong Huimin in the French Concession on the 18th.

Brief Biography of the Leader

Dong Huimin was from Wuxi. During the August 13th Incident, Zhang Fakui, the former front-line commander, Yang Hu, the Shanghai garrison commander, and Dai Li, the director of the Nanjing Intelligence Department, organized the Shanghai Special Operations Detachment, with Dong serving as a lieutenant adjutant. After the Chinese army withdrew to the west, Dong gathered the remaining troops near Wuxi and organized a guerrilla force, serving as the commander of the tenth detachment of the Loyal Patriotic Salvation Army. In the summer of the 17th year of the Republic [1928], he defeated the New Fourth Army's Mei Guangdi troops and was promoted to detachment commander. In November of the 17th year of the Republic [1928], he went to Chongqing, where Dai Li appointed him as the commander of the Hainan Line Action Squad with the rank of major general. In January of last year, he went to Chongqing again, received guidance from Dai Li, and returned to Wuxi after half a year. He then fled to Shanghai and was arrested.

Sabotage Incidents

At 3:56 AM on February 10th of the 29th year of the Republic [1940], an electric mine was used to destroy a freight train heading to Shanghai between Hushu Pass and Wangting. At 1:10 PM on May 16th of the same year, an electric mine was used to destroy a freight train heading to Nanjing between Hushu Pass and Wangting. At 4:30 AM on July 7th of the same year, an electric mine was used to destroy a train between Tianfu Temple and Anting. At 2:05 AM on August 18th of the same year, an electric mine was planted between Luoshe and Henglin, but it was discovered and the attempt failed. At 11:00 PM on December 10th of the same year, a freight train heading south was destroyed at Luoshe Henglin. At 1:30 AM on December 22nd of the same year, an electric mine was planted between Anting and Tianfu Temple, destroying a freight train. At 6:15 AM on January 6th of this year, an electric mine was used to destroy the sixth and seventh bridge markers between Wuxi and Yutangwan. At 1:20 AM on April 11th, the fifty-ninth bridge marker between East Wuxi and Wuxi was destroyed. As mentioned above, most of the sabotage incidents on the Hainan Line were carried out by this action squad.

Arrested Personnel

A total of 152 people participated in the peace movement. The main leaders included Major General Dong Huimin, commander of the action squad, Staff Officers Liu Zhenya, Wang Cheng, Zhou Songyi, Political Training Director Gu Han, Adjutants Wu Zhengzong, Yang Fang, Liu Kai, Lu Zifan, Quartermaster Director Zhu Hualiang, First Battalion Commander Gu Xiaohai, Second Battalion Commander Guo Yonghua, Third Battalion Commander You Jugeng, Fourth Battalion Commander Huang Shengyong, and Fifth Battalion Commander Wang Bingshan.

Dong Huimin's Statement

After being arrested, Dong Huimin and others realized the futility of resisting Japan and resolutely joined the peace movement. According to Dong's statement, since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, he has realized the contradictions of resisting Japan, especially the heartbreak of assassinating compatriots. He is extremely grateful for the kind treatment he received from the Japanese army after his arrest, and deeply regrets his past mistakes. He is willing to contribute loyally to the peace movement. The anti-Japanese front is filled with war-weariness, internal strife is rampant, and external aid has been cut off, which has dealt a fatal blow. Regarding the collection of stolen goods, Changzhu himself should bear all responsibility. Qualified people! Indicate that this move will draw out the original stolen goods from the pawnshops, without the need for redemption, and the stolen goods will be confiscated by the Jingshan Police Department and returned to the owners. The pawnshop owners will also be accused of receiving stolen goods.

Provide Guarantees

The main prevention measures in the new regulations stipulate that pawnshops can only accept pawned goods after providing a guarantor. The pawner and guarantor must report their names, addresses, and occupations, which must be recorded in the pawnshop's books. The official receipt must also clearly state the name, address, and occupation of the pawner. The new regulations also stipulate that the pawner must show the pawnshop staff their passport or other identification documents to verify the accuracy of the information reported. In addition, the regulations also stipulate that the pawnshop's business hours are from 7:00 AM to 10:00 PM. Pawnshops should clearly display the business hours.

### Street Alarm Bells Installed in the Central District of the Public Concession

Starting yesterday, red alarm bells are being installed on all roads in the central district of the Public Concession. This will allow for the immediate sounding of alarms in the event of an incident, so that nearby police officers and self-defense personnel can quickly provide assistance.

### Illegal Rice Shops Punished

The Shanghai Municipal Council's Information Office announced that the Taishan Rice Shop at No. 68 Henan Road was punished with the revocation of its business license for twice selling rice in violation of regulations, exceeding the prescribed quantity, as decided by the Council's Price Control Committee. However, it was allowed to pay a fine of 4,000 yuan in lieu of revocation. In addition, the Hesheng Rice Shop at No. 38 Avenue Edward VII was also punished with the revocation of its license for the same offense. However, considering that it was a first-time offense, it was allowed to pay a fine of 2,000 yuan in lieu of revocation. Hereafter, any rice shop found to have committed the above-mentioned violations will be severely punished. All rice shops must pay close attention to this.

### Zhang Lianfang Appointed as Director of the Poor Children's Craft Institute

The Shanghai Poor Children's Craft Institute was established last autumn and houses over one hundred orphans. This spring, after accommodating over two hundred stray children who could not be sent away from the city, the number of children increased sharply and the supply of food became difficult. A board meeting was held at the Atlantic Western Restaurant a few days ago. Over seventy directors attended, with Chairman Yuan Fudeng presiding over the meeting. He gave an opening speech, and the General Secretary, Mr. Cheng Zhiliang, reported on the income and expenditure accounts. The meeting then discussed issues such as funding and the re-election of the director. Zhang Lianfang was unanimously elected as the director. Mr. Zhang is currently the chairman of the Shanghai Changcheng Bank and the chairman of over five industry associations. He is usually enthusiastic about public welfare and is dedicated to charity. His reputation is well-known. His acceptance of the directorship of the institute is truly good news for the hundreds of orphans.

The quality is high, and it is different from the others. Orders are already pouring in.

### Guangcai Elementary and Middle School Expansion

The private Guangcai Middle School, with its affiliated elementary school section, on East Qiaojia Road in Nanshi has been in operation for many years and has gained a good reputation in the community. For the next semester, a new middle school building has been specially built. The location is spacious and can accommodate hundreds of people. The teachers are excellent, the management is strict, and the tuition fees are low. It is purely a pioneer in rescuing rural education. Especially at this time, it is especially rare.

Yesterday's newspaper was dispatched at 6:20 PM.

### French Police Department Strictly Prevents Theft and Directly Manages Pawnshops

According to the English-language North China Daily Mail, a reporter learned on the morning of the 8th that an estimated eight out of ten stolen goods in the past month were pawned at pawnshops.

Random Inspections

### The "Conte Verde" Ship Withdrawn to Japan to Replenish Food, Expected to Return to Shanghai Mid-Month

According to the English-language North China Daily Mail, the Italian ship "Conte Verde" was reflagged to Japanese on the evening of the 7th, ending its two-and-a-half-year stay in Shanghai. It sailed to Japan to replenish food and make other preparations so that American and Canadian nationals who want to withdraw can go to the former Eastern Africa. According to the Japanese Naval Office, the luxurious Italian liner is expected to return to Shanghai in mid-month. It will then evacuate refugees to Lourenco Marques. The ship will carry 650 passengers. Although Japanese and Swiss authorities said that the official evacuation list has not been compiled and several points are still under consideration, American nationals withdrawing from the interior are expected to arrive in Shanghai on the morning of the 8th. Countless Allied nationals have already arrived here from the interior or other coastal cities, waiting to evacuate.

### Travel Notes: From Shanghai to Taixian

— Ya Meng

I haven't left the concession for five years. Recently, there were important matters that required me to travel to Taixian in northern Jiangsu. I hurriedly made arrangements in the morning and was scheduled to depart in the evening. Because the decision was made too quickly, I felt somewhat uneasy.

This journey is now unfamiliar to me. To leave, the first thing is to prove my identity. Before the resident certificate was issued, I didn't dare to go back to get the return permit, fearing that I wouldn't be able to return. With the guidance of a friend, I obtained a "temporary pass" from the Public Works Department. After explaining the reason, filling out the application, and pressing my thumbprint (right hand), I obtained the pass. The procedure was very simple.

An employee of the East Asia Travel Agency said, "Although the night train from Shanghai to Nanjing departs at 10:30, there are frequent lockdown exercises in the concession. If you want to avoid being late for the train, it's best to leave earlier."

I was going to Zhenjiang first—the former capital of Jiangsu Province. The second-class ticket cost 11.8 yuan in military scrip. At 8:00 PM, I picked up my simple luggage and rushed to the Binshan Road intersection. I got off the bus, slowly walked into the military station building, took out my "temporary pass," and was subjected to a simple questioning by the Japanese sentry: "What do you do?" "I'm a businessman—" "Where are you going?" "Zhenjiang first..."

"Okay... you go."

I followed the crowd into a line that seemed to be squeezing rice. There were so many people, the noise was so loud, and the lights around were dim. I felt a little dizzy. From 9:00 to 10:00, and then second by second, until 10:15, the ticket inspector opened the low gate, and everyone entered in an orderly fashion. Because passengers were carrying huge bedding and messy furniture like chamber pots, they bumped into others, and everyone cursed, unwilling to give way at all.

The train was very long. The first things I saw were several first-class and observation cars. It seemed like there was only one second-class car. I didn't walk forward, so I couldn't be sure. Stepping into the second-class carriage, the bright electric lights illuminated everything. This first-class army vehicle was equipped exactly like a "Manchurian Railway second-class car, with rows of light-blue velvet cushions. I chose a seat and took a deep breath.

"I was pickpocketed. A wallet worth over 300 yuan was stolen..." A Chinese military officer stood opposite me, roaring, and put down his small bag.

"How were you pickpocketed?" I sympathized with his dejected expression.

"What division are you with?" An officer in the next seat asked. He seemed to have arrived before us and was now taking off his socks and scratching his feet. "You're a soldier, why are you mixing with the common people? Soldiers have their own entrance. Do you drink? So confused!"

"I do drink a little, but I wasn't drunk... Alas... a gold ring was also stolen." He rummaged through the pockets on his body, but to no avail.

"Do you have a certificate? Without a certificate, you can't ride for free. The conductor will make trouble."

"The certificate was also in the wallet... of course, it's all gone..."

"You should report to the conductor first..." A fat man in Western clothes was also speaking. "Hmm! Can this certificate be reissued?"

"You should go to the newspaper to declare it yourself. It's very troublesome. Who is your chief of staff?" The officer next door asked.

"The chief of staff is ×××..."

Over 300 yuan and a gold ring, isn't that almost a thousand dollars? What kind of bills were the banknotes?... Central

"They were all from the ×××× Bank."

Then everyone laughed.

The officer next door stared at his parcel, "How much is this georgette curtain worth?"

"It costs over a hundred dollars. Things are really expensive."

The atmosphere naturally eased down. The officer next door lay down, the fat man snored, and the pickpocketed officer's face was flushed, somewhat intoxicated. He took off his glasses and fell asleep leisurely on the chair.

The train departed on time at 10:30. The attendants in the carriage pulled down all the window curtains, and the scenery outside the window could not be seen, which was very depressing. When passing through Suzhou, I got off the train to take a walk in the misty moonlight. Looking at the dark ancient city in the distance, the evening wind was blowing tightly, and I felt quite cool. I returned to the carriage.

There was Japanese beer in the train, labeled "Cider" in English, costing 6 jiao in military scrip. It was very sweet to drink, and there were no other drinks available. At Wuxi Station, I bought two cakes for 1.5 yuan in military scrip. The taste was acceptable, but the portion was too small. I slept for a while in the sound of the train, and when I woke up it was 5:00 AM, and it was dawn when I arrived in Zhenjiang.

The teahouses outside the station were still there. I sat for a while and had a bowl of egg fried rice, costing 4.8 yuan. The cost of living is high. This is not a new thing here. I took a rickshaw to the riverside bus station for 3 yuan. The buildings in the concession area were completely destroyed by artillery fire. The broken walls and ruins were visible everywhere, and the roads were uneven. The ferry fare was 3 jiao in military scrip.

The boat set sail at 7:30. The weather was lightly rainy. Looking at the river scenery from the ship's deck, it revealed a magnificent landscape painting. The misty river water flowed endlessly, and Jinshan and Jiaoshan were all within sight. Three or five sails appeared and disappeared at the end of the water. At this time, although I couldn't talk about poetic inspiration, occasional feelings arise. "How many heroes have been washed away" truly made me have endless sighs!

At 8:00, I arrived at the Liuyi Station on the opposite bank of the river and took a public bus (costing 1.05 yuan in military scrip), arriving in Yangzhou at 8:50. After getting off the bus, I bought a ticket to Taixian (3.4 yuan in military scrip). The bus departed at 9:00 and arrived outside Taixian city at around 11:00 AM, ending the journey.

In the past, traveling from Zhenjiang to Taixian required taking a small train. Departing in the morning, after crossing the Yangtze River, it would turn into the Grand Canal. The winding water was clear, and the boat traveled very slowly, and it would only arrive at dusk. This time, it only took me four and a half hours to go from Zhenjiang to Taixian. This is worth reporting. On the section of the highway from Yangzhou to Taixian, there were several large bridges, the most famous of which was Wanfu Bridge. The bridge body was entirely made of cement and crossed the wide river surface (it takes three to five minutes for the car to travel on the bridge). It was straight as an arrow. Such long bridges are not common on the highways of Zhejiang and Hunan.

Also, on this section of the journey, the fields on both sides were a color of green and yellow. The yellow was the early-ripening barley, and the green was the newly transplanted rice seedlings. The farmers were working diligently, unaware of the passage of time. This is a common rural scene. As far as the eye could see, my heart was pounding, but I didn't know why. The small bridges and flowing water along the way, and the smiling miscellaneous flowers, made the scenery as beautiful as Jiangnan. After arriving in Taixian, I stayed in a hotel. An ordinary room cost 10 yuan. The electric light was dim, like a firefly. I spent 3 yuan to get a candle so that I could see my fingers in the room. After 10:00 PM, there were no pedestrians here. The cost of living has soared to the extreme, but the pancakes and fried dough sticks are very strong. This is also a somewhat satisfactory thing. (Thank you)

### Gold Purchases Disregarding High Prices, Spot Trading Breaks Through 23,000 Yuan

The black market for spot gold has seen an expanding price surge, with prices breaking through the 23,000 yuan mark. Investors are disregarding high prices to hoard gold, and the market sentiment is strong. However, transaction volume is scarce due to limited available assets. The market opened at 21,000 yuan, up 80 yuan from the previous day. Securities firms and the Tianjin gang were selling at 10,900 yuan. Cash firms and certain gangs were taking profits due to the large number of customers at their outlets, and certain gold firms and securities dealers were also listed as selling by the Tianjin gang. These efforts were insignificant, and prices gradually rose to 1,100 yuan. At 11:25 AM, the price was 22,000 yuan. The midday closing price was 21,900 yuan, a gain of 1,700 yuan compared to Saturday, with a high-low range of 1,100 yuan. After closing, the price rose as high as 22,500 yuan, which was 400 yuan higher than the previous high of 22,100 yuan on June 3rd. In the afternoon, the price started at 11,400 yuan and soared to a high of 23,000 yuan at exactly 4:00 PM. The selling price of gold jewelry in silver shops was raised by 300 yuan to 2,500 yuan (buying in reduced by 200 yuan). Refined silver was listed at 16 yuan, and the black market price was as high as 15 yuan. Silver coins were priced at 8.5 yuan each.

### US Dollar Notes at 30 Yuan

In the foreign exchange market, British and American gold pounds continued to rise to 546 yuan. US dollar notes also rose to 30 yuan. Hong Kong dollar notes continued to rise to 3.2 yuan. Military scrip remained at around 5.5 yuan.

The interbank lending rate of the Money Trade Association was 1.5 jiao. The discount rate for newly issued bills was the same as the rediscount rate, and external firms still had to pay a handling fee of 20 yuan per thousand yuan. Most transactions were at the same rate. The exchange rate of stored banknotes to legal tender was 2 yuan and 2.04 yuan.

### Banks and Money Shops Accepting Legal Tender

Slightly damaged banknotes will be accepted. Yesterday, all banks and money shops in the city began exchanging Central Reserve Bank notes at a rate of 2:1 for old legal tender. Signs stating "Accepting Old Legal Tender" were posted at the counters. The Provisional Joint Association of Silver and Money Industries issued a circular yesterday to various banks and money shops regarding whether or not to accept damaged old legal tender with place names, etc. The measures agreed upon are as follows:

Damaged old legal tender will generally not be accepted, but slightly damaged banknotes may be accepted on a case-by-case basis, such as "torn edges," "small holes in the banknote," "missing small corners," and "torn into two pieces that can be reattached but not completely split."

All Bank of Communications notes with place names from one province (Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui) and within the three provinces should be accepted.

All Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Central Bank notes with officially reprinted bank names and reprinted Shanghai place names should be accepted.

Banks and money shops with branches or offices in the city should handle the exchange at the same time.

### Bank Safe Deposit Box Rental Fees Changed to Central Reserve Bank Notes

Starting yesterday, the rental fees for safe deposit boxes in various Chinese-owned banks in the city will be uniformly charged in Central Reserve Bank notes at the original rental fee. In addition, the original deposit was 20 yuan in old currency. Recently, various banks have gradually changed the deposit for new customers to 100 yuan in Central Reserve Bank notes. The deposits for old customers will remain at the original amount and will not be increased.

### The Strength of Public Bond Purchases Is Astonishing, Such a Sharp Rise Is Rarely Seen

Yesterday, the black market for public bonds saw no selling transactions from forward contract holders, and prices continued to rise. Type C bonds rose above the 70 yuan mark, reaching a high of 77 yuan, while forward prices reached 74 yuan, the highest price since the August 13th Incident. Even before the August 13th Incident, such high prices were rare. Moreover, from April to May, over 80 million yuan worth of spot forward contracts were released. Despite this high level of pressure, the market not only did not suffer but instead increased, setting new high records. The strength of these purchases is astonishing. In addition to most of the purchases being made by the financial sector, a small portion was purchased by the general public. The strength faction's victory over the spot faction has become evident. It is now known that holding forward contracts is not as good as holding public bonds, which is not comparable to earning small profits. Fortunately, Tongsheng made a large number of purchases, and Defu made some sales. Lianhe and Xinji also made some repurchases. Xiangli and Tongkang made both purchases and sales. Rolling settlements also made sales. The main buyers were Shuntai and Qianyi. Datong, Hu Heji, Lemao, Tongyuan, Runli, Jiufeng, etc. also made many purchases. The prices of all bonds continued to rise, increasing by 0.9 to 1.7 yuan. The total transaction volume was approximately 2.56 million yuan. A simplified table is listed below:
Category | Highest | Lowest | Closing | Compared to Previous Day
---|---|---|---|---
Unified Jia | 38.00 | 37.00 | 37.70 | Up 1.7
Unified Yi | 36.70 | 35.50 | 36.00 | Up 1.2
Unified Bing | 37.00 | 35.00 | 35.80 | Up 1.50
Unified Ding | 33.20 | 31.20 | 31.80 | Up 0.9
Unified Wu | 34.80 | 32.50 | 32.90 | Up 0.90

New Asia (New) soared from $42 to $54, New Asia Science $34, Minyi $77.50, Great China Match rose to $190, New Capital Hotel around $118, Zhabei Waterworks $34, China Merchants Gas $33, Commercial Press $270, China $165, World (New) $100, etc.

### Double Horse Brand Yarn Prices Surge, Exceeding Spot Prices by $400-$500

The cotton yarn market continues to rise, with Double Horse brand yarn experiencing a particularly sharp surge, driven by enthusiastic speculation. As a result, price increases have exceeded spot yarn prices by as much as $500. 40-count Blue Melon is priced at $9,800 to $9,900, 42-count Buy Light at $9,200, 42-count Water Moon at $9,150, 20-count Water Moon at $5,550, 20-count Abundant Harvest at $5,500, 20-count Other at $5,250, 20-count Double Tiger at $5,450, 20-count Lyre at $5,230 to $5,500, 60-count Sunshine at $11,000, 20-count Double Horse at $5,400 to $5,500, 32-count Blue Phoenix at $8,600, 20-count Double Globe at $5,420, 42-count Golden City at $8,360, 16-count Red Kui Xing at $5,100, 10-count Red Qi Yi at $4,250, 10-count Boy Scout at $4,200 to $4,300, 10-count Red Double Horse at $4,200 to $4,350. 20-count Double Horse brand yarn, from its initial opening, surged to $5,600, then rose directly to $6,060. The closing price was $6,040, but off-market transactions reached as high as $6,100. The reason for this frenzied rise is likely the temporary delay in regulations, leading to renewed buying fervor.

### Cloth Prices Soar Along with Yarn

Yesterday, the cloth market saw prices surge in response to the soaring yarn prices, with various cloths continuing to rise. 16-pound Globe coarse cloth sold for $20, Flying Goose for $207, 9-pound Spring Character for $128, 8-pound Zhen for $124. 11-pound Globe fine cloth opened at $185 in the morning, later rising to $92, Great Peng $85, Fugui $80, Fugui fine twill $165. Compared to last week, fine cloth saw the most dramatic increase, rising by as much as $15 per bolt. Peach Blossom Lady's Linen opened at $291 in the morning and closed at $297 in the afternoon. In the afternoon, the market saw even stronger buying interest, pushing prices up to $305, a rise of $17 per bolt. Magnolia bleached cloth $190, Qin Liangyu $179, also rose by as much as $10. Longevity Palace silk $6.50, Volleyball $4.30, rose only 20 cents.

Eastern Cloth prices continued to rise, and the market was tight. 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth opened at $226 for new orders, then slightly retreated to $223. Due to the strong Double Horse yarn, buyers eagerly pushed the price up to $233 for the afternoon close, a rise of $14. Colorful Ball fine cloth $204, Flying Fish $96, Five Fortunes $8, Four Gentlemen beeped at $8.50 at the opening, retreated slightly to $8.30, closed at $8.60 in the afternoon. After the close, off-market bids reached $8.70, still in short supply.

### Grains Prosper in Tandem

The bean market presented a firm and rising trend yesterday. Green beans, due to limited supply and slow distribution, led to increased market sentiment, with prices seen rising by $3-5. Approximately 100 bags of Changzhou Cowhide Yellow were sold at a new price of $180, and 50 bags of Chongming Sand Silkworms at a new price of $87.

Corn, with some unloading of incoming goods, showed an initial rise followed by a leveling off, with results similar to those of [previous grains]. Two cars of Wuhu Zhen corn were sold at a new price of $99 to $98, and another car of incoming goods at $98.

Red sorghum was scarce in stock, and sellers held firm, leading to a firm and bullish market. Yesterday, one car of Kai Ming Guang red sorghum was sold at a new price of $83.

Soybean cake rose yesterday due to absorption by investors, with prices increasing by $2-3 compared to the previous day. 1,000 old warehouse receipts for Sixth Month Ji soybean cake were sold at a new price of $36, 1,500 old warehouse receipts for Seventh Month at $39.50, 2,000 new warehouse receipts for Fourth Month at $46, and 2,000 new warehouse receipts for Sixth Month at $47 to $47.60. 1,000 new warehouse receipts for Fifth Month Lizi soybean cake were sold at a new price of $44 to $45.

### New Shark Fin Prices

Shark fin has been in short supply for some time, leading to high market prices. With the currency system now changing, current market prices are now quoted in Central Reserve Bank Notes (CRB). Top Luzon King is priced at $9,000, Medium $4,250, Old King $4,000, Big King Conclusion $6,500 to $2,500, Clean Root Father $7,000, Chopped Clean Bird Hook $9,000, Whole Only $4,000, Small Only $2,900, Big Sand $6,500, Two Sands $5,000, Three Sands $4,000, Unified Sand $6,000, Top Pouch $6,000, Big Pouch $5,000, Sand Tail King Tip all $5,000, Sand Tip $4,000, Small Fin $1,000, East Tail $2,500, Black Sheep $1,000 to $250, Unified White Fin $6,000 to $4,250.

### Local White Sugar May Be Subject to Military Control

Jinjiang local white sugar has been in short supply for a long time. This type of sugar has a sweeter taste than foreign sugar, making it highly suitable for tea and food production. It is rumored that buyers have already shipped goods en route, but it is still difficult to predict whether they will arrive in Shanghai. It is also unknown whether they will be sold in other ports.

### Forsythia Regains Ground After Relaxation

Forsythia, after rebounding, briefly softened by $100 mid-route. However, due to extremely scarce supply and difficulty in meeting costs, it has resumed its upward trend, again reaching a high price of $1,200. Those in the trade who previously imported goods are still hesitant to sell, showing signs of tightening supply again.

### Cigarettes Soar Skyward

Cigarette prices have soared dramatically, with all brands breaking previous records yesterday. Various parties are mostly pulling in spot goods, with each pulling and the other pushing up prices, soaring skyward. Great Britain brand is priced at $18,000 per case in old currency, Old Knife brand $11,300, Pin Hai brand $8,200, Five China brand $6,500, Little Fairy brand $7,300, all rising by $600-700 to more than $1,000 compared to the weekend. Japanese cigarettes have also seen significant increases, with Golden Gun brand at $3,190, Golden Building brand $4,500, Red Rose brand $2,750, Quanlu brand $4,100, Guide brand $2,900, also increasing by $200-300. Domestic cigarettes Yushu brand $4,400, Beauty brand $6,800. Overall, the prices of all goods have risen significantly, with the possibility of further increases in the future.

### Galvanized Nail Prices High, Sales Scarce

The market price of galvanized nails has risen sharply in recent days, with each barrel of Bessemer steel selling for $1,200 in old currency (equivalent to $600 in Central Reserve Bank Notes). However, with such high prices, transactions are inevitably decreasing, and buyers feel hesitant to act. More sporadic retail customers are watching from the sidelines, making it difficult for the stagnant galvanized nail market to break through. Sales are ultimately sluggish. However, the stock of this item in the Shanghai market is very scarce, which is the only reason for the price increase. The market conditions for other hardware products are also similar, such as old and new leather at $5,000 per ton, No. 1 Bright Iron Sheet $13,000 per ton, No. 2 Bright Iron Sheet: $10,000, Old Oil Pond: Slab Stone Jinshan Pig Iron $3,000 per ton, Old Pig Iron $2,500 per ton, Scrap Iron Medium grade sold for $1,000.

Spring and Autumn

### Maintaining Appearances

— Fluctuations

We have explained everything. Now the situation seems different; to add another layer of clothing is too much for some to bear. Yet, "appearances" must be maintained. I have personally witnessed individuals keeping several brands of cigarettes in their cigarette cases, smoking different brands for different occasions to show their status. Or, for example, always riding first-class trams. Now that cars have disappeared, riding first-class seems even more prestigious. But most people cannot afford it, so they cautiously sneak into third-class, as if committing a crime. As for the trailer cars, even though the price is the same, they still disdain to step inside. Unfortunately, in Shanghai today, changes in cigarette prices and tram fares are happening in an instant. It is not easy to keep several different brands of cigarettes, and first and third classes on trams have already [unreadable characters], so you have no choice but to squeeze into the trailer.

The continuous rise in the cost of living has made one dollar worth only a few cents compared to before. Maintaining appearances is no longer about the difference between smoking cigarettes and riding trams. Yet, giving up that cigarette and squeezing into the trailer seems incredibly difficult. Shanghainese people will likely be forever weighed down by appearances.

### Price Increases and More – Should Receipts Be Issued for Dining Tax?

— Yi Qing

I remember seeing a cartoon on a certain gift, saying that the cost of living is like an airplane, flying higher and higher, while the salaried class is like a snail, no matter how hard it climbs, it can never reach the sky. This was just two or three months ago.

What about now? It can simply be said that the airplane has already flown into the clouds, and as for the snail, it is really unable to climb and collapses midway.

Just think: since the currency system changed, although price increases have been strictly prohibited, and all goods have been ordered to be priced in Central Reserve Bank Notes at half the price listed from the 26th to the 28th of last month, who is complying? Even the tram company is not paying in Central Reserve Bank Notes after doubling the original price?

Since trams have increased in price, the general salaried class who originally went home for lunch have to eat a quick meal in nearby small shops. For example, if someone lives in the West District and works in the East District, the round-trip fare is equivalent to "eating out." Moreover, the family has to consume more food at home.

If that were the case, it would be fine, but the "airplane" does not allow the "snail" to take a breath. Not only do all food shops not price in Central Reserve Bank Notes (with no discounts at all, or if there are, they are not [unreadable characters] an 85% discount), but they also "add one" to the small bill, and this "one" is a 10% dining tax.

Writing this, I want to talk about this "add one" by the way, not to say that we oppose the dining tax, but to question whether the restaurants are paying it to the Public Works Department as required? There are many points of suspicion: for example, most small shops do not have bills, or even ledgers; even if they have ledgers and bills, they do not have receipts for the dining tax...

Take me personally, for example, I eat out for lunch every day and pay a dining tax of 50 cents to one dollar every day, but I have never seen a so-called "dining tax" receipt. This is like the "refugee donations" of the past, where many were unknowingly cheated.

### Humor

— Zhong Yi

Old-fashioned Mr. Zhang can't avoid the word "money" every time he opens his mouth. A friend of his really couldn't stand him anymore, so one day he sincerely advised him with some great principles. Mr. Zhang happily replied, "Thank you for your advice. Indeed, your advice today is worth at least two hundred dollars!"

### In Biology Class

— Ning Ran

Before Darwin published his theory of evolution, French biologist Lamarck published a theory, namely, the theory of use and disuse. Today, we are discussing this theory in biology class. The teacher said, "The main point of Lamarck's theory is that acquired physical changes can be inherited by future generations, that is, he believed that acquired characteristics can be inherited. He explained how African giraffes developed long necks: the ancestors of giraffes were originally the same as ordinary deer, without long necks. Because they grew up in dry climates with a shortage of low grass, they had to raise their heads, stretch their necks, and stand on their front feet to find food on tall branches. Because they did this often, their necks became longer. Also, because acquired characteristics can be inherited, the necks of their descendants were longer than the previous generation. This continued for several generations, becoming the giraffes we see today." After the teacher finished speaking, a student stood up and said, "If this theory can be proven, then the descendants of so many people currently in all kinds of long queues are unimaginable!" This humorous example, when proposed, caused laughter throughout the classroom. Many, many thousands, millions of organisms gradually appeared before everyone's eyes, already flattened like plywood, and still squeezing desperately, seemingly not flat enough; on one side they were pulling, as if one arm wasn't long enough to be scary; while on the other side they were shrinking inward, as if their bodies weren't twisted enough. Terrifying! Therefore, the laughter suddenly stopped, and everyone was silent, lamenting the terrible descendants!

### The Day Tram Fares Increased

— Xin Meng

My colleague, Mr. D, teaches at a school quite far from his residence. He must take the tram to and from school. Therefore, every time tram fares increase, he always says that his expenses have increased again. This tram fare increase is clearly different from previous ones, with an increase of as much as three times. Before the increase, Mr. L had already received the news and told us that if the fare increase was implemented, he would decide to walk every day instead of taking the tram, unless it rained.

The tram fare increase was finally implemented on the 5th. Mr. L arrived at school that day earlier than usual. I looked at him with strange eyes and asked why he was here so early. He told me that tram fares had increased today. The round-trip fare used to be only 40 cents in old currency, but now it has increased to 60 cents in new currency, equivalent to 1.20 yuan in old currency. Teaching for one hour at school only earns 2 yuan in old currency. It's not worth spending so much money on tram fares, so the only way to deal with the fare increase is to walk.

Mr. L further told me that although the journey was long, he didn't find it tiring, and the time spent was less than an hour. He could use the early morning to exercise his body by walking and breathe fresh air, which might not be beneficial to his health. He also reported to us that there were unusually few people on the tram today, less than half of the usual number. Many people, like Mr. L, were using walking as a way to deal with the fare increase.

### Introducing the Student Bookstore Cooperative

Our cooperative was founded by several students to serve university and high school students. It aims to solve the difficulties students face in purchasing new books and is not for profit. The articles of association of our cooperative are now briefly disclosed as follows to clarify the truth.

Origin

Greetings. Recently, book prices have soared, due to both material and labor costs, and the suspension of printing by bookstores. However, bookworms have taken the opportunity to hoard and monopolize, adding fuel to the fire, which is not without reason. Although some are calling for the collection of books at high prices, customers often suffer from buying expensive and selling cheap. Students face difficulties in purchasing new books during this difficult autumn and must find alternative routes in used bookstores, but their high black market prices really make people panic. They exploit both buyers and sellers and profit from them. How can we bear to sit and wait to be slaughtered? Therefore, we feel the pain of being squeezed by bookstores and the urgent needs of students. Enthusiastic students from various schools have initiated the organization of the "Student Bookstore Cooperative," upholding the spirit of self-help and mutual aid, and are entirely at the service of students, regardless of cost. We hope that students will cooperate and support us, and we especially hope that people from society will give us guidance and work together to achieve this goal, which would be fortunate for students.

Purpose

1. To make the best use of books. 2. To save students labor and capital. 3. To organize student welfare programs. 4. To promote the spirit of self-help and mutual aid among students.

Methods

Students can register all kinds of books and magazines they need, whether Chinese or Western, and not limited to textbooks, by writing to our cooperative. Those who wish to give away or exchange books can also register in the same way, so that our cooperative can provide free introductions, so that everyone can get what they love and make the best use of books. Upright people from society who are genuinely sincere can also enjoy this service. When our cooperative purchases, transfers, or exchanges books, it will generally be done in the order of registration. Those who register first have priority to avoid confusion. Once our library is completed, all registered books for sale and exchange should be placed in the library for students and all sectors of society to consult and purchase. All expenses of our cooperative will be happily donated by students, so there is no charge for entrusting our cooperative to handle any matters. Our cooperative is currently temporarily located at No. 30, Chonghua New Village, Jing'an Temple Road. Student Bookstore Cooperative.

This time, the Public Concession's tram company, in addition to raising fares, also changed half of the third-class section to first-class. Getting on the bus on one side and getting off on the other side can definitely improve order. But it is difficult for those friends who only want to take half of the third class and are unwilling to run into the trailer. They think that the trailer is very noisy and that the front half of the third class is more orderly, so taking this half of the tram is not only economical, but also almost the same as first class, which is the smartest. But now smart people have no cheap goods to buy, and if they want to save money, they can only taste the trailer.

Because I heard Mr. L's report that the number of tram passengers has decreased a lot, I wanted to go out and see what was going on after school in the afternoon. Jing'an Temple is where trams are concentrated. In the past, people were crowded at the station all day long, waiting for the tram to arrive. Every time a tram arrived at the station, one group of passengers had not finished exiting, and another group was desperately trying to get on, afraid of not getting a seat or even not being able to get on. Today, the situation is really different. The number of passengers waiting at the station can be counted, and according to my statistics, it is less than 1/10th of usual.

On the way home, I heard many workers talking on the road. The material of their conversation was mostly about the military car's fare increase, which this time was more than three times. From now on, they won't even be able to afford to take the tram. As if unable to bear the burden, they can only deal with it by not taking the tram.

### A Laugh

— Fen

In these extraordinary times, everything should be simple. - We have carefully chosen (date) to hold our son's wedding reception at the International Hotel.

### Sharing the Same Boat Through Storms

— He Jia Zhi

(5) Retaliation

Fei Changhe's attitude was very difficult to bear. Wei Cheng just endured his anger and said, "Why do you want her to go back? According to what you're saying now, it's not a good reason. Don't listen to other people's rumors; let me ask her a few questions face-to-face." Wei Cheng was perfunctorily talking with Fei Changhe on the one hand and thinking on the other. He thought that even if he explained it to him, it wouldn't matter. Then he smiled and said, "If you have anything to say, tell me, and I'll go and tell Sister Cuizhen." Fei Changhe glared and said, "Hey! We're uncle and niece. I want to talk to her when she comes back!" Fei Changhe said "Ah," loudly and long, while glaring, stretching his neck, and standing up. A Yu watched from the side. Fei Changhe's expression was about to make Wei Cheng fall out with him, so he couldn't help but shout to A Xing and said, "Fei Changhe! What are you doing?" Fei Changhe said, "Bah! I'm talking to your master. It's not your turn to butt in!" A Xing clenched his fists, turned his face to look at Wei Cheng. Wei Cheng was still sitting and said, "A Xing, it's none of your business. Stand aside."

Fei Changhe came again with an "Ah"! It was loud and long again. Then, using the voice he used to deal with A Xing, he questioned Wei Cheng: "Cuizhen went to Shanghai. Who told her to go? Did you tell her to go, or did your aunt tell her to go? I'm her uncle. I wouldn't know what Shanghai is like. Shanghai is a big dye vat. How can a girl withstand being dipped in a dye vat?" Wei Cheng was also a little angry and said, "Fei Changhe, did you drink yellow soup today? How can you be so unreasonable? It was Sister Cuizhen's own wish to go to Shanghai." Fei Changhe said, "Who knows if it was her own wish to go or if someone forced her to go? I don't know anything now. All I know is that I want you to hand her over! Cuizhen was given to you. You let her go. What are you up to?" Fei Changhe seemed to be getting angrier and angrier, and he almost treated Wei Cheng like a deaf person, with his face right up to Wei Cheng's face. This made A Xing unable to endure it any longer. (97)

### Life Begins at Seventy

— Zhong Bai

Life begins at seventy! Is this sentence the pride of the elderly or the envy of the youth? I'm a little confused.

In a crowded third-class tram on the 19th Road, I saw an elderly man with white hair. He was holding a paper bag under his arm and a cane in his hand. No one would have expected him to be involved in stealing. When he was caught by the victim, he begged for forgiveness, saying that he had no choice. According to him, he was already seventy years old. When people heard he was seventy, they were unwilling to hit him again. However, he slapped himself twice in the face. The victim no longer pursued the matter and let him get off at Mud City Bridge.

The passengers in the tram all sighed and said in surprise, "It's a pity that he's still picking pockets at seventy!"

Everyone is groaning! Shouting! Appealing! Saying that life is impossible to continue. This incident is clear evidence. Clearly, both the elderly and the young are facing the same fate.

Life begins at seventy. If Confucius saw the above incident, he couldn't help but sigh and shed tears!

### Buy Low, Sell High. Buy High, Sell at a Loss

— Chuan Hua

The chairman of the Big Cake and Fried Dough Stick Industry Association secretly occupied the low-priced flour distributed by the authorities to each cake shop and sold it to various noodle restaurants at high prices. (As seen in recent newspapers)

On the other hand, there are also people who advertise, buying at high prices and selling at low prices.

It is true that those who buy at low prices and sell at high prices should be criticized, but those who buy at high prices and sell at low prices should be praised. However, they are now being criticized in the same way!

Why is that? Because buying low and selling high is a real thing; as for buying high and selling at a loss, it is a "skill" of market vendors, pretending to be kind and thinking that this will attract customers. This is like [unreadable word], how can it not be enraging!

To be low and high is good or evil. Hypocrisy is the greatest sin. Things in the world are often relative (such as good must have evil, truth must have falsehood...). This is further proof of this. (Charitable Scholarship Fund)
