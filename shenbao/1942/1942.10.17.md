Stockholm, 16th, Havas Agency Dispatch

Military observers here say that after the German forces occupied the Dzerzhinsky Tractor Plant in Stalingrad, the city's two major remaining resistance centers, namely the October Revolution Factory and the Red October Steel Plant, have both been surrounded by German troops. This puts the Red Army defending the city in an increasingly precarious position. It is reported from the Volga River that German troops have occupied another three-kilometer-long narrow strip of land. A dispatch from Berlin claims that the battle for Stalingrad has reached its final stage. However, the Soviet side has not confirmed the claim that German troops have occupied the Dzerzhinsky Tractor Plant, only admitting that the Red Army has retreated again in this industrial area. It has also announced that a large unit of the Red Army has crossed the Don River to strengthen pressure on the left flank of the German positions between the Don and Volga Rivers. As for the overall war situation, the Eastern Front is temporarily quiet. German bandits and special forces are fiercely attacking the Red Army's last stronghold in Stalingrad and are also advancing towards the Grozny oil fields. According to reports, on the morning of the 14th, under the cover of artillery fire and air strikes, German troops launched a fierce attack on the Red Army's resistance center, resulting in a 30-hour hand-to-hand combat. The German troops finally occupied the Dzerzhinsky Tractor Plant. This large factory, located in the northern part of Stalingrad and covering an area of two hectares, was the Soviet Union's largest factory for producing agricultural implements. After the outbreak of the German-Soviet War, it was converted into a military factory manufacturing tanks and armored vehicles, employing 20,000 workers. As for the German troops in the north, they are preparing to attack Murmansk Port, but the Red Army units guarding the Murmansk Railway are all Siberian troops, suitable for multi-season warfare.

As for Turkey's rights over the Dardanelles, they are perfectly legitimate and do not allow others to interfere.

### France Sends Laborers to Work in Germany

Geneva, 16th, Havas World Telegraph Agency Dispatch

According to Paris news, French Minister of Labor Threlatte has instructed supervisors in the occupied zone of France to expedite the conscription of workers to Germany in accordance with the agreement signed by Chief of Government Laval and German representative Schager. Any measures may be taken against workers sent to Germany and those who refuse to comply. According to reports, on the 4th of this month, the authorities issued a notice granting various benefits and subsidies of 1,000 francs to workers going to work in Germany in order to purchase equipment, clothing, and other supplies. This method has been very effective, but resistance has occurred in the Saint-Ãtienne and Lyon areas. Workers at a railway repair factory in Lyon went on strike in protest of the dispatch of 38 workers to Germany. Under the current French political system, strikes are not allowed. In the future, steps will be taken to ensure that all factories can continue to operate, but these steps are unrelated to the issue of sending workers to Germany and will be based on the laws prohibiting strikes and factory closures promulgated by the government after the signing of the armistice agreement. Furthermore, according to the Swiss newspaper, a strike broke out in Lyon yesterday morning that lasted only a few hours and was not very serious.

### Chilean President Cables to Postpone Visit; Roosevelt Sends Long Cable Urging Visit, Expressing Hope to Still Come to Washington for Frank Discussion; Ambassador Gen Visits Undersecretary of State Welles

Washington, 15th, Havas Agency Dispatch

Recently, Undersecretary of State Welles' criticism of Chile's neutral stance in a speech led to a sudden tension in relations between the United States and Chile. This matter has attracted much attention in recent days. Chilean President Rios' planned visit to the United States in the near future has been postponed due to this case, shocking the general public. Today, the State Department released the full text of President Roosevelt's reply cable as follows: To His Excellency President Rios, I am saddened to learn of your decision to postpone your visit to the United States, which prevents me from hearing your wise counsel in person. I was hoping to fulfill this wish on the day you visit our country, as I have always believed that it is very difficult for the heads of state to discuss thorny issues through correspondence, and that the way to solve all major problems is to sit down and talk frankly, as we Americans are accustomed to. That is why I am waiting for your visit so eagerly. I hope that your visit will only be postponed and not cancelled altogether. Furthermore, I had originally planned to visit your country in the fall of 1939, but due to the outbreak of World War II and the subsequent entry of our country into the war, I was unable to fulfill this long-standing wish. I humbly ask for your understanding, Roosevelt.

Lisbon, 16th, Havas Agency Dispatch

A dispatch from the Chilean capital states that the Chilean Cabinet unanimously agreed yesterday to President Rios' postponement of his visit to the US. The reasons for the postponement were notified to the Cabinet before the cabinet meeting.

Berlin, 15th, Havas Agency Dispatch

Chilean President Rios explained the postponement of his visit to Washington, stating that it was due to erroneous information, but expressed hope that the matter would be clarified soon. However, the Washington Post commented that Welles' speech was provocative, stating that recent events indicate that the United States' tolerance for the policies adopted by certain countries is extremely limited. This shows that Welles' attack on Chile and Argentina was not a slip of the tongue but was premeditated. Just imagine what the world would say if the Axis powers issued such insulting words to other countries.

Buenos Aires, 16th, Allied News Agency Dispatch

A dispatch from the capital from Washington to the "Clarin" newspaper states that the Argentine government has notified the Washington government of its unwillingness to sever diplomatic relations with the Axis countries. This was notified to US Assistant Secretary of State Welles by Argentine Ambassador to the US Espil, who recently returned to Washington from here. Espil further stated that Argentine public opinion is firmly opposed to severing relations with the Axis countries. It is also reported that Espil lodged a strong protest with Welles during his meeting with Welles regarding Welles' speech in Boston on October 8, which accused Argentina of harboring saboteurs who caused the sinking of Allied ships, and expressed displeasure in a veiled manner.

### Britain Probes Landing in France; Report That Allies Will Also Attack Dakar Port in West Africa

Istanbul, 15th, Havas Agency Dispatch

According to a dispatch from Berlin, in recent weeks, Britain has been conducting very small-scale military operations along the Normandy coast in occupied France. According to an official German announcement: (1) On September 7, the garrison on the island of Chausey was raided by British troops; (2) On the night of September 12, a French naval officer and several British officers attempted to land near Cherbourg Port, but failed, their boat capsized, and they were captured; (3) On the night of October 3, British troops attacked Sark Island. A German soldier was captured by the British and shackled. The German soldier protested and was brutally murdered by the British troops, so the German side took retaliatory action; (4) On October 7, a small boat carrying 15 British officers and soldiers attempted to land 15 kilometers northwest of Carentan in Normandy, but was repelled by German troops. In addition, in recent weeks, the British side has continued to conduct small-scale probing operations in Normandy. According to German sources, this may be because the British are under pressure from the Soviet Union and are preparing to carry out military operations to open a second front. Correspondents from Swiss newspapers stationed in London have questioned British authorities about this claim, but the British side has refused to comment. As for the rumors that the Allied powers will attack Dakar Port in French West Africa, the British side has also remained silent and has not commented.

An unspecified location in the United States, 15th, Havas Dispatch

According to Italian sources, the discovery of aircraft of unknown nationality in the airspace over Freetown, Sierra Leone, British West Africa, must have caused the British to feel unpleasantly surprised. It has been verified that the Italian submarine Barbarigo was operating in that sea area and sank an American cruiser. Axis submarines have even been active as far away as the Cape of Good Hope in South Africa. The reason for this will be announced later. Furthermore, the "Fascist Political System" newspaper has also published an editorial commenting on this, stating that the scope of reconnaissance aircraft activity is now unimaginable compared to a few years ago, so it plays an extremely important role in naval warfare. Most submarines now have aircraft on board for reconnaissance of enemy convoy routes. Not only that, but the visibility of new submarines is so great that they can not only follow the fastest ships across the Atlantic, but also overtake them. In addition, the self-defense techniques of submarines have gradually been perfected and have progressed from independent operations to group attacks.

### Naval Battle Near Lisbon Shakes Houses

Lisbon, 16th, Allied News Agency Dispatch

### Japan Completes Underwater Railway

Allied News Agency Local Dispatch The Japanese-language "Shanghai Mainichi" reported last night that since the underwater railway tunnel between Shimonoseki and Moji in Japan has been opened, the Central China Railway Company will begin selling through tickets to Tokyo and other places at stations in Central China, so that passengers will not have the trouble of purchasing train tickets separately in Japan. This convenience has been agreed upon by the Central China Railway Company and the Japanese government railway authorities in order to accelerate travel between Central China and Japan. It is expected that Japan's Fuji Express will travel directly from Tokyo to Nagasaki, passing through Shimonoseki via the underwater tunnel without stopping, shortening the journey by one hour. Passengers departing from Shanghai can thus wait in Nagasaki for one hour for the Fuji Express to depart from Nagasaki to Tokyo at 3:30 PM daily.

### Sugar Merchants' Cooperative Business Office Handles Registration and Rationing of Sugar, Limited Price of $4.43 Per Pound, Ample Supply, Strict Prohibition of Hoarding and Profiteering

The English "Greater Shanghai Evening Post" reported that registered retailers of the Shanghai Sugar Merchants' Cooperative Business Office will begin rationing sugar to the public from today (the 16th) at a rate of one pound per household per day, with a limited price of 80 cents in Japanese yen or $4.43 in reserve certificates.

Ample Supply

An official of the Sugar Merchants' Cooperative Business Office claimed that the reason for deciding on this step was to curb the hoarding activities of certain elements. The rumor that there is a shortage of sugar in the city is completely false. The sugar reserves are quite sufficient to meet the needs of the entire city, and new goods are arriving in Shanghai continuously. If the public encounters sugar being sold above the limited price, they should not buy it and immediately report it to assist the authorities in suppressing profiteering and hoarding.

Strict Prohibition of Profiteering

It is reported that there are indeed some people in the city who are worried about the lack of sugar, and speculators are trying to raise the price of sugar to more than $7 per pound in black market transactions. Regarding this point, officials stated this morning that they will take strict action against those engaged in black market transactions, as black market activities have been prohibited by the authorities. It is reported that the Shanghai Sugar Merchants' Cooperative Business Office has begun issuing wholesale permits to registered retailers, and the sugar prices required for their quantities must be paid by October 25.

### Police Department Rectifies Measurement Standards and Investigates Clothing Stores

The "Shanghai Times" reported that the Shanghai Municipal Council's Police Department will organize a special investigation team to investigate the sale of clothing in order to crack down on clothing stores selling clothing with substandard measurement standards, and will pay particular attention to whether the measurement standards are accurate. According to police officials, the authorities will soon order all major department stores and silk and woolen stores in the city to adopt standard measurement standards, and will begin investigating stores according to regulations. Store owners must strictly abide by the rules, and violators will be severely punished. The police took this action because they had received several reports of insufficient measurement standards in certain stores. For example, recently a certain person bought three and a half yards of wool from a large clothing store and handed it to a tailor to make clothes, only to discover that there was a shortage of about half a yard. He negotiated with the clothing store but to no avail, as he had not discovered the shortage when he bought the material. Therefore, the police have decided to rectify the situation in order to prevent this kind of thing from happening again, implement standard measurement standards, and send special police officers to inspect the stores at any time.

### From Book Collection to the Hongying Library's Grand Opening: The Library Houses 85,000 Volumes and Hopes Everyone Will Make Full Use of It

Special Interview by This Newspaper

Preserving books is a fundamental human instinct because the development of writing was originally intended to preserve thoughts and scholarship. Therefore, the concept of preserving written documents arose along with the invention of writing. Lao Tzu, as the historian in charge of the imperial archives, was responsible for preserving the books of the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors, marking the beginning of official book collections in our country. It is possible that book collecting existed before Lao Tzu's time, but there is no historical record to confirm this. Qin Shi Huang's burning of books and burying of scholars resulted in the destruction of book collections, but it seems that this was limited to private collections. The books preserved by the Qin Dynasty and the imperial historians were not burned. Therefore, after Emperor Gaozu of Han stabilized the country, he quickly ordered Chen Nong to collect the Qin Dynasty's books and records and widely encouraged the submission of books. He specially built the Lantai Stone Chamber to house them. During the Tang Dynasty, there was the Jixian Institute. During the Song Dynasty, there was the Chongwen Institute. The imperial collections of the Yuan and Ming Dynasties were also extensive. Emperor Gaozong of the Qing Dynasty was eager to excel in everything. Since his military achievements were already complete, how could his cultural achievements be lacking? Therefore, he compiled the Siku Quanshu and built the Seven Pavilions, whose grandeur was unparalleled in ancient times.

The above is the history of official book collections. As for private book collections, their origins were likely very ancient, but their development was relatively slow. In the postscript to Jin Shi Lu (Record of Metal and Stone), Li Qingzhao described how she and her husband devoted themselves to collecting books. This suggests the trend of book collecting among scholar-officials during the Song Dynasty. Song Lian wrote in the "Preface to Sending Dongyang Masheng" that "when I was young, I loved learning, but my family was poor and could not afford to buy books. I would borrow them from families with book collections and copy them by hand, returning them after a set number of days." From this, we can see Song Lian's frustration, which must have been common among scholars at the time. By the Qing Dynasty, private book collecting had greatly flourished. The so-called "Four Great Collectors of the Realm" and the so-called "Nan Qu (Changshu Tieqin Tongjianlou)" and "Bei Yang (Liaocheng Haiyuange)" were competing at the same time. In terms of both refinement and wealth, the Yang family was certainly superior. After Huang Yaopu's Shiliju was merged with it, there were no fewer than five hundred copies of fine Song and Yuan Dynasty editions alone, and countless rare books.

Book collections have three major disasters: war, fire, and dispersal. During Zhang Zongchang's rule in Shandong, Haiyuange was also occupied by troops. Some soldiers even tore up the Song Dynasty edition of Liu Zongyuan's collected works to use as gun cleaning cloths, which is truly lamentable. Dispersal is mostly due to unworthy descendants. Qian Zunwang wrote in the "Reading and Seeking Records" that after Zhao Qingchang died, his descendants sold his books in the mountains of Wukang, and ghosts cried in broad daylight. Whether or not the ghosts cried is unknown, but it is extremely painful for the hard work of the predecessors to be scattered by future generations. In 1932, a reporter traveled to Beiping and stopped in Jinan on the way back to visit Haiyuange. After admiring it, he had a half-day conversation with the owner, imagining that the descendants of Yang Yizeng would be very scholarly. Who knew that upon meeting him, he not only spoke vulgarly, but also exuded an air of decline. The reporter was stunned and determined that the fate of the Yang family's collection was in jeopardy. Sure enough, not long after, several blue-eyed, yellow-haired brokers mingled with him, and all the Song Dynasty rare editions were taken overseas. After this incident occurred, the cultural community predictably raised a great outcry, but it was only an outcry. How to remedy the situation was not mentioned.

In the past, whether it was official or private book collections, there was one major flaw: the purpose was only to preserve, not to fully utilize. Since the rise of library science, this problem has gradually been corrected. However, in our country, it has never been fully developed. A metropolis like Shanghai does not even have a public library. The libraries of some schools are so poorly equipped that the academic atmosphere is therefore stifled. This is probably the main reason. Yesterday, I read a report that the Hongying Library has opened. The reporter was already familiar with the library and will briefly introduce its contents below. The library has 85,000 volumes and over 700 charts and diagrams. This is certainly not considered rich, but it has a unique feature that is not found elsewhere. The library preserves 49 kinds of newspapers, mostly complete from the late Qing Dynasty to the present. Based on these newspapers, historical materials are compiled into nine categories: diplomacy, finance, military affairs, law, education, industry, transportation, and academics, totaling 1,000,003 items. In addition, 455 kinds of magazines and supplements are selected, and abstracts are compiled into indexes, categorized, totaling 152,000 items. This is a difficult task, but the contribution to the academic community is extremely significant. The reporter often has this feeling: Specialized experts throughout history, both in China and abroad, often spend their entire lives on one type of scholarship. If the efforts they put into collecting, reviewing, arranging, and comparing materials are analyzed, it is clear that the effort spent on this stage far exceeds the effort spent on theoretical exploration and judgment. If someone were to collect, review, arrange, and compare the necessary materials in advance, then scholars could save most of their energy and devote it to researching the topic at hand. This would surely help them achieve further success. The precision of Western almanacs and the detail of encyclopedias are indeed due to the help of these types of workers.

Finally, the reporter reiterates that the opening of the Hongying Library is a good place for book lovers and a reference library for the academic community. May everyone make full use of it.

### Academic Lectures and Notes

The Sixty-eighth Lecture of the Rongwu Sutra Society: Mr. Zhao Ximing lectured on the self-deception of Jesus, connecting it to the explanation of the common customs of self-conceit, arrogance, megalomania, and haughtiness. He demonstrated the self-evidence, including self-examination, self-reproach, self-renewal, and self-clarification. He also presented the virtues of Zengzi of the Confucian school, including self-reflection, self-examination, self-governance, and self-knowledge. He then explained that the ultimate goal of manifesting virtue, loving the people, and achieving perfection is rooted in self-cultivation. The Sixty-ninth Lecture: Mr. Shen Juexue lectured on a glimpse of the Analects.

The Eight Elders Academic Lecture, originally scheduled for October 11th, has been postponed to October 18th at 10:00 a.m. due to special circumstances. It will still be held at the Buddhist Jingye Society on Hart Road. Mr. Ding Fubao will give a lecture entitled "A Poor Boy with No Means," a novel title that is sure to contain many profound principles. The originally hired lecturer, Mr. Tang Wenzhi, is unavailable on that day, so the lecture on the origin of Wang Yangming's philosophy will be postponed to the next session.

### Shanghai Horse Racing Suspended

According to yesterday's announcement by the authorities, horse racing at the Shanghai Race Club will be postponed indefinitely because all enemy nationals are prohibited from entering the racecourse. The Race Club needs time to develop a new plan to issue racing permits to jockeys of Axis or neutral nationalities. The club announced yesterday that no races will be held during the current reorganization. It will issue another notice once the reorganization is complete. However, it is understood that the new plan is being drafted quickly so that racing can be resumed as soon as possible. Jockeys of non-enemy nationalities can still go to the racecourse every morning to practice as usual.

### News About Feikuai Tricycle Company

Local business tycoons Gao Ning, Chai Bandai, and Wu Boqin, in view of the shortage of cars and domestic vehicles for transportation, have organized the China Feikuai Tricycle Passenger Car Company with a planned capital of one million yuan. In addition to the promoters subscribing for shares themselves, there has been a very enthusiastic response from outsiders. It is understood that the company's preparatory office is now located at 89 Fuzhou Road, and the share payments are collected by Jin Cheng Bank. Once the preparations are complete, the company will officially open.

### Letter

To the Editor: We are writing to you regarding a news item published on the local news page of your newspaper on the 9th of this month concerning the closure of the epidemic department of the Shanghai Epidemic Hospital. The item stated that the hospital admitted a total of 6,051 patients with true cholera from July 1st to October 7th. This does not match the facts. According to the records of the Bureau of Health of this council, the hospital only admitted 651 cholera patients from July 1st to October 7th, not 6,051. We are writing to you to request that you check and correct this information. Sincerely, The Information Office of the Shanghai Municipal Council, October 16th.

The Vita-Fu team will send its sharpest players, including renowned players such as Wang Weizhen and Wang Yinlan. The main event will be Xingren vs. Russian emigrants.

Business News

### The Wind of Rising Culture Stocks Should Push Zhonghua and Commercial Press

Yesterday's Chinese stock market saw old and new stocks rise and fall in opposite directions. Old stocks with outstanding credit are more easily favored by buyers, and their upward trend is easier to start and sharper. Those who are searching for them find it difficult to find sellers to match. However, the holders of the new stocks that have recently appeared mostly harbor the idea of selling at high profits. The difference in the views of the industry is a normal phenomenon. Among the cultural industries, the Zhonghua Book Company's stock still had the strongest rising trend. Amid a wave of buying, it flew from 240 yuan to a new high price of 250 yuan on the same day, an unusual increase of 17.5 yuan compared to the previous day. It has been rising steadily for 32 days (excluding Sundays and holidays), which is a long time. Compared to 150 yuan on September 5th, it has risen by a huge 100 yuan. The Commercial Press also reached a high of 340 yuan as the final transaction price, up 10 yuan. It has also been rising steadily for 33 days, with a total increase of 80 yuan compared to 260 yuan on September 4th. The World Book Company only rose by 0.5 yuan. The rising wind of the Great China Match Company has subsided, lingering between 220 yuan and 225 yuan. Nanyang Tobacco was sold off at 110 yuan, down 1 yuan. Among the public utilities, the buying of Zhabei Water and Electricity has seen profit-taking since it was secretly stabilized the day before, retreating to 40 yuan and 7.5 cents. Chinese Electrical Company remained stable. Department store stocks were also mostly soft. Xin Xin Chinese Goods Store slightly decreased by 0.5 yuan to 1 yuan. Wing On alone rose by 0.5 yuan. Among the textile industries, Wing On slightly rose by 35 yuan. China Underwear continued to be fueled by buying news, but since the factory's loss of control, it has been difficult to arouse the enthusiasm of investors. The price is only slightly higher, as those seeking to sell depress it. It only continued to rise by 2.5 cents to 33.25 yuan. Great China Weaving retreated to 12 yuan and was difficult to sell, only 11.75 yuan. Fuchang and Shanghai Cotton Weaving each fell by a small 2.5 cents. Xinfeng Dyeing was 22.5 yuan lower. Hongsheng Weaving was 12.25 yuan, which was a flat price. The new medicine industry was the most stagnant, with only the China-France Pharmacy dropping by 0.5 yuan. The remaining, such as New Asia, Minyi, and Sino-Western, all saw flat transactions. The prices are listed below:

Stock Name Highest Lowest

Zhonghua Book Company 250.00 232.50

Commercial Press 340.00 330.00

World Book Company 72.00 70.00

China United Film 38.00 36.25

Nanyang Tobacco 112.00 107.50

Zhabei Water and Electricity 41.25 40.00

Chinese Electrical Company 33.00 32.00

Public Trust Electric 12.00 11.50

Wing On Company 32.00 29.00

The second compilation of the Chinese Stock Special, published by the Chinese Stock Daily, No. 613, 8th Floor, Stock Exchange Building, is even richer in content than the first compilation published in mid-July. It includes almost all newly established companies and is a good reference book for investors. The first edition of 5,000 copies has already been sold out, and the second edition is being rushed to print and will be released today. The actual selling price is 15 yuan per copy.

### Government Bonds: Low First, High Later

The over-the-counter trading of government bonds was relatively light. The market situation was low first and high later, with a difference of more than two yuan. Category D remained high at 60 yuan. Category A bonds had the least trading and were slightly sluggish in price. The sentiment remained very firm. The prices of the various bonds were extremely chaotic. For example, the final price of Category C was 4.1 yuan, and Category E was 1.4 yuan. However, because the gathering did not disperse, Category C was later traded at 4.8 yuan, and even 5.1 yuan. Category E was traded at 2 yuan. As the over-the-counter trading often does not end until 11:00 p.m., it is difficult to determine the final price. Here are the final prices for now: Category A is 3.2 yuan, but difficult to buy; Category B is 3 yuan, also difficult to obtain; Category C is 4.8 yuan, but a small price was traded at 2.8 yuan, and a high price was traded at 5.1 yuan; Category D is 60.7 yuan; Category E is 2.1 yuan. The total turnover was about 2 million yuan.

### Decoration Gold Market Situation Is Stable

Yesterday, the Shanghai Gold Shop Industry, Dashin and other peers, the retail price of gold jewelry per tael was still listed at 2,450 yuan, unchanged (purchase price reduced by about 300 yuan). The inter-industry price was first high and then returned to stable. In the morning, it was 2,250 yuan. As buyers continued to enter the market, it rose to 2,270 yuan, but sellers appeared, causing it to fall by 30 yuan to 2,240 yuan. At noon, it was 2,245 yuan, the same as the previous day's price, with a high and low of 30 yuan. It was still not easy to buy at the final price of 2,255 yuan. The number of transactions was low. The listed price of ornamental silver per tael was still 14 yuan. The inter-industry price was 12.8 yuan and 13 yuan as the purchase and sale prices.

The interbank lending rate of the Money Industry Association remained unchanged at 1.4 cents.

The Japanese military notes became stable again. The inter-industry price was 5.555 yuan. Silver shops and small money changers sold them at 5.56 yuan and bought them at 5.54 yuan or 5.55 yuan.

### Cotton Cloth Gradually Shows Signs of Rising

Factory Cloth

Yesterday, affected by the continued rise in raw yarn and eastern cloth, customers and peers in this street were quite keen to buy. The morning saw a slight rise, and the afternoon saw a surge in buyers, with a consistent increase in prices. Coarse and fine cloths rose sharply by 2.5 yuan to 3 yuan per piece. In addition, 16-pound Earth brand coarse cloth was 195 yuan, 193.5 yuan for Attitude Bee, 192 yuan for Flying Swan, 112.5 yuan for 9-pound New Character, 109 yuan for 8-pound Zhenzhong, 166.5 yuan for 12-pound Political Consultative Conference fine cloth, 162 yuan for Dapeng, 157.5 yuan for Fugui, and 153 yuan for Banking. Tricotine was 6 yuan, Peach Lady Forest was 254 yuan, Chick was 247.5 yuan, and Meiting was 244 yuan.

Eastern Cloth

Yesterday, due to the holiday of foreign firms, the confidence of peers was particularly strong. The supply was low and the demand was high, and the market gradually rose. The noon closing price of 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth New New list was 176.5 yuan, a further increase of 3 yuan. Banking's Dragon Head was particularly tight, rising to 168.25 yuan. Rainbow Ball was 167.25 yuan, Flying Fish was 166 yuan, Yang Suzhu was 165 yuan, Trumpet was 164 yuan, Five Fortunes was 164 yuan, Baby Diagonal was 157.5 yuan, and Four Gentlemen Tricotine Red List rose from 7.05 yuan to 7.1325 yuan.

### Business Briefs

Hainan Dried Longan Continues to Tighten

New Hainan dried longan, due to rumors of scarce sources, the market atmosphere has tightened again. Shops in the southern market are offering more than two hundred pieces of goods, which are still bright red, with slight variations up and down around 30 yuan. Compared to the previous market, the price has increased by one-tenth. Several dozen pieces of Shimashi goods arrived the day before yesterday, and the price is also looking good.

Shuidong Branches See New High Prices

High-quality Shuidong branches were offered in the past two days, and the shop's goods have already been opened. Although the initial market price was tight, the market price rose by several tens of yuan yesterday, reaching unprecedented new highs. There are rumors that there will be a temporary shortage of goods later, so the trend is even stronger.

Cigarette Market Momentum is Firm and High

The hoarding of ordinary goods has not weakened, and high-quality goods are all stable. Japanese cigarettes are also stable due to upcoming distribution. The state of the national cigarette market is not quiet due to the distribution of the Chinese Merchant Tobacco Association, so the price is flat. Great Britain Brand is 8,650 yuan, Old Blade Brand is 7,150 yuan, Pinhai Brand is 6,950 yuan, Fairy Brand is 6,300 yuan, Wuhua Brand is 6,350 yuan. Japanese cigarettes: Golden Spear Brand is 3,050 yuan, Golden Building is 3,300 yuan, Red Rose is 2,580 yuan, Quanlu Brand is 3,350 yuan, Nianzhi is 2,950 yuan, Compass Brand is 2,850 yuan, Double Axe is 3,400 yuan. National cigarettes: Pyramid is 5,300 yuan, Beauty Brand is 4,700 yuan, Golden Mouse Brand is 3,300 yuan, White Golden Dragon is 3,200 yuan, Golden Dragon is 2,950 yuan, considered slightly quiet.

Grains and Cereals Particularly Idle

Each type of goods is rarely traded due to the rare supply shortage. Only 500 pieces of Changji soybean cakes were traded at a price of 65.5 yuan, and one cart of Yuanlong soybean cakes was traded at a price of 66 yuan.

Tinplate from Huisi Society is Scarce

The genuine tinplate on the market has long been exhausted, and tinplate from Huisi Society is also quite scarce. Therefore, general factories are changing to use copper-plated tinplate from Huisi Society, copper-plated double-linked iron strips, and even black iron blanks (i.e., tinplate blanks) to maintain production. Yesterday, a can factory on this street purchased 200 boxes of copper-plated tinplate from Huisi Society from fellow businesses. The holders of the goods are thinking cautiously and firmly, and the market price is 1,600 yuan per box.

Woolens are Quiet in Both Wholesale and Retail

Wholesale is limited due to the limited actual sales to customers, and hoarders have long stopped hoarding. Retail is delayed because the price limit has been reduced by another 2%, and buyers are delaying in hopes that the price will be even lower, resulting in sluggish wholesale and retail sales. Yesterday, Yinfeng Caishen Huada woolen cloth was sold at 185 yuan per yard wholesale, Yuan Zhigong woolen cloth was 205 yuan, Yongxing No. 10,000 was 200 yuan, and Meifeng overcoat woolen cloth was still quoted at 262.5 yuan.

Yuanbao Brand Raincloth Sells Well

The rainproof cloth produced by Baofeng Factory has been selling well since its release. Recently, the autumn rains have been continuous, so the demand on this street is even more enthusiastic. The current market price is 22 yuan per yard for men's colors and 21 yuan per yard for women's colors.

### A Tale of Complete and Deficient Melodies (Part 1)

â Li Yunzhi

From the Evolution of Kunqiang and Yiyang to the Script of "Selling the Horse"

The rise and fall of various operas cannot escape the principle of the survival of the fittest. The distinction between good and bad does not necessarily lie in its own merits, but is based on whether it suits the needs of the public. This is the crux of why Peking opera is prevalent everywhere, while Kunqu opera is gradually declining. Although I deeply admire Kunqu opera, I cannot deny the ironclad facts.

To trace the origin of Kunqu opera, it is said that during the Jiajing period of the Ming Dynasty, Wei Liangfu of Taicang transformed the original Yiyang and Haiyan melodies into Shuimo melodies, which were later renamed Kunqiang. From this, it can be seen that the popularity of Yiyang and other melodies was earlier than Kunqu opera. Currently, Kunqu opera is showing signs of decline, and Yiyang opera has even less of a foothold. However, there are still opportunities in the pear garden for us to hear one or two fragments, indicating that most of them have been eliminated, while a small portion of the essence is still left behind.

For example, Chuichè was originally a type of Yiyang melody. Many Chuichè operas have long been mixed into Kunqu opera, so there is a term "Kunqiang and Yiyang combined." Later, Peking opera rose, because it is essentially a hodgepodge that encompasses everything, and Chuichè operas inevitably threw themselves into its embrace. Although both Kunqu opera and Peking opera refer to Yiyang melody as Chuichè and subordinate it to their ranks, it is fortunate that it has not been completely eliminated.

### Review of the Grand Circus

â Xiao Ma

I have watched the Grand Circus several times, and each time I am captivated by its emotions and do not feel bored. Shangyi (Shanghai Art Theater) has indeed undergone a new atmosphere. For a year, Shanghai's theater scene has been filled with family dramas, love dramas, and other similar plays. However, Shangyi is staging the Grand Circus, a fully socialized play.

In terms of directing, we can fully trust Mr. Zuo Lin to not handle the play unsuccessfully. Although the screenwriter Shi Tuo is a first-time screenwriter, he has several years of creative experience. As a master of novels, based on his annual experience of observing characters and experiencing life, he has created a typical character, Murong Tianxi, which is even more gratifying. This shameless and pretentious character is played by Shi Hui, thus forming a balanced combination of screenwriter, director, and actor.

The screenwriter's character portrayal is successful, but in terms of structure, the reconciliation of Cuibao by Grandpa Gai and the engagement with Young Master Huang are somewhat unclear between the second and third acts, making one feel that something is missing in the middle. At the same time, it is very strange that although the screenwriter touches on the social stratum, the cause of this tragedy has not been emphasized to the level of social problems. The above words are my superfluous demands. Today, we can see the Grand Circus, just as Mr. Li Jianwu said, celebrating for our old China.

The set design of this play is quite difficult. Now we can see such a three-dimensional set design, which is truly commendable.

Again, we discuss the actors. After watching Shi Hui's performance, I seemed to have seen a group of people often seen in the living circle. Now I can understand the explanation of a so-called genius actor, which is to constantly observe characters and experience life. Lu Shan has obviously made great progress. She can play many roles. At first, some people sighed that Xia Xia did not play Grandpa Gai, but after watching Lu Shan's performance, they can be satisfied. Yingzi, Shi Yuan, and Qiao Qi played characters that were compatible, so they were very stable. Zhang Fei is promising, at least we know that she is moved by this play and forgets her ego. It can be said that the rest of Mu Chong, Jiang Shan, Wang Jun, Bai Wen, etc., because they do not have many roles, I have nothing to say.

In short, the Grand Circus has small flaws, but it is rare to see it today.

### After Seeing Yanmen Pass

â Mu Ping

Yanmen Pass is Mr. Wang Cancheng's masterpiece of the past. It is as famous as the colorful sedan chair and the longevity mirror. Southern actors perform this play, which is a combination of north and south, or "Eighth Son Visits His Mother," but the arrangement of the scenes is completely different. Now, among the northern actors who can perform this play, there are only Wang Cancheng's disciples Zhang Keyun and Wang Yulao. When Zhang and Wang came to Shanghai, they both posted performances and sold out the seats. I still remember when Ke Yun performed this play, the supporting roles were Ye Shenglan as the Eighth Son, Yu Sulian as Princess Bilian, Ma Fulu as She Taijun, Furong Cao as Empress Xiao, Yang Baosen as Yang Silang. Wang Yurong played Princess Bilian, while Xiao Linghong played She Taijun, Sun Buting played Eighth Son, and Jin Zhongren played Empress Xiao and Yang Baosen. The above two lineups are very complete. This time, the actors include Zhou Xiaotian as Yang Silang, Gao Weilian as Eighth Son, Wang Lanfang as Empress Xiao, Zhang Huicong as Princess Bilian, and Liu Yunfang as She Taijun. The combination is also very good. The whole play has eight acts, which are performed in two days. The whole plot is tense from beginning to end. Lao Bao's performance of Princess Qinglian in the first part is more important, and he is able to cope with the long passages of lyrics. His voice is trained, bright, sweet, and moist. When he sings high, it is crisp and smooth, like a crane chirping in the sky. When he sings low, it is round and smooth, like jade beads rolling on a plate. His performance is especially delicate and meticulous. He is worthy of being a complete talent for female roles. Zhou Xiaotian's Yang Silang has a few passages of Xipi Yuanban, which are very charming. It can be said that he wins with a little over many. Gao Weilian's Eighth Son sings and acts well. The act of throwing his hair and falling down during the peace talks is very powerful, showing great skill. Liu Yunfang imitates the style of the Qipai and plays the role of an old woman in a serious manner, even better than the Beijing Chao actors. Wang Lanfang's Empress Xiao is even more brilliant in the latter part. When the Empress goes out of the city to welcome the Song army, Lanfang's expression changes in an instant. Yesterday, she was the ruler, and today, she is a slave. She bears the humiliation and wants to force a smile. Such expressions cannot be done by those who are not experienced in this way, and Lanfang is almost there.

### A Record of the Art of Fu Yuntai

â Bing Jiu

Fu Yuntai is a top student of Mr. Su Shaoqing. Mr. Su is a famous Ping Opera artist and a famous teacher. Many students have passed through his doors, and Yuntai is especially outstanding. Shaoqing loves Yuntai very much. Now, he has been hired by the Golden Theater and is showing his talent for the first time. His reputation is outstanding. Although his learning is dedicated and diligent, Mr. Su's contribution cannot be ignored. I once listened to him tuning his voice at the home of my friend Zuo, and then I saw his performance at the Golden Theater. His art is indeed not weak. What is most commendable about Yuntai is his good voice. The breath of female actors is not as good as that of male actors. Yuntai is naturally blessed with both breath and a sweet, bright, and mellow voice, and there is absolutely no sharp, piercing female voice. His pronunciation is clear and his mouth strength is sufficient. This is due to Mr. Su's good guidance. He can perform dozens of plays such as "Catching and Releasing Cao," "Visiting the Mother," "Hongyang Cave," "Empty City Stratagem," and "Selling the Horse." His singing is expansive and his voice is full. Although his stage experience is slightly lacking, and his movements, gestures, and transitions need to be improved, he is still a talented person in general.

Today's New Bride, Miss Xiao Feng

### Playing a Role for Real

â Qing

Two years ago, the four male and female leads of the Shanghai Drama Society's performance of the new wedding comedy, Xia Xia, Han Fei, Zhong Ma, and Xiao Feng, had a romance. Xia Xia and Han Fei were very close, going in and out together. After a while, Zhong Ma and Xiao Feng seemed to be engaged. Now, Zhong Ma and Xiao Feng are finally getting married today at the Jinmen Hotel. Yao Ket specially sent a good couplet: "In the past, they performed the new wedding comedy, playing a role for real. Now, they are getting married for real. The wedding chamber is difficult to compare with the theater. Why bother with the director?" According to the new wedding comedy, Xiao Feng said to Zhong Ma, "Kiss my little nose tip."

### Sharing the Same Boat Through Storms

â He Jia Zhi

10 Flying Peak

"Weicheng, does he know or not? This is a crime committed by their father and son, not by us. It's not our turn to be afraid of him." Huang Longdao, "Anyway, I'm the one going to court, it's not Weicheng brother's business, and it's not Cuizhen sister's business. Second Aunt, I have him." He patted his chest loudly. Mrs. Ye Er smiled, "I think Weicheng is more energetic than Zitian, and stronger than yesterday. He saw Cuizhen come back safe and sound, and he was happy in his heart. He doesn't need me to accompany him anymore. Cuizhen is also tired, and Huang Long is also tired. Go to sleep earlier, we can talk tomorrow." She stood up and beckoned to Cuizhen. Cuizhen also stood up from the short stool, smiled at Weicheng, smiled at Huang Long, and followed Mrs. Ye Er out. Outside, He and the other women were very happy to see Cuizhen come out and crowded around her to go to Mrs. Ye Er's room.

Huang Long did not feel tired at all. He slowly drank two more glasses of wine, leaned back on the chair, and kept his legs on the chair. Weichengdao, "You're drunk, aren't you? Let's drink tomorrow, don't drink today. I still want to drink with you tomorrow." Huang Long laughed in bed, "How can I get drunk with this little bit of wine? I haven't drunk alcohol in prison for a few months, you think about how much wine the hotel owes my stomach. How can I get drunk with this little bit of wine?" He shrugged his shoulders, and he was already lying on the bed with his clothes and shoes on. Weichengdao, "I'll learn some skills from you tomorrow. This is really cheap." Huang Long hiccuped in his throat, "I don't have a teacher to learn skills from, so I don't accept apprentices to learn skills. My skills can be said to be taught by the villains of the world, because when I see the face of a villain, fire will naturally come out of my eyes, and I don't know where the strength in my fingers and toes comes from. If it's not a villain, I won't have any strength." Weichengdao, "I didn't ask you, how did you know that Cuizhen sister was at Sheng Hushan's house?" Huang Longdao, "I have this method. It just so happened that a gust of wind blew open their window and blew out their lamp, so I sneaked in without any effort." (205)
