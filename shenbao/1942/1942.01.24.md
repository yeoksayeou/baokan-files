### The Pacific War Situation is Serious, Britain and America are Actively Reinforcing, Australian Prime Minister Addresses the Australian Crisis, Rumor has it that Flying Fortresses have been Transported to the Dutch East Indies

Saigon, 23rd (Haitong News Agency) - A telegram from Batavia states that the Dutch East Indies newspapers do not seem to underestimate the seriousness of the war situation. The "Java Daily" commented yesterday that, after six weeks of fighting, the situation is more serious than we expected before the war, but it is better than what we feared in the first few days after the outbreak of war. The strong resistance of the Allied forces in Malaya and the Philippines has produced favorable results for the entire war situation, especially for Australia and the Dutch East Indies, because the deployment of reinforcements can be more relaxed. American aircraft and British warships will soon be transferred to the Dutch East Indies. General Wavell's acceptance of the position of commander-in-chief and the establishment of his headquarters in the Dutch East Indies shows that Britain and the United States have provided particularly elite troops for his command.

Melbourne, 23rd (Reuters) - Australian Acting Prime Minister Ford stated in a speech here today that Australians must regard the attack on Rabaul as the first stage of an invasion of Australia. If the Japanese troops land in Rabaul, the war will be closer to Australia. They can use Rabaul as a good base to continue attacking southwards and invade other parts of Australia. The current war situation further increases our urgent need to accelerate the production of equipment and armaments. I had a long conversation with the three service ministers and military leaders today, and I can assure the public that the government and the military are doing their best to cope with the new threats.

### A Brief History of German Paratroopers (9)

It can be mentioned here in passing that gliders are not used to transport paratroopers, although such a fallacy is widely spread. There are obvious technical reasons why it is difficult to transport troops with gliders, and all aviation personnel know this. The speed of the aircraft will inevitably be greatly reduced after towing the glider. Wouldn't this batch of expeditionary aircraft become a good target for the enemy's anti-aircraft guns? If long-distance flights across the sea are required, such as in the Battle of Crete, it would also reduce the flight range of the troop transport aircraft beyond a safe level.

However, the Germans also had something that creatively applied the principle of gliders, which the world did not know, and this thing could be used in the next step of the war, that is, the eighth step. This is a small patrol car, which looks very similar to a Ford product, but is almost entirely made of manganese alloy, and can be lifted lightly by one person. The car can seat two people and is equipped with a flat-shooting gun and a machine gun, all made of light alloy. After adding two glider wings to the side of the car, it can be towed by a transport plane, so this patrol car is actually the fuselage of a glider. After being towed to the destination, the wings are immediately removed, and it becomes a land combat vehicle that can speed away.

8. The first Junkers Ju 90 transport aircraft landed on the captured airfield, carrying the following equipment: portable military wireless radio, extra ammunition, food, bandages, small mortars, a foldable gun mount, and a manganese alloy 75mm rapid-fire gun, as well as a box of lemons to quench the thirst of this group of soldiers who could not get drinks in the fierce battle.

9. After the second transport aircraft arrived, it brought a bicycle detachment of 12 people, each carrying a rifle, hand grenades, flamethrowers, and a complete bicycle. From the third aircraft onwards, each aircraft carried the army; the troops used in the last attack on Crete were all mountain troops.

10. The paratroopers and the army launched a joint offensive. At this time, because the enemy usually has only one type of uniform, it is most likely to cause serious misunderstandings.

11. Transport aircraft continued to arrive, unloading various supplies, including gasoline, light tanks, and motorcycles.

12. Heavier equipment and supplies are transported by ship. In the Battle of Crete, this was done with two captured Greek ships, which were completely emptied, and the bows were blown off by skilled engineering teams. After the ships arrived at their destination, they went full speed ahead and ran onto the beach. They immediately took out the wooden strips they were carrying and built a ramp. At this time, the heaviest tanks were already waiting inside the ship with their engines running. As long as the internal combustion engine was activated, they could drive onto the shore and fight.

Such is the paratrooper offensive. A quote from a German paratrooper commander is also worth mentioning. He said: Military efforts have always been aimed at extending firing capabilities. Basically speaking, a battleship is an extension of the range of coastal artillery; a tank is an extension of various army artillery; a destroyer is an extension of a machine gun; a bomber is an extension of the mouth of a cannon. By this reasoning, paratroopers are an extension of the infantry's offensive power. We know that most of military science is experimental. Regardless of the outcome of this experiment, regardless of whether the aircraft and tank plans can succeed, what can be determined is:

"The application of air force power in war technology has only just begun!" (The End)

### Sketches of Batavia

Batavia is the capital of the Dutch East Indies. Before the 15th century, it was originally named SaendaKlapa. Overseas Chinese still call Batavia Kalapa today. In 1618, the Dutch occupied the area and changed its name to Batavia. It now has a population of more than 500,000 (Surabaya 330,000, Semarang more than 200,000), of which about 80,000 are overseas Chinese, more than 37,000 are Europeans, and about 410,000 are Malays. Since Batavia is the capital of the Dutch East Indies and has a municipal administration, great attention is paid to municipal construction.

It is now learned that the British ship Bao He, which was towed from Wuhan by the East Asia Shipping Company, resumed its Yangtze River service the day before yesterday (the 22nd) at noon. The ship's name remains unchanged. It is reported that the Long He and Wusong will also begin service. As for the American Mail Line's President Harrison, it was escorted to Shanghai by the Japanese Navy on the 20th of this month and docked at Buoy No. 11 and 12. Yesterday morning, it was moved to the Shuntai Wharf in Hongkou. There is currently no confirmed news on how the mail ship will be handled. Also, the French ship Albert Sarraut, which was carrying a large amount of sorghum (i.e., corn) from Haiphong to Shanghai, has been delayed. According to reliable sources, it is scheduled to arrive today and is expected to dock at the Hongsheng Wharf in Pudong for unloading.

### Unregistered Kerosene Seized for Official Sale

The English-language "China Press" reported that the French Municipal Council sent personnel to a cigarette shop at the intersection of Avenue Joffre and Rue Amiral Bayle yesterday (the 23rd) and seized several boxes of unregistered kerosene. The shop was ordered to sell the kerosene at the official price of $5.20 per gallon. As a result, from 4:30 PM to 7:00 PM yesterday and this morning (the 23rd), a large number of citizens, including many Russian women carrying empty bottles, lined up on the side of the road after hearing the news to wait to buy kerosene. Kerosene is currently in extremely short supply, and citizens have no way to purchase it. According to the French Police Department, the kerosene will continue to be sold until it is completely sold out. The Price Management Office of the French Municipal Council is constantly investigating unregistered inventory. If any is seized, it will still be sold publicly.

### Anti-Tuberculosis Association Fundraising Exceeds Target

The Shanghai Anti-Tuberculosis Association launched a campaign last year to raise one million yuan for anti-tuberculosis efforts. It is now learned that it has ended. The Shanghai Tuberculosis Hospital, which is run by the association, was originally located at the former Central Polytechnic Laboratory on Route Ghisi. Recently, the building has been used for other purposes and has been relocated to the Municipal Council Sanatorium on Hongqiao Road as its new location. The hospital currently has 100 patients, all of whom are receiving free treatment. The association's work has not been reduced due to the war. The treatment of tuberculosis at the hospital is entirely charitable, so it continues to be maintained. The one-million-yuan fundraising campaign launched last year has been more successful than expected. The donations received have exceeded the original target. Although the fundraising campaign has officially ended, donations are still coming in steadily. At a time when finance is sluggish and the economic situation is not stable, it is gratifying that the people of Shanghai have been unexpectedly generous in supporting the association. However, this donation will be used to build a new hospital. The ongoing expenses of the charitable hospital run by the association require 10,000 yuan per month, and it still needs to rely on voluntary donations from all sectors of society.

### Jewish Refugee Relief Funds Completely Depleted; Request to the United States for Relief Receives Reply: "Cannot Remit Funds"

Mr. Shekel, representative of the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee, stated that there are approximately 9,000 Jewish refugees, men, women, and children, in Shanghai. They can no longer obtain relief funds from the United States. Unless a large sum of money is raised locally to provide relief, they will all starve to death within a few days. The number of Jewish refugees who can receive one meager meal per day was originally 9,000, but now it has had to be reduced to 4,500. Furthermore, there are a total of 15,000 impoverished Jewish refugees in Shanghai, who are on the verge of starvation because the relief funds have been almost completely depleted. On December 18, the committee received permission from the Japanese authorities and sent an urgent telegram to the Jewish Refugee Committee in New York, stating that "Relief funds are sufficient for a maximum of only fifteen days. If no assistance is received, the refugees will starve to death. Please ask the Geneva Red Cross or other parties to remit funds to Shanghai." Ten days ago, they received a reply containing only the words "Cannot remit funds" without explaining the reason. According to what the local committee has heard, this is due to a violation of the US government's wartime laws. In order to cope with this major problem, the committee has formulated several plans, the most effective of which is to borrow money, but it is still feared that it will be difficult to solve the immediate crisis.

### Butter and Margarine Supplies Abundant

The current consumption of margarine in Shanghai is approximately 4,500 pounds per day. According to a survey conducted last weekend, the inventory of margarine in Shanghai is approximately 200,000 pounds, and the raw materials for manufacturing are approximately 150,000 pounds. The inventory of Japanese merchants is not included. Therefore, the supply of margarine is sufficient for several months. The reason why some grocery stores in Shanghai are unable to sell margarine to meet public demand is that the large amount of margarine in storage is difficult to extract. However, this problem will be resolved in just a few days. Once the inventory is unsealed and distributed to each store according to weekly needs, this shortage will disappear. As for the inventory of butter, it is sufficient for three months. However, the public's need for butter is not as urgent as the need for margarine because the price of butter is more expensive and unemployment is high, resulting in reduced purchasing power among the masses. Although the authorities will also begin controls to reduce current butter consumption in order to preserve a large amount of butter for urgent needs.

### New Bylaws Banning Rent Gratuities and Tips: French Authorities Have Not Yet Expressed Their Views, But Have Decided to Cooperate Closely with the Municipal Council

The English-language "China Press" reports that the four new bylaws submitted by the Municipal Council to the Consular Body, which prohibit the collection of gratuities and the sale of unsanitary food, are expected to receive formal written approval from the Consular Body within a day or two. The contents of the aforementioned two bylaws were published in yesterday's newspaper. The other two bylaws are to penalize traffic violations and to grant the Municipal Council greater power to ban the storage of dangerous goods. Their full text could not be ascertained yesterday morning (the 23rd). Officials of the French Concession Municipal Council are paying close attention to the Municipal Council's ban on rent gratuities and are conducting extensive investigations into the matter. According to a senior official, the procedures for banning gratuities in the French Concession are different from those in the International Settlement. The Municipal Council must first obtain the approval of the Consular Body before implementing new laws and then formulate practical implementation steps. In the French Concession, the Municipal Council must first formulate a practical plan and submit it to the French Consul General for approval. Therefore, the issue of whether the Municipal Council intends to ban gratuities cannot be discussed lightly without the final approval of the French Consul General. Any announcements on such issues will be made by the French Consul General in the form of a notice. It is currently unknown whether the Municipal Council's study of the ban on gratuities has reached its final stage and will soon be submitted to the French Consul General. However, official sources indicate that the Municipal Council is working closely with the International Settlement. The Municipal Council's implementation of the new bylaws will inevitably have an impact on the nature and conduct of administration in the French Concession.

### Tuition Fees Have Increased

— Wang Shu

The issue of children's tuition fees this semester is no less serious than the panic over rice and coal. Ignorant children happily hand over school fee slips to their parents, which is like a death warrant for those with poorer economic circumstances. However, modern parents cannot shirk the responsibility of educating their children, and they have to bear the heavy burden on their shoulders.

Schools have their own sufficient reasons for increasing tuition fees. It is true that they are encountering difficulties, but they have passed these difficulties on to the parents of the students. Increasing tuition fees and adding miscellaneous fees are the implementation of this transition. Although parents are in dire straits, they have to admit that this is a normal method and try their best to cope with it amid complaints. However, a small number of schools are going beyond this "normal method." For example, a certain middle school charges 100 yuan for junior high school tuition, 10 yuan for lecture notes, 5 yuan for compensation preparation, and 5 yuan for equipment fees. Another middle school charges 120 yuan for senior high school, 110 yuan for junior high school, 100 yuan for higher primary school, 96 yuan for middle and small classes, 92 yuan for lower primary school, and 98 yuan for kindergarten. Regardless of the facilities and educational achievements of these two schools, the expensive fees can be said to be the highest in Shanghai schools today. This situation is worth noting.

In the past, schools in Shanghai often collected so-called construction fees from students. This income was considerable, but how many schools have actually built their own school buildings after so many years is not difficult to imagine. Unexpectedly, in the current environment, there are still schools that collect construction fees. Considering that all construction projects in the city are currently at a standstill unless absolutely necessary, I think there is no question of building school buildings. Even if it is said to be a fund for future construction, in the current social situation, when life has reached an extremely difficult stage, it is unreasonable to ask students' parents to bear such a construction fee. This is like adding insult to injury. Wise educators would never want to do this.

The hard life of teachers is a fact that everyone can see. In principle, efforts should be made to improve their treatment. If school authorities can handle matters impartially, it is not impossible. Increasing tuition fees must also have its limits. In addition, some schools have added an item to increase teachers' welfare money. It is said that this fee is entirely used to subsidize teachers, which is not a bad solution. It is hoped that all schools can earnestly improve teachers' treatment. We know that many schools have greatly increased tuition fees this semester, even doubling them. We cannot agree with this situation, but if it can be used entirely to improve teachers' treatment, it would be a fair solution. However, the actual situation is often not as ideal as we imagine, just like the sub-landlord versus the sub-tenant, which is difficult to express in a few words.

It is worth mentioning that a small number of schools are not increasing tuition fees. In this material environment, it is truly commendable. These schools are facing the same difficulties, standing in the midst of wind and rain, but they cannot bear to impose this situation on the parents of the students and are seeking other ways out. Of course, this measure is winning the sympathy of parents, but the schools are taking great pains. These schools are in the minority, and because they are in the minority, their spirit of running schools is even more admirable. This is worthy of praise.

### Shen Bao Reader Assistance Fund: Application Deadline Advanced; Too Many Applications, Limited Funds; Deadline Set for the 26th, No Extension

Since the start of applications for this year's Shen Bao Reader Assistance Fund, the staff at the registration office have been extremely busy every day receiving and issuing application forms and numbering and issuing registration cards. Hundreds of application forms are received every day, and the academic results are all excellent. However, the donations received this time are less, and the deposits are also limited, so there is a sense of being a drop in the bucket and difficult to provide assistance to everyone. After consideration, the application date has to be advanced (originally scheduled for February 2). It has now been decided that the application deadline will be 5:00 PM on the 26th of this month, with no extension. After the 26th, registration office personnel will refuse to accept applications. Please pay attention, and we hope that people from all walks of life will actively donate to the fund.

### Shanghai Pude Society Appeals for Donations of Clothing, Rice, and Meal Tickets

The Shanghai Pude Society actively carries out various charitable activities, such as providing clothing and rice, meal tickets and porridge tickets, small loans, annual free medical consultations and medicine, and establishing free schools. Their achievements are remarkable. This year's winter relief will be carried out as before. Since the beginning of winter, the distribution of rice alone has reached tens of thousands of yuan. Although purchasing rice is difficult, they are still trying their best to avoid interruption. They hope that all great benefactors will continue to donate generously, providing righteous grain and benevolent soup to benefit the poor. The society issues clothing tickets for 16 yuan per set, meal tickets for 15 yuan per book, and porridge tickets for 9 yuan per book. If you would like to purchase clothing or meal tickets, or donate funds for rice distribution, free school expenses, or small loans, please send them to the Pude Society at 8 Wenyi Road, Wenzhou Road, Avennue Edward VII, or notify them by telephone (93671), and they will send someone to pick them up immediately.

### The Public Works Department Relief Committee Plans to Establish an Economical Canteen to Aid Foreigners

The Shanghai Times reports that the Relief Committee specially established by the Public Works Department, chaired by Mr. Minsde, is currently studying ways to aid impoverished foreigners in Shanghai. According to sources within the Public Works Department, the committee has held several meetings and has reached several resolutions after discussion, but has not yet announced them. The main suggestion being studied by the committee is the establishment of a low-cost canteen to provide food for impoverished foreigners. The Public Works Department has also urged various foreign associations to provide self-help to their compatriots, and the department will provide assistance. It is reported that Shanghai residents of some countries have already taken relief steps separately, but they are still waiting for the Public Works Department to engage in general relief. The bureau will not neglect this. Also, the English-language "China Press" reports that the American Civilian Relief Committee of this city has been established for a short time, and has achieved considerable results in providing relief to Americans who have lost their jobs due to the outbreak of the Pacific War. However, due to insufficient funding, it is hoped to receive donations of cash. The donations received by the committee are not small, but they are mostly in the form of checks, so it is hoped that the relevant Japanese authorities will allow these checks to be cashed immediately. Two weeks ago, the committee temporarily established a canteen in the central district, which now provides two meals a day to 107 impoverished Americans, half of whom are Americans and Filipinos, and a small number of whom are Chinese born in the United States. The scope of this relief is still felt to be insufficient, so the committee plans to set up a permanent canteen at the American School on Beichang Road in the middle of next week to cook food and distribute it to two or three distribution centers throughout the city, so that impoverished Americans can receive food.

### Bread Made with Inferior Materials

It is rumored that some famous bread shops in this city are illegally saving flour and fuel, and baking substandard bread. Many citizens have found that the bread they bought is not fully baked, or even unbearably damp.

### Handguns Found, Large Number of Bandits Arrested, More Than 10,000 Yuan Robbed from the Huadong Bakery

The French police received a confidential report yesterday stating that a large number of bandits were hiding and plotting to rob. The police immediately dispatched Chief Inspector Gui Baoquan, Deputy Inspector Xie Guangming, Chief Detective Zhou Buguang, Wei Yuansheng, Zhou Kaishao, Detectives Yan Jinwen, Wang Tianyou, Yang Jiaxue, etc., fully armed, to No. 12 Yide Lane, Caishi Street, to arrest bandits Peng A'er and Liu Haoqing on the second floor at 0:30 AM yesterday. Four hand grenades and a four-inch handgun were confiscated. According to their confessions, they rushed to Room 58 of the Southeast Hotel at No. 8, Lane 401, Aiduya Road, and arrested Zhang Yide, Zhang Baoshan, Feng Jinbao, Li Donglin, Zhao Fa, and five others. Later, they went to Room 29 of the Chunjiang Hotel at No. 9, Lane 309, Caishi Street, and arrested the bandit leader Guo Zhigang (31 years old, from Shandong) and his concubine Xu Zhen (30 years old, from Jiangyin), as well as Zhang Liansheng, Zhang Peisong, Zhang Peijiang, Guo Jinxiang, Guo Tianpeng, Liu Qingyuan, and six others in Room 36. Then they went to No. 11, Lane 182, Pu'en Jishi Road, to arrest bandit Gu Axi, but failed. They then went to the Huadong Bakery at No. 1, Lane 155, Xuehuali Road, and arrested Wang Zhaokun, an employee of the factory from Shandong. The factory was robbed of more than 10,000 yuan in cash on the evening of the 9th of this month. Wang was an inside contact for the robbers. After being taken to the police station for investigation, it was reported that the above-mentioned bandits had confessed to more than a dozen crimes committed before and after the case. The investigation is still underway.

### Yarn Company Employee Steals Chop, Illegally Withdraws Deposits and is Arrested

Zhao Baolian, a native of Ningbo, is 19 years old and works at Baohua Xing Cotton Yarn Company at No. 31, Lane 305, Fujian Road. A few days ago, the company suddenly received a notice from Dingkang Qianzhuang at No. 5, Lane 247, Tianjin Road, with which it had no previous dealings, stating that all deposits had been withdrawn. The manager of the company, Chuan Fengxiang, became suspicious after receiving this notice. According to the accounts, there were still more than 3,000 yuan in deposits. After a careful investigation, a check No. 6 was found to have been stolen. He rushed to Dingkang to investigate and learned that someone had stolen Chuan's chop and withdrew 3,600 yuan in cash on the 9th of this month. It was undoubtedly done by an employee of the company. He reported the information to the Laozha Police Station and ordered detective Zhou Zhenxing to investigate. Zhao Baolian was suspected and arrested. Under questioning, Zhao confessed to stealing Chuan's chop and withdrawing money privately. In addition to confiscating 860 yuan in cash, it was also learned that Zhao had 1,000 yuan in cash deposited in the Huizhong Bank. He was ordered to be detained and sent to the Fifth Criminal Court of the First Special Court yesterday morning. The police lawyer Fang Fushu filed a lawsuit according to law and requested a postponement. After interrogation by the judge Chuan, he ordered him to be detained pending a further hearing.

### Rice Shops in Two Concessions That Have Ceased Operations are Temporarily Allowed to Sell National Rice

Since the authorities of the two concessions restricted the operation of rice shops, hundreds of rice shops have closed down, and more than 3,000 employees have lost their jobs. The problem of livelihood is very serious. Therefore, the rice shops in the two concessions that have ceased operations jointly submitted a document to the authorities of the two concessions on the 19th of this month, requesting relief. According to the news from the Rice Industry Association yesterday, the board of directors of the Public Works Department also discussed the rice industry issue a few days ago. It is reported that as a result of the discussion, the business licenses of the rice shops that have ceased operations will not be revoked, and they will be temporarily allowed to sell national rice first. It is also learned that a few days ago, Western police officers led translators to inquire about the rice shops that had ceased operations in the area of ​​Ladu Road, Ganshidong Road, and Maiqi Road in the French Concession, and ordered them to change their business as soon as possible, and they could exchange for licenses, otherwise they would be regarded as violating the law and would be punished. At that time, some rice shops had already stamped their seals to comply, but because they could not change their business for a while, they are now waiting for the results of the joint appeal of the rice shops that have ceased operations to the authorities for relief.

### Gunman Who Shot the Owner of a Copper and Tin Shop Sentenced

Zhao Guangguo, Yao Jiru, Huang Jinming, and others from Jiangbei, under the instigation of others, carried weapons and suddenly went to the Tongchangxiang Copper and Tin Shop at No. 150, Xinzha Road, at 6:30 PM on October 7 last year, and shot and killed the manager of the shop, Wang Hanqing, a 50-year-old native of Nanjing. Xu Zhenzheng and He Yun from the Xinzha Police Station arrested Zhao, Yao, and Huang and sent them to the First Special Court. The police lawyer Zhang Tianyin filed a lawsuit according to law. After a clear interrogation, Judge Dai announced the verdict in the Second Criminal Court yesterday morning: Zhao Guoguang was sentenced to life imprisonment, Yao Jiru was sentenced to 15 years imprisonment, and Huang Jinming was sentenced to 5 years imprisonment.

### Main Offender Arrested for Extortion of Two Million Yuan

Yao Yizhang (41 years old), the owner of Dingxin Dyeing and Weaving Factory at No. 196, Ganshidong Road, French Concession, a native of Ningbo, has been operating for many years and has accumulated a lot of savings, which has aroused the covetousness of bandits. Zhu Shihua (31 years old), a native of Jiading who had been dismissed from the factory, suddenly went to Yao's place at 9:00 AM on December 12 last year to threaten and extort 2 million yuan. At that time, Yao was very frightened, so he asked Zhu to find a way, and said that he could not get such a huge sum of money, and asked if he could reduce it. Zhu then agreed to find a way and left. Until the next morning, five people suddenly came to Yao's house aggressively. Yao hurriedly avoided them, and the people left in dismay. That evening, Zhu went again, and Yao treated him like a distinguished guest, thinking that Zhu's words were true, so he invited Zhu to the factory's distribution office at No. 4, Yuqing Lane, Lane 261, West Xinjiao Street, and gave Zhu 200 yuan as a reward. Unexpectedly, on the 14th, a phone call suddenly came, instructing Yao to quickly prepare 2 million yuan, otherwise he would be arrested. On the 16th, Zhu went to Yao's place again. Yao told the truth and rewarded Zhu with another 1,000 yuan. Until the 17th, the matter was learned by the French police. Zhu was arrested at 11:00 AM and taken to the police station for investigation. It was found that Zhu had completely colluded to extort money unsuccessfully, so he was sued according to law. After interrogation, Zhu Shihua was sentenced to two years of imprisonment yesterday as a warning.

### Labor-Management Agreement for Cinemas Signed Yesterday

Minghua News Agency reports that more than 1,000 employees of 38 cinemas in this city, including Da Guangming, Nanjing, Guotai, Meiqi, Dahua, Da Shanghai, Xinguang, Huguang, Jincheng, Lido, Guanglu, Jinmen, Paris Lafayette, Zhejiang, Dumei, Guolian, Xia'erden, Central Xindu, Jiuxing, etc., had a dispute due to requesting an increase in wages from the management. After mediation by the authorities, the problem was resolved. Recently, all employees continued to request that both parties be convened to sign a collective agreement in order to abide by it. After repeated convening of labor and management parties by the authorities for sincere negotiations, opinions have become consistent. A 15-article agreement was signed yesterday. The main points are as follows: Workers' wages should be increased by 35% from September as a cost-of-living allowance, calculated according to the existing wages. In addition to the draft agreement signed on May 6, the hospital will increase the allowance for workers by 20 yuan per person per month from September (a total of 60 yuan per person per month). The increase or decrease of the allowance will still be handled in accordance with the draft agreement. If the prices of daily necessities fall in the future, the allowance should also be reduced, and the standard of reduction will be decided by the hospital and the workers through collective discussion. The original provision of meals and accommodation and the supply of rice at parity by the hospital is an extra benefit and should not be changed or stopped for any reason. The extra allowance for the machine operator shall be handled in accordance with the draft agreement signed on May 6. That is, 20 yuan per person per month for the first-run theater, 15 yuan per person per month for the second-run theater, and 10 yuan per person per month for the third-run theater or below. This extra allowance is limited to three people per theater. For all external agents to test films, each machine room will be rewarded with 20 yuan in national currency. The hospital should issue double salaries to workers at the end of the year (including wages and cost-of-living allowances). The hospital should extract the workers' bonuses from the surplus at the end of each year and distribute them according to the proportion of the workers' wages.

Since the British-owned China General Omnibus Company announced its closure on the 11th of this month, 2,700 unemployed workers have been continuously given severance pay by the management. However, as of now, there are still more than 700 workers who have not received their severance pay and bonuses, because they are dissatisfied with the severance measures announced by the management and refuse to accept them. The remaining 2,000 workers received their severance pay a few days ago and returned to their hometowns or changed to other jobs.

Huasheng Electric Appliance Factory in this city is a giant in the Shanghai electric appliance manufacturing industry, but recently, due to the phenomenon of depression, its business has become bleak. It is reported that it has been suspended since the day before yesterday and more than 200 workers have been laid off. The amount of severance pay for each worker is still to be determined after sincere negotiations between labor and management.

Tongyi Textile Factory at No. 229, Moyu Road, laid off 3,200 workers at the beginning of this month. According to inquiries yesterday morning, the severance pay and year-end bonuses of all workers were paid in full on Wednesday. It is reported that each worker was subsidized by the management with 50 yuan for travel expenses to return to their hometown, and the year-end bonus was issued according to their service performance, ranging from 60 yuan to 140 yuan.

Since the Yong'an No. 3 Yarn Factory on Maigen Road stopped production, it will be finished soon. It is reported that the wages due to the 3,000 workers laid off by the factory have been paid a few days ago, but the severance pay is still under negotiation due to the wide divergence of opinions between labor and management.

The operation of Tongji Printing and Dyeing Factory at No. 20, Binlang Road, has always been good, and it has made a lot of profits. However, recently, it has also decided to lay off all workers on the pretext of sluggish sales and no intention to continue operations. It is reported that the wages and severance pay of all workers have begun to be distributed the day before yesterday, but less than 100 people have received them. The Shengde Lace Factory on Xia Shabo Road has seen its business plummet due to the cut-off of lace exports, and has had to lay off 100 workers. Long-term workers are given 55 yuan in severance pay per person, and pieceworkers are given 30 yuan.

### Letter

Sir, I found a piece of news about my suicide on August 24 last year, which is inconsistent with the facts. Although I have been in great distress for the past four years, I am still able to use my reason to deal with the situation. I am deeply ashamed of my contempt for life and the world. I am not willing to be ashamed of my remaining life, so I am writing to you to request correction. Sincerely, Fang Zhengyi.

Today's newspaper distribution time is 6:10.

Spring and Autumn

### The Predicament of Charitable Organizations

— Tu Tu

Lost children, rescued abducted children, and released children have always been sent by the Public Works Department's Children's Protection Section to various charitable organizations for accommodation after interrogation by the police. Recently, the police have several lost children who have not been claimed. As usual, they can be sent to charitable organizations, but because most charitable organizations have fallen into a state of shutdown, and a few that continue to exist are also experiencing economic panic, there is nowhere to send them, and they have to be temporarily left at the police station.

Famous charitable organizations in this city, such as the Jiliang Institute and Puyi Craft Society sponsored by Christianity, and the Xin Puyu Hall sponsored by Catholicism, each have no less than a thousand old, weak, disabled, poor, and helpless men and women who are accommodated and educated. Their daily source of income is from abroad, especially the China Charity Fund in the church and the Red Cross's disaster relief rice and wheat. Now they are unable to continue to obtain them, and donations in this city are also decreasing due to the double effect of rising prices and the economic downturn. Whenever the heads of charitable organizations frequently appeal to the society, their common situation is: how can they bear to repatriate the people who have been accommodated and educated; and how can they refuse to accept those who have extremely pitiful circumstances who have not been accommodated, so the number of people accommodated will not decrease, the supply is increasing day by day, and the difficult situation is really indescribable.

The head of the Jiliang Institute recently appealed that this Sunday, that is, tomorrow, the institute will run out of food. This is not the misfortune of one charitable organization, but the misfortune of most charitable organizations. Their experience is the bad news for the society. Seeing countless people who have crossed the sea of ​​suffering falling back into the abyss of hunger, can we be indifferent? Their appeal should be responded to by all those who have the spare capacity to help others, and put into practice the motto of the Youth Association "Not to serve people, but to be served by people."

### Thoughts on Household Survey

— Liao Mu

The population of Shanghai, after the outbreak of the Shanghai War, is said to be more than 4 million, but some estimates are outside 5 million. There are different opinions, and it is difficult to reach a consensus. However, until December 8 last year, the outbreak of the Pacific War, there were many people who automatically returned to their hometowns because they could not make a living. The number of people who were advised by the authorities and given convenience to leave this place is also considerable. According to statistics, this repatriation of people should be 600,000. This is also a fact. It is expected that there will be a larger number after a month. Under the influence of the decline of various industries, the floating laborers and employees naturally have the pain of wandering and being at a loss. It is certainly not a good thing to stay here for a long time. This really makes the authorities rack their brains and think about solutions.

However, the repatriation methods after the recent period should be more perfect and appropriate, so that the people can seek peace of mind, and the authorities will be more concerned about planning.

According to reports, the authorities plan to investigate the entire population of the concession starting from the beginning of next month in order to maintain public order and allocate supplies (such as rationing food by population) and obtain accurate statistics. This is indeed a heavy task. In order to rectify the neighborhoods and settle the citizens, the method should be as proper as possible and the procedures should be perfect, so that it will not cause a disadvantage. Wen Yanbo said: "When the authorities act, they must conform to the people's hearts, take into account the opinions of the public, and take tranquility and solemnity as the priority!" Calmness and not sitting idle, seriousness and avoiding disturbance, local affairs are generally like this. It is also heard that the French Concession has agreed with the Masnan Road Post Office to borrow the staff messengers of the bureau to undertake the investigation work at that time. By extension, all personnel of large-scale folk commercial institutions can also serve. This is more appropriate and cheaper for the neighborhoods, and it can also be seen that the authorities have worked hard.

In this extraordinary period, the population survey should pay more attention to the following points:

The attitude should be kind during the investigation, and no strictness should be allowed. There is no need to be harsh between neighborhoods on matters that are not of great importance. Give residents convenience in terms of work and rest. Show the investigators' identity certificates more often to avoid anxiety and misunderstanding. The investigation should be realistic without delaying time.

I hope that the authorities will take care of everything else, then the authorities and the residents will be fortunate!

Mother: "A'nan, tomorrow is your happy day, why are you feeling unhappy? Is there anything else that is not as you wish?"

Daughter: "It was supposed to be good, coming in a car and leaving in a car, it's comfortable and stylish. Now I have to change to a sedan chair, which is stuffy and ugly, how can I not be depressed?"

Seventeen Home

Qiuhaitang's mind gradually cleared from the next day. Of course, he also knew how much money was left at home, so he repeatedly comforted Meibao, telling her not to be busy asking doctors. According to his idea, he simply wanted to copy his old method when he was in Zhangshutun, and grit his teeth to endure the twenty-four ribs.

He gritted his teeth to endure the soreness all over his body, and didn't hum easily. He didn't cough unless he couldn't control it. He tried his best to make the heavy illness look like an ordinary cold.

But Meibao was no longer a child. Seeing that he was not eating, the fever was not receding, and he was often coughing up blood sooner or later, how could he hide it from her?

"Third brother, your illness is really not light this time, and you can't help but ask the doctor every day." Old Man Han was also a very righteous person, so he helped Meibao to persuade Qiuhaitang: "Although we are strangers and not related by blood, we are still friends in need. At present, we can't help but spend the money of the younger brother first. I hope you will be safe and sound, and you can settle the accounts in the future."

As he said that, his daughter immediately handed a stack of banknotes to Meibao. Although it was only fifty yuan, it already had ten yuan bills, five yuan bills, and one yuan bills.

"No, old brother, it's not... not... generous..." Qiuhaitang knew very well about Old Han's situation, so he refused to accept it to the death.

After everyone pushed back and forth for a long time, it was finally resolved by Meibao's compromise solution.

"I'm not being polite to Uncle Han and elder sister," Bao said eloquently. That kind of outstanding and decisive expression was exactly the same as when Luo Xiangqi discussed housework with Qiuhaitang in the house on Milang Street in Tianjin more than ten years ago. (313)

Miscellaneous Tales

### Sichuan Opera

— Ze Fu

Sichuan local opera has two main types: silk-string opera and Gaoqiang opera. Silk-string opera evolved from Han tunes and Qin腔 (another type of opera), so it features tunes like Xipi, Erhuang, and Bangzi. Famous plays include "The Palace of Eternal Life," "Sacrificing Yue Wu Mu," and "Mu Guiying Shoots the Wild Goose." Gaoqiang opera evolved from Yiyang Tune, and it doesn't use silk strings, only drums and clappers. However, when singing, there are also tune names (called "Pai Zi" by Sichuan people), such as "Moon High," "Water Lily," and "Beautiful Garden." Notable plays include "Love Trial," "Stealing the Red Silk," and "Stealing the White Banner." "Love Trial" tells the story of "Wang Kui Betrays Guiying," and it is said to have been adapted by Zhao Yaosheng, a Hanlin scholar from Sichuan during the late Qing Dynasty. Therefore, the lyrics are elegant, and it is regarded as the crown jewel of Sichuan opera. When singing Gaoqiang opera, the backstage orchestra always echoes the singer, which is called tune support, similar to Yiyang Tune. For example, in "Love Trial," when the female lead (Guiying) sings the Water Lily tune: "A chilling wind blows," the orchestra immediately responds: "The dark moon has no light." She sings again: "Tears of lovesickness have long stained my cheeks, until now," and the orchestra replies: "Transformed into a sea of misfortune." A unique feature of Sichuan opera is its emphasis on facial expressions and gestures, with distinct differences for each word. For instance, when singing "Kill or not kill," the gesture for "kill" involves a horizontal chopping motion with the right hand, and the gesture for "not" involves a waving motion with the right hand. The gesture for "kill" is again a horizontal chopping motion with the right hand. Every word is meticulously performed, hence the saying: "Listen" to Ping opera, "watch" Sichuan opera.

Must-Read for Love

### Love and Life

— Lin Feng

The day before yesterday, there was a news report of "a man and woman committing suicide by taking poison." A young man and woman, ××× and ×××, were a free-love couple who naturally advocated for free marriage. However, they faced a mountain of old ethics that hindered their intentions. Moreover, the man had recently lost his job, meaning he temporarily lost the autonomy of his economic life. In other words, they lacked the subjective conditions for marriage. Under such dual pressure, a fierce struggle arose within them. On one hand, they were unwilling to be sacrificed under the old ethical marriage system; on the other hand, they could not build a new marriage through their own efforts. Under this stimulation, they lost their minds, couldn't see the future of their lives clearly, and thus chose death to express their resistance to those who hindered their marriage!

If this reasoning is correct, then we can frankly say that their actions were wrong. It merely tells people once again that tigers eat people, but it does not provide people with a way to avoid being eaten by tigers or a method to kill tigers.

Here, we must touch upon the relationship between love and life again. Some say that "love is the source of human life" (Comte). We oppose this "love above all else" view. We do not deny the role of love in the evolution of human life. What we want to say is that love is one aspect of human life, not the whole. The world has seen many people living various lives without love, but it has not seen anyone living happily with only love.

It seems like we've strayed too far. We should bring it closer. Today, how to establish a correct view of love is what every young person should care about. Generally speaking, in the current era, we cannot have excessively high demands regarding love. As long as we can find someone decent, we should resolve it and spend the extra time and energy doing more meaningful things. That is the right way.

### Stage and Screen

— A Hui

Xi Jianong has joined the National League as a professional actor, and his position is Deputy Director of the Drama Department.

Stage director Wu Renzhi will be promoted to film director by Zhou Jianyun. His debut work is "Turbulent Times," with a script written by Ke Ling. Shi Hui will play the male lead, and Ying Yin was originally intended for the female lead. Now that Ying Yin has passed away, they have to find someone else. Filming will begin on February 1st and is scheduled to be completed in one month.

The unstable Lianxing Company has built a studio opposite Zhaofeng Park. The original plan was to film "Bi Xue Qian Qiu" as their first film, directed by Ma Xuweibang and starring Ying Yin, who had already received a deposit of one thousand yuan. However, the production of the film was too complicated and was abandoned. But after a meeting at the Atlantic Hotel the day before yesterday, the filming plan was finally decided.

The Tianfeng Theatre Group will be disbanded at the end of this month after performing at the Xuan Palace. Starting next month, the Shanghai Shanghai Opera Troupe, currently performing at the Queen's Theatre, will take over and perform improved Shanghai Opera. As for the Queen's Theatre, Yao Shuijuan will take over and perform Yue Opera.

### "Watch Out for Your Money"

When the crowd is so tight that you can't breathe, there will be some "caring people" shouting, "Everyone, watch out for your money!" Everyone will inevitably take a look or touch their money. Of course, you are being careful, but you also let people know where you keep your money, giving them an opportunity to take advantage of you. So, "watch out for your money" must be done to the end. Don't just take a look and touch it and be done. It's futile to squeeze forward with all your might because by the time you get to the counter, you won't see or touch anything. You will only fall into the sadness of "failure for lack of one final effort."

Commercial News

### National Rice Softens: Origin Still a Problem

The price of national rice has been falling again and again. Yesterday, the weather was still clear, and the rice continued to arrive from the suburbs, intensifying the price decline. It is estimated that there are still more than 400 shi of various types of rice samples on the market, causing buyers to stand by and watch, not daring to make a move rashly. Seeing that there were few buyers and fearing that they couldn't hold on, the rice owners unanimously started selling off their stocks. As a result, early-season thin rice was all devalued to $193 or $192.50. However, during the early market, rice owners were still considering their own costs and attempted to hold the price, initially opening at $195, with some transactions at $194. Observing the closing price compared to before, it fell by about $3. Due to this sluggishness, thick粳 rice was also difficult to sustain and was seen dragging down prices by $2-3. Kunshan high-grade粳 rice opened at $230, $228-229. General market粳 rice was $224-225. The arrival of Jintan white rice continued, and the sales market was relatively active due to seasonal demand, so the selling price was slightly tighter, opening at $200.

If the authorities can grant leniency for the recent number of national rice arrivals, the supply can be increased further, and the selling price can be lowered gradually to alleviate the tension of public sales of foreign rice, providing stability for the future of the people's food supply. However, this may not be allowed by the current situation. As for the transportation and supply, it is eagerly hoped for by the citizens. However, according to rice merchants yesterday, the authorities have allowed the industry to transport rice from Jiangsu and Anhui, but to control the selling price, the cost of rice from Jiangsu and Anhui is limited to $100 per 100 kilograms for rice from south of the Yangtze River and $90 for rice from Anhui south of the Yangtze River. However, the current production price of Anhui rice is almost the same, while Jiangsu province is still far away. It is difficult to predict whether this will become a reality. As for the current economic decline and the high cost of daily necessities, the natural dispersion of the population is an inevitable result. It is not necessary to take the虛 of the grain market as the standard for population gathering and dispersion. If people in the industrial and commercial sectors reach the point of unemployment, how can they stay in Shanghai as sojourners for long? Returning to the countryside to "farm" will happen without persuasion. Since food is a major prerequisite for stabilizing people's livelihoods and maintaining public order, it is still essential to smooth the supply, provide food to the people, and prevent bandits from running rampant and搶食 from becoming prevalent. This is also a key point in stabilizing the rear.

The market price of bran has risen. The trade guilds plan to take advantage of the high price to sell off their stocks, and it is said that factories are also selling. Therefore, the early market price of Sanxin bran yesterday was still the original price of $56.50, but in the afternoon it fell slightly to $55.80. Orchid bran fell slightly to $54.20, with 1,300-1,400 bags transacted.

Wheat stocks are low, and Japanese factories continue to actively sell flour, so the demand is increasing. The retail price of high-quality杜麦 has risen from $85 to $90 but is still difficult to collect smoothly. Therefore, the two batches of杜客麦 that were collected yesterday have been priced at $95.

Due to the scarcity of supply, edible oil continues to rise in price. Yesterday, 100 dan of Qing oil from the Dayou Factory were sold for $326. Thirty barrels of Dalian soybean oil were priced at $434, later raised to $438. The market trend is very firm.

Regarding soybeans, the owners still wanted to continue raising prices yesterday, but the number of buyers decreased, so the market was firm. It is estimated that 30 bags of Pudong Du soybeans were sold for $122, and 100 bags of Tianjin green beans were sold for $120.

Due to the scarcity of sesame arrivals recently and the high production price in the interior, the market is trending higher. Yesterday, the selling price of Mingguang white sesame was $130 for 50 bags, and Anqing black sesame was $180 for 20 bags.

Small amounts of red sorghum have been transported in, but the actual sales have weakened, so the market is trending flat. Yesterday, two trucks of Mingguang red sorghum were sold, with high-quality goods priced at $54.70 and medium-quality goods at $52.

Soybean cake continued to trend higher yesterday as hoarders slightly favored it, with the price rising by about 50 cents. It is estimated that 3,000 pieces of Shengji soybean cake were sold, with April warehouse receipts priced at $22.20, June warehouse receipts at $22.60, and September warehouse receipts at $24.40.

Due to successive arrivals of corn, people's hearts softened, and with散囤 selling off their stocks yesterday, the price fell by $1 to $1.50. It is estimated that 150 bags of Nanjing corn were sold for $55, one truck of Huangdu corn for $56, 100 bags of Holland white corn for $50, and 20 bags of yellow corn for $51.50 to $51. Two hundred bags of Xixiang old corn were priced at $49.50 to $49. Two hundred bags of Xixiang old corn were priced at $49.50 to $49. Another 300 bags of new corn were priced at $57 to $58. Also, 100 tons from Yinghua Company, warehouse goods in Hongkou were $81.50, and Mitsubishi warehouse goods were $90.

### Cash Bar Stability

Yesterday's cash bars were quite stable, with prices still fluctuating between $10,800 and $10,900. Due to some interest from the Decheng money exchange and certain financial circles and silver houses, the price was slightly raised after falling. People's hearts were very calm. From the morning, a certain gold shop first sold 10 taels to the silver house industry, still at a price of $10,800. The gold shop continued to sell 10 taels to Chengji, slightly less at $10,700. As the cash gold shop sold out slightly, Yutai Feng, Hefeng, Decheng, etc., bought in from time to time, immediately increasing by $250. A certain money house entered 20 taels at $10,950. Xiangxingyong sold slightly down to $10,880. At 11 o'clock, Hefeng entered the same Kangyong 10 taels for $10,900, which was more stable later, retreating to $10,850. The final transaction price was $10,870, up $70 from the previous day, with a high and low of $250 on the day, with a total of 1,200 to 1,300 taels opened. Jewelry gold was priced at $1,150 by Daxiin Tonghang (purchases reduced by $200), and silver was still $16, and the black market was $11.

Yesterday's foreign exchange market, British and American gold pounds were still at the original price, the former being $255 and the latter being $260. US dollar bills slightly retreated to $15.45, Hong Kong bills were $2.67, and military bills rose slightly to $3.95.

Yesterday, the discount rate for bills of exchange remained flat, and the Shanghai Money Industry Association's intraday interest rate suddenly hung at a huge fraction of four points, only suspending two points.

### Government Bonds Rise More Strongly

The market for government bonds in the black market yesterday rose even more strongly. Type C has already risen above the closing price on December 6th, and the market price after the incident has exceeded that before the incident. The reason is difficult to find. Although interest cannot be paid anywhere, it is too far away and not welcome by Shanghai bondholders, nor can it be handled by a few bondholders. It is said that there are organizations of long-term companies, but the price has been raised for a long time and the market price is already high. It is unknown how to get rid of it in the future. Interest will soon be removed for calculation. Holding Shanghai unpaid interest is also not a good plan. For example, Type C opened at $67.7 (the same price as December 6th) and rose to $8.4, closing at $7.8. Type A opened at $72.5, rose to $2.7, and closed at $2.5. Type B opened at $68.3, rose to $8.9, and closed at $8.7. Type D was $64.6-7, closing at $4.4. Type E opened at $65.3, rose to $6.1, and closed at $5.6. Qian Yishun Tai bought the most, followed by Hongda Hengkang. There were no fewer than six or seven sellers. Although the market's popularity is strong, it is not allowed by the environment, nor is it a high price that should be had normally. It is feared that the reaction is not far away. As a result, it rose by another 90 cents to $1.10, with transactions of about $600,000 to $700,000.

Yesterday, the black market price of foreign shares in the public enterprise was mostly lower. Only real estate prices in the industry rose slightly, from $11.7 to $12.3. Jardine Spinning Mills sellers called for $19, and buyers only started at $18.6. The entry and exit prices of Jardine Beer differed by one dollar, from $3.5 to $4.5. Tram was $28 to $29.2. The buying price of public buses was $7, and the selling price required $8.5. Asia Navigation was $5.7, Langerzhi was $9.5, and Rubber was $10. In addition to buyers, the rest had supply but no demand. It is estimated that Yangtze called for $11.8, Shanghai Silver Company was $12, Jardine Matheson was $55, Shanghai Wool was $5, Telephone was $20, Xiangtai Timber was $24, Steel was $14.7, and the rest had no price.

### Yarn Market Still Closed: Spot Selling Price Increasing Daily

The cotton yarn market started weak and then rose, and the trend is still firm. However, the spot market is still closed. However, there are a few peers who gather in the open air to trade, which is a slight embellishment. The starting price for 20-count Double Horse factory orders was $1,395. Households with sufficient economic resources came to buy, and the price was seen rising again. There were calls for $1,400 to be entered, but there were very few suppliers, and the final price was $1,440. As a result, the price was similar to the previous day. However, the floor spot market is rising daily. The spot price of 20-count Yueqin is $2,295, up $50. Twenty-count Blue Phoenix factory orders cannot be bought for $2,400, and 42-count Blue Phoenix is $3,900, which is a factory order. The market transaction is abnormally quiet, with only 10-20 bales traded.

### Market Sales Remain Sluggish: Factory Cloth Yesterday's Actual Sales Remain Sluggish

And the selling price of existing cloth is still firm and strong. The morning market price of 16-pound Butterfly coarse cloth opened at $117.75, and the afternoon market called for $118. Samsung coarse cloth was $100, Double Dragon coarse cloth was $98, Dapeng fine cloth was $95, and Fugui fine cloth was $91.5. Danggui fine twill was $87.5, but few were sold.

The starting price for the dragon head fine cloth in the East Cloth spot market was $82.75, and the afternoon close was $82.2. The spot dragon head fell to $88. The Four Gentlemen drill stack orders sold for $2.75, and the spot price was $3.05.

### Woolen Cloth Sales Decline

The current Western clothing industry is extremely desolate, and the sales of woolen cloth are not smooth, and the market has also turned cold accordingly. Recently, Zhanghua merino wool and horse pants wool have dropped to $66 per yard, Yinfeng 401 horse pants wool is $70, 171 medium-thick wool is $75, 151 is $70, grass green and navy blue gabardine is $68, Dalong Walter wool is $55, thin plain drill is $38, Jiangshan horsehair lining is $3.5, Gongping charcoal lining is $8.25, and Yousheng rainproof cloth is $9.5.

### Golden Vegetables Rise Again

Due to the lack of golden needle vegetables for a long time and the lack of replenishment, combined with the persistent high production price, in addition to the Taiwan gang's continuous procurement, Shenjiamen and other places have also purchased recently, and the industry is anxious to replenish, so the rising trend has started again. Yesterday, the market number of high-quality goods opened at $300 again, and ordinary goods also require $250-260.

### A Look at New Year Cake, Past and Present

The year is coming to an end, and the commercial market is sluggish. Speaking of the Shanghai New Year cake market, there is even more of a feeling of "cannot win over the past." Before the war, a dollar of sugar New Year cake could get eight or nine pounds to more than ten pounds, and a dollar of Ningbo New Year cake could even get more than twenty pounds. The enjoyment of prosperity and the pleasant life at that time were truly beyond words. However, at the end of the first winter after the war, each yuan could still buy five or six pounds of sugar New Year cake. On this day last year, prices were rising daily, and each yuan could only buy about a pound (Ningbo New Year cake could get about two pounds). This year, due to the high price of rice, the high price of sugar, and the high cost of labor, the selling price is even more alarming. A pound of sugar New Year cake must be sold for $2.40 a pound in tea shops, and cake and dumpling shops are cheaper, but they must also sell for $2 or $1.92 a pound (and brown sugar and white sugar cannot be mixed). As for Ningbo New Year cake, only five or six pieces are sold for a dollar, or it costs $1.3-4 per market catty, which is more than twice as expensive compared to previous years, and more than ten times more expensive compared to before the war. On this day in previous years, tea shops and cake and dumpling shops already had piles of sugar New Year cake like mountains, and the New Year cake market was full of flowers. This year, it is cold and clear, with only a few pieces of sugar New Year cake, and the number is very small. The reason for this is that it is not easy to eat rice porridge (difficult and difficult to米), let alone New Year cake. Therefore, the New Year cake market only ends up being bleak and desolate, which is very pitiful.

Speaking of the manufacturing cost of sugar New Year cake, each catty costs about $1.50, and with the addition of profit, the market must add at least three or four cents, or even five or six cents, which is not surprising. The ingredients of New Year cake (glutinous rice and粳 rice) before the war were "seven glutinous and three粳," or "six glutinous and four粳," but now it is "half粳 and half glutinous" (and the粳 rice is mostly broken foreign rice, and the thin rice is extremely fresh). The status is getting worse year by year, and the selling price is getting higher year by year. The difficulty of life can be seen from this. Fortunately, New Year cake can be saved, but rice cannot be saved. However, it is difficult to buy rice, so although it cannot be saved, it must be saved. (Zhao)
