### Intensified Battle for Key Black Sea Port: Tank Battles Erupt as German Troops Face Bitter Conditions; Soviets Consolidate Positions Northwest of City

Stockholm, Sweden, 13th (Allied News Agency)

Fighting in Stalingrad continues in the city center. Yesterday's battles in the Caucasus were concentrated around the crucial mountain passes leading from Kuban to the Black Sea coast and Tuapse. According to Moscow sources, fierce struggles for these passes have been ongoing for over two weeks. The German command dispatched three rifle divisions and a Slovakian mechanized division, launching an attack under cover of smoke last night against Soviet lines, resulting in a large-scale tank battle that has lasted for thirteen hours without a clear victor. Berlin's communique only stated that a Soviet force was encircled and annihilated in the woods. The German communique also claimed that Soviet attempts south of Terek to obstruct the German advance were ineffective, with Soviet tank attacks repelled. Fighting in the Stalingrad area remains extremely intense, with Soviet offensives met by fierce German resistance and counter-attacks against localized Soviet concentrations. Increasingly severe weather is hindering operations for both sides.

Stockholm, Sweden, 13th (Allied News Agency)

General Rokossovsky, commander of the Stalingrad defense, is reportedly bolstering the city's defenses to counter the new offensive launched by German air and land forces near the Don River bend. Aerial combat in the area has been particularly intense in recent days.

Moscow, 12th (Havas News Agency)

The Soviet High Command has announced that in the past 24 hours, fierce fighting has taken place with enemy forces in the Stalingrad and Mozdok areas. No significant changes have occurred on other fronts. According to semi-official sources, Soviet forces in a sector of the Stalingrad front have lost some ground, but positions in the city's northwest suburbs have been consolidated.

Stockholm, Sweden, 13th (Havas News Agency)

Military observers here now state that, according to the latest reports from the Eastern Front, the Soviet port of Tuapse has become the primary objective of German forces in the Caucasus. After largely annihilating the Soviet 32nd Division yesterday, the German advance continues towards the port. Despite repeated setbacks, Soviet resistance remains strong. The Germans are encountering considerable difficulties, as even light mountain units require supply columns for artillery and essential materials, slowing their advance. All roads, paths, and mountain passes are blocked, and the Soviet-held cave systems must be systematically cleared. Before encircling the Soviet forces in the Fender Pass, the Germans must destroy over 400 emplacements. However, Soviet forces in the Terek River area have taken the initiative, launching repeated attacks on German positions. In the Stalingrad area, the Germans have redeployed large numbers of fresh troops, tanks, and aircraft, anticipating a renewed German offensive against the city in the very near future. However, fighting was completely suspended yesterday, as the German High Command needed to reorganize its units. The offensive by General Timoshenko's forces against German positions around Stalingrad has been successful, with several breakthroughs achieved in German lines. Red Army forces are consolidating positions on the east bank of the Don River to prevent further German attacks. The recent bloody Soviet offensive against Stalingrad has resulted in heavy losses, with casualties and prisoners estimated at no less than 250,000.

Berlin, 12th (Havas News Agency)

Well-informed sources here have provided the following analysis of the Eastern Front situation: (1) Recent heavy fighting has resulted in the capture of over 4,000 Red Army soldiers. Losses in the northwest Caucasus are estimated at between 8,000 and 10,000 Red Army soldiers killed or wounded, with the 32nd Division and mountain troops suffering the heaviest losses. (2) German rifle units in the same area continue to advance through the mountains towards the Black Sea port of Tuapse, sometimes having to cross valleys in wind, snow, and bitter cold. At the same time, German rear guards must clear the battlefield. Heavy German air raids continue to target Tuapse and nearby Red Army positions. Soviet communication lines have been severely disrupted, with damaged vehicles blocking roads. (3) The Leningrad area transportation lines have also been bombed by the German air force. (4) East of the Volga River, German bombers and dive bombers are attacking railway hubs, destroying trackside facilities and numerous trains. (5) On the Northern Front, the situation is quiet due to severe weather. German forces have occupied only one industrial town on Lake Ladoga.

Berlin, 13th (Haitong News Agency)

The battle for the Black Sea port of Tuapse has entered a decisive phase. After annihilating two enemy regiments and capturing about a thousand prisoners, German forces are pressing on towards the port despite the bitter cold. Hilly positions along the approaches to the city are now in German hands. German supply lines are now secure. The roads from Novorossiysk through Tuapse to Batumi are now under German fire and may soon be cut off. Coastal shipping routes along the Black Sea are gradually falling under the control of German naval forces. The Soviets, recognizing the seriousness of the situation, have launched several rescue offensives in recent days, all without success. In the Terek region, German aircraft have observed Soviet trains carrying railcars from the eastern Caucasus along the coast, via the Astrakhan railway, towards the interior. Small-scale skirmishes continue north of Stalingrad, while the Don region is relatively quiet, with only localized fighting.

### Taking Intelligence, Benevolence, Courage, and Discipline as the Basis for Personal Conduct: A Lecture at the Central Military Academy

Today, I will continue to explain the first, second and third articles of the Military Personnel Training Code for the Army, Navy, and Air Force. I've already lectured on them several times. Now, I'll discuss the fourth article: "Take intelligence, benevolence, courage, and discipline as the basis for personal conduct." First, I'd like to ask everyone: Why only intelligence, benevolence, courage, and discipline as the basis for personal conduct, and not others? I'll ask this question first and ask everyone to think about it.

What is intelligence? It is wisdom. What is benevolence? It is love. What is courage? It is bravery. Everyone knows this. Why don't we talk about benevolence, righteousness, propriety, wisdom, and trustworthiness, which are inherent to China? Why don't we take loyalty, filial piety, benevolence, love, trustworthiness, righteousness, and peace as the basis for a soldier's personal conduct? And why don't we use propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame, which were emphasized in the New Life Movement? Every time I raise a question, I ask everyone to think about it. I think it will be difficult for you to answer this question. I must explain it clearly to everyone because soldiers must have absolute faith in the training code. The more clearly it is explained, the more firmly you will believe in it.

None of the words mentioned above are bad. However, from a psychological perspective, the human spirit has three major elements: knowledge, emotion, and will. These three major elements of the spirit are like the people, land, and sovereignty of a nation, which are the three major elements of a nation. "Intelligence" refers to abundant knowledge. "Benevolence" refers to fervent emotion. "Courage" refers to firm will. Therefore, highlighting the three words intelligence, benevolence, and courage can encompass everything. All of the words mentioned above can be included in intelligence, benevolence, and courage, because the words mentioned above are nothing more than one, or a combination of two or three, of knowledge, emotion, and will. They are absolutely not outside of knowledge, emotion, and will. Therefore, they are not outside of intelligence, benevolence, and courage. In other words, they are nothing more than an analysis or synthesis of intelligence, benevolence, and courage.

The three words intelligence, benevolence, and courage are parallel and related. Let's take saving the nation as an example. When a person sees the danger of the nation and knows that they must find a way to save it, this is intelligence. When a person sees the danger of the nation and cannot bear not to save the nation from danger, this is benevolence. When a person has the determination to save the nation from danger and persists without turning back, this is courage. Therefore, intelligence, benevolence, and courage are parallel and related. One is indispensable. For example, parents can be said to be nothing but benevolent to their daughters. However, in the past, ordinary parents would consider their daughters' future when they were four or five years old and force them to bind their feet, regardless of their daughters' pain, making them disabled for life. Isn't this unkind? This is fundamentally unintelligent. Therefore, it can be seen that many people's hearts are originally benevolent, but because of unintelligence, they often do many unkind things. If a person has intelligence but is not benevolent, that is even worse because having intelligence without benevolence will definitely create many evils. This is a common occurrence in history and society.

Intelligence is knowledge, but knowledge is not easy. In "Knowing is Difficult, Acting is Easy," Dr. Sun Yat-sen repeatedly instructed us that knowing is difficult. Now, foreigners criticize our Chinese army, saying that Chinese soldiers are very brave in combat, their quality is very good, and they are very capable of enduring hardship, but it is strange that their knowledge is insufficient. I hope everyone pays special attention to this point. It is not enough to just have a conscience; you must also have ability. Therefore, everyone must study diligently. The courses that your instructors are teaching are what you urgently need to learn now. In the future, when you leave the school to serve the country, you will need even more knowledge. You must strive to learn at all times to increase your knowledge. Only with real knowledge will you not fall behind and will not fail in the future.

Now that the nation has reached this point, we must use knowledge to save the nation. What China lacks most is knowledge. What we must contribute to the nation is knowledge. Taking material properties as an example, new machines and new tactics are constantly being improved. If we do not have real knowledge, how can we keep up?

Benevolence is love. According to ancient teachings, "A benevolent person values others." The character "benevolence" consists of the radicals "person" and "two." This means that if there is only one person in the world, the word "benevolence" is not needed. If there are two or more people, the word "benevolence" is needed. Fundamentally, love starts with parental love, then extends to love of country, love of nation, and love of humanity. Why are we soldiers willing to contribute everything to the nation? Because we love it and want it to live. Because of our great love, we are not selfish and are willing to exchange our own lives for the life of the nation. The thought of love is the essence of benevolence, and risking our lives is courage. So it is said that the benevolent must have courage.

Courage is bravery, which is a firm will and is related to both intelligence and benevolence. If we have emotion and reason, we must also have a firm will. This firm will is courage. There is an old Chinese saying, "Warriors are not afraid of death," but I feel that just being unafraid of death is not enough. You must know why you are not afraid of death. Mencius said it well: "There are things that I desire more than life, and there are things that I hate more than death." If a person has a strong sense of responsibility, then dying occasionally does not matter. For example, a pilot is very brave when he gets on the plane before taking off. His bravery is to fulfill his responsibility. At that time, his mind is only focused on how to fulfill his responsibility, and he has long put life and death aside and does not think about it. What he thinks about is how to use his life to fulfill his mission. Death can only be used as the final means to fulfill his mission. This kind of fearlessness of death is true courage. It must be known that so-called courage is the courage of righteousness, not the courage of cruelty. Ordinary robbers who kill and set fires will still sing and remain calm when they are executed. Would you say they are brave? They are only cruelly brave, not the courage of righteousness. What we soldiers need is the courage of righteousness. This courage is born of benevolence. We are determined to contribute everything to the nation. Fulfilling our responsibilities is the expression of contributing everything to the nation. Therefore, we value responsibility more than life, so we are not afraid of death. This is the courage of righteousness, and this is what our soldiers call courage.

I have finished explaining the three words intelligence, benevolence, and courage. But I still want to ask everyone: If we have intelligence, benevolence, and courage, is that enough? Why do we need discipline? You must know that intelligence, benevolence, and courage are for personal cultivation, while discipline is for the training of groups. A sound soldier is not enough with just personal cultivation; they must also have group training. Discipline is that the group must be organized and disciplined. Every group, if its organization and discipline are not strict, is equal to no group. It must be known that it is not enough for just one person to have intelligence, benevolence, and courage; the entire group must have intelligence, benevolence, and courage. Therefore, the unintelligent, unbenevolent, and unbrave elements in the group must be corrected. Otherwise, they must be eliminated. This is not a matter of leniency. Being lenient to the unintelligent, unbenevolent, and unbrave is being cruel to the intelligent, benevolent, and brave. The role of discipline lies in this. All societies must be disciplined, and especially the military. If there is no discipline, having an army is worse than having no army. In short, intelligence, benevolence, and courage are for self-cultivation. Discipline is for the training of the group. Without discipline, the entire group will become unintelligent, unbenevolent, and unbrave. Discipline will make the entire group intelligent, benevolent, and brave. You must understand this principle.

I have finished explaining the word discipline, but I still want to ask everyone: Please think about it, the ancient Chinese general Sun Tzu said, "The general must be intelligent, trustworthy, benevolent, courageous, and disciplined." Why did our training code simply omit trust? Article One of our training code, “Be loyal and trustworthy and contribute everything to the country.” This is the highest principle. The oath of the Chinese United League is “Be trustworthy and loyal.” The national anthem is “Must be trustworthy and loyal.” According to ancient teachings, “A person’s word is his bond.” We say we will contribute everything to the country and mean it. That is a person’s word; otherwise, it is not a person’s word. This is the highest principle. With this highest principle, intelligence, benevolence, courage, and discipline can be taken as the basis for personal conduct with nothing more than a desire to contribute more and greater. Therefore, the word trust has not been omitted at all.

I have finished explaining "Take intelligence, benevolence, courage, and discipline as the basis for personal conduct," but there is one more word to explain: "basis." The character "basis" consists of "wood" with a stroke added below. It means the root. With intelligence, benevolence, courage, and discipline, it is like a tree with roots. Article Five and below are the collective expression of intelligence, benevolence, courage, and discipline, like a root with a trunk, a trunk with branches, branches with flowers, leaves, and fruit. Root and tip grow together in an orderly manner. Everyone must understand each word clearly and put each word into practice.

### President Roosevelt Delivers Fireside Chat; Contents Include Five Key Points Explaining Measures to Address Labor Shortages

Stockholm, Sweden, 13th (Allied News Agency)

According to a Washington report, based on impressions gained from his recent domestic tour, U.S. President Roosevelt delivered a radio address from the White House at 10 PM on the 12th, titled "Fireside Chat," explaining the domestic situation during wartime and measures to address the labor shortage crisis. The key points of his speech are five: (1) It may be necessary to propose a new conscription act to supplement labor on farms and factories. (2) To increase munitions production, workers should be prohibited from moving between factories, and factories should also be prohibited from moving workers between them. (3) Workers of conscription age should be prohibited from leaving farms and factories or will be replaced by men, women and children. (4) The government has instructed state education authorities to divide secondary school students into two categories, during the school term and during vacations, to enable them to engage in munitions production to assist the national war effort. (5) Some Americans are unwilling to hire women, blacks, or the elderly, but today, it is no longer permissible to adhere to such prejudices. Roosevelt also indicated that he would begin to expand human resources, stating that the government has established conscription offices throughout the country, assigning 24,500 staff. He then stated that the authorities find it difficult to employ domestic Japanese agricultural workers, so they have no choice but to conscript middle school students. Finally, he explained the overall war situation, stating that the Allied forces are continuing to fight from Finland to the islands of the eastern Mediterranean, with the theater of operations expanding daily and the situation quite intense, and that this is not only the case on the three continents of Europe, Asia, and Africa, but in all the waters of the world.

Lowering the Military Service Age to Meet Urgent Needs

Lisbon, 13th (Allied News Agency)

Washington Report: President Roosevelt indicated in his fireside chat last night that the minimum age for U.S. military service would be reduced from 20 to 18 years. President Roosevelt earnestly spoke of the war's demand on American manpower, saying: "I believe it will be necessary to lower the minimum age for conscription from 20 to 18." He said the number of women working in production plants in less than a year would be about equal to the number of men, and that a selective service system would be implemented on both farms and factories, or a law would need to be enacted. President Roosevelt also described his impressions of the American war effort during his recent visits to various parts of the country, and refuted U.S. newspaper criticisms of his secretiveness during his travels. In addition, he acknowledged that shipping was a major problem for the Allies, stating that ships were continuing to be sunk by the enemy in various parts of the world, but that the Allied ship production rate now exceeds the sinking rate.

### Churchill's Broadcast Speech Inspires National Morale; Replenishment of Ships Deemed a Major Current Issue; Earnestly Hopeful That Everyone Will Be United to Overcome This Crisis

Stockholm, Sweden, 13th (Alliance News Agency Dispatch)

British Prime Minister Churchill is currently staying in Edinburgh with US Ambassador to Britain, Winant. On the 12th, Mr. Churchill gave a speech there addressing the current world war situation to inspire the nation, generally stating that the war has now entered a period of extreme confusion and unfathomable depth. During this transition period, he earnestly hoped that the people would not change their will and spirit, but would devote all their strength to uniting and advancing, so as not to fail the expectations of us all. Although our environment is fraught with crises, the light of the future is truly boundless. Although the loss and replenishment of ships is still a major current issue for the United Nations, the rate of ship sinkings has been greatly reduced in August and September, while the number of new ships built is quite satisfactory, he said.

Lisbon, 13th (Alliance News Agency Dispatch)

British Prime Minister Churchill broadcasted to the nation yesterday, stating roughly that our failures are the stages of victory. When we calmly assess the gains and losses of both sides, we can see that we have reached a firm stage in the war process.

British Newspapers Criticize US Aid as Insufficient

Stockholm, Sweden, 13th (Haitong News Agency Dispatch)

The number of British people criticizing the inadequacy of American war material assistance is increasing daily, seemingly in response to the open letter in the American magazine *Life*, which stated that the United States is not fighting to maintain the British Empire. London newspapers accuse the United States of deliberately withholding war materials from being shipped to Britain. The *Sunday Express* even carried an appeal by Mr. Garvin titled "United Nations - Unite!", stating that London and Washington do not have a common strategic agreement, and that there is a fundamental lack of cooperation between the Allied countries. The *Daily Mail* once again advocated the establishment of an Allied General Staff to preside over the distribution of war materials, and strongly criticized the United States for withholding a large number of war materials, resulting in Britain's dangerous position. All of these indicate that the relationship between Britain and the United States has suddenly become tense due to the remarks in *Life* magazine.

### British Army to Launch Offensive Before Onset of Rainy Season in North Africa; Increased Frequency of Aerial Activity on Both Sides; Nine Air Raids on Malta in One Day

Berlin, 12th (Alliance News Agency Dispatch)

According to news from the North African front, the North African front has been in a stalemate for a long time. Until recently, aerial activity between the two armies has gradually increased, and a major development in the war situation is imminent. According to reconnaissance reports from the Axis air force, mechanized units are currently concentrated in the rear areas of the British army in the Qattara Depression and Alamein areas. The British artillery units are very active on the central and northern fronts. It is expected that the British North African Army Commander Alexander may take advantage of the favorable timing of the rainy season to launch a counter-offensive.

Rome, 12th (Havas News Agency Dispatch)

According to military observers here, the activity of the British army on the Egyptian front is gradually becoming tense. An offensive was launched in the center some days ago, but the German-Italian allied forces had a strong forward force and repelled it without using reserve troops. Although the British army was defeated, the Italian command is still paying close attention to the North African war situation. As for the British claims of attacking Alamein and raiding Tobruk and Jalo, and London even claiming that this was a preliminary test before the major battle, these are all exaggerations. According to Italian sources, the British army may launch a large-scale offensive in North Africa, although its purpose is limited to improving existing positions and may not have any great ambitions. In any case, the Axis command is waiting at ease and has the ability to control the overall situation. The fact that Generals Bastico and Rommel returned home together when the British side claimed a major offensive is quite worthy of consideration. In addition, the Axis air force has recently won several victories in North Africa, which is also a clear indication of the Axis's advantage. On the 9th of this month, Italian Macchi C.202 fighter planes attacked a British fleet of as many as 260 aircraft, resulting in 138 British aircraft being shot down in the morning and another 56 shot down in the afternoon.

Lisbon, 13th (Haitong News Agency Dispatch)

Axis aircraft repeatedly triggered air raid alarms over Malta yesterday, with a total of nine alarms. The air combat was extremely fierce.

Istanbul, 13th (Haitong News Agency Dispatch)

An air raid alarm was issued in Haifa yesterday. This was the first attack by enemy aircraft on the city in two months.

### Change of Command of German Garrison in Denmark; Danish Volunteers Go to Eastern Front

Copenhagen, Denmark, 13th (Haitong News Agency Dispatch)

It is declared here that the commander of the German forces in Denmark, General Lüttke, has been recalled and replaced by General Hanneken. Mr. Hanneken was originally the director of the Ministry of Economic Affairs and a prominent figure in the German economic world. He assisted General Göring in implementing the Four-Year Plan. General Lüttke has already set off to return to Germany some days ago after receiving the order. The German Minister to Denmark, Renthe-Fink, also returned with him to report on his duties.

Stockholm, Sweden, 13th (Havas News Agency Dispatch)

According to news from Copenhagen, Denmark, 800 volunteers from the country have returned from leave, and have already set off to return to the Eastern Front today. Before departing, they were reviewed by General Hanneken, the commander-in-chief of the German forces stationed in Denmark.

### Germany Mass-Producing Wartime Locomotives Equipped with Snow Protection Devices for Use on Eastern Front

Berlin, 13th (Haitong News Agency Dispatch)

German factories are now mass-producing wartime locomotives. The characteristics of these locomotives are simple design, saving raw materials and time, and equipped with snow protection devices for use on the Eastern Front. The German Ordnance Department began designing and building these locomotives in March 1942. The first locomotive traveled 5,000 kilometers with excellent results and has now begun mass production. The freight cars towed by the locomotives are also designed to meet the needs of the war. The weight of the freight cars is reduced, which can increase the weight of the cargo carried, with each car carrying five tons more, it is said.

### German Ambassador to Turkey, Von Papen, Returns to Post; Fierce German-British Competition for Turkish Chrome Production

Tokyo, 13th (Alliance News Agency Dispatch)

According to a dispatch from Istanbul, German Ambassador to Turkey, von Papen, arrived here on the 8th and then took a train east on the 9th, returning to Ankara on the 10th. It is expected that the reason for his hasty return is to exchange information and opinions with the Turkish government regarding the various situations during his absence. At the same time, due to the recent fierce competition among Germany, the United States, and Britain for the chrome ore issue, Turkey's chrome ore production is about 150,000 tons per year, accounting for one-sixth of the world's total production. Since the outbreak of this war, it has been the focus of competition among various countries. In 1940, Germany had already made representations to the Turkish government, requesting that all chrome ore sold to France in the past be purchased by Germany. However, since the establishment of the British-Turkish oil merchants agreement at the end of last year, the Turkish government has agreed to transfer the chrome sold to France to Britain, so all of this year's chrome production has gone to Britain, it is said.

### Japanese Invent New Method of Boiling Salt from Seawater

### Chilean President Suspends US Visit; US-Chilean Relations Suddenly Become Tense; Chile and Argentina Show No Intention of Taking Any Steps Against the Axis; Undersecretary Welles Rumored to Be Going to Canada on Official Business

Washington, 12th (Havas News Agency Dispatch)

Chilean President Ríos' abrupt postponement of his visit has greatly shaken people here. According to the Chilean Ambassador to the United States, Michels, this decision was communicated by President Ríos to himself, and by himself to President Roosevelt. The cable was of a private nature, so he did not intend to make a special visit to the White House or the State Department. At the same time, the State Department remained silent on the matter. The President's Press Secretary at the White House, Early, also refused to comment on the matter and instructed reporters to inquire with the State Department. Early also refused to comment on whether the White House had received a cable from Chilean President Ríos. It is generally believed that the US side will announce the reasons for this issue at Undersecretary Welles' next press conference. As for the political figures' criticism of Chile and Argentina's attitude in Undersecretary Welles' recent statement, it is considered to be the most severe criticism made by US government officials against its two neighboring countries. Newspaper editorials believe that President Ríos' cancellation of his trip to the United States proves that Chile has no intention of taking any steps against the Axis powers. The hope that Chile would break off relations with the Axis powers after President Ríos' visit to the United States has now been dashed. In the future, Chile and Argentina will probably continue to strictly adhere to a neutral stance. It is generally believed that the opinions on the entire incident should be communicated to the governments of Argentina and Chile in the form of a memorandum.

Rome, 12th (Havas News Agency Dispatch)

The Fascist Labor Daily recently reported that according to reliable sources, US Undersecretary of State Welles, who has always been in charge of Latin American affairs, may be sent to Canada on official business. This move is tantamount to removing him from his position as Undersecretary in order to ease the recent accusations against him by the governments of Chile and Argentina. The reason is that Welles had stated some days ago that Chile and Argentina refused to break off relations with the Axis powers, and then harbored Axis agents. The United States should blame them for the sinking of several of its ships by enemy submarines, etc. After this statement was issued, the relationship between the United States and Chile suddenly became tense. Chilean President Ríos' originally scheduled visit to the United States is also said to have been canceled as a result.

New York, 12th (Havas News Agency Dispatch)

After Chilean President Ríos canceled his trip to the United States, the *New York Times* wrote a special article commenting on it, stating roughly that there are now various reasons for the ruling officials to feel that it is now necessary to force the two remaining neutral countries in the Americas to state their positions. However, there is no doubt that Undersecretary Welles' criticism yesterday was too reckless, especially since Secretary of State Hull was not in Washington at the time, and Welles was speaking in his capacity as acting secretary. Therefore, the situation is even more serious. The State Department is well aware that the issuance of this statement on the eve of Chilean President Ríos' visit will inevitably cause dissatisfaction in Chile and Argentina. It can be seen that the authorities' move has a major reason, probably because they have no choice but to do so. For example, the appearance of Axis agents in various American countries is not only unwelcome to the United States, but also constitutes a major crisis for American shipping. At the same time, the State Department's issuance of an explicit statement to South American countries is probably intended to warn Argentina and Chile, dissatisfied with the neutral attitude of these countries. Such a view is enough to cause misunderstanding among other Latin American countries. These countries endure sacrifices and encounter dangers to provide the United States with assistance. If it is thought that other countries have not followed the policies of the Pan-American Conference in Rio de Janeiro, then there will be no way to do more to destroy American unity. In short, it is time to take urgent steps to consolidate the unity of the Americas and abandon slow diplomatic methods.

### Germany and Italy Are Watching the Development of This Matter

Bern, Switzerland, 12th (Havas News Agency Dispatch)

Recently, since US Undersecretary of State Welles made a speech criticizing the attitude of Chile and Argentina, the relationship between the United States and Chile has suddenly become tense. Newspapers in various countries are focusing on this matter. In addition to publishing this news on the front page, newspapers in Rome have also written many articles commenting on it. Newspapers in Berlin have also published this news in a prominent position. German officials are closely watching the development of this matter. According to news from Mexico City, political figures in the country did not feel surprised by Chilean President Ríos' cancellation of his visit to the United States, but semi-official sources believe that Welles' speech only facilitates the Axis powers, and there is indeed a sense of regret.

The Anti-Air Raid Section of the Shanghai Municipal Council's Police Department recently issued a serious warning to residents of this city, stating that a blackout drill will be held again in the near future. Therefore, each household must be prepared to have all the necessary black lamp shades, curtains, and yellow sand ready for use in case of emergency.

### Immediately Report Butchers Charging Above the Limit; Cooperate with Police to Ensure Price Limits Are Achieved

A spokesperson for the French Concession Police Department recently disclosed that the official prices for pork, beef, and mutton in the French Concession are the same as the price limits announced by the Public Concession, and urged the public to assist in strictly enforcing these official prices. Immediately report to the police if you encounter a butcher charging above the limit or refusing to sell. According to the spokesperson, the public invariably does not report to the police when they encounter situations such as charging above the limit, and only complains on their own, which is very regrettable. The police are currently doing their best to assist the citizens, so the citizens should also assist the police. Anyone who encounters a butcher charging too much for meat and is unwilling to bother reporting to the police is actually detrimental to themselves and the public. Because reporting to the nearest police station or officer can force the butcher to sell at the official price.

### Foreigners Traveling in the Streets Should Carry Identification Documents for Inspection by Japanese Military Police

Starting from the afternoon of the 12th, Japanese military police have been inspecting the identification documents of foreign residents and citizens traveling along Avenue Joffre. According to Lieutenant Matsuda, assistant spokesperson of the Japanese Army Information Department, all foreigners residing in Shanghai must carry a residence permit when traveling in the city. If the residence permit has not been issued by the relevant authorities in the area where they reside, they should carry a passport or other proof of identity.

All Foreigners Must Comply

This statement is addressed to all foreigners, not just Allied nationals. It is said that the Japanese military police stationed at various locations in the city will instruct all foreigners passing in front of them to show their identification documents in the future. Therefore, Axis nationals who do not have a residence permit should also carry proof of identity. At the same time, since the preparation for issuing residence permits to foreigners in the Western District has not been completed, foreigners in the Western District should carry passports or other identification documents in order to pass through certain locations in the city.

Enemy Aliens Must Wear Armbands

It is also said that the French Concession authorities recently collected residence permits from foreigners in the Concession to modify them, and have already reissued all of them. The Public Concession has also collected foreign residents' permits to modify them, but has not yet collected all of them, and has not stipulated a deadline. It is said that the purpose of the Japanese military police instructing foreigners to show their identification documents in the future is to determine whether all Allied nationals have obtained the red armband and are wearing it on their left arm in accordance with the regulations.

### Registration for Fujian Compatriots Returning to Their Native Place

### Banking and Financial Firms Allow Flexible Extension of Credit Loan Repayments Due at the End of the Tenth Month; Money Brokers to Hold Internal Meeting in Three Days

Banking and financial firms are aware that the date for credit loans to Shanghai industrial and commercial businesses due at the end of the tenth month is approaching. They are preparing to collect long-term credit loans and new goods. Factories, companies, and firms are all mobilizing funds to repay credit loans that are due, and are contacting banking and financial firms to extend old loans and release new goods. The principles for new credit loans for each banking and financial firms are to increase interest rates, establish contracts, and ensure solid guarantees. Although flexible extensions have been allowed for loans that have expired, the interest that is due must be paid in full. New credit loan contracts must be established, and interest rates must be negotiated separately. Although regulations stipulate that the issue of raising interest rates should be decided by each banking and financial firm with reference to the market on the island, the monthly outstanding interest rates announced have now been raised, so the interest rate on credit loans is approximately between 20 and 25 yuan per month. The term of the credit loan is six months, until the end of April next year.

### Announcement of the Third Readers' Scholarship Examination Questions

The third *Shen Bao* Readers' Scholarship program was completely concluded some months ago. In addition to reviewing the qualifications in accordance with the conventions of the previous two sessions, the process adopted an examination system. The purpose of holding the identification examination is based on the experience of the newspaper's colleagues in handling the scholarship work in the past two sessions. It is deeply felt that the strictness and leniency of the grades set by schools at all levels in Shanghai for students' coursework vary greatly. It is difficult to be fair to the review of grades based solely on a single transcript. Therefore, we had to adopt the method of identification. The tests were divided into three groups: elementary school, junior high school, and senior high school. Graduates from elementary school were placed in junior high school, and teachers graduating from junior high school were placed in senior high school. Although there was a difference of two or three school years in terms of level, the test questions for each group included the curriculum of each grade in that group. The scoring standard was also based on the topics of each grade and subject in each group and the academic qualifications of each person. The following is an excerpt of the examination questions for each group for the reference and testing of students in each school.

### Needy Students Require Meal Subsidies; Society's Donations Urgently Needed; Families Far Away, Meals Insufficient; Helping Within One's Means is an Unavoidable Responsibility

Since the YMCA launched the meal subsidy campaign for needy students, a large number of needy students from various schools have applied to register. To ensure prudence, in addition to detailed inquiries, strict investigations are conducted to ensure that relief is fair and necessary.

Needy Children Wait Helplessly for Aid

Eighty to ninety percent of the students applying this year are from impoverished families. Their families are not in Shanghai, and their living conditions are extremely simple. It is difficult to even provide three meals a day, let alone nutrition and hygiene. If each person is subsidized eighty yuan per month, and each semester is calculated as four months, each person needs three hundred and twenty yuan. Assuming there are one hundred fifty to sixty students, at least fifty thousand yuan is needed. Donations are still short by half, and it is hoped that enthusiastic people from all walks of life will complete this undertaking in the near future, so that all applications can be approved. This is also a duty that the people of Shanghai should fulfill.

List of Donations

The list of donations received by the YMCA is recorded below: Shen Feng Company: 1,000 yuan; Ji Feng Tang: 1,000 yuan; Lian Ji: 1,000 yuan; St. John's University: 1,000 yuan; Qiao Tianqing: 200 yuan; Shou Ji: 200 yuan; Wei Ji: 100 yuan; Lu Shoulun: 100 yuan; Lu Meiseng: 100 yuan; Yu Yichen (Songjiang): 150 yuan; Jin Jun: 50 yuan; Shi Meiqing: 100 yuan. The above totals 5,000 yuan in Central Reserve Bank notes. Other donations will be reported later.

### Continued Generous Donations: Chen Yanyitang's Two Charitable Acts

This newspaper received a second donation of 10,000 yuan from Chen Yanyitang yesterday for education assistance. The earnest assistance to education and the benefit to needy students are worthy of admiration. On September 21 of this year, Chen Yanyitang generously donated 5,000 yuan for the first time. Now, less than a month later, another large donation has been made, demonstrating a sincere and profound intention and sympathy for the poor. On behalf of the YMCA students, this newspaper expresses its gratitude upon receiving this surplus. Yesterday, the amount of aid received was: Chen Yanyitang (second donation) 10,000 yuan. Previous balance: 80,845.92 yuan. Total balance: 90,845.92 yuan.

### The Chinese Moral Instruction Association Will Start Winter Relief Early

In addition to providing porridge every afternoon, the association is also actively rushing to make winter clothing, each set costing forty yuan, and porridge tickets, each book costing ten yuan, so that people from all walks of life can easily purchase and donate them. Please call 37819. The more charitable acts there are, the greater the expenditures. Kind people from all walks of life can send their donations to the Charity Department of the association.

### The Municipal Council and Others Will Discuss the 24-Hour System

Regarding the issue of adopting a 24-hour system in this port, a roundtable conference will be held by representatives from the Japanese Consulate, the Municipal Council, the Japanese Residents Association, and other organizations to discuss it. This roundtable conference was initiated by Japanese organizations. The organization held a meeting on the afternoon of the 12th, and the meeting resulted in a decision to require that this 24-hour system also be common among Chinese citizens. At the same time, according to the Japanese Residents Association, the decision was made to expand this system, and the Central China Railway Company has already applied this new system.

### The French Concession Civil Police Will Increase Booths

Residence Permits to be Issued by Year-End

The police booths of the Baojia Civil Police Corps in the French Concession have been installed. The total number is 200. In addition to the important locations in various districts, there are many locations with wooden signs indicating the positions of the Civil Police Corps. Each joint Baojia has convened meetings and submitted written requests to the French Police Authority to increase the number of police booths. Regarding residence permits, 90% have been issued in the Xiaodongmen district. The rest are being rushed to be completed by the end of the year. The Civil Police armbands have been standardized and are all produced and distributed by the police station.

### The Entire North Suzhou Road is Now Open to Traffic

The barbed wire nets in the Jiangxi Road area have all been removed. North Suzhou Road, from Xinlaji Bridge in the west to Waibaidu Bridge in the east, is now open to traffic. A gap has been opened in the barbed wire net set up at the northern end of the Waterworks Bridge to allow pedestrian traffic. However, vehicles are still prohibited from passing. It is heard that it is no longer necessary to go around Sichuan Road Bridge from the north of Tianhou Palace Bridge to the Postal Bureau Building and that North Suzhou Road can be directly accessed.

### The Remaining Deposit Balance in Zhejiang Can Be Fully Withdrawn

Those Over Fifty Yuan Still Handled According to Regulations

After the Shanghai branches of the Zhejiang Provincial Bank, Jiangsu Bank, Jiangxi Yumin Bank, and other banks were ordered to suspend operations and be liquidated, the supervisory officer approved the repayment of deposits to depositors starting October 5. (1) Zhejiang Provincial Bank announced yesterday: "Regarding various deposits in this bank, for those with an original deposit amount of 5,000 yuan or less, in addition to the first installment already withdrawn, the remaining balance can be fully withdrawn in one lump sum starting today. This is hereby announced for your information.

(2) The first installment withdrawal for Jiangsu Bank depositors is limited to 300 yuan in Central Reserve Bank notes per account. The bank is making efforts to collect outstanding loans to conclude business. The date and method of the second installment withdrawal will be announced soon. (3) After the Jiangxi Yumin Bank suspended operations, all deposits were repaid separately. The total amount of deposits is now less than 30,000 yuan in Central Reserve Bank notes. There are no depositors with more than 5,000 yuan, so there are no restrictions on depositors' withdrawals. They are allowed to withdraw the full amount in one lump sum.

### The Hongying Library Will Open Tomorrow

The Hongying Library at 1413 Avenue Joffre, French Concession, has a very extensive collection of books and magazines. It is heard that for the convenience of reading, it has been officially opened since the 15th after the Double Ten Festival.

To provide preferential treatment to readers, the fees have been temporarily reduced by half.

### Impersonating Fire Brigade Staff to Intimidate Shops into Buying Fire Extinguishers

The hooligans Gu Liangen (23 years old, Ningbo native) and Hu Songhe (25 years old, Shaoxing native) pretended to be staff from the Loukazai Fire Brigade in the French Concession on the afternoon of the previous day. They went to the Qiaofeng Tailor Shop at 57 Rue Amiral Bayle and made intimidating statements, falsely claiming, "We have been ordered to come and investigate why the shop has not purchased fire extinguishers. If you don't comply, you will be severely fined. However, if we purchase them on your behalf, the price will be cheap and the quality will be excellent. Each unit is priced at 190 yuan." They instructed the shop owner to pay immediately. Fortunately, the shop owner noticed the flaw and secretly sent an apprentice to report to the Detective Office. Detective Yin Baoke was dispatched to arrest Gu and Hu and take them to the Detective Office for interrogation. They confessed to impersonating the staff and extorting money. The chief ordered them to be detained to investigate whether they had committed other crimes before handing them over to the court.

### The Shanghai Epidemic Hospital Epidemic Department Will Close Tomorrow

### The Xin Ningshao Steamer Will Resume Sailing Today

The steamer is scheduled to resume sailing to Ningbo today. During the suspension period, the Changshan Maru replaced the schedule. Since the Xin Ningshao Steamer has been repaired and is running, the Changshan Maru returned to Shanghai the day before yesterday and immediately suspended operations.

### The Bureau is Still Studying Adding Place Names to Stamps

According to a Datong News Agency reporter, the Shanghai Postal Administration is still studying the matter of adding place names to stamps. The postal authorities are currently studying whether it is more appropriate to print "Limited to Shanghai, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang" or "Hubei" on the stamps, or to print "Shanghai, Nanjing, Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Anhui, Hubei," etc., to distinguish postal areas. As a result, the implementation period has been delayed.

The most difficult problem of the venue has also been solved. The association has obtained the approval of the authorities to use the Racecourse grounds on three sides (i.e., 1, 2, and 5). Jiaozhou Park Stadium has also been designated as the association's venue. A total of four venues have been scheduled to be allocated to the association starting from the 17th of this month until the end of next season's league. However, Yiyuan Stadium has decided not to open this season. The Western League Football Tournament will kick off this week. The association has scheduled two friendly matches in the following order: (1) Saturday: Western Public School vs. St. Francis (Group B), starting at 3:00 PM at Racecourse Field 5. (2) Sunday: Portugal vs. Italian Navy (Group A), starting at 3:00 PM at Racecourse Field 2.

### Tongren Cup Charity Table Tennis Tournament: Postal Service Wins Overall Third Place

Defeats Lianqing 5-2

The final for the overall third place in the Tongren Cup Shanghai Charity Table Tennis Championship was held at the Haig Road Western Police Gymnasium at 7:00 PM last night. The Postal Service, the runner-up in Group A, competed against Lianqing, the runner-up in Group B. More than 600 spectators were present, and the atmosphere was enthusiastic. Postal Service players Wang Huizhang and Zhuang Kunrong were absent, and only six players participated. Lianqing had a rare opportunity, but they lacked a coach to tactically avoid strengths and attack weaknesses, and instead put their main players at the end, which was broken by the Postal Service one by one. Liu Zaoshi, Zhu Longli, and Chen Wensheng played very hard and won successively. Li Guangyao happened to encounter Hu Yuansui, who had mediocre skills, and won 3-0, laying the foundation for the Postal Service's victory. In the sixth game, Lianqing's main player Huang Yuxi played against Jiang Chunshan. The battle was fierce and the performance was wonderful. As a result, the two fought a five-game battle. Postal Service's Jiang Chunshan won with a steady smash, securing the final victory. As a result, the Postal Service defeated Lianqing 5-2 to win the overall third place. The scores of the two teams are as follows:

(Postal Service) (Lianqing) Score

Liu Zaoshi Shen Zhongshu 3-2

Ye Xiuzhang Tang Peifeng 1-3

Zhu Longli Gao Houkun 3-0

Chen Wensheng Zhang Liangfu 3-0

Li Guangyao Hu Yuansui 3-0

Jiang Chunshan Huang Yuxi 3-2

### Due to the Inspiration of This Newspaper, a Free Folding Bicycle Was Invented (2)

I believe that the ladies who drive bicycles must have felt the above shortcomings of bicycles and at the same time believe that the designers of bicycles must also be considering the ladies from all walks of life and are trying their best to improve.

Of course, the Asia Bicycle Factory at 95 Hartung Road in this port recently invented a travel-type free folding bicycle that solves the above shortcomings of bicycles. This is indeed a great contribution.

The greatest advantages of the free folding bicycle are (1) it can be folded up and carried around when necessary, and it does not take up space when stored (2) the bicycle can be used by both men and women (3) the modified air cushion makes the driving ladies comfortable and without bumps and pain. As for the beauty of the style and the height of the bicycle, etc., it also meets the conditions.

The folding of the free folding bicycle is very simple. When the method is skilled, it only takes one minute to fold it up. As for changing from a men's style to a women's style or a women's style to a men's style, it only takes a wave of the hand.

The method of folding the free folding bicycle is to first remove the handlebar (it can be obtained by turning a knob), then loosen the bicycle chain and remove the head of the upper crossbar under the seat and install it in the designated place on the foot pedal to form a women's bicycle (it can be obtained by lifting a spring), and then fold it up and tighten the screw in the center of the wheel axle so that it will not separate and use the bicycle stand as a handle to carry it around. If you want to change from a men's style to a women's style, you only need to loosen the middle spiral of the bicycle stand and move the bicycle stand down to widen the bicycle body, or if you want to change from a women's style to a men's style, you can restore it according to the above method.

The bicycle has been on display in the windows of The Sun Company since the day before yesterday. In the past two days, nearly 10,000 people have visited it, which shows that the bicycle is attracting attention.

The motive for the design engineer of the Asia Bicycle Factory to research and develop the free folding bicycle was based on the inspiration of the shortcomings of bicycles published in this newspaper half a year ago. It is heard that the factory has submitted the three major characteristics of the bicycle for patent to prevent the imitation of bicycle merchants and plans to expand the factory to meet the needs of the market and is also engaged in designing to reduce the weight of the bicycle and the replacement of the bicycle chain, etc. (to be continued)

### Government Bonds Surge in Selling Pressure, Suddenly Down More Than Three Yuan

The over-the-counter trading of government bonds was still very strong yesterday. The market price was depressed due to the news of new chips entering the market. Selling pressure surged, and the market price suddenly fell by more than three yuan. It can be seen that the excessive price rebound was also fierce. Although rumors were rampant in the market, they were still not seen. In the end, it is still far from the rumors. Otherwise, breaking 60 yuan cannot be said to be small. Class C initially traded down one yuan and several jiao, opening at 4.5 yuan, reaching a high of 4.8 yuan, and then fell all the way down, with a small price seeing 2.5 yuan, and then slowly returning to the top, finally 3.2 yuan, down 2.7 yuan.

Eastern Cloth

The price began to rise and then weakened. After the noon closing, due to the continued rise in yarn prices, various cloths followed suit. 12-pound Dragon Head Fine Cloth New Single was 170 yuan, and finally 171 yuan, with demand exceeding supply. Bank Single Dragon Head was popular, with 161.75 yuan, and Colored Ball was 160.5 yuan, both up 5 jiao per bolt.

### A Record After Watching "The Peacock Flies Southeast"

— Master of the Plum Blossom Hall

"The Peacock Flies Southeast" is a uniquely famous script of the Beiping Opera School. Before Hou Yulan graduated, she once starred in this play, playing the lead role of Liu Lanzhi. Her singing and acting were excellent, and she enjoyed a great reputation at the time. However, due to ranking limitations, none of the three southern tours fully presented this play. Not only did Yulan herself feel unhappy, but also the Shanghai audience felt it was a pity. When Wu Suqiu first came to Shanghai, she also promoted herself with this play, and her performance was

quite successful.

The "Weaving Donation" scene was particularly brilliant. However, the role of Jiao Zhongqing was changed to be played by the young actor Zhou Weijun. Zhao Jinrong also performed this play once after Wu Suqiu. Due to the lack of inner performance, she failed to fully convey the key points of the play. Although there were no major errors, it was still slightly inferior compared to Suqiu. Wang Yurong also once performed this play in the old capital, but the name of the play was changed to "Jiao Zhongqing and Liu Lanzhi" because Yurong was not a student of the opera school and the script was purchased from outside, so she had to make this change to avoid friction with the opera school. However, the new name of "Jiao Zhongqing and Liu Lanzhi" always felt

a bit awkward

to the ear. Yurong has already performed this play here and has restored the original name of "The Peacock Flies Southeast." On the night of the performance, I was planning to go and see it, but I was unable to do so due to temporary matters. When there is another opportunity, I will definitely steal some time to go and see it to compare the differences between Yurong and Suqiu's performances. On the night of the ninth of this month, Li Yuzhi suddenly performed this play. It lasted for more than two hours, from 8:10 PM to 10:20 PM. The performances in the second scene, the whipping, the weaving in the machine room, and the fifth scene, the enduring humiliation and remarriage, were the most brilliant. This play has a lot of singing. The "Erhuang Manban" during the weaving scene has several lines that are very similar to Yanqiu's "Tears in the Wilderness", which are gentle and melancholy, with

limitless sorrow.

"In my maiden home, I learned the konghou and studied books, knowing etiquette. Entering the Jiao family, I often weave at the cold loom alone at night, sleeping late, and I must get up when the rooster crows. Day after day, night after night, from morning till dusk, there is no rest forever." These four beautiful lines are stacked almost one sentence after another. After the lanterns are lit, she sings the "Kuai Sanyan": "Every day I work hard in the machine room, hoping that he will keep his chastity and be determined." These six lines are like the mourning of a cuckoo, a weeping widow, with sad sounds in every sentence and blood and tears in every word. I was particularly moved by this play, and it was truly unbearable to listen to. The lantern posture is also

very beautiful.

The expression when she was forced to return home was also excellent. On the one hand, she dared not disobey her mother-in-law's orders, and on the other hand, she did not want to separate from her husband Jiao. On the other hand, she also had to consider her shame and how to face her mother and brothers. All kinds of complex emotions were conveyed in the words "My husband, don't cry, I have a plan." Yuzhi's performance here was indeed particularly outstanding. Finally, in the garden, in the scene of farewell to Jiao Lang forever, she sang two sections of "Erliu Kuaiban", which were as fast as scissors and as crisp as an Asian pear, showing her deep skills. The entire performance from beginning to end had no slackness or carelessness. It is appropriate for the audience to listen attentively and repeatedly applaud. Ci Shaoquan's portrayal of Jiao's mother as a vicious mother-in-law was vivid and lively, adding a lot of color to the whole play. Guan Dexian's Jiao Zhongqing was also an experienced actor. In the fifth scene, the questioning of Liu Lanzhi was both vocal and expressive, especially sharp and precise. Sun Jianqiu's younger sister was also quite competent, only the dialogue was slightly unfamiliar, and with practice, she would also be a good supporting role.

### Review of "The Widows' Home"

— Chen Cunren

In the Chinese literary world, there are very few female writers, and only one or two have been successful. In the current drama world, there is a severe shortage of scripts. Unexpectedly, Ms. Xia Xia came up with a self-written, self-directed, and self-acted play. Those who know the difficulties inside will all hold their breath. Failure is expected.

After reading half of the script of "The Widows' Home" in a magazine, I already knew that it was well-written. After going to Lihua to watch it once, I found three miracles: (1) The clues in the script are novel and interesting. In the Widows' Home, because they are afraid of cats calling in spring, they prohibit raising cats, which leads to poisoning rats, which then leads to two widows committing suicide, symbolizing that the cats are not calling in spring. This ingenious idea is indeed Xia Xia's inspiration. In fact, how could chastity halls not raise cats? (2) The central idea of the whole play is that the founder wants a chastity archway. This wish has buried the harmony and spirit of many women and maintained a harsh traditional system for men. The play ridicules the sense of justice of the director and the authorities on Chastity Avenue, which is written very powerfully. (3) Several climaxes in the play, such as Jieyu being severely punished by her father and the director snatching an illegitimate child, can grasp the emotions of the entire theater audience, making the tragic atmosphere not dull and making the audience's will follow the playwright's will to express deep sympathy for Jieyu. These are all the successes of the playwright.

The best acting performance in "The Widows' Home" is Wang Zhen in the first performance. I think everyone will admit this. Wang Zhen's attitude is relaxed and interesting, and she performed the eight words of "charming, innocent, bold, brave, and decisive" to the point of saturation. The role of Wang Zhen is the second protagonist of the whole play, and she has more scenes than the first protagonist. The director takes the risk of the success or failure of the whole play and boldly uses a newcomer. This is the success of the director.

Xia Xia's personality is not suitable for playing this role because the original Lanlan did not participate, and a strong, rebellious character is playing a weak, sacrificial victim without resistance, so she cannot give full play to her acting talent.

I think Xia Xia's self-written and self-directed "The Widows' Home" is a success. Although she did not fail in acting, she did not achieve a high level of success.

(Editor's Note) Dr. Cunren does not often watch plays, let alone review them. This time, he suddenly took time out of his busy schedule to watch a play and write a review. Although it is a short piece, it is written very skillfully. We admire it and add a few words as an introduction.

### Lin Tong and Wang Yurong Cooperate

— Conscience

The plays performed by Empress Theater with Wang Yurong, Zhou Xiaotian, Wu Yanheng, Gao Weilian and other actors are very satisfactory. The entire troupe will perform until the 25th of this month. The initial plan is to have Jin Shaoshan, Zhang Shuxian, Chen Shaolin, Li Duokui, Zhang Chunyan, etc. Jin Shaoshan's representative Sun Huanru has already negotiated with the Empress Theater to finalize the third batch of actors to come to Shanghai. All procedures have been completed. Sun returned to Peiping on the morning of the 13th to report back. The second batch of actors in the theater is scheduled to be headed by Lin Tong. The salary is based on the number of performances, setting a new record in the Liyuan world. Because of the good public opinion of the female lead Wang Yurong, it would be a sensation in Shanghai if she cooperated in "Xue Pinggui and Wang Baochuan" and played one person to the end. The young actor Gao Weilian, the painted face Qiu Shengrong, and the old male lead are still being sought after.

Wang Naidong has returned to Shanghai and will join the China United Film Company. All the filmmakers who stayed in Hong Kong are safe. Wang Yuanlong, Zhou Wenzhu, etc. will also come to Shanghai together. The film queen Hu Ze once took refuge in Macau and may transfer to the mainland.

After the trilogy of "Important Events in Life" by Hua Yi, there was once talk of performing matinee shows at the Empress Theater, but recently it has almost dissolved invisibly. The talk of Yao Ke being taken over by Pan has not yet approached.

Gai Jiaotian's joining Golden has been finalized, but it is difficult to arrange the repertoire with three top stars crammed together. The situation of Wu Suqiu and Ye Shengzhang has already made the advertisers rack their brains. Gai Jiaotian has a legal provision that he does not hang the second sign with the surname Zhang, so the repertoire for the first day came up with a "Da Ming Mansion" with "An Arrow's Revenge". Everyone is the protagonist and everyone is the top star, which can be described as painstakingly planned.

Zhu Shilin has a large amount of coffee. Recently, he is working on the sister film of "Good Night and Flowers", "Sisters Competing for Love" (with Chen Yunshang playing both sisters), and he has coffee in his hand every day.

Shi Tuo's "Great Circus" is a rare masterpiece after transformation. Shi Hui's Murong Tianxi and Commissioner Liang also achieved success, but the makeup of these two figures is very subtle.

### Sharing the Same Boat Through Storms

— He Jia Zhi

(10) Flying Peak

Huanglong Cuizhen recaptured the Shide Hall. He came to the Ye family, but he did not know him, did not know the cold wind, did not know the dark night, and did not know what danger was. He put Cuizhen down by the Ye family's fence and said, "Isn't this refreshing? I was worried about you falling two or three somersaults on the road. The fence door is half-covered, and a small door around the west side of the house is also half-covered. The door creaked open, and the magpie inside waited in the dark and asked, "Is it Young Master Huang? Are you back?" Huanglong said, "I'm back." The magpie said, "Is Miss Cuizhen back?" Huanglong shouted, "Don't you know about the young lady and the young master? Why don't you even light a lamp?" Cuizhen said from behind, "Magpie, I'm back. Where is Madam? Where is Young Acorn?" The magpie turned the wick of a kerosene lamp, and the lamp lit up. She brought the lamp straight to Cuizhen and laughed, "Miss Cuizhen, you're back. I'm so happy. Young Master Huang is really capable." Huanglong said, "Stop talking, come with me." Huanglong walked to the patio and saw that Weicheng's bedroom was revealing light. At the same time, Ye's second wife was calling, "Who is talking?" Huanglong and Cuizhen hurriedly walked in. Cuizhen called out "Second Aunt", wanting to call out "Brother Cheng" again, but no matter what, she could not call it out. Her eyelids were wet, and she looked at Weicheng lying on the bed with her nostrils, folded her hands on her face, and sobbed.

Weicheng raised his face slightly and smiled reluctantly. "Sister Cuizhen is really back. I really feel grateful to him." He couldn't go on. Huanglong said, "Why is everyone so sad? If we don't see each other, everyone will miss each other. If we see each other, we will be sad again. Then what should we do?" Ye's second wife walked up, touched Cuizhen's head, and smiled, "Cuizhen, look at your Brother Cheng. He hasn't smiled for a day since you disappeared. He's sick, but he's not too sick. He refuses to eat. He asks his mother-in-law to talk all day long. If you cry again, his tears will not be less than yours." Cuizhen lifted the corner of the cheongsam and wiped her face and smiled, "Who is crying? I'm not crying. I only rejoice when I see the second wife and Brother Cheng. Haha, I'm laughing." Huanglong also laughed, "That's right. Is there wine? I want to drink. I just drank northwest wind, now I should drink wine." (202)
