### Seventeen Days of Ups and Downs in Sino-Polish Relations; British-Indian Negotiations in Deadlock; The Sticking Point Remains the Defense Issue; Acharya and Others Return to Calcutta

New Delhi, 11th (Reuters) – Sir Stafford Cripps' negotiations with the Indian National Congress lasted seventeen days, during which there were repeated ups and downs, sometimes optimistic and sometimes pessimistic. In the end, no agreement could be reached. The main sticking point was the transfer of control over India's defense. It is reported that the two sides could have reached an agreement on the control of India's defense during the negotiations, namely, India's defense would be jointly managed by an Indian Defense Minister and the British Commander-in-Chief. The original proposal stipulated that the adjustment of defense issues and military issues that were not of a technical nature should be the responsibility of the Indian Defense Committee. The British Commander-in-Chief would retain full authority over military strategy and operations. The Indian National Congress was not entirely satisfied with this proposal, but was still willing to reach an understanding during the war, subject to one condition: that after the cessation of military action, the Commander-in-Chief's authority should be transferred to the Defense Committee. It is reported that the British response indicated that the complete transfer of the Commander-in-Chief's authority to Indian control would have to wait until the establishment of a new Indian federation. The Indian National Congress was unwilling to accept this. It is reported that the Indian National Congress submitted a final response to Cripps, listing fifteen reasons. The response stated that if the central government was indeed a national government implementing a cabinet responsible system, and not merely an expansion of the Governor-General's Executive Council, then the Indian National Congress was prepared to come forward and take power. The various stages of this negotiation can be summarized as follows: the Indian National Congress passed a resolution advising Indians not to accept the British government's draft declaration; Cripps, together with President Roosevelt's personal representative Johnson, revised the original proposal; and finally, the Indian National Congress submitted a response. It is reported that these documents will be published on the 5th. The two sides also failed to agree on other points. For example, the Indian National Congress demanded that the guidance of the Secretary of State for India should be completely removed in practice, and that the Indian Governor-General, with the consent of more than half of the cabinet, should have no veto power. In addition, there was the issue of joint cabinet responsibility.

New Delhi, 11th (Reuters) – Indian National Congress President Acharya and the Standing Committee members are scheduled to leave here today. Nehru plans to stay for a few more days.

Washington, 11th (Havas) – There is great disappointment here after learning that the Indian National Congress has rejected the British proposal. However, semi-official sources are unwilling to comment until Sir Stafford Cripps delivers a broadcast speech clarifying his final position. Congressman Bloom, Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, hopes that the British and Indian sides will ultimately reach a compromise.

### Content of the Resolution of the Indian National Congress Party

New Delhi, 11th (Telegram) – The main resolution of the Indian National Congress Party rejecting the British plan stated that the Standing Committee had given very earnest and detailed consideration to the British War Cabinet's proposals regarding India and Sir Stafford Cripps' explanations. After referring to the defense issue, the resolution continued, "The British War Cabinet's proposals mostly concern future events after the cessation of hostilities. The Committee is well aware that the principle of self-determination for the people of India in the indefinite future has been accepted. However, it is regrettable that this self-determination is subject to restrictions, and there are certain conditions that seriously jeopardize the development of any free and united national government and the establishment of a democratic country. The participation of non-representative elements in the constitutional body harms the people's autonomy. The entire people of India have clearly demanded complete independence, and the Congress Party has repeatedly declared that no status other than the complete independence of India is acceptable, nor can it meet the fundamental needs of the current situation. The Committee recognizes that the proposal contains future independence, but the attached conditions and restrictions make true freedom an illusion. Completely ignoring the 90 million people of India and treating them as commodities in the hands of the rulers is a denial of democracy and self-determination. The representatives of the various states of India participate in the constitutional body, and it is stipulated according to the basis of the people. However, the people of the various states have no right to choose their representatives to speak, and they are not consulted when deciding on events that greatly affect them. These native states are sufficient to hinder the growth of Indian freedom in many ways, and they are surrounded by foreigners who are still in power, and in areas where it is possible to maintain foreign troops, the freedom of these native states and the rest of the people of India is infinitely threatened. As for the peculiar principle of pre-accepting that any province can refuse to participate, it is a serious blow to the unity of India and will produce disharmonious fruits, and will cause turmoil in the various provinces, making it more difficult for the various states of India to form a federation. The Congress Party has dedicated itself to the freedom and unity of India. Destroying unity is harmful to all concerned. Even thinking about it is extremely painful. The Congress Party certainly does not want to force any territorial unit to stay in the Indian Federation against its determined will. However, the Committee feels that all efforts should be made to create conditions that help each unit develop a life of common cooperation. Defense is an extremely important point, especially during wartime. At this stage, removing defense from the scope of Indian responsibility means that this responsibility is only nominal. It is clear that India can never be free, and its government cannot act freely and independently during the war. The Committee now reiterates that the necessary prerequisite for the people of India to bear responsibility in the current situation is to realize their freedom and be responsible for maintaining and defending their freedom. The most urgent need is the enthusiastic response of the people. If they do not have the great trust of the people, and they are not given the responsibility of defense, they will not be able to arouse their enthusiasm. The current government of India and its provincial governments lack the ability to bear the heavy burden of India's national defense. This heavy burden can only be borne by the people of India, but this will not be achieved unless they are given full responsibility. Therefore, the Committee cannot accept the proposals put forward by the representatives of the British War Cabinet."

### Sir Stafford Cripps to Leave India for England Tomorrow Morning; Report on the Process of Receiving Journalists Yesterday; Expressing Regret over India's Non-Cooperation

New Delhi, 11th (Reuters) – The main resolution of the Standing Committee of the Congress Party, which was announced today, stated that the party could not accept the British War Cabinet's proposals. Sir Stafford Cripps, the Lord Privy Seal, also disclosed the Congress Party's response when he received journalists today, stating that the party was not prepared to accept the British plan. According to Cripps' statement to reporters, "I have been forced to report to the British government that the proposal has not been accepted, and there is no need to issue a declaration according to the original plan. I will leave New Delhi on Monday morning and head for England. I may return to India later, but only God knows in what capacity. I have now received responses from all the major parties. Of the parties that negotiated with me, only the Congress Party delayed for a long time and met many times. As of 7:00 p.m. last night (local time), the Congress Party submitted a reply stating that its Standing Committee did not intend to accept the plan." Cripps then listed the departments within the authority of Indian members of the Executive Council as follows: Home Affairs, Transportation, Finance (including all war finance), Supply, and the Ministry of Defense, and the management of Indian personnel is also included. Apart from this, it is impossible to give Indian members further defense responsibilities without endangering General Wavell's current work to defend India. Protecting India is the highest responsibility of the British government, and for the benefit of the Allies assisting India, command must be unified. The real reason why the Chairman of the Congress Party refused to participate in the national government was that the method of the national government under discussion made it impossible for him to convene the Indian people as he wished. Therefore, the original plan has been withdrawn, and we have returned to the position before I came to India. Negotiations between the two sides are proceeding in a very frank and friendly spirit. If extremely complex changes are not made in the constitution, a national government cannot be formed. If this system is implemented under the current situation, the cabinet elected by the major party will not be responsible to anyone except itself, and it cannot be moved. In practice, it will become a kind of absolute dictatorship established by the majority ethnic group. The various minority ethnic groups in India will certainly oppose it, because they will be ruled by the permanent autocratic cabinet of the majority ethnic group, which is also contrary to the British government's promise to protect minority ethnic groups. Before the people of India have formulated their new constitution, the British government must continue to fulfill its mission to the large number of people in India who have been given guarantees. The British government has made concessions to the greatest possible extent, and is only unwilling to completely change the constitution. It is regrettable that the Standing Committee of the Congress Party has not obtained a basis for participating in the war effort under the conditions proposed by the British side. It should be known that the British side has proposed conditions that can unite all the people of India.

### Muslims Reject British Proposals

New Delhi, 11th (Reuters Telegram) – The All-India Muslim League's resolution on the British plan expressed gratitude for the British recognition of the possibility of partition and the establishment of two or more federations in India. However, it stated that it was regrettable that the British government's proposals did not allow any amendments. Therefore, it requested the British government to put forward alternative proposals. Regarding the British government's firm attitude that no amendments were allowed, the Committee had no choice but to declare that the proposals in the current form were not suitable for acceptance. The British government had recognized the right not to participate in the federation. This was roughly in response to the Muslims' demand for the partition of India. However, the methods and procedures stipulated made it impossible to achieve this goal. The original proposal gave existing provinces the right not to participate in the federation. These provinces were often established for administrative convenience and had no legal basis. The Muslims were not satisfied with this, but demanded a clear and unequivocal declaration. Any attempt to avoid the real key points in resolving India's future problems would only lead to disaster.

New Delhi, 11th (Havas) – It is heard that the Indian Muslim League has decided to resolutely reject the plan put forward by British envoy Sir Stafford Cripps. The reason is that the British did not take into account the Muslims' request to build a new country when revising the proposal.

### Fighting on the Bataan Peninsula Ceases; Corregidor Becomes an Isolated Island; US Troops Retreat to the Last Stronghold; External Communications Have Been Severed

Bataan Peninsula, 11th (Domei) – A US officer, advanced in years, accompanied by six soldiers in an open car flying a white flag, arrived near the Japanese lines near Limay on Thursday morning to negotiate surrender. They were then led by a Japanese front-line officer to meet the commander. The US officer identified himself as Major General King, the commander of the US forces on the Bataan Peninsula, and introduced his adjutant, Lieutenant Colonel William, and produced a formal request for surrender. However, the Japanese commander has not yet responded.

Washington, 10th (Havas) – President Roosevelt has received a telegram from General Wainwright, commander of the US forces in the Philippines, stating that our troops have done their best to defend the Bataan Peninsula. Recently, due to the strength of the Japanese artillery and air forces, which is far superior to our own, and the fact that our officers and soldiers are hungry, thirsty, and exhausted, we have had to give up resistance. There is reason to believe that all battles on the Bataan Peninsula have ceased. In the past 24 hours, traffic between Corregidor Island and the mainland has also been cut off. At the same time, the island has been repeatedly bombed by Japanese aircraft. Also, when the Japanese artillery on the Bataan Peninsula and the south shore of Manila Bay aimed at our artillery positions and bombarded them fiercely, our artillery positions did not retaliate because they did not know the situation on the mainland and were deeply afraid of hitting the remnants of our own troops.

Washington, 11th (Reuters) – According to a telegram from General Wainwright, commander of the US-Philippine forces in the Philippines, received by the War Department, traffic between Corregidor Island and the Bataan Peninsula has been cut off. However, it is heard that the fighting on Bataan Island has stopped. General Wainwright also reported to President Roosevelt, "I am grateful for your trust. Although the number of our troops is limited, we have supported them with all our strength. In the end, with exhausted troops, we could not defeat the Japanese superior air force and artillery fire. However, the American flag is still flying on the isolated fortress of Corregidor Island. Since the 9th of this month, the island has also been subjected to fierce bombing by Japanese aircraft and artillery." According to the US Navy Department, when the Japanese forces broke through the US defense line on the Bataan Peninsula, all US submarine supply ships and equipment, the Dewey dry dock, and minesweeper equipment in that area were completely destroyed to prevent them from falling into enemy hands. All 3,500 Navy and Marine Corps soldiers are thought to have retreated to Corregidor Island. This matter was handled by Captain Hofer, a US Navy officer in that area, on the orders of General Wainwright.

Washington, 10th (Havas) – Well-informed sources recently announced that the commanders of the 21st and 22nd US infantry regiments on the front line of the Bataan Peninsula have been captured by the Japanese army. The Japanese army continued to advance south and occupied Limay. The US-Philippine forces retreated step by step towards Mariveles. Several thousand soldiers defending the Limay area have been captured by the Japanese army. Several large fires have broken out at the Mariveles airfield, which is also the last foothold of the defenders of the peninsula. As for how long the defenders of the Corregidor fortress can hold out, it is still difficult to foresee. The fortress has been bombed more than 120 times. The US military retreated from the Luzon Island headquarters through the strait to Corregidor Island. The sacrifice must be great, of course, but it is still possible to achieve.

### US Troops Ordered to Scuttle Three Ships

Lisbon, 11th (Haitong News Agency) – The US Navy Department announced its 69th announcement last night, stating that one US submarine escort ship, one mine-laying ship, and one barge have been scuttled on the waters off the Bataan Peninsula, and a dry dock has been destroyed. This was carried out by Captain Hofer on the orders of Major General Wainwright. The escort ship had a displacement of 5,775 tons, a speed of 13 knots, and was equipped with two 12.8 cm guns, four 7.6 cm guns, and two 4.7 cm anti-aircraft guns. The minesweeper "Bittern" weighed 840 tons, had a speed of 14 knots, had several 7.6 cm guns, and a crew of 72. The barge "Napa" weighed 845 tons, had a speed of 13 knots, and was equipped with two 7.6 cm guns. Tokyo, 11th (Domei) – Military sources here claim that there has been virtually no US aircraft in the Philippine skies since December 29th of last year. This shows that the US Air Force has suffered a major blow since the outbreak of the Pacific War. It is reported that from the outbreak of the war on December 8th of last year to December 28th, Japanese aircraft shot down 158 enemy aircraft. Since the fall of Manila and the retreat of the US forces to the Bataan Peninsula, only a few US aircraft have taken off to intercept Japanese bombers. Furthermore, from January 2nd to February 9th of this year, the remaining US aircraft in the Philippines were shot down 29 more aircraft. Since then, the Japanese army has been able to attack various US military facilities without any concerns, and was able to safely carry out a general attack on the 3rd of this month.

### Traffic to Cebu Island Has Been Cut Off

Washington, 10th (Havas) – According to the Navy Department, radio traffic between the United States and Cebu Island in the Philippines has been cut off in the past 24 hours.

Manila, 11th (Domei) – Japanese naval forces began attacking Cebu Island, a key point in the southern Philippines, at dawn on the 10th. The elite troops of the Japanese naval landing force echoed the landing forces at Borili (west coast) and Aoga (65 kilometers south of Cebu City), broke into Cebu Bay at 10:00 a.m., and succeeded in landing. They then launched a sweeping battle in the city. Ships and oil ponds in the bay were set on fire by the enemy and are currently burning fiercely.

Washington, 10th (Havas) – After news of the Japanese occupation of the Bataan Peninsula reached here, military and political figures felt depressed and unhappy, believing that the Japanese forces led by General Yamashita could now be transferred elsewhere to fight, either increasing the threat to British troops in Burma and India, or becoming the vanguard of the invasion of Australia.

### Churchill Will Report to the House of Commons on Naval Losses; Recent Losses of British Ships in the Indian Ocean Have Affected India's Defense

London, 10th (Havas Telegram) – It is reported that Prime Minister Churchill will attend and report on the war situation at the next meeting of the House of Commons. According to well-informed sources, the Prime Minister will only report on the recent losses suffered by the British Navy, but will not allow the House of Commons to debate the war situation.

Liverpool, 10th (Havas) – The Duke of Devonshire, Under-Secretary of State for India, gave a speech at the Indian Seamen's Club today, saying, "We will encounter dark times, because the war is not only approaching India, but will become increasingly closer. Before the situation improves, we will inevitably encounter major difficulties."

Washington, 10th (Havas) – Military sources here recently said that an unprecedented naval battle is taking place in the Bay of Bengal in the Indian Ocean. The Japanese army will make full use of its air superiority in this battle. The intention of the Japanese army is probably to completely control the Bay of Bengal. In the past 48 hours, several British ships have sunk off the coast of the Indian Ocean. The seriousness of the situation can be seen from this. According to the recent military developments, it proves that it will not be difficult for the Japanese army to land in Ceylon and the Ganges River basin, and even occupy Calcutta. Military sources believe that the outcome of this war development will have a serious impact on the Allied countries. The Bay of Bengal has always been regarded as the gateway to the Indian Ocean. If it is controlled by the Japanese army, important communication lines of the Allied countries, such as the communication lines between the United Kingdom, the United States, and Australia, and the communication lines between the United States and the Soviet Union through the Persian Gulf, will be seriously threatened. In a word, the naval battle being fought in the Bay of Bengal today can have a serious impact on the war on all fronts, and is by no means comparable to ordinary battles.

### British Ships Sunk by Aircraft Only

Stockholm, Sweden, 11th (Haitong News Agency) – According to news from London, when the Japanese army attacked the British aircraft carrier "Hermes," the cruisers "Dorsetshire" and "Cornwall," they only used dive bombers and did not use torpedo planes. This battle record has shown that dive bombers are helpful in naval battles.

London, 10th (Havas) – Regarding the sinking of three British ships in the Indian Ocean by the Japanese Air Force, The Times of London recently wrote an article expressing regret, saying, "The Japanese aircraft took off from aircraft carriers. The sinking of our aircraft carrier 'Hermes' is another clear proof that warships cannot fight without sufficient protection. This loss is probably one of the major blows mentioned by Prime Minister Churchill in his recent speech in the House of Commons."

London, 11th (Havas) – According to Reuters, the British aircraft carrier "Hermes" (displacement 10,850 tons) was sunk by Japanese dive bombers 75 miles from Trincomalee Island near Ceylon. This aircraft carrier was built in 1924 and remodeled in 1934. It can carry 15 aircraft, 664 sailors, and is equipped with six 5.5-inch guns. In July 1940, the British fleet attacked Dakar, French West Africa, and the "Hermes" also participated in the operation. The aircraft on board flew over the port and bombed the French battleship "Richelieu."

### Speech by Japanese Naval Spokesman

Tokyo, 11th (Haitong News Agency) – Japanese naval spokesman Colonel Hiraide gave a radio speech yesterday, saying, "The scope of activities of the Japanese Navy extends west to the American coast, east to the Indian Ocean, north to the Aleutian Islands, and south to Australia. The great victory in the Indian Ocean is only the beginning of the operations of our fleet. India is the treasure house of the British Empire. The loss of India is tantamount to the collapse of the Empire. Today, the Bay of Bengal is under our control, and the entire Indian Ocean will soon suffer the same fate. The British side previously claimed that Colombo had a strong fleet stationed there, but the Japanese Navy has not encountered it during its operations in the Indian Ocean. It can be seen that the British ships are avoiding fighting the Japanese ships. After sinking 400,000 tons of enemy ships, the Japanese army has cut off the communication lines in the Indian Ocean. Enemy ships have no other way out than to escape to the western Indian Ocean. The British and American fleets have not yet fought a decisive battle with the Japanese fleet. It is deeply regrettable that the Japanese fleet has not lost any strength and is willing to compete with the enemy."

### Australian Government Demands Full Authority; Bill Has Been Submitted to Parliament

Melbourne, 11th (Havas) – The Australian government has submitted a bill to parliament demanding full authority. Prime Minister Curtin recently spoke on the bill, strongly arguing that if parliament refuses, the government will not be able to concentrate the country's resources to cope with the war, and will not be able to perform its duties.

Saigon, 11th (Haitong News Agency) – According to news from Canberra, Australia's war expenditure has increased sharply. The daily war expenditure in March was 30% higher than in February. 60% of the war expenditure in March was compensated by public debt.

Saigon, 11th (Haitong News Agency) – According to news received here last night, a quarter of New Zealand men have been called up for military service. 6,000 railway employees and 5,000 postal and telecommunications workers have been called up for military service.

Lisbon, 11th (Haitong News Agency) – According to a Washington dispatch, an air raid alert was issued here on Thursday night, the second air raid alert issued in the US capital since the US entered the war. It was lifted after 36 minutes.

### Japanese Army Establishes Headquarters in North Borneo; Maeda is the Supreme Commander

Today, it ordered the collection of waste paper from various places starting from the 20th of this month in order to make use of waste materials and save material resources.

### Report of Allied Powers' Decision to Launch Offensive Early; U.S. Chief of Staff Marshall and Others Attend Special British Cabinet Meeting

New York, 10th (Havas) - According to a London dispatch, U.S. Army Chief of Staff General Marshall attended a "Special Meeting" of the British War Cabinet this morning. Key British cabinet members and Hopkins were also present. According to informed sources, the purpose of this meeting between British and American representatives was to discuss measures to be taken by the Allied Powers in launching a counter-offensive against the Axis Powers. It is also understood that the United States does not wish to wait until the Allied Powers have a firm material advantage before launching an offensive. Therefore, it is reported that the Allied Powers have decided to act early. In addition, General Marshall will meet with representatives of exiled governments currently in London to discuss all matters.

London, 11th (Havas) - Home Secretary and Minister of Public Security Morrison delivered a speech yesterday, urging the British people to be vigilant and not to be negligent in preventing any invasion of the British Isles.

British Forces in North Africa Launch Two Attacks

Cairo, 10th (Havas) - According to informed sources, the British Eighth Army in North Africa has begun an offensive to prevent German forces from attacking the southern Libyan desert area. Two tank attacks were launched today. At the same time, Axis tank units were bombarded by British artillery, with several tanks hit and set on fire.

Stockholm, Sweden, 11th (Haitong) - A report from London last night stated that rumors circulating abroad of a large-scale Axis offensive in North Africa have not been confirmed.

Bern, Switzerland, 10th (Havas) - A correspondent for the Neue Zürcher Zeitung in London reported that British military officials are closely monitoring the situation in North Africa. The purpose of the Axis forces' current pressure in North Africa is to attempt to break through the outposts of the British Eighth Army to probe its true strength and the location of minefields, or whether it is indeed a prelude to a large-scale offensive. The British are still unsure. The Axis elite forces in North Africa consist of two German armored divisions, one motorized infantry division, one Italian armored division, and five infantry divisions.

### Eastern Front Situation: No Major Changes; No Sign of When Germany Will Launch Large-Scale Offensive

German Headquarters, 11th (Haitong)

The German military report this afternoon stated that after the large-scale Soviet offensive on the Kerch Peninsula yesterday was crushed, there were no major battles in that area. The number of Soviet tanks destroyed has reached seventy-two, with twenty-nine rendered inoperable. In the Black Sea area, German fighter groups bombed Soviet port facilities, damaging two large merchant ships. Several enemy units trapped in the central sector have been annihilated. German troops are advancing smoothly, inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy. In the northern sector, Soviet attacks under the cover of tanks were unsuccessful. German mountain troops and Finnish forces occupied a strong enemy base in the Lapland area, destroying forty bunkers. A Soviet submarine sailed near the northern coast of Norway and was destroyed by German mines.

Moscow, 11th (Reuters) - The Soviet Union's supplementary communique at noon today stated that several villages in the Bryansk area have been recaptured by Soviet forces. There were no major changes on the front line on the night of April 10. Several strong German strongholds in the Leningrad area have also been destroyed.

### British Planes Attack Germany

Berlin, 11th (Haitong) - A spokesman for the German Foreign Ministry commented on the statement by Soviet government spokesman Lozovsky that the Soviet Union would achieve a decisive victory this year, using Litvinov's speech last night as a counter-argument. In his speech last night, Litvinov called on the Allied Powers to provide rapid assistance, otherwise the opportunity may be lost. Comparing the opinions of the two, their understanding of the situation differs greatly, which shows the exaggeration of Lozovsky.

Bern, Switzerland, 10th (Havas) - The Basler Nachrichten recently reported that Berlin officials are focusing on the upcoming spring offensive. The general German public also expects the German army to launch a large-scale offensive on the Eastern Front. However, there is currently no sign of when this offensive will be launched or where it will take place. According to officials, although the main effort of the German army will be concentrated on the Eastern Front, the German High Command is still taking precautions to prevent the Allied Powers from opening a second front. In addition, the purpose of the German spring offensive is not to occupy Soviet territory, but to eliminate the Red Army's resistance. This is something that must be understood.

Berlin, 11th (Haitong) - Authoritative sources say that British planes dropped bombs on residential areas in western and northwestern Germany last night, damaging several houses and causing some casualties. It is reported that nine British planes were shot down.

### Bulgarian Cabinet Resigns

Philadelphia, 11th (Havas) - Soviet Ambassador to the United States Litvinov delivered a speech at the Academy of Political and Social Science here today, again demanding "direct action" against Germany by the Allied Powers. He stated that blockades and bombings are not enough to win. Victory depends on the battlefield. If we want to win, we must act together. We should not be satisfied with trying to find a way to win, but must work together to find it, and must act quickly, lest this path be blocked before it is discovered.

### Sweden Divides into Seven Military Districts; Infantry Steps Up Mechanization

Stockholm, Sweden, German News Agency

It is reported that a proposal on organizing the Swedish national defense force has been submitted to the Swedish government. The proposal stipulates that the budget for the national defense force will be 380 million Swedish kronor between 1942 and 1947. One of the outstanding points of the defense plan is the appointment of a commander-in-chief of the Swedish national defense force, which is unprecedented in Sweden. The Swedish territory will be divided into seven military districts, and the army will step up mechanization. The infantry will be equipped with bicycles, and the tank force will consist of four regiments. The anti-aircraft artillery force will be an independent unit, and the air force will be divided into sixteen squadrons. The country will be divided into five air force bases, with the regional air force commanders directly responsible.

Washington, 10th (Havas) - President Roosevelt today replied to questions from the press, saying that the government will take various measures within a week to ensure that the arms industry can make full use of skilled workers. In other words, the government will continue to work to allocate skilled workers to industries lacking specialized personnel. There are generally two ways to achieve this goal: one is to establish a new agency to handle labor allocation with specific responsibilities, and the other is to supervise existing labor exchanges. In short, the government is very concerned about this matter, and one of the methods currently being considered is to encourage female workers between the ages of sixteen and sixty-five to register voluntarily.

### Soviet Intelligence Chief Makes Statement

Kuybyshev, 11th (Havas)

Soviet intelligence chief Lozovsky, who has not been in contact with the press for several months, suddenly received reporters again today and made a statement. According to him, this move will be beneficial to both countries at the end of this year. As for the lawsuit being conducted in the Turkish capital (referring to the case of the assassination of German envoy von Papen), it is purely the result of foreign provocation and will eventually be brought to light. Regarding the agreement signed by Britain, the Soviet Union, and Iran, it has greatly improved the situation in Iran because it is fully in line with the interests of the three countries. The rumor that we want to Sovietize Iran is not true.

### Japanese Plan to Allow Chinese-Run Industries in Hong Kong to Resume Operations

Hong Kong, 10th (Domei) - Governor Isogai of the occupied territory of Hong Kong stated today when meeting with a group of reporters at the Governor's new office that the important issues in Hong Kong are self-sufficiency of materials and dispersing the population. These two issues are currently being implemented step by step according to the plan. The prerequisite for solving the problem is the shipping issue. Under the current situation, ships cannot rely on Japan, but it is believed that Hong Kong can be self-sufficient without relying on Japan. In the past, British and American materials used Hong Kong as a contact point before being transported to various parts of China, but in the future Hong Kong must have the mission of transporting Japanese materials to China and Southeast Asia, or transporting Chinese and Southeast Asian materials to Japan. Industries run by Chinese will be allowed to resume operations freely and develop freely in the future.

Tokyo, 11th (Haitong) - The Japanese Governor of Hong Kong took the opportunity of moving the Japanese Governor's Office to the former HSBC Building today to issue a statement saying that Hong Kong will occupy a special position among the world's major ports. When the British and American forces in Hong Kong are completely eradicated, Japanese culture will not force the Chinese and people of other countries to accept it, but to understand Japan's purpose. The names of the streets in Hong Kong are currently in Chinese, English, and Japanese. In the future, it is planned to use only Japanese.

### Silver and Money Industry Joint Reserve Pool Exerts Effort to Regulate Financial Affairs of Industry Colleagues, Handles Interbank and Interdealer Loan Matters, Supplies Cash as Much as Possible to Stabilize the Market

In view of the lack of cash on the market and the tightening of money, the Joint Reserve Pool of the Silver and Money Industries is making every effort to regulate finances and stabilize the market by adjusting the funds needed by member banks and dealers, which is handled by the Loan Committee, using the collateral originally paid by each bank and dealer as security. However, the receipt and payment of checks drawn on the Reserve Committee issued by various correspondent banks will still be limited to transfers for the time being. At the same time, cash is supplied to various banks and dealers as much as possible. Banks and dealers that need more than 100,000 yuan in cash should notify in advance.

Easy Money Market Can Be Restored

Regarding the funds deposited in the Central Bank, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications by various Chinese commercial banks and remittance dealers before December 8 of last year, although the Provisional Joint Committee of Members of the Silver and Money Industries has repeatedly negotiated a proper solution, the issues of the three banks (Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications) have not yet been completely resolved, so the funds deposited in the three banks by various banks and dealers have not been able to be used. It is reported that a proper solution will be promulgated soon, so the funds of various banks and dealers will not be lacking and will be able to cope with the current market. Although the money market is temporarily tight, it can be eased.

Investigate Amount of Legal Tender of Banks and Dealers

On the 8th, various banks and dealers received a notice from the Provisional Joint Committee of Members of the Silver and Money Industries, ordering them to fill out and report the general situation of legal tender receipts and expenditures from now on.

The amounts are divided into four categories: original deposit, income, expenditure, and balance.

### Cigarette Shops Sell Cigarettes at Limited Prices, To Increase by One Hundred

According to the English-language Shanghai Evening Post, news came yesterday morning that another one hundred cigarette shops will soon be entrusted to sell a limited number of cigarettes at the limited prices stipulated by the Japanese authorities in military currency. These cigarette shops will sell cigarettes publicly, but each person will be limited to buying two packs of 10-cigarette packs, one pack of 20-cigarette packs, or one can of 50-cigarette packs at a time to prevent hoarding. These one hundred cigarette shops are mostly located in the French Concession and the International Settlement. One hundred cigarette shops have previously sold cigarettes at the official military currency price, mostly located in the central district of the International Settlement. Some cigarette shops have been suspected of "backdoor transactions," and the authorities are currently planning to take measures to eliminate this situation. "Backdoor transactions" refer to selling limited-price cigarettes to colleagues who do not sell cigarettes at limited prices in order to profit.

### Kinmen Maru Sailed to Xiamen Yesterday, Carrying Fellow Villagers Back to Their Hometown

The Kinmen Maru set sail from Shanghai to Xiamen at noon yesterday. The ship requested 200 half-price cabins from the Chinese Repatriation Association, and entrusted the Fujian Native Association in Shanghai to register fellow villagers from Fujian who did not need to stay in Shanghai. Although more than 280 people registered at that time, more than 100 of them still need to transfer to various parts of Fujian Province after arriving in Xiamen. Because of the current transportation difficulties, only those who have detailed addresses in Xiamen are allowed to travel. Therefore, after selection, only more than 130 people were obtained, who boarded the ship yesterday morning, and the ship set sail directly to Xiamen at noon.

### Terrorist Drill Yesterday in the Area of the Puthong Road Police Station

At 3:30 p.m. yesterday, the Shanghai Municipal Police once again held a terrorist drill in the area under the jurisdiction of the Puthong Road Police Station.

### Allied Nationals to Withdraw Gradually; Diplomatic and Consular Officials Have Priority for Repatriation, Concentrated in Shanghai and then Transported to Portuguese East Africa

According to the English-language Shanghai Evening Post, Dr. Pilsong, the official in charge of American affairs at the Swiss Consulate in Shanghai, made a formal statement to reporters today (the 11th), saying that the Japanese authorities have agreed on the repatriation of 320 British and American nationals in Shanghai on the first ship leaving Shanghai next month. Strict priority will be given to British and American diplomatic and consular officials. As for the remaining civilians who can be repatriated on this ship, the number will depend on the size and capacity of the ship. However, it has been decided that the second category of British and American nationals to be repatriated will be personnel from the Red Cross and other organizations, followed by journalists. Among them, overseas correspondents will have priority. It is expected that the first ship will not be enough to accommodate the above-mentioned categories of nationals. However, it is hoped that several other ships will leave Shanghai one after another after a considerable period of time. As for the British and American nationals who will still remain in Shanghai, negotiations are still underway and no decision has been made on how to deal with them. Which categories of nationals remaining in Shanghai will have priority for repatriation is currently under discussion and has not been agreed upon.

Diplomatic Personnel Repatriated First

In addition, Kawasaki, a spokesman for the Japanese Embassy, said at a press conference yesterday (the 10th) that the 1,000 enemy nationals to be repatriated from China in late May will be the first batch. The Japanese authorities concerned are giving great consideration to the implementation of this measure. The governments of the countries concerned have consulted with the Japanese side on the repatriation of their nationals and have made concrete arrangements. Therefore, most of the repatriated nationals will gather in Shanghai. As previously disclosed, the repatriated enemy nationals include diplomatic personnel and ordinary nationals. However, this plan will be limited by the capacity of two Japanese postal ships, which will carry enemy nationals to Lourenço Marques in Portuguese East Africa to exchange for Japanese nationals. Because the capacity of the Japanese ships is limited, diplomatic and consular personnel may not be completely included in the first batch of repatriated nationals. However, it is inevitable that priority will be given to such enemy nationals in large cities such as Shanghai, Tianjin, and Beijing.

Concentrated in Shanghai and Transported to East Africa

According to the original arrangement, the repatriation ship was scheduled to leave Shanghai in early April, but it was not possible to do so in time and had to be postponed for a month. Two Japanese ships will sail from Japan to Shanghai to carry enemy nationals from North China, Manchuria, and Korea. Then, the ship will set sail and only dock in Saigon on the way to Lourenço Marques to carry enemy nationals gathered there from various parts of South China. The Japanese authorities here are currently encountering a difficulty, which is the housing problem for enemy nationals in the interior who are preparing to come to Shanghai. In this regard, it is hoped that the public will provide temporary housing for these enemy nationals. At the same time, the authorities concerned are discussing with the Hwa Wei, Metropolis, International, Astor, and Broadway hotels and the YMCA to find suitable rooms for temporary housing.

Japanese Consulate General Handles Everything

The office of the Japanese Consulate General in charge of repatriation matters is now presenting the scene of a travel agency, as it is also handling hotel accommodation and other matters for enemy nationals. Another problem encountered by the Japanese authorities is luggage. However, the authorities have given lenient consideration to personal belongings. In fact, there is no specified limit on luggage. No matter how much luggage there is, it can be carried as long as it is reasonable. The approximate number of repatriated enemy nationals is 360 in North China, 500 in Central China, and 150 in South China. In Central China, there are about 320 in Shanghai, 115 in Hankou, and 84 in Nanjing. In North China, there are about 150 in Tianjin and Beijing, 157 in Qingdao, and about 15 in Weihaiwei. In South China, there are 51 in Guangzhou, 34 in Shantou, and 70 in Xiamen.

### Sullivan Branch Fined for Violations

Purchasing Milk From Unlicensed Dairy Farms

The Shanghai Municipal Council recently issued a notice stating that Xu Tianxing, the licensee of the Sullivan Bakery branch at No. 11 Tongfu Road, was fined 50 Central Reserve Bank yuan by the First Special District Court on the morning of the 10th of this month for violating Rule 26 of the Tea Room License issued pursuant to Section 34 of the Appendix to the Land Regulations by purchasing milk from unlicensed dairy farms.

### Citizens Line Up to Buy Foreign Rice, Implemented Numbering and Seating on the Ground to Avoid All Kinds of Malpractices Such as Squeezing, Most Rice Shops Have Not Followed This Method Yet Yesterday

In order to facilitate citizens' purchase of foreign rice and to avoid the recurrence of various unfortunate events, the Shanghai Municipal Council Rice and Grain Office has now set another method for citizens to purchase rice. All citizens must line up in order and sit down on the ground, otherwise they will not be numbered and refused to sell to. The method was first tried yesterday and the situation was good. However, most rice shops have not yet followed this method, so the congestion has not yet been eliminated. It is reported that a woman was seriously injured due to excessive squeezing at a certain rice shop on Rue Ever since, and although she was sent to the hospital by her family for treatment, she eventually died of her injuries the next day. However, the authorities are paying close attention to the continued occurrence of such unfortunate events and are trying to improve the situation.

Number of Rice Shops Selling Rice Has Increased Yesterday

Since last week, the Shanghai Municipal Council Rice and Grain Office has once reduced the quantity of foreign rice allocated, so that some rice shops cannot receive foreign rice as usual and sell it at the door at the original price. However, it has been found that there is no other reason for this measure by the Shanghai Municipal Council. Because the various procedures have been completely negotiated, the number of rice shops selling foreign rice has increased from yesterday. However, the quantity of sales has not yet increased. However, according to the person in charge of the Shanghai Municipal Council, the bureau will gradually increase the quantity of foreign rice sold by each rice shop as long as it is practically possible, so that citizens can purchase rice at nearby rice shops and reduce various congestion situations.

Warehouse Rice Has Not Been Released on Road Yesterday

It is also learned that the foreign rice extracted by the rice shops designated by the Shanghai Municipal Council Rice and Grain Office from the Siemens, Fuxin, Taikoo, and godowns has not been completely released yesterday. The godown will stop extracting rice on Sunday and can continue to extract it tomorrow. Therefore, the situation of rice shops selling foreign rice tomorrow (Monday) will not be as universal as on Wednesday. As for the sales methods, quantity restrictions, and prices, there are no changes. It is also learned that the quantity of foreign rice allocated by the Rice and Grain Management Committee to each rice shop has recently increased, and the increase is about one-quarter, which shows that the supply of bureau rice will not be in short supply. The residents of this port have no need to worry.

### Method of Calculating Area for Subletting Rooms

The Shanghai Municipal Council's Room Subletting Management Office has announced the following method for calculating the rent payable by subtenants, in accordance with the regulations on permits: The total area of the entire house refers to the sum of the areas of each room, measured in square feet, excluding common areas such as the kitchen, corridors, stairwells, and courtyards. The rent per square foot can be calculated by adding the rent paid to the main landlord, plus the monthly water and electricity fees, municipal taxes, and license fees (3 yuan per month), plus a legitimate profit of 20%, and dividing the total by the total number of square feet in the house. The rent payable by a particular tenant is then calculated by multiplying the square footage they occupy by this rate.

### Number of Japanese Residents in Shanghai Exceeds 90,000

### Postal Money Orders: No Recent Changes

The exchange of money orders between Shanghai and all of Jiangsu Province, as well as the occupied areas of Zhejiang and Guangzhou, remains suspended. Money orders from the occupied areas to Shanghai are still limited to a maximum of 100 yuan for cashing. Money orders from other places to Shanghai can only be cashed up to a maximum of 50 yuan. The public is very concerned about these small-value money orders, so this is being noted.

### Old Accountant Embezzles Large Sum, Loses It All Gambling, and Flees

On the afternoon of May 8th of last year, the Baodali Foreign Firm at No. 330 Sichuan Road instructed Shen Gangyu, a Ningbo native working as an accountant for the firm, to deposit a check for 12,000 yuan from Datong Bank into the firm's account. However, Shen had malicious intentions and immediately cashed the check at the bank and went to a gambling den to gamble. Unexpectedly, he lost repeatedly and ran out of money, and then fled without a trace. Afterward, the manager of the foreign firm reported the incident to the police and requested an arrest warrant, and also instructed Li Xinrong, Shen's guarantor, to find him. Until recently, Li ran into Shen at the intersection of Sichuan Road and Jiujiang Road. He immediately turned him over to the police on duty, who escorted him to the police station for questioning.

### Visiting the "You You Orphanage"

— Gong Yunyan

On a mid-spring morning, the sky was cluttered with clouds of varying thickness, and the sun intermittently cast captivating rays from behind the clouds, allowing one to savor the warmth and gentleness of spring. A group of over eighty of us stepped into the "You You Orphanage" on Kaifeng Road.

The first thing that caught our eye was a grand auditorium. Dozens of children in short blue jackets were eating there (twice a day: 10 AM and 4 PM), each with a bowl of golden rice (corn) and a plate of jade-green vegetables (greens), swiftly conveying the food to their mouths. Several small leaders stood by, managing and caring for them, maintaining perfect order. After watching for a while, we were accompanied by Director Chen of the orphanage to tour the building.

We ascended from the west and first saw the various classrooms (the orphanage has six grades, all single-grade classes). Although the desks and chairs were old, everything was kept spotlessly clean. The decorations made extensive use of waste materials, demonstrating unique ingenuity. When we arrived at the first-grade classroom, a cry of "Attention!" rang out, and thirty or forty small right hands smartly raised to their foreheads in unison, a lively and serious gesture that filled us with admiration.

Next were the storage room, the student union office, the reading room, the dormitories, the infirmary... all of which were also very clean. The infirmary, in particular, was swept so clean that the windows were bright and spotless, and the caring manner in which the young nurses comforted the patients fully expressed the great and sincere "love" between human beings.

Descending the stairs and walking north, we came to the bathroom, a rectangular pool made of cement, large enough for about ten people. It had cold and hot water taps and overhead showerheads, so it was quite well equipped. Emerging from the bathroom, we reached the kitchen, where, amidst the rising steam, we saw three or five children serving rice. They carefully scooped the rice from the pot, one shovelful at a time, into rice baskets, without a single grain falling on the ground. Next to the rice room was the furnace room, connected by a gas pipe. It provided the heat to cook the two meals a day.

Further on was the laundry room, where eight or nine children, sleeves rolled up and barefoot, were working. They divided the work: applying soap, scrubbing, rinsing, each performing their duties without confusion. Although everyone's face looked malnourished, they were exceptionally excited, without a trace of fatigue.

Emerging from the laundry room, we saw the workshop, where several workers were guiding the children in weaving small chairs. Their hands moved swiftly and precisely, and in no time, a small chair was finished. It is said that such a small chair can sell for at least six or seven yuan, demonstrating that having a skill ensures one will not lack food or clothing.

Passing through the auditorium from the workshop, we arrived at the grinding room. That day, due to a lack of raw materials – corn – work was temporarily suspended. But to satisfy our curiosity, Director Chen invited a few children to demonstrate. The roar of the motor filled the air, and the entire machine began to operate. The children first put the corn into the grinder, and then the crushed corn was sent from the grinder to the mill. They held the flour bags over the nozzles, and a steady stream of fine flour poured out. We took turns watching for a while, then gathered in a perfect circle in the courtyard. At this time, the children on the balcony sang "Orphan's Song," and when they sang: "Orphans are the future masters of the country, they have brains to think, and hands to work," we responded with warm applause, a resounding harmony that seemed to resonate on our heartstrings with an infinitely joyful symphony.

Finally, Director Ruan of the General Affairs Department gave a report, divided into three sections: history, process, and current situation. When describing the current situation, he said: "Due to economic difficulties, we are in the process of relocation, preparing to relocate one-third of the more than three hundred orphans. But in fact, after these one-third of the orphans are dispersed, they will not only lose the opportunity to study, but also lose the opportunity to survive. Because most of them are fatherless orphans, and their mothers are working as domestic servants to make ends meet, barely able to support themselves. Once they leave the orphanage, they will naturally be reduced to starving corpses. These days, when we notified them of the relocation and they came to the orphanage to take them away, not one of them failed to recount the hardships of life, tearfully begging us to continue to take them in. We certainly do not want to sit idly by and watch them die; but in this situation where there is no room for further cost-cutting, even after the relocation, funding is still a problem, so how can we have the resources to support them? ... In addition, the food and coal we have stored will at most last for three months. If we do not receive generous donations, I am afraid that the entire orphanage will disintegrate after these three months. For the survival of all the orphans in the orphanage, we must loudly appeal to all sectors of society – save the orphans! ..."

After hearing Director Ruan's report, we all felt depressed. As we left the orphanage gate, the cry of "Save the orphans!" echoed in our ears. A wave of sadness washed over us, and we seemed to see hundreds of emaciated children, their small, withered hands outstretched, pleading for their lives!

### Strictly Punish Those Who Buy Foreign Rice to Resell for Profit
### "Rice Buying Gang" Disrupts Order, Makes It Difficult for Poor Residents to Purchase Rice

The authorities of the two concessions in this city, in order to maintain the food supply for residents within the concessions, first prohibited the transportation of food out of the concessions, and then ordered all rice shops to sell rice to the people, limiting each person to one "sheng" (a unit of measure) per instance, preventing them from buying more. As a result, men, women, old, and young, lined up in front of the rice shops in order, causing great crowding. Patrolmen stationed in the Chinese-controlled area were ordered to strictly inspect pedestrians to prevent the smuggling of rice out of the area, in order to ensure the food supply for residents. However, there are still cunning men and women who seize the opportunity every day to go to the concessions to crowd in and buy rice for resale, making a living from this. These people can make a profit of 1.5 to 2 yuan from selling one "sheng" of rice that they bought at the controlled price. As a result, the strong push and crowd to the front, and can buy three or four "sheng" or even one "dou" (another unit of measure) in a day, making a considerable profit, while the timid and poor people crowd and push all day long, but end up lagging behind, and from morning to night, cannot buy a single grain of rice to take home. They suffer the pain of being pushed and crowded, and also suffer the pangs of hunger. There have even been cases of weak people being injured and dying in the crowding, which is not uncommon. The tragic situation is heartbreaking. It is heard that the French authorities have received reports and are paying attention to this issue. Yesterday, it was reported that each police station dispatched detectives to the rice shops on rice buying days to conduct strict inspections. If they encounter anyone buying and selling rice back and forth with suspicious behavior, they will be arrested and investigated. It is heard that dozens of people have already been arrested. From now on, the timid and weak people can hopefully safely buy rice, which is also a good policy of the authorities to care for the people's food supply.

### Morphine Den Raided

The French Concession authorities, in order to maintain the safety of residents, recently dispatched a large number of Chinese and foreign detectives to search houses in the concession. Details have already been reported in the newspapers. It is now learned that the detectives searched No. 43, Lane 87, Lafayette Road on the other day and cracked down on a morphine trafficking operation, arresting two Hunanese men, Zhang Haichao (52 years old) and Tan Jinlan (45 years old), and seizing 187 packets of morphine. Also, on the overhead floor of Lane 2, Lagna Road (i.e., Huanghe Road), they arrested an old Ningbo woman, Zhou Chenshi (56 years old), and seized 170 packets of morphine. They were all taken to the police station. Zhang and others confessed that they were instructed to sell by a Korean boss, and that they were all employees and only received daily wages. The police chief ordered them to be detained pending investigation.

### Fire at Barber Shop

### Partner of Western-Style Clothing Store Abandons Partner

Wang Lanfang, a 37-year-old partner in the Da Shanghai Western-Style Clothing Store at No. 155 Xiafei Road, met a Soviet woman, Jin Ziyun (38 years old), in Hankou, Hubei ten years ago. They fell in love at first sight and began living together, and had a son and a daughter. In the 20th year of the Republic, Wang came to Shanghai to seek a living, abandoning Jin and her three children in Hankou, and never contacted them again. Unexpectedly, after Wang came to Shanghai, he managed to run his business well and invested in opening the Da Shanghai Western-Style Clothing Store. When Jin saw that Wang had been gone for a long time without any news, she brought her children to Shanghai to find her husband. She discovered that he had found someone else, so she reported it to the police station, accusing Wang of abandonment and requesting his arrest and legal punishment.

### Vegetable Vendors in French Concession Petition for Extension of Business Hours

The Public Works Bureau of the French Concession has always stipulated that the closing time for all vegetable markets should be 11:00 AM. From April 1st to October 30th, during the summer hours, the closing time was changed to 10:00 AM. The vegetable vendors felt that it was convenient to close at that time. Since the city implemented daylight saving time earlier, the operating hours of the vegetable markets were also closed according to the new clock time. It is now learned that the French Public Works Bureau announced the other day that from April onwards, all markets would close at 10:00 AM. The vendors believe that the 10:00 AM closing time was originally the summer closing time, but now that the city's daylight saving time has been implemented earlier, the operating hours should be reduced by one hour in practice. Furthermore, the general public has not broken the habit of waking up late, so those who buy vegetables a little later are often disappointed. The impact on business is significant. Therefore, yesterday, they sent representatives to petition the French Concession Taxpayers' Association and various organizations for relief, requesting them to forward a letter to the French authorities to extend the closing time by one hour in order to maintain their livelihoods.

### Maid Steals Silver Box, Opens It in Hotel and Gets Arrested

She was instigated by someone to steal a silver iron box from the closet while her mistress, Feng Chenshi, was sleeping soundly at 7:00 AM the other morning. She fled to the Zhonghua Hotel on Mofang Street, booked a room, and borrowed a hammer from the tea boy to open the silver iron box. Inside was 900 yuan in cash, 800 yuan in promissory notes, a gold lock, and two gold wooden fish. When she was knocking on the box, the hotel accountant saw her suspicious behavior and immediately reported it to the French police. The police dispatched detectives to arrest the woman and take the stolen goods to the police station. The stolen goods were first returned to the original owner, and the theft will be handled after investigation.

Talking About the Mind

### Second Buddhist Studies Lecture at San Zang Jing She Temple, Given by Dharma Master Ying Ci, Recorded by Wang Muyang

The mind, whether in Confucianism, Buddhism, or other religions, has been interpreted. Although the explanations differ, they ultimately lead to the same destination by different paths. Everything is based on the mind. Everyone has a mind. Having a body means having a mind. Having a mind means having a body. Body and mind are interconnected, and together they form a person. Buddhism says, "Enlighten the mind and see the nature." Confucianism says, "Correct the mind and make the intention sincere." They are actually mutually compatible and not contradictory. If a person can keep the mind upright, then what is expressed will naturally be bright, and the realm touched will naturally be open. If the mind can be stopped and the intention can be made sincere, that is to enlighten the mind and see the nature. The Second Patriarch visited the First Patriarch and said, "My mind is not at peace. I beg you, Master, to give me peace." The First Patriarch said, "Bring your mind to me and I will give you peace." This is the essence of the Buddhist transmission of the mind. In Confucianism, it is believed that the human mind is not upright because it is obscured by material desires, losing its original nature. As it is said, "Having likes and dislikes means not being able to be upright. Having worries and anxieties means not being able to be upright. Having anger and resentment means not being able to be upright." Being able to eliminate all material emotions means that the mind will naturally be upright. The Buddhist enlightenment of the mind means being without obstacles, without sorrow or joy, and even without good or evil, before one can enlighten the mind. The human mind is originally bright, but it cannot be bright because of the differences between good and evil. Mencius said that everyone has a feeling of compassion, everyone has a feeling of shame and dislike, and everyone has a sense of right and wrong. In this way, because of having these feelings, differences arise, making it difficult to enlighten the mind. The Buddhist enlightenment of the mind means being without mind. If there is a mind, then appearances arise. If there are appearances, then differences arise. Therefore, offering to thousands of Buddhas is not as good as offering to a Daoist without mind. If people want to correct and enlighten their minds, they should first eliminate desires. Eliminating desires means eliminating material emotions. The world's animals and plants become the source of calamity because of having emotions. When Bodhidharma first came to the Eastern Land, he specialized in receiving those with sharp roots and superior intelligence, causing them to shed the habits of names and words and recognize their original minds. This is the essence of enlightening and correcting the mind. The human mind is originally tranquil, but appearances arise because of the environment. As the saying goes, "The mind is originally without birth, but arises because of the environment." The bell is used as an analogy. The bell is the object of color, the eye is the sense organ, and between the sense organ and the object, consciousness is the connection, just like the ear to sound, the tongue to taste, and the nose to smell. The six senses of people all belong to emptiness. Ordinary people also divide the mind into an enlightened mind and a deluded mind. Being immersed in material desires is the deluded mind. Yan Hui living in a humble lane eating a simple meal without changing his joy is the enlightened mind. Both the enlightened mind and the deluded mind are not the correct mind. The correct mind is without delusion or enlightenment. Being deluded or enlightened is biased and not correct. People see saints as saints and deluded people as ordinary people, but in reality, the correct mind has no ordinary or saintly. Mencius said that he was unmoved by external things at forty, but Buddhism goes even further, saying that there is no movement at all, because no appearances arise, so there is no cause for movement. The infinite kalpas of the world arise from movement. Movement of the mind causes chaos. Therefore, saving the mind lies in stillness. How can the world be stabilized? Stabilize it in one. The mind being stilled, one can gradually achieve peace. Prescribing the right medicine for the illness, saving the world should start with saving the mind. If one person's mind is corrected, one person is saved. If ten people's minds are corrected, ten people are saved, and so on for millions of people. If the mind is stilled, then it is correct. If the mind is correct, then it is bright. If everyone's mind is bright, then the world will be one family, and there will be no calamities. The inner sage and outer king of Confucianism, can it be achieved with empty words? It is necessary to thoroughly educate people, so that everyone can recover their innate knowledge and abilities. The Great Learning lies in the investigation of things. Being able to investigate material emotions means that there will be no contention. Confucianism and Buddhism are truly different paths leading to the same destination. Ordinary people also divide the mind into a good mind and an evil mind. In reality, having differences of good and evil is not the correct mind. Therefore, the Sixth Patriarch said, "Not thinking of good, not thinking of evil, what is your original face?" The sutra says, "One should contemplate the nature of the Dharma realm, everything is created by the mind." Both good and evil are created by the mind. Furthermore, appearances of living beings, appearances of those who live long, are all differences arising from the mind, making it difficult to correct the mind and make the intention sincere, and to enlighten the mind and see the nature, leading people to suffer the pain of birth, old age, sickness, and death, and the world to suffer the calamities of war, water, and fire. Saving the world without first enlightening the mind is insufficient in treating the root cause, and is merely a superficial rescue, and ultimately futile. Today, talking about the mind to all of you, great virtues, is precisely to correct and enlighten the mind. The Three Baskets and Twelve Divisions of the scriptures all aim to explain the mind. The roots of the Five Classics and Four Books all aim to speak of correcting the mind. If the mind can be corrected and can be bright, then there is no suffering or joy. Suffering and joy arise from appearances, which then give rise to differences, ultimately leading to inequality. It must be known that wherever there is a world, there is formation, existence, decay, and emptiness. Wherever there are living beings, there is birth, old age, sickness, and death. There is no world that is not destroyed, and no living being that can avoid birth, old age, sickness, and death. Ultimately, living beings and Buddhas are equal. Speaking of equality, everything is equal. Jesus spoke of universal love, but limited it to humanity, unable to extend it to all living beings. How can that be considered equality? The equality spoken of in Buddhism is that heaven, humans, and hell are equal, sentient and insentient beings are also equal. It is said, "Saints, ordinary beings, and all spirits belong to one family." In short, people must eliminate the mind of material competition before there can be true equality, before they can correct their minds and make their intentions sincere, and achieve the ultimate goal of enlightening the mind and seeing the nature.

### Safe Deposit Boxes at Allied Banks Mostly Opened; Those Not Opened Due to Renters Being Out of Shanghai

The safe deposit boxes at British and American banks such as Mercantile Bank of India, China and the Far East, J.P. Morgan & Co., and Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation have been opened one after another. According to the announced procedures, items are divided into two categories: those that are allowed to be withdrawn and those that are not. Since renters were allowed to bring their keys and apply for opening, according to a report by the Datong News Agency yesterday, Mercantile Bank, for example, has the most safe deposit boxes, with over 2,000 rented out. As of now, most of the renters have opened them. The very few who have not come to open them are likely because the renters are not in Shanghai. As for the number of safe deposit boxes at other Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, J.P. Morgan & Co., which is far fewer than at Mercantile Bank, most of the renters have also come to open them. Those who have not come to open them are likely because the renters are not in Shanghai.

Banque Belge pour l'Etranger Currently in the Process of Withdrawal

However, the opening of safe deposit boxes at Banque Belge pour l'Etranger is later, so some renters are still withdrawing them now. However, this bank does not have safe deposit boxes. The renters entrust the bank to manage their valuables, so there are no keys. The bank only issues a receipt, and items are withdrawn with the receipt. The procedures for items allowed to be withdrawn and those not allowed are the same as those announced by other British and American banks.

First National City Bank Not Yet Open

As of now, there is no news of the opening of safe deposit boxes at First National City Bank. However, the number of safe deposit boxes at this bank is also less than at Mercantile Bank. As for the procedures for opening the safe deposit boxes at this bank in the future, they will naturally be similar to those announced by other banks. As for the opening date, nothing has been heard yet.

### Exhibition on Gastroenterology

Exhibition on Gastroenterology, organized by Dr. Song Daren, is held to commemorate the 5th anniversary of the founding of Shanghai Gastroenterology Hospital, will be held on April 12th at the Aurora Museum. In addition to specially made models and various pathological specimens of gastrointestinal diseases, there is the latest invention of the gastroscope, which can explore the internal morphology. It can not only be seen with the naked eye, but also photographed. It not only reveals the lungs and liver, but also clearly reveals the knotting. There are also nearly a thousand pathological anatomy atlases, which show the complexity of gastrointestinal diseases. In the past, it was difficult to diagnose and treat. Now, with the help of science, it is not difficult to solve. Furthermore, the relationship between parasites and gastrointestinal diseases is significant. If one does not have in-depth research on parasites, it is impossible to diagnose and treat gastrointestinal diseases. The exhibition contains a very rich collection of parasite specimens. There are also lantern slides explaining the life history of insects and their host transmission routes, which are detailed and complete. Other atlases, books, papers, charts, etc. are too numerous to list.

Mr. Yang Bogeng, a prominent figure in the financial industry, will be the officiant. The bridegroom is excellent in character and academics, and the bride is beautiful and intelligent. Friends and relatives all praise them as a perfect match.

### A Match

— Wei Cai

Nine out of ten people who smoke cigarettes don't carry matches. In public places, on trams, when the urge to smoke suddenly arises, they don't first reach into their pockets for cigarettes, but rather scout around to see if there's a "source of fire" nearby. Sticking an unlit cigarette between their lips is both unsightly and internally a "tragedy." But why not carry a pack of matches? If you were to ask this question, nine out of ten wouldn't answer, but simply laugh it off. Thus, to smoke a cigarette, one must go through the two-step process of "borrowing fire" and "returning fire," as well as the two apologetic phrases of "excuse me" and "thank you." Habit becomes nature, and everyone follows suit.

Today, to the smokers' surprise, the cost of a single match is enough to equal the price of a Lao Dao brand cigarette in the past. If you still shamelessly ask a fellow smoker for a light, even if you manage to get your cigarette lit, the "procedure" is cumbersome and weighty enough. Smokers' posture is always with their eyes to the sky. When their ears hear "Excuse me, may I borrow a light," they have to lower their heads and see you holding a cigarette. With an awkward smile, the nerves on their cheeks immediately react, their eyebrows furrow, and the corners of their mouths twitch, as if they have "a belly full of resentment with nowhere to vent." At this moment, the person borrowing a light has to put on an even more smiling face to greet them. Three smiles can lead to marriage; after two smiles, they'll naturally give you some face. They'll take a deep drag of their cigarette, then tilt their head back and casually throw the burning end to you. They close their eyes, circulating the smoke throughout their digestive system, and exhale it slowly through their nostrils. – Only this puff of smoke offsets the trouble the borrower has given them. The saying "A cigarette in hand, all worries vanish" refers to having your own matches.

A box of matches costs one yuan and twenty cents, containing less than seventy matches. "Every shot counts," and you won't even use them seventy times. Including starting the stove and lighting candles at home, there's certainly no "remaining fire" to supply fellow smokers. I advise all smokers, when buying cigarettes, to first purchase matches. Otherwise, out of ten times borrowing a light, one will always lead to stomach problems.

The tightening of "fire sources" is bound to affect tea rooms, cafes, and dance halls. People who go to tea rooms and cafes originally do so to pass the time, and matches have become their most beloved objects. Picking off the heads to use as toothpicks is still a "legitimate" use. Using them to build various "intellectual puzzles," endlessly repeating, as one ends, another begins, a box of matches isn't enough for a few hours of diversion. A pot of fragrant tea costs eighty cents, and coffee is only sold for one yuan and a half. Businessmen's calculations are always rounded up, so the table is left with only ashtrays. According to a waiter at one café, the owner not only "has no fire on the table," but even the matches the waiters use to light customers' cigarettes are taken care of by the staff themselves.

Speaking of the targets of dancing friends, they are dance hostesses, enjoying themselves so much that they forget their fatigue, so cigarette expenses seem to be able to be reduced. But according to informal statisticians, the consumers of matches in dance halls are not the dance patrons, but the dance hostesses. Dance patrons are busy dancing and have no time to build "intellectual puzzles." Generally, "tangyuan dance hostesses" are terrified of being idle. If they can't "chat up" the dance patrons behind them, they have nothing to do but break matchsticks. Now, apart from a few first-class dance halls that slightly prepare three to five boxes of matches, other dance halls have adopted a "purchase twenty boxes of matches for one yuan" policy.

Now is truly a time when every thread and strand of material resources is difficult to obtain!

Yesterday's dispatch time was 6:45 PM

Yesterday, the black market price of silver bullion rose due to the slight recovery of silver shops. Market trends are strengthening. Dealers are still active in secret, but transactions are still scarce. Since morning, the initial transaction price per bar (ten taels) was still 18,650 yuan, with varying prices from securities firms. Silver shops were selling less, and the asking price was stable around 18,670 yuan. Until after 11:00, a certain securities firm sought and completed a transaction at 18,800 yuan. On the other hand, the price quoted on the phone was still 18,670 yuan. The final transaction price at 11:45 was 18,700 yuan, an increase of 50 yuan compared to the previous day.

Fine silver is listed at 18 yuan, and the black market price has risen to 13 yuan, 7 or 8 jiao. A silver dollar has also risen to 8 yuan and 3 jiao, with buyers but no sellers, it is said.

### Promissory Note Discount Rates Rising

Yesterday, the money industry association's interbank lending rate was still listed at 7 points. The discount rate for drafts and promissory notes was 35 yuan per thousand yuan, an increase of 5 yuan, it is said.

Since the Central Reserve Bank notes have been exchanged by Mongolia Bank, 800,000 chips are supplied for use every day. If there is no profit-seeking through exchange, the set exchange rate can be maintained, it is said.

### British and American Gold Dollars Rising Frequently

Yesterday, the foreign exchange market saw the British and American gold pounds each rise by 10 yuan, the former to 440 yuan and the latter to 450 yuan.

### Liquidation and Reorganization of Silver Shops

Since the war, many silver shops (small money houses) have sprung up in this city, especially along Sichuan Road and Jiangxi Road, specializing in futures trading of cotton yarn, silver bullion, US dollars, etc. Recently, they have been exchanging damaged banknotes and reserving drafts. Those with thriving businesses have annual surpluses of hundreds of thousands of yuan, while those who fail in speculation declare bankruptcy and liquidation. The recent silver shops that have announced liquidation, closure, reorganization, and transfer are listed below. Tongyi Silver Shop at No. 25 Tongfu Lane, Jing'an Temple Road, recently suffered from the absconding of its person in charge due to losses, resulting in insufficient economic turnover and inability to maintain operations, and has entrusted a lawyer to declare liquidation. Qitaiyong Silver Shop at Daoheng Building, the intersection of Ningbo Road and Jiangxi Road, suspended its business after the outbreak of the Pacific War and has now formally announced its closure. Jiuziyongji Zhuang at No. 201 Tianjin Road, 2nd floor, is transferring its business license and equipment to Jiufuniuji Zhuang to continue its business due to the partners' lack of intention to operate. Fuhua Money House at No. 187 Beijing Road has transferred all of its store base, equipment, and decorations to Gongda Silver Shop because it does not intend to continue operating.

### Government Bonds Slowly Rising

The off-market price of government bonds yesterday suddenly decreased significantly due to the selling by Da Kangcheng. Because the remaining companies also reduced selling, the short covering was more prevalent, and the market sentiment suddenly changed. The price rose slowly. With increasingly tight money supply, military notes, reserve notes, and cotton yarn all declined. The cash discount has reached more than 40 yuan. Government bonds, being used for drafts, have relatively looser funds. Most people saw that there were few sellers and covered their shorts. However, it is unknown what the purpose of temporarily stopping the sale of spot goods is. At the opening, Class C bonds were traded at 1 yuan and 1 jiao and once reached 1 yuan. Shunli, Huachang, and other companies significantly covered their shorts, and sellers temporarily took a wait-and-see attitude. Only Houde sold a little, but buyers were relatively bold. Buyers also began to raise prices. Class E bonds broke through 60 yuan. Class D bonds fell the most the day before, and their rebound was also rapid. Even if the future is promising, it is still limited. As a result, the market price uniformly rebounded by 6 or 7 jiao to 1 yuan and 6 jiao, with only Class A bonds improving by only 1 jiao. Approximately 700,000 to 800,000 yuan was traded. A simplified table is listed below.

Category, Highest, Lowest, Closing, Change from Previous Day
Class A Consolidated, 68.00, 67.60, 67.90, Up 0.10
Class B Consolidated, 62.90, 62.20, 62.90, Up 0.70
Class C Consolidated, 61.75, 61.00, 61.75, Up 0.65
Class D Consolidated, 57.70, 57.00, 57.70, Up 1.60
Class E Consolidated, 60.50, 59.70, 60.00, Up 0.90

### Eastern Cloth Falls Following Military Notes

Yesterday, cloth prices were generally unremarkable, but in terms of spot goods, they were still scarce. However, as Eastern cloth fell, buyers' appetite turned dull, and due to the weekend, transactions were even quieter. 16-pound Double Elephant coarse cloth was currently traded at 245 yuan, Earth at 220 yuan, 12-pound Dapeng fine cloth at 195 yuan, Fugui at 186 yuan, Chick Shilin at 290 yuan, Fuan cloth at 240 yuan, and Longevity Fuchou at 6 yuan and 4 jiao, all with small amounts traded.

### Overcoats are Being Hoarded

The market for wool fabrics has recently become even tighter, and the circulation of various winter and summer goods has gradually decreased. Seven or eight out of ten people at the public tea party wanted to buy, and few wanted to sell. Large stores with ample funds have always been buying in and not selling out, while hoarders are unwilling to come out of hiding, and the market is rising again. Even overcoats were being hoarded yesterday. Looking at the prices offered by the owners, the average unified prices were all half higher than last year. For example, American overcoats that sold for more than 70 yuan to 120 yuan per yard last year are now priced at 220 to 230 yuan. It is difficult to find three to five boxes to buy at once. It is said that the production of overcoats from this factory is scarcer than other wool fabrics, and the inventory is extremely scarce. It is expected that the price will have to rise by 50% to 60% in the cold winter.

### Rayon Sees New High Again

Yesterday, the rayon market was intensely bullish, with all goods hitting unprecedented new highs. In the morning, 120 Tianqiao (glossy small box) opened at 9,200 yuan and then revolved and held firm, closing at 9,310 yuan, up 240 yuan from the previous day. 75 Black Bird (semi-gloss large box) opened at 8,280 yuan.

The price of 200 Longevity Palace glossy small box has broken the 10,000 yuan mark.

### Sultry Weather: Domi Rice Slips Slightly Due to Fear of Deterioration

The weather was sunny and extremely sultry, and the peddlers in the suburbs seemed to fear that the goods they were carrying would suddenly deteriorate. It was rumored that the French Concession's pies fell from 411 yuan and 408 yuan to 403 or 5 yuan yesterday due to loose rice, and secondary goods were at 400 yuan. The British Concession's pies fell from 424 yuan to 420 yuan, and secondary goods were at 417 or 8 yuan.

### Daily Necessities Are Approaching Their End

The market for daily necessities presented a stalemate. Sales in all directions remained sluggish. Nine out of ten companies selling various goods had stopped selling.

### Soft Crackers Look Promising

The aroma and blanking of produced soft crackers are superior to those of this factory, but the color is sometimes inferior. They have been out of stock for a long time, and recently dozens of pieces have arrived and have already been sold out. It was rumored yesterday that dozens more pieces had arrived, which coincided with the high price of sugar in Shanghai, and the sales side had a great need for them. In addition, the cost of raw materials and other expenses has increased significantly, so the price must be high, it is said.

### Abalone is Expensive Because It is Rare

Abalone is the best of seafood, and its price is not inferior to that of fins. The current market price is as follows: Net abalone is at 10,000 yuan. The next largest Ming abalone is at 7,000 yuan, medium-sized abalone is at 6,000 yuan, and small-sized abalone is at 4,800 yuan. Freshly made canned abalone is at 1,000 yuan for a small size of six taels per can, and 600 yuan for a large size of four taels per can. There is not much stock in the market, so the price is very firm and elegant.

### Fish Skin and Fish Head Have Similar Prices

Fish skin and shark fin were originally the same product, and their taste is also in the same league. Therefore, fish skin is not willing to show weakness in the face of shark fin's high price. White fish skin male skin is currently at 2,500 yuan, and female skin is at 2,000 yuan. Male fish skin male skin is at the same price, and female skin is at 1,200 yuan. Fish head is at 2,200 yuan.

### Galangal Has Goods on the Way

Galangal was originally a common medicinal material, but the source has been extremely scarce since the incident, so old goods of many years have been sold at good prices. The remaining stock is increasingly scarce, and the rising trend is increasingly intense, with an increase of one or two hundred yuan. It has been checked that goods on the way have already been shipped out, but it is said that the number is small, and it is difficult to loosen the price.

### Small Fennel Has a Not-So-Small Market Price

The price of small fennel has been gradually rising recently due to the small amount of sources. It was checked that it opened at 300 yuan at the beginning of last month and has recently risen to 550 yuan. It is rumored that there are dozens of newly arrived packages from the customer side, and the asking price is even higher, but it has not yet been traded.

Family

### We Must Be Optimistic

— Ji Chou

It can be said that it is a common situation that many families who have not been living in a harmonious atmosphere are beginning to crack step by step under the unprecedented rise in living standards. What an unfortunate and terrible thing this is!

Husbands and wives, parents and children, the hearts of each other are indeed gradually estranged; although their bodies are still together day and night. And some even have the only thread of connection destroyed; they begin to be dissatisfied, complaining, attacking and even quarreling.

Why is this? Are siblings really willing to abandon the happiness of the family regardless? We doubt it! We should look for the reason why this situation is happening so commonly.

High prices - this is naturally the main reason, the husband's production is limited, income is not enough to cover expenses, and it is difficult to maintain the household. (Especially for those with many children). Maybe they have to worry about tomorrow after today, and worry about the next meal after the last meal. Therefore, there is no joy in the family, and no leisure to talk and laugh; so all day long is filled with depression and anger, and they grab at little things to vent the boredom in their chests. The wife's resentment and the husband's disgust grow quickly!

Environmental temptation - Shanghai was originally an evil city, and with the increase of unscrupulous merchants who hoard goods and make fortunes, there is poverty on one side and debauchery and extravagance on the other. Some people with weaker wills are easily bewitched by vanity; seeing others enjoying delicacies and fine clothes, they often have a sense of contempt for their own family, which is mired in sorrow, and eventually some unfortunate events occur.

Fear of unemployment - Unemployment is a real problem that urgently needs to be solved! How many people end their lives with their own hands because of it! How many happy families are broken because of it! Assaults, runaways, divorces... It not only destroys the harmonious atmosphere in the family: it also sends promising and middle-aged people to unimaginable paths.

Well, these three points are enough. And we can clearly see who is to blame! Can money really buy happiness? Can money really control everything? No! We must resolutely deny it!

A happy family still depends on each other's harmony, sharing weal and woe, and the spirit of tolerance, struggle, and determination to fight to the end against the vicious clutches of life. Because living in these difficult days, pointless quarrels not only do not help in practice, but also accelerate the division and collapse of the family.

We are poor, we are suffering, but we must be optimistic!

### Is a Large Family with Many Children a Blessing? Or a Burden?

— Qiu Lang

In the past, Chinese families always envied "a house full of descendants" and "a thriving family." If someone formed a family and, after eight or ten years, had no children, the family would feel monotonous, lonely, and lacking in interest. Even the couple would resent each other. The husband, concerned about the continuation of the family line, would take concubines, hoping to have a son soon. In middle age, they would cherish their children, and in old age, they would enjoy the grandchildren around their knees, considering it the happiness of life.

But it's different now. For middle and lower-class families with many children, there is panic over food and the difficulty of buying coal briquettes, and the family is almost on the verge of running out of food! Because they can only ration three pints of rice per week (foreign rice is sold every Monday, Wednesday, and Saturday, with one pint rationed each time), even porridge is not enough to share. The crying of children is a pitiful sight that is difficult to describe! And other daily necessities are soaring in price, and the children's education expenses are even more unbearable. It is difficult for parents to fulfill the expensive task of raising children, and they are endlessly burdened! How can they talk about happiness?

Therefore, in the current tense situation, families do not need to feel lonely for not having children. On the contrary, having no children is a blessing, and having many children brings more worries. Succession is another issue, not to be discussed today. Moreover, we can greatly promote Mrs. Sanger's birth control doctrine, which is truly an outstanding and timely measure.

### Coal Briquettes That Won't Burn

— Compass

Coal briquettes have risen to thirty yuan per load, and surprisingly, you can buy them. Everyone is raising their hands in celebration. Although purchases are still restricted, there is no fear of running out of fuel, easing half of our worries.

Yesterday, my family delivered a load of coal briquettes, but they won't burn properly at all. After burning the coal briquettes, they remain whole, clogging the bottom of the stove and extinguishing the fire. You have to light the fire three or four times a day, which is extremely troublesome. Lunch takes three or four hours to cook.

The reason why the coal briquettes don't burn well is probably because they contain too much yellow mud. Once burned, the mud hardens into clumps. So, if you break them up, the soil becomes looser, and the surface area also increases, making it easier to ignite and burn hotter. After trying it, it actually improved somewhat.

Housewives must be troubled by these coal briquettes that won't burn. Then, you might as well try this.

### Wall Temperature and Cleanliness

— Sizhong

If you want to keep the walls of your house clean, you should maintain their temperature. An expert once used an electric thermometer to measure the temperature of the walls. According to his experimental results, the cooler the walls, the easier they become dirty.

Originally, the higher the temperature inside the house, the faster the molecules of oxygen and nitrogen in the air move. When the walls are warm, there is a layer of warmer air near them, so the oxygen and nitrogen molecules in that area move faster than the same molecules in the center of the room. As a result, the dust in the room is blown away, preventing it from sticking to the walls. If the temperature in the room is higher than the temperature of the walls, the molecules near the walls move slower, so dust is attracted to the walls. We can see proof of this on walls with wainscoting. Wainscoting maintains temperature more easily than plaster, so the part of the wall with wainscoting is slightly warmer than the gaps in the plaster, and most of the dust in the room is attracted to the colder plastered parts, so a pattern of wooden boards appears on the wall.

### A Week's Home Menu

— Ms. Hua Ying

Alfalfa, commonly known as grass head, also known as golden flower vegetable, is one of the best vegetables. There is a small Huzhou restaurant in this city that is famous for its specialty of stir-fried grass head. Recently, new grass head has come on the market, and it only costs 40 cents per pound. In this year when all kinds of meat and vegetarian dishes are expensive, this price is considered very cheap. For meat dishes, it is best to pair it with braised four joy meatballs or Zhenjiang-style lion's head. Use grass head as the base, and after the meat oil permeates, it is very delicious to eat, especially when the new grass head is tender, it is truly indescribably delicious! As for vegetarian preparations, there is only one way to stir-fry it, but the oil must be used generously, otherwise it will not taste good, and some sorghum wine must also be added. If you find it monotonous, you can use dried tofu strips as an auxiliary ingredient.

### What To Do After a Divorce?

— Zuying

Divorce. Why would a perfectly fine woman want to get divorced? Isn't divorce a very unfortunate thing? Yes, but I am divorced. You ask me why I'm so heartless? Please forgive me for not saying the reason. I don't need to repeat the discrimination of my in-laws and the abuse of my husband. But I can say that I divorced out of necessity.

What to do after a divorce? Live in my parents' home for the rest of my life? Of course, I won't! I don't have children dragging me down, and I'm only twenty-four years old, so naturally I'm capable of doing something.

That's right, I can take the first path you can most easily imagine, find a job, and achieve independence. But as a woman who hasn't even graduated from high school (note: a woman), where is there a place for you to squeeze in? To get hold of a decent job is simply harder than ascending to heaven. This can be proved by my attempts over the past six months. So, I should settle for selling my looks? I don't want to do that yet.

The second path is to read and write and continue my studies. But let me tell you, not to mention that I don't have the mood, even if I do, I still feel depressed after reading. The inner pain still cannot be resolved. It turns out that I am no exception. I need physical comfort! Speaking of this, I remembered that a male relative told me some time ago that I should have some proper leisure activities and not let my life be too dull, so he invited me to see a movie a few times. Oh dear, that's not good. The relatives are treating this as news! They have become voluntary propagandists, spreading the word far and wide, saying that a good horse doesn't eat grass from where it's been, and a good woman doesn't marry a man who is too tall. They are saying that I shouldn't be seducing innocent men! Alas, what can my mouth say to defend myself?

So, as for the third path, remarriage, I don't have the courage for that. Thinking of the relatives' venomous words, even if I have a very good reason, I dare not help but say, "Public opinion is formidable."

What is the difference between a woman's remarriage and a man's second marriage? Why do you single out my faults? Why don't men show sympathy and help for my situation? Who says that a divorced woman doesn't have more passion to repay him? Who says that my personality and soul are no longer noble, honest, and pure? Why don't you see this point and look down on me? Does a man lose his face and status by marrying a divorced woman? There are many women my age who haven't married yet!

Ah! Can you believe it? I have already attempted suicide twice, once before the divorce and once after being humiliated by relatives and friends.

I am now preparing for my third suicide. I hope that this time it will be very smooth, very quick, and successfully without any pain!

### Small Tips for Refreshing Utensils

— Jin Yuanshi

Goldware: Hardware stores and silversmiths sell gold polishing cloths and gold polishing oil. If goldware is old, it can be restored to a bright yellow color after polishing. It is also effective to use ordinary white cloth dipped in alcohol and chamois leather for polishing.

Silverware: Gold polishing cloths and oil can also be used. If you think they are expensive, you can use toothpaste or alcohol dipped in a cloth for fine polishing.

Bronze ware: Bronze comes in four types: yellow, white, green, and purple. All are prone to verdigris. In addition to commercially available bronze polishing oil, you can dissolve soap water or soda water and immerse the bronze ware in the water for washing. Another method: dip a cloth in coal ash (mixed with a little water) and scrub vigorously.

Ironware: Ironware is prone to rust when it comes into contact with water and oil stains, so ironware should never be left with water. Refreshing methods: scrubbing with soda water, rice straw ash, rice bran, or bean cake can all make it black and shiny, as good as new for many years. For items that have been stored for a long time, it is advisable to apply sesame oil or vegetable oil to prevent rust.

Pottery and porcelain: If dirt has accumulated on pottery and porcelain for a long time, it is not easy to wipe away. Rub the dirty areas with salt, then wash with hot water, and the dirt will be removed.

### Library of Forbidden Books

— He Kai

The British Museum in London has a unique section dedicated to forbidden books. It collects all the forbidden books from around the world, and can be said to be the most complete "forbidden book library." These books are temporarily or permanently banned from sale for political reasons or due to their sexually explicit content.

Here you can find Wilde's "De Profundis," Lawrence's "The Rainbow" and "Lady Chatterley's Lover," and Ellis's "Studies in the Psychology of Sex," an authority on sexual psychology. Modern novels include James Hanley's "Boy," etc.

The banning of "Boy" is quite peculiar. It was published in 1931 and reprinted twice, and a cheap edition was published in May 1934. It was at this time that the customs authorities confiscated the book from a local library and filed a public lawsuit against the author.

Among the books recently banned is one written by Alexandro Kotti. When his work was banned, he actually attempted suicide; but the god of fate played a trick at the critical moment, bringing him back to the world from the Yellow Springs. Soon after, his book was republished in the United States, earning him a fortune in six months, so Kotti plucked up the courage to embark on the journey of life again.

The original version of Wilde's "De Profundis" is completely different from the version that people usually read. The banned version only appeared in bookstores for a day or two, and then it was sent to court as evidence.

In addition to collecting forbidden books, the British Museum also houses manuscripts that are forbidden from being printed. If these manuscripts were published now, they would cause adverse reactions from all sides. First, we can mention a certain diary kept by a diplomat. This diary records behind-the-scenes conspiracies of international political situations and the private affairs of important people, so it can never be published before it loses its relevance.

It usually has to be kept here for fifty years. If stored elsewhere, this diary or document would be quite dangerous. But here, it can be said to be foolproof, because no one can easily take a peek at it.

The correspondence of the great British writer Dickens is also safely stored here. After her father's death, Dickens's daughter tried her best to preserve his letters, and finally consulted with Shaw. He introduced her to send it to the forbidden manuscript collection department, where it can be kept secret for at least fifty years. What exactly is written in these letters is quite an interesting question.

In the forbidden book section, there are many books that ordinary people would be surprised to see, because to them, these books are too much like classics to be banned. Similarly, the forbidden manuscript section is also full of surprises. And which of these manuscripts, once published, will cause a sensation?
