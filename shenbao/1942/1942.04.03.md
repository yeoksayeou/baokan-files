### Stalemated Anglo-Indian Negotiations: Rumors of US Mediation; Congress Resolution Still Unpublished; Cripps Striving to Overcome Difficulties

Washington, 2nd (Havas) – The Washington Post today stated that President Roosevelt may step in to mediate the Indian question. The liberation of India has long been the hope of the American people, and Indian leaders deeply understand that American mediation would not raise concerns in India. Judging from India's attitude, it seems that it would rather achieve nothing than compromise on every point. However, such an attitude seems unwise at a time when India feels threatened.

Washington, 1st (Havas) – President Roosevelt met with India's representative to the United States, Babbé, tonight to discuss the political situation in India and the possibility of the Indian National Congress rejecting British proposals.

Lisbon, 2nd (Haitong Agency) – President Roosevelt is reportedly considering mediating the Indian issue. Well-informed sources in Washington believe that two facts indicate this trend: first, Sir Babbé, the Indian representative, met with President Roosevelt yesterday for a lengthy two-hour discussion, but afterwards refused to disclose the contents of the conversation to reporters; second, Washington newspapers have strongly argued that President Roosevelt should mediate the Indian issue. It is reported that Sir Babbé said that Sir Cripps's proposal is worthy of detailed study, the implication being particularly intriguing.

Washington, 1st (Reuters) – India's representative to the US, Bajjé, met with President Roosevelt yesterday for two hours. After the meeting, he told reporters, "I believe Cripps's proposal is more progressive than any previous proposal and deserves careful consideration." President Roosevelt discussed the functions of the Pacific War Council with me and did not touch upon Anglo-Indian relations. When asked whether Indian leaders seemed to have decided to reject Cripps's proposal, Bajjé replied in the affirmative, but added, "I still hope this matter can be resolved satisfactorily in the end."

Lisbon, 2nd (Alliance Agency) – According to reports from Washington, British efforts to persuade India to accept Cripps's proposals seem destined to fail. Therefore, there is a growing opinion in Washington that the United States should mediate the Indian issue. The Washington Post published an article yesterday advocating that President Roosevelt should act as a mediator. The article stated, "India's rejection of British proposals forces the American people to the almost inescapable conclusion that suspicions of Britain cannot be dispelled. This is the reason why other allied countries should take action. India's demands seem unbelievable." However, India's relapse into internal strife with Britain is an obstacle to victory. If the United States mediates, it will not be suspected.

New Delhi, 1st (Havas) – Sir Stafford Cripps's plan for India to become a dominion after the war has been rejected by the Indian National Congress and the Maha Sabha Party. The Maha Sabha Party's executive committee also issued a lengthy statement detailing several points in Sir Cripps's proposal that are still acceptable. However, Sir Cripps had previously stated that the British proposal must be accepted or rejected in its entirety, without any changes. Since the key points of the plan are now unacceptable, the Maha Sabha Party has no other option but to reject it.

New Delhi, 2nd (Reuters) – The Standing Committee of the Indian National Congress discussed the proposals regarding India's future constitution submitted by British envoy Sir Stafford Cripps for four and a half hours yesterday and will continue the discussion this morning. According to the party chairman, Achart Kuan, he is scheduled to meet with Cripps at 4:30 p.m. today. However, it is rumored that when Achart meets with Cripps today, he may inform him of the party's Standing Committee's resolution, stating the reasons for opposing the British proposal. The contents of this resolution may be announced tonight. In addition, the Standing Committee of the Indian Church has already issued a lengthy statement, stating that several points in Cripps's declaration are still barely satisfactory, but it is unfortunate that the British proposal must be accepted or rejected completely. Since several key points of the British proposal are difficult to accept in whole or in part, the Indian Church has no choice but to reject it. As for what the Indian Church finds difficult to agree with, one is the political division of India; the second is the lack of detailed information on how to handle the transition period in the British proposal; and the third is the defense issue. As for the statement issued by the National Congress in the Central Assembly, it stated that the British proposal is inadequate to meet the needs of the current situation in many aspects and poses more dangers to the future of India. For the sake of the Indian National Congress, the only option is to reject it.

New Delhi, 2nd (Reuters) – Cripps is scheduled to meet with representatives of the Council of Princes tonight.

New Delhi, 2nd (Reuters) – The resolution of the Standing Committee of the Indian National Congress may not be published immediately. It is expected that Cripps will make further efforts over the next few days to overcome various difficulties after receiving the Congress's letter of rejection. It is expected that when Mr. Cripps receives the resolution of the National Congress, if he implies that the British side welcomes the National Congress to submit a counter-proposal, then the National Congress may submit a counter-proposal to the British side.

New Delhi, 2nd (Havas) – British special envoy to India Sir Stafford Cripps has just officially stated that he originally planned to return home on the 6th of this month, but has now decided to postpone his return. The difficulties he has encountered in negotiations with representatives from all walks of life in India have gradually decreased, and he believes that some progress can be expected within the next week.

American Mediation Should Be Successful

Washington, 2nd (Reuters) – The Washington Post's editorial today stated that President Roosevelt may try to explore the possibility of mediating the Indian issue and that the United States sympathizes with India's aspirations. If President Roosevelt makes a proposal for mediation, India will not doubt the goodwill of the United States, because the United States has always been concerned about the issue of India's liberation, and the Indian people are well aware of this. As for China, it will also support the President's efforts. This is even more important, because China has made concrete suggestions to Britain. The British proposal is a demonstration of what the allied countries urgently need to express. If India cannot coordinate internally, the future of the war will inevitably be affected. In any case, Washington firmly holds this view. Regarding the defense issue, the British concessions to India stipulate that India can send representatives to participate in the British War Cabinet, as in the case of Australia's Gasser. In this way, India can express its opinions on war issues, but the Indian people do not have a clear understanding of this. The view of the Indian Church is that the British side must accept all of its opinions, and any compromise solution is difficult to accept. In fact, under the current circumstances, this attitude is unwise.

Congress Party's Rejection Resolution

New Delhi, 2nd (Reuters) – It is rumored that the issues discussed in the Congress Party's resolution to reject the British War Cabinet plan include: one, the part about defense; two, granting each province the freedom not to participate in the future Indian Federation; and three, the method for Indian states to send representatives to participate in the formulation of the constitutional system.

New Delhi, 2nd (Reuters) – The full text of the resolution of the Standing Committee of the Congress Party rejecting the British Cabinet's proposal will not be published immediately. It is expected that Cripps will continue his efforts in the coming days to complete the work of overcoming difficulties after receiving the exact wording of the Congress Party's resolution of opposition. Approximately, after Mr. Cripps receives the resolution, if he expresses a welcome for counter-proposals, the Congress Party will prepare such counter-proposals and submit them to Mr. Cripps within a reasonable time.

Suggesting the Organization of Anglo-Indian Allied Forces

Washington, 1st (Havas) – Senator Connally, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, proposed last night that Britain immediately organize a joint Anglo-Indian command headquarters, because he believes that under the current circumstances, defending India is the most urgent task. After the establishment of the Anglo-Indian Joint Command, the anti-British sentiment in India can be eliminated. Although the US government is very pessimistic about the Anglo-Indian negotiations, it believes that Britain will be able to make concessions on several points, and at the same time hopes that Indian leaders can also make corresponding concessions. In short, I still hope that Special Envoy Cripps' trip can reach a compromise.

Indians Demand the Transfer of Power

New Delhi, 1st (United Press) – According to well-informed sources, Cripps has now issued an "urgent plea for help" to the British Cabinet, explaining the reactions of various political parties. Cripps stated therein that all circles in India unanimously demand that Indians be appointed as members of the National Defense Committee. If the British side can agree to this point, it may be possible to change the attitude of various circles to reject the British proposal. The leaders of the Nationalist Party, Sapru and Jayakar, issued a statement urging the British side to appoint Indians as members of the National Defense Committee, which may be the source of the above rumors. The current fact is that if Britain does not agree to modify the proposal, the All India National Congress will never accept the proposal. Other political parties, such as the Muslim League, also believe that if the National Congress rejects the proposal, then they do not need to consider the proposal. The Indian princes are also reacting poorly because the various points related to them in the proposal have not been clearly explained. It is reported that Gandhi and Nehru did not engage in drafting the statement of the National Congress. This task is now being handled by Balla Chari, the former Prime Minister of Madras Province. Cha is a moderate pro-British member of the Standing Committee of the National Congress. This point can indicate that the statement of the National Congress will contain detailed reasoning and concrete counter-proposals.

New Delhi, 1st (Reuters) – The person in charge of the Indian Hindu Maha Sabha stated that if the Maha Sabha today endorses any proposal that would cause any form or method of political division in India, it would violate its original intention and endanger the interests of India. The power of any province not to participate in the Federation is not allowed by the principle of self-determination, and such power must never be formulated by external authorities. India is now a unified country, and the existing provinces are all administratively united. Today, the situation of a sovereign country joining the Federation, or the situation of a sovereign country sacrificing part of its sovereignty for its common purpose, is not applicable to the provinces of India. The Maha Sabha's concern for all the future concerns mentioned in the declaration is that the Maha Sabha demands whether Britain is willing to immediately transfer power to India. India should immediately be declared an independent country and enjoy a free and equal position under the United Nations of Britain. The declaration guarantees that India will be given full national rights in the future, but the constitutional status of India during the transition period is not explained. Our national defense plan is especially unacceptable.

The Liberal Party is Seeking a Compromise

New Delhi, 2nd (Reuters) – A standing member of the Congress Party chatted with reporters today and expressed some disagreement with the British proposal. However, according to his observation of the current talks, it is very similar to the negotiations in 1931, when Gandhi and Lord Irwin (now Lord Halifax) conducted negotiations. After the initial seven days of suspicion and disappointment, they were finally able to sign a treaty. According to observations, some people, such as Liberal Party leaders Sapru and Jayakar, are now doing their best to seek a compromise. At the same time, the Standing Committee of the Muslim Congress has not yet revealed its intentions. Qin Na, the chairman of the Muslim Congress, who had dinner with Cripps yesterday, is now maintaining complete silence. The general feeling is that the future development of the negotiations will depend on Mr. Cripps's reaction to the Congress Party's letter and what concessions Mr. Cripps and Britain are prepared to make to meet the views of the Congress Party.

Britain Provides an Explanation

London, 2nd (Reuters) – The London Times today commented on the Indian comments on the British proposal under the title "(The Last Moment)". It is said that Special Envoy Cripps carried two proposals on this trip to India. One is very clear and concerns the status of India after the war. The second concerns the measures during the wartime transition period, and its content is inevitably somewhat vague. If the main point of the Indian National Congress's rejection is the second proposal, then we clearly know that they can still accept the core of the proposal. The Indian demand that the right to defend India should be immediately transferred to Indians actually needs to be further explained. In these troubled times, General Wavell's appointment as Commander-in-Chief of the Indian Army is of practical benefit, and the American general today is also the commander of the Australian region, and his headquarters is located in Australia. When Wavell commanded the ABD defense zone in the past, the troops of several countries were under his command, but Wavell himself had to report to Washington. From this point of view, Wavell's position in India does not contain any contempt for India. If the Indian side agrees that Wavell maintains his current position to continue to be responsible to the War Council, the Indian side can also send representatives to attend the meeting. The issue of appointing Indians to positions in the British government, such as Minister of the Army, is also open to discussion. In short, General Wavell's task of implementing the overall strategy is very clear and should not be interfered with. Today's responsibility lies with the National Congress and other Indian spokesperson agencies. They should clearly express their judgment on the British proposal.

### Skirmishes in Batangas; Japanese Army Shells US Positions; Corregidor Island Also Attacked

Washington, 2nd (Reuters) – According to the Army Department, there were only skirmishes on the Batangas Peninsula of the Philippines. Japanese warships also shelled US positions on the west coast of the peninsula, and the US front lines were bombed by Japanese dive bombers. The Corregidor Island fortress in Manila Bay was also attacked by Japanese aircraft from time to time. In the afternoon, Japanese artillery units on the Cavite coast also opened fire and shelled it. Earlier, Japanese infantry units had launched a fierce attack on US outposts around 8:00 p.m. on the 31st of last month. After a fierce bayonet fight, several US outposts were captured.

Washington, 1st (Reuters) – The Army Department issued the following communiqué based on information obtained before 9:00 a.m. this morning: In the Philippines, Japanese infantry launched a frontal attack on our army's defense line at 8:00 p.m. on the 31st. The Japanese army attacked our outer perimeter several times under the cover of mortar fire. The two sides fought hand-to-hand for several hours. Yesterday, Japanese aircraft bombed Corregidor Fortress in batches of two.

Tokyo, 2nd (Alliance Agency) – The Japanese General Headquarters announced at 3:20 p.m. today that the Japanese naval air force had bombed Coranhetekoko from March 24 to March 31, destroying the US and Philippine military high-射 artillery positions on the island and thoroughly destroying the airport barracks and official residences.

### Axis Submarines Sunk: Over Twenty Vessels

Washington, 1st (Reuters) – A US Navy spokesman said that a total of 21 Axis submarines had been sunk by the US Navy, 19 of which were sunk in the Atlantic and two in Pearl Harbor, including the three submarines recently sunk by the US Navy.

New York, 1st (Reuters) – Rear Admiral Simons, commander of the US East Coast naval station, declared that as a result of the Axis submarines' activities along the Atlantic coast, the submarines and personnel had paid a heavy price. Simons further stated that the submarine activity in the Atlantic is the worst threat we have suffered. The number of submarines operating on the coastal seas will be greatly reduced by US aircraft attacks.

### Gibraltar Bombed the Day Before Yesterday

Gibraltar, 1st (Havas) – A small squadron of aircraft flew over here before dawn tonight, taking advantage of the bright moonlight, and dropped bombs, but there were no casualties or losses on the ground. The local high-射 artillery unit immediately opened fire and drove them away. The air raid alert lasted for an hour and a half before it was lifted. Afterwards, according to the official communiqué, the enemy aircraft dropped many bombs, but there were no casualties or losses. According to reports, since the British port of Gibraltar was attacked by Italian bomber groups in July 1941, this is the first time the port has been bombed by enemy aircraft.

### Buddhist Burma (Part 1)

Burma is our country's southwestern neighbor, its territory interlocked with our country's border like dogs' teeth, and its people share the same kind of kinship with our country. The characteristics of Burma, in addition to the towering coconuts, trees, and mangoes, are the golden and resplendent pagodas scattered throughout Burma, followed by the bald-headed monks in yellow robes. Burma is commonly known for its three abundances: "one monk, two pagodas, and three crows." It turns out that the Burmese people worship Buddhism, and in addition, Burma is an agricultural economic society, with abundant natural agricultural products, which gives them the constant strength to pursue spiritual life.

The Burmese people have healthy physiques, lively expressions, gentle hearts, and are charitable and generous, without accumulating wealth. Once they have money left over, they will subsidize Buddhist temples. From a young age, their spirits are nurtured by Buddhism, "believing that life is like crossing a sea of suffering," so they enjoy life to the fullest and live happily ever after.

The Burmese people are accustomed to worshiping pagodas, or going to temples to listen to Dharma masters' lectures, or sitting quietly in one place to read scriptures. Wealthy people build temples and pagodas, while poor people install water tanks and repair bridges by the roadside to benefit travelers and create blessings for the afterlife. The Burmese people believe in Buddhism (which has been selected as the state religion since ancient times). The Three Treasures of Buddhism—Sakyamuni, the Dharma, and the Sangha—are worshiped most devoutly. From infancy, mothers instill religious education in their children through lullabies, and Burmese women are especially devout. They worship the Buddha and pray in the morning, then give alms to monks, and in the evening, they must offer flowers and pray before the Buddha. These are simply the obligations that Burmese women believe are natural and righteous.

Not only do ordinary Burmese people believe in Buddhism in this way, but let's also look at King Mindon Min. He was generally quiet during his 20-year reign. He was a wise monarch in history. He was usually silent and spoke little, but when he did speak, it was good words—words that taught people to believe in Buddhism and cultivate goodness.

Pagodas Scattered Throughout the Territory

According to Swinnerton's "The Burmese's View of Life," "There is no reward for merit greater than building a pagoda." Therefore, in Burma, whether noble or lowly, everyone takes pleasure in building pagodas and temples. Some use public funds, spending vast sums of money, while others economize on food and clothing, gathering little by little, to achieve their goals. As a result, the pagodas of Burma are scattered throughout the territory. Travelers going up the Irrawaddy River can see the cone-shaped pagodas scattered like stars on the mountain peaks along the banks, vying for beauty. Their brilliant and harmonious colors, their tranquil and gentle yet elegant posture, accompanied by the harmonious chimes of the bells, how can they not make people empty of all thoughts and envy them endlessly! It is said that someone has roughly estimated that if the pagodas scattered throughout Burma were arranged in a vertical line, they could start from Hlegu, near Yangon, and extend all the way beyond Myitkyina in the far north. In other words, the line of pagodas could run through the entire territory of Burma from north to south with some to spare. The number is unimaginable.

The Burmese call pagodas "Zedi," which can be divided into four types: "Khaung-dú" Zedi are built on top of Buddhist relics or their models; "Paribawga" Zedi are built on top of eight kinds of divine objects or their models; "Aw-tá" Zedi contain Buddha statues; and "Damma-káya" (i.e., Buddha's teachings) Zedi contain Buddhist scriptures.

The location of the pagodas is mostly near mountains and rivers, and they are surrounded by lush mangoes, tall palm trees, and bananas with huge leaves. In such an environment, whenever the morning sun rises, or the evening glow slants, or on a moonlit night, the golden, shimmering buildings emit smiling reflections in the green embrace, and the beautiful reflections are submerged in the mirror-like water, also adorned with red lotus buds and green lotus leaves. The gentle chimes of the bells from the top of the pagoda are carried by the breeze, mixed with the monks' rhythmic chanting of scriptures in the temple. How can this scene not make people's minds wander!

The pagoda is a solid building, and one cannot climb to its top for a bird's-eye view, but can only admire it at the foot of the pagoda. The materials used to build the pagoda are bricks, limestone, and the exterior is coated with gold powder or lime. The shape of the pagodas is mostly bell-shaped, such as the Shwedagon Pagoda in Yangon. Its exquisite elegance is enough to be appreciated. The top of the pagoda also has five or seven layers of small copper pagodas, like a copper umbrella, with carved flowers and plants, hanging with small bells and cymbals. When the breeze blows, they make a jingling sound. The top of the small copper pagoda is a diamond core, which is replaced by glass bottles in poor areas. This has two meanings: one is to resemble the shape of a lotus stamen, because according to the Buddhist scriptures, when Sakyamuni was in his mother Maya's body, he resembled a lotus stamen; and the other is to avoid lightning. Another important thing is that no matter what pagoda it is, it must contain a certain amount of sacred objects, otherwise the top of the pagoda cannot be opened. On the platform of the pagoda is a chapel for those who pray, with many large Buddhas, and inside there is one or several Buddha statues. In front of it, groups of Burmese people are making devout prayers. Next to the pagoda, in the temple, there is a kind of large bell, suspended in a corner of the temple, with a crossbar in the middle of the top, about a foot above the ground. The time to strike the bell is before and after prayers, striking with a corner. The sound is said to be able to invite the gods of heaven and earth to pay attention to their sincere prayers. Nearby, there must be a release pond, where aquatic animals such as fish, shrimp, and turtles are released.

Next to the pagoda is a monastery attached to it, the decoration of which is no less than that of other temples. There is also a nunnery, which is less luxurious than the monastery.

The guesthouse for pilgrims is often connected to the monastery, specially for pilgrims who have come from afar to rest. Anyone can stay inside, and the Burmese people generally do not have hotels, so they often go there for the night. Poor travelers regard it as a good place to stay.

Burma has two famous pagodas: one is the world-famous Shwedagon Pagoda in Yangon, and the other is the most unique Kyaiktiyo Pagoda in all of Burma.

The Shwedagon Pagoda is not only famous throughout Burma, but also the most sacred and beautiful Buddhist temple in the Indochina Peninsula. This pagoda was built in the 16th century. It is 368 feet high, 118 feet higher than the Wat Arun in Siam, 68 feet higher than the Statue of Liberty in New York, and 120 feet lower than the highest pyramid in Egypt. This pagoda was only 27 feet high at first, but after seven renovations, it has become today's magnificent structure. The pagoda is solid and covered with gold powder. At the top is a weather vane, and below it is a gold umbrella weighing more than a ton, which was offered by King Mindon Min. There are 15,000 suspended bells above and below, of which more than 100 are made of gold and the rest are made of silver. The weather vane and the diamond lotus stamen are inlaid with 3,664 rubies, 511 emeralds, and 433 diamonds. It is truly worthy of being the king of pagodas.

The Kyaiktiyo Pagoda is built on a mountain range 10 miles away from Kyaikto (about 105 miles by car from Yangon). The mountain road is rugged and winding, and there are several places where the steep walls are vertical and there is no way to pass. Wooden ladders are provided to climb up, which is extremely dangerous. The Kyaiktiyo Pagoda is built on a large stone at the top of the mountain. The circumference of the stone is about 500-600 feet, weighing hundreds of thousands of pounds. Its lower part is in the shape of an acute angle, falling on a tall stone plate. People who want to go under the round stone must pass a wooden bridge. If tourists push the round stone, it will shake from side to side, but the pagoda stands firmly as before. This strange ancient architecture, which applies ingenious mechanics, is worthy of admiration.

### The Trial of the Attempted Assassination of Von Papen Begins; Defendant Saiman Confesses to the Crime

Istanbul, 2nd (Havas News Agency) The Turkish Supreme Court began the trial yesterday morning for the attempted assassination of the German Ambassador to Turkey, Von Papen, on February 24th. The defendants are as follows: Saiman, a student; Sagor, a barber. Both are Turkish citizens, born in Yugoslavia. Kanilov, a Soviet citizen, handles commercial affairs at the Soviet Consulate General. Pavloff, a Soviet citizen. Before the trial began, there were many spectators around the court, with military police deployed to maintain order and prevent demonstrations. The defendants were brought to the court by car half an hour before the trial. The public gallery was extremely crowded. The court issued admission tickets, and only special correspondents were sent as representatives from Turkish and foreign journalists.

Brief Biographies of the Accused

Ankara, 2nd (Havas News Agency) Details have been ascertained regarding the trial of the four defendants in the attempted assassination of the German Ambassador to Turkey, Von Papen. Defendant Pavloff was born in Macedonia and is a member of the IMRO revolutionary party. He went to Moscow to join a terrorist group and claims to be a Soviet citizen. Saiman was born in 1907 and came to Turkey from Toulai three years ago. Sagor was born in 1917 and has resided in Turkey for three years. Kanilov is the head of the commercial affairs section of the Soviet Consulate in Istanbul. At the start of the trial, Pavloff denied being born in Macedonia, claiming he was from Chita in Siberia and was a historian. Saiman accused Kanilov and Pavloff of being the masterminds of the case. He claimed to be a Muslim with no connection to the Communist Party. He later met a woman named Anna and was enticed into the Communist Party. To sever his relationship with the woman, his parents sent him back to Istanbul from Belgrade University. Subsequently, he traveled from Istanbul to Yugoslavia several times, delivering documents to the Soviet Embassy in Ankara, and met Kanilov and Pavloff several times in Istanbul, receiving remuneration each time, specifically payment for providing information to the Bulgarian Soviet Embassy. He was introduced to Stephen by Pavloff. Stephen fled to Syria after the incident (the Turkish Foreign Ministry has requested extradition). Previously, he was a member of the Communist Party, but hated Soviet ideology after a friend was killed. Saiman confessed to the crime, requesting the death penalty. He is willing to provide a full confession. At this point, the court adjourned until the afternoon.

Afternoon Continuation of the Trial

Istanbul, 2nd (Havas News Agency) Yesterday afternoon, the trial for the attempted assassination of Von Papen continued. Defendant Saiman stated that he received 3,000 pounds from Kanilov, who promised to pay 30 to 35 pounds per month. The escaped Stephen taught Saiman's friend Dukat how to operate a handgun. Stephen also taught them how to throw bombs. Saiman was taught shooting by Pavloff. Saiman and Dukat, observing the preparations, suspected that they might be planning to assassinate Von Papen. Subsequently, Sagor was questioned. He was born in Yugoslavia in 1916. He stated that he received letters from Avdivis and Rifki requesting assistance for Nizeki. Upon arriving in Istanbul, Nizeki stated that he was going to Moscow and asked Sagor to send his luggage to Moscow. Sagor accepted 27 pounds, paid by Moes. Sagor then received orders to send the luggage to the Soviet Embassy in Turkey. Later, he went to the Soviet Embassy with a Polish engineer and visited Kanilov. Kanilov intended to maintain contact with Yugoslavia, so Sagor introduced Saiman to Kanilov to maintain contact. Dukat arrived in Ankara on January 15th and stayed at Sagor's house for 15 days. Dukat declared that if there was a Soviet-Turkish alliance, they could occupy Germany within a year, and the war could end sooner. Dukat received orders from Kanilov to assassinate the German Ambassador to Turkey, Von Papen. The judge asked why he did not report it to the police, to which Sagor could not answer. He admitted to attending Communist Party meetings several times, but stated he was not a Communist Party member.

### German Planes Bomb Malta

London, 1st (Reuters) Due to the improvement in the weather, the German Air Force launched a major bombing raid on Malta again on Wednesday.

### French Cabinet Rumored to Be Reorganized

Geneva, 2nd (Havas News Agency) The Havas World News Agency's diplomatic correspondent issued a special dispatch today stating that when French Head of State Pétain met with former Prime Minister Laval last Thursday, the issue discussed was likely the relationship between France and Germany. Afterwards, Laval stayed in Paris for a short time and met with German Ambassador to the occupied zone of France, Abetz, several times. However, according to reliable sources, these talks were purely private. After Laval returned to the Chateau de Chartreton near Vichy this Tuesday, he did not meet with Head of State Pétain or Cabinet Associate Darlan. Contact may have been made through a third party. As for Germany, it is paying attention to the trend of opinion in French political circles, but its attitude towards France largely depends on the success or failure of the spring offensive on the Eastern Front. As for the situation of the French cabinet, since the death of Army Minister General Huntziger, the position of Army Minister has been vacant until now. The door to cabinet reorganization has been opened frequently, and the time for reorganization may be approaching.

Berlin, 2nd (Havas News Agency) The German Foreign Ministry refused to disclose Laval's future role in French politics after discussing with French Head of State General Pétain and other government officials.

### Continued Trial of the Riom Court; Two Witnesses in the Misgovernment Case

Riom, France, 1st (Havas News Agency) The Riom Supreme Court summoned two witnesses this month in the misgovernment case. General Langlelois, who served as chief of staff under the late Army Minister General Huntziger, stated that in May 1940, he served as commander of the 3rd Division. The division was inadequately equipped, so it was difficult to resist the German army's fierce attacks on the first encounter. However, their morale and calm attitude in the face of difficulty were commendable. In short, the French government officials at the time lacked a realistic understanding. They never really believed in the war, and the false news published by various newspapers poisoned public opinion to the extreme. General Steller, who served as aide-de-camp to Prime Minister Daladier for two years, continued to speak, saying that the claim that the army was controlled by politics was not true. As for armaments, they were expected to be sufficient for resistance. For example, as of May 1, 1940, we had a total of 2,300 modern tanks, which increased to 2,700 by the end of the month. It can be seen that the total tonnage of our tanks at that time was at least comparable to Germany's. The president of the court inquired about the procurement of armaments. General Steller replied that the allocation of armaments when ordering them was indeed decided by Jaccomet, the supply officer of the General Staff, but his position was not Minister of Armaments. However, Jaccomet could also have a say when there was unused funds.

### Norwegian Ships Anchored in Sweden Sail to England; Intercepted by German Warships En Route; Two Ships Sunk, Totaling 16,000 Tons

### Two Brazilian Ships Sail to Shanghai, Preparing to Evacuate American Nationals. Negotiations on Evacuation of British, Dutch, and Belgian Nationals Still Pending. Danish Consulate Investigates Businesses and Registers Nationals

The evacuation of Allied nationals from this port. Since the Swiss Consul General revealed news of ongoing negotiations between the American and Japanese governments regarding an exchange of officials, followed by the Japanese Consulate General's announcement of registration for the evacuation of Allied nationals (excluding British, American, Dutch, and Belgian citizens). The matter of evacuation seems to be gradually materializing.

Active Evacuation of American Nationals

Regarding this matter, the Swiss Consulate is acting on behalf of all British, American, and Dutch nationals in this port, while the Swedish Consulate is acting on behalf of Belgian nationals, in negotiations with the Japanese side, with the principle of mutual exchange of nationals. Concerning American and Chinese nationals, the Swiss Consulate has already submitted an evacuation plan for discussions between Tokyo and Washington, in order to establish an agreement on the exchange of nationals. At the same time, the Swiss Consulate General has received instructions from its American Interests Section to register American officials in Shanghai. Other ordinary American nationals who intend to leave Shanghai and return to their country using this evacuation plan can apply for evacuation to the American Nationals Association. The Association had previously announced the commencement of registration.

Association Sets Deadline for Registration

Recently, they urged American nationals who wish to evacuate to report to the designated location for registration as soon as possible. The Association also issued a notice yesterday, setting a deadline for completing registration procedures. The notice stated: "In order to obtain complete information in the shortest possible time, this Association hereby notifies American nationals intending to leave Shanghai that they must complete registration procedures on or before the 9th of this month. The Evacuation Registration Office is located at Room 603, No. 113 Jiujiang Road. Registration hours are from 9:30 AM to 12:30 PM and from 2:00 PM to 3:30 PM daily. The office will be closed on the 3rd (Friday) and 5th (Easter) of this month. Shanghai American Nationals Association." This proves that the evacuation of American nationals is proceeding very actively.

Evacuation Issues for British, Dutch, and Belgian Nationals

It is reported that there are over 1,000 American nationals in this port, with approximately 120 or more classified as officials, all of whom will be evacuated. The number of ordinary nationals who wish to evacuate is yet to be announced after registration is complete. It is understood that two Brazilian ships have already set sail from South America, preparing to transport nationals exchanged for evacuation between the United States and Japan. As for the evacuation of British, Dutch, and Belgian officials and nationals in this port, no plan has been drafted, nor has registration begun. Only several discussions have been held by the parties concerned. However, due to the fact that the home countries of Britain, the Netherlands, and Belgium are located in Europe, which makes shipping inconvenient, and that the Netherlands and Belgium have already been occupied, their evacuation issues are more complicated. It is said that British, Dutch, and Belgian nationals will also be evacuated to the United States or Canada. The truth of this remains to be verified.

Danish Consulate Investigates Businesses

Furthermore, the Danish Consul General in this port, Mr. Hill, issued a notice yesterday, announcing the investigation of Danish businesses and the registration of nationals. The following is a translation of the two notices: (A) "All Danish owners of Danish businesses, warehouses, factories, properties, and houses within the Shanghai (referring to the Public Settlement, French Concession, and western Shanghai) area are requested to immediately come to this Consulate General in person to report all details for the inquiries of the Japanese authorities in this port."

Registering Nationals Simultaneously

(B) "For the convenience of the Japanese authorities in this port, this Consul General hereby requests Danish nationals in Shanghai (referring to the two concessions and western Shanghai) to report the following items to the Danish Consulate General immediately: 1. Name; 2. Address; 3. Gender; 4. Occupation (type of occupation and name and address of workplace); 5. Age; 6. Date of obtaining Danish nationality (date of birth, marriage, or naturalization). The above locations and addresses must be stated in detail. This form must be filled out separately by each person, typed in triplicate, and submitted directly to Mr. Aspe at Room 200, No. 51 Guangdong Road. The office hours are from 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM every morning. If it is not possible to type, that office can provide all assistance."

### British Merchant Ships Converted to Transport After Leaving Hong Kong. A Total of Twelve Vessels Were Confiscated. Ships That Left Hong Kong are Now in India and Australia.

Since December 8th of last year, the shipping situation has changed drastically. Jardine Matheson and Swire, two companies with more than a century of history in China, held authority in the shipping industry. Branch offices were established in all ports in the north and south and along the Yangtze River, with business surpassing the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. Jardine Matheson had thirteen river steamers and more than twenty ocean-going vessels. Swire had more than fifty ocean-going vessels and twenty river steamers.

A Time of Unparalleled Dominance in Shipping

After the outbreak of the Shanghai War, river steamers ceased operations, and shipping in the north and south flourished. Profits were even greater than before the incident. At that time, due to the suspension of Chinese shipping, the two companies dominated shipping in the north and south. Shipping costs and ticket prices increased repeatedly. After the outbreak of the Pacific War, vessels of both companies rushed to Hong Kong, Singapore, and various locations in Southeast Asia. Six Swire vessels moored at Hankou, Wenzhou, Wuhu, Wusong, Changsha, Shashi, and Xiangtan, and three Jardine Matheson vessels, Baohua, Longhua, and Jihua, were confiscated, totaling nine vessels. Baohua and Longhua have been assigned to sail the lower reaches of the Yangtze River. Three Swire ocean-going vessels, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and New Beijing, were captured at sea and escorted to Shanghai. They are currently moored on the Huangpu River.

Eight Vessels Were Scuttled in Hong Kong

Swire vessels in Hong Kong that failed to leave in time included Chengdu, Ganzhou, Nanning, and Suzhou, four vessels. Jardine Matheson had Rising Sun, Fusheng, Guisheng, and Mingsheng (one of the New Sihai vessels), four vessels. A total of eight vessels were ordered to be scuttled. The crew members all landed safely. The remaining vessels sailed south completely and are now in various ports in India and Australia. Swire is said to have twenty-six vessels in India and Australia, and the number for Jardine Matheson is unknown. However, all have been placed under the control of the British Admiralty and converted into transport ships, exclusively for military use.

### Post-Settlement Arrangements for Elderly, Weak, Disabled, and Destitute Refugees. Food Provided by the Shanghai Municipal Council.

After the repatriation of refugees from this port, only the remaining elderly, weak, orphans, disabled, and destitute individuals remained. Because they are truly unable to be repatriated, arrangements are still needed. Our newspaper reporters have once again investigated the situation and recorded the following:

Post-Settlement Arrangements Agreed

The refugees housed by the Tzu Lien Branch at the Jessfield Road and Tianhou Palace locations are mostly elderly, weak, and disabled. Apart from those who could be repatriated, who have already been sent out, there are still more than 300 people who cannot survive without assistance. Therefore, after the association consulted with the Shanghai Municipal Council and other charitable organizations, a meeting was held at the Pudong Fellow Provincials Association a few days ago. After collective discussions, it was decided that the Shanghai Municipal Council would take over, maintain the provision of food, and concentrate the elderly and disabled refugees at the Tze Yuan Refugee Shelter on North Zhejiang Road.

Centralized Shelter

The day before yesterday, Western staff members, together with representatives from the Tzu Lien General Association, transferred a portion of the elderly and weak refugees, totaling 115 people, to the Tze Yuan Refugee Shelter on North Zhejiang Road for resettlement. More than 200 people will also be gradually concentrated and sent to the shelter within days. The provision of food will continue to be provided by the Shanghai Municipal Council, and the Tzu Lien General Association will assist in the management.

A temporary subletting license issuance office was specially opened opposite the bicycle license window in the Rates Office to alleviate the congestion.

Issuance Hours

The Shanghai Municipal Council's Rates Office's license issuance hours are set from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM and from 1:00 PM to 4:00 PM.

### Dismissed Apprentice Conspires with Thugs to Intimidate Shop Owner. Liu Fuchang Receives Threatening Letters. Three Suspects Have Been Arrested One After Another.

Liu Fuchang, the owner of Mingchang Bookstore at No. 741 Avenue Joffre, received several threatening letters last month, stating that he was required to lend 2,000 yuan, otherwise drastic measures would be taken, etc. The letters were signed "Shanghai Concession Troops". Liu dismissed the letters with a smile. Unexpectedly, he received another letter the day before yesterday, and two thugs, Zhang Mugang and Fang Zhongcheng, went to Mingchang Bookstore, saying they wanted to meet with the shop owner, Liu Fuchang, to talk. Seeing that the situation was not good, Liu immediately telephoned the French Police Department, which immediately dispatched detectives to the bookstore and arrested Zhang and Fang, and confiscated a pistol and five bullets from their persons, and took them to the police station. Zhang and Fang confessed that they were truly poor and helpless and had conspired with Tang Yizhou, a dismissed apprentice from the store, to borrow 1,000 yuan from the owner of Mingchang Bookstore to start a small business, and they dared not act illegally, and asked for leniency. Subsequently, yesterday afternoon, detectives went to Room 229, Dalu Apartment, and arrested Tang Yizhou and took him to the police station, ordering him to be detained, pending a joint investigation and prosecution.

### Sneaking into the Racecourse to Steal a Bicycle

The Englishman, Cyril Spencer Archard, 28 years old, residing at No. 12, Lane 833, Avenue Joffre, previously served as a Western Constable in the Public Police Department, but was ordered to be dismissed for improper conduct. At 8:40 AM on the 1st of this month, the Englishman sneaked into the Mahok Road Racecourse. At that time, Huang Qinglian, a Chinese compradore from the Fair Road Huashun Wharf, was practicing horseback riding and had deposited his bicycle in the open space of the racecourse. The Englishman took the opportunity to steal it and attempted to escape, but was spotted by a groom, Ma Gongfu, who arrested him and reported it to the Chengdu Road Police Station, who ordered detectives to take him to the police station for detention. He was sent to court on the morning of the 2nd, requesting permission to detain him for further investigation.

### A Group of Three: Gang Robbery of Overshoes, Impoverished and Desperate to Take the Risk

Shi Ronghua, a local resident of Shanghai, forty-two years old, residing at No. 2 Yongquan Village, Henry Road, French Concession, purchased sixty-two pairs of rubber overshoes from a certain place on the afternoon of the 28th of last month at 5 o'clock, valued at over eight hundred yuan. He was carrying them with him when he passed by the Nanyang Hospital on Route Sapey, French Concession, when suddenly, thirty or so people rushed forward and snatched all the overshoes and fled. At that time, Shi, in a moment of desperation, shouted for robbers. Patrol officers heard the sound and arrived, apprehending eight people, including Wang Chunmao, Wang Ruxi, Shi Jiaming, Chen Manhong, Zhuang Mingdong, Zhang Ayu, and Jiang Ahai, and intercepting over thirty pairs of the stolen goods. The remaining accomplices and the remaining stolen goods had scattered and escaped, making it impossible to pursue and recover them. The apprehended criminals were immediately taken to the police station. According to Wang and others' confession, they were driven to break the law due to poverty and desperation. The police chief ordered them to be detained pending further investigation.

### Jews and Hot Money

— Gan

Since the expulsion of Jews from the European continent, Shanghai has become a haven for them. Those with assets brought their capital early to this oriental paradise, and even those without a penny to their name were successively sent to the city on refugee ships. Now, walking from the French Concession to Hongkou, you can encounter Jews everywhere. These Jews are indeed very capable; they can not only survive in Shanghai, but also influence the city's market.

Originally, the name "Jew" seemed to be synonymous with "money-grubber." They have no country, they do not recognize ethnicity, and their sole pursuit is profit, is hard currency. The Jews' ability to pursue profit is unparalleled in the world. First, the method of arranging and allocating capital is extremely clever. They practiced in the European market and brought a copy of their skills to Shanghai, of course, to use them with ease and mastery. They certainly have no concept of country or ethnicity, but they are most adept at banding together for the sake of profit. For example, if one person hoards a certain commodity, the impact is ultimately small. But Jews will band together to hoard goods and use various methods to influence the market. As a result, a certain commodity indeed soared in price day and night, rising to the point where it could no longer rise, and then they emerged, dumping the rotten goods on others. The Jews have made a fortune. This refers to the Jews who came to Shanghai with capital to trade stocks and speculate. As for the penniless Jews, they also brought a set of skills with them. Some can repair clocks and watches, some can prepare prescriptions, some can draw and play music, some can paint and decorate, and some can make cosmetics, and cook Western food. Thus, they start by carrying a tattered leather bag, wandering around selling small sundries, rising step by step, eventually acquiring half a storefront, gradually expanding and occupying a large storefront, and further hiring Chinese staff. They themselves have also learned a set of necessary Shanghai dialect. These ordinary propertyless Jews have also established themselves in Shanghai. The Jews truly deserve to be called Jews. Chinese merchants, no matter how skilled, are no match for the Jews.

The businesses operated by Jews in Shanghai are already enough to affect the market and make consumers suffer. Even more ferocious, more difficult to deal with, and more indifferent to the lives and deaths of consumers than the Jews is the large sum of hot money squeezed into Shanghai.

Before the outbreak of the Pacific War, the hot money squeezed into Shanghai was used for foreign exchange, stocks, hoarding, real estate, and the like. After the outbreak of the war, it was used for military scrip and hoarding. Because there was too much hot money, even the authorities tried everything to control it but could not. Daily necessities followed the rise of foreign exchange and military scrip and rose like lightning. A sheet of carbon paper that originally cost a few cents would rise to a few dollars a sheet, something that even insiders could not dream of. The reason is that the hot money squeezed in, drilled into every hole, and was all-pervasive. The rise and fall of commodity prices were completely without any standard. Bai Que Ji-style ointment, which was originally something that could be dispensed with, became popular because of the extensive advertising and the old brand name. Everyone wanted to hoard it. This seemingly useful but actually useless ointment rose from a few cents a box to three, five, ten, or even twenty times... and everyone was still expecting it to rise. Similarly, heat rash medicine and mosquito coils, etc., were being snapped up in large quantities even before they were in season.

Those who hoard and speculate, buy forward contracts, and hoard banknotes, etc., do not care at all about the soaring prices of daily necessities. Because they have made a windfall, they think that even if the price of rice rises to six hundred yuan per dan, it will be at the expense of others. The more expensive things are, the more they don't care. As for ordinary law-abiding people who live honestly, they suffer greatly, from having a little savings to becoming debt-ridden, from being middle-class to becoming penniless, from being propertyless to becoming beggars, and from beggars to becoming corpses on the street. Those who own hot money and make a fortune do not care about the dead. They still drill into every hole they can find, wanting to make even more money after making a fortune!

Under the dual pressure of Jews and hot money, the poor people naturally have only one way to go: to sit and wait for death.

Shen Weisheng, a local resident of Shanghai, thirty-three years old, residing at No. 6 Xinyang Village, Gansdong Road, Lafayette Road, is the manager of Jinshan Trading Company and Hefeng Trading Company, and the business director of Shanghai Livestock Plantation Company. He is fond of pleasure-seeking, leading to a mountain of debt.

After obtaining the money, he spent it lavishly, purchasing cars and diamond rings, etc., living a life of luxury. When the check matured, it could not be cashed due to insufficient funds. Xie negotiated with Shen, but Shen avoided meeting him. The Jinshan Company he opened had also closed down long ago. Xie realized he had been deceived and reported the situation to the authorities, requesting an arrest warrant. Xie learned that Shen was hosting a banquet at the Dahua Restaurant on Huage Nie Road. Xie accompanied detectives from the French Concession Police Station to arrest him and released him on 20,000 yuan bail pending investigation.

### A General Overview of Jesuit Translations and Writings Over the Past Hundred Years

— Xu Zongze

This year marks the hundredth anniversary of the return of Jesuit priests to China. In these hundred years, the books translated and written by the priests have been quite considerable. Now, I will give a general overview.

Since St. Ignatius founded the Society of Jesus in 1540, the Jesuits soon spread throughout the world. At the end of the Ming Dynasty, Matteo Ricci also came to our country to preach in 1583. In 1773, Pope Clement XIV, under pressure from those who hated the holy church, ordered the abolition of the Society of Jesus. The Jesuits in China were also dissolved on November 15, 1775, by order of Rome.

However, things reach their extreme and then turn around, which is the norm. Pope Pius VII issued a decree in 1814, restoring the Society of Jesus. The Jesuits in various European countries were thus restored. Our Chinese priests and Catholics learned of this news and also wrote to Pope Gregory XVI of Rome and Father General Laudani of the Society of Jesus, requesting them to send priests to return to China. The Pope and the Father General agreed and sent three French priests, Gotteland, Esteve, and Brueyre, who set off for China on April 20, 1841, and arrived in Shanghai on July 11 of the following year.

The Origin of the Name Xujiahui

After the three priests arrived in Shanghai, they revived the missionary work. In 1847, they purchased land in Xujiahui to build a church and residence, and Xujiahui became the center of Jesuit missionary work from then on. Xujiahui is the location of the tomb of the Ming Dynasty Prime Minister Xu Wending. His descendants lived there for generations. It is also the confluence of the Zhaojia Creek and the Fahua Creek, hence the name Xujiahui. After the priests chose Xujiahui as their central location, various cultural undertakings were also established there one after another. The Xujiahui Library began operating in 1847, collecting books. Xuhui Middle School, originally named St. Ignatius College, was founded in 1850. The Tushanwan Orphanage was established in 1864. In 1873, the observatory was established. In 1879, the Yiwun Daily was published, and in 1887, the Sacred Heart News was published. All cultural work was gradually developed. Now, let's just talk about the translations and writings.

Over the past hundred years, most of those in the Society of Jesus who held pens and wrote books were priests of Chinese nationality, and Western priests had no Chinese writings. Among the writers of Chinese nationality, most were from Jiangsu, followed by Xian County in Hebei, then Anhui and Guangdong, because the New Society of Jesus was concentrated in Jiangsu Province. Most of the books they compiled and wrote were religious, including the Bible, apologetics, theology, philosophy, morality, worship, catechism, church history, science, and other books. In terms of quantity, there are hundreds of kinds, more than the publications of the Old Society of Jesus. In terms of quality, it seems no less than the Old Society of Jesus, but its influence has not been able to catch up with its predecessors, which is due to the trend of the times. The New Society of Jesus arrived in Shanghai in 1842 and this year, 1942, within a century, the books compiled and written can be divided into three periods.

Compiled and Written Books Divided into Three Periods

The first period is from 1842 to 1879, which can be called the founding period. During this period, the first booklet published was the "General Questions and Answers of the Holy Church," signed by Nanyue Delang, a Jesuit from the West, translated and compiled, and Zhuang Xingjian from Chuansha participated in the revision. The second book was "Explanation of the Jubilee," written by Zhao Deli Zottli, a Jesuit from the Far West. Chao was an Italian. At that time, he was the principal of St. Ignatius College in Xujiahui and later the spiritual director of the Jesuit novices. Not only did he have a large number of students, but many of them were disciples who were good at literature, such as Ma Liang, Xiang Bo, and Li Linwen Yu. Only more than a dozen kinds of books were published during this period.

The second period is from 1879, the year the Yiwun Daily was founded, to 1911, the day the Huibao was discontinued. This period can be called the prosperous period. Not only was the publication prosperous during this period, but the cultural undertaking was formally organized, and the Varietes Sinologiques, the Chinese Studies Research Society, was founded. Those in charge were Xia Minglei Havret, and those who assisted were Chinese priests Li Lin (Wen Yu), Shen Zekuan, Pei Zhai, Jiang Sheng, Xu Huan, Xu Youxi, and Zhang Yushan. Father Huang Bolu of Haimen was also a famous sinologist, known in Europe and the United States. Sixty-six kinds of Chinese Studies Series have been published to date.

In addition to the Chinese Studies Series, Xu Huan also organized a cultural institution, namely, the publication of Yiwun Daily. It was initially scheduled to be published twice a month. The first issue was published on March 16, 1879. From the eleventh issue onwards, the newspaper was published once every seven days. At that time, in addition to the Shanghai Shenbao, there were few newspapers, such as the Nongxing. Once the Yiwun Daily was published, it spread like wildfire and became popular throughout the country. In 1887, the Sacred Heart News was also published once a month. These two newspapers were founded by Father Li Wenyu (Lin). The Yiwun Daily was later renamed Huibao, and was published twice every seven days. It was discontinued in 1911 and reorganized into the Sacred Church Magazine. The Sacred Heart News has been published to this day without interruption.

Among the publications in this second period, about 100 kinds of books were published in the first 20 years, most of which were sacred books. After the Wuxu Coup, the Qing court advocated Western learning, so the priests compiled and translated Kobe, and published many books, which were quite popular with the society. Father Li Wenyu alone wrote more than 60 kinds of books in 33 years. Father Li was indeed a representative figure in this period. He was from Nanhui, Jiangsu, born in 1840 and died in 1911. After Father Li's death, the publications of Xuhui entered a new period.

The third period is from the year the Sacred Church Magazine was founded to the present. The first issue of the magazine was published in January 1912, once a month. The founders and editors were Father Pan Qiulu, a priest from Qingpu, Jiangsu, born in 1867 and died in 1921. The deputy editor was Father Zhang Yushan, a priest from Nanhui, Jiangsu, born in 1872 and died in 1929. He was also a famous sinologist and wrote many books. The content of the Sacred Church Magazine is mostly about defending the truth and researching scholarship, and it pays special attention to modern thought. Therefore, once it was published, it was not only popular among religious readers, but also among scholars outside the church, and many overseas Chinese in Europe and the United States subscribed to it. In September 1938, it was temporarily suspended due to environmental reasons.

In the early stage of this third period, the publications included the compilation of textbooks, from elementary school to middle school, there were textbooks in classical Chinese and vernacular Chinese, which were published by the Tushanwan Printing House. After the National Government established its capital in Nanjing in 1927, the ideological trend changed greatly again. The general public paid attention to democracy and civil rights, and socialism and communism were widely promoted. At this time, the publications of the priests included books on civics, the Three People's Principles, sociology, economics, and so on. At the same time, many books on theology and philosophy were also published. There were also various small series of books published, which were quite in line with the trend of the times.

In August 1927, Xu Huan organized a translation and compilation office, namely, Guangqi Society. Shanghai Xu Guangqi used culture to promote the public church, so the society took his name to commemorate him. The purpose of Guangqi Society is to translate and compile books on religion and scholarship to communicate Chinese and Western culture. The scope is even wider than the Institute of Chinese Studies, and many books have been published. In addition, the Jesuits who preach in our country are scattered in various provinces, of different nationalities, and belong to different provincial capitals. Recently, in order to connect the Chinese publishing undertakings of the Jesuits across the country, a liaison office for Chinese publications of the Jesuits across the country was established in Xuhui in 1940, so that they can report to each other and communicate information.

Remarkable Achievements in a Hundred Years

As for the content of various books, they all have something to say, and they are beneficial to morality and learning. As for the writing style, some are profound and gorgeous, and some are simple and clear. In short, there are differences in style and custom due to the different classes of readers. Moreover, the writings of the New Jesuits are not like those of the Old Jesuits, who rely on the embellishment of Han Cao or the preface and postscript of celebrities. Because of this, the works of the New Priests are not praised by high officials and writers, and they are rarely spread among foreigners. Believers recite them daily as a method of self-cultivation. But there is a subtle and indelible truth in them, which, once revealed, will be appreciated by each other. For example, Mr. Zhou Zuoren said about Imitation of Christ: "This Imitation of Christ is a book that I like, although I am not a Catholic. I heard that this is a representative work of medieval Christian thought, but it does not have the strictness of a moralist, and its purpose is close to mysticism, which makes us feel very interesting. From the point of view of writing, it is also a very valuable book." Zhou Zuoren wrote his own garden, page 200.

In this century, the books published or reprinted by the Jesuits, in terms of both quality and quantity, there are many important books such as "A New Compilation of History and Straightforward Lectures," "The Complete New Testament," "A New Translation of the New Testament," "The Essence of the Source of Truth," "The Complete Book of Meditation," "The Correct Standard of Cultivation," "Introduction to Cultivation," "Outline of Theology," "Outline of Philosophy," "Essentials of Supernaturalism," "Exploration of Names and Principles," "Xu's Kitchen Words," and so on.

Based on this, the publications of the New Jesuits in this century are already remarkable, and there are still many Western books, Chinese-French dictionaries, dictionaries, maps, and novels that have not been mentioned one by one. Now, according to the book list of the Tushanwan Printing House (1941), there are 971 kinds of books, and the book list of the Tianjin Chongde Hall (1940) has 816 kinds. Publications from Anqing, Wuhu, Bengbu, Chongqing, Xuzhou, and Macau have not yet been included. However, among the 1,787 kinds of books mentioned above, single sheets, pamphlets, and reprints of the works of the Old Jesuits are also counted in them.

The above is just a general overview, as a memorial. In the future, cultural undertakings will surely be even more remarkable.

### Pleading for Refugee Children

Ding Fubao's letter pleading for the refugee children of the Shanghai Fuyou Orphanage says: "Since the opening of the Shanghai Fuyou Orphanage, more than 90 refugee children have been sent by various charitable organizations. Most of the refugee children are thin and weak, and their faces are sallow. Many suffer from internal medicine, surgery, and skin diseases. In addition, they are poorly clothed and hungry. They are truly the most pitiful people in the world. However, the nature of the refugee children is the same as ours. All human beings are equal and there is no difference. It is only that their circumstances are slightly unfortunate. If the powerful people today treat the refugee children with equality, first provide them with clothing and food to relieve their hunger and cold, then treat their diseases with medicine, use hygiene methods to make them healthy, and use education methods to enlighten their talents in filial piety, fraternity, loyalty, trustworthiness, propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame, as well as various sciences. After ten or twenty years, who knows if various talents will emerge from these refugee children? We are old and like the setting sun, with little remaining light, while the refugee children are like the rising sun, and soon will be in the middle of the day. They are truly the most promising people in the world. However, without the powerful, they cannot be saved. Today, April 4th, is Children's Day. Fubao sincerely asks the powerful to help the refugee children of the Shanghai Fuyou Orphanage and to seek ways to expand and improve the orphanage. That would be fortunate. The office is located at No. 204 Meibaige Road, telephone number 31837, and the orphanage is located at No. 101 Gongyi Wharf Street, Zhaojia Du, Nanshi."

### Newborn Production for Orphans

A letter from Guan Jiong-zhi, Director of the Jingye Orphanage, states that the orphanage's crafts workshop has long been producing clothing, Western suits, rattan and bamboo crafts, wood and paint products, sofa repairs, rabbit breeding, and net weaving, with inexpensive and high-quality products. As Children's Day approaches, the orphanage, in order to expand its services to the community, has newly established a leather shoe workshop in addition to the existing workshops. The products are of high quality and the prices are especially low. At a time when prices are soaring, this move by the orphanage provides great convenience to general consumers. The orphanage is located inside Jueyuan at No. 400, the intersection of Avenue Edward VII and Hardoon Road, telephone number 33781.

### Retail Investors Scavenge, Raw Gold Rises Sharply

Yesterday's cash raw gold in the black market saw prices trending upward amid sparse transactions. Scattered retail investors were quite active in buying. There was an increasing number of customers in the gold jewelry shops (not subject to registration controls). These customers came to scavenge, causing the price to rise from 18,200 yuan in the morning to 18,600 yuan. It then retreated slightly to 18,450 yuan, due to a small sell-off by a certain securities firm. At 11:00 AM, it was 18,500 yuan, and at noon it rose again to 18,600-18,700 yuan. It is said that military tickets were also trending upward, up 400 yuan from the previous day's noon price. Starting today, the Tomb Sweeping Festival and Sunday together make a four-day holiday, and business will resume on the 7th (next Tuesday).

The price of gold jewelry per tael at Da Xin and other major gold shops remained at 1,950 yuan (200 yuan less for purchases). Standard silver was listed at 18 yuan. The black market had prices with no volume, around 14 yuan. Silver coins were about 8 yuan each.

### Discount Rate Reduced by Five Yuan

Yesterday, the discount rate for "header" bills was reduced by five yuan per thousand, to fifteen yuan. The interbank lending rate of the Money Trade Association remained unchanged at 7%.

### Military Tickets Increased Again Yesterday

Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw the British and American gold pounds remain stable, with the former still at 400 yuan and the latter still at 410 yuan. US dollar tickets were still 27-28 yuan, and Hong Kong tickets were also still 3.5 yuan, with large notes discounted by 10 cents. Military tickets rose as high as 7.75 yuan, and the final price was 7.7 yuan.

### Before Tomb Sweeping Holiday, Internal Debt Fully Settled

The over-the-counter market for government bonds fell again yesterday, but sentiment was not weak. Because there is a holiday starting today, for a total of four days including Sunday, most speculators are unwilling to bear the unearned interest during this extended holiday and are eager to sell. However, there were also quite a few who were willing to buy, mainly due to tight credit. As a result, prices fell, and after the price fell, short sellers took advantage of the low prices to cover their positions. Initially, Tongli and Lianhe bought in, followed by Yongkang, Chengkang, Hu Heji, and Dadehao absorbing them. Class C bonds rose to 4.8 yuan. Later, Hongxinghao suddenly sold a large quantity, and Tongkanghao took the opportunity to cover their short positions. Lianxinghao absorbed Class B bonds in large volumes. Others such as Tongji, Shunli, Datong, Runde, Zhenhua (selling Class E), and Yuxing (selling Class A and B) also sold some. In short, the total transaction volume for the day was over 800,000 yuan, with most being short-covering transactions. Most new transactions were short selling, with a few being investments. Most people are holding the principle of trading again after the market reopens. As a result, prices fell by 4 to 9 cents across the board. The transaction volume was approximately 800,000 yuan. A brief summary table is listed below.

Starting today, there is a four-day holiday for Tomb Sweeping Festival including the weekend. Business will resume as usual on the 7th.

### Both Chinese and Western Stocks Had Sparse Trading

Yesterday, foreign stocks were firm, but trading turned sparse, with a total of 5,400 shares traded. Jardine Spinning Mill had 500 shares, with the price rising to 26.5 yuan. Xinyi had 2,000 shares, at 7.65 yuan and 7.7 yuan. Zhongfang had 500 shares, at 11.1 yuan. Lei Che had 1,400 shares, with the price rising from 43 yuan to 43.5 yuan, and finally 43.25 yuan. Ken Zhi had 1,000 shares, with the price at 26.75 and 27 yuan. The rest were also slightly firm, but no opening transactions were made.

Yesterday, Chinese stocks were flat and weak, and trading was also light. Wing On Company was at 44 yuan, and Sincere at 76 yuan, both down one yuan. China Underwear was 19.75 to 19.5 yuan.

### Dragon Head Fine Cloth Soars by Ten Yuan

Factory Cloth: Yesterday's market saw very little trading and little price movement. Sixteen-pound Flying Swan coarse cloth factory orders opened at 182 yuan, spot goods at 180 yuan. Caihua Butterfly factory orders were at 120 yuan. Fourteen-pound One Deer orders were at 100 yuan. Twelve-pound Dapeng fine cloth spot goods were at 175 yuan, factory orders at 135 yuan. Blue Magnolia bleached cloth was at 178 yuan. Chick Shirting was at 270 yuan. Changshou Fu silk was at 6.15 yuan. White Cat printed cloth was at 135 yuan. These were all morning prices. The market became even quieter in the afternoon due to the market closure starting today.

Eastern Cloth: Prices continued to rise sharply, reaching new highs. Dragon Head fine cloth new orders opened in the morning at 228 yuan, fell to 226.5 yuan, and then rose again to 235 yuan at noon. Although there was not much trading in the afternoon, the market atmosphere remained firm, reaching a high of 238 yuan. The closing price was 237.5 yuan, up another ten yuan from the previous day. Colorful Ball fine cloth was at 216.5 yuan, Yang He at 214 yuan, Trumpet at 212.5 yuan. Baby fine twill also rose to 185 yuan. Four Gentlemen Serge for the April 10th-12th factory order was at 7.2 yuan, red order with new tax was at 6.93 yuan.

### Spot Yarn Has Stronger Rising Momentum

The cotton yarn market continued to rise, mainly due to the lack of spot goods, so the rising momentum was quite strong. The opening price for 20-count Shuangma factory orders was 3,650 yuan, briefly falling to 3,605 yuan. Hearing that the spot yarn market was good and buyers were coming one after another, the yarn market gradually moved forward, rising to 3,720 yuan. However, some profit-takers sold off, causing it to loosen again. The closing price, however, rose back to 3,700 yuan. 42-count Blue Phoenix was at 8,950 to 9,350 yuan, 42-count Xian Tao at 8,850 yuan, 42-count Yang He at 9,000 yuan, 32-count Blue Phoenix at 9,700 yuan, 60-count Bull Head at 18,500 yuan, 20-count Yue Qin at 4,600 to 4,850 yuan, 20-count Zheng Nian at 5,150 to 5,200 yuan, 20-count Shuang Ma at 4,150 to 4,400 yuan, 16-count Hong Kui Xing at 4,650 to 4,700 yuan, 18-count Zhi Nv at 4,530 yuan, 10-count Boy Scouts at 3,000 to 3,100 yuan, 10-count Red Shuang Ma at 3,100 to 3,200 yuan, 6-count Bumble Bee at 3,950 to 4,250 yuan, and 6-count Rouge Tiger at 4,300 yuan.

### Bean Cake Factory Orders - Some Speculative Trading - Bran Continues to Be Sold Inland

Yesterday's trade in miscellaneous grains remained sluggish, mainly because transportation was still difficult, and people remained hesitant. Only bean cake warehouse orders saw some speculative activity, with prices rising by about one yuan. Other transactions were sparse and prices were mixed. Sales included ten bags of Sangyuan yellow soybeans, priced at 190 yuan; twenty-five bags of Taicang red beans, priced at 206 yuan; one hundred bags of Chongming sand silkworm chrysalis, priced at 146 yuan. 1000 pieces of Hankou bean cake were traded for 41 yuan, 500 pieces of Lizi bean cake new warehouse orders were traded for 55 yuan, and a carload of Feizi bean cake was traded for 54.4 yuan. 3000 pieces of Shenji bean cake new warehouse orders for May delivery were traded at 51 to 52 yuan, for new orders in April, it traded for 51.8 yuan, and for new warehouse orders it traded for 58 yuan.

Recently, inland dealers have been continuously shipping bran, so the off-site selling price has been trending upward. It is said that the inland purchase price for Sanxin bran is 115 yuan.

### Delivery Available - Cigarette Prices Loosen

Cigarette prices continued to weaken. Because Yong Taihe, which previously handled various products from the Yuanchong Factory, continued to distribute goods to peers for sale, the number of wholesalers increased slightly, so prices and sales were sluggish. Sales included 50,000 Great British brand cigarettes at 12,000 yuan per case, Old Knife brand at 10,400 yuan, Little Fairy brand at 6,600 yuan, Five Flowers brand at 6,400 yuan, and Pinhai brand at 7,500 yuan. Japanese cigarettes followed the decline, with Golden Gun brand at 3,360 yuan, Golden Building brand at 3,450 yuan, Red Rose at 2,300 yuan, and Quanlu brand at 3,700 yuan.

### Prices of Daily Necessities Are High - Consumption Is Greatly Reduced

The market for daily necessities is quiet. The selling prices of various goods have reached their peak, and consumption is bound to be reduced. Buyers are temporarily waiting and watching. Sales are sparse, and the market atmosphere is slightly sluggish. Prices include Beautiful brand matches at 7,100 yuan per case, Phoenix spleen at 6,900 yuan, miscellaneous brands at 5,900 yuan, Guban brand soap at 350 yuan per case, Bai Xiangmao soap at 320 yuan, Huang Xiangmao soap at 305 yuan, Scissor soap at 310 yuan, British candle at 200 yuan per case, and Monk Hat brand at 190 yuan.

### Candied Dates Gradually Rise

Recently, candied dates have become scarce, and sugar prices have soared, so market prices have repeatedly risen. Initially, they rose from 650 yuan to 700 yuan, then to 750 yuan. The current market price has already reached 800 yuan. The usual additions and deductions are in place. The new crop season is still far away, so people generally hope to see prices reach 1,000 yuan.

### Pepper Fluctuations Are Significant

Black pepper supplies have been cut off and are also a target for hoarders. This commodity can be stored for a long time without spoiling, so speculative trading is very active. The price for No. 1 pepper once reached a peak of 1,500 yuan, then loosened and fell to 1,200 yuan. It has tightened again in recent days, and yesterday it was 1,350 yuan.

### Polished Rice Shortage

Polished rice has not arrived for a long time, and market stocks are also very low. However, the hoarders still have a small amount of stock. Seeing that the inventory is short, they have high expectations. The price of Guan polished rice has increased by more than 100 yuan, and ordinary goods have also increased by tens of yuan. High-priced goods may reach 500 or 600 yuan in the future.

### Jackfruit (Continued)

— Gao Jiannong

Moreover, its own reproductive capacity is also very astonishing: whether it is a "root sucker" that emerges from the underground root, or a "bud sucker" that emerges from the side of the leaf axil of the aerial stem, or a "small plant" that grows laterally below the fruit, or a "leaf crown" that grows densely above the fruit, all can be cut off from the mother plant for propagation; as for the "seeds" produced by the pulp, they can also germinate, grow, and even bear fruit, but it takes a little longer. Therefore, the places that now produce jackfruit, not to mention the various tropical countries of the Americas; Asia has India, the Indochina Peninsula, and the South Seas Islands; Africa has Guinea and the Congo River Basin; as for the islands in the Pacific Ocean, especially Hawaii, a paradise for tropical plants, and the Azores and Madeira Islands in the Atlantic Ocean, its traces can be seen everywhere; even in the flower rooms of temperate countries, it can also be cultivated.

Jackfruit usually only produces one fruit per plant, but its yield and the size of the fruit vary depending on the type. Moreover, its original appearance was only the size of an orange: its ability to be so large now is entirely the result of people improving its seeds. According to the type: Florida in the southeastern United States mostly cultivates the "Spanish species", which has a fruiting rate of 93%, and 60% to 70% of the fruit diameter can exceed 5 inches. This type of jackfruit has a length slightly shorter than its diameter, forming a flat appearance, turns bright red when ripe, is easy to store, and convenient for long-distance transportation, making it the most valuable commercially. In Central America, Cuba, Guyana, or the Hawaiian Islands, people prefer to cultivate the "Cayenne" species. This type of fruit is of better quality, yellow-green with a slight red tint, with a fruiting rate of 50% to 60%, and 95% of the fruits have a diameter exceeding 5 inches. In the British island of Jamaica and the American island of Puerto Rico in the West Indies, in Brazil, in South Africa, in southern Asia, and in the East Indies, in addition to the two types mentioned above, there is also a "Queen" species: its fruiting rate can be as high as 98%, or even 100%! All the jackfruit mentioned above can be transplanted in all seasons, flower in all seasons, and bear fruit in all seasons: cultivators can predict when it is most cost-effective to bring it to market and harvest it at that time. One more thing to add is that each jackfruit usually weighs 15 pounds, but some can weigh as much as 25 pounds.

After the jackfruit is picked, it must be allowed to "sweat" – evaporate moisture – for 24 hours, and then each one is wrapped in paper, packed in boxes for shipment; each box holds about eight or a little more, with corn husks lining the inside to prevent shaking. If it is for making canned goods, there are specially made machines to peel, core, cut...etc., I think it is unnecessary to describe the step-by-step procedure. As for the two major bases for manufacturing canned goods, they are Hawaii and Singapore, these two naval strongholds facing each other across the sea...! (The End)

Spring and Autumn

### Discussing Profits with the Sub-Landlord

— Weicheng

In the past (and it's only been in the last three to five years), the conflicts and disputes between sub-landlords and sub-tenants could be said to have exhausted all the possibilities. In a nutshell, sub-landlords had a scarce commodity and sub-tenants could not bear the burden. Between these two, there seemed to be a very long distance, always standing in opposition, going in opposite directions. Now, this distance on the surface seems to have not changed, but in reality, there is an invisible force that is pulling both sides closer. If everyone calms down and thinks about it, they will realize that these two are only a difference in units, not a difference in class.

Sub-landlords have a nickname called "house eaters," and we sub-tenants naturally understand. However, in the past, everyone was willing to squeeze into Shanghai, so they were naturally willing to be "eaten." Even if they felt wronged by being "eaten" and came into conflict and dispute, the result was also being forced to lower their heads. Now, most of the sub-tenants are friends holding a "chicken rib," having reached a point where it is tasteless to eat, and will soon be the first candidates in the team to receive free return-to-homeland certificates. No matter how big things are, when they reach their peak, they cannot get any bigger. Therefore, if there are still any conflicts and disputes between sub-landlords and sub-tenants now, it should be the last time. -- If the sub-tenant fails this last time, the sub-landlord will not be the winner either. But it is definitely not a matter of victory or defeat being indistinguishable, the obvious fact is that "the house is empty!" This is the "invisible force." This force can pull together the two sides that are going in opposite directions. Therefore, I want to talk to the sub-landlord about the issue of profits.

The International Settlement has stipulated that the profit of sub-landlords shall not exceed 20%, and even including "external expenses" shall not exceed 35% at most, and based on the contract before March 31 to avoid the "extraneous branches" of new and old legal tender. The day this regulation is implemented will also be the time of peace in the world. The sub-landlords mentioned in this article, of course, refer to those in "Binjiang South."

Taking the sub-landlord where I live as an example, his profit is about 250% to 300%, not counting their own housing. Compared with 35%, the sub-landlords of the International Settlement certainly have a sense of "looking south with their heads raised." But yesterday morning (April 1), the sub-landlord's new order came down, requiring payment in new currency. The reason is that property tax and water and electricity costs must be paid in new currency, so the rent must also be collected in new currency. This reason is the same as when the main landlord increased the rent for water and electricity, called "must earn if there is an increase." Moreover, people have the same intentions, and most of the sub-tenants in the French Concession have received this secret notice to increase the rent by 30%. This kind of new notice will naturally cause some disputes. I don't think this dispute will have the same result as before, right? This different result is also because there is an "invisible force" inside – but it is not pulling closer, but pulling further away. However, victory and defeat are clear.

In recent months, the two authorities have taken the same steps in matters such as security and food supply. The sub-landlords of "Binjiang South" should not think that they are "the only ones who are respected." This "invisible force" is pulling closer in a good way. On the other hand, its power exceeds resistance.

### Marriage Is Difficult

— Shabai

The great French novelist Maupassant said that marriage is like buying a lottery ticket, and it is good if the number can be drawn.

Among tens of thousands of lottery tickets, the number that can be won is too small, so it can be seen that marriage is really not an easy thing. Even if we put aside the theory of marriage and focus on the practical problem - the economic difficulties, under today's standard of living, it is probably enough to cause trouble for a group of young people.

I saw an article in the Western newspaper about marriage expenses exceeding 8,000 yuan (referring to Westerners). In this warm, breezy, lazy weather, it may be called a "timely" article to cobble together a short article with numbers.

The article said that the first step in getting married, the woman must first have an engagement ring, of course, the bigger the diamond ring, the better. Considering the lover's consideration, a small diamond ring costs at least 1,500 yuan, and it cannot be cheaper.

Once the two are engaged, they often have to have tea, watch movies, dance, and go to restaurants. In short, it is another thing that costs money.

The wedding dress worn by the bride on the wedding day now costs at least 500 yuan to make a set. Five years ago, 100 yuan was enough.

The closer the wedding day, the more the groom's head hurts. The gold wedding ring costs at least 250 yuan to 300 yuan. The wedding dress he wears costs 45 yuan to rent once. Five years ago, the rental fee was only 10 yuan, and it cost no more than about 100 yuan to make a new set. Now it is impossible to do without 500 yuan to 1,000 yuan. Borrowing a church for marriage costs another 100 yuan for the pastor's fees. The costs of flowers, singing, and piano players are extra. Even if it is a small family, the first month's rent, paid in advance, is at least 500 yuan. The house cannot be left completely empty. Furniture that is used must be bought. The bride prefers a set of chestnut wood bedroom furniture, which costs 3,000 yuan, a set of dining room utensils costs about 800 yuan, and a set of three-piece sofas costs 2,000 yuan. The total is 5,800 yuan, which disappears again.

Cutlery, spoons, basins, and plates are all thanks to the light of relatives and friends, who provided them in abundance, without costing a penny. However, carpets, curtains, tea sets, tablecloths, hanging lamps, and radios must be paid for out of pocket. There is also the salary of kitchen servants, etc., which must be paid one month in advance.

Okay, adding up all the things before and after, the total has exceeded the 8,000 yuan mark. It's better to be single!

### Catch Bedbug Eggs First

— Xin Lv

Last night, probably because the weather was a little warmer, the hibernating bedbugs moved around, biting me awake from a good dream, and I had a sleepless night. I was extremely angry, and then I decided to get rid of it.

In the early morning, when it was still dimly lit, I put on my clothes and got out of bed, boiled a pot of boiling water, took the bed board apart, took it to the drying platform, poured it around, and found many white transparent oval bedbug eggs in the cracks in the board.

I thought that if all these eggs hatched, they would breed and spread, and it would be difficult to get rid of them. Fortunately, I found out early.

I remember someone once asked Mr. Wu Zhihui what the secret was to get rid of bedbugs. The gentleman did not answer directly, but gave that person a letter and ordered him to open it after returning home. It turned out that there were only two large characters "Catch diligently" on the entire stationery, without any secret recipe.

Catching diligently is indeed the only effective method to get rid of bedbugs, but it is not easy to completely eliminate them. It is better to put them to death before they are born. It is easy and effortless, and it can also eliminate them all at once, so that you will not be harassed by them on hot summer nights again.

Bedbug, also known as lazy bug. The meaning of this name is for everyone to experience for themselves.

### "It's Better to Give Birth to a Pig Than a Child"

— A Rooster

In a chance encounter, I saw a middle-aged man sitting by the sidewalk with a child. The child's old-fashioned felt hat had a straw marker stuck in it. The "straw marker" signified that it was for sale. What was being sold was certainly not that old-fashioned felt hat, but the child wearing the felt hat. I did not want to buy a child, and I dared not ask how much the child was being sold for, because I couldn't bear to ask the price of a "human," the "spirit of all things," as if he were livestock. I stood silently to the side, hoping that a "superhuman" who could endure what others could not would come forward to ask the price, or even buy the child. I could listen from the sidelines and learn the "market price" of a "human," the "spirit of all things."

A young couple, arm in arm, walked past with hurried steps, their eyes and mouths constantly engaged in conversation. They paid no attention whatsoever to the "spirit of all things" being sold by the roadside. A middle-aged gentleman, balding and dressed in Western attire, walked by, a Luzon cigar in his mouth and a cane in his hand. He glanced at the head with the "straw marker" with a disdainful look and casually flicked the cigar butt to the side of the road; this kind of waste, like the cigar butt, was just waste. A kind-faced, vegetarian old lady, holding Buddhist prayer beads, perhaps reciting a section of the Diamond Sutra, looked at the "straw marker" with surprise and quickly quickened her pace, chanting scriptures as she walked by; this was retribution for sins in a previous life, she was now reaping the consequences. The old lady had a moment of great realization and would go home to offer more sacrifices before the Buddha. Two young children returning home from school stared curiously at the "straw marker." They did not understand the meaning of the "straw marker." They stood for a while, slowly took a few steps backward, and then ran away as fast as they could, laughing as they ran, perhaps thinking that sticking a "straw marker" on a hat was a laughable thing.

It is said that a fat pig can be exchanged for thousands of French francs. A cigar butt can cause two bums to fight. But, but a "human," the "spirit of all things," a person with complete features and limbs, is waiting to be sold with a straw marker, and no one even asks. I don't know if this situation has "always been this way"? But seeing that every passerby has no pity or sympathy for their kind being sold, one cannot help but feel that it is "more intense now"!

I left in a daze. I thought that if Du Fu were alive today, he would certainly sing loudly, "It's better to give birth to a pig than a child!"

### Sharing the Same Boat in Storms

— He Jia Zhi

(Two) Sorrow and Joy

Li Youxie first said that the dead cannot be brought back to life, and then talked about how alone the Ye family was, and then mentioned Qin Runzhi's words. Before Wei Cheng finished listening, he shook his head. As he shook his head, he felt a headache. He didn't hear many of the words. Madam Ye Er said, "Child, I am not helping your uncle to persuade you, what your uncle said is a flexible approach. I think it is a temporary solution. Now, good or bad, it is all in your mouth. If you say it's good, we will start with the wedding. The room I live in will be vacated immediately for you to use as a bridal chamber." Wei Cheng stared blankly at Madam Ye Er, Great Aunt Li Youxie, looking at each face, not saying anything. Great Aunt thought that Wei Cheng was considering, and helped Madam Ye Er to say a few words. Li Youxie said with a smile, "We will deal with everything externally. You don't need to say a word. Of course, whether it is me, Li Youxie, acting as Wei Cheng, or Second Sister-in-law, Great Aunt, acting as Wei Cheng, no one can say that after such a great tragedy, while the body is still cold, one would want to arrange a good marriage first. You don't need to worry about this. We will announce it to your relatives and friends, and we can also expect that each and every one of them will advise you." The three elders forced a smile onto Wei Cheng's face covered in frost. But this smile was like a flash in the pan. When it appeared, he said, "I really don't understand why I was born a person and read some books." These were just two cold sentences, and there was no more to say. Madam Ye Er was the first to understand, and smiled along with him, "Uncle, let's not talk about this. Wei Cheng, he doesn't want to. Isn't he saying that a person cannot do this, and reading books cannot do this? Originally, Miss Wei has never been seen, whether she is thin or fat, whether she is virtuous or naughty. The matchmaker's temper is that nine out of ten lie, so it is no wonder that Wei Cheng is unwilling. I said that the wedding should be held, and this marriage should fall on Sister Cuizhen." Wei Cheng showed a smile, like a flash in the pan, and said, "Sister Cuizhen." Great Aunt thought this was an opportunity to interject, and quickly said:

"Sister Cuizhen is your best friend. The fortune teller has calculated her fate. She will suffer hardships when she is young, but she will have a husband-assisting luck when she grows up. Yes, this is much better than the girl from the Wei family. I guess Wei Cheng will never rebut this." (40)

### A Child's Sleeping Face

— Zhang Yufen

Some people say that a child's sleeping face is pure and lovely.

I once thought so and gazed at him. But now, I don't think so. Late at night, awake alone, gazing at the sleeping child, the more I gaze, the more desolate my heart becomes. His cheeks are a healthy and bloody red; his skin has no wrinkles etched by worry. But behind that unknowingly sublime face, isn't there a terrifying dark fate, coldly and maliciously spying?

How will a child live and how will he die? No one can know these things. And people, because of mutual hatred, are inadvertently arranging a world that is difficult for a child to live in.

The unknowable fate has placed such a heavy burden on the child's shoulders. Isn't this already enough? And can't people, because of their mutual hatred, throw even more unbearable burdens to that child? (No payment accepted)

### A Thousand Difficulties, Ten Thousand Hardships

— Wen Zhen

I don't know how much effort it took to earn a few banknotes.

I don't know how much strength it took to squeeze out a liter of foreign rice.

I don't know how much I walked to buy a few coal balls.

Only then can I have a meal to eat.
