### Gandhi, Nehru, and Azad, the Three Giants of India, Suddenly Arrested - Dozens of Congress Leaders Arrested, Britain Adopts Emergency Measures Against the Independence Movement

Lisbon, 9th (Domei News Agency) – According to news from Bombay, the British authorities in India suddenly arrested the three major leaders, Gandhi, Nehru, and Azad, this morning to suppress the disobedience movement in India. Many others were also arrested, but the number is unknown. A special train carrying those arrested left Victoria Station at 7:20 AM, heading approximately 120 miles southeast of Bombay to Poona. Gandhi was arrested at 5 AM. Three police cars arrived at Gandhi's residence and instructed him to prepare for imprisonment. Gandhi prayed on his bed, then left with the police. His wife was not among those arrested, but she was allowed to accompany her husband. After discussion, she decided not to accompany him to jail. On Saturday night, Gandhi spoke to the All-India Congress Committee for two hours, handled some letters, and went to sleep late, feeling quite tired. On Sunday morning, he woke up as usual at 4 AM and performed morning prayers in bed. Shortly after 5 AM, Gandhi received notification that the police chief was knocking on the door of Mr. Polak's residence, wanting to meet Gandhi's secretary, Desai. The police chief carried arrest warrants, according to the Defence of India Ordinance, for Gandhi, Desai, and Miss Mirabehn. Mirabehn was arrested at her residence along with her father. Congress Secretary Kriplani was also arrested there, and former Governor of Bombay, Mr. Kher, was arrested in Bombay. Around 2 AM on Sunday morning, telephone communication in Bombay was disrupted. When Gandhi and others arrested left Polak's residence and entered the police car, the men and women who came to pray in front of the door every morning shouted "Long live Gandhi!" Gandhi smiled and replied, walking slowly to the car with Mirabehn, in excellent spirits. When the large car carrying Gandhi went to the railway station, the police chief drove ahead in another car. When they arrived at the station, a special train was waiting to carry the arrested people. English newspapers in Bombay immediately issued special editions after the event, informing the public of the arrests. Among those arrested were Mahmad, Sitaramayya, Asaf Ali, all members of the Standing Committee, and the socialist Taif. Congress President Azad and his secretary were arrested at Mr. Desai's residence, where they were staying.

Lisbon, 9th (Domei News Agency) – The total number of National Congress leaders arrested in Bombay, including Gandhi and other Standing Committee members, now reaches 54.

Lisbon, 9th (Domei News Agency) – According to British radio news received here, the Indian Governor-General's office, because the All-India Congress Party's All-India Congress had passed a resolution requesting the withdrawal of British forces, has begun suppression. At dawn on the 9th, they suddenly surrounded the bedrooms of the three giants, Gandhi, Nehru, and Azad, and arrested them. They also sent troops to arrest 20 other leaders of the faction, and it is rumored that the arrested cadres of the National Congress Party are being transported to Calcutta by special train. Many Congress cadres were also arrested in Poona and Allahabad. In addition, the Indian Governor-General's office has banned the publication of the contents of the resolution passed by the All-India Congress.

Bombay, 9th (Havas News Agency) – The three major leaders of the Indian National Congress Party, namely Gandhi, Nehru, and Azad, have been arrested by the government authorities in accordance with the provisions of the Defence of India Ordinance. Gandhi's English secretary, Miss Slade, was also arrested at the same time. However, Gandhi's wife refused to accompany Gandhi to the confinement location, Aga Khan Palace. All executive members of the Indian National Congress Party who participated in the recent meeting have been arrested. According to news from Ahmedabad, police went to the residences of leaders everywhere this morning to search. As of now, 10 people have been arrested under the Penal Code, and 17 people have been arrested under the Defence of India Ordinance.

Congress Passes Independence Resolution

Chongqing, 9th (Domei News Agency) – According to news from Bombay, today is the second day of the All-India National Congress Party meeting in Bombay. The majority, except for 13 votes, supported the Executive Committee's resolution to "Quit India." Gandhi launched a disobedience movement, the first step of which was to ask all Indian newspapers to stop publishing until India gained independence, and to ask professors and students to stop teaching and studying. The British authorities believe that this will throw India into chaos and hinder its war effort, and have also taken two steps: first, to prohibit newspapers from publishing the mass movements approved by the Congress Party and the British methods of dealing with them; second, to strengthen the power of the British authorities in India to achieve the effect of suppression. It is said that the three Indian leaders, Gandhi, Azad, and Nehru, are determined to achieve independence with the determination to die. However, Muslim groups have not yet expressed their opinions.

Gandhi Speaks at Congress

Bangkok, 9th (Haitong News Agency) – According to news received here from Bombay this morning, after the All-India Congress Party passed the "Quit India" proposal yesterday, Mahatma Gandhi addressed the Congress, saying, "I cannot wait any longer for the liberation of India. If I hesitate any longer, God will punish me." This is Gandhi's last appeal to the British conscience, and also the last appeal for Indian unity. Because his speech was checked by the British authorities, it was delayed for many hours when it was transmitted abroad, and it was incomplete. In his speech, he said, "I am not afraid of death. Although I seek to live, I know that I will not be in this world for long. My death will inevitably promote the liberation of India. The policy of the All-India Congress Party is based on non-violence, so that India can gain freedom. Is it a crime if the Congress Party asks for the liberation of India? Even if the whole world is my enemy, I am not afraid. Even if all the Allied Powers oppose me, I will continue my journey. Regarding Britain's attitude towards India, Gandhi said that the British government has had sufficient time and opportunity to promise India freedom to show its sincerity. Now, what history will record is 'Britain has lost its duty to India.' I have nothing more to say to Britain. Regarding the Muslim proposal for partition, I propose to submit it to a court of arbitration. If the Muslims do not accept this suggestion, then they cannot expect others to accept their power politics. I personally am not against partition, but all of India must first be liberated from foreign imperialism. I can no longer wait for the Muslim leader Jinnah to participate in the Indian liberation movement. The unity of India is necessary, but India's freedom must not only be the freedom of a particular society, it must be the freedom of all. Selfishness is the greatest obstacle to the overall interest. Regarding the 'Quit India' proposal, before starting its disobedience movement, it will send another letter to the Indian Governor-General. Every Indian must regard himself as a free man, because there is no room for compromise regarding the liberation of India. Cowards do not deserve to live. The start of the disobedience movement is the closure of newspapers and schools throughout India."

Nehru Makes Fiery Remarks

Bombay, 8th (Havas News Agency) – Indian National Congress Party leader Nehru recently told reporters after attending a meeting that "the sense of superiority of the British nation" can no longer be tolerated. The Indian nation will no longer be intimidated by threats. It must be known that our sincerity is thorough, and it is hoped that the world will recognize this. For we are now facing a cliff, and we cannot be free unless we fulfill our long-cherished wish for independence.

Saigon, 9th (Haitong News Agency) – Nehru's speech to the Executive Committee of the Congress Party yesterday included openly anti-British remarks, saying, "Indians refuse to be threatened by the British any longer. On the contrary, if the British want to threaten India again at this time, it will only destroy their position. In this world, there are other nations besides the Anglo-Saxons. We can no longer tolerate the Anglo-Saxons being the dominant nation."

Indian Government's Attitude Firm

New Delhi, 8th (Havas News Agency) – Reuter reports that the government authorities have announced that they will not negotiate with the National Congress Party on a basis that would lead India into a state of anarchy and chaos. Therefore, the situation in India is becoming more tense. The government authorities also prohibit the publication of any news about any mass movement initiated by the Executive Committee of the Party. From this, it can be seen that the authorities have decided to deal firmly with the Indian national movement. As for what measures the government will take to suppress this mass movement, nothing is known. It is only known that all public speeches and news are prohibited, but official or semi-official news issued by news agencies is not subject to this restriction.

Saigon, 9th (Haitong News Agency) – The obligations of the people of India will conflict. If the Congress Party's demands are approved, it will lead India into chaos. At this critical moment, the Congress Party has issued this kind of "provocation." We regret it very much, but the Indian government will still fulfill its obligations and maintain India's ability to fight. The self-government has learned of the Congress Party's illegal "dangerous action preparations." Now, in order to fulfill its responsibilities to India and friendly countries, the government must deal with it accordingly. It is hoped that the people of India will not regard it as a punitive measure, and it is hoped that the people of India will abandon their prejudices and unite with the government during this war period to oppose the Congress Party. Moreover, the Congress Party's demands are also opposed by all factions in India. Therefore, if the government accepts them, it will violate the interests of all factions of Indians. Britain's future policy towards India is very clear, that is, to continue to implement the same policy.

Bombay Transportation Agencies Shut Down

Lisbon, 9th (Domei News Agency) – According to intelligence, the All-India Committee of the National Congress Party, in order to deal with Britain's distrust of India, has decided to start a non-cooperation movement against Britain. At 4 PM on the 8th (7 PM Shanghai time on the 8th), a directive for the All-India non-cooperation movement was issued in the name of Gandhi. The anti-British mass movement has begun, and as a result, telegrams, telephones, and postal services have all been shut down, newspapers have stopped publishing, schools have stopped classes, and all transportation agencies have also been shut down. According to Reuter in Bombay, employees of transportation agencies in Bombay went on strike together after Gandhi issued the directive. Therefore, except for the port area, all transportation agencies in the city have stopped. The city of Bombay has fallen into great chaos.

Saigon, 9th (Haitong News Agency) – After the British authorities arrested the leaders of the All-India Congress Party, many riots have occurred in Bombay. Although the British censorship is very strict, according to leaked news, all telephone lines in Bombay have been cut off. Today, news was received from Bombay that Indian civilians in the streets of Bombay have had their first conflict with the British army. Although the news has been censored, according to the British official announcement, the situation of the conflict is extremely serious. The police authorities have banned all demonstrations.

### Moscow Talks Underway - The Second Front Rumored to Be Opened Soon, Hitler to Inspect Naval Bases

London, 8th (Havas News Agency) – British Radio tonight broadcast news confirming that important talks are currently underway in Moscow, but it did not mention whether British Prime Minister Churchill is in the Soviet Union.

Lisbon, 9th (Haitong News Agency) – According to news received here from the American news agency, an Allied military conference is being held in Moscow. The Moscow radio station declared that the plan for the Second Front is about to be realized. This news did not mention Churchill, apparently due to news censorship.

Berne, Switzerland, 8th (Havas News Agency) – The Allied countries are holding a military conference in Moscow. All circles in Switzerland have heard nothing about the issues discussed at this conference. However, London political figures believe that the recent setbacks suffered by the Soviet Red Army will induce the Allied countries to establish a unified command, which will not only directly command military affairs, but also distribute all military supplies to the war zones. According to Swiss press news, the Indian issue is mostly on the agenda. The Soviet government has always regarded Indian leaders as having some political influence, especially Nehru, who has the power to influence them. The British government seems to want to ask Soviet politicians to put pressure on them so that more difficult situations do not occur for Britain. The Swiss newspaper reported that the most important issue is the establishment of a unified command and the implementation of dictatorship over all economic resources of the Allied countries, which will also be included. This measure seems to be the best. In this way, the Soviet Union can demand a large amount of assistance from the Allied countries, and the Allied countries can change the military equipment originally sent to Australia for use in assisting the Soviet Union. There are many people in Australia who oppose it, and in the future, no one can oppose it again. If the Allied countries can open a second front, the Soviet Union will be happy to accept the proposal for a unified command. Therefore, it can be asserted that the two issues of opening a second front and establishing a unified command must be resolved simultaneously.

Istanbul, 8th (Havas News Agency) – Rumors that American Ambassador to Turkey, Steinhardt, has departed for Moscow have recently been denied by well-informed sources here.

Stockholm, Sweden, 8th (Havas News Agency) – According to the Swedish newspaper today, the German ministers held an important meeting a few days ago to discuss major issues, in addition to the Second Front and its impact on the occupied areas, and also discussed major economic issues.

Berlin, 8th (Havas News Agency) – German Navy Commander-in-Chief Admiral Raeder has been inspecting naval bases in the English Channel and along the Atlantic coast since the 2nd of this month, and it has only just concluded today.

### Summer Disease Prevention - Epidemics Often Caused by Dietary Carelessness - A Strong Stomach and Intestines Can Reduce Infection

Those annoying flies are flying all over the world. Because of their coming and going, they are lurking everywhere for human life crises. The most important intestinal diseases include: dysentery, typhoid fever, etc. With a little carelessness, they will deprive you of your life. The reason for contracting these diseases is mostly due to carelessness in diet, bringing these various dysentery bacteria and typhoid bacteria into the intestines, giving them the opportunity to breed and rage in the human body. Their symptoms are briefly written below! "Cholera," commonly known as cholera, is the most terrible epidemic, which may end people's lives in a very short period! Light cases are nothing more than vomiting and diarrhea a few times, feeling a headache or dizziness, slight fatigue, and cold limbs, and can be cured in about a week, while severe cases are often fatal, with severe vomiting and excretion, sunken eye sockets, sunken finger nails, pale face, thirst, low and hoarse voice, and convulsions. But people with weak bodies are more likely to get this disease. If you take the body-strengthening and blood-tonifying "Ruosu" and become physically strong, with strong resistance to bacteria, you will never be able to breathe this kind of thing.

"Typhoid fever" usually lasts about four weeks. In the first week, the appetite is not strong, fatigue and fever. In the second week, the temperature increases, about 39 degrees and 40 degrees Celsius, the consciousness is unclear, delirium, the tongue coating is dry, dark and thick, and the tip of the tongue is peeled off. This week is the most dangerous. If you still do not pay attention in the third week, such as intestinal ulcers, even bleeding, perforation, and the temperature will drop, you will inevitably die from collapse; but if you survive the third week without this phenomenon, the body temperature will return to normal after the fourth week, and all the symptoms will disappear? That is, they will gradually recover.

"Dysentery" is generally divided into red and white, but red dysentery is more serious, and it is popularly called dysentery. Mild cases are similar to colitis, with severe abdominal pain, urgency to defecate, and mucus in the stool. However, in severe cases, ulcers form in the intestines, with thick blood in the stool, fatigue, weakness, and lack of energy, and the number of defecations increases, often leading to death.

Looking at the above three diseases, due to temporary carelessness, you will suffer great pain, and even death. How can you not be wary? Therefore, the ancients said: "Disease enters through the mouth, and disaster comes out of the mouth." This is indeed true. However, dietary caution cannot be so accurate and guaranteed. Now, there is a savior. More reliable and convenient than getting vaccinations is the most famous "Ruosu." It is the most reliable and safest preventive medicine. If you do not want to suffer from disease, quickly take this great Ruosu. "Ruosu" contains vitamin B, powerful digestive enzymes, and hormones, so it has special effects. (Available in pharmacies everywhere.) The German newspaper "Norwegian Preparation for Self-Defense" recently published an interview with General Fockhorst, commander of the German forces stationed in Norway. It stated that "the Norwegian coast is rugged and steep, originally a natural fortress. In addition, wherever the enemy can easily land, we have deployed fortifications. Moreover, our fortification work is based on past experiences gained on other battlefields. The scale of its magnificence is something that enemy air force personnel cannot imagine. And the German forces stationed in Norway are equipped with the most elite equipment in the world, so they can be prepared for any external attacks."

### German Tank and Infantry Forces Approach the Foothills of the Caucasus Mountains; the Situation in the Oil Industry Center is Critical; Stalingrad is Under Siege

Stockholm, September 9th, Havas News Agency: The 60th week of the German-Soviet War began today, and the German summer offensive has lasted for six weeks. It appears the German army will soon achieve its goals, namely, to occupy Krasnodar, the Maikop oil fields, the Volga River, Stalingrad, and the port of Novorossiysk. The war situation in each theater is summarized as follows: Heavy fighting continues in the western part of the southern front, with the German army maintaining its advantage. After occupying Rostov, the German army crossed the Don River, making it difficult to draw a battle line on the map. To understand the situation on both sides, it is necessary to study the battles on each line individually. For example, in the western part of the southern front, on the coast of Azov, the German army is carrying out mopping-up operations and has reached the Kuban River Delta. The city of Temryuk remains in the hands of the Red Army, but its communication lines to the east have been cut off and it is under threat from the German army from the northeast. According to unconfirmed reports, the German army has crossed the Taman Strait and established an important stronghold in Temryuk. The oil industry center of Krasnodar has been surrounded by the German army and is under threat from all sides, especially from the west and southwest. Although the Red Army is putting up fierce resistance, the fate of Krasnodar is sealed and it is in imminent danger. The situation in Maikop is similar. The German army has launched a two-pronged attack from Armavir. It is only a matter of time before the German army occupies the city. The war in the eastern part of the southern front has reached a decisive stage. The German army is intensifying its siege of Stalingrad. The German army has reached the Ilovlya River, and once it crosses the river, there will be no natural obstacles to attacking Stalingrad. Therefore, the encirclement strategy adopted by the German army in the Stalingrad area can be said to have ended, and its surprising results will soon be revealed. In the Elista area, the Red Army continues its counter-offensive with increasing intensity, but the Soviet side remains silent on this.

Bern, September 9th, Allied News Agency: Moscow officially acknowledged that Soviet forces in the Caucasus region are continuing to retreat along the Don River. The German tank corps and mobile infantry under Bock's command have continued to advance in the Armavir area, where they made a wedge-shaped penetration several days ago, forcing Soviet forces to retreat to new positions. Moscow sources said that Soviet forces are engaging in fierce defensive battles against the German army, and Soviet forces are fighting hard on the banks of the Kuban River in Kropotkin, 50 miles north of Armavir. After German tanks broke through Soviet strongholds in the Krasnodar area, they are now approaching the Maikop oil fields at the foot of the Caucasus Mountains, reaching a point only 17 miles from Krasnodar. As for the German forces on the eastern front, they are continuing to penetrate deep into the Kotelnikovo area (southwest of Stalingrad). Soviet forces in the Kletskaya area, 100 kilometers northwest of Stalingrad, have also been forced to retreat to new positions.

Fuehrer Headquarters, September 9th, Haitong News Agency: Today's German war report stated that German, Romanian, and Slovak troops have reached the northern foothills of the Caucasus Mountains. The bridgehead across the Kuban River is still under fighting. North of Krasnodar, enemy troops still occupy the area. Our troops crossed the Laba district and advanced westward. Our aircraft pursued and attacked the retreating enemy troops along the highways and railways. In the port of Anapa, three Soviet barges were sunk by bombs, and one cargo ship was damaged. Between the Volga and Don Rivers, southwest of Stalingrad, enemy forces launched fierce counter-attacks, but were eventually repelled. In the large bend of the Don River, our troops continue to attack north of the Kalach district.

### German Forces Capture Temryuk; Krasnodar Surrounded

Somewhere on the Ukrainian border, September 8th, Havas News Agency: It has just been learned that a large German force crossed the Kerch Strait this month, landed on the Taman Peninsula, occupied several bridgeheads, and then captured Temryuk. According to frontline reports, the vanguard of the German-Romanian forces reached the outskirts of Krasnodar tonight. After the German army controlled the Taman Peninsula, the Soviet Black Sea Fleet had only a few important bases available, and the most important of these, the port of Novorossiysk, is also under threat of attack by the German army.

Somewhere on the Soviet border, September 8th, Havas News Agency: Today is the 412th day of the German-Soviet War, and the 40th day of the German offensive. Although the Red Army is putting up a determined resistance in the Kuban River basin, its defenses are about to collapse. Krasnodar has been surrounded by the German army on three sides. The Red Army High Command is very conservative in its use of tanks, and the Red Army's mechanical equipment is not comparable to that of the German army. Part of General Manstein's forces have landed on the Taman Peninsula and occupied Temryuk. Although not officially confirmed, Novorossiysk is indeed under threat. As for Stalingrad, which is considered the most solid point of the Red Army's defenses, it has now reached the most critical stage. The German army has approached the suburbs of the city from the southwest, and the Red Army is preparing for a German attack from the west. Between the Don and Sal Rivers, the Red Army's resistance is particularly fierce. In addition, the Red Army is fighting a desperate battle in the Elista area. It is reported that the Red Army is launching a local offensive on the Volkhov River.

Berlin, September 9th, Haiyong News Agency: After breaking through the Soviet defenses north and northeast of Krasnodar, the German army is now engaged in a major battle for the city. The city, originally named Ekaterinodar, is the seat of government for the Kuban region and a railway center with a population of over 200,000. The Kuban region covers an area of 88,600 square kilometers and has a population of about 3,000,000. The Caucasus Mountains start south of Krasnodar, and the railway from Stalingrad to Novorossiysk also passes through the city.

### The Plague-Infected Area of Route Conty Has Been Completely Sealed Off; Residents of the Sealed Area of 25,000 People Can Only Enter and Exit with Vaccination Certificates and Baojia Certificates

Yesterday, Quarantine Was Strictly Enforced at All Border Gaps Between the Two Concessions

Six cases of bubonic plague occurred in the Route Conty area of the French Concession two days ago, with two deaths. The French Police Department, in conjunction with the Health Department, has completely sealed off the plague-infected area to prevent the spread. The Shanghai Japanese Marine Corps and the health authorities of the two concessions have announced that houses where bubonic plague has occurred must be quarantined and that no contact with the outside world is allowed without the permission of the authorities. Therefore, the French authorities have taken this severe action.

### Measures in the Plague Area

According to an official of the Health Department, the sealed-off area of Route Conty has about 25,000 residents, all of whom are poor Chinese. Their homes are cramped, and most have not been vaccinated. The health authorities received a report two days ago that bubonic plague had occurred in the area. Four of the cases were determined to be bubonic plague, and the remaining two were also suspected of being infected with bubonic plague. The authorities ordered the area to be sealed off and sent personnel to investigate, and ordered vaccination and disinfection teams to the scene to carry out their work to prevent the spread of the plague. Residents of the sealed-off area were prohibited from traveling freely. Those holding vaccination certificates or Baojia residence certificates were allowed to go out to work or buy food. To enter or exit the sealed-off area, it was necessary to hold both of these certificates. The period of the seal has not yet been determined and will depend on the progress of the epidemic prevention work in the area. The seal will only be lifted when the authorities are satisfied with the epidemic prevention measures and believe that bubonic plague will not recur.

### Entry and Exit with Certificates in the French Concession

Chinese and Western police officers are stationed at each iron gate at the border between the concession and the Chinese city, and all pedestrians entering and exiting must present vaccination certificates. Those without certificates or holding expired certificates are forced to receive cholera vaccinations. Starting yesterday, some unimportant traffic lanes along Avenue Edward VII, Avenue Foch, and the border between the Public Concession and the French Concession were sealed off with barbed wire. However, pedestrians and vehicles are allowed to pass through the Bund, Rue de la Cathédrale, Old North Gate Street, Xinqiao Street, Great World, Rue Bayle, Rue Sainte-Marie, Avenue Albert, and Route Haig, but they must present vaccination certificates, in order to cooperate fully with the Public Concession and the municipal authorities to prevent the spread of the epidemic. French Police Department patrols have recently been inspecting pedestrians' vaccination certificates, just as is done in the Public Concession.

### Number of Vaccinations

The Health Department disclosed that from the beginning of July to Thursday, a total of 1,645 cases of bubonic plague have occurred, including 353 in the French Concession, 1,022 in the Chinese city, and 260 in the Public Concession. On Thursday, 35,056 people were vaccinated in the Public Concession and 27,718 in the French Concession. The total number of vaccinations to date is 1,838,338 in the French Concession and approximately 1,750,000 in the Public Concession.

### The Sixth Phase of Food Rations Will Be Distributed Today

According to a reporter from Datong News Agency, the rice shops in the two concessions have completed the collection of the sixth phase of household rice from the Rice and Grain Office at the Swire and Jardine godowns. Starting at 8:00 a.m. today, the rice can be distributed to the public by presenting the rice purchase certificate. Each rice purchase certificate can be used to purchase one "sheng" of white rice and half a "sheng" of broken rice for 3.8 yuan in reserve certificates, and one "jin" of flour for 2.3 yuan in reserve certificates. However, the purchase of flour is optional and will not be forced.

Applications for Food Rations for Special Purposes Continue to Be Processed as Usual

The Rice and Grain Office will continue to process applications from restaurants, factories, hospitals, and schools for the allocation of food rations for special purposes, and will not stop processing these applications because of the distribution of household rice. However, those who receive food rations for special purposes may no longer receive household rice. Applications for household rice for residents of straw huts who do not have property tax receipts can also be submitted. Most of the household rice for residents, servants, and employees of churches, temples, schools, and other organizations has already been collected, and the process is going very smoothly.

### Death of Mr. Qin Ping, Former Editor of This Newspaper

Mr. Qin Pingfu of Wuxi was a pure and erudite scholar, well-versed in old news, national history, historical geography, and academic studies. He served as a teacher at Wuxi Normal School, Songjiang Middle School, and other schools, and as the director of the Wuxi Library and the Historical Museum. He made great contributions to the field of education. In the early years of the Republic of China, he was hired as an editor by this newspaper and enjoyed a close friendship with the editor-in-chief, Mr. Zhang Junmo. His eldest son, Liqi, also served as an English editor at this newspaper. The father and son worked diligently and provided valuable assistance. Liqi died young, and in his later years, Mr. Qin Pingfu also suffered from a paralytic disease. Amidst the chaos and turmoil, he experienced unexpected hardships. He had been bedridden in his hometown for many years and suddenly passed away on the 7th of this month from heat stroke. He died in his hometown at the age of 70. He is survived by three sons, one daughter-in-law, all of whom predeceased him, and two young children. Throughout his life, he was upright, sincere, and frugal. He had many students, all of whom were well-established. It is a pity that heaven did not spare him, and we have lost this great figure. We extend our condolences. Those who have past relationships with Mr. Qin and wish to express their respects may send their contributions to the Wuxi Association, located at 218 Qipu Road (telephone 40694), which will be remitted to his family in Wuxi in August to help defray expenses.

### Police Internal Notices Are All Changed to Japanese; The Public Concession Japanese Class Opens

The Public Concession Bureau has officially established a Japanese language class starting today for employees to learn Japanese language and literature in their spare time. Four hundred and fourteen people have registered, including 166 Chinese and 248 Westerners. It is understood that the Japanese Consulate General is recommending six Japanese language teachers so that all registrants can be admitted. The Japanese language class that opens today has five classes for male Western employees, one class for female Western employees, and a total of four classes for male and female Chinese employees. Each class has approximately 36 to 40 students. Most of the Western employees who are entering the class belong to the Technical Department. The teachers total five people. Among the Western employees who have registered for admission are Walter Gold, Deputy Director of the Fire Department, and Major Battey, Commander of the U.S. Merchant Marines. It is also understood that the internal notices of the Public Concession Police Department's General Patrol Room, the 14 district police stations, the Ward Road Prison, and the Reserve Force have all been changed to Japanese.

### The Review of the Applications for the Student Aid Fund's Elementary and Middle School Group Has Been Completed; The Approved List Will Be Published Starting Tomorrow

The elementary and middle school test papers for the Student Aid Fund have all been graded. The review process has been carried out for several days, and the economic situation of the applicants' families has been investigated separately to ensure thoroughness. The review standards this time are based on the results of the screening examination, but if there are applicants who have passed the exam but whose family economic situation is considered well-off, they may not be admitted. Conversely, if the grades are slightly lower but the family situation is truly impoverished, assistance will still be considered. The complete approved list will be published in this newspaper successively from tomorrow without further notice. Please pay attention. The interviews with the industrial and commercial group have also been completed and will be announced after the elementary and middle school group. As for the university group, interviews and reviews will also begin. This time, Mr. Xu Xuehai and Mr. Ding Guangxun of the YMCA Student Relief Department reviewed and graded all of the elementary and middle school test papers in the sweltering heat, with enthusiasm and service. I am deeply grateful.

### Living Standards of Chinese Employees; Compiled by the Public Concession Industrial and Social Affairs Department (5)

The expenses of an employee's family for social activities are greater than those of a worker, either due to the nature of their work or due to interactions with relatives and friends. Wedding, funeral, and gift expenses are a regular expense. Reciprocity is indispensable. Other expenses such as clothing and household expenses are also necessary. The war has continued for five years, and it is necessary to replenish these items. The following table lists the percentage of total expenditure accounted for by this item:

Item Percentage of Total Expenditure Note 7
Social 1.50
Membership fees 0.20
Gifts 4.24
Clothing expenses 12.74

Nutrition of Employee Families

Detailed analysis by Dr. Li De of the Lester Institute for Medical Research shows that it is generally suitable. However, family incomes vary, ranging from 200 yuan to more than 1,800 yuan. Therefore, the nutrition of those with lower incomes is far below the level. The main points of Li's analysis are recorded below: In terms of quantity and type, the diet of employees is better than that of workers. The former reaches 305 items, while the latter only reaches 122 items. The more types there are, the more opportunities there are to obtain foods with known and unknown nutritional value. Employees get 2,735 calories from food, which is above the standard number (2,400), and 4% higher than the calories workers get. This kind of calories comes from meat and vegetables. We should get 55 grams of protein from our food, one-third of which should come from animal substances, and vegetarians should get 80 grams. Now employees get 80 grams of protein, of which 13.19 grams come from meat. In terms of quantity, it has exceeded the standard. The fat content is still considered suitable, but there are too many carbohydrates, with a heating value of 335 calories. This is due to the fact that grain consumption is far beyond what is needed. The supply of inorganic salts is also appropriate, and calcium is quite sufficient, coming from vegetables, especially bok choy and mustard greens. The various vitamins are also not deficient, but vitamins B and C are damaged by prolonged cooking. Fruits, nuts, and other foods rich in vitamins are consumed very little. Therefore, the vitamins are mostly obtained from meals. Li believes that the proportion of rice in the diet is too high and can be replaced with other grains such as wheat and millet. For families with children, egg consumption should be increased from 8 grams per day to one egg, which is 50 grams. Although the protein content is sufficient, the quality is poor. If economic conditions permit, the amount of meat protein obtained by each child per month should be increased from 2 ounces to 3 ounces. Also, if fresh milk is too expensive, more beans and bean products can be eaten.

Family residences are especially small, with an average of 7.6 people occupying 2.5 standard rooms (150 square feet), with each room averaging 3.04 people. The size of a standard room varies depending on the type of house. The standard for workers is 1,000 cubic feet. For the convenience of comparison, 150 square feet is used as a common unit. The table below lists the number of people per room:

Family Average number of people per room (150 square feet per room)
Chinese employees 3.04
Chinese workers 7.30

Since August 13, the population of the city has increased greatly, and housing is crowded. The size of housing depends on income. Rent is a major expense in employee families.

The amount spent on physical and mental development in employee families is very small. Among 100 families, 35 subscribe to daily newspapers and 22 buy magazines. The number of people who buy books related to their profession or culture is rare. Even university teachers cannot afford to buy books. Other expenses such as library fees and transportation fees are all absent. The rise in prices, the difficulty of purchasing, the depletion of savings, and the instability of employment are all concerns of general employees. This is recorded in more detail in the books, and daily expenses are indispensable. Therefore, there are many people who use speculation to supplement their income. Small living spaces, lack of exercise, and constant worries all affect work efficiency. It can be seen that it is necessary to adjust and stabilize the lives of employee families. Note 7: Consumer and non-consumer expenditure is 100%.

### Smuggling Case in the Haig Road Involved Customs Workers

Between November 29 of the previous year, when Zhu Boquan was traveling in his own car to the Bankers' Association to work, he was kidnapped by bandits on Haig Road and forced to pay a large ransom. After paying tens of thousands of yuan, he escaped safely. Recently, after receiving a confidential tip from Detective Tang Jian and Detective Chen Dabao of the Hongkou Police Station, they arrested Shi Jixiang (39 years old), a native of three places, on the 4th of last month in a rural house at 17 Xujiazhai on the Great Western Road for interrogation. He unexpectedly recanted his confession in the police station, claiming that the case was initiated by Liu Zhenguo, and completely denied all the facts. It was found that he had been working in the printing department of the Customs Registration Office on Xinza Road for more than ten years. It is also alleged that a worker in the same department named Zhu A Si also participated in this case. He was ordered to await trial while the Customs Registration Office investigated whether he was working in the printing department at the time. The investigation was adjourned. The detective went to the office with the court's official letter, and it was confirmed that Shi Jixiang was indeed a worker in the printing department and had been there for eleven years. The photo, age, origin certificate, and paper taken when he was working there were handed over to the case. Yesterday, the presiding judge tirelessly sought details, without bias or leniency, and interrogated the defendant for a long time. He still resolutely denied the charges and claimed that he had not worked in the printing department of the Customs Registration Office prior to the incident. When he was shown his photo certificate, he finally admitted it. The case was returned to the detention center and the sentencing date was set.

### French Authorities Are Considering Opening All Iron Gates in the Nanshi Area

Since the outbreak of the Shanghai Incident in 1937, all the iron gates in the area of Min'guo Road on the border between Nanshi, the Chinese City and the French Concession have been closed. In the early spring of 1939, five iron gates at Xin Kai He (now Lao Bei Men), Shiliupu, Nanyang Bridge, and Xieqiao were opened to facilitate traffic between the North and South Cities. It has been more than two years since then. Local gentry in Nanshi have requested that the authorities of the French Concession be consulted to open all the iron gates in order to facilitate passage and revitalize the Nanshi commercial district, because the existing five open iron gates do not provide adequate transportation. It has been said that approval has been granted and that all gates will be opened in early August. It is now heard that the French Concession authorities are still considering the opening of all iron gates in relation to the issues of security and epidemic prevention in the concession. Therefore, the date of implementation has not yet been determined.

### Autumn Flood Tide Prediction: Tide Level at Thirteen Feet, Parallel to the Bank

According to a report from Datong, a reporter in Shanghai has learned that every year during the autumn season, there is an autumn flood tide, which is much higher than the tides in spring, summer, and winter. According to the records of the Dredging Bureau, the autumn flood tide has reached over fourteen feet, exceeding the Bund embankment by more than one foot, causing the road to be submerged. However, there are no such records in other flood seasons.

Factors Contributing to High Tide

The reasons for the particularly high autumn tide in the Huangpu River are nothing more than: 1. Melting snow and ice in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, causing a sharp rise in the water level of the middle and lower reaches. Wusong is located at the end of the Yangtze River, and the Yangtze's discharge inevitably flows into the Huangpu River. 2. The autumn flood season coincides with Shanghai's hurricane season, increasing the chances of being hit, causing the tide to be stirred up by the wind. 3. The distance between the moon and the earth is also closest in autumn, and the tide is drawn up by the moon's gravity. The above three points are the main factors.

Preventive Measures

It is now the beginning of autumn. According to the Dredging Bureau's forecast, from the 12th to the 18th, there will be six days of high tides, all of which will be at thirteen feet, parallel to the Bund embankment. If there is wind and rain, the tide level will rise further. If a hurricane coincides with this, the roads of Shanghai will inevitably be submerged in water. However, according to those who study the Huangpu River's water conservancy, there is only one chance in ten that a hurricane will coincide with a high tide. At the same time, the Bund has been built with slopes, and the anti-flood works of the warehouses are also very thorough, so the impact of the tide will inevitably be reduced.

### 31 Fire Alarms in the French Concession Last Month; The Most Severe Was on Rue Cardinal Mercier

The French Concession Fire Brigade reported that there were 31 fire alarms in the French Concession in the past month. The brigade was called to the scene 19 times, eight times due to special accidents, and four times due to false alarms. The fire brigade's report also stated that in the past month, except for the fire on Rue Cardinal Mercier on July 19th, which required eight fire engines to extinguish and destroyed a row of Chinese shops and houses, the other fires did not spread violently. Therefore, July 19th was the busiest day for the fire brigade, and on that day, they received four fire alarms within ten hours. In the special accidents, the fire brigade was called twice for attempted suicide cases. In the first case, a Chinese man who intended to commit suicide was rescued by his neighbors and sent to the hospital for treatment. In the second case, a Chinese woman hanged herself in her house. When the fire brigade arrived, the woman had already died. The fire brigade also inspected 230 houses in July and installed fire prevention devices.

### Buddhist Academic Weekly Lectures

Ma Gongyu Lectured on Buddhism and Art; The Third Lecture of the Buddhist Academic Weekly Lecture at Jing'an Temple Was Held Yesterday. Jinshi painter and calligrapher Ma Gongyu lectured on Buddhism and art, briefly stating that Chinese art, since the introduction of Buddhism, has been greatly influenced both in theory and in technique. Its lofty spirit, rich imagination, and transcendent artistic conception are indeed the embodiment of the great national spirit. About 700 people attended the lecture. It is reported that the fourth lecture next Sunday will be given by Elder Layman Ding Guiqiao, and the time will still be from 9:00 AM to 11:00 AM.

Publication of Elementary Swimming Techniques

Each book is priced at three yuan and is available at the YMCA on Sichuan Road and Baxianqiao.

### Casual Jottings: Random Notes on Strolling the Streets

Walking aimlessly on the streets is called "liūda" in the north, and "dàng mǎlù" by Shanghainese. The biggest advantage of strolling the streets is that you can enjoy the pleasure of sightseeing without spending a penny. ——However, if you are strolling too happily and suddenly buy a golden melon or a packet of peanuts from a street stall and eat and walk, or, even worse, step into a cafe and order a "polo sundae", and the bill comes to ten yuan for a "Special", then naturally this is not the case. Ordinary people yearn to stroll the streets with a woman, thinking that the scenery is beautiful and the pleasure is unparalleled. There was a time when the reporter, out of self-indulgence, listed strolling the streets as a daily mandatory lesson with a Miss, for three years. Accumulating three years of experience, I deeply know that this method is actually far from the meaning of strolling the streets. Because a real stroll must be alone, walking leisurely, stopping here for a while to look at the window displays of the shops, taking a few steps there to admire the strange and beautiful clothes, with a calm mind and a leisurely attitude, can you appreciate the true interest in this. If you are with a woman, you will probably be whispering sweet words, forgetting everything, and often bumping your nose into a lamppost or forgetting to stop at a red light. Roughly speaking, the two realms obviously have the distinction between "objective" and "subjective". Taking the Buddhist scriptures as an analogy, the former is emptiness is form, while the latter is form is emptiness.

There is a certain time for strolling the streets in each season. In winter, naturally, the afternoon when the long street is full of sunshine is the best. In the past, the reporter often took advantage of this time to slowly stroll from Chengdu Road along the Racecourse to Avenue Edward VII, looking around while the sun shone on my slightly curved back, and the warmth gradually circulated throughout my body. There was a feeling of physical and mental harmony. But in summer, strolling the streets must be done on cool and breezy nights. Those who venture out to stroll the streets in the hot sunshine during the day are either crazy or insane, and I disdain to discuss the pleasure of this with them.

The best time for strolling the streets on a summer night is in the two hours before curfew. Although there are beautiful sunsets to admire in the evening, the heat has not completely dissipated, and the streets are noisy with people, all of which can hinder the body and mind. It is better to choose the time around eleven or twelve o'clock. At this time, a cool breeze blows gently from the end of the sky, and most of the people cooling off on the streets are sleepy and want to sleep, and they are no longer as good at talking as they were two or three hours ago. So you can take advantage of this great time and happily stroll out, because the way is to stroll, so you don't need to have any purpose. You go wherever you like, and anyway, at this time, your body is already your own, and no one can force you to go to the office to work on those headache-inducing formulas or the Arabic numbers of a few yuan, a few cents, and a few mills.

If you have the leisurely mood of Shen Sanbai, the author of "Six Records of a Floating Life", then the first thing worth admiring after going out is the various sleeping postures of the homeless. You can walk along with your hands behind your back and your body hunched over. Naturally, there are mostly bare-chested black men in this. You cannot see the delicate sleeping posture of a young lady of sixteen or eighteen. However, even the sleeping posture of the black man can satisfy my eyes - please look at the style of looking up at the sky, the style of observing the geography, the shape of a curved earthworm, and the shape of a toad. They secretly kept these in other seasons, but now they are openly exhibited for anyone to visit.

The shops in the French Concession close very early, leaving only a few dim sum shops and fruit shops still open. If you are a little thirsty, then spend three or four cents to buy a small golden melon to eat! You bite your claws and slowly stroll from Avenue Joffre to the quiet Avenue Petain. The wind is stronger and the scenery is more peaceful here. Perhaps from the windows of the high-rise buildings flashing blue lights, you can hear the mournful piano and singing of White Russian girls. This is the sad sound of exiles from foreign countries. If you are a lyrical poet, will your "spirits" still be opened?

If you keep running west along Avenue Joffre and stroll around Boulevard de Montigny, you may see some "miracles" that you don't usually see. However, on the one hand, it is too late, and the curfew is approaching. It is a bit of a damper to be caught in a big car for strolling the streets. On the other hand, walking too much makes your legs sore, which also violates the original purpose of strolling the streets. So it's better to just turn back and stroll around Rue du Yunnan.

The night on Avenue Joffre is quiet, but Rue du Yunnan is always so lively and noisy. Even after the curfew, there are still chartered cars constantly appearing on that narrow cobblestone road to take women out to cards. The hostels and brothels are overflowing with the sound of mahjong tiles and laughter. In the hidden corners of the alleys, there are old addicts lying down smoking opium, with wisps of green smoke and a flickering lamp. This is not a good place to stroll, but we have to recognize some of the dark side of Shanghai!

Women, window displays, the appearance of all living beings, natural scenery, all belong to you, and you may as well enjoy them as much as possible. But there is one thing. If you are a little tired of strolling, then don't force yourself anyway. You should hurry home to sleep, because tomorrow morning, you still have to go to the office to work on those formulas and the Arabic numbers of a few yuan, a few cents, and a few mills. (Meng)

### The Round Gate Ball Charity Match Opened Yesterday; Friendship and South China Drew; The Friendship Team and Patriotic Nanyang Defeated Tongren; The Scene Was Unprecedented and the Performance Was Exceptionally Wonderful

The Changyin Cup Round Gate Ball Charity Match, the income of which will be donated to the Shen Bao Scholarship Fund and the Xinwen Bao Loan Scholarship Fund, opened at the Guangxia Stadium yesterday afternoon at 5:30. The audience was extremely large and the competition was very exciting, making it an unprecedented event for round gate ball. First, Mr. Qiu Changyin

Officiated the Opening Kick-Off

Then the competition began. In the women's group, the "Friendship" team played against the "Patriotic" team. At the end of the first half, each team scored another goal, and the two teams tied with two goals each. In the second act, the Friendship team took the lead 3-1. South China worked hard and eventually caught up, tying the score with three goals each. In the five-minute overtime, neither side scored. Due to time constraints, the overtime could not be extended, and the two sides shook hands and made peace. In the final act, Nanyang easily defeated Tongren 3-1. The second match is scheduled to be held this Wednesday afternoon.

The Competition Begins

Friendship team's Huang Mingyuan jumped up and shot hard, scoring successfully. The Patriotic team was not to be outdone, and Lu Lianbao cleverly used a series of tricks, immediately returning the color. At this time, both sides had opportunities to score, but unfortunately failed to do so. In the renewed battle, Friendship team's Yan Weiwen saw injustice on the road and came to help, Huang Mingyuan took advantage of the situation to sneak in and shot with a cannonball-like force, returning with success. Patriotic team's Ming Jingzhong followed suit, and thus tied the score at 2-2. In the second act, South China's He Jingui obtained a good opportunity for a penalty kick and scored a goal. Friendship team's Lu Gu Sui

Showed His Skills

To pull back the lost ground. At the eight-minute mark, Yu Lu added the finishing touch, and Lu Dazhen did not want to be outdone, also scoring a goal. The Friendship team's arrogance was overwhelming, and in the first half, the Friendship team led 3-1. Choosing to change sides and fight again, Friendship team's goalkeeper Qin Bidao unfortunately injured his arm. South China took the opportunity to counterattack, and Zheng Jiabiao scored two consecutive goals, making the score 3-3. Seeing the situation was not good, the Friendship team quickly ordered a defense. Zhang Xianlun got the ball and attacked, and South China was caught off guard and lost a goal. Not long after, South China's Zheng Yingqi also pulled back a goal.

Overtime

For five minutes, neither side scored. In the final act, Nanyang's Han Longhai opened the scoring, and Fan Qingxian and Mei Tangdu also scored, giving Nanyang a clean win of three goals. Tongren attacked a hundred times but to no avail, and the first half ended hastily. In the second battle, Tongren finally broke the duck egg by Li Jiazhi. Nanyang won Tongren 3-1.

The finale will be the home team Qianghua playing against South China. South China is both sound and beautiful, and Qianghua has always been known as invincible. Although the nature is only a performance, due to the handicap, the interest in the competition will not be reduced due to the disparity in strength. Today's opening program is as follows:

Qiangxing —— Tongren (One) 5:00 PM Qunyi —— Nanhua (One) 6:00 PM Qianghua —— South China (Two) 7:00 PM

### The Stone from Other Hills Is Truly Like "Life Is Like Morning Dew"; How Quick the Change

——Enterprise Design and Enterprise Capital——Originally Written by Kenkichi Ishiyama

Chinese entrepreneurs have always regarded their companies as private property; the company's capital is based on their own investment capacity as the standard for increase or decrease. If their own capital is limited, then even if the company has the certainty of expanding its business, they are unwilling to increase capital. The situation has changed slightly now. Some company authorities often use the high market price of old stocks to release old stocks on the one hand and套进 new stocks on the other, so they can avoid affecting their equity due to capital increase. However, his understanding of the future of the enterprise and capital has not changed. This article by Kenkichi Ishiyama was written for Japanese entrepreneurs, but Chinese entrepreneurs can also deeply understand his words. (Editor)

It was only two or three years ago that Yoshisuke Aikawa of Manchuria Heavy Industries, Shingo Tsuda of Kanebo, Jun Noguchi of Japan Nitrogen, Tomorei Nakano of Japan Soda, Masatoshi Okouchi of Riken Japan, and Mr. Hiroaki Mori of Japan Electric Industry were all well-known in the Japanese industrial world. But what about now after two or three years? Mr. Mori died in depression due to poor experiences, Nakano withdrew from Japan Soda, and Okouchi also left Riken; three out of six are finished. In just one or two years, why did it change so quickly? It can be said that "life is like morning dew".

Some people criticize the failure of Mori, Nakano, and Okouchi for choosing enterprises too rashly and promoting them too quickly. Like Okouchi's enterprise, there are only houses and no machinery; so it opens today and closes tomorrow. Nakano has factories, but no raw materials; Mori is the same. So they all failed. This is their enterprise design error. But are the other three without errors? No. Take Jun Noguchi as an example: Noguchi's first enterprise location was Kyushu. His enterprise was based on hydroelectric power generation. Kyushu has no room for development; so he moved to northern Korea, where there is abundant water resources, which can be active. But he had the will but not the strength.

Noguchi's Efforts to Overcome Difficulties

Noguchi's base camp is Japan Nitrogen, which was founded very early. It was originally a poor company, but when it moved to Korea, it was very strong. Because when he started Korea Nitrogen, he did not recruit a share from the outside world. His estimate was wrong. He used most of the capital on fixed construction. The construction cost ratio was large, and the electricity cost was self-responsible; the electricity cost was high, and the manufacturing cost of ammonium sulfate was high. In addition, the power generation was less than estimated, and the factory equipment was surplus; this loss was also added to the cost, so the cost of ammonium sulfate was even more expensive. The cost is expensive, and the price of Korea Nitrogen is bad; the situation of Korea Nitrogen is bad, and Japan Nitrogen, which bears all the shares of Korea Nitrogen, naturally follows. Fortunately, the market price of ammonium sulfate has soared in recent years, and Noguchi has also used amazing courage to supplement hydropower, which has improved slightly.

The situation of Kanebo is similar to that of Korea Nitrogen. Kanebo changed greatly after being operated by Mr. Tsuda. Previously, it specialized in spinning. After Tsuda came to power, he expanded to Kanebo Industries. Kanebo had some savings in its wood body, but it still felt insufficient to enrich Kanebo. At this time, the textile industry in China was good. If Kanebo's financial resources were used to expand textile in China, the harvest would be good. But he poured his efforts into operating Kanebo; although he spent a lot of effort, the results were mediocre.

Theory of Separation of Capital and Management

Capital support has a great relationship with the success or failure of a business. The above two examples are enough to prove it. However, Dr. Okouchi of Riken has always advocated the theory of separation of capital and management. In his book "Production First Doctrine", he loudly stated: "If capital dominates management, the development of industrial countries has no hope." This is his angry words after suffering from capital constraints and management, and it is also a common problem of general entrepreneurs. Indeed, to run an enterprise, capital is necessary; and the source of capital is only shareholders and banks: if the stock market price does not rise above 蔡面, do not hope for the participation of shareholders; if the business is just starting, you must plan to pay dividends; it is naturally difficult to expand the business. Asking the bank, general banks do not care about industrial finance. Industrial finance must be long-term finance, but general banks only operate short-term finance. Before the Mori financial group died, the author asked him what the future direction of the business would be? At that time, he was in the golden age, and was the most popular of the six emerging financial groups; however, his reply was unexpected. He said, "I no longer have the courage in my career; the financial problems take up all my time and energy, and I still feel unable to cope."

Aikawa's Wonderful Method of Enterprise Finance

Yoshisuke Aikawa has put a lot of effort into finance. In the past four or five years, he has concentrated his efforts on finance. He was originally the Japan Industry official. Japan Industry was not allowed in this country, so he went to Manchuria to operate heavy industry. However, Manchuria has no capital, and the capital must be brought from Japan. How did he obtain capital from Japan? The method is extremely bleak. On the one hand, he moved Japan Industry to Manchuria and renamed it Manchuria Heavy Industry Development Co., Ltd., and on the other hand, he sold the stocks held by the old Japan Industry. Fearing that the stock market could not afford the stimulus of selling, he left the market and sold it to specific people. He launched an investment certificate company, with insurance companies as shareholders. Shareholders have no management rights and can only enjoy dividends. And the Manchurian authorities guaranteed dividends of five points. The investment of insurance companies is for the purpose of殖利, and they have no management ambition. This is one of the reasons why he chose insurance companies to be毁东. More than a year after the establishment of the securities company, the old Japan Industry's holdings were completely transferred; Aikawa obtained a stock transfer profit of 70 million yuan. He relied on this fund to ensure dividends of eight points for the next six years without worry.

Dr. Okouchi's Ideal

Dr. Okouchi has always advocated science first, technology second, and capital third. Like general entrepreneurs, he does not do financial work. He believes that if the business plan is good, there is no worry that capital will not come. However, this kind of self-esteem has times when it works and times when it doesn't. For example, when Noguchi planned to supplement hydropower, he was strongly opposed by a certain財閥 who backed him. Noguchi, relying on his self-confidence, did not hesitate to sever ties with this財閥. His initial business estimate was already wrong. At this time, he also gave up the capital backing; such a decisive action was obviously ten times dangerous. But he did this, and he succeeded; why? Because he still had Japan Nitrogen as his support. Okouchi did not have an existing business to support him, so his self-confidence was not easy to gain public trust; although he was expanding what was related to military needs, steelmaking, which was obviously the most current business. But everyone said he was messing around, and he was finally expelled from Riken (Diamond Magazine)

### The Danger of Leisure

— Wu Dai

Many people have the misconception that the more leisure, the better. In reality, too much leisure is not only not happiness, but can also cause endless harm. Therefore, what we should pursue is more work, not too much leisure.

According to Dr. Nash, a professor of education at New York University, work is a key factor in maintaining mental health. He said that ordinary people think everyone likes leisure, rest, relaxation, sleep, and being away from work, but that is not the case. He said, "What humans truly love is to use their full skills to do creative work, so that they can achieve success and taste the sweetness of success. Leisure, unless it is useful, often throws life into chaos. Therefore, people who seek leisure and end up with too much leisure often suffer from it.

"There are very few people in the world who overwork; most people eat too much, worry too much, drink too much, and many people seek entertainment aimlessly. Their way of using leisure is to blindly imitate others or be controlled by others. Few people know that true happiness comes from work and the victory of life. Happiness and interest are the foundation of mental health.

"In the hands of those who don't know how to use it, leisure becomes a dangerous thing. Only a person with profound knowledge knows how to fully enjoy the pleasures of leisure. In short, leisure can become a trap for fools; and work, if it is suitable work, will not cause either the foolish or the wise to degenerate."

The leisure class, who are idle and do nothing all day long, should use their brains.

### Consoling My Son

— Li Fan

Child, are you resenting your situation again because of some unsatisfactory things? It must be the dazzling enjoyment that has stirred up a kind of dissatisfied resentment: Little Li bought a bicycle, which is very convenient to travel around; the director's new Shetland sweater is chic and stylish; that classmate who is a yarn factory employee is getting so many dividends; and your cousin has become a celebrity. Just hearing their names makes people envious.... Yes, child! Your father can't accumulate a lot of wealth to let you squander it like a young master. Your profession doesn't have an appealing title; after deducting food and lodging from your salary, the extra money each month isn't enough to buy a pair of leather shoes; when you compare yourself to your companions around you, you always feel that their situation is much better than ours.

But, child! That day, I saw your classmate frowning and worrying that the flying fluff in the factory would shorten his lifespan; the director probably tailored that new suit to avoid embarrassment at a grand banquet; do you think Little Li is happy riding his bicycle? Repairing the bike, paying for a license, not understanding traffic rules and getting fined – there are so many troubles. If his home wasn't so far away, he wouldn't cautiously ride his "freedom vehicle," would he?

Child! Your father is saying these things not to have you use abnormal psychology to relieve these feelings of envy and jealousy, nor to have you give up "desire and view everything with indifference." However, for every enjoyment, child, you can't just look at the perfect result. Beauty and extravagance are just one side; you see your cousin's smiling face on the screen, and many people are as envious of that smile as you are, but hasn't your cousin complained to you many times about living under the bright lights all night? Directors often use a sketching technique to put a part of life on the screen; we can't use it to observe satisfaction and disappointment, let alone use it to determine career choices!

Child! Why don't you try wearing that white serge suit you made last year and walk down the street? Won't many people cast envious glances at you? Won't many pretty girls give you flirtatious looks? Child, do you think they are too stupid?

### Sea Vessel

— Translated by Lin Bao, Illustrated by Lu Guang

The breeze blows on the sea vessel, one drifting west, one floating east; what makes them part ways is the sail, not the wind. In life's journey, fate is like the sea breeze; what determines the goal is not the dangers of the world, but the strength of willpower. — Original by Wilhelms

### Fatherly Love

— Wan Qian

From people's conversations and general writing, we can often hear or see the greatness of "motherly love," while at the same time, the words "fatherly love" are very unfamiliar to us, as if fathers in the world have no love at all.

But that is not the case. Simply because fathers are driven by life and mostly have to struggle in society, they spend less time at home caressing their children. Therefore, on the surface, almost every child feels that only their mother loves them. In fact, the energy and effort that fathers put into educating their children is no less than that of mothers!

In Qin Shouou's novel "Qiu Haitang," the depiction of "fatherly love" is exceptionally profound. After reading the tenth section, "The Heart of a Loving Father," and the fourteenth section, "The Life of a Hero," I was truly moved to tears and made me think that "fatherly love" is indeed as great as "motherly love." We should certainly keep in mind the nurturing grace of our mothers, but as children, we should not forget our fathers' protection and cultivation of us! (Editor's note: Qin Shouou's "Qiu Haitang" is published as a single volume by Jin Fen Tu Hua Company at No. 51, Lane 5, Jiangxi Road)

### The Weaver Girl of the Milky Way

— Lü Huanxiang

(Two-Part Collaborative Work)

After we enter the factory, our only hope is that the machines won't malfunction today, so that the work can proceed smoothly, with more production and less effort; but the reality is always contrary to our wishes. The machines seem to be deliberately teasing us. The shuttle, carrying silk threads and weaving east and west like a wandering oriole, is suddenly stuck in the middle. When this happens, it's a disaster! Thousands upon thousands of silk threads are cut like Mencius' mother cutting the fabric. We unlucky ones are undeniably responsible. Thousands and thousands of silkworm couples who have been separated must be reconnected by us pair by pair. Fortunately, we are patient, bending over, widening our eyes, running from the front of the machine to the back. After our hard work and mediation, thousands of divorced couples can continue their mirrored reunion. But it's hard on us. This kind of work is strenuous and unrewarding. Our compensation is calculated by length, and we can't ask the factory owner for half a penny for non-productive work.

Sometimes, because the raw materials are sized and easily break, they simply become chaotic later on, with tangled threads and vines, and no one is willing to keep order; but we must complete our silks and brocades, and we cannot allow them to be so disordered. We must supervise them to enter their respective loops in an orderly and individual manner, so we have to put in some effort to organize them. At this time, it's hard to cut and even harder to sort, which makes people hate and worry!

Our work is intense and collaborative. First, the technicians and supervisors design the fabric's structure, patterns, mechanical devices, and finished product dyeing, and then, according to the work procedure, direct the work of various personnel. "Designers" constantly draw fresh patterns, and "pattern makers" stamp the verified patterns onto the pattern plates. Technicians install the pattern plates on the Jacquard machine, and the weavers are responsible for organizing the warp and weft threads: as a result of this hard work, we can obtain fabrics that are exactly the same as our ideals.

As for the raw materials entering the factory, being able to put them on the loom means they have already gone through many parts of the work, including the winding department, the sizing department, the twisting department, the twisting department, the warping department, and the winding department; no part of the work is lacking. The woven fabric is still raw, and depending on the type of fabric, it needs to go through finishing, singeing, velvet cutting, stain removal, finishing, dyeing, and other work to see the flower-like and embroidered, colorful and eye-catching silks, gauzes, ramies, silk fabrics, crepes, woolens, flannels, serges, and georgettes as thin as cicada wings, satin that shines like gems, and thousands of bolts going out of the factory. The names of the fabrics are endless; the best is always a set composed of warp and weft. Some are displayed in company windows, some are draped over the bodies of compatriots, and some are loaded onto ships and transported abroad. Often when I am on the road and see a modern compatriot whom I don't know wearing a beautiful dress that dazzles people, and it is my product, I truly feel several times more proud and smug than that compatriot.

### Sharing a Boat in Storms

— He Jia Zhi

(7) Thunderbolt

After dinner, Wei Cheng asked Madam Ye Er, "Are the schools on winter break now?" Madam Ye Er said, "It's only the eleventh lunar month, so there can't be a holiday. You're studying at school, how can you ask me upside down?" Wei Cheng said, "The difference between the lunar and solar calendars is large this year. According to the solar calendar, it's already the end of December, and secondary schools take holidays early. I think some schools are in the habit of taking holidays early, so they should be on holiday." Madam Ye Yi said, "Wei Cheng, what do you mean by asking this?" Wei Cheng said, "I want to write a letter to the Chen siblings to ask if they are already on vacation." Madam Ye Er said, "What else are you talking about?" Wei Cheng said, "I'm not talking about anything else." Madam Ye Er said, "You can't tell those things that you've been keeping to yourself for the past two days to those siblings. Master Chen and Miss Chen are good people. You can be friends, and you can study poetry and prose together, but you can't..." Wei Cheng said, "Aunt has instructed me. This is the second time. I know."

After these words were spoken, Cui Zhen walked past Wei Cheng's bedroom and reported to Madam Ye Er, saying, "I heard Brother Cheng making a 'shshsh' sound in the room, as if he was tearing something." Madam Ye Er asked, guessing that he was tearing something, and Cui Zhen said, "It sounds like he's tearing letter paper made of foreign paper." Madam Ye Er said, "Maybe it's the letter he wrote to the Chen siblings, and he tore it up after I told him." Cui Zhen put her hand to her mouth, breathed a mouthful of hot air, and tucked it into the long sleeve of her cotton cheongsam, saying, "Yes, maybe. Recently, Miss Chen hasn't sent a letter in a long time either." In the countryside in winter, everyone sleeps very early, and the Ye family is no exception. Madam Ye Er slept late. The next morning, when she woke up, Cui Zhen called from outside the room: "Second Aunt, get up! Brother Cheng and Ah Xing were not at home last night. Today, He Zixing went to open the gate and saw that the gate was ajar." Cui Zhen still used a leisurely attitude to explain this unusual thing, which, when heard in Madam Ye Er's ears, was like taking away her heart. She got out of bed and didn't have time to put on her shoes, dragging her shoes backwards as she walked out, asking in a string: "What? What? How did Wei Cheng leave? Where did he go? Did Ah Xing leave too? Ah, the snow outside hasn't stopped, how can he walk outside? Isn't he in the inner room of the Shuangmei Study?" (150)

### Metal Mesh Gloves

— Yong Yun

Workers in dangerous occupations wear safety gloves made of metal mesh to prevent their fingers from being cut, glass from cutting their skin, etc. These gloves are softer than leather gloves and can be used at will without any hindrance. Because workers have safe confidence, the effect of their work is greatly increased.
