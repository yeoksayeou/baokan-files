### Uruguayan President Announces Dissolution of Parliament; Cabinet Held Important Meeting Yesterday; Resignation of Defense Minister Roletti Approved

Montevideo, Uruguay, 21st, Havas - President Baldomir issued an order today dissolving the House of Representatives. The meeting hall is temporarily guarded by troops. The President also scheduled a speech at 9:00 PM to explain the reasons for dissolving the House of Representatives. In addition, several cabinet members have submitted their resignations, but except for Defense Minister General Roletti, who resigned due to illness and was approved, the others were rejected. The country is as peaceful as usual.

Montevideo, Uruguay, 22nd, Havas - The cabinet is scheduled to hold a meeting tonight, at which important decisions will be made. According to the President, the cabinet may be reorganized if necessary, and a strong policy will be implemented thereafter. Fuel stored in the port is vulnerable to aerial bombardment, and measures are being taken to protect it.

Montevideo, Uruguay, 21st, Reuters - President Baldomir dissolved Parliament and announced the postponement of the general election scheduled for March 3rd. He will request parties friendly to the government to form a government committee to exercise legislative powers. Parliament has been closed and the keys are in the hands of the police. So far, the authorities have not ordered any arrests. According to Interior Minister Tiscornia, the military did not participate in today's political changes.

Buenos Aires, Argentina, 22nd, Haitong News Agency - The President of Uruguay delivered a radio address last night, strongly criticizing the National Party for opposing the granting of bases to the United States. He stated, "As President Roosevelt said, the Americas are in a time of threatened crisis. Therefore, if the National Party opposes the government, it actually wants to put the country in danger." He also said that the National Party's attempt to alienate Uruguay from the United States is a "crime" against the nation. The country is currently facing political and economic difficulties, so the people should unite and support the government.

Buenos Aires, Argentina, 22nd, Haitong News Agency - According to news from Montevideo, Uruguay, the political turmoil in Uruguay was caused by disputes between government party members and National opposition party members in parliament. The statement issued by the Minister of Interior not only defended the government but also attacked the party. It is reported that the leader of the National Party of Uruguay is Herrera. It is said that the government has repeatedly tried to amend the election law to weaken the party's power. As a result, the National Party criticized the government for manipulating the elections. At that time, the dispute between the two sides was very intense. The Minister of Interior even accused the National Party's parliamentarians of being agitators. Therefore, the people believed that parliament must first express its approval of the constitutional reform plan proposed by the President before elections could be held. However, parliament then passed a resolution disapproving of the government's policy and demanding that elections be held within the constitutional timeframe. The President then ordered the occupation of the parliament and election hall, causing turmoil. Several parliamentarians were injured, and the National Party secretary and one parliamentarian were arrested. The parliamentarians then held a meeting in front of the parliament building, jointly signing a document demanding non-recognition of President Baldomir's authority and stating that they could only recognize Vice President Chelos. Subsequently, all cabinet members also submitted their resignations, but they were rejected by the President.

It is equipped with eight 14-inch guns, twenty large and small anti-aircraft guns, thirty-two machine guns, and four aircraft.

### US Government Bids Farewell to Protecting Western Hemisphere Shipping Lanes; Emergency Measures to be Taken; Brazil Prepares to Arm Merchant Ships

Washington, 21st, Havas - Undersecretary of State Welles recently told the press that the US government authorities will take emergency measures to protect Western Hemisphere shipping routes. The Inter-American Defense Board is currently studying appropriate measures to protect the merchant ships of South American countries. As for the fact that two Brazilian merchant ships were hit by torpedoes fired by Axis submarines, we have implemented escorting. This is one of the ways in which the Americas are cooperating in joint defense, and other practical measures will soon be taken.

Washington, 21st, Havas - Regarding the sinking of the two Brazilian merchant ships "Bucare" and "Olinda" by Axis submarines off the American coast in the Atlantic, according to news from the Brazilian capital, the Brazilian government has lodged a strong protest with the German government, and the cabinet held a cabinet meeting yesterday to discuss the measures to be taken if Germany fails to provide a satisfactory response.

Buenos Aires, Argentina, 22nd, Haitong News Agency - The Brazilian government has decided that all merchant ships will be armed. Brazil's largest merchant ship, the "Mandu" (6,588 tons), is currently being repainted dark gray. According to the Brazilian merchant fleet, an escort fleet will soon be organized.

US Oil Tanker Sunk

Washington, 22nd, Reuters - The Navy Department announced that the US oil tanker "Pennsylvania" (8,200 tons) was sunk by a torpedo from a submarine in the Atlantic. Eighteen sailors were rescued, and twenty died from burns caused by oil fires. This is the thirty-first American ship sunk in the Atlantic.

Willemstad, Curacao, Dutch West Indies, 21st, Havas - The Norwegian oil tanker "Kongsdal" (9,467 tons) was hit by a torpedo this morning in the waters off this island and has now been towed to this port.

Berlin, 22nd, Haitong News Agency - Yesterday's German war report stated that German submarines sank seventeen merchant ships off the American coast, totaling 100,002 tons. Therefore, since the United States entered the war, the number of ships sunk off the American coast has reached eighty, totaling 532,900 tons. The waters off Port of Spain, the capital of Trinidad, are also an area of ‚Äã‚ÄãGerman submarine activity. German submarines penetrated into Paria Bay and sank two enemy ships, including one oil tanker. Trinidad is a naval and air base. When the United States and Britain concluded the agreement for the United States to transfer sixty destroyers to Britain, it was also stipulated that the island would be built as a base. Because the island is of great military importance, it is a barrier to the Panama Canal and is located on the shipping route from the United States to Africa. Now that German submarines have sunk ships in the waters off Port of Spain, this is an incident that has damaged the prestige of Britain and the United States.

### Large Quantities of Gold Transported from Africa to Germany

Washington, 21st - The US government has learned that large quantities of cash are being transported by plane from North Africa to Europe, with Germany as the final destination. It is reported that the plane flies from Algiers to Marseille, and then transits from Marseille. The above-mentioned cash is said to belong to the Belgian government.

### Wavell on Generalship (4)

Finally, I want to talk about the complexities of modern military affairs. I don't know if you have ever noticed this. Today's commanders must not only meet the usual qualifications, but also be proficient in how to use the air force, armored vehicles, and anti-aircraft guns; how to use poison gas and smoke screens when attacking or defending; how to use radio to communicate messages; how to use camouflage and propaganda techniques; and how to follow the development of military engineering so that they are not left behind. The situation on the battlefield has of course also completely changed. In the Battle of Blenheim, Marlborough personally deployed the artillery positions and rode along the line. After inspecting the whole line, he had lunch in the afternoon in the midst of the gunfire, waiting for news of the allied forces four miles away on the right wing. At that time, four miles was considered a very long distance. Napoleon at Austerlitz was able to see with his own eyes the weakness and incompetence of the enemy army, making it difficult to resist the counterattack that the French army was preparing. Then, he immediately decided on the best time to attack. Wellington witnessed his powerful enemy's misallocation of resources in front of the Sarapega front, and was able to turn around with confidence and say to the Spanish representative, "My dear Alava, this fellow is finished this time!" Just sixty years later, at Sedan, Moltke and his emperor were still able to watch the defeat of the French army on a nearby hilltop, with almost the entire line in sight. By the time of the last war, even the battalion commander who had ordered the reserves to join the battle could not see the front line as clearly as described above. As for the commander-in-chief, he was no longer on the battlefield, but sat in an office several miles behind or wandered anxiously in the flower garden of the villa, waiting for the delayed battle report from the front, and even if the battle report arrived, it was often still unreliable.

That was the situation in the past, what about the future? Many new forces will be used on land and in the air, and most of their capabilities have not yet been discovered. Some of them were partially utilized in the last war, but have been greatly improved and expanded after the war; some have only recently seen progress; and some have not been tested at all. Imaginative commanders - in fact, geniuses - who can make good use of these new forces can leave their names in history and join the ranks of "famous generals". But this title is not easily attainable; see what qualifications are required. The speed and distance of modern land forces are now greater than those of the most mobile cavalry in the past. Therefore, the person who leads them must not only be familiar with cavalry tactics, but also understand naval strategy and tactics. The position of generals on the modern battlefield and the situation where decisions must be made without hesitation can be seen to some extent from the Battle of Jutland; the battles of Salisbury Plain or the Great Valley cannot be compared. It goes without saying that one must be equally adept at the use of the air force.

As for whether the commander should be an army general who is familiar with air combat or an air force general who is familiar with land combat, I don't think it matters. In future wars, both must be combined to defeat the enemy. In addition, the commander's learning must be rich in common sense and understanding of human nature. The practice of all wars is ultimately built on these qualities, not on machines. I will elaborate on this next time.

Last time I briefly discussed the nature and duties of generals; this can be said to be a question of the general himself. Now let us look at the relationship between the general and his subordinates. Generals must rely on staff officers to command their subordinates, so I will start with the staff. I believe that every general should abide by two simple rules: first, never do the work of a staff officer himself; second, never let a staff officer isolate himself from his subordinates. Staff officers most want the general to give clear and precise instructions and let them plan the details without interference. Subordinates and junior commanders most want the general to be able to contact them personally often, and should not have everything go through the staff officer's ears. The less time a general spends in the office and the more time he spends in contact with his subordinates, the better.

During the last war, I served under Allenby and Chetwode and felt that the two generals were very ideal in this regard. I think most British generals are like this, but there are also exceptions. For example, Maude, who captured Baghdad, liked to concentrate all staff and command work in his own hands; Allenby's predecessor in Palestine, Murray, did not communicate with his subordinates.

Some of you may also know that there is a peculiar staff system in the German army, that is, under the commander, there is another group of senior officers from the General Staff who also hold great discretionary power, and their ranks are often very low. You must all remember the story of Lieutenant Colonel Hentsch in the Battle of the Marne, whose mission at the time had a major impact on the entire war situation. Another example is the cooperation between Hindenburg and Ludendorff, where Ludendorff was in effect both chief of staff and commander, and Hindenburg was just a puppet. This system is incompatible with the British Army and will naturally not be adopted. Russia will follow suit, and strange phenomena will occur from time to time. For example, during the war, the commander of a certain army group was the veteran Ivanov, while his chief of staff, Alexeyev, was a very scientific officer. Both believed that they had the right to be the first to read the telegrams sent by the General Staff and refused to give way to each other. As a result, all telegrams had to be copied into two copies, one for the chief of staff and one for the commander; often they did not consult with each other and went their own way.

Speaking of the way of commanding generals, a commander must first know the character of each person, how to restrain those who need to be restrained and urge those who need to be urged, and who can be entrusted with the important task of being alone and who must be supervised at all times. Some subordinates need to be given detailed and thoughtful orders, and some only need to be given rough guidelines. There are many generals who are excellent commanders under the command of a superior, but when they are ordered to command alone, they immediately appear inferior, and sometimes even panic. Conversely, there are also those who are difficult to command but can be allowed to act on their own. These two types of people must not be confused; that is to say, the commander must be good at judging people. Let us look at the measures taken by Napoleon and Wellington in this regard. Few of Napoleon's subordinates could gain his trust and command independently - Davout, Mass√©na, and Marmont were the main exceptions. Wellington completely trusted Graham and often charged him with acting alone, but he was unwilling to give Craufurd, Beresford, or Picton great freedom, because Craufurd was considered capable but also reckless, and the other two were less capable.

Now it is time to talk about the relationship between generals and subordinates. I think you can see that this is a big topic and it is difficult to draw conclusions immediately. The way we look at officers at all levels is naturally different from the way we look at soldiers, and the armies of different countries must be treated separately. The French call their subordinates "my brave men" and mention glory and the motherland. British people, when gathering troops for a speech, call them "soldiers"; the Soviets call them "comrades"; the German commander may in the future shout "Aryan comrades" to arouse the self-esteem of the officers and soldiers. But regardless of nationality, regardless of the environment, the fundamental question remains unchanged: what kind of guidance will make soldiers willing to risk their lives, and what responsibilities must generals bear to cultivate the soldiers' ability to endure? Who does not want to live and fear death; what exactly is it that makes soldiers willing to give their lives? Perhaps it is spoils of war or glory, perhaps it is discipline and tradition, perhaps it is belief in ideology and country, perhaps it is belief in the leader.

### Portuguese Prime Minister Issues Report on the Timor Incident, Saying Protest Has Been Lodged

Lisbon, Portugal, 21st, Havas - Regarding the landing of Japanese troops on Portuguese Timor, Prime Minister Salazar submitted a detailed report to the National Assembly today. Afterwards, the National Assembly unanimously passed a resolution strongly protesting this action and requesting the government to "take all appropriate measures to ensure that all countries respect Portuguese sovereignty and territorial integrity."

Lisbon, Portugal, 21st, Havas - Prime Minister Salazar gave a speech in the National Assembly today, stating that the Japanese government had submitted a note to our country clearly recognizing our country's sovereignty over Timor Island. After Dutch and British troops occupied the island previously, we believed that the best way to restore the original state was to increase our country's garrison on the island. We negotiated with Britain, and the British attitude was very frank. Unfortunately, our troops did not arrive in time. On the 19th of this month, the Japanese ambassador first went to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in person at 6:00 PM to notify us verbally, and then submitted a written document at 10:30 PM in the evening, stating that Japanese troops had occupied Timor Island and informing us that this action was purely for military reasons. At the same time, he declared that he fully recognized our country's sovereignty over the Portuguese part of the island, but this document does not reduce the severity of the situation. Therefore, our country has protested to the Japanese government.

Lisbon, Portugal, 21st, Havas - The Portuguese troop transport ship "Joao Bello," carrying a batch of soldiers from the country to Portuguese Timor to reinforce its defenses, and thereby demonstrate that the eastern part of the island, although occupied by British and Dutch forces, does not prejudice Portuguese sovereignty, has been sailing for many days since its departure. It has been learned that the ship sailed east from Ceylon today. Prime Minister Salazar referred to this ship when he reported the island incident to the National Assembly today.

### Britain to Change Indian Policy

Stockholm, 22nd - Domei News Agency - According to London sources, British political figures expect a further cabinet reshuffle, as important meetings are held in London almost daily. It is widely rumored in London that the Secretary of State for India and Burma, Leo Amery, and several other cabinet members will be replaced by younger figures. Churchill met with Amery yesterday, and political figures believe that Britain's Indian policy is about to change, but the extent of the concessions is yet to be determined. It is unlikely that Churchill will completely change his attitude towards India, but will only make slight concessions. It is said that Sir Stafford Cripps participated in the war cabinet on the condition of changing the attitude towards India, and his influence has already begun to take effect.

### Indian Air Defense Measures

[Location missing in original text], 22nd - Domei News Agency - According to sources received here, Indian authorities are quite concerned about Japanese air raids.

### Nehru's Statement

Bangkok, 22nd - Domei News Agency - A dispatch from Calcutta states that Indian nationalist leader Nehru declared that if Britain indicates acceptance of India's demands for freedom, then we are willing to cooperate with Britain to defend the country. If Britain had heeded India's demands at the beginning of the war, the situation in India would be different today. Nehru expressed considerable doubt as to whether the British cabinet would fulfill India's demands, and therefore does not believe that such an agreement can be reached in the short term.

### Germany Begins Recruiting Motorized Infantry

Berlin, 22nd - Havas News Agency - The Army Department today began recruiting volunteers for motorized infantry units, mechanized units, and intelligence units.

### Snippets

Bali, also known as "The Island of Poetry" and "The Island of a Thousand Temples," is one of the Lesser Sunda Islands in the Dutch East Indies. Its customs and habits still retain the traditions of a thousand years ago, such as women baring their breasts, cremation after death, wood carving and dancing, the use of Chinese square-holed coins, male supremacy, and cockfighting, all of which are different from other islands in the Dutch East Indies. Therefore, foreign tourists visiting the Dutch East Indies invariably flock to Bali. The temples here, although numerous, are not very magnificent. The high towers are all made of palm leaves and bamboo. (See above picture) Bali's dances are extremely famous in the world. The most popular new dance, such as the Djager dance, is not bound by traditional customs and is interspersed with jokes, which is quite popular with tourists. (See below picture) Today, this small island is filled with the smell of gunpowder. Geographically speaking, it is close to Surabaya, and the Dutch East Indies is also feeling threatened.

### Smooth Passage Through the Year-End Accounting Period: Outlook for Commerce in this City; Prices of Uncontrolled Goods Expected to Rise

The well-known economist Mr. Annan published an article in the English-language "North China Daily News" yesterday, discussing the recent economic situation in this city. Excerpts are translated below:

Smooth Passage Through the Year-End Accounting Period

The Shanghai business community has now safely passed through the year-end accounting period of the old lunar year, with very few closures. Although some businesses suffered severe losses during the Pacific War, they had previously made substantial profits, so most were not shaken. Many businesses were on the verge of collapse a month ago, but were spared by the partial opening of warehouses and the soaring prices of various goods. The closures of some Chinese enterprises in the past week were not due to bankruptcy, but were of a normal liquidation nature, as they could no longer enjoy the same high profits as before under the new circumstances.

Prices Rise Continuously in the Past Few Days

Those who generally expected prices to fall after the Lunar New Year were greatly disappointed. The retail prices of various goods, except for a few necessities controlled by the authorities, have continued to rise in the past three or four days. Anyone returning home from shopping at stores or markets inevitably brings back new news of price increases. The cost of living for both Westerners and Chinese has clearly increased, and at a very rapid pace.

Eagerness to Purchase Uncontrolled Goods

After the Lunar New Year, the prices of various commercial goods continue to be firm, and most business people still expect them to rise again. The trend in transactions has clearly shifted to the purchase of goods that are not subject to control. Half a month ago, those who held inventory in the then-sealed warehouses were almost willing to sell their warehouse receipts at any price, but today, those whose inventory can be freely withdrawn are not selling them. Some people are even not only not selling, but want to buy, because cash may depreciate, while commodities may appreciate.

### Gambling Den in Butcher Shop; License Revoked

Detectives from the French Concession Police Headquarters learned that there was a secret gambling den operating in the Zhuang Yuanmao butcher shop at No. 7 Xinxin Street on Rue Cardinal Fesch. They secretly raided the premises at around 3:00 PM the day before yesterday and confiscated gambling equipment and money in a room on the third floor. Fourteen male and female gamblers were arrested and taken to the police station. As a result, the gamblers were each fined 20 yuan as a warning. The butcher shop's license was revoked because it was found to be operating a gambling den.

The Commissioner of Police of the French Concession, considering that it is customary for Shanghai residents to gamble in hotels during the Lunar New Year, which is not only a waste of money but also a violation of police regulations, specially ordered detectives and gambling squads from all police stations under his jurisdiction to strictly investigate and prohibit such activities and not to slacken their efforts. Therefore, detectives have been entering hotels late at night to inspect the rooms in order to eliminate gambling and maintain social stability.

### New Postal Route for Mail Sent Abroad

The Shanghai Postal Bureau has been actively seeking ways to facilitate the dispatch of various types of mail, both light and heavy, from Shanghai to foreign countries. However, due to the failure to promptly restore water and land transportation and the ongoing wars in various places, the delivery of letters has inevitably encountered difficulties. It has been learned from the Postal Bureau that it is searching for new postal routes for mail sent from Shanghai to foreign countries, with the aim of ensuring speed and avoiding any loss. However, whether the method of delivering various letters by foreign residents in Shanghai will change, the Postal Bureau will issue another notice in due course. As for large and small parcels sent abroad, the Postal Bureau is currently suspending their acceptance. However, the Bureau has resumed accepting parcels sent to French Indochina, but the sender must bear the responsibility for any delays due to the lack of ships, and the Postal Bureau will not be responsible.

### Reminder to Collect Scholarship Funds; Deadline at the End of February; Overdue Applications Will Be Invalidated

The list of those approved for the scholarship funds for newspaper readers has been published in its entirety for many days. There are still some students who have not collected their checks. In addition to sending them separate letters of notification to their addresses, we are issuing another public notice that these scholarship checks must be collected at our office before the end of this month. Applications that are overdue will be invalidated without exception, and no exceptions will be made. We also hope that students whose applications have not been approved will collect the previously submitted supporting documents as soon as possible to clear the procedures. If you have any inquiries, please be sure to include your registration certificate number and attach a self-addressed stamped envelope, otherwise, we will not respond. You must also bring your registration certificate if you come in person. We hope everyone will pay attention.

### Milk Supplies Require a Doctor's Certificate; Declaration Required Stating No Stock at Home; Notice to Residents from the French Concession Authorities

The French Concession issued a notice stating, "For the purpose of notification, the French authorities, recognizing that canned milk is an indispensable food for patients and children, have decided to purchase all stored canned milk within the concession in order to maintain a permanent supply of this food. The Health Office at 630 Rue de Baron Louis will be responsible for the distribution of milk. Residents within the concession can apply to the office for a weekly supply of milk, but applicants must provide a certificate issued by a registered doctor proving the quantity absolutely needed by the patient or that the child needs milk as a necessary food. In addition to the certificate, applicants must also sign a "Household Declaration" stating that there is no milk stock at home, before the Health Office can issue a "Delivery Order" allowing them to collect the milk they need. The Health Office and the Police Department may conduct inspections at any time, and those who make false statements will be punished without leniency. As for the dates for collecting milk with the order, the Health Office at 630 Rue de Baron Louis will be open every afternoon except on holidays. This is a urgent notice.

### Factory and Labor Survey; Collection of Forms Tomorrow; Carried out Simultaneously in Both Concessions; Forms Must Be Filled Out in Detail

The factory and labor survey in the International Settlement began on the 20th of this month. The factories surveyed are limited to those not under the control of the Japanese authorities and employing 30 or more workers. However, those located within the International Settlement, whether north or south of the Suzhou Creek, must be surveyed. Two types of forms have been printed for this survey, one for factory information and one for labor information. The factory form requires information on the types and quantities of goods produced and raw materials used, as well as the machinery and power used. The information must be filled out in detail. It is reported that the results of this survey will be submitted by the Municipal Council to the Shanghai office of the Japanese Asia Development Board. It is apparent that the Japanese side intends to thoroughly understand the industrial situation in this city and plans to use the survey results to learn about the needs of various factories in terms of raw materials, fuel, and labor, as well as their possible contribution to the Japanese war effort. However, according to business leaders in this city, they hope that the results of this survey can also be published to the business community, as they are eager to obtain this information and use it to plan their future business operations. In addition, the French Concession is also conducting a survey of a similar nature at the same time. The survey work in both concessions is being carried out entirely by the Police Department. The International Settlement is scheduled to collect the issued survey forms tomorrow, so all factories should fill them out quickly to avoid delays.

### A Shanghai Impression from a Year Ago (II)

‚Äî Translated by Wu Yancun

As the ship continued upstream, the Shanghai Electric Power Company's power plant, much like the Oku power plant upstream on Tokyo's Sumida River, stood prominently before us. Almost all the electricity required by the Shanghai International Settlement was supplied by that power plant. The electric power company had a capital of 56 million yuan and bonds worth 88 million yuan, making it a large enterprise. Of this capital, 80% was owned by Americans, 10% by British, 3% by Japanese, and only a little over 6% by the Chinese, who were in the most advantageous position. The coal piled up on the riverbank was as high as a mountain. Before the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese conflict, most of the coal used by the plant was transported from the Kailuan coal mines in North China. It is a well-known fact that Kailuan was British capital.

The area near the Shanghai Electric Power Company is an industrial zone, with many factories visible. The three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui in Central China account for 50% to 60% of the total industrial output of China, with Shanghai alone accounting for 40% to 45%. The situation of Japanese, Chinese, and British yarn mills standing side by side could be observed from the ship. Originally, within the triangular area of Central China‚ÄîShanghai, Nanjing, and Hangzhou‚Äîthe total number of yarn spindles was approximately 3.28 million, of which 1.73 million were operated by Chinese capital. Of the remainder, Japan had 1.33 million spindles and Britain had 220,000 spindles. This, of course, was the statistic from the end of 1936. Since the war, a considerable number have been destroyed. However, with Shanghai as the center for reconstruction, some of the Chinese yarn mills were repaired and improved by the Japanese and operated by them, while others were still operated by the Chinese. By the end of 1939, the number of spindles in operation within that triangular area was 1.93 million on the Japanese side, 470,000 on the Chinese side, and 250,000 on the British side. There were a total of nine Japanese textile companies, with a total investment of approximately 222.1 million yuan, and the total investment in the British textile industry was approximately 29 million yuan.

Originally, China's heavy industry was not developed, and the enterprises that symbolized the development of Chinese capital were only light industries, with the textile industry being the standard light industry. The intensity of competition between Japanese and Chinese factories in this standard national industry of China can be easily understood by comparing the numbers of spindles listed above. This is the problem of the struggle between Japanese capital and the Chinese nation.

Leaving aside the issue of the nationality of capital for the moment, the textile industry in Central China, centered around Shanghai, also has an important factor related to the international economy, namely the issue of cotton as a textile raw material. According to the situation described above, approximately 2.65 million spindles were in operation within the triangular area of Central China. After the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese conflict, the domestic cotton in China could not fully supply Shanghai's needs, so the large-scale import of foreign cotton became inevitable. In 1939, Shanghai imported a total of 2.3 million metric quintals of cotton, with a value of approximately 9.61 million pounds in British currency. Where did so much cotton come from? Please see the following explanation:‚Äî‚Äî

Imports from British India: valued at 5.17 million pounds
Imports from Brazil: valued at 2.08 million pounds
Imports from the United States: valued at 1.599 million pounds
Imports from Egypt: valued at 480,000 pounds
Imports from other countries: valued at 270,000 pounds

The total value of these cotton imports was 9.61 million pounds, which, converted at the Shanghai black market exchange rate, was approximately 380 million legal tender yuan. In 1939, the total value of foreign goods imported into Shanghai was 35.58 million pounds, so the value of cotton imports accounted for a huge 27%. Such a large amount of imports certainly affected the balance of trade, and further, the devaluation of the legal tender on the Shanghai free market may also have been due to this reason. However, leaving this topic aside for the moment, comparing Shanghai's foreign cotton imports with the large-scale international cotton trade, the cotton exported from the United States to China accounted for only 6% of the total exports. That is the figure for the whole of China, and Shanghai's imports were certainly less than this number. Also, perhaps unexpectedly, the foreign capital invested in China was approximately 250 million US dollars, and the Chinese economy was greatly affected by this, but this amount of 350 million US dollars is only the total value of the assets of New York City.

Now, returning to the Huangpu River, the ship continued to move forward, getting closer and closer to the wharf. The wharves and warehouses of various countries along the river were closely arranged, showing an extremely complex situation. A port that serves as a country's gateway being divided among various countries of the world is probably a rare thing in the world, but it is very interesting to see! Ships from various countries were docked there, and small boats shuttled back and forth like shuttles. Particularly noteworthy were the merchant ships of warring nations, such as French and Italian ships, which could not return to Europe and had to remain tied up in the port of Shanghai. Such a unified yet ununified appearance is the great port of Shanghai, one of the few in the world.

In 1939, the number of foreign ships entering and leaving Shanghai was 7.61 million tons for imports and 7.39 million tons for exports, and 2.96 million tons for imports of coastal ships and 3.19 million tons for exports. It is important to note here the power of foreign ships in the domestic shipping industry. The most important countries can be seen by examining the ratio table of ship import and export tonnage of various ports in China in 1939. According to the numbers listed in the table below, the power of Britain and Japan is the strongest, and there are many other foreign ships sailing along the coast of China. Excluding scattered countries‚ÄîBritish ships account for approximately 37.03%

Japanese ships account for 30.35%

Norwegian ships account for 6.27%

Chinese ships (excluding sailing ships) account for 0.19%

German ships account for 4.10%

Dutch ships account for 3.49%

Chinese sailing ships account for 2.97%

## Page 4

Italian ships account for 2.18%

Danish ships account for 2.15%

French ships account for 2.5%

American ships account for 1.59%

Portuguese ships account for 0.59%

Swedish ships account for 0.59%

Foreign ships flying various flags in Chinese ports, along with various facilities such as warehouses, wharves, and land in various places, were also operated by foreigners. Among these, in Central China, according to national statistics, at the end of 1936, it was roughly as listed in the table below. Although it is said to be Central China, regarding the layer of ships, because it belongs to the nature of movement, it cannot be calculated separately, so all the ships sailing along the coast and inland rivers of China are included.

Japan: 58 million yuan

Britain: 182 million yuan

United States: 15 million yuan

France: 20 million yuan

Other countries only have a few. Relying on the shipping investment described above, local products from all over China are transported from various places in Central China and the hinterland of the Yangtze River to Shanghai, a central distribution point, and then distributed from Shanghai to various countries. Also, goods transported to Shanghai from all over the world can be transferred to the inland areas of Central China.

In the end, what commodities did the Central China region, centered on Shanghai, import from various countries in the world, and what commodities did it export to various countries in the world? The latest statistics can be used to represent the situation in the year before and after the outbreak of the Second European War. The imported goods in the second half of 1939 and the first half of 1940 were roughly as follows: (Unit: Customs Gold Unit)

Fuel: 14,245,981

Metals and metal products: 30,349,274

Chemical products: 35,579,977

Manufacturing products: 1,288,313

Fiber and textile products: 92,830,056
Other light industrial products: 18,164,166

Food: 44,349,565

Miscellaneous: 6,388,447

Total: 24,195,779

During the same period, Shanghai's export goods were roughly as follows:‚Äî‚Äî (Unit: Legal Tender Yuan)
Animal products: 190,214,094

Plant products: 140,849,828

Forest products: 9,976,114

Textile fibers: 251,034,284

Mineral products: 42,067,258

Industrial products: 422,608,185

Total: 1,065,739,863

The total value of imported goods is 243,195,779 gold units, which, according to the black market price of legal tender in 1939, is converted to an average of more than 240 million yuan. It seems that the amount of import surplus is about 140 million yuan.

After landing, if a traveler resides in the Broadway Mansions on the banks of the Suzhou Creek; looking down from the upper floors of the building, the heart of the international city of Shanghai can be seen at a glance. The area along the Huangpu River is the so-called "Bund"; the center of the metropolis is mostly magnificent bank buildings. (To be continued)

### Pedestrian Killed by Truck

At 8:20 AM the other day, an unidentified man, around 40 years old, was walking across Avenue Edward VII in front of house number 94, crossing the road from south to north, when a truck suddenly sped from east to west and was unable to avoid him, causing him to be knocked down and suffer a head injury. The truck turned around and drove away after the accident. The injured man was sent to the hospital by the police, but he died before he could be treated. The body was buried by a charitable organization yesterday, pending identification.

### The Chinese Morality Association Distributes Charity

The Chinese Morality Association on Tongfu Road has been distributing rice and meals recently, and is extremely busy. From morning till night, those who receive assistance are extremely crowded, almost blocking the road. The old and the young, all sing praises. The rice and meals are given out with vouchers, and the order is well maintained. The association handles things effectively, and the staff all regard it as their responsibility. It is said that in three days, about 100 stones of rice and meals were distributed. In these difficult times, the enthusiasm for charity is no less than in the past, which is truly commendable.

Yesterday's newspaper was broadcast at 6:15 PM

### "Full House" and Its Ah

‚Äî Chongzhang

Bored on New Year's Day, I wandered around the streets, admiring the street scenes, intending to take things as they came and find a place to pass the morning. Walking past a small movie theater, I saw the iron gate pulled tightly shut, knowing without asking that it was overcrowded. At the entrance of the first-run movie theater, a "Full House" sign stood prominently, simply blocking the way. The corridor was crowded with people, discussing with each other, "The second showing is also sold out, what should we do?" The problem seemed very serious, and it was difficult to resolve it urgently. From this point of view, Shanghai seems to still maintain the prosperity of a metropolis.

Someone went to the first-class dance hall after [missing word], because they were well-dressed, they were favored by the waiters, who thought he was an "old Shanghai hand," and took the opportunity to talk about recent events in the dance hall. It is said that now there are crowds of people and business is booming, but in fact their "commission" income has decreased sharply. The reason is that there are more "blue cloth gowns and scarf gangs," and the "King Wen Divine Calculation" is popular. With a cup of fragrant tea, they look around, forgetting their birthday and time. Before leaving, the "waiters" say goodbye repeatedly. In addition to the regular bill, a few small change are found on the table. The waiters also have old and young at home, and they also have their own grievances. The listener could only agree, embarrassed to sit any longer, because they had been caught in the act. However, from the perspective of the patrons, the dance hall business is not slow, still "fish swimming in a full pond," and "stalls stand like a forest."

A Qilin opera fan told me that there were many empty seats in the Golden Theater. I told him of the definite news from another Qilin opera fan that the Golden tickets had already been sold out. The empty seats were only because patrons were absent for some reason. It can be seen that the Beijing-style opera is full house, and the Shanghai-style opera is also full house. The price of tickets, whether expensive or fair, is not enough to affect it. The reason is that Shanghai people need entertainment. As for whether those who are entertained are truly qualified to be entertained, or whether their homes have rice and coal, that is another question, and it does not stand in opposition to the phenomenon of a full house.

Whether someone even spends their meal money at the ticket office is a mystery, because the taste of drama and the taste of puffer fish cannot be confused. The audience will not die for it, and prepare to tighten their belts. This mystery cannot be broken until the end of the road.

### Different Clothes

‚Äî Xinghua

At a wedding feast in a certain mansion, someone named Jia wore a blue cloth gown. The crowd discussed, saying, "Wearing a cloth gown to a wedding feast, how poor."

At the same time, someone named Yi, who owned a huge fortune, also wore cloth clothes that day. The crowd praised, saying, "Rich and frugal, such a wealthy person."

### The Music of "Yang Guifei"

‚Äî Baishi

This is not the first attempt to accompany a play with music, but this time the music accompaniment can be said to be relatively successful.

The story of "Yang Guifei" is known to everyone. The audience watching "Yang Guifei" already knows the progress and ending of the plot before watching the play. When watching the play, there is no need to work hard to follow the lines to find clues, and they can freely appreciate the beauty of light, sound, and movement. The first, second, third, fourth, and sixth acts are simply a few lyric poems, especially the scene of the Cowherd and Weaver Girl separated by the Milky Way, with half a moon shining on the Hall of Eternal Life. In this kind of setting, the effect of music is guaranteed.

The scene in the fifth act is one of war, chaos, and parting. It is quite difficult to compose music for this act. Music, as Wagner said, is not good at depicting ugly scenes. Mendelssohn wrote incidental music for A Midsummer Night's Dream, trying to capture the beautiful scenes and abandoning the rough and dangerous ones. This is his cleverness. The comparative lack of expressiveness of the music in the fifth act of "Yang Guifei" is due to a reason: In order to suit the mood of the ancient costume palace drama, the composer adopted Chinese-style tunes from the beginning, and many places also used the pentatonic scale. It is not easy to achieve results when this material is applied to a dramatic and tense moment. But on this point, we must understand the composer's intention: he must be unwilling to destroy the consistent atmosphere of the whole play - the ancient, fragrant, and smokey atmosphere. Another point worth mentioning is that the composer is very good at using the effects of Crescendo and Tremolo, which can be said to be the only way to achieve tension in Chinese-style tunes.

The insertion of Mr. Huang Bai's posthumous work "Mountains in the Vain Misty World" in the fourth and sixth acts, sung by a three-part female voice, adds a lot of color to the whole play. Many applause at each performance are for this song.

In short, although there are some flaws, the coordination between music and drama in color and atmosphere is just right, and both actors and audiences must have this feeling.

### Stage Curtain

When Bai Yun was called Yang Weihan, he was the newest to join the National Union Film Company, but problems arose after receiving the deposit. Later, Xu Xingzhi introduced him to the Guohua Film Company as the leading actor in "Rouge Zero". Until recently, Bai Yun's contract with Guohua was about to expire, and the National Union Film Company brought up the old matter again. The National Union Film Company also wanted to send him to the Hong Kong factory to co-star in "La Traviata" with Hu Die, but nothing was decided before December 8. And his contract with Guohua did not seem to have the possibility of continuation. Going to Qingdao this time may also be for the release of depression.

The unfinished play that Mei Xi was in at the National Union Film Company was "Happy New Year" co-starring with Chen Yunshang.

After Yao Li and Dong Ni successfully sang accompaniment for the high-ranking people in the Sinapore Hotel, Lido also invited Yang Liu to join. Yang Liu is an actor of the Yihua Film Company. No one ever knew that she could sing, but her new voice trial was quite good.

The "Drama" published by the Quxue Yekan Society, edited by Zhao Jingshen and Zhuang Yifu, is dedicated to the study of Chinese drama. It has now been published to the second collection. In addition to carrying drama theory and historical materials, the journal also publishes secret copies of battle music scores, such as Embroidery Robe Notes and Selling Horses, which are different from the current popular editions, and are truly the best publications for those who love to study music.

### Sharing the Same Boat Through Storms

‚Äî He Jiaji

A Branch of Spring Tea House was nearby. Weicheng walked in and sat opposite Zhang Shurong. The lights in the tea house were already on. Zhang Shurong took a sip of hot tea, twirled his gray beard, and smiled, "Young Master Ye, you don't know, people are afraid of being famous, and pigs are afraid of being fat. I put a red flag on the boat, and people call me Red Flag Zhang. In Huagang, those local ruffians, thinking I made a good deal, have been asking me for annual fees these past two days. The annual fees, Zhang Shurong took down the red flag, what would they do to me?" Weicheng said, "When will the boat leave? I know you leave from the Shanghai pier every Wednesday and Saturday. Today is Saturday." Zhang Shurong said, "Yes, today is Saturday. Young Master Ye, the boat will leave today, but the tide won't come until eight o'clock. We sailors aren't afraid of wind or rain, but we can't go against the tide. I have to wait for the tide to come to sail. I don't remember if it was the day before yesterday or the day before that. The old woman from your Shidetang came to Huagang and said that Young Master Ye was going home in these few days, and asked Zhang Shurong to look at the pier. When he saw Young Master Ye, he would take him back. It just so happens that our boat has no passengers in the middle cabin today. Young Master Ye, some people say you are studying in Suzhou, some people say you are studying in Shanghai. Where are you actually studying?" Weicheng nodded and answered the two words, "Suzhou".

Zhang Shurong had to greet other passengers. Weicheng wanted to find a restaurant in the inner street to have dinner. Everyone was temporarily separated in front of the gate of A Branch of Spring. The oil paper umbrella was still in Weicheng's hand. While Weicheng was sitting in the restaurant waiting for the food to come, he thought of the woman in the emerald green raincoat again. When the meat slices stir-fried with vegetables were served, the green of the vegetable leaves was the same as the color of the raincoat, equally bright and vivid. He thought this woman looked very familiar, but he couldn't remember where he had seen her. He searched through his mind: Shanghai, Suzhou; Suzhou, Shanghai; also thought of: speech competition; like a scene by scene of a movie, just can not remember.

### A Mother Wants to Remarry

‚Äî Ye Xiuyi

Tragically, my father died the year before last; now, my mother has fallen in love again!

My mother is not yet forty this year, and her charm is undiminished. Because she is good at socializing and her life is very extravagant, she was originally a student who married my father to indulge in vanity and live a luxurious life, so she was willing to be my father's concubine.

These past two years have been a period of brewing for my mother's choice of a partner. During this time, the senior wife in the family took the opportunity to accuse her of infidelity and severed relations. My mother is from another town and has no parents, no close relatives or friends. In addition, she is not used to living alone, so she resolutely left this family, which is neither large nor small, with me.

I am now twenty years old and work in a cotton mill. My monthly salary can support the two of us, mother and daughter, who live like sisters. However, because my mother is addicted to tobacco (opium, cigarettes), alcohol, and gambling, our finances are inevitably tight, and our life is relatively poor. However, I often advise my mother, saying that her daughter is already grown up, and that she should endure hardship with me: (meaning she should not remarry).

However, my mother is pregnant and she will inevitably marry someone. But I, I am unwilling to go with her.

"Oil bottle girl" ‚Äì what a shameful term!

At the same time, if I go with my mother to that household for food and lodging, my surname will have to be changed. Otherwise, I think I will definitely be laughed at, especially since I am already working in society (and that man and my mother would not agree to me not changing my surname).

I don't want to be an "oil bottle girl", I don't want to change my surname. I want to ask for help, but who should I ask? Relatives and elders? I have none. Friends, sisters, classmates, colleagues? But how can I bring it up?

I have been seeing a colleague for quite some time, but because his feudal-minded parents say that my background is not clear and that I will pollute the family, they won't allow him to marry me!

Why does mother want to remarry? I secretly read her diary, and one page reads: Alas, unfortunately, I have become a widowed young woman. After his death, everything feels painful and meaningless. The inner suffering, of course, cannot be felt by those who have not experienced it, nor can it be described in writing. I want to commit suicide, but I am a person with a secondary education, I don't want to! I want to regain the happiness of life, even though I am already addicted to improper habits...

According to custom, children cannot stop their mother from remarrying. Although I want to forgive my mother, I do not want to be an "oil bottle girl" or change my surname; I cannot lose my happiness. I want to oppose my mother. My methods might be to sever relations with her or to adopt a policy of non-cooperation. At the same time, I want to insult my mother's lover... Anyway, I am already a person who is fully capable of living independently. But I don't know if it is appropriate?

Editor's note: A mother wants to remarry, this is her freedom, no one can stop her, and in this era, marriage is absolutely free, and her remarriage may be necessary for her lifelong happiness, even though she is already addicted to bad habits, and her future happiness is very slim.

Since Ms. Ye has secretly read her diary, you must already understand her pain, and you should express sympathy for her. Considering Ms. Ye's own happiness, I think it is possible to have an open and honest negotiation with your mother. Since you care about her happiness, she should also care about your happiness. Since you are able to be self-sufficient, you might as well let yourself become independent and not be an "oil bottle girl." Men can establish themselves in society and do something for society, why can't women? Moreover, you have already stepped onto the ladder of serving society.

As for your marriage, you can naturally consider it. The current object, since there is a feudal family, is of course not very suitable, but you will definitely have the opportunity to find a suitable spouse in the future.

### Glimpses into Housekeeping

‚Äî Yin

To wash gilded photo frames, it is best to use mild soap, lukewarm water, and some hydrochloric acid, and then quickly wipe lightly with some lemon juice.

If a wooden bucket for holding water cracks, it is more durable to use cement mortar to repair the crack than to use putty.

For new Yixing purple clay teapots, after pouring hot water into them every day, wrap crushed walnut meat in silk and rub diligently, and they will soon become even more glossy.

New bowls, before they are used, must first be boiled in water. If they are boiled two or three times in the soup for cooking meat, they will last longer and will not easily crack.

Sometimes it is difficult to quickly remove the stains on the washbasin. If you use salt to scrub it, the stains will be wiped away immediately.

Newly purchased writing brushes are easily damaged by moths if they are stored without use. It is best to soak them in sulfur water once, wait for them to dry completely, and then store them, which will keep them from moths for a long time.
