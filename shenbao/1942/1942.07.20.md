### Allied Submarines Sunk and Damaged Reach Ninety-Seven Vessels: Japanese Imperial Headquarters Announced Yesterday

Tokyo, 19th (Domei News Agency) – The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced today at 4:30 PM that since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War on December 8th of last year, up to July 10th of this year, the Japanese Navy has sunk and damaged a total of ninety-seven Allied submarines, of which fifty-nine were sunk and thirty-eight were damaged.

### On the Eve of the Japanese Navy Memorial Day: Rear Admiral Hiraide Delivers Broadcast Speech

Tokyo, 19th (Domei News Agency) – Rear Admiral Hiraide, chief of the Naval Reporting Department of the Japanese Imperial Headquarters, delivered a broadcast speech on the eve of the Navy Memorial Day. The gist is as follows: At the beginning of the 14th century, there was an ancient proverb that controlling the sea means controlling the world, and even now, we keenly feel its importance. Whether in the First World War, the current European War, or the Greater East Asia War, sea power always occupies a very important position. Securing sea power is not only about strengthening naval power, but also has great significance in terms of transport capacity. Since the beginning of the war, the Japanese Navy has sunk 360 enemy ships, totaling 930,000 tons. In the past month, it has sunk another 25 enemy ships, totaling 200,000 tons, in the western Indian Ocean. The tonnage of ships necessary for Britain before the war was 7,200,000 tons. Recently, Germany and Italy have been sinking an average of 600,000 tons per month. If this continues, no matter how great Britain's shipbuilding capacity is, by the end of this year, it will definitely be able to sink all the tonnage it needs. Furthermore, when the Japanese Navy operated in the south, it intercepted many enemy ships, thus further strengthening Japan's transport capacity. Moreover, Japan's transportation lines are also extremely advantageous due to the geography of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, so even if the enemy concentrates submarines to attack, it will be difficult to succeed. On the other hand, Japan's shipbuilding capacity has greatly increased, so there is no need to worry about transportation lines.

### US Mediation: British-Egyptian Relations; British Royal Brother Arrives from India; Fierce Fighting Continues on the El Alamein Front

Swiss City (Bern), 18th (Havas News Agency) – A correspondent for the Basler Nachrichten in Istanbul reports that diplomatic circles in Turkey are paying close attention to the increasing activities of the United States in Egypt. It is speculated that its purpose is clearly not limited to mediating between Britain and Egypt. The recent meetings between the British Ambassador to Egypt, Sir Miles Lampson, and King Farouk of Egypt and Prime Minister Nahas are clear evidence of this. Moreover, General Maxwell, commander of the U.S. Air Force in the Near East, in addition to holding talks with Prime Minister Nahas and Egyptian General Staff officers, also paid a visit to King Farouk. According to reliable sources, Sir Miles Lampson and General Maxwell almost informed the Egyptian authorities that if the country could change its current position and fight alongside Britain and the United States, the United States would be willing to supply the Egyptian army with a large number of armaments.

### Rumors of Conservative MPs Attacking Cabinet Members

London, 18th (Havas News Agency) – Three Labour cabinet members, namely Home Secretary Morrison, Minister of Labour Bevin, and Minister of Commerce Dalton, are expected to be subjected to fierce attacks by Conservative MPs when the House of Commons next meets. Generally, MPs will accuse Morrison of administrative corruption in the Home Office, improper handling of the confinement of enemy nationals and suspected persons, and failure to improve. They will attack Bevin for the Labour Department's violation of labour regulations regarding the working hours of female workers and child labourers. As for Commerce Minister Dalton, MPs generally believe that he has used his position to favour large trusts, harming the interests of small businesses, and is attempting to implement a principle of nationalization in the industrial sector. It is expected that this will spark a heated debate, as MPs from several parties have successively announced that they hold opinions critical of Dalton.

### British and American Merchant Ships Continue to be Sunk

Washington, 18th (Havas News Agency) – The Navy Department issued a second bulletin today, stating that a medium-sized American merchant ship was sunk by a torpedo in the Atlantic Ocean off the north coast of South America. The rescued crew members have landed in a port in the eastern part.

Washington, 18th (Havas News Agency) – The Navy Department issued a bulletin tonight stating that an American cargo ship was sunk by a torpedo somewhere several hundred miles off the east coast of the United States. The rescued crew members have arrived at a port in the United States.

Washington, 18th (Havas News Agency) – The Navy Department has just issued a bulletin stating that a small British cargo ship was sunk in the Atlantic Ocean by an enemy submarine several weeks ago. The rescued crew members have landed at a port on the east coast.

### US Trials of German Espionage Case

Washington, 18th (Havas News Agency) – Eight German operatives, who arrived in the United States in May by submarines, were divided in two groups, with the first four landing on Long Island near New York. Disguised in civilian clothes, they planted time bombs on the beach. The remaining four landed in Florida. All eight had previously resided in the United States and were well-trained in sabotage. They possessed lists of American armaments factories and had sabotaged several American railways and armaments factories. After being personally prosecuted by Attorney General Biddle, the case has been brought to court for trial. All the defendants admitted to carrying out sabotage. It is learned that the court is scheduled to pronounce sentence within the coming week.

### German Forces Divide into Three Routes to Besiege Rostov: Situation in the Middle Reaches of the Don River Gradually Stabilizes

Tokyo, 19th (Domei News Agency) – The local "Mainichi Shimbun" carries a special dispatch from Stockholm stating that, according to a Reuters dispatch from Moscow, the direction of the German offensive on the southern front has shifted south from Stalingrad to Rostov, and all efforts are being concentrated on the attack. It is also stated that the German forces attacking in this direction are divided into three routes: one along the coast of the Sea of Azov from Taganrog, one from the northeast via the Mariupol railway, and one south from the Voroshilov region.

Somewhere on the Border of Ukraine, 18th (Havas News Agency) – According to the latest news from the front, German forces in the Rostov area are currently trying their best to break through the outer defense lines of the city. Artillery batteries from both sides are exchanging fire fiercely. The Red Army General Staff seems to have decided to resolutely resist. However, it is generally believed that the defenses of Rostov are not as strong as those of Sevastopol, and it will be more difficult to defend the city. At this point, Rostov has become the main target of General von Kleist's offensive. German forces are now divided into two routes: one from west to east and the other from north to south, attacking the city in a pincer movement. In short, the German General Staff is now launching offensives in three areas: 1. Launching an offensive along the Sea of Azov towards Rostov. 2. Launching an offensive along a broad front, advancing towards the Donets River. 3. Advancing south from Millerovo towards the Don River and the Don. According to various sources, the Red Army has been continuously retreating in the Donets River basin in recent days. Since the German forces advanced south of Millerovo, the railway line from Voroshilovgrad to Stalingrad has been cut off, so the Red Army is increasingly in danger of being surrounded. However, the German advance towards Stalingrad seems to have temporarily halted, and the future success or failure depends on the outcome of the great battle in the Ostrogozhsk area. A major battle has been brewing for the past three days, and it is unlikely that the German forces will advance towards Stalingrad before this battle is over. As for the middle reaches of the Don River, the situation seems extremely stable. Fierce fighting took place last night between the cities of Migulinskaya and Kazanskaya. Although the German forces launched a fierce offensive to the north, the situation remains extremely stable.

Berlin, 19th (Haitong News Agency) – The German High Command announced last night that our forces continued to attack the retreating Soviet troops on the southern route of the Eastern Front. After establishing a bridgehead on the Donets, German forces continued to advance in the rain, and the enemy forces are now forced to retreat to the south of Millerovo, where they are being annihilated by German and Romanian forces. After occupying Voroshilovgrad, the German Air Force continued to bomb the retreating Soviet troops and rear railway lines. The enemy's offensive against the German bridgehead in the Voronezh area did not succeed.

The Soviet Union Possesses Strong Fighting Power: Counter-Offensive Successful in Voronezh

Somewhere on the Border of Ukraine, 18th (Havas News Agency) – Military experts here commented today on the war situation on the southern route of the Eastern Front, stating that the German forces are numerous and well-equipped, possessing an absolute advantage, which goes without saying. As for the location of the Red Army's main forces, although it is difficult to say for sure, one thing is certain: there are no large Red Army units in any of the threatened areas. From this, it can be seen that the Red Army General Staff's strategy is clearly to maintain its strength in order to defend the Don and Volga Rivers. Therefore, it would be a mistake to underestimate the Red Army's strength at this time. Judging from the recent large-scale counter-offensives by General Timoshenko's troops near Voronezh and east of Millerovo, it can be seen that the Red Army still possesses strong fighting power and has not lost its fighting power due to this setback.

Moscow, 18th (Havas News Agency) – The Soviet High Command issued a battle report stating that our forces continued to engage in fierce battles with enemy forces south of Voronezh and Millerovo today. Among them, our forces made slight progress on the Voronezh line and recovered several villages and towns. Nothing else is worth mentioning on other fronts. In the Baltic Sea, our fleet sank an 8,000-ton enemy transport ship.

Stockholm, 18th (Havas News Agency) – A military commentator for the Frankfurter Zeitung wrote an article today stating that, as of now, the content of General Timoshenko's defense plan is still unknown, and even the exact location of his resistance lines is unknown, because his troops have not recovered since their defeat east of Kursk and are only ordering their troops to adopt a "flexible defense" strategy, the main purpose of which is to prevent the German forces from advancing rapidly and preventing them from achieving their goals. It is a mistake to say that German tank fleets have never encountered any resistance. However, one thing can be asserted: Soviet resistance is scattered and unsystematic, so the German and allied forces did not encounter serious resistance when they first advanced east and then south. As for the capture of the city of Voronezh, it should be regarded as a preparation for the German forces to launch an offensive to the south, that is, a strategy to protect the German left flank. On the Soviet side, it is strongly argued that the Red Army has resolutely resisted in the Voronezh area. The Red Army's organ, "Red Star," stated today that the Red Army has "fiercely advanced" and used well-known 50-ton heavy tanks in combat, so it has been able to block the German advance to the north. However, Pravda acknowledged that the German forces have also deployed a large number of reinforcements. Military commentators believe that if the Red Army launches an offensive in the Voronezh area, the German General Staff's plan to advance on Stalingrad will not be realized quickly. In short, General Timoshenko's troops have indeed retreated gradually according to plan, but Moscow has not been able to confirm the German occupation of Voroshilovgrad, and it remains silent on the German frontal attack on Rostov.

As a Result of the German Offensive on the Southern Route, 90,000 Square Miles of Land is Occupied

The supply of raw materials needed by Moscow has been cut off, and the railway from Moscow to the east is now extremely congested, making it impossible to transport supplies from the eastern regions of the Soviet Union.

Berlin, 19th (Haitong News Agency) – German military sources supplemented yesterday's German battle report to Haitong News Agency, stating that the loss of Voroshilovgrad by the Soviet army has a significant impact. The German army is now immediately advancing east of the Donets and into the lower reaches of the Don River, deep into the rear of the Soviet army, cutting off the Soviet army's important roads. Voroshilovgrad is an industrial and coal mining area, so the Soviet army had prepared for street fighting in the city. The city is the entrance to the Donets Basin, which is still in the hands of the Soviet army, an important supply base for the Soviet army, and an important transportation center for the Soviet Union. The fall of the city means that the entire Donets Basin is now wide open. The richness of the region's raw materials and minerals is an irreparable loss for the Soviet Union, and its impact on the overall war situation is by no means insignificant.

### Rumors of a Change of Commander in the Southern Route of the Soviet Army

Istanbul, 19th (Haitong News Agency) – Diplomatic sources here have received news from Kuibyshev that the commander of the Southern Route of the Soviet Army has been replaced, or has been replaced by a new person in the past 24 hours. It is rumored that General Shaposhnikov, the former Chief of Staff of the Soviet Union, is the successor to General Timoshenko.

### German Paratroopers Participate in Combat on the Eastern Front

Lisbon, 18th (Domei News Agency) – According to a dispatch from Moscow, German forces in the southern region of the Eastern Front are using elite mobile forces to vigorously pursue the Soviet forces. However, the Soviet forces in the Voronezh region have not completely abandoned their positions. In addition to repeatedly attacking the Soviet reinforcements, German forces are also constantly using paratrooper units to land behind Soviet positions and fight together.

### American Military Experts Discuss the Issue of Opening a Second Battlefield: This Move is Difficult to Achieve in the Short Term

Washington, 18th (Havas News Agency) – As German forces are advancing on the southern route of the Soviet Union, various military experts are hurrying to discuss how to alleviate the pressure the Red Army is suffering from the German side. It is reported that the majority advocate opening a second battlefield immediately, but some experts believe that this is absolutely impossible under the current circumstances. They believe that only by using the British and American air forces to bomb German industrial areas on a large scale can the Soviet Union be saved and the outcome of the war be determined. One faction strongly argues that the Allied powers can currently mobilize more than 4,500 tons of merchant shipping. Using such a large transport capacity to transport distant troops to the European continent and provide military supplies is more than enough. Moreover, considering the current state of Anglo-American external communications, it is necessary to distribute all merchant ships all over the world, which is the real situation. However, the most important line of communication is still the one connecting Britain and the United States. The fact that a large number of troops and equipment are constantly being transported from the United States to Britain shows that this is ultimately the strongest and best organized line of defense. Even if some forces are withdrawn to prepare for the European landing operation, it should not cause a significant impact. This second faction believes that in order to make the opening of a second battlefield take effect quickly, at least two hundred thousand troops and three million tons of merchant ships are needed, which is beyond the capabilities of the Allied powers today. In addition, another faction believes that the so-called "invasion of the European continent" should be carried out purely by air force. If so, the United States will definitely be able to provide a great deal of assistance, because most of the American planes today can fly directly from the United States to Europe without landing in between, and can bring a part of the aviation personnel with them.

New York, 18th (Havas News Agency) – The New York Times published an editorial commenting on the recent situation on the Eastern Front, stating that the Soviets will be greatly disappointed if the promise to open a second battlefield cannot be realized. Although the Soviet army is implementing a counter-offensive on all fronts, the situation is still extremely severe. Previously, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov's visit to Britain and the United States revealed that Britain and the United States were making every effort to support the Soviet Union, which was extremely satisfactory. However, the Soviet government clearly knows that the proposal to open a second battlefield cannot be realized in the short term.

### Britain and Germany Conduct Mutual Air Raids

Berlin, 19th (Haitong News Agency) – According to authoritative sources here, several enemy bombers appeared over the coast of East Prussia last night and dropped several bombs, but there were no losses.

Stockholm, 19th (Haitong News Agency) – According to London, a German plane dropped bombs on a town in eastern England this morning, but the name of the town was not announced.

### French Cabinet Holds Meeting

Vichy, 18th (Havas News Agency) – The Cabinet held a state council meeting at 10:30 AM today, chaired by Marshal Pétain himself. First, Prime Minister Laval reported on the domestic and international situation, the progress of his trip to Paris to meet with German authorities, and the success of recruiting workers to work in Germany. Then, Minister of Agriculture Le Roy Ladurie explained the government's steps to supply vegetables and butter to major cities.

### The Disposition of French Warships in Alexandria: Differing US and French Views; Negotiations Still Ongoing

Vichy, 18th (Havas News Agency) – Regarding the issue of the disposition of French warships in Alexandria, since the French government disclosed the notes repeatedly exchanged between the French and American governments, political figures here have remained silent about the progress of the US-French negotiations, saying only that the views of the US and France are still deeply different. But this does not mean that the negotiations have broken down, because President Roosevelt's letter stated that this issue is not related to the fate of the Egyptian war, so it must be regarded as having a transcendent nature. Whenever Prime Minister Laval encounters an extremely delicate issue, he informs the French and international public opinion circles of the content of the diplomatic documents. This is the second time. The first time was after the British army invaded Madagascar. The main points of the above two matters are the same. In essence, it is that France still adheres to the armistice agreement, while the United States protects the actions taken by Britain and does not want to put forward a concrete solution. There is no need to discuss the legitimate status of Prime Minister Laval. In a word, it is to abide by the provisions of Article 8 of the Franco-German Armistice Agreement and Article 12 of the Franco-Italian Armistice Agreement (stipulating that French warships should be docked in French ports). On the German and Italian side, they have formally provided guarantees that they will abide by this clause. Even if Alexandria is occupied, the French warships will not be regarded as war prizes, making France's position even stronger.

### Two Terrorist Incidents Occur in Paris

Paris, 18th (Havas News Agency) – Two more terrorist incidents occurred here yesterday. The first incident took place in the 4th arrondissement, where someone threw a bomb in front of an office recruiting workers to work in Germany. Fortunately, there were no deaths or injuries, except for minor damage to the rear of the building. Later, someone threw a bomb at a worker registration office elsewhere, killing one policeman and one passerby, and injuring one girl. The perpetrators of both cases escaped without a trace.

### Rice Shops in Two Concessions to Distribute Grain in Three Phases Starting Today; Flour Price Reduced by 30 Cents with Third Coupon

According to a report from a Datong News Agency reporter, rice shops in the two concessions will start distributing the third phase of rations today. One liter of broken rice, half a liter of white rice, and one and a half catties of flour will be issued with the third coupon. The broken rice and white rice will be sold together for 3.8 yuan in reserve notes, and the flour will be sold for 3.4 yuan in reserve notes. It is noted that in the previous phase, it was half a liter of broken rice and one liter of white rice. This time, the quantities of white rice and broken rice are inversely proportional. The price of flour has been reduced by 30 cents compared to the previous phase.

Flour Purchase Price Has Been Suppressed

The reason for the reduction in the price of flour is that the Shanghai Municipal Council's Flour Control Office sells flour to baked goods merchants for only 85 yuan in reserve notes per bag, while the Rice and Grain Office distributes it to rice shops for 100 yuan in reserve notes. Therefore, the rice merchants once requested the same treatment. However, when the third phase of flour payments was attached last week, the original price was still paid, but it is expected to be returned this week, also priced at 85 yuan per bag. The deadline for the sale of the third-phase household rations is the 25th of this month.

Tenfold Penalty for Rice Shops Concealing Grain

The 659 contracted rice shops must comply with the regulations for distributing grain. The report forms for the second phase of household rations must be submitted to the Shanghai Municipal Council's Rice and Grain Management Committee or the Grain and Food Price Management Section at No. 6 Fuli Road within the specified time. The above report form must be submitted together with the coupons returned from the rice sales. In any case, the quantity of rice sold by each rice shop must be completely consistent with the quantity of rice recorded on the returned coupons. If the quantity of rice sold exceeds the quantity of rice recorded on the returned coupons, a penalty of ten times the price of the excess rice will be imposed.

Second Batch of Rice Coupons Issued Today

The procedures for issuing the second batch of rice purchase coupons at the distribution offices have been prepared. It is scheduled to start issuing them to taxpayers from [date]. Taxpayers can purchase the fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth phases of household rations with the coupons. The date for receiving the rice coupons is determined by the date recorded on the back of the seasonal property tax receipt for taxpayers in the Public Concession, which is the same day as the last time the first batch of purchase coupons was received. Taxpayers in the French Concession can receive the rice coupons at the original distribution offices with their property tax receipts. The dates have been communicated to the Bao Chiefs and household heads by the chiefs of the district police stations.

### Over 1,800 British Nationals to Leave Shanghai Next Month

According to the English-language "The China Press", yesterday (18th), an official from the Japanese Consulate told "The China Press" reporter that British nationals will indeed be evacuated from Japan and Shanghai in mid-August. The evacuation ships have also been decided, namely the "Kamakura Maru" and "Tatsuta Maru". Eleven people, including British Consul Mr. Kelliher, will come to Shanghai. In addition to the one ship already designated, another postal ship may also be dispatched to carry these additional expatriates. The "Kamakura Maru" will carry British nationals evacuated from Japan, while the "Tatsuta Maru" will carry British nationals evacuated from China. It is reported that the "Kamakura Maru" will anchor in Shanghai to take on passengers that the "Tatsuta Maru" cannot accommodate. The total number of expatriates being evacuated is currently estimated at 1,800, but the number may increase if British nationals from outer ports are also selected for evacuation at the same time. It is said that not many British nationals in Shanghai intend to leave in this evacuation.

### Shen Bao Readers' Scholarship Applications Open Today; Application Deadline is the 28th of This Month, Screening Test to be Held on August 1st

Applications for the third Shen Bao Readers' Scholarship will open today. All scholarship regulations, application forms, and registration certificates have been printed by this newspaper. The application forms printed this time will be issued until they are exhausted. The application period will end on the 28th of this month, and the screening test for registration applicants will begin on August 1st. Since the application and screening dates have been set, there will be no extensions or changes. Therefore, we urge all applicants to apply as soon as possible to avoid missing out, and to pay attention to the notices published daily after registration to avoid delays.

Appeal to Readers for Generous Donations

Current donations received for this year's scholarship from all sectors total over 60,000 yuan in reserve certificates. Given the current economic difficulties and high tuition fees, although we have received generous donations from all sectors, we are still concerned that we will not be able to provide sufficient assistance to impoverished students. In addition to our staff's efforts to solicit donations, they have also made contributions to the best of their ability. We hope that all sectors will continue to maintain their enthusiasm for supporting education and continue to cooperate with us, so that fewer impoverished students will be forced to drop out of school. This will reduce the Shen Bao Readers' Scholarship's sense of guilt and enable all sectors of society to cultivate more talent. We deeply believe that the importance of holding this year's scholarship is even greater than in previous years. Providing relief to those who have dropped out of school depends on generous fundraising. On the day of the application launch, we reiterate our appeal to all sectors, and we hope that our efforts will be appreciated.

Pay Close Attention to Registration Procedures

Applications for this year's scholarship will open today. Impoverished students who are unable to pay tuition fees, from the fifth grade of elementary school to university, can personally come to this newspaper's business department to obtain the scholarship regulations and application form, and fill them out completely. However, it should be noted that: 1. The grades listed on the report card must be 70 or above in each major subject, or if one major subject is below 70, the other two subjects must be 80 or above in order to be eligible to participate in the screening test. Therefore, students who assess that their grades do not meet the above requirements do not need to apply for registration, as registration would be in vain. 2. The application form must be filled out in ink and in regular script, and must not be sloppy. If impoverished students do not handle the application for scholarships with seriousness, it seems that their spirit of hard work is lacking. The Shen Bao Readers' Scholarship is intended to reward outstanding impoverished students, and those with illegible handwriting will be rejected. 3. For all procedures that have been announced in the regulations or in the daily notices published by this newspaper after the application launch, inquiries will no longer be answered. This is because this newspaper's scholarship does not want to reward students who are careless, and thus betray the generous intentions of the donors. 4. Applications from students or parents who have written to inquire about registration before the application launch will be deemed invalid and must follow the procedures to personally obtain a registration certificate from this newspaper and follow the regulations.

Conduct Screening Test on Schedule

After registration, this newspaper will begin to review the grades of the applicants. Those who meet the standards will be announced in the newspaper, and they will be notified to come to the newspaper to receive the screening test admission ticket. Those who do not meet the standards can retrieve their documents with the registration certificate issued by this newspaper. The reasons for this newspaper's screening of applicants are: 1. Uneven academic levels of students. 2. Inconsistent grading standards among schools. 3. To assess whether students' general knowledge meets general standards. 4. To prevent cheating such as altering grades. This screening is entrusted to a well-reputed school in Shanghai to conduct. Once the screening process is completed, we will investigate the family circumstances of each student.

### Market Trends

Chinese Stocks

The fluctuations in Chinese stocks are gradually becoming greater, no longer the smooth upward trend of the past, which is an important point to note.

Last week, department store stocks continued to rise, with Wing On taking the lead and Sincere following. People praised Wing On's performance, which benefited Sincere Department Store. In addition, Wing On's management has recently been prominent, which has excited shareholders. There is also a connection.

The yarn and cloth market is sluggish, and textile stocks are inevitably affected. Wing On is an exception due to capital increase. The Zhabei Water & Electricity and China General Edison, which soared last week due to rumors, have shown a reaction this week, and the momentum is not light.

New pharmaceutical stocks are fluctuating, industrial stocks are showing mixed gains and losses, and financial stocks are inactive. The sneaky trading of new chips is most fascinating.

Government Bonds

Last week was the second week of the seesaw in the bond market, rising first and then weakening, about one yuan lower than the previous week. If this kind of consolidation can be broken, there will be a greater change. Currently, it is still uncertain.

Qianyi, Lianhe, and Xinfeng initially advanced but then retreated, but it was just profit-taking. Tongli and others dumped their positions at the beginning of the week, but then gave up. Powerful players are mostly on the sidelines.

After the currency change, the circulation of currency in the market is somewhat tight. However, the space for capital activities is also narrower than before. The compression of the bond market is still related to the interest rate issue.

Yarn and Cloth

Double Horse spot goods are priced according to Blue Phoenix. The situation in which the price changes in yarn and cloth are based on Japanese yarn Dong Pi has been completed in both form and substance. The so-called crackdown on speculation in yarn and cloth in recent months can be said to have come to an end.

The market continued to weaken last week. The Phoenix decreased by more than 200 yuan, the Horse retreated by more than 600 steps, and the Longtou also declined by about 10 pounds. The entire market was sluggish, and most people were pessimistic. This is the whole picture of the current yarn and cloth market.

Grains

Although the market has been sealed off, the market is surprisingly active. Beans, bean cakes, bran, red sorghum, and so on all rose in price, which is a unique phenomenon last week. This was influenced by the rising wheat market in Jiangbei. According to reports, the Tianjin grain market also rose across the board last week. The Tianjin authorities implemented mandatory price settlement, based on the market price on the 15th of this month.

### Take Care of Yourself

— Guo Jiaji

As the saying goes, "A bird about to die, its chirping is mournful; a person about to die, their words are benevolent." Few people understand bird language, so few people pay attention to their mournful chirping. However, the words of people before their death are often valued by the world.

In 399 BC, Greek philosopher Socrates sacrificed his life for the pursuit of truth. At the time, the charges were "teaching doctrines that contradict religion" and "inducing young people to follow evil paths." For these trumped-up charges, he was sentenced to death and forced to drink poison and die.

Before his death, his student and friend Crito asked him what instructions he had. He said a very ordinary sentence, "Nothing else, but I often teach you to take care of yourselves. This work can be said to be done for me, and the principles can be said to be done for yourselves..." This is the last word of this philosopher.

"Take care of yourself" is a most ordinary sentence, but it is also a most virtuous sentence. Regardless of the environment, especially in times of hardship, if we want to achieve something, we must take care of ourselves. This is a prerequisite for everything.

Here, taking care of yourself is not selfish, but to do more work and to make this world a more perfect world.

So for ourselves and for others, we must take care of ourselves.

### Words of a Tuberculosis Patient

— Mo Ming

I believe that the way to treat tuberculosis is to strive for an active position. Patients should be the masters of the bacteria, not slaves to the bacteria; they should try their best to control the disease, not be controlled by the disease; they should make the disease adapt to the patient's life as much as possible, not make life unconditionally surrender to the disease.

Patients who are good at being masters do not necessarily regard the disease as a slave, but may regard the disease as a guest. What is more lovable is to regard the disease as a burden, a habitual, clumsy burden. Although he has this burden more than ordinary people, the difference between them is only equal to people who wear hats and those who do not, those who wear ties and those who do not. As long as a person can be the master of the burden and not be a slave to the burden, then even if the burden never goes away in his lifetime, he will not think it is bitter, and may even enjoy having this burden.

The art of tuberculosis patients is "forgetfulness." The tuberculosis patients who are least troubled by the disease are probably the best at this art. But the "forgetfulness" mentioned here refers to forgetting the disease, not forgetting reality, forgetting life. Many patients go against this, which is very wrong. There are also many patients who try to forget the disease, life, and reality together. This effort is often in vain and has little hope of success; and even if it succeeds, it is useless and not worthwhile.

Regarding medicine (such as tonics), a tuberculosis patient is best not to believe in it at all, otherwise, he must believe in it thoroughly. There is no cure for tuberculosis, but we are still helpless to rely on some drugs. Rather than saying that we hope they have a therapeutic function, it is more that we value their ability to make patients believe and generate strength. This power of belief often has unexpected effects.

All beliefs, no matter how ignorant, wrong, if their results are indeed beneficial to the believers, we don't have to overthrow them, oppose them. We don't have to persuade a tuberculosis patient who believes in medicine to stop taking it, just as we don't have to make a devout Christian doubt God: even if a person is dreaming empty dreams, we don't have to expose him, unless we can give him better comfort after exposing him.

Eating tonics is the same. People with tuberculosis should pay attention to nutrition, but avoid being superstitious about nutrition. If a patient has the idea that "milk is supreme, eggs are the best, getting them means life, losing them means death," it is of course not a problem if he can afford them, but what if he can't afford them? Such a person is what is called a "slave to the disease."

### University Impressions Record

(II) Six Types of University Students

In universities, there are all sorts of students: those skilled in socializing, playboys, politicians, business experts, bookworms, and university students who study for the pursuit of knowledge.

The initial motive for entering university should be to study advanced knowledge. However, this seems to be just "theory," and the reality is not entirely so. Some university students harbor other intentions and simply don't treat studying as a serious matter. Their entry into university seems to serve another purpose, and the life of studying or the pretense of being a university student is merely a tool to achieve that purpose. For example, social butterflies spend their days busy making friends with the opposite sex, attending social gatherings, watching movies, dancing, playing cards, or engaging in other fashionable pastimes. This is their daily "homework." When they are forced to attend lectures, they are always lazy and listless. Playboys change into fashionable new clothes every day, believing this is the best way to show off. They are the sons of wealthy families, not lacking money, food, and clothing. Their purpose in entering university is only to obtain a qualification, only to acquire the label of a university student, so that they can operate more conveniently in society in the future. They always maintain an indifferent and apathetic attitude towards the teachings of professors and the knowledge in books. The speaker is earnest, but the listener is dismissive. They are not afraid of failing exams, not afraid of not getting credits, and not afraid of repeating a year. Professors feel most discouraged and have the biggest headaches when they encounter these two types of students.

There are also many politicians among university students. They regard the university society as a training ground for planning strategies and engaging in intrigue. Their desire for leadership is very strong, gathering "comrades," forming "factions," hoping to win over the "masses," and gain "political power." They can be found in all kinds of school groups and gatherings. They are active everywhere, fighting openly and secretly with "political enemies," using various strategies to achieve victory. In addition, there are some university students with a "business sense" who take advantage of the opportunity to study to pursue petty profits. They sell new and used goods among their classmates, make big plans, and their shrewdness is no less than that of the big merchants in the market. In this tense atmosphere, it is naturally impossible for these two types of university students to concentrate on their studies.

If a university does not have bookworms, it does not seem to be a university. Bookworms are also called book moths. These university students bury themselves in old papers all day long, regarding books as the most sacred things in the world. They do not know what extracurricular activities are, and they do not ask about world affairs, so they lack practical knowledge. They read textbooks, lecture notes, notes, and reference books thoroughly, and may get very high scores during exams, but in fact, they inevitably have the problem of being dogmatic and swallowing knowledge whole without digesting it. Therefore, whether they can acquire true knowledge and whether they can acquire the knowledge and skills to deal with the world through university education is a question.

Finally, there is the kind of university student who studies for the sake of pursuing knowledge. This kind of student is a true university student and the pillar of the country's future. They understand the purpose of university education, and they know how important the responsibilities of a university student are to the individual, family, society, and country. Therefore, they feel that they should make the most of those four precious years to complete the most perfect university education. They know how to listen to lectures, take notes, prepare textbooks, and reference books. They do not pay too much attention to scores and credits, nor do they underestimate them. They know the importance of libraries and laboratories in university education, and they also know the meaning of the influence of professors and the mutual refinement of good friends in university life. In short, they have balanced development in all aspects of morality, intelligence, physical fitness, and social skills. Four years of university education turn them into excellent intellectuals, adding some useful talents to the country. If every university student can take this kind of university student as a model, the success of university education is guaranteed.

### Sharing the Same Boat in Storms

— He Jia Zhi

(VII) Swift Thunder

Cui Zhen didn't care about any suspicion, stepped forward, and grabbed Wei Cheng's wrist, asking, "Brother Cheng, what's wrong with you? Your hand is ice cold, what's written on this paper?" On the one hand, she was asking, on the other hand, she was looking at Wei Cheng's face, and on the other hand, she was also looking at the paper in Wei Cheng's hand. Wei Cheng slumped down, his eyes looking at the paper that had attracted his attention, and he finished reading the few words on it in an instant. He said weakly, "Sister Cui Zhen, it's nothing? Please go out. Don't make a fuss." Cui Zhen said, "What's written on this paper?" Wei Cheng said, "It's nothing, please go out." Cui Zhen said, "Is your body okay? You just gave me a scare." Wei Cheng said, "I'm fine, it's nothing, nothing." He waved his hand.

Cui Zhen had always respected Wei Cheng's wishes. Seeing that Wei Cheng wanted her to go out, she went out, and looked back at Wei Cheng when she reached the door. After Wei Cheng waited for Cui Zhen to go out, he spread the paper on the table and read it carefully. It turned out to be the will of his mother, Madam Li, which read these lines: "To be known by my son Wei Cheng: Your father died at the hands of Cheng Bing. You need not ask why Cheng Bing killed your father. In my family's old belongings, there is a small portrait of Cheng Bing, which has been hidden for a long time. But I have been unable to find it in recent years. My illness is hopeless, and I am also unable to search for it. Alas! Cheng Bing has fled far away after the incident. When you grow up, you should avenge your father. But the Ye family has only you as a son, and avenging your father carries the danger of being killed, so you must have a son so that your father has a grandson before you can avenge him. Mother's will."

Wei Cheng looked at it carefully, and tears could no longer be stopped, one drop, two drops, three drops, pattering on the will. In order to protect that will, he immediately took out a handkerchief to dry his tears. He suddenly stood up, clenching his fists with both hands, and punching his chest; then he exhaled a long breath. When he looked up, what came into his sight were the portraits of his father, Lord Aitang, and his mother, Madam Li. Tears came to his eyes again. Standing in front of the portraits, he said, "Dad, Mom, your son is in front of you. Mother's will; your son has seen it. Your son has been dreaming, in a dream...," he felt a little dizzy, took two steps back, and leaned on the table: without the table, he might have fallen down. (132)
