### Nehru Discusses Anglo-Indian Relations

Cripps Arrives in Cairo

Remarks to Reporters

Allahabad, India, 16th (Havas) - Indian National Congress leader Nehru recently spoke to reporters about Anglo-Indian relations, stating, "We have reached the limit of concession. What we have proposed to Sir Stafford Cripps, the British special envoy to India, is not a request from Britain, but something indispensable for us to assume our current responsibilities. I was surprised that the members of the All-India National Congress are willing to make compromises and seek an agreement. Most colleagues, even those who are indifferent, believe we have conceded too much and abandoned our basic stance. But we are willing to make these concessions regardless of everything, solely to fulfill our duty to the Indian motherland."

May Be Forced to Enter the War

Cape Town, 16th (Reuters) - Van der Byl told a gathering of sailors today that South Africa will become a strategic location in the coming World War.

### Germany Takes Over American Property

Berlin, 16th (Haitong Agency) - It was officially announced here yesterday that all businesses in Germany owned by Americans or primarily controlled by Americans will be managed by state administrators appointed by the German authorities. The official announcement stated that the U.S. government has recently appointed special officials to manage or close enterprises with German capital. German funds in the U.S. have long been frozen. This action by President Roosevelt is a further step in interfering with German property. Other American countries have also begun to follow suit by confiscating German funds. Therefore, the German government has no choice but to extend the application of the ordinance on the disposal of enemy property promulgated on January 15, 1940, to the United States and its territories. In the future, German authorities may appoint state administrators to take over all businesses and enterprises in Germany owned by Americans or primarily controlled by Americans. People from the United States, Alaska, the Panama Canal Zone, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Guam, the Hawaiian Islands, Tutuila Island, and the Philippine Islands will be subject to this order.

### 3. Retracing the Past (Part 1)

India is a cultural—especially a religious—nation. Politics and military affairs are not the strengths of this nation. Moreover, geographically, it is "surrounded by the three seas and backed by the snowy mountains" (Records of the Western Regions of the Great Tang Dynasty, Volume 3), isolated from other lands on all sides. Therefore, except for the most recent period, events that have occurred in India have rarely had global significance. However, this does not mean that India has not had a glorious page in its past history.

Ancient India

India is one of the four ancient civilizations of the world, but its enlightenment came later than Egypt, Babylon, and China. The situation of the local natives during the Stone Age is not very traceable. Between 2,000 and 3,000 BC, the Dravidians (Dravida) invaded Balochistan via Mesopotamia and then settled in India. These people were greatly despised by the Aryans who later invaded India, called "noseless," "black-skinned," and "unclean," and were degraded to slaves when the four castes (Castes, i.e., classes) were divided later on. However, they were not a cultureless people; they had already used metal tools and had an independent writing system, but they were not as civilized as the Aryans.

The earliest cradle of the Aryans was probably on the grasslands from the Caspian Sea to the Danube River. Later, some settled in Europe and became the ancestors of today's Europeans; others migrated eastward and entered the area of the Five Rivers of India (i.e., the upper reaches of the Indus River) around 2000 BC. They gradually moved eastward, reaching the Ganges River area from Punjab, conquering the original Dravidians and forming the masters of India. The historical era of India began from this time. Their oldest classics are the so-called Four Vedas (Veda means the meaning of enlightenment), which are all poems of a religious nature. The oldest of these is the Rigveda Samhita, which was produced around 1500 BC, praising the great achievements of the Aryan race in crossing the Afghan mountains and settling in India, and describing their wars with the "noseless" and "black-skinned" natives. The Aryans were originally nomadic people, but agriculture was also well-developed. Gradually, they were divided into many clans and tribes, and wars constantly occurred between them, but at the same time, they gradually established national rule. Between the tenth and sixth centuries BC, the cultural center had moved to the Ganges River basin, and many small countries were built, such as Kuru (Kmu), Kashi (Kasi), Panchala (Pauchalr), Magadha (Mayadr), Vatsa (Vasla), etc., each occupying a territory and vying for supremacy. The four-caste system also originated at this time. This system divides the people into four classes: 1. Brahmins (Brahmaus), i.e., monks; 2. Kshatriyas (Ksatriyas), i.e., nobles; 3. Vaishyas (Vaisgas), i.e., merchants and industrialists; 4. Shudras (Sudras), i.e., slaves. The first three were Aryans, and the latter were natives. This class system was extremely strict, and intermarriage between classes was absolutely not allowed. The Shudras were especially despised by society, considered "untouchables." Even after more than a thousand years, this prejudice has not been broken.

Between the sixth and seventh centuries BC, there had already been a reaction against this class system. The Aryans in the Punjab region strictly adhered to the "caste" system and the religious Vedic classics, while some Aryan races in the Ganges River basin showed a tendency to oppose it, and the rise of Buddhism was the most powerful manifestation. Buddha was the prince of the small kingdom of Kapilavastu (Kapliavastu) at the southern foot of the Himalayas, belonging to the Kshatriya class according to the "caste" system. Seeing the suffering of all beings and the tyranny of the Brahmin monks, he resolutely abandoned his noble status and became a monk, establishing Buddhism with great enlightenment, advocating compassion and equality, and standing in opposition to the old Brahmin doctrines of India. He preached everywhere in India and also obtained the protection of King Ajatasatru (Alatasestm) of the then-strong Magadha Kingdom. Buddhism replaced the original Brahmin religion and spread widely.

However, although India was constantly developing in culture and religion at that time, it made little progress in politics. From the tenth to the fifth and sixth centuries BC, there were always small countries standing side by side, not subordinate to each other, and therefore lacking the power to resist foreign aggression. In 518 BC, Darius, the famous king of Persia, invaded India from the east, conquered the border provinces of India, advanced to the Indus River, obtained tribute, and returned. It was not until the Magadha Kingdom became strong and its power greatly expanded, and Ajatasatru conquered the Ganges River area, that India gradually had a tendency to unification, but it was still not enough to resist foreign aggression. In the fourth century BC, the Nanda Dynasty (Nanda Dquasty) succeeded Ajatasatru, and Alexander the Great, the famous king of Macedonia, launched a large-scale eastward expedition. After defeating the Persian army, he continued eastward, crossing the Oxus River and the Jaxartes River, cutting through the Hindu Kush Mountains, and harassing the northwest border of India. In 328 BC, he crossed the Indus River to Punjab, advancing towards the Ganges River basin. However, due to the long-term fighting, the soldiers were exhausted, and the climate was unbearably hot, so he returned to the west and soon passed away. Alexander's expedition to India did not achieve much, but it invisibly promoted India's first real unification.

The birthplace of Buddhism

Bodh Gaya (Budh Gaya) is 292 miles from Calcutta and is the birthplace of Buddhism. The picture shows the famous Bodhi tree, where it is said that Sakyamuni Buddha (i.e., the prince of Suddhodana) preached under it. Buddhists flock to pay their respects, making it a famous holy site in India. To the east of the Bodhi tree is the Great Temple (Great Temple).

### Laval Arrives in Vichy from Paris to Form Cabinet, Darlan Retains Naval Command, France Expected to Abandon Wait-and-See Policy

Vichy, 16th, Havas—Laval, accompanied by his son-in-law and Ambassador Brinon, arrived at the Parc Hotel, the seat of the French government, at 12:25 this afternoon. Marshal Pétain and Darlan both came out to greet them. A large crowd gathered in front of the gate, an unprecedented scene. Military police were on the scene to maintain order. When Laval stepped out of the large black car, he was surrounded by photographers and reporters. Laval looked solemn. As he walked to the front of the hotel, the crowd was silent, as if savoring the great significance of this historical moment.

Vichy, 16th, Reuters—Laval arrived in Vichy shortly after noon today. Pétain immediately received him and talked for about 30 minutes.

London, 16th, Reuters—Paris Radio broadcast this morning that Laval had submitted his cabinet list to Pétain. The broadcaster also confirmed that Darlan would be the head of the army, navy, and air force.

Vichy, 16th, Havas—The government today ordered Admiral Darlan, Chief of the French Navy, to retain his current command.

Paris, 16th, Havas—French government leader Laval met with many important people here yesterday to discuss the reorganization of the government, including Ambassador Brinon to the occupied zone, General Bridoux, several former cabinet members, and several famous journalists. Laval is scheduled to return to Vichy this morning to confer with Pétain and Darlan.

Paris, 16th, Havas—French government leader Laval yesterday received Scapini, the representative in charge of French workers and prisoners of war in Germany.

Vichy, 16th, Havas—According to well-informed sources, Marshal Pétain will issue a declaration clarifying the reasons for the government reorganization. There is still much speculation about the date of the formal organization.

Berlin, 15th, Havas—Regarding the French cabinet reorganization, a semi-official statement was issued, commenting, "The German official side has not yet expressed its opinion on the matter. However, the impression gained by political figures is that France will abandon its wait-and-see policy, because this policy will endanger France in the shortest possible time."

### Washington Closely Watches French Political Situation, US Suspends Supply Shipments to France, American Citizens in France Ordered to Prepare for Evacuation

Washington, 15th, Havas—Undersecretary of State Welles told reporters that the US government would not express any opinion on the French cabinet reorganization until an official announcement was made. According to a telegram from Ambassador Leahy, former Prime Minister Laval had gone to Paris to discuss the formation of a new cabinet, but the information he sent was preliminary in nature. He refused to comment on rumors that Ambassador Leahy would return home to report on his duties. In addition, French Ambassador to the United States Henry-Haye requested to meet with Undersecretary Welles, and the two sides are scheduled to meet tomorrow.

Washington, 16th, Reuters—Well-informed sources here said today that it is too early to predict whether US Ambassador to Vichy Leahy will be recalled for consultations or whether US-French relations will break down as a result of developments in France. However, both are possible. There is no disagreement in US official circles about the implications of Laval's return to power. However, the most prudent policy that the United States will follow has not yet been decided. One concrete point has been clarified by the US government: the United States will temporarily suspend the resumption of supply shipments to French North Africa pending clarification of the situation by the Vichy side.

Washington, 15th, Havas—Undersecretary of State Welles told reporters that the shipment of American non-military goods to mainland France and its North African territories has been temporarily suspended pending a definite statement of position from Vichy. Two French merchant ships carrying food and certain key manufactured goods, preparing to sail from New York to North Africa in accordance with the agreement reached last week, have also been prevented from departing. In addition, a Red Cross ship loaded with milk and children's clothing, preparing to sail to the free zone of France, has also been postponed.

Washington, 16th, Reuters—It is understood that the United States has advised American citizens residing in the unoccupied areas of France to return home as soon as possible, but only ordinary American citizens are affected. This measure is unrelated to Laval's coming to power. American embassy and consular personnel are not affected.

International Newspapers Comment on the French Political Situation

Swiss Capital, 15th, Havas—The Lausanne Daily recently commented on the French political situation, stating, "France has adopted a policy more conducive to building a new European order, but this is not a sign that the country is preparing to re-enter the war. France, defeated for two years, is doing its best to be self-sufficient and has not established a close relationship with Germany. As for the issue of abolishing the boundary between the occupied and free zones, it is not yet possible, because Germany cannot give up its control over the French coast and the French railway transportation center, namely Paris. Even the proposal for the French government to move back to Paris is not possible at this time, because wouldn't this mean that the US ambassador would be stationed in the German rear? In short, future changes in the French political situation may be interpreted as 'strengthening the Western Front'." In addition, various newspapers here carried dispatches from reporters stationed in Berlin stating that German political figures have been deeply impressed by the evolution of the French political situation and believe that there will be a major achievement of a decisive nature in the construction of a new Europe in the future.

Swiss Capital, 15th, Havas—The news of the French cabinet reorganization has been commented on by various newspapers here, all of which believe that the matter is very important. The Fribourg Gazette stated, "France's situation is not only extremely painful, but also full of crises. Marshal Pétain revealed 'a glorious peace' as the guiding principle for handling state affairs two years ago, and he will certainly be able to adhere to it at this time." The Neue Zürcher Zeitung stated, "The reorganization of the French government is a major event in the French political situation since Laval resigned as Deputy Prime Minister on December 13, 1940. Head of State Pétain will definitely pay close attention to the situation in Paris and has decided to invite Laval to join the cabinet again, so that the country can achieve extreme stability. As for Germany, when it attacked the Soviet Union in June 1941, it seemed to think that it did not need to consider France's attitude. By this time, France was still interested in Germany being able to fully attack the Soviet Union. The difference is that Germany no longer considers this attitude of the French government to be sufficient. It seems that Laval's comeback is undoubtedly for France to take a clearer attitude towards Britain and the United States, but Head of State Pétain still hopes to maintain friendly relations with the United States." The Tribune also stated, "Laval's position in the new government will definitely be more important than before. In other words, Head of State Pétain has handed over the Council of Ministers to Laval. From then on, Laval is only responsible to Head of State Pétain." In addition, according to London news carried by various newspapers here, British political circles are evaluating the French political situation in terms of US-French relations. The Neue Zürcher Zeitung stated, "The reorganization of the French government happened at a time when the country's position is becoming increasingly consolidated, which is quite surprising. As for US-French relations, the dismissal of General Weygand a few months ago once strained diplomatic relations, and this is the second time. However, the US government still has unwavering trust in the guarantees provided by Head of State Pétain." According to Berlin news, German newspapers have not commented on the French political situation. Only one news agency issued a message stating that the German government cannot express its attitude until it receives official information. However, it is rumored that Laval will preside over the new government, which should be considered very important. German news sources believe that Laval's visit to Berlin is not impossible, but it is too early to say at this time. In short, judging from the recent situation in France, the wait-and-see policy of the visiting country has ended.

### Rundstedt Succeeds as German Military Commander in Occupied Zone of France

London, 16th, Reuters—It is confirmed here that Rundstedt has now succeeded Witzleben as the German military commander in the German-occupied zone of France. The German garrison in France is about 20 to 23 divisions, with a total of 340,000 soldiers.

### Relations Between Soviet Union and Turkey Growing Tense, Countries May Sever Ties at Any Time, Turkish Ambassador to Soviet Union Returns Home to Report

Turkish Capital, 16th, Havas—According to political sources here, relations between Turkey and the Soviet Union are growing tense, to an extent unprecedented since the outbreak of the European war. The two countries may sever ties at any time. Two Soviet citizens are imprisoned in connection with the assassination plot against German Ambassador von Papen, and the court in Uşağı has detained them for interrogation. The Soviet Union is extremely resentful of this. The British side is doing its best to mediate, but in fact, the Soviet Union's tough attitude is enough to affect Turkey's neutrality, causing it to move closer to Germany. According to observations from some sources here, the Soviet Union's goal is to create a situation at any cost that draws Turkey into the vortex of war, and to force Britain to open a second front in the Near East with a fait accompli, thereby drawing German troops from the Eastern Front to the south.

Berlin, 15th, Allied Press—According to a German News Agency dispatch from Stockholm on the 15th, Turkish Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Akte, departed from Kuybyshev a few days ago to return home. The purpose of this trip has not been stated. Turkey is in a subtle position between Germany and the Soviet Union and will soon be forced to decide its attitude. The ambassador's return home is to consult with his own government.

### Portuguese President Re-elected for Third Term, Issues Inaugural Declaration, Resolves to Maintain Neutrality

Congressman Pinto delivered a speech on behalf of Congress, stating, "Certain belligerent countries, under the pretext of strategic needs, disregard our sovereignty over overseas territories. Fortunately, the Tonton government was able to maintain neutrality." President Carmona then delivered a reply, stating, "At this time of world unrest, the people of all countries should respect our neutrality. I resolve to devote myself to serving the country." After the ceremony, the President walked to the balcony of Congress, and the people cheered him enthusiastically.

### Spain Calls Up New Recruits

Madrid, 16th, Havas—The military authorities here have ordered all Spaniards who will be 21 years old this year, i.e., the 1942 class, to register for enlistment. Physical examinations and selection will be held on April 26.

### Bulgaria Expresses Loyalty to Germany, Hitler Presents Bulgarian King with Decoration

Bulgarian Capital, 15th, Havas—Bulgarian Prime Minister Filov recently sent a telegram to German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, reiterating his country's gratitude to Germany and the Bulgarian people's ardent hope for a bright future connected with Germany.

Sofia, 16th, Havas—German leader's special representative Dannpae, after arriving in Sofia on Tuesday evening, was received by Bulgarian King Boris at 11:00 yesterday morning. He presented Boris with the German Golden Eagle Grand Cross, presented to the Bulgarian King by the German leader.

### Reasons for Suspension of French National Disaster Case Announced by French Minister of Justice

Vichy, 15th, Havas—Minister of Justice Barthélemy told a reporter for "Le Petit Parisien" that the suspension of the court session in Lyon was an extraordinary measure, without a doubt. However, this is an extraordinary period and a way to deal with extraordinary crises. At this time of world turmoil, our country is also facing a crisis, which forces us to take special steps. The jurisdiction of the court is to handle lawsuits, while the government is responsible for national security. The measures we have taken are for the sake of maintaining order. At the beginning of the court's trial, the government firmly believed that all the facts of the case would come to light. However, based on past events, this trial is limited to investigating the lack of our country's military preparedness. Since the trial is limited, the truth obtained is also limited. In fact, limited truth cannot be called truth. In this way, we would rather reopen the court in the future and conduct an unlimited trial. Moreover, when the Lyon court opened, the disputes of the defendants had just subsided, and then disputes arose again, causing chaos in the eyes and ears of the people of the country. Not only that, but the statements of some defendants, as well as the remarks of their defense lawyers and witnesses, often contain the nature of causing disputes between our country and foreign countries, which is also one of the reasons for the temporary suspension of the continuation of the trial.

Lyon, France, 15th, Havas—"Le Temps" recently published an editorial commenting on the postponement of the trial of the national disaster case by the Lyon Supreme Court, stating, "We believe that France and the public have developed a kind of indifferent mentality towards the complexity and irrelevance of this case. The responsibility for the defeat must be considered from both political and military aspects, and it is undeniable that the recent French cabinets have often adopted policies that are incompatible with the country's military capabilities. Therefore, conducting a more thorough investigation within a closer scope may provide better clues and discover the real perpetrators."

### Turkish Court Continues Trial of Papen Assassination Case

Turkish Capital, 16th, Havas—The trial of the assassination plot against German Ambassador to Turkey von Papen opened yesterday. The Soviet citizens accused, Konilov and Pavlov, requested that the Soviet lawyer Saenin from Moscow represent their defense, but the prosecutor refused on the grounds that it did not comply with national law. The presiding judge also rejected this "unreasonable request" and regarded it as Soviet interference in Turkish justice. The lawyer for the defendant Abdulrahman mentioned that his client was very remorseful and then read Papen's letter, which stated that he fell to the ground due to an explosion on the way to the embassy at 10:00, and saw the murderer being bombed, with blood and flesh flying everywhere. Papen stated in another letter that he saw Ducat's photo and confirmed that he had never met him. Papen continued that he often went to the embassy at the same time, and Ducat probably knew this. Two members of the French Embassy in Turkey also stated in person that they were also near the scene when the incident occurred and saw two young women running and shouting. A letter from the police authorities stated that the staff of the Toros Hotel proved that Ducat had lived in the hotel for 20 days and had not returned to the hotel after the assassination. They proved that the clothes at the scene belonged to Ducat. The police authorities also stated in another letter that Konilov went to the Turkish capital from Istanbul on January 15 of this year. The trial was suspended at noon. Before the suspension of the trial, the presiding judge discovered that a reporter from the Soviet News Agency was attempting to contact the Soviet citizens accused with signs and immediately ordered the Soviet reporter to leave the court.

### Shu Mountain Barbarian Caves

— Cheng

Shu is a mountainous region, and many of its major cities are built against the mountains. The reputation of the carved tomb caves on the peninsula at the mouth of the Jialing River is partly due to the help of these natural conditions. However, besides these man-made modern caves, Shu also possesses many ancient and peculiar stone caves, which, after countless years, have only gradually attracted attention in recent years. These are the so-called barbarian caves.

These barbarian caves are mostly built into cliffs beside mountains and rivers, with varying heights and sizes. The smaller ones have a height, width, and depth of only about two meters, while the larger ones can be dozens of meters deep and accommodate thousands of people. Their internal structures vary in complexity, and some are even divided into several small chambers. Therefore, it can be concluded that these caves were entirely carved out by humans in ancient times and are by no means naturally formed.

Many places in Sichuan Province have these barbarian caves, and those already discovered are mostly concentrated along the banks of several tributaries of the Yangtze River. Those along the Jialing River include Langzhong and Ba County; those along the Fu River include Mianyang; and those along the Min River include Chengdu, Leshan, Yibin, Wenchuan, and Xinjin. Among them, the barbarian caves in the Min River basin are the most numerous and elaborately constructed. As for the years in which they were carved, only a few caves recently discovered in Ba County have inscriptions that can be examined. Here, I quote a passage from the French scholar Victor Segalen's description of the Leshan barbarian caves:

"Ten miles north of Jiading North Gate, on the left side of the road to Yazhou, there is a cliff of beautiful purple-red sandstone, in which several caves have been carved... Their facades are very wide, occupying about fifty square meters, with two or three cave doors. Between the doors are square columns. Above the doors are wide lintels... One cave is eight meters wide and four meters deep. Although the facade is large, the interior decoration is still intact, and one can imagine its appearance when it was newly built. The carvings are extremely simple and discreet. The exterior decoration is excellent, and the interior design is also very harmonious... Its simplicity and scale can be said to have reached perfection." (See Feng Chengjun's translation of *Archaeological Notes on Western China*)

From this praise and admiration, one can get a glimpse of the exquisite craftsmanship of these barbarian caves. The attention that the Shu region's barbarian caves have attracted from the world is indeed due to the archaeological expedition to Sichuan by Segalen and his party in the early years of the Republic of China.

Based on the style of the carvings and lines of the barbarian caves, Segalen estimated that they were relics of the Han Dynasty. This view has recently been confirmed by the caves discovered near Ba County. In Beibei, Shapingba, Huijiayan, Jiushigang, Laijiaqiao, and other places in Ba County, barbarian caves have been successively discovered. In Jiushigang, the cave doors often have inscriptions above them, recording the years of construction, including Yongshou four years, Yanxi five years, Xiping four years, Xiping five years, Guanghe n years, etc. These are all regnal years of Emperors Huan and Ling of the Eastern Han Dynasty, corresponding to the latter half of the second century AD.

According to Sichuanese tradition, these caves were the dwellings of ancient barbarians, hence the name "barbarian caves." For many years, they did not attract the attention of archaeologists, and there are very few records in epigraphic books and county gazetteers. It was not until thirty or so years ago that Western archaeological teams discovered funerary objects and painted bricks in the so-called barbarian caves. Some caves even contained remnants of stone coffins. Judging from their volume, these caves could indeed accommodate one or more coffins. Therefore, it was confirmed that the so-called barbarian caves were not dwellings for the living but crypts for the dead, representing another form of burial besides ordinary inhumation, cremation, and even sky burial and water burial—cliff burial. This type of burial was prevalent in Egypt and Asia Minor. As for whether those buried in Sichuan cliff tombs were people from the Central Plains or local indigenous people, further factual evidence is needed. However, judging from the decorations and inscriptions of the cliff tombs that have been discovered, they are in the same style as Han Dynasty relics from various parts of the Central Plains. Therefore, it can be inferred that these cliff tombs were built under the influence of Central Plains culture. The Ba-Shu region, since Zhang Yi and Sima Cuo's management at the end of the Warring States period, had long been assimilated into China by the Eastern Han Dynasty. The number of people from the Central Plains who moved to Ba-Shu to settle down was also constant. Those buried in these cliff tombs were, at the very least, indigenous people who had been sinicized, and were by no means the so-called barbarians who had no connection with the Central Plains.

The cliff tomb system is nameless in China. Most of the tombs of the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors that are transmitted today are based on later generations' beliefs, and even the Zhou tombs in the Wei River may not be reliable. However, the method of using earthen mounds as tombs has been established since the Zhou Dynasty. Although there are distinctions between whether or not there are trees planted to mark the grave, various burial systems other than inhumation have disappeared from the Central Plains since the beginning of history. The cliff burial system was probably a custom of the primitive ethnic groups of Ba-Shu, which was adopted by the Han people who moved in later. Therefore, cliff burials were still very popular until the late Eastern Han Dynasty, and Central Plains-style decorations and carvings were added. However, these immigrants also brought in the inhumation system. Many Han tombs in the style of earthen mounds remain in the Shu region, and their ages are often not very far from those of the cliff burials that have been discovered. It can be seen that in the Shu region of the Han Dynasty, cliff burial and inhumation coexisted, and later gradually replaced by inhumation. As for whether the cliff burial system in Ba-Shu is related to this system in ancient West Asia, there is no definite proof at this time.

Digging caves on cliffs is certainly a difficult task, but these cemeteries are more durable than ordinary brick-and-earth tombs. In China, where wars were frequent, countless ancient tombs have been submerged, but these caves remain intact. After hiding coffins for many years, they were often used as dwellings by local poor people. At the end of the Song Dynasty, an hermit named Cheng Gongwang lived in them and researched. In recent years, they have also been used to supplement the lack of artificial caves, and their function is even better than some artificial trenches. It is indeed beyond the expectations of those who built them, and the Ba-Shu region can truly be proud of having the best caves in the world.

### Various Parties Planning Concrete Measures to Prepare for the Restoration of Nanyang Trade

Trade to Avoid Competition Between Businesses

Proposal to Organize a Joint-Stock Company

Currency Exchange Rate to be Determined

The restoration of trade between Shanghai and Nanyang has become increasingly concrete. The relevant authorities in Shanghai are actively preparing concrete measures to restore trade. A meeting was originally scheduled for the 14th of this month to discuss the issue of transport ships for Nanyang trade, methods of payment for goods, trade organizations, categories of controlled goods, and management bodies, and to exchange opinions from all parties. However, this meeting has been postponed due to various reasons. The various discussions and opinions from all parties are summarized below.

Yokohama Specie Bank Handles Exchange

The method of payment for goods seems to be based on a special yen system, using the special yen as the standard currency for transactions. According to observations, it may be based on the military scrip quotations in Shanghai, and the exchange value between currencies in Nanyang will be determined. The method of determination is based on the exchange value between the yen and Nanyang currencies (which has been decided and announced) and the exchange value between military scrip and reserve notes. As for the agency handling the exchange, due to the necessity of control, it may be limited to being handled centrally by the Shanghai branch of the Yokohama Specie Bank.

Joint Venture Company Specializing in Trade

Regarding the issue of trade organizations, Nanyang trade in Shanghai will be uniformly controlled in the future to avoid free competition between businesses in the same industry. It is said that the control mechanism should be that each industry should form an association to work together. In addition, some people suggest organizing a Sino-Japanese joint-stock company to specialize in Nanyang trade. The limited company should have a capital of at least 10 million yen, which will be apportioned by the relevant commercial firms. The amount of investment from the Chinese side will be limited to about 20 percent, with the remainder coming from Japanese businesses. There are also other opinions that a portion of the trade rights should be reserved for merchants from neutral countries in this organization.

Important Materials Must be Controlled

The categories of controlled goods are roughly all important items such as military resources, cotton textiles, silk textiles, raw silk, rice, coal, rubber, and sugar. Other ordinary materials can be traded freely by various commercial firms without restriction. The detailed categories of controlled goods can be specified at the meeting. For the guidance mechanism, the Shanghai side will select members from the relevant authorities to form the Nanyang Trade Management Committee to supervise it. In terms of transportation, the issue of ships is difficult to resolve. It is expected that a portion can be transported by Japanese ships, but most will rely on the ships of the Vietnam French Post Office Company. Currently, among the large ocean-going ships in the Far East, only French ships can be used besides Japanese ships. All of these are speculations from various parties, and the future trend of Nanyang trade can already be seen in general.

### Citibank Depositors to Withdraw Over 80% of Deposits

Third Withdrawal Starting Next Week

According to the *China Press*, a US newspaper, official news today (the 16th) indicates that Citibank in Shanghai will pay out the third batch of deposits to depositors on April 20th, next Monday. This batch of deposits accounts for 30% of the remaining balance on December 6th of last year, after deducting the first batch of 2,000 yuan. This is a parallel move to the payment of the third batch of deposits by HSBC and Mercantile Bank. It is reported that Citibank's third payment is equivalent to 60% of the remaining deposits of various accounts that have been frozen by the bank. After receiving this payment, the total amount of deposits withdrawn by depositors will exceed 80% of the remaining balance on December 6th of last year. After the second batch of deposits was withdrawn, Citibank depositors had transferred to open accounts at Mitsubishi Bank. Therefore, the third batch of deposits will be withdrawn from Mitsubishi Bank's accounts. The withdrawal rules are the same as those for the third batch. Nationals of non-belligerent countries can withdraw their entire deposit. Nationals of Allied countries can only withdraw 2,000 yuan each time.

Chase Bank Urges Opening of Safe Deposit Boxes

Many of Chase Bank's safe deposit boxes have already been opened by renters for inspection, but there are still many that have not been opened. The bank believes that the deadline is approaching quickly and cannot be delayed. For the benefit of renters, they are urged to go to open the boxes. If there are no valuables in the boxes, the keys should be returned immediately and the key deposit should be retrieved to complete the procedure.

### Today, Various Rice Shops Will Sell Corn

Increase Quantity of Imported Rice

Extend Sales Hours

According to a report by the Datong News Agency, the dates for rice shops in the two concessions to sell imported rice will remain Monday, Wednesday, and Saturday. However, the sales hours have been extended from 8:00 AM to 6:00 PM. Corn will still be sold on Fridays. Sales will be suspended on Sundays and Mondays and Thursdays. On the dates when imported rice is sold, half of the 395 rice shops will still handle sales. The quantity limits will also remain the same as before. Imported rice is limited to one liter per person, costing 2.9 yuan in national currency. Corn is limited to 1.5 liters per person, costing 2.2 yuan in national currency.

The Shanghai Municipal Council's Grain Management Committee has assigned imported rice to the rice shops for the nth time.

The quantity of imported rice has now been increased so that the sales hours of the rice shops can be extended. The increased quantity is an increase of two to ten bags per shop for rice shops in the French Concession, and an increase of five to fifty bags per shop for rice shops in the International Settlement. Therefore, based on the sales situation the day before yesterday (Wednesday), the supply has been more widespread. However, the police will still enforce queue numbering and strictly implement finger dyeing. The imported rice previously designated by the Shanghai Municipal Council's Grain Office to be from the Zhejiang Industrial Bank, Taikoo Wharf, and Roosevelt Wharf has been picked up by the rice shops since yesterday for sale on Saturday (18th). The quantity has been increased, so the sales hours will still be extended to 8:00 AM to 6:00 PM. The corn sales orders obtained on Monday and the payments made for corn extracted from Lihe Warehouses at 195 Suzhou Road have already been completed. All 395 rice shops in the two concessions can sell corn today.

### White Russian Unit of the French Police to be Inspected This Morning

According to a message announced by the French Municipal Council the night before last, the White Russian Unit of the French Police will hold an inspection at Gujiazhai Park (French Park) at 10:00 AM on the 17th of this month (today) to celebrate its tenth anniversary. The French Municipal Council's guard will also participate in the inspection. The medals awarded to members of the White Russian Unit in 1941 will be presented by French Consul General Magil at the inspection. A temporary platform will be built in the inspection field to accommodate the French expatriates in Shanghai who will attend the viewing.

Shenzhou Industrial Bank Opens

The preparation for the Shenzhou Industrial Bank at 178 Tianjin Road in Shanghai has been completed, and it will open today. The chairman of the board, Sun Shupei, the general manager, Wang Chenglie, the manager, Tu Hengli, the deputy manager, Zhu Junrong, and the assistant managers, Yuan Ruixian and Hu Zhian, are all well-known figures in the financial community, and it is expected that the bank will develop successfully in the future. It is heard that the bank has special preferential measures for deposit interest rates.

### A Tour of the Orphanage with a Proactive Spirit

Our Reporter Visits the New Pu Yu Tang

Outside the short wall of the foreign cemetery on Sanma Road, a carriage was parked along the sidewalk on the south side. The style of the carriage was very archaic, with a dark, rectangular carriage body resembling a giant money chest in an old-fashioned store. Several round windows were opened on all sides, protected by iron bars. The faded green window curtains could be seen through the gaps in the windows. The four wheels, like the wheels of a Japanese car thirty years ago, were very exposed and sturdy. At a glance, it could be seen that the owner of the carriage must be very economical and conservative.

Four of us together, led by the old coachman whose age and clothing were perfectly in harmony with the carriage, boarded the vehicle. With laughter, each of us occupied a corner. After sitting down, we looked through the window holes at the few trees in the cemetery. Under the wind and rain, the branches of the trees were constantly swaying. Raindrops hit the carriage windows, making a slight rustling rhythm.

This day—April 14th—it was raining, and the weather was much cooler. The brown horse pulled the carriage from the concession all the way to Guohuo Road in Nanshi.

The scenery along the way was initially very lively, with many shops on both sides. Even though it was raining, pedestrians were still following one another. After about twenty minutes, the situation changed. In several desolate piles of rubble, there was no "sign of human activity." The rain was still falling lightly, and everyone could not help but feel depressed.

After winding through several small streets and several ruins, a gray wall suddenly appeared in front of us. The horse also seemed particularly happy and increased its speed. Our carriage had stopped at the gate of the New Pu Yu Tang.

Passing through bustle...desolation...arriving at another realm!

It seemed as if we had gone back a year. During this period last year—also in the bright and beautiful spring—this newspaper made some meager efforts to appeal to all sectors for financial assistance for the New Pu Yu Tang. The vast readership of our newspaper and the enthusiastic people from all walks of life who sympathized with us generously donated money and collected goods for them. For more than ten months, this image has always remained in our minds. We feel that society is not cold-hearted, and there are many people around us who are sympathetic and willing to help those who are truly in need. The donations from all sides to the New Pu Yu Tang and the achievements of the Shen Bao Scholarship Fund are at least powerful proof of this.

Standing in front of us now were the three Mu Mu from the Catholic Charity Society—the Grand Mu Mu, the Second Grand Mu Mu, and S Mu Mu. They and the other seven or eight Mu Mu are the maintainers of the New Pu Yu Tang's undertaking. They are also the saviors and nannies of thousands of elderly, infirm, disabled, and orphaned children. The labor of the enthusiastic people in society is used under their leadership.

After resting in the reception room for a while, we began our tour.

The New Pu Yu Tang is such a vast organization that we only realized how difficult it is to manage after we were there.

The site covers almost 120 mu, and there are quite a few buildings. In terms of the environment, it carries a proactive and forward-looking spirit in a solemn atmosphere. From the overall layout, the flowers and trees are lush, and the houses are spacious and can be called quiet and elegant. Everywhere, we saw statues of gods and crucifixes. We couldn't resist feeling the religious solemnity and compassion, and the dedication and caution of those in charge as soon as we entered.

In such a quiet and clean environment, we first blessed those unfortunate orphans, the infirm, and the disabled. They can continue their precious lives in this place, which can be said to be a great fortune in misfortune. On the one hand, we also felt that for such a large group, putting aside the personnel, we could not help but worry about them financially. If it were not for the continuous assistance of enthusiastic people, seeing such a place would make people feel particularly uncomfortable.

Because the location is so large and the organization is quite complex, we "took a quick look" and followed the three Mu Mu on a large circle. Now we can only briefly describe the general impression.

The New Pu Yu Tang is divided into an orphanage, a nursery, a nursing home, and also accommodates disabled orphans, poor and sick refugees, and provides free medical treatment. Since its opening, it has been in operation for thirty years, and has accommodated no less than 100,000 poor men and women. In the past, an average of more than 3,500 people were cared for in the hall every day, and the total number of medical treatments and medicines given each year reached more than 2.4 million (according to last year's statistics).

Recently, due to economic difficulties, the number of people admitted has been reduced repeatedly, but the number of elderly, infirm, and disabled people who cannot be dispersed remains close to a thousand. Approximately 50 percent are orphans, 30 percent are elderly and infirm, and the rest are disabled and homeless victims.

"The Grand Mu Mu said in the morning that no one would be admitted today no matter what, but when she looked at night, she had admitted seven or eight more people!" said S Mu Mu.

"Then where did they come from?" we couldn't help but ask.

"Some homeless people have been sleeping at the gate of our hall for a long time. If you give them money, they don't want it. They would rather die outside the gate. The Grand Mu Mu has a soft heart and has no choice but to take them in!" S Mu Mu expressed helplessness.

From the above words, we can imagine that the New Pu Yu's funding is difficult to be sufficient. If there were no donations for a day, these thousands of elderly, infirm, and disabled people would be in danger of their lives.

We first visited the fourteen- and fifteen-year-old girls making lace and tea cloths. The room was spacious, and the air and light were sufficient. Pieces of cloth, thread, and yarn were displayed on the tables. One Mu Mu was inside instructing them on their work. When they saw us enter, they stopped working, stood up, and bowed. Everyone was polite.

After making a circle, the Grand Mu Mu pointed to two girls and said to us:

"Ah, they are going to be brides!" (The Grand Mu Mu spoke French, which S Mu Mu translated.)

They were a little embarrassed and lowered their heads without saying a word. They were making their wedding clothes.

We knew that they were all orphans who had come in as infants or young children. After being raised and educated by these nuns, they grew up and chose to marry. The great "maternal love" filled our minds when we heard the Grand Mu Mu's words.

Mr. L, to express his congratulations to the two future brides, took out some money and gave it to them to buy some things they liked. We all felt a sense of joy!

Later, we visited the bedrooms, dining hall, infirmary, and pharmacy. Everything was well-equipped and well-arranged. The four words "clean, practical, and sincere" can sum it up.

Four- and five-year-old younger brothers and sisters, even if they were not growing up in wealthy families, would be loved by everyone. It's a pity that there are forty or fifty "little angels" in front of us who have not experienced the love of their own flesh and blood since they came into this world. But now, they have food and clothing. Some of their faces are round, like the little treasures in the readers' homes. Although the clothes they wear are donated from all sides, such as woolen sweaters donated from France and rubber shoes from a certain rubber factory, wearing them makes everyone lively and lovely. How could one not love them?

We watched them perform.

S Mu Mu led them in facial expression exercises, singing songs and performing various body postures, which were very skilled and very interesting. Then came the silent forest exercises and freehand exercises, all of which made people believe that the training they received was very complete.

A little brother about four years old came to express his gratitude to us. He stood very upright and spoke loudly, expressing how he and his companions were 120,000 times grateful to the readers of this newspaper for their enthusiastic donations last year.

"...It's a pity that we don't have parents...The little birds in the trees are still fed by their old birds...Fortunately, we came to the New Pu Yu Tang...Fortunately, Shen Bao appealed for us last year...Bless the donors..."

We would like to thank the readers of this newspaper on behalf of these younger brothers and sisters for their assistance.

They took the liberty of giving us very beautiful handkerchiefs. In fact, as Mr. L said, please ask the children to thank the Mu Mu who raised them and the enthusiastic people in society who donated to them.

We saw these many lovely children and thought about what would have become of these children if many people had not donated last year. No wonder the Mu Mu were so moved in this environment that they frequently wiped their eyes with handkerchiefs.

A "Little Dwarf"

They were eating. We arrived at about 10:45, and it had been more than an hour since we had arrived. The Mu Mu personally served them rice and vegetables, salted vegetable soup, tofu, and Xian rice. The very young ones who couldn't hold a spoon were fed by female servants.

They ate with relish, and we also had a lot of fun looking around at this time.

There were many sick abandoned babies lying in cradles, their lives hanging by a thread. Their fate had not yet been decided.

A child with a particularly developed head and a very short body, who was already seven years old, looked only about three years old. He was constantly coming and going with an Italian Mu Mu.

"This is this Mu Mu's treasure," S Mu Mu told us.

Even such a strangely shaped and lonely child was loved by someone!

Finally, we also saw the nursing home and the residents' homes. Because it was already two o'clock, we said goodbye to the three Mu Mu and stepped back into the noisy area in the sound of horse hooves.

A Respectful Message to Enthusiastic People

The Bible says: "It is more blessed to give than to receive." The lives of these elderly, infirm, and disabled people are entrusted to the enthusiastic people in society. May everyone always think of them.

### Three Robbers Break into Jinmen Hotel Room and Loot

More than 40,000 Gold Yuan in Cash and Jewelry Stolen

At 10:45 AM yesterday, three men, all well-dressed, suddenly appeared at room 604 of the Jinmen Hotel, No. 104 Jing'an Temple Road, Public Concession. Unexpectedly, the three men were actually robbers. After entering the room, they revealed their ferocious looks, brandished weapons, and threatened the occupants not to make any noise. They then proceeded to search and loot, taking all the cash and jewelry such as rings carried by the guests in the room. They then swaggered downstairs and disappeared without a trace. Afterwards, the guest reported the incident to the police station, requesting the arrest of the gang. It is said that the amount stolen from each guest was very large, totaling over 45,000 Gold Yuan.

### Theft of Property from St. Peter's Catholic Church, Several Virgin Girls Stabbed

Plumber Frequently Entered and Exited, Familiar with the Inside Situation, French Police Station Drove Around to Apprehend, Shopkeeper Implicated

St. Peter's Church at No. 37 Kai Zhu Tang Street in the French Concession is a Catholic church, and Xiaoming Girls' Middle School is located within it. All repairs inside the church were entrusted to Cai Asan, the owner of a sheet metal shop at No. 57 Avenue Edward VII. Zhang Bingsheng (from Jiangbei, 38 years old), a shop assistant, frequently entered and exited the church, was familiar with the situation inside, and knew that the storage rooms of the virgin girls were not locked. He then suddenly had evil thoughts. On the evening of February 21 of this year, he sneaked into the church and stole all the private savings of the virgin girls stored in the drawers, totaling 800 yuan in reserve notes. He also stole 26 sheets of lead skin worth 7,270 yuan, sold them to various hardware stores, and used the money to enjoy a life of leisure. After the theft, St. Peter's Church reported it to the French Police Station, which was investigating the case. Unexpectedly, Zhang returned twice and was discovered by five or six Chinese and Western virgin girls in the church. Just as they were about to report him to the police to arrest him, Zhang drew a murder weapon, an iron awl, and stabbed them, taking the opportunity to escape. When the priest of the church heard about this, he was furious and ordered the police station to arrest the culprit. The French Police Station immediately dispatched Shao Guanrong and a large number of detectives to search for him everywhere. It was not until a few days ago that Cai Asan's wife lured Zhang from Zhabei to the concession, arrested him, and took him to the police station for detention and investigation.

They arrested Yang Shubao, a native of Wuxi, and took him to the police station. According to his confession, the organization that manufactured this counterfeit liquor was organized by his brother-in-law, Zhang Wenkui. The detectives then went to No. 23 Tiansheng Lane, Xuehuali Road, to arrest Zhang, but he had already fled upon hearing the news. Zhang and Yang were temporarily detained pending further investigation.

### West Qing Volleyball Game Yesterday, Zhen Dan Won, White Team Suffered Defeat, Soviet Union Beat Russian侨 Four to One

The fourth act of the 14th West Qing Volleyball Invitational Tournament was held in the West Qing Gymnasium the night before last. Because two Chinese teams participated in the game, the audience was not reduced. The White team, which was made up of all Chinese players, was defeated again by the giants. The Sino-Western mixed team of Zhen Dan defeated Peide two to one. The Soviet Union team in Group A defeated Russian僑 four to one, avenging their loss last Monday. There will be three more games tonight. In addition to two games in Group B, the Hai Qing women's team will be invited to perform against the West Qing women's team.

The generals of the giants were all well-built, and the generals of the White team were inferior in comparison. The White team only scored four points in the first game. The White team tried to struggle in the second game and once reached nine to eight. However, they were unable to recover. The giants scored five points in a row, and the White team lost two to zero. In the next game, Zhen Dan took the first game. Peide pulled back one game. In the final final, Zhen Dan won fifteen to nine, and the summary was two to one. In the historical drama, the Russian僑 team was not successful and lost eight to fifteen. In the second game, the Russian僑 team won steadily and the score rose sharply, pulling back one city. In the third game, the Soviet Union relied on Releyi, Wan Qin, and Rolov's swift spikes, making it difficult for the Russian僑 to block. As a result, the Soviet Union beat Russian僑 four to one. The results of the competition are as follows: French Police -洛人 (B) at 6:20, Hai Qing - West Qing (Women) at 7:00 PM, Russian Police - Giant (B) at 7:45 PM.

### Shangsi Xiuxi (Spring Purification Ritual)

— Liu Tang

March 3rd is Shangsi, today is indeed the third day of the third month of the Xia calendar.

What is Shangsi? It is the Si day in the first ten days of March. However, March 3rd of each year is not necessarily a Si day, so why is it still called Shangsi? This is because since the Wei (Three Kingdoms) Dynasty, only the third day was used, not the Si day, and it began to deviate from the original meaning of Shangsi.

Shangsi Xiuxi can still be passed down in society today, thanks to Wang Xizhi's Lanting Xiuxi. The Lanting Preface is not only smooth and emotional, but also regarded as the master of calligraphy. Therefore, its writing is more prominent, its events are more obvious, and the name of Shangsi is relied upon to be passed down and not replaced.

The Shangsi banquet was most prosperous before the Tang and Song Dynasties. Emperor Dezong of Tang once asked Li Bi, "In previous generations, on Shangsi and the ninth day of the ninth month, there were large banquets. And the Cold Food Festival often coincided with Shangsi. I want to take March as a famous festival and take myself as ancient, what is the possibility?" Bi requested that the second day of the first month be the Zhonghe Festival, and he gave the ministers and relatives rulers, which were called measuring. The people used blue bags to hold hundreds of grains, melon and fruit seeds, and asked each other for gifts, which was called Xian Shengzi. The neighborhood let Yichun wine to worship the Gou Mang God and pray for a good harvest. The officials presented agricultural disasters to show their foundations. Emperor Dezong was very pleased and ordered it to be the same as Shangsi and the ninth day, as the three festival seasons. It can be seen that Shangsi is a festival for banquets and Cold Food Festival is a time for sacrifices, so sometimes they are in sync, making people unhappy. Therefore, Emperor Dezong wanted to choose another good festival in the spring, and he had good reasons to make himself ancient. Although the Song Dynasty did not set the Shangsi Festival for viewing; however, every spring, they would enjoy flowers, fish, play music, and drink in the back garden, which was called Quyin, and was also the meaning of Qushui Liushang.

How did Shangsi begin? Not only do modern people want to ask, but ancient people also wanted to know its origin. Emperor Wu of Jin once asked Zhi Chu about the meaning of Qushui on the third day. Yu replied:

"During the reign of Emperor Zhang of the Han Dynasty, Xu Zhao of Pingyuan gave birth to three daughters at the beginning of the third month. All three died on the third day. The villagers thought it was strange, so they invited them to the water's edge to wash away their evil spirits, and then they used water to float the wine cups. This is the origin of the meaning."

Emperor Wu of Jin said, "If it is as you say, then it is not a good thing." Shu Xi said, "You are too young to know. In the past, the Duke of Zhou built Luoyi and used flowing water to float wine, so the lost poem says, 'The feathered cup follows the waves.' Also, King Zhao of Qin set up wine on the riverbank on the third day and saw a golden man holding a water-hearted sword, saying, 'Let the king have Western Xia, so he will dominate the princes.' Therefore, it was established as Qushui, and the two Han dynasties followed each other as a grand gathering."

According to the Song Dynasty history (Song of the Southern Dynasties), there are some discrepancies, and Xu Zhao is called Guo Yu, saying that he gave birth to two daughters on the first Chen of the third month, and one daughter on Shangsi. In the two days, all three daughters died, and the common people thought it was a great taboo. On this day of this month, they did not dare to stay at home. They all prayed and purified themselves on the flowing water, which was called Xi Ci. They divided the flowing cups and formed Qushui. The historian's note: (This historian is the historian who wrote the history of Jin and Song) The Zhou Li female witch is in charge of bathing and purifying every year, such as the water on Shangsi in March. bathing refers to bathing with fragrant herbs. The Han poem says: "The custom of the Zheng Kingdom, on the waters of the Zhen and Wei Rivers on Shangsi in March, summoning souls and continuing spirits, holding orchids and brushing away bad luck." This has been a long time ago, not the legacy of Guo Yu. The customs of crossing the water, according to the calendar, "in the late spring, the emperor begins to ride a boat." Cai Yong's chapter says: "The Yang Qi is warm, and the fish are coming. They will be used to present to the sleeping temple, so they ride a boat on the famous river." Analects, bathing in the Yi in late spring, from top to bottom, there has been this ritual in ancient times. Now (this now refers to Yong's time) Shangsi in March, bathing on the water's edge, probably means this." In addition, Emperor Ming of Wei set up Liubei Stone Gou Yan Qunchen in the south of Tianyuan Pond, and the Western Duke of Jin Haixi Zhongshan later had Liubei Quxi, such as the Han book bathing in on August, which was indeed Mid-Autumn Festival.

The above is a collection of records from the history of the Wei, Jin, and Six Dynasties to prove the origin of Shangsi, which is mostly nothing more than this.

However, the Lanting Xiuxi is the only one that has been passed down for centuries, and it has been passed down by people. After the Jin Dynasty moved east, the famous scholars abandoned the capital dust and admired the beautiful mountains and rivers of Kuaiji, such as Xie An, Sun Chuo, Li Chong, Xu Xun, and Zhi Dun, who were crowned with writing and righteousness, and Wang Xizhi, all built houses here. The so-called Qunxian Bizi in the Lanting Preface refers to the thirty-two people of Xie An, Sun Chuo, and Wei Pang. Shaocheng Xianji refers to the nine sons of the Wang family, Ning Zhi, Huan Zhi, Xuan Zhi, and Xi Zhi. The preface was written by Xizhi: Xizhi's writing was not as good as Yu Yi at first, but it was wonderful in his later years. Yi sighed deeply and praised it as "radiant as a god," and his admiration can be known. The ink was loved by Emperor Taizong of Tang and buried in Zhaoling. The one passed down in later generations is the best one rubbed from the Dingzhou Stele, and the fake ones are piled up. My hometown's former sage, Cha Chubai, has textual research in Delou Miscellaneous Notes. The gentleman's poems and writings are the Emperor Shengzu's fishing Fu poem in the South Pond, which left the Middle Official to Xuan Zhao's fisherman, Cha Hanlin.

"The Xi Preface is the masterpiece of Right Army. It was passed down to the monk Zhiyong for seven generations (a descendant of Xizhi, who is passed down to this day in true Cao Qianziwen). Yong passed it on to his disciple Biancai. Emperor Taizong of Tang took it, more than two hundred and sixty years away from Yonghe Guichou. Soon, he was buried in Zhaoling, and the true trace was lost. In the early Tang Dynasty, many good writers caressed the book, but Ouyang Shuigeng (Xun) advocated the truth and carved stones in the ban. During the Stone Jin Dynasty, the Khitans returned and fell into Dingwu. In the Qingli period of the Song Dynasty, the stele came out among the people, and Jigu recorded that it was not another book. During the Xining period, Xue Shizheng's father and son began to publish two books separately to replace the original stele. On Tuan, Liu, Dai, Zuo, and Tian, five characters, one or two strokes were lost as a sign, and they often walked in the world. After crossing the south, thousands of stones were copied and engraved, and errors were passed down and gradually lost their old ones. Only the five characters are not damaged and the calligraphy still exists in the style of the rate of change, which is true. Mi Nangong got it, but Chu Henan's copy. It is said that the real book of Dingwu was already hard to come by in the Song Dynasty." According to the Zhenji of the Lanting Preface, it was seen again in the late Tang Dynasty due to the theft of Zhaoling, which I learned from reading the history of the Five Dynasties, Wen Tao Zhuan said:

"Tao extensively excavated the Tang tombs in the territory, and Zhaoling was the most solid. Tao went down from the underground path and saw the palaces and buildings were magnificent, not different from the human world. In the middle was the main bedroom, the east and west wing rooms, the stone bed, and the iron box in the stone box. They all contained the books of the previous generations. Zhong Wang's handwriting, paper, and ink were as new. Tao took them all and passed them on to the human world." This description proves that the ink of Lanting was not buried in Zhaoling for a long time, but after this great chaos, I don't know where it fell; or it was destroyed again by the war.

On this day last year, my classmate Ju Hengfu and I gathered classmates and peers from the same town, Zhu Xiaoqin, Shi Shengzu, Meng Wangqu, He Dekun, Zhu Jianshan, Tang Baisen, Zhou Wusan, Chen Yisheng, Wang Weigeng, etc. for a banquet at the Xin Xin Restaurant, and sent an invitation. Hengfu is outstanding in writing. Although he abandoned his career and went into business early, he still has the writing style of his youth. The invitation said:

"When we were young, we were as close as peach and plum blossoms; at this time, when we are about to know our fate, we look forward to green pines and cypresses. At the time of the turbulent Yellow Emperor, in a world where black and white are confused; it is rare to have old friends in our youth, and we gather together happily; it is just that worldly affairs are clear and free, and we can steal a day of leisure. On this auspicious day of Shangsi, we narrate the events of the Lanting Xiuxi; we use the fake banquet to drink a little, and we make a toast..." I plan to record the event, and only record the traces of the Hongxue, but I dare not write. Now, on the auspicious day of Shangsi, looking back at the past, a year has passed in a hurry, which shows that the style of Shangsi Xiuxi has not been abandoned.

### Government Bond Market Is Varied

Some Cut Losses, Some Resell, Some Cover Shorts, Some Reverse Longs, Retreating Fast, Advancing Sharply, Breaking Through Two Levels and Rising Significantly

The unofficial market for government bonds was initially very excited yesterday, but then suddenly fell sharply. It was still the same news as last time, but sellers have changed their approach in order to avoid being noticed and to confuse people. Although there were many sales, there were still considerable purchases. Class C even broke through the 60 yuan mark. Due to different choices, various market prices were distorted again. The difference between Class D and Class C was slightly smaller, at five and a half yuan. The difference between Class E and Class C was even greater, at three yuan and six jiao. It can be seen that there are particularly many shorts for Class E, and there will inevitably be a squeeze when they are covered in the future. At the opening of the market yesterday, Hongxing bought in large quantities, and people were excited. There were few sellers on the table. Class C was raised to 61 yuan and six jiao. At this time, it hovered for a long time, rising and falling by one or two jiao. Less than ten minutes before the close, Tongkang suddenly dumped a large amount for a certain account. Within a few minutes, Class C broke through two levels, breaking one yuan and breaking 60 yuan. As a result, the general floating longs had to cut their positions in pain, such as Yongchang, Runde, Dechang, Hongda, Datong, Yuanshunheng, Xinhua, and Shuntai, etc., either cutting longs or reselling. Tongkang alone sold nearly one million yuan. Hongxing Lianhe and Hu Heji bought in a surge, either covering shorts or reversing longs. Other companies such as Renfeng, Dejiang, Wuhe, Xinjihua, Yichang, and Runli also bought in. However, according to the closing price, there were no sellers afterwards. This kind of temporary price drop has nothing to do with the overall purpose of the government bond itself. Those who retreat fast also advance sharply. The general mentality is still mostly excited. As a result, market prices fell again by three or four jiao to one yuan and six jiao. The turnover was about 1.4 to 1.5 million yuan. A summary table is listed below. Category Highest Lowest Closing Price Compared to the Previous Day Unified A 68.00 67.00 67.20 down 0.30 Unified B 62.00 60.80 60.80 down 0.40 Unified C 61.60 59.60 59.70 down 1.15 Unified D 55.60 54.00 54.20 down 0.65 Unified E 58.20 56.10 56.10 down 1.60

### Ewo Cotton Mill Stocks

—Most Trading, Also Sharply Rising—

Yesterday, foreign stocks rose sharply again. A total of 20,100 shares were traded. Ewo Cotton Mill was the most traded, with a total of 3,600 shares. The price rose from 34 yuan to 35 yuan, and finally to 34 yuan and seven jiao, up one yuan and two jiao. 2,000 shares of Sino-British, from 11 yuan cattle to 13 yuan, up one yuan and six jiao. 1,500 shares of China Textile, 16 yuan and five or six jiao, also up one yuan and six jiao. 4,000 shares of Paper Industry, nine yuan and three or five jiao, up half a yuan. 2,500 shares of Ewo Beer, up five jiao, to nine yuan and two or three jiao. 600 shares of British Union, 26 yuan. 1,000 shares of Reclamation, 33 yuan, up one yuan. 2,500 shares of Yeguang, from 23 yuan and seven five to 24 yuan and a half. 500 shares of Xiangtai Timber, 27 yuan and two five and 27 yuan. 200 shares of Jardine Matheson, 60 yuan and five jiao and 61 yuan. 200 shares of Electric Power Preferred, 167 yuan. 1,000 shares of Galendan, one yuan and one jiao. 500 shares of Langgezhi, 17 yuan and a half, up one yuan. The rest were not traded.

### Chinese Stocks Tend to Be Flat and Weak

Yesterday, the trading of Chinese stocks was not strong. Only Wing On Company's stock rose by two and a half jiao to 47 yuan and a half. Most of the rest fell. Xin Xin, 74 yuan. China Underwear, 21 yuan. The new price of Xinya was between 31 yuan and seven five and 32 yuan. Zhongfa (new), around 53 yuan, down one yuan and a half. Wuzhou (new), 185 yuan traded.

### Rice Prices Are Too Expensive and Few People Inquire

National rice is in a state of having a market but no sales. Although it has been encouraged day by day, yesterday it was rumored that due to the spring rain, the mindset was firm, and the asking price continued to be high. Early and late rice in the French Concession once asked for 440 yuan, and in the British Concession, 460 yuan. However, the price was too expensive, and shops and stores suddenly felt that it was not easy to sell. Food customers also had no intention of buying rice, so although the asking price was high, it could not be realized. Later, they had to return to a lower price. As a result, the French Concession still sold for 434 yuan to 430 yuan, and the British Concession sold for 455 yuan to 450 yuan. Compared with the previous dynasty, it can be said that it is similar, without much rise or fall.

### Coarse Grains Are Thriving Again

Yesterday, the trading of coarse grains turned slightly active. The stores in this street were all in good sales, and the demand was quite greedy. The market showed a beautiful color, and all goods were consistently thriving. The items opened included ten bags of Tianjin green beans, priced at 220 yuan; thirty bags of Pudong dou beans, priced at 222 yuan; twenty bags of Pinghu dou beans, priced at 225 yuan; seventy-five bags of Chongming sand silkworms, priced at 142 yuan and a half; fifty bags of fork sand red, priced at 200 yuan; forty bags of Taicang red beans, priced at 199 yuan; twenty bags of Wujiang Jianqing, priced at 196 yuan; thirty bags of Mingguang red grain, priced at 137 yuan; more than one hundred bags of Wuhu corn, priced at 143 yuan to 140 yuan; seven hundred pieces of Qingzhong soybean cake, priced at 38 yuan or nine yuan; five hundred pieces of Feizi soybean cake's November stack list, priced at 43 yuan and a half; and six thousand pieces of Shengji soybean cake's April new stack list, priced at 52 yuan.

The unofficial market for bran has stopped being tired and turned firm, because the market stock has decreased and sellers are very rare. Yesterday, two hundred bags of Sanxin bran were opened, and the price was shouted high to 97 yuan.

### The Market Will Reopen, and a Frenzy of Collecting Spot Yarn Has Suddenly Arisen

The price of cotton yarn in the market has risen again. This is because cotton trading in Shanghai, which had been suspended since December 8th of last year, has recently been approved by the authorities to reopen for business on May 1st. Cotton yarn and cotton cloth are both changed to units of ten pieces, and all values are based on reserve notes. Therefore, people are encouraged, and everyone is collecting spot yarn to prepare for future trading. It is also said that all Chinese yarns can be delivered. 42-count Blue Phoenix is 9,650 yuan, and the closing price is 9,900 yuan. 60-count Five Sons is 19,500 yuan. 60-count Double Horse is 22,000 yuan. 42-count Color Ball is 9,200 yuan. 32-count Immortal Peach is 9,450 to 9,750 yuan. 20-count Blue Phoenix is 5,400 to 5,700 yuan. 20-count Moon Harp is 4,900 to 5,050 yuan. 20-count Sunlight is 5,300 yuan. 20-count Abundant Harvest is 5,150 to 5,300 yuan. 20-count Double Horse is 4,720 to 4,850 yuan. 20-count Double Globe is 4,880 yuan. 10-count Red Double Horse is 3,720 to 3,850 yuan. 10-count Party Army is 3,700 to 3,800 yuan. 10-count Bao Yi is 3,500 to 3,600 yuan. The initial opening price for 20-count Double Horse Factory Singles was 3,850 yuan, and it hovered around the 3,900 yuan mark for quite some time. Near the closing, it was heard that the spot yarn situation was active, and short sellers were scrambling to cover their positions. The market rose sharply, breaking through 4,000 yuan, and the closing price was 4,010 yuan.

### Coarse Cloth is Scarce, and Demand from Dong Pi is Very Strong

Factory cloth prices rose yesterday due to the increase in Dong Pi, and 16-pound Earth coarse cloth was sold for 125 yuan in the morning, and 220 yuan in the afternoon, and it was still in short supply. 12-pound Earth fine cloth was 195 to 200 yuan, also rising about 5 yuan per piece. Dapeng rose from 193 yuan to 198 yuan, and Fugui was 185 yuan. Chick Sheling did 298 yuan in the morning and 300 yuan in the afternoon with buyers. Longevity Silk Cloth was 6 yuan and 45 cents, and Wan Benli was 6 yuan and 25 cents. The total transaction volume on this street reached more than 500 pieces.

Dong cloth yesterday, due to the news of the reopening of the exchange, demand for mid- and low-grade fine cloth was very strong. Therefore, the new single price for Longtou fine cloth, after opening at 229 yuan, saw a slight fluctuation and then rose. The noon closing rose to 236 yuan. In the afternoon, the opening buying interest was even stronger, rising sharply to 239.5 yuan. However, ultimately due to lackluster actual sales, it fell again, and the evening closing was 235 yuan. However, this was a sharp increase of 7 yuan compared to the previous day's market. Color Ball fine cloth was 212 yuan, and Baby Fine Cut was 189 yuan. The rebound in Four Gentlemen Biji was also strong, rising to 7 yuan and 21 cents for October to December, and 7 yuan and 15 cents for Red Singles.

### Steamed Gold Continued to Decline, Once Reaching 18,000 Yuan

The spot gold black market continued to weaken, once falling below the 18,000 yuan mark, entirely due to a certain gold shop continuously selling off. Transactions increased slightly, totaling about 200 taels. The initial transaction price in the morning was 18,200 yuan, slightly lower than the previous day's price. A certain cash gold shop, along with silver shops and securities firms, sold off, and the price gradually decreased by 300 yuan. At 11:20, the lowest was 17,900 yuan, when a certain silver shop and another securities firm began to absorb the supply, and it began to rebound. There were buyers at 18,005 yuan, and sellers wanted 18,100 yuan, more than 200 yuan less than the previous day. It has been lower for three consecutive days, a total of more than 600 yuan lower. Silver shop jewelry, Da Xin and other shops still quote 1,900 yuan per tael (purchases are reduced by 200 yuan). Fine silver is 18 yuan, and the black market price is 13 yuan and 35 cents. Silver coins also fell close to 8 yuan with no transactions. The discount rate for checks is between 20 yuan and 25 yuan per thousand yuan, showing a slight decrease. The Shanghai Money Guild's lending rate remains unchanged at 7 points.

### Military Notes Continue to Fall

Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw British and American gold pounds remain unchanged, the former at 430 yuan and the latter at 440 yuan. US dollar notes were around 30 yuan. Hong Kong notes continued to rise to 4 yuan and 40 cents, with large notes decreasing slightly by 10 cents. Military notes opened in the morning at 7 yuan and 25 cents, then retreated to 1 yuan and 7 cents, and finally to 7 yuan and 19 cents, slightly lower than the previous day by 6 cents.

### Walnuts Sell Actively and Prices Rise

Walnuts, due to recently active sales, the market has tightened, with top-grade walnuts rising by 30 to 40 yuan, and ordinary walnuts rising by 10 yuan. Yesterday's market saw hand-picked peaches sell for 320 yuan, Changping peaches for 300 yuan, and Southern peaches for 220 yuan. Peach kernels are cheaper, still selling for 750 yuan.

### Dried Lily Bulbs Are Hoarded

Dried lily bulbs are being hoarded because arrivals are scarce, and most of the stocks on the market are stubbornly unsold, so the market is very tight. Yesterday's market called for another increase of 20 to 30 yuan, and it was heard that hoarders were inquiring, so although the supply is small, there is ultimately no hope of loosening.

### Cheap Cigarettes Are Constantly Distributed, and Market Prices Are Easy to Fall and Difficult to Rise

The cigarette market is difficult to enter a good situation because Yongtai is constantly distributing cheap goods to designated fellow dealers for sale. The Japanese manufacturer's products of various brands are also in the process of handling the distribution procedures, which will be completed soon, and seven companies will be designated to distribute them to the general sales in Shanghai. Therefore, people's minds continue to be tired, and prices show a soft trend. The opening price for Great Britain brand is 9,600 yuan per case, Old Knife brand is 8,700 yuan, Pin Hai brand is 6,000 yuan, Little Fairy brand is 5,600 yuan, Five Flowers brand is 5,500 yuan, Japanese Tobacco Golden Gun brand is 2,400 yuan, Golden Building brand is 2,450 yuan, Red Rose brand is 1,950 yuan, and Quanlu brand is 2,800 yuan. Looking at the future market, the selling prices of various goods are easy to fall and difficult to rise because hoarders generally seek to sell quickly, so the market presents a situation of oversupply.

Artificial Silk Sees Widespread Selling

Yesterday's artificial silk market wanted to rise but stopped. The morning opening price for 120 Tianqiao with light small boxes was 8,750 yuan, and for 120 Jin 半光 large boxes it was 8,730 yuan, slightly lower than the previous day by 110 yuan. 75 Jin 半光 small boxes were 8,130 yuan. The market showed a weak trend, and those with large quantities of goods tried their best to push up prices, and buying interest increased again, rising to 8,400 yuan. Soon after, it was heard that large accounts would release large quantities, and retail investors sold fiercely, and the market declined, falling back to 8,190 yuan.

### Longan (3)

— Gao Jiannong

It can be seen that longan is not a specialty of Fujian Province, and even if it is produced there, it is only because of its proximity to the water, having been transmitted from Guangdong Province. Moreover, even if we talk about the longan produced in Fujian Province, Xu Yuanhu in his "Complete Treatise on Agricultural Administration" only broadly states: "It exists in Fuzhou, Xinghua, and Quanzhou." He Qiaoyuan's "Book of Fujian" cites Zhang Yue's "Gazetteer of Hui'an County" - located slightly north of Quanzhou - saying: "The larger ones are called 'Longan' (Dragon Eye), the next are called 'Ruyan' (Entering Eye), and the smaller ones are called 'Guiyan' (Ghost Eye). The common people do not distinguish them and call them all 'Longan' (Cage Eye)." He also cites Chen Maoren's "Miscellaneous Records of Quannan" - which is not in the current Commercial Press Collection - saying: "Longan is sweet and fragrant, filling the teeth. Those who taste it often do not know satiety. The ones produced in Changle County - located on the south bank of the Minjiang River - are about an inch large and are the best, named 'Changle Round'..." It can also be seen that the Xinghua longan of the past was not only mediocre, just like the others, but was actually inferior to the quality of those produced in Changle County, which should have taken the first place! However, how can it now exclusively enjoy a great reputation, causing all its peers to be eliminated? First, I believe it was promoted by the local poet Song Jue, just like the chestnuts of Liangxiang, whose value suddenly increased after being praised by Fan Chengda. Indeed, Song Jue not only has the few lines of poetry cited earlier, but he also specifically defended the longan's being undervalued in his "Lychee Manual," saying: "Round like black pearls, red like golden pills, flesh like glass, kernel like black lacquer, nourishing essence and marrow, quenching thirst and alleviating hunger, beautifying the complexion, moisturizing the skin, with various effects that cannot be enumerated. As for sending them far away and selling them widely, with merchants making twice the profit of lychees, then how can longan be disparaged?" (To be continued)

Spring and Autumn

### Mr. Ji Luan's Remains Return to Shaanxi for Burial

— Zhou

Half a year after Mr. Zhang Ji Luan passed away, his coffin was moved to Xi'an for burial. From then on, the role model of a generation will forever be separated from the world, leaving behind millions of words of concern for the times, spurring on those who come after. Recalling the talent displayed at the foot of Mount Hua, I deeply feel the sadness of the wind and rain!

Mr. Ji Luan's writing and morality will forever be a model for the world. Although I once received instruction from Mr. Zhang, with Mr. Zhang's vast and profound knowledge, it is beyond my shallow understanding to grasp even a ten-thousandth of it. However, over the years, I have deeply recognized Mr. Zhang's perseverance in action and integrity, his calm mind, and his passionate emotions. His attitude in holding opinions and treating the world was one of great respect, and his expectations for the world were very high. Although his vision was ahead of his time, his heart was behind the world. Mr. Zhang once told me: "The key to establishing an argument is that it is better to make people believe in my words than to make people fear my words; and it is better to make people enjoy my words than to make people believe in my words." This is probably the main purpose of Mr. Zhang's painstaking efforts in establishing arguments for decades!

Mr. Zhang has passed away, but his immortal writings and integrity will be a teacher for future generations and a law for the world. How can this be accidental!

The news business is a public undertaking of society, and it must be a pleasure to serve society in order to be truly needed by society. And the most important service must have a spirit of perseverance and consistency from beginning to end. In addition to studying in Japan, Mr. Zhang devoted his life's energy to his career, to society, never interrupting or retreating, never ceasing to work for his career, never ceasing to work for society. This kind of spirit should be deeply recognized by those engaged in social undertakings.

### My Quitting Smoking

— Demai

When white rice was only selling for 300 yuan per dan, my wife had already complained about my smoking. Now that white rice costs "call" 500 yuan, if I continue to smoke one cigarette after another, allowing most of my hard-earned salary to turn into ashes, not only will I feel guilty before God, but the whole family will have no food to eat. At that time, it will be difficult to offend the public's anger, and wouldn't I be forced to death? After thinking it over and over again, the only option is to quit smoking.

Although it is said to be cigarettes, this smoking addiction is no different from opium. Before quitting, my heart was filled with trepidation, as if a great disaster was about to befall me. In this day and age when human life is as cheap as a dog's, I don't know why, but I cherish my own life in particular. It seems like someone is saying to me in my ear: "Quitting cigarettes is like quitting opium. You can't quit all at once. You can only use the reduction method. For example, if you smoke twenty cigarettes a day, change it to ten cigarettes. After a week, reduce it to five cigarettes. Reduce it according to this proportion until you don't smoke at all. This is the safest method. Otherwise, you will feel infinite pain in your spirit."

After such a thought flashed through my mind, I naturally couldn't resolutely quit. I reduced from smoking twenty cigarettes a day to ten cigarettes, and then from ten cigarettes to five cigarettes. During this stage, I didn't seem to feel any spiritual pain; but when I reduced from five cigarettes a day to zero, there was a huge reaction. When I had nothing to do, not only did my mouth feel bland, but even those two fingers that were used to holding cigarettes seemed to have nowhere to put them. When I saw others smoking, I imagined how comfortable they were at this moment, as those wisps of smoke slowly came out of their mouths and turned into a cloud. Especially after meals or "going to the toilet," I warmly missed cigarettes. Before quitting smoking, I wanted to smoke 砲台 after smoking 大前門; after having 三砲台, I still wanted 白錫包. Now I have reached the point where I am hungry without food, and I am just careless, any brand will do, as long as I have a cigarette.

As a result of "bitter love," I couldn't help but ask myself, "Life is like a white horse passing through a gap. In this chaotic world, I don't know what tomorrow will bring after today. Why bother to suffer like this? Rich people eat delicacies from mountains and seas, top-quality white japonica rice, and smoke at least 白錫包. We are all human beings. Since 500 yuan a dan of 度米 is already unavailable to me, is it necessary to strip away even the right to enjoy this little bit?" Thinking of this, I couldn't help but "anger rises from my heart, and evil grows on the edge of my courage." I threw the problem of eating for the whole family to the back of my mind and ran straight to the entrance of the cigarette paper shop, where I stared at the colorful cigarettes on display for a while. But this "staring" was neither over the butcher's door and eating heartily, nor did it have the thought of quenching thirst with plums because what I encountered was a real problem—my pockets were empty. What could I use to buy them? Heavens!

### The Tragedy of the Soul

— Zhuma

It is undeniable that eating is human nature. Although an infant has not yet reached the "toddler" stage, he already knows another important use of his mouth. However, because he is ignorant and unknowing, he thinks that everything can be eaten except for sucking the sweet milk from his mother's breast, so that innocent bite marks are left on the 洋囡, and when there are silver coins, mothers are always careful that their children swallow them. But because of this, rubber nipples can be used to coax children.

Ignorant and unknowing infants seem to be happy. How beautiful and peaceful their souls, which reveal their nature without being carved, are. But children have to grow up after all. If they also have to receive some education, then there will often be a little sad incident that annoys their parents. Like a neighboring little sister who is studying in the second grade of elementary school, one day she said to her mother: "Mom, I want to eat green vegetables, tofu, milk, and eggs every day. They are the best and most nutritious." Her words were not without reason. There is a course called common sense in the second grade of elementary school. She is reading about the chapter on food. She knows "what is easy to digest"? "You should take a walk after eating to make your blood circulate"; she also knows "I should eat nutritious food every day, such as green vegetables, tofu, milk, and eggs." The little sister's request to her mother is precisely her cleverness. She wants to realize the knowledge she has learned in her life. "To learn and practice it at times" is something that should be praised by her mother in her childish heart. However, the mother was furious:

"You little devil, we don't even have rice to eat, and you want to eat milk and eggs. Hush!"

But I think that after the little sister was "hushed" by her mother, although she didn't cry, her mood was not peaceful after all. Milk, eggs, and even tofu have always been considered daily food, but now they are only available to the wealthy. Before the little sister understood this knowledge, she could still be considered happy. After that, she couldn't help but feel regret at mealtimes.

This reminds me of the whole story of A. Gide's "Pastoral Symphony." A blind girl who was originally ignorant and unknowing had her thoughts and knowledge opened and enhanced after being earnestly taught by a kind pastor. She gradually knew the pain of being blind, and love grew in her heart. Later, her eyes recovered, and her original heart, which only had light and happiness, was further devastated. She understood that taking someone else's love was a sin. All her aspirations were shattered by the baseness and sorrow of the world. She wanted to commit suicide, and eventually died.

"People without eyes should be so happy!" A. Gide used his pale hand to outline such a century. As I read, I thought, and I shuddered deeply!

### How to Spend This Summer

— Weicheng

The Shanghai Municipal Council's No. 581 bulletin announced that cholera vaccinations will be given to the public in the east, west, north, and central districts. This is a warning that summer is coming.

Summer is a terrible season. All terrible diseases occur in this season. There is a great danger of death if you are not careful. Although there are many corpses on the streets in winter, they are no match for the pressure of hunger and cold. Once summer arrives, grinding rice grinds out sha. Then, even if a liter of rice has already been poured into the bag, I am afraid that you will not be able to wait to take it home to cook.

Rich people are indeed designing summer clothes. Since women wear western pants, so-called "new clothes experts" have to make several new styles for grandmothers and wives. Poor people go to their "maternal uncle's house" to change seasons. It sounds like a good opportunity, because winter clothes are always more valuable than summer clothes. But precisely because winter clothes are valuable, many people can't wait to change into summer clothes and sell them for money first. Once they are sold for money, they are transformed into consumables for the stomach. When summer arrives, the current price of summer clothes is probably higher than that of winter clothes.

Large quantities of summer necessities, such as medicated soap, mothballs, and cologne, are all being hoarded. It seems very difficult to be a little "hygienic." In the past, there were philanthropists who donated sha medicine water, but today's sha medicine water is as valuable as a "charity lottery ticket."

How to spend this summer?

### Sharing the Same Boat Through Wind and Rain

— He Jia Zhi

(3) Guests Arrive

Tonight, Fei Changhe wanted Cui Zhen to take off the gold ring on her hand. Cui Zhen said that it was given to her by her Aunt Ye, and she couldn't transfer it to others. Weicheng quickly said, "Did her uncle beat Sister Cui Zhen?" The country woman said, "It would be better if he just beat her. He even forced her to die. It's really unreasonable. After discussing it among ourselves, we had no choice but to ask Young Master Ye to come, and he could still suppress this cursed star." Weicheng didn't hesitate at all. He turned around in the bedroom, grabbed a black cloth mandarin jacket, and walked out while putting it on, saying to the country woman, "I'll go with you." Second Madam Ye knew that Weicheng was going in a hurry, so she didn't stop him anymore. She just put a white knot cloth hat on Weicheng's head and said, "He Zixing, A Yu, both accompany the young master. Light a lamp. Be careful when crossing the bridge and the weir." She also said, "Fei Changhe is not a good person. Weicheng, don't quarrel with him. It would be great luck if you could bring Cui Zhen to our house to stay for a few days." Weicheng said, "I know everything."

Fei's house was only half a li away from Ye's house in Shide Hall, and it only took ten minutes to walk there. Weicheng and the other four people, with two lamps, walked on the narrow and uneven road, and they arrived in the blink of an eye. The country woman said, "Fei Changhe's house has lights shining outside. Young Master Ye, go in. Don't say that I came to tell you." As she spoke, she blew out the lantern with a "puff" and didn't follow anymore. Weicheng felt that there were several women by the roadside waiting to meet the country woman. Walking to the threshing floor, he could already hear the sound of someone talking: "After I finish drinking this cup of wine, hum, then you have to hand over the gold ring to me. You've been thinking about it for so long, you should have figured it out. I raised you since you were a child, and it's not too late to ask you for this little thing. Even if I have to cut a piece of meat from your body, you'll be too embarrassed not to give it to me. Wei Yunqing is my friend. Go cry to him..." Then there was a loud bang. Weicheng and A Xing rushed into the light and pushed open the half-open door. They saw Fei Changhe murderous, hitting a rolling pin as thick as an arm on the table. In the room, his wife, who was as thin as a loofah, was sitting on the loom; his daughter, who was as short as a winter melon, was hiding in the corner; and Sister Cui Zhen, with tears all over her face, was hiding behind Fei Changhe's daughter. On the table, the soup in the bowl and the wine in the cup were all spilled out, flowing down. (52)

### The Story of a Penny

— M.W.

The other day, when I was waiting for a tram somewhere, a pedestrian, Mr. A, accidentally dropped a penny of national currency while taking out his pocket. It happened to be seen by Mr. B, who had the virtue of "returning money found," and loudly called back Mr. A, telling him the reason. Who knew that Mr. A would ignore it as if he hadn't heard it and left without showing his face. Mr. B was stunned for a moment, but he didn't know whether it was because his heart for "doing good" arose spontaneously, or because he was "being generous with other people's money," he was about to transfer this penny to charity and donate it to the old beggar woman sitting on the ground by the roadside. Unexpectedly, things turned out to be unexpected. Not only did the old beggar woman refuse to accept it, but she loudly said, "Sir, now big cakes sell for three corners, what use is a penny!" Mr. B was thwarted a second time and was greatly disappointed. In anger, he tore this "inauspicious penny" into pieces of butterflies to vent his hatred.

After witnessing this incident, I recalled an interesting story from before the war about a lawsuit in court over three copper coins: "In the spring of the 26th year of the Republic of China, Mr. So-and-so, a resident of East Street, sued his daughter-in-law and grandson in court for the crime of harming his parents. Mr. So-and-so pointed at his daughter-in-law and said, "My lord, my son is not completely insane. It is she who is disobedient to me. Today, I asked her to buy three copper coins worth of amaranth, but she bought two copper coins worth of bean sprouts to save money. My teeth are not good, I can't eat much, and I can save money, so I lost my temper and overturned the table and broke the bowl. She refused to accept it and told her grandson to throw me with broken bowls. I beat the grandson, and she came to hit me. When the son came back, he also helped her pull my arm. Now my arm is bleeding and I can't move it. My lord, you must deal with a big case of disobedience to me."

Thinking that the three copper coins at that time were also worth a penny of national currency, with the same penny, the difference in value between the two is more than a thousand miles apart in five or six years!

### Auctioning Rotten Rice

— Lu Yishi

Probably because the number of people returning to their hometowns is increasing day by day, radios, carpets, mahogany furniture, western-style woodenware, and even electric irons and flush toilets are all in urgent need of finding a "way out," so auction houses have also increased accordingly. But we who are busy with food and clothing have a feeling of "familiarity with unfamiliar faces" about the business advertisements of these auction houses. In fact, as long as the table doesn't tilt east and west, and the red-lacquered domestic toilet hasn't exceeded its "service life," there's no need to change it to "flush something or other." However, the scope of auctioned items is increasingly expanding due to the increase in quantity. Occasionally flipping through these advertisements, I found one of the new auctioned items next to the "sofa chair - porcelain hanging pot - one," which said: "Rotten rice," there are more than 30 bags of it, "pay cash after the auction and clear it out on the same day." At this time when rice is as expensive as pearls, and there is almost nowhere to sell it even if you have money, I can't help but feel as if I've seen clouds in a great drought; but unfortunately, waiting until the white rice has undergone "physiological" changes is ultimately not as fragrant as Shaoxing Huadiao wine, which becomes more fragrant the longer it ages, and sells for a good price, so it becomes a "honored guest" of the auction house and is listed as an antique treasure, and even though it is "rotten," it is still glorious.

However, some people see children waving quasi-standard auctions on the road, and in the classified advertisements, they often feel disguised auctions with advertisements for "adopting sons" with "considerable compensation" or "being able to seek employment," or they are selling the "wares" in the "big belly" before they have raised sons. The physiological changes of people are not necessarily as valuable as the physiologically changed rotten rice, and one cannot help but sigh.

### Seeking Spring

— Wang Ye

Recently, many people are shouting "Where is our spring?" This is not surprising; spring has indeed disappeared without a trace, and I can't find it no matter how I look. Moreover, spring is not a person, and I can't post a classified advertisement to find it by saying "square face, dark complexion, scar on the left eyebrow": this makes it even more difficult.

Some people are determined to go to the top floor of the International Hotel to find it, thinking that they will surely find traces in the extreme distance, but they don't; some people are smart and go to the basement of the Daxin Company to find it, thinking that everything outside is rising in price, and spring must have run to the discount department to buy goods, but they don't find it either; some people are very confident and go to the park to find it, thinking that the spring is bright and beautiful, and the spring is full of life, and they will never fail, but in the end, they don't see bees or butterflies, except for two "precocious" flies, they don't see anything. So they run to complain: "Where is spring?"

And in fact, the weather is as cold as if it is immersed in ice water.
