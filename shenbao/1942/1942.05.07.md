Tokyo, 6th (Domei News Agency) – Imperial Headquarters announced this morning at 10:10 AM that Japanese forces in Burma occupied Nyaungbin Airfield, on the Burmese-Indian border, on the 4th of this month.

Tokyo, 4th (Domei News Agency) – Nyaungbin Airfield, located on the coast of the Bay of Bengal in western Burma, was occupied by the Japanese Army on the 4th. This airfield was previously the largest air force base for enemy forces operating in Burma and a forward outpost for the defense of India. It is only 500 kilometers northwest of Calcutta, reachable in just over an hour by air, and less than 2,000 kilometers southwest of Ceylon. Therefore, the Japanese occupation of this airfield will pose a serious threat to key locations in northeastern India, such as Calcutta and Chittagong.

Tokyo, 6th (Domei News Agency) – Nyaungbin, captured by the Japanese Army on the 4th, is the most prosperous city in the Akyab region of western Burma, with a population of approximately 40,000. Since the British government abolished various restrictions on the Burmese government, the city's commercial development has been rapid. In terms of trade, it is Burma's fourth most important port, and in terms of population, it is the fifth largest city in Burma. Important exports include rice, timber, and petroleum. Historically, it is the birthplace of the Arakan Kingdom. An international airfield is located in the suburbs. After the outbreak of the war, the British quickly built another airfield there.

### Burma's Rich Oil Production

Tokyo, 6th (Domei News Agency) – With Mandalay, Burma, now in Japanese hands, regarding Burma's oil fields, which produce approximately 300 million gallons annually, according to Ichizo Omura, Vice President of the Imperial Japanese Petroleum Company, the Burmese oil fields are mostly concentrated in the Irrawaddy River basin. In this area, there are large oil fields that produce millions of tons annually. These oil fields were among the first in the world to adopt industrial methods for oil extraction. In the mid-19th century, as a result of the British invasion, the Burmah Oil Company and the Rangoon Oil Company were successively established, signing contracts with residents to begin extraction. Subsequently, new companies were continuously established, competing to sign contracts with residents. Therefore, within this mining area, oil wells are now scattered like stars. Regarding all Burmese oil fields, the Yenangyaung oil field was discovered in 1897 and began extraction in 1902, with an annual output of approximately 489,019 tons. The produced oil is transported to Ayeyarwady via four pipelines. The oil-producing area is two miles long, and there are currently over 3,000 oil wells, with an annual output of approximately 453,886 tons. In addition, the production of other oil fields, such as Ayeyadaw, is 88,445 tons, Minbu is 11,767 tons, Tayaungdaw is 10,895 tons, and Indaw is 9,476 tons.

### Vichy Protests to the US Over Attack on Madagascar; British Troops Encounter Resistance During Northern Landing; Street Fighting in Diego Suarez Port

Vichy, 5th (Hawas News Agency) – Following the invasion of French-controlled Madagascar, Chief of Government and Foreign Minister Laval personally delivered a strong protest to the American Chargé d'Affaires, Duke, demanding its transmission to Washington. The protest stated: "The French government lodges its strongest and most serious protest against the British military's brutal invasion of French-controlled Madagascar. The French government is aware of the guarantee that the island will be returned to France at a later date, but cannot condone the U.S. prohibiting the French from resisting invasion. Our government has the right to defend its obligations regarding French honor and will not allow interference by others. The Madagascar garrison is fully aware of this. Since the signing of the Franco-German armistice, Britain's provocations against France have been numerous. The French government had expected this British invasion of Madagascar. However, since President Roosevelt has agreed to assume responsibility for the invasion of Madagascar, our government will hold the President accountable for the consequences."

New York, 6th (Reuters) – New York wireless radio broadcast a Vichy dispatch today stating that French forces in Madagascar are currently engaged in street fighting with British troops in the northern naval base of Diego Suarez.

London, 6th (Reuters) – Responsible individuals in London stated today that French forces in Madagascar are resisting the British landing in accordance with the recent French government "declaration of resistance against any invasion." According to the British, the key port is Diego Suarez. The British landing site, Courrier Bay, is behind the port, where defenses are not strong. The French only have a small coastal defense force stationed in the area. Reports that three French cruisers have sailed from Dakar to Madagascar have not been confirmed.

Vichy, 5th (Hawas News Agency) – According to news from Madagascar, the British forces invading the island number over 20,000, while the French garrison on the island is only one-third of that number. The British fleet attacking the northern Diego Suarez naval base includes two cruisers, four destroyers, two troop transports, and one aircraft carrier. According to unconfirmed reports, the British initially attacked with paratroopers, and yesterday French forces shot down two British aircraft. The British aircraft carrier carried a total of four squadrons of aircraft.

Vichy, 5th (Hawas News Agency) – The majority of the French forces defending French-controlled Madagascar are naval personnel. The initial objective of the British appears to be the Diego Suarez naval base. The British fleet is attacking from the sea, while aircraft are covering the landing of marines from the rear. The British landing site, Courrier Bay, is approximately ten miles from Diego Suarez. It has been confirmed here that the British commander in this area is Rear Admiral Syfret, a South African who has served in the navy for 38 years. He has served as captain of the battleships "Ramillies" and "Rodney" and recently received a medal for his war efforts in the Mediterranean. The army commander is Lieutenant General Sturges, who participated in the Gallipoli campaign during the last World War.

Darlan Encourages Garrison to Exert Utmost Effort in Self-Defense

Vichy, 5th (Hawas News Agency) – French Commander-in-Chief of Land, Sea, and Air Forces, General Darlan, telegraphed the garrison in Madagascar today, stating: "The British and Americans, who do not fight their enemies, have suddenly attacked our colony, thousands of miles away from the motherland, attempting to achieve their goals. Marshal Pétain asks you to defend your territory. You possess a full patriotic fervor and have been ordered to resist in order to defend the honor of our flag and force Britain to pay the maximum price for its actions. All of France and the colonial empire will stand behind you. Britain abandoned us and left us to our fate at the Front. They later attacked us in Oran, Dakar, Syria, and other battles. British aircraft have bombed many of our undefended cities, and attempted to starve the women and children of Djibouti. All of this should not be forgotten by us. I hope you will exert your utmost effort in defense, thereby defending the glory of France. The day will come when we settle accounts with Britain. Long live France!"

Vichy, 5th (Hawas News Agency) – The Ministry of Colonies received a telegram from the Governor-General of French-controlled Madagascar, Annet, stating: "The city of Diego Suarez was suddenly attacked by air force at dawn today, and also with naval cover.

Marshal Pétain immediately sent a telegram to express his condolences and encouragement, stating: "I am aware that British forces are invading Madagascar, and that the garrison commander has replied to the British ultimatum with resistance to the end. In the current circumstances, this response is most appropriate. Please inform the commander that he is defending the glory of France in such a tragic situation, and I will assist him. Finally, please convey this message to all civilians, naval, land, and air force soldiers."

Vichy Confirms That Two French Warships Were Sunk

Clermont-Ferrand, 6th (Hawas News Agency) – Regarding the fighting in Madagascar, there is very little news here this morning, likely due to difficulties in wireless communication. Reports received by Vichy are only from yesterday. The British attack is said to be limited to the Diego Suarez naval base. There is no news on any actions taken regarding the two major cities of Tananarive and Tamatave. France stationed one auxiliary cruiser and two 1,500-ton submarines in Diego Suarez Bay. After the start of hostilities, these ships sailed out to meet the British fleet, preventing it from approaching the coast and landing troops, and concentrating their attack on two British troop transports, each carrying 6,000 soldiers. The auxiliary cruiser and one submarine were subsequently sunk, but most sailors were rescued. At the same time, British aircraft bombed military facilities on the island, with several being shot down. Soon after, British forces landed at Courrier Bay, including some light tanks. The French garrison consisted of only one battalion of colonial infantry and 200 sailors, but they resisted fiercely and destroyed several British tanks. The condition of the garrison this morning is unknown.

London, 6th (Reuters) – Responsible individuals in London stated that French resistance in Madagascar has become stronger. British forces, after landing in intense heat, have advanced over 20 miles. They are now very close to the Diego Suarez naval base and the two destinations to its south, Antsiranana. According to London, the British landing was only in the northern part of the island. The progress of the battle and the increasing resistance were expected. Fighting continued this morning, and the results have not yet been reported to London. Also, the French Naval Ministry announced that during the initial attack on Madagascar's arsenal, the French submarine "Bévéziers" and auxiliary cruiser "Bougainville" were sunk. Almost all of the crew members were rescued.

Hull Reissues Statement; Decides to Provide Aid to the British

Washington, 5th (Hawas News Agency) – Regarding the British landing in Madagascar, Secretary of State Hull met with the press today, reaffirming the statement issued by the State Department last night. He stated that the United States is prepared to assist the British in occupying Madagascar. If necessary, U.S. warships will take action to provide aid. The U.S. government is also closely monitoring the situation in Martinique, just as it is paying attention to other developments of the Laval government. According to the State Department, no official news has been received regarding French resistance in Madagascar. It is not yet convenient to announce whether U.S. forces will participate in the military operations to occupy the island. In addition, President Roosevelt declined to comment on this matter when he met with reporters today.

Vichy, 6th (Haitong News Agency) – The American Embassy in Vichy sent a note to the French government yesterday. In the note, the American government stated that the United States fully supports Britain's actions in Madagascar. The content of the note is the same as President Roosevelt's message to the French representative in Washington.

French Officials Defend Actions Regarding Vietnam

Vichy, 5th (Hawas News Agency) – Official sources here stated that Japan has never made any demands on France regarding Madagascar. The British invasion of the island cannot be compared to the Japanese deployment in Vietnam, as Japan negotiated with France when it deemed it necessary to establish a base in Vietnam, which Britain never did. The forces used by the British to attack Madagascar are stronger than the island's garrison, which is evident in the valiant resistance of our troops. According to the latest news received here, British forces are attacking Diego Suarez Port using light motorized units. The use of paratroopers by the British has also been confirmed.

Vichy, 5th (Hawas News Agency) – Regarding the Madagascar incident, the French Information Bureau issued a communiqué today stating that this British invasion of French territory is a continuation of Britain's repeated invasions and atrocities. We still remember the various incidents in Oran, Dakar, Syria, and Saint Pierre and Miquelon, which do not need to be repeated. North Africa and Djibouti are still under siege by British forces, and British aircraft are constantly bombing our undefended cities. The British navy is also plundering our merchant ships, blockading our coasts, and attempting to starve our people. The British claim that they are at war with Japan and that the situation in Madagascar is important is a complete lie, as the island is at least 4,000 miles away from the nearest base occupied by Japan. At a time when British forces are collapsing in Burma and the attempt to open a "second front" in Europe has failed, this is merely an attempt to restore their prestige. The British occupation of Madagascar is an act of plunder, as any place occupied by the British will be subjected to the same threat. Madagascar was painstakingly developed by the late General Gallieni and dedicated to the motherland. On Marshal Pétain's birthday, the residents of the island expressed their loyalty to France.

Vichy, May 5th (Havas) - When Chief of Government Laval met with newspaper reporters today, the reporters asked about the Madagascar incident. Laval replied, "The British are acting openly, not hiding behind de Gaulle's faction. This is the first time. As for how Japan will react, you should ask the Japanese Ambassador to France. This morning, I met with the US Chargé d'Affaires, Tuck, and handed him the French government's protest note, telling him that the note was brief but included the essence of this morning's conversation. I could have been emotional, as any Frenchman or any American familiar with our national history would be. But I only told him, 'When I spoke with your Ambassador Leahy, you were also present. At that time, I said that the final turn in relations between our two countries would not be initiated by France. I would like to repeat those words to you now.'"

Rome, May 5th (Havas) - Political figures here strongly condemned the British landing in Madagascar, saying that in Italy, it was not unexpected, but only another clear demonstration of British disregard for international obligations and the status of neutral countries, and that it violated international practice to do this to a former ally.

### Madagascar: An Overview of the Situation, France Expresses Deep Concern About the Fate of Nearby Islands

Vichy, May 5th (Havas) - The British invasion of French Madagascar has now attracted worldwide attention. A brief description of the island's geography and history is as follows: Madagascar is the fourth largest island in the world, located off the east coast of Africa, separated from the African continent by only a narrow strip of water, the Mozambique Channel. At its narrowest point, it is only 240 miles wide. The island has a total area of ​​241,000 square miles and a population of 4 million. It became a French protectorate in 1885, and a French colony in 1896. The land is fertile, with 3 million acres of arable land, mainly producing rice, beans, coffee, and sugar cane. Agriculture and animal husbandry are the main industries. Mineral resources are also relatively developed. The naval base of Diego Suarez, located in the northwest of the island, is the best natural naval base in the Indian Ocean. As a result of this British invasion, problems will also arise on nearby islands, such as Réunion in the southeast and the Comoros Islands in the northwest. It is not yet known whether British forces have begun to attack the above two islands. Réunion has belonged to France since 1643 and has a population of 208,000, mostly of French descent. The Comoros Islands are rich in resources and are probably the richest islands in the Indian Ocean.

In addition, the authorities will crack down on those who deliberately manipulate for profit. After the implementation of the above fundamental and palliative measures, the panic caused by the shortage of one-yuan notes has actually turned around, and the premium rate for one-yuan notes has also fallen back. It is expected that it will be completely eliminated in the short term.

### Large Batch of Rice Weevils Released After Reprimand

Inspector General of the French Police Department, Gui Maiquan, received a tip-off the day before yesterday at noon that rice weevils were gathering their colleagues in a tea room in Gujiazhai Park to discuss raising the black market price of national rice, which is related to the entire livelihood of the city. He immediately led detectives to surround and arrest them, detaining as many as 92 rice weevils such as Yao Heqing, and taking them back to the police station for investigation. The details have been recorded in yesterday's newspaper. It is now known that after investigation by the police station, Yao and others have denied that they gathered to discuss raising rice prices, and there is no other evidence to be found. They were released at noon yesterday. When they were released, the French police department earnestly warned them not to engage in secret transactions or raise the market price of national rice, so as not to hinder the people's food. If they commit the crime again, they will be severely punished.

### Deposit Interest Income Tax No Longer Refunded

According to the tax rate regulations, the deposit interest income tax of each bank and financial institution is 5/1000, and 1/1000 is the handling fee for each bank and financial institution. However, in order to treat depositors favorably, each bank and financial institution, with the approval of the Ministry of Finance, will refund the 1/1000 handling fee allocated to each bank and financial institution to depositors. The United Committee of Banks and Financial Institutions recently resolved that, starting from May 1st, the 1/1000 handling fee deducted from the deposit interest income tax will be used to subsidize the expenses of the banks and financial institutions in handling the income tax, and will no longer be refunded to depositors. The deposit interest income tax before April 30 will still be handled according to the previous method, and each bank and financial institution has already followed suit.

### Inspection Rules for Licensed Premises

This will be implemented from May 8th of this year. This amended rule will also apply to Article 31 of Chapter 1 of the Milk and Dairy Farm Regulations from the same date. Furthermore, from the same date, the article on payment of taxes in the regulations for various licensed premises is amended as follows: "The licensee shall pay the municipal general tax and other taxes payable on the premises and business operations in the premises when due."

### Bread Users Should Register As Soon As Possible

According to information from the Shanghai Municipal Council's Information Office, all users who need bread supply, including former Sullivan's customers, who have not yet registered, please register immediately with the stores that supply them. After the bakeries accept the registration applications of users, they will forward them to the authorities for registration in order to receive the required flour supply. As for those who need to purchase bread for public houses, hotels, restaurants, hospitals, and charitable organizations, they should also apply to the stores that supply them, and the application must indicate the required quantity. When applying for registration, each application will be charged a registration fee of 5 storage coins. Those who cannot afford the 5 yuan registration fee should contact their respective national associations. The authorities can only supply flour to bakeries for the quantity of bread prepared in the applications submitted before the 13th of this month. Therefore, those who have not registered the quantity of bread they need may not be able to obtain bread supply from the bakeries that used to supply them. The public is requested to pay attention.

### Moufu and Haifu Shipping Offices Have Been Closed, Companies Have Been Reorganized to Handle Resumption of Navigation

The NingShao Shipping Company, Shanghai-Ningbo, changed to the German flag after the August 13th Incident and was renamed Moufu, managed by the German company Laihe Foreign Firm. The ship sailed to Wenzhou in the winter of the year before last and was detained by the Japanese Navy and monitored in Dinghai. It has been nearly a year and a half. Recently, with the help of mediation, it was finally understood by the Japanese side. The ship was released and returned to Shanghai last month and berthed at the No. 22-23 pontoon in Yangshupu. The details have been recorded in the previous newspaper.

Moufu

It is now known that the ship will be reorganized into a company to operate in eastern Zhejiang. However, the current situation is different from before. The ship will leave the German company and change its flag. It is also heard that the Moufu and Haifu shipping offices of Laihe Foreign Firm will be closed immediately. All the Chinese employees of the Moufu Shipping Department were originally employees of the NingShao Company, so they will return to the NingShao Shipping Company to serve. It is also learned that the ship will first repair the deck starting from yesterday. After the cabin is repaired, it will be docked for inspection of the hull and bottom of the ship. The procedures for the shipping route are currently being processed.

Haifu

Also, the Haifu ship was sold to the Yamashita Company. Now, a company is organized by Xu and others to handle the resumption of navigation. Since the ship changed ownership, it changed its flag and restored the name of Zhoushan ship. It is now heard that the name of Zhoushan is not intended to be used, and there is a saying that it will be changed to Wansheng. The shipping route has also not been determined. The ship was re-docked the day before yesterday to inspect the bottom of the ship. It is expected to be completed in about two weeks. There is no definite news on the resumption of navigation.

### Current Plans for Tramway Traffic Across the Waibaidu Bridge

Route 14 will go directly to the English-language North China Daily News, according to Shanghai Electric Tramway Company General Manager Evans this morning (June 6). The resumption of tramway traffic across the Waibaidu Bridge and the complete unification of tramways north and south of the Suzhou River in the International Settlement is currently under discussion. According to current plans, the normal state of tramway traffic will be restored around June. If trams resume crossing the Waibaidu Bridge as scheduled, it will have been almost five years since normal tramway traffic across the Suzhou River stopped. When the August 13th Incident broke out in 1937, all public transportation was suspended. Evans also disclosed that the Route 14 trolleybuses crossing the Suzhou River into the western Hongkou district currently require passengers to disembark when crossing the bridge. The resumption of passenger traffic across the bridge is also under discussion. According to reliable sources, the fares for trams north and south of the Suzhou River will be adjusted to avoid discrepancies. Hongkou fares are currently calculated in military scrip, while fares south of the river are calculated in legal tender. Plans are currently underway to reduce the current fares in Hongkou and increase those south of the Suzhou River. As for after the fares are unified, tram fares in Hongkou and Yangshupu will still be calculated in military scrip, and those south of the Suzhou River will still be in legal tender.

### Purchased Cheap Flour and Resold at High Price

A local resident, Ding Rengen, opened a postal restaurant at No. 304 North Suzhou Road, selling rice and noodles. On April 24 and May 4 of this year, Ding purchased a total of 41 bags of cheap flour from the Municipal Council for a price of 70 yuan in prepared currency. Unexpectedly, he did not use it himself, but resold it to Lu Bingcheng's steamed bun shop at No. 352 Wuchang Road for 138 yuan in legal tender per bag, making a profit from it. The matter was discovered by Xu Yongyuan, a Chinese detective in the Hongkou Police Department, who went yesterday to arrest Ding Rengen and seized 22 bags of flour from Lu's shop, taking them all to the police station to await investigation.

### Return Certificates to Be Issued Within Days

The Shanghai Municipal Council's Chinese Evacuation Association has sent personnel to collect the new certificates. Once received, they can be distributed to various fellow villagers' associations in Shanghai for normal issuance.

### Two Milk Powder and Milk Dealers Arrested for Lack of Milk Powder and Diluting Milk with Water

According to the English-language North China Daily News, the Municipal Council's Health Department continues to investigate the illegal activities of merchants in order to protect the health of the residents, and has recently discovered two more people and filed lawsuits. One is the manager of the MeiHua Trading Company at No. 316 Beijing Road, Hui Hansheng (transliteration), who sold "Royal" brand milk powder, each can labeled 40 ounces, but actually contained only 28.83 ounces. On March 30, inspectors from the Health Department purchased a can of this brand of milk powder from a food store at No. 512 Nanjing Road and found that the capacity was 27.8% short. After determining that the wholesale point was the MeiHua Trading Company, the defendant was arrested and interrogated three times, and a verdict is about to be reached. The other defendant is a German refugee, Lai Feide, residing at No. 820 Tangshan Road, whose milk sold on April 27 was found by the Health Department to be diluted with 34.9% water, which is extremely harmful to human health, so he was also arrested and interrogated, and a verdict is still pending.

### Customers of Mercantile Safe Deposit Boxes Limited to Three Days to Open, Overdue Boxes Will Be Automatically Opened by the Bank

Of the safe deposit boxes in British and American banks, the most are in Mercantile, with a total of more than 4,000, of which more than 2,000 have been rented out. Since the bank's safe deposit boxes have been opened to allow tenants to withdraw items that are allowed and not allowed to be withdrawn, although most have already been withdrawn, there are still a small number of tenants who have not yet applied to open the boxes and withdraw the allowed items. It is now known that the management has limited the deadline to the 9th of this month to bring the keys to withdraw. After the deadline, the bank will automatically open the boxes. The number of safe deposit boxes in HSBC and Chase banks is relatively small. Since permission has been granted to open them, most have been opened. Huabi does not have safe deposit boxes. The items are entrusted to the bank for safekeeping, which is of a different nature. More than half have been withdrawn. As of now, Citibank safe deposit boxes have not yet announced their opening.

The tide in the Huangpu River was stirred up, and at 3:00 pm, the tide was quite high, almost level with the Bund embankment. Tidal water emerged from the sewers onto the surface of low-lying roads, seemingly due to a monsoon originating in the Yangtze River basin, hence the wind was particularly fierce.

### Portuguese Consulate Plans to Develop Trade Between Shanghai and the Philippines; No News of a Portuguese Retreat Plan

According to an official from the Portuguese Consulate in this city yesterday, the consulate is currently studying plans to attract Portuguese merchants from Lourenço Marques, a Portuguese territory in South Africa, to develop business in Shanghai. The motivation for this plan is twofold: first, to increase trade between Lourenço Marques and Shanghai; and second, to solve the unemployment problem of the Portuguese in this city. The Portuguese authorities are currently asking the Japanese government to assist in the realization of this plan. Portuguese observers praise this move as a boon for the Portuguese community in this city, as many Portuguese have lost their jobs since the outbreak of the Pacific War. As for rumors that the Portuguese in this city will also retreat to Lourenço Marques along with the British and Americans, a spokesman for the Portuguese Consulate stated that no such plan has been made. This is impossible given the current extraordinary situation.

### The Significance and Impressions of the Chinese Pharmaceutical Exhibition (Part 2)

The first impression is admiration for the spirit of the organizers, who are determined to help the world. It is said that they spent four months preparing, and in such a short period, they were able to collect such a wealth of materials and arrange them in such an orderly manner. This is truly rare. Moreover, this kind of exhibition is the first of its kind, and such achievements are especially admirable.

The second impression is that modern science has discovered many new facts in Chinese medicine, which is also a new contribution of China to the world.

The third impression is the antique charm of the old objects and the lively and vividness of the living objects, which are unforgettable. In summary, this exhibition leaves the humble one with three impressions: goodness, truth, and beauty. However, nothing in the world is perfect, and nothing is unchangeable. According to the humble one's ideal, in the future, with the development of Chinese pharmacology—which will depend on the joint efforts of experts and everyone—a complete and purely Chinese herbal exhibition can be organized. What does complete mean? Let's take herbal medicine as an example. In addition to the decoction pieces, each medicine should have a botanical specimen, a histological section, a living form, a chemical extraction, a pharmacological experiment, a clinical effect, and various pharmacological tables. What does pure mean? It means that the academic organizations participating in the exhibition should only use the organization's name, not the personal name or the name of a drug store, so as to avoid the suspicion of "advertising for myself" on the one hand, and to avoid the audience from having an imperfect impression of the association on the other hand. Such an exhibition is an ideal, but an ideal is not a dream. As long as the experts work hard, it can be realized one day.

Furthermore, during the exhibition period, the exhibition will hold public lectures and demonstrations of pharmacological experiments, which will be held in the Zhen Dan Medical College. Everyone is welcome to participate freely. April 18th, Research on the Translation of the Compendium of Materia Medica, Dr. Wang Jimin. April 24th, 5:30 PM, Pharmacological Experiment, Dr. Wu Yunrui and Dr. Zuo Lin. April 25th, 6:00 PM, The Relationship Between the Pasteur Institute and Chinese Medicine, Dr. Liu Yongchun. Events to be held in the coming days also include May 2nd, 6:00 AM, Humble Opinions on the Study of Chinese Medicine, Dr. Wu Yunrui. May 10th, 5:30 PM, Li Shizhen's Phonology, Dr. Huang Shengbai. Location: Room 119, First Floor, New Building, Aurora University, 223 Luban Road. All are welcome to attend.

### Friendly Football Match: Hequn Wins Over Aurora 3-2 in an Exciting Game

An exciting friendly football match between Hequn and Aurora took place at the Aurora Stadium yesterday at 5:30 PM, with thousands of spectators in attendance. When the time came, the referee Jiang Yinsheng blew the whistle to start the game. Hequn played against the wind, and their forwards had difficulty making progress. Aurora's center forward, Mr. Ba, made his debut yesterday and showed the skills of a renowned player. Less than ten minutes into the game, Mr. Ba scored, opening the scoring. Hequn counterattacked, but due to the strong wind, they were unable to achieve anything. The first half ended with Aurora leading 1-0. Switching sides for the second half, Hequn had the wind at their backs and launched a strong attack. Center forward and veteran A Dai received the ball, jumped up, and headed it into the net, only six minutes after the start of the second half. Unexpectedly, less than two minutes later, fortune turned against them. Aurora launched a full-force attack, and left inside forward Su Hou San made a surprise attack. Hequn's goalkeeper was caught off guard, and the ball went in. Aurora once again took the lead 2-1. Hequn attacked, and two minutes later, Jia Youliang received a brilliant pass from Han Longhai and shot the ball into the goal, tying the score again.

### Selling Pressure Surges, Government Bonds Plunge, with Type A Falling the Most

The black market for government bonds started steadily yesterday, but selling pressure emerged in the middle of the day, affecting all types of bonds, with a total volume of nearly one million. However, buying interest remained strong, showing fierce competition. Sellers were quick to sell when the price was right, and buyers were willing to bid up the price, especially for Type C and Type B bonds. Although there were many Type D bonds available, buyers were still very interested. In many cases, buyers were unwilling to openly bid up the price and would wait for sellers to emerge before quietly buying them up. This shows that the buyers were waiting for an opportunity and were not revealing their intentions. This further proves that sellers had goods and buyers had capital, and that they were engaged in fierce competition. Yesterday, Type A bonds accounted for nearly one-third of the selling volume, which was the highest on record, causing them to fall by 2.10 yuan, the most significant decline. However, there were very few transactions above 6 yuan. Type C bonds only fell by a small amount of 0.10 yuan, and the price difference is gradually narrowing. In short, during this period of intense competition between buyers and sellers, market prices are bound to be chaotic. In addition to the buyers and sellers, other investors will sell when the price is too high and buy when the price is too low, hedging their positions. As a result, market prices will gradually return to normal. The market rose one day and fell the next, showing instability. Yesterday, the sellers were mainly Tongli, with all five types of bonds being sold. Dazhong and Shuntai also sold off some bonds. Tongyuan, Zhenhua, Xie Kang, and Tong Kang sold relatively few. The main buyer was Yongchang, which bought over 300,000 yuan worth of Type D bonds. Tongshun and Hu Heji each bought 100,000 to 200,000 yuan worth of bonds. Jiufeng and Wuhe also showed strong buying interest. The remaining buyers, such as Hongda, Chengkang, Yongkang, Yuanhe, Lianhe, Shunli, Zhongfu, and Xinhua, first sold and then bought, profiting from the price fluctuations. Many retail investors also profited from the market and closed their positions. As a result, all bonds fell in price, ranging from 0.50 yuan to 2.10 yuan, except for Type C bonds, which only fell by 0.10 yuan. The total transaction volume was approximately 2.2 to 2.3 million yuan. A summary table is listed below:

### Gold Prices Remain Firm; Cash Shops Limit Sales at a Set Price, Suppressing the Rise in Retail Prices

Yesterday, the black market for spot gold turned firm, as securities firms were still actively buying. However, cash shops were limiting sales at a set price of 21,000 yuan, making it difficult to break through this level. The multiple attempts to rise were suppressed.

At noon, cash shops were still trying to sell at the set price, but without success. The price was 150 yuan higher than the previous day, with a fluctuation of 250 yuan. Trading volume was thin.

The selling price of gold jewelry at gold shops such as Daxin and other firms remained at 2,200 yuan per tael (buying price reduced by 200 yuan). Silver was priced at 18 yuan, and the black market price was 15.56 yuan, still with a premium. Silver coins were stable at 9.35 yuan each.

### Single-Issue Banknotes in Serious Trouble; Further Increases Are Absurd

There is no sign of any support for single-issue banknotes, nor is there any indication of what measures will be taken. As a result, people are demanding single-issue banknotes for purchases, but refusing to accept them as change. Commodity prices have invisibly risen to units of 5 yuan. Single-issue banknotes are only going in and not coming out, creating an unwarranted panic. Going to a cigarette shop to exchange them is even more ridiculous, with a 5-yuan note only fetching 4.20 yuan, which is extremely disheartening.

Yesterday, the discount rate for head-marked bills remained at 12 to 17 yuan per thousand yuan, the same as the previous day. The interbank lending rate of the Money Trade Association remained at 9%. The difference between the new and old legal tender was 0.312 yuan per yuan.

### Foreign Currencies Stable

Yesterday's foreign currency market saw stable British and American gold pounds, with the former remaining at 500 yuan and the latter remaining at 510 yuan. US dollar notes were at 23.5 yuan. There was demand for funding positions, and someone was selling at 34 yuan. Hong Kong notes remained at 5.23 yuan. Military scrip opened at 7.25 yuan in the morning, rose to 0.3 yuan after opening, and then gradually fell to 7.21 yuan, down 0.03 yuan from the previous day.

### Sluggish Spot Sales; Cotton Yarn Outlook Turns Loose

The cotton yarn market is in a state of flux. Most people are bearish due to sluggish spot sales, but those with substantial inventories are not giving up. 42-count Blue Phoenix was priced at 13,800 yuan to 13,700 yuan. 42-count Fairy Peach was priced at 13,200 yuan. 42-count Precious Light was priced at 13,250 yuan. 80-count Sunlight was priced at 45,000 yuan. 60-count Buffalo Head was priced at 23,200 yuan. 40-count Colored Ball was priced at 12,450 yuan. 20-count Blue Phoenix was priced at 7,450 yuan. 20-count Moon Zero was priced at 6,700 yuan to 6,620 yuan. New and old tax 20-count Fairy Peach was priced at 6,850 yuan. 20-count Double Horse was priced at 6,300 yuan to 6,350 yuan. 16-count Red Kui Xing was priced at 6,540 yuan to 6,550 yuan. 16-count Great Treasure was priced at 6,450 yuan. 10-count Red Double Horse was priced at 4,810 yuan to 4,850 yuan. 10-count Boy Scout was priced at 4,750 yuan to 4,800 yuan. 10-count Double Globe was priced at 4,500 yuan. 6-count Bumblebee was priced at 6,300 yuan. 8-count Three Tigers was priced at 5,000 yuan. 20-count Double Horse factory open-plate was weak at 5,800 yuan and shortly after loosened to 5,770 yuan. At this time, the buying interest on the floor was not weak, and it rose again to 5,840 yuan. However, due to long covering, it softened again to 5,740 yuan.

### Many Retail Investors Turn to Selling; Eastern Cloth Trends Downward

Factory Cloth: The market was stable yesterday, but slightly soft. 16-pound Earth coarse cloth was priced at 260 yuan. Flying Goose was priced at 250 yuan. 8-pound Zhenzhong was priced at 135 yuan. 12-pound Earth fine cloth was priced at 228 yuan. Dapeng was priced at 239 yuan. Fugui was priced at 225 yuan. Fugui fine twill was priced at 195 yuan. Chick Linsen was priced at 355 yuan. Longevity silk was priced at 7.6 yuan. Wanbenli was priced at 7.2 yuan. Only small amounts were traded.

Eastern Cloth: Due to rising for many days in a row, retail investors turned to selling, and the market trended downward. Dragon Head fine cloth new singles opened in the morning at 188 yuan and rose to 189 yuan. By noon, they had fallen to 185 yuan. In the afternoon, they fell from 285.5 yuan to close at 284.5 yuan, down approximately 4 yuan per bolt. Old singles were at 255 yuan. Colored Ball fine cloth was at 255 yuan. Flying Fish was at 250 yuan. Yanghe was at 248 yuan. Trumpet was at 246 yuan. Five Blessings Double Fish fine twill was at 215 yuan. Baby was at 219 yuan. The highest price for Four Gentlemen Serge red singles was 9.52 yuan, the lowest was 9.36 yuan, and the evening close was 9.39 yuan.

### Woolen Fabrics Steady

Yesterday's woolen fabric market was not affected by the price controls. Prices for various goods remained exceptionally stable. Items such as overcoating, riding breeches, camel hair cloth, raincoat material, khaki drill, and medium-thick worsted for suits all trended firmly higher in both open and black markets. Most sellers were hoarding goods and unwilling to sell. Outsiders and groups of buyers remained blindly bold, dragging in goods aggressively regardless of high prices. Although the main reason for today's rapid and fierce rise in woolen fabrics is the shortage of inventory, much of it is also due to the outsiders stirring up trouble. The market price for Meifeng black and grey solid-color overcoating was 360 yuan per yard yesterday. The market price for Public Day grey first-grade overcoating was 300 yuan. The market price for third-grade was 185 yuan. Long-haired sea-otter was selling at 440 yuan. Riding breeches (grades 1 to 28, grass green color) were 250 yuan. Dark color was 280 yuan. Camel hair cloth was 220 yuan to 300 yuan. Golden Bear rainproof cloth was 27 yuan. Lianxin khaki drill was 12.5 yuan. Locally produced suit flannel ranged from 200 yuan to 280 yuan, while imported goods ranged from 210 yuan to 400 yuan. Grade 55 medium-thick worsted was 250 yuan.

### Why is the Cigarette Market Collapsing?

The recent poor performance of the cigarette market has reached a point that is difficult for outsiders to understand. In fact, the reason is quite simple. Older insiders predict that the market will inevitably decline. Observing the market trend, it is felt that everything is rising without end. Since the beginning of spring, the price of daily necessities has more than doubled, reaching a peak. The so-called "a thunderclap will inevitably lead to a devastating defeat." Therefore, the sharp decline in the price of items such as cigarettes, matches, soap, and candles is evident. Generally, domestic firms are seeing unfavorable trends and are cutting losses. Some are still hoping for better days and a return to color. However, most goods are price-controlled. Cigarettes, although they are consumables, are no exception. Demand from both domestic and foreign markets is allocated by the China Tobacco Distribution Association, and prices are fixed to prevent speculative behavior. County A is not allowed to sell to Town B, so export inspections have been quite strict recently. The former Wing Tai and Company has now been renamed Marusan Industrial Company, and the company's products are distributed to 200 firms in the city for retail only, and no wholesale is allowed. (Most of the transactions in the current market are for inventory.) Therefore, non-industry participants purchase at black market prices for retail sale, and business is greatly affected. Business is declining, and the rainy season is approaching, making it difficult to store goods for long. The above-mentioned pressures are clear at a glance. Yesterday's market saw transactions for Great British brand at 9,500 yuan, Old Knife at 7,600 yuan, Pinhai brand at 5,700 yuan, Wuhua brand at 5,000 yuan, and Little Fairy brand at 5,200 yuan, but there was a lack of trading, creating a situation of "having a market without trade." The number of transactions for Japanese cigarettes was small, and prices were still gradually declining. Jinqiang brand was at 1,900 yuan, Jinda building brand was at 2,400 yuan, Quanlu brand was at 2,450 yuan, and Zhifu brand was at 1,700 yuan, all falling by 50 yuan to 100 yuan compared to the previous day.

### Scarce Sales of Both Cake and Beans; Corn Bran Prices Rising

Trading in beans remained scarce yesterday, and most people were watching and waiting. Broad beans continued to fall by 5 yuan under selling pressure from retail investors. Red beans were soft, while soybeans remained stable. Transactions included 30 bags of Tianjin Jinyuan at 262 yuan delivered, 20 bags of Chongming sand red at 235 yuan delivered, and 50 bags of Father Sand bean at 135 yuan.

Corn sales turned brisk again yesterday, and market sentiment was relatively good, with prices rising by 3 to 5 yuan. Transactions included over 600 bags of Wuhu corn at 173.5 yuan to 175 yuan ex-warehouse, and 176 yuan to 180 yuan delivered.

Trading in bean cakes decreased yesterday, as spot sales weakened and hoarders became hesitant. As a result, the market fluctuated and ultimately remained stable. Transactions included 500 pieces of Hankou Su cake at 52 yuan, 1,000 pieces of Li Zi cake new warehouse receipts for May at 71 yuan, 5,000 pieces of Xing Ji bean cake old warehouse receipts for May at 57 yuan, old warehouse receipts for June at 57 yuan, and new warehouse receipts for April at 70 yuan to 71 yuan.

Domestic demand for bran continued, and rumors that the Eastern firm would be shipping in bulk caused market sentiment to trend higher, with prices being raised by 1 to 2 yuan. Transactions included 200 bags of Sanxin large-package bran at 115 yuan to 115.5 yuan, and 600 bags of small-package bran at 111 yuan. Warehouse receipts dated May 20 were priced at 114 yuan, and warehouse receipts dated the end of May were priced at 114.5 yuan.

### Strict Controls on Sugar Movement; Little Activity in the Black Market

Recently, the sugar market has seen little fluctuation due to the lack of volatility in military scrip, and overall prices have remained relatively stable. Sugar share prices have also been flat, with crude white share prices trading at 314 yuan and red sand share prices not being traded. Applications for the fourth round of rationing to retailers have begun, totaling 35,000 bags. Due to strict checks on movement permits, there is little activity in the black market.

### Refrigeration of Walnuts Begins

Due to the increasing heat, walnuts are susceptible to oiliness and insect infestation. Those who wish to store them for a long time and await favorable sales are selecting ordinary, inexpensive goods, such as Southern walnuts priced around two hundred twenty to two hundred thirty yuan per unit. These are considered the target and have already begun to be transferred to cold storage warehouses in preparation for sales when goods are scarce, which is seen as promising.

### White-Skinned Medicinal Fox Nuts in Demand

Recently, there have been limited arrivals of medicinal fox nuts, and prices are tightening. Because this product is very dry and suitable for storage, both merchants and customers are absorbing them, so prices are firm and not loosening. White-skinned ones are tighter, followed by yellow, and then red-skinned, with price differences of twenty to thirty yuan.

### Shangri-La—Basilan

— Yang Huashi

A few days ago, Basilan, the Shangri-La of the Philippines, was also subjected to the ravages of war.

Basilan is a small island located southwest of Mindanao. It can be reached in two and a half hours by small boat from Isabela Port in Zamboanga.

Basilan Island is surrounded by a wide bay and covers an area of approximately five hundred square kilometers. It was discovered by the Spanish in the seventeenth century, but due to the need to defend various southern parts of Mindanao and Zamboanga, no one paid attention to it. It was not until 1840, after the completion of the maritime route between Europe and Asia, that Basilan drew the world's attention.

In 1845, the Spanish built a fort here, and gradually people came to live there. In the Nibel area, more than a hundred bamboo houses were built, which has now become the capital of Basilan Island.

During the reign of King Louis Philippe, France wanted to establish colonies in the Pacific Ocean and sent Dumont d'Urville to Basilan. Rear Admiral Cécille also led a fleet to the vicinity and stayed for several weeks before leaving. Since then, more French people have settled in Basilan, so now there is a village called Buton de la Puente on the island, whose residents are descendants of the French. They speak French, maintain French customs, and raise the tricolor flag on holidays.

The island has many uncultivated lands and virgin forests. The local natives are called the Yakan people, who are still an uncivilized ethnic group living a life of hunting and fishing, distributed among various tribes. There are also many Yakan people among the natives in northern Mindanao and southern Sulu.

The Yakan are a type of Malay, with little difference from Malays, except that young people have darker skin, larger eyes, and are more agile. They wear long robes all year round, and their pants are embroidered with various flowers. They have long hair wrapped in cloth. Women adorn their clothes with shells and gemstones, considering it beautiful.

The Yakan all believe in Islam and are gentle in nature. Some believe that they used to live with the Moro people, but because they could not endure the abuse of the fierce Moro people, they sought refuge in this Shangri-La, hiding in the forests, and have survived to this day.

Since the Americans took control of the Philippines, the northern part of Basilan has become farmland. The island is not in the hurricane zone, and coconut trees are very lush. There are even more rubber trees, all operated by American industrialists. The rubber production is about sixty tons per month. Tropical plants are everywhere, and animal husbandry is still in the experimental stage. In recent years, Basilan's forests have gradually attracted attention, and logging has been undertaken. Someone has opened a large sawmill in Holand, and a large amount of construction timber is transported to various places.

### Writers Who Made Money After Death

— He Kai

Almost every reader who enjoys detective novels knows Edgar Wallace. The speed at which his works are sold now far exceeds that of any other writer in the world. In fact, he died in Hollywood ten years ago.

He is the only writer whose name can be placed above the film title in larger font than the star's name. The name itself has star value. According to one movie mogul, Wallace is the most appealing writer.

When Wallace died in Hollywood, the world was shocked. It turned out that this prolific and popular writer left behind debts of 120,000 pounds, while the estate was equal to zero.

The furniture in his office had to be sold to pay the poultry merchant's bills. His villa in England was also auctioned, but this was still not enough to cover all the debts.

However, Wallace's works have earned so much money since his death that his debts have long been paid off. This novelist, who used to be a news vendor on the streets of London, has an average income of 12,000 pounds per year after his death. A corporation—"Wallace Ltd."—now manages Wallace's interests worldwide.

Wallace used to dictate his novels into a recording machine and then hire someone to transcribe them, so he was able to produce a large number of works in a short time. These works are now selling at a rate of at least 100,000 copies per year.

Wallace is one of the few foreign writers not banned by Germany. Shortly before the German troops entered Paris, one of his works was being serialized in a certain evening newspaper. In the United States, hundreds of thousands of readers eagerly awaited the "next installment" of the long-form serial story adapted from Wallace's works every day.

Thirty of his works have been made into films. None of them made less than a thousand pounds, and his scripts have earned a lot of money in the past few years. Worldwide, public performances of Wallace's plays generate about a thousand pounds in royalties per year. Radio broadcasts of his works are another rich source of revenue.

In a twist of fate, Wallace never profited from writing during his lifetime. Working as a journalist, he lived a poor life. His early works were sold for eighty pounds apiece. Although his longer novels made him rich in his later years, he still lived in impoverished circumstances.

### Brainsville Parrot School

— Zhong Xun

In Brainsville, America, there is a wealthy gentleman named King who runs a parrot school. It is now celebrating its fifth anniversary. Most of the parrots in the school are purchased from Mexico and Central America. Initially, there were only forty pairs of parrots, but they have gradually increased to more than seventy thousand pairs. The scale of the school is also five thousand times larger than before. They are divided into classes and taught English using phonographs, with a graduation requirement of two months. Those who cannot say a few words after half a month of teaching are dismissed. After graduation, most are purchased by museums and antique dealers from various places. Even from faraway Australia, people come to buy them. However, the selling price is very expensive. A total of more than 1.2 million have graduated and gone abroad.

### The Age of the Universe

— Guang Jin

If you want to know the age of a friend, if he is willing to tell you, just say "How old are you?" and you will immediately get the answer you want. If this friend is not a young lady, then what is said is definitely true.

If you want to know the age of a country, it is not difficult either. There are historical records to rely on, and you can get it right away. If you ask how old our New China has been since its birth, the cover of the almanac will show you that it is thirty-one years old.

But if you want to ask how old the universe is? In other words, how long has our universe system existed? This amazing question will leave the all-knowing "Heaven Knows" itself at a loss.

How old is the heavens? Many astronomers in Europe and the United States are working hard to study and want to give an accurate answer. At present, there are two schools of thought:

American astronomers such as Cooper believe that the age of the universe is between ten billion and one hundred billion years. Most of those who advocate this theory are American astronomers, so it is called the "American School." British astronomers such as Jeans believe that the age of the universe is between one hundred billion and ten hundred billion years. Because most of those who support this view are British astronomers, it is called the "British School." The British School believes that the age of the universe is a thousand times greater than the American School, so it is also called the "Long-Term Theory," while the American School is called the "Short-Term Theory."

The Long-Term Theory is based on the time required for the evolution of the galactic system to reach the current state of balance and uniformity, while the Short-Term Theory assumes that our universe has always been fairly balanced and uniform. Since their theoretical starting points are different, it is no wonder that the results of the calculations differ by a thousand times.

How old is the heavens? After saying so much, there is still no conclusion, precisely because they all have their own reasons. Before we get an accurate unknown number, we can only keep a concept in mind. But, in the near future, we will know the age of the heavens, because after these two schools launched a fierce debate, it has greatly aroused the interest of scientists from various countries to participate in the research.

### Random Thoughts on Perseverance

— Fan Ji

Patience should be a resilient "accumulation," not an unlimited "tolerance." It should have times of venting, not perpetual silence. Otherwise, what is the distance between patience and numbness?

An ordinary meal is often regarded as a commonplace metaphor, but when the meal is really a bit "inconvenient," it becomes not "commonplace." The same is true for devotion. The most ordinary things are often the most important things, yet at the same time, they are the easiest to be overlooked.

### Finger Sound Discrimination

— Zhang Qiao

Recently, there is a device that can transform human voices into sound waves, allowing deaf people to use this new tool to distinguish sounds with their fingers. This is of great help to the deaf in the world. This work of transforming human tones into vibrating sound waves has not been achieved before.

### Life

— Xiao Yuhua

Perhaps because I am young, I rarely think about death. Although life is difficult, living is always lovely. Therefore, I lack sympathy for those who cut off their own lives with their own hands.

But, I would also shed tears and listen to some stories about death with an excited heart. On a bright afternoon, the weather was fine, and the world was peaceful. A kind doctor walked the road to death. Facing a destination, he said lightly: Death is not the most unfortunate thing, it is only the last thing.

It's just that the death I've seen lately is unfortunate and terrible. Imagine an innocent life, carrying hope, being born into the world, but the fate that our world has arranged for it is a small piece of resting land.

This is not a strange tale. Any day you walk down the street, you can see people lying there, who have lost their breath—many are children, many are babies.

Is it not too cruel to be born to die? Naturally, humanity itself is cruel. Seeing it too much, you get used to it, and emotions become numb. However, if you can be quiet for a moment and think silently: can you have no feelings at all?

### Sharing the Same Boat Through Storms

— He Jia Zhi

(4) In the Setting Sun

Second Mrs. Ye came in and said with a smile, "I heard a few words outside. Fei Changhe, don't treat the Shi De Tang as a gold and silver vault. Shi De Tang can't be like it used to be in recent years. Besides, the First Mrs. is gone, and money is needed for the initial funeral and the opening ceremony. Young Master Ye doesn't earn money either. How can you expect to get as much as you want? You have to be clear about this." Fei Changhe looked surprised and said, "According to Second Mrs. Ye, I can't say anything more. Then, what Young Master Ye said to me in person on the night of welcoming the God of Wealth doesn't count? This, this..." Fei Changhe pursed his lips, just saying "this" and "that." Wei Cheng said, "Aunt, we won't reason with him now. We'll just give him some money to help him out. If he says it's to pay for Cui Zhen's meals, we won't listen to him; if he says to write a promissory note, we won't listen to him either; if he says to take a hundred yuan first, we won't listen to him. Fei Changhe, what do you say?" Fei Changhe smiled and said, "I will do whatever Young Master Ye says. Young Master Ye is like my own parents. You say how much to give, and that's how much it will be. But Young Master Ye knows that I really lost in gambling, and he won't give me less." Wei Cheng covered his ears, asked Second Mrs. Ye for thirty yuan, and paid him. Fei Changhe put it under the table, counted it, and wanted to argue for more, but his feet seemed to be pulled as he walked, and he immediately thanked them and ran out. Wei Cheng said; "Aunt, to deal with these rascals, I think the only thing to do is to temporize. I don't have the mood to think of a thorough solution right now."

Second Mrs. Ye worried that Fei Changhe had set a precedent. If he didn't have money to spend, he would come to get it. Wei Cheng said, "That's right, but in order for Sister Cui Zhen to live in peace, we can only deal with him like this. If he hasn't lost his conscience, he can't ask me for money every day." Wei Cheng was just saying this when suddenly there was a sound of footsteps outside, and Fei Changhe came in again. Fei Changhe's return to the Ye family was because someone was forcing him to come, and the person forcing him was Huang Long. (69)
