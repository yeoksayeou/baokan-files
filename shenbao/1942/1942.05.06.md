Resistance has been minimal. The British naval forces off the island are led by Rear Admiral Syfret. The land forces consist of regular troops and small commando units, led by Marine Major General Sturges."

London, 5th (Havas) - The British Broadcasting Corporation reported today that the British government's dispatch of troops to occupy French Madagascar was done with the consent of the Allied governments. Regarding the US government's statement that it will return the island to France once the current war ends, or even before the end of the war if the Allies deem it no longer necessary to occupy it, the British government fully agrees. It is also learned that the troops operating near Madagascar are all British troops, with no US or Free French forces included.

Washington, 5th (Havas) - The State Department announced this morning that President Roosevelt was notified in advance of the British military occupation of French Madagascar in the Indian Ocean. "The US government fully approves of this matter and supports it in spirit." The US government informed the French Ambassador to the US, Henry-Haye, last night, stating, "If the island were to be occupied by the Axis powers, especially Japan, it would be a major threat to the Allied nations. The Allied nations are fighting to preserve civilization, which the Allied nations and France have long cherished. If the island were occupied by the enemy, this struggle by the Allied nations would undoubtedly be severely threatened. The island has now been occupied by British forces, and the President of the United States has been notified. This action by the British has the full support of the US government. If the US military or ships need to use the island to safeguard the common interests of the Allied nations, the US government will certainly not hesitate to do so at any time. The US and Britain have also agreed that once the war ends, or even when this occupation is no longer necessary, the island will be returned to France. However, it must be stated that if the French government allows any acts of war against Britain or the United States, the US government will consider it an attack against all the Allied nations. All of this has been instructed to be notified to the French government by the US Chargé d'affaires in France."

Washington, 5th (Reuters) - The US State Department announced today that the French Ambassador to the US, Henry-Haye, has received notification of the British landing on Madagascar.

Joint Communiqué of the British Navy and Army

London, 5th (Reuters) - A joint communiqué from the British Admiralty and War Office stated that the British naval and land forces arrived off Madagascar at dawn this morning. The British have clarified to the French authorities on Madagascar that the Allied nations have no intention of interfering with the French territorial status of the island, and that the island will remain French, as part of the French Empire. It is reported that there are no US or Free French units among the British forces. The Vichy official news agency reported today on Washington's announcement of the occupation of Madagascar but made no comment. The French government has made no announcement on this matter. Madagascar is located 240 miles off the southeast coast of Africa and is the third-largest island in the world, with an area of 180,000 square miles and a population of approximately 2,800,000. It became a French protectorate in 1890, and six years later, it was placed under the administration of a governor-general. The island's economy is mainly based on agriculture and animal husbandry. Minerals include gold, silver, copper, iron, lead, and zinc. The capital is Antananarivo, with a population of over 100,000. Other cities include Tamatave on the east coast, Majunga on the northwest coast, and Diego Suarez on the northern coast.

New York, 5th (Reuters) - The New York Times editorial stated that the battle for the Indian Ocean is about to begin, and the British occupation of Madagascar is of great significance.

Rome, 5th (Havas) - According to the "Il Popolo di Roma," reports that three French warships have arrived off the coast of Madagascar to protect the island from invasion have been confirmed. The island has mobilized its reserves in preparation for a British attack. The island's radio station has ordered the mobilization of all reserve officers and soldiers. Vichy has ordered the call-up of reserves for six months of training, which is unprecedented in Madagascar.

Tokyo, 5th (Domei) - Commenting on the British occupation of Madagascar, it is stated here that this action will further strain Franco-American relations and bring France and Germany closer together. At this point, the Japanese navy has control of the Indian Ocean, and Burma is almost entirely under Japanese influence. It is doubtful what the military value of the British occupation of the island is. However, this action is a direct aggression against France and cannot be compared to the Allied occupation of New Caledonia, as New Caledonia was already occupied by the Free French.

### German Attempt to Cut Off Allied Supply Line; Preparing to Occupy Caucasus Oil Fields, Reportedly Germany Will Exert All Efforts to Attack Britain

Washington, 5th (Reuters) - According to military sources, Hitler's future offensives on the Eastern Front will be limited to reaching the Caucasus oil fields and cutting off the Allied supply line through the Persian Gulf. At the same time, it is expected that Germany will exert all its efforts to attack Britain. If Germany's offensive in the Caucasus succeeds, new oil refineries will be established locally, rather than transporting the oil back to Germany for refining. This would allow German motorized divisions to be supplied with oil immediately, enabling them to advance northward.

Eastern Front Situation

London, 5th (Reuters) - Since April 19th, the Moscow Gazette has mentioned that the fighting has been relatively quiet, and it has not indicated where the front line is most intense. Only news from Moscow reported that the fighting in the Kalinin area (northwest of Moscow) was more intense. Berlin sources said that the fighting on the front line is still purely local in nature, and the situation in the Soviet Union is extremely bad, with German soldiers sinking into the mud, which reaches shoulder height. Soviet communiqués acknowledge that ice and snow are gradually melting in most areas, hindering the fighting. Even the surroundings of Leningrad are like a sea of mud. There have been no major changes in the battle situation south of Lake Ilmen. Today's Soviet midday communiqué only reiterated that "no major events occurred on the front line on the night of May 4th."

Stockholm, 4th (Havas) - In the past twenty-four hours, there have been no major changes in the situation on the Eastern Front. A summary of the situation in each theater of war is as follows: In the northern Luga area, fierce fighting has been ongoing for the past twelve days. However, due to the melting of snow and the muddy roads, the Red Army has had to suspend its counter-offensive. In addition, the Red Army has suffered heavy losses in recent days, with no less than six thousand casualties, making it difficult to continue the offensive for the time being. However, the fighting in this area is not as important as the fighting on the Svir River. In the Kaliningrad area, the Red Army used new-style heavy artillery and attempted to attack under the cover of artillery fire, but all attempts were repelled by Finnish forces. On the Belarusian front, according to official Moscow sources, the Red Army is continuing to advance, and its guerrilla warfare is also very successful. It has occupied three railway stations: Monego (25 miles northwest of Luga), Nevaj and Slubino. In the Leningrad, Kalinin, and Moscow areas, there are only local battles. The claim that the Red Army has occupied Fatesh has not been confirmed by Soviet war reports. No news has been released regarding the battle situation in the Bryansk, Kursk, and Orel triangle area.

### Li Tieh-cheng Appointed Envoy to Iran, Shao Yulin's Remarks

Chongqing, 5th - Shao Yulin, Director of the Intelligence Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, recently issued the following remarks regarding the government's appointment of Li Tieh-cheng as the first envoy to Iran: The relationship between China and Iran, according to historical records, is very long-standing. In Roman times, China and Iran already had trade relations. In particular, the transmission of Zoroastrianism and Nestorianism had long become a spiritual bridge between China and Iran. In June 1920, the two countries signed a treaty of friendship. I would like to especially point out that this Sino-Iranian Treaty of Friendship was the first equal and reciprocal treaty that China concluded with a foreign country during the movement to abolish unequal treaties in recent years. Recently, the war situation has changed, and China and Iran are in the same position, and Tehran has become an important transportation hub among the Allied countries. I believe that the friendly relations between China and Iran will become closer.

Li's Brief Biography

Chongqing, 5th - The relationship between China and Iran began in the Han Dynasty. With the changing war situation today, Iran's position has become increasingly important. The exchange of envoys between our government and Iran is of great significance. At the Political Council meeting on the 5th, Li Tieh-cheng was appointed as the first plenipotentiary envoy to Iran and is expected to take office within the month. The following is a record of Li's resume: Li Tieh-cheng is from Changsha, Hunan.

Special Collection on the Indian Question

### 12. India's Trade and Currency System (Part 2)

Since the outbreak of the Second European War, India has made every effort to support Britain, especially in the industrial field, and has made many efforts. In addition to supplying Britain with the materials it needs in peacetime, India bears important responsibilities in economic warfare. Because its location is of great strategic importance, India has become the center of supply from Egypt to Malaya. Therefore, it has transported a large number of raw materials and manufactured goods overseas, so that the materials produced by Britain itself, especially ships, can be supplied to more urgent places. In this war, the assistance India gave to Britain is different from the previous war in two ways. First, although India's economic system is unsound and far from the economic interests of the Indian people, it has made progress compared with the last war. Second, in the past twenty years, India's industrial products have been much more than before. In this war, from September 1939 to February 1940, the Indian government's supply department's assistance to Britain's materials increased by about two and a half times compared with the first year of the last war. In terms of September and October 1939 alone, the amount of materials India supplied to Britain was equal to the total amount of supplies from 1917 to 1918.

Britain has an urgent need for India's main products: oilseeds, jute, and cotton. India is the country that produces the most oilseeds in the world. In 1937-1938, India exported a total of 940,000 tons of oilseeds, most of which were peanuts and flaxseeds. More than one million Indians are engaged in cultivating jute. Indian jute accounts for 98% of the world's total production. From April 1, 1939 to June 30, India exported 140 million rough jute bags, 57 million yards of jute cloth, and 29,000 tons of jute skin to Britain. During the last war, the value of Indian jute, bags and cloth exported to Britain was 137 million pounds. During this war, the amount of Indian jute and jute products transported to Britain will exceed this number even more, because jute bags are made into sandbags and are necessary for the army, and have a great effect on defending against air raids. Britain is now ordering as many as 100 million jute bags from India, which shows the importance of this product in India's export trade.

In recent years, India's cotton textile industry has developed considerably. In 1913-1914, India imported three-fifths of its cotton cloth from abroad. Twenty-two years later, Indian weaving factories and handlooms were able to produce 5.227 billion yards of cotton cloth, but 150 million yards were still imported from abroad. By 1937-1938, India's cotton cloth was able to be exported overseas. In February 1941, the export value of Indian cotton textiles was 172,000 pounds, and the quality has also improved. As for wool industry products, such as uniforms and felt, they are all exported to Britain for military use.

In many places in India, agricultural products are greatly hindered by seasonal winds. In 1939, there were no wheat exports, but in recent years, some exports have been made, and most of them are transported to the British Empire. Rubber, one of the main military supplies, is also produced in India. In 1937-1938, about 18 million pounds were exported, of which 10% flowed into Germany. Other raw materials, such as leather, glue, coir, wood and other forest products, were mostly transported to Britain, but also absorbed by Germany. In 1937-1938, Germany purchased leather worth 375,000 pounds and glue worth 150,000 pounds from India.

Since various countries have been engaged in military competition, India's manganese exports have increased greatly. In 1937-1938, exports reached more than one million tons, of which 284,000 tons were exported to the British Empire. Chrome ore is also produced in India. In 1937-1938, 41,000 tons were exported, of which 4,200 tons were transported to Germany. High-quality mica is necessary for certain types of aircraft. In 1937-1938, 15,500 tons were exported, of which 1,000 tons were also exported to Germany.

India's oil production is very small, but its coal production in 1937-1938 was about 25 million tons, of which about one million tons were exported. Although production is expected to gradually increase in the future, Egypt, Haifa and Sudan have also ordered from India. However, the coal produced in India may have to be used for domestic industry and cannot be exported. As for the cement industry, in 1910, there was only one small factory in all of India. The output was still very small in 1914. Even in the last nine months of the last war, India's cement output did not exceed 59,000 tons. Now it can produce more than one million tons per year. Other products such as pig iron and steel ingots are also mostly used by Britain.

Since the outbreak of the Second European War, the Indian government has set up special agencies to handle various materials, so that they can meet the needs of national defense and industry. The authorities have also used extraordinary powers to implement a controlled economic policy, strictly restricting imports and tightening control over exports. In short, India's import and export trade has a significant relationship in Britain's economic warfare, and India's trade is also significantly affected by the war. It can be seen from the statistics listed above that India's foreign trade, whether in terms of imports or exports, has changed in quantity and type. However, most of them still meet the needs of Britain during the war. Therefore, India is in a pivotal position in economics.

### A Large Number of Rice Weevils Arrested in the Gujiazhai Garden; Using Sightseeing as an Excuse to Secretly Discuss Attempts to Raise Black Market Prices

Since the war, since Shanghai became an isolated island, food prices have soared wildly, creating an unprecedented phenomenon. Fortunately, the authorities of the two concessions are trying to stabilize and control prices and sell them at parity. However, even under the supervision of the authorities, there are still general market merchants and unscrupulous merchants who secretly raise prices, and poor people cannot live. Recently, a group of rice weevils, because the market is being monitored and cracked down on by the authorities, cannot start. These people have a whimsical idea and secretly summon people in the same industry to Gujiazhai French Park under the guise of sightseeing, to discuss raising the black market price of rice. At about 9:00 a.m. yesterday, when hundreds of people were summoned to gather in the park's teahouse for discussion, the matter was detected by Gui Douquan, a Chinese detective inspector of the French Concession, who immediately led detectives Dai Rongji, Wang Baolin and others to rush to the scene, and managed to catch them all in one fell swoop, arresting as many as ninety-two rice weevils, including Yao Heqing, Wang Maosheng, Chen Jinsheng, and Lin Jinyuan, and brought them back to the police station for investigation.

### Tram Between Concessions and Hongkou to be Connected; Fare Difference Measures are Currently Under Consideration

According to the English-language Great Evening News, the Japanese-language "Shanghai Mainichi Shimbun" reported today (5th) that public concession trams will soon carry passengers across the Waibaidu Bridge, for the first time in five years. It is expected that the tram business connecting Hongkou and the area south of the Suzhou River will be restored in early June. This move will greatly benefit Chinese residents in the Yangshupu district and the general public. As for the method of eliminating the fare difference between the two districts, it is currently under consideration, and the fare in Hongkou will be reduced. At the same time, the trolleybus lines in the public concession, which were previously suspended, are expected to resume operation.

### Cart Truck Workers Courageously Do Good Deeds, Generously Donate to Xin Puyu Hall

The entire group of workers from the Tongyun Company's No. 203 cart, having transported corn to Xin Puyu Hall in the South City, witnessed the hall's well-organized and comprehensive management. It shelters over a thousand elderly, weak men and women, as well as orphaned children, who live together harmoniously and intimately like a family. Moved by this, they voluntarily donated 50 yuan from their hard-earned sweat and labor. The driver, Mr. Shen Zhaokui, also separately donated 10 yuan. Their courage to do good deeds is truly commendable and worthy of emulation. The hall's expenses are stretched thin and its expenditures are vast, so it sincerely hopes that enthusiastic philanthropists from all walks of life will continue to donate, so that it can maintain its operations.

### Dismissed Employee Resents Supervisor, Attempted Assassination Fails

Fang Fengchun, a fireman from Shandong working at the Yangshupu Road branch of the Public Concession Fire Brigade, No. 502, was refused leave by his supervisor, Lin Fuchun, from Nantong, on the 1st of this month. Harbouring resentment, Fang used disrespectful language and repeatedly insulted Lin. Lin reported this to the brigade, which in turn reported it to the Fourth Road Fire Headquarters. On the 4th of this month, an order was issued to dismiss Fang. Unexpectedly, Fang was unwilling to accept this and his hatred for Lin deepened. Subsequently, at around 4 PM, Fang suddenly broke into Lin's room with a dagger and fiercely stabbed at Lin's waist. Fortunately, Lin was wearing a uniform with a leather belt around his waist, so he was not injured. When Fang attempted to stab again, his colleagues, Miao Changqi and Lou Zhangyong, restrained Fang, disarmed him, and reported the incident to the Yulin Road Police Station, which sent Detective Wu Wenfa to arrest Fang and take him to the police station. According to Fang, he was discriminated against by Lin because he was not good at flattery and did not offer gifts, causing Lin to deliberately make things difficult for him. Now that his job has been terminated and he has no means of livelihood, he had no choice but to resort to this measure. However, according to the Fire Brigade authorities, Fang's conduct has been poor, and he has been disobedient to his superiors. Since 1936, Fang's record card has had 21 demerits, so this time they could no longer show leniency and dismissed him. The case will now be　　　　　, in order to set an example.

### Shipping Industry Applies to Organize River Police Corps, Standing Committee to Discuss

This application is currently under consideration by the authorities. It is reported that the association has 174,000 members, and together with the 6,000 boatmen employed by Japanese shipping companies such as the East Asia Marine Transport Company, there are approximately 180,000 people in total. Furthermore, the Standing Committee of the Shanghai Municipal Council's Police Corps will hold its first meeting on Friday at the Council Building.

### French Concession Authorities Announce Issuance of Residence Identity Cards, Starting on the 10th of This Month, Residents Over Four Years Old Can Obtain Them

The French Concession authorities issued a notice regarding the issuance of residence identity cards to Chinese residents. It states that on May 1, 1942, the Supreme Commander of the Japanese Army and Navy in Shanghai issued a proclamation stipulating that from May 10 onwards, anyone wishing to pass through the Japanese military checkpoints around Shanghai must hold a County (City) People's Identity Card or a certificate issued by a corresponding government office. Residents are hereby notified that the French Concession Police Department will issue residence identity cards starting from May 9 of this year. Residents aged fourteen and above should apply to the police station in their residential district. After successful verification, the card will be issued. Each applicant must have two guarantors. For all application procedures, applicants may inquire at their respective police stations. This notice is hereby promulgated for general knowledge.

### Shanghai Municipal Council Budget for This Year (6)

Education Expenses: 12,400 yuan. This sum is to be used for dividing the dining hall of Yucai Public School into two classrooms, requiring 5,000 yuan; for building a bicycle shed at the Chinese Girls' Middle School on Xinjiapo Road, requiring 5,000 yuan; and for resurfacing the playground at the Xinjiapo Road Elementary School, requiring 5,000 yuan. The remaining funds are for minor repairs, converting oil-fired boilers to coal-fired, and various small construction projects.

Road Expenses: 1,000,000 yuan. This expenditure was budgeted at 1,050,000 yuan last year. This year's budget is 1,000,000 yuan, of which 70,000 yuan is for acquiring land to widen and extend roads, and 30,000 yuan is for filling and paving the roadbeds with gravel. However, the amounts listed in the budget are merely nominal, as it is currently impossible to predict when and where new buildings will be constructed, and how much land should be reserved and acquired by the Bureau according to the approved road plans for road construction. The land acquired due to the above circumstances must be filled and paved with gravel immediately. The value of the constructed buildings increases due to the good roads, and the estimated compensation paid for the land acquired by the Bureau must also increase.

Machinery and Equipment Expenses: 245,250 yuan. The largest expenditure in this category is an estimated basic expense of 122,712 yuan for the newly implemented "Police Corps System." Besides this, allocations are primarily for heavily used motorcycles, handcarts, bicycles, tools and workshop equipment, hospital equipment, laboratory equipment, filing cabinets, typewriters, and other office equipment, as well as furniture required for essential services. The most urgently needed and expensive items have already been approved by the Board of Directors and purchased in advance. They are included in this year's budget merely for financial accounting purposes.

Emergency Expenses: 82,500 yuan. This is the total amount allocated for various expenditures required to deal with emergencies. The majority of the funds allocated for this expense are for rebuilding and repairing the Bureau's property damaged during the Wusong-Shanghai battle. The amount allocated last year was 985,000 yuan.

Pension Fund: 8,500 yuan. This allocation is to supplement the old-age pension fund until the stipulated maximum amount for this fund is reached. This is a normal expenditure within the provisional budget. However, the allocated amount only covers the basic portion of the pension; the normally attached exchange rate subsidies are not included.

Debt Repayment: 4,182,780 yuan. This amount is 64,320 yuan less than last year's budget. The funds allocated are used to repay the accumulated fixed deposits this year. However, it is expected that a large portion of the deposits will be renewed and continued. (To be continued)

### Shanghai Municipal Council Grain Office Designates Four Warehouses for Rice Distribution, Corn Distribution to Be Completed Tomorrow, Rationing by Headcount May Be Implemented Next Month

The Shanghai Municipal Council Grain Office continued to designate four warehouses yesterday: Zhejiang Xingye Warehouse, Taikoo Warehouse, China Industrial Warehouse, and Huishan (Wharf) Warehouse, for rice merchants to collect foreign rice starting today. It is understood that Taikoo and Zhejiang Xingye Warehouse are distributing Wuhu rice, while the other warehouses are distributing foreign rice. Once this rice distribution is completed, sales can begin on Saturday.

Corn Distribution

The Shanghai Municipal Council Grain Office issued transport permits on Monday, designating the Laili Warehouse at 15 Suzhou Road to distribute corn. Distribution began yesterday and will be completed tomorrow. By Friday, the 372 rice shops in the two concessions will be selling corn, with the quantity still limited to one and a half liters per person, with no increase.

Increasing the Number of Rice Shops

The Shanghai Municipal Council Grain Management Committee is still considering increasing the number of rice shops in order to alleviate the difficulty faced by ordinary people in purchasing rice. Rationing by headcount is also under consideration by the authorities. If practically feasible, it may be implemented as early as June 1.

Rationing by Headcount

However, as a preliminary step to rationing by headcount, the issuance of resident identity cards must be fully completed. Therefore, it is difficult to say with certainty whether the rationing by headcount system can be implemented by June 1. However, it goes without saying that rationing by headcount is eagerly anticipated by every citizen. If it can be implemented sooner, it would be everyone's wish.

### Artificial Cream Users Registration

The Shanghai Municipal Council Intelligence Office issued a public notice, asking the public to pay attention to Notice No. 5875, published on April 28 of this year, regarding the maximum price limit and user registration of artificial cream. The Council's order requiring the public to register in writing aims to prepare for a planned distribution by headcount. Those writing to register should clearly state their name, address, the number of people in their household under the age of sixteen, and the number of people in their household over the age of sixteen. Users residing in the French Concession should send their registration letter to the Price Control Office at 　Fulu Luli 　　number. Those not residing in the French Concession can mail their letter to Postal Box No. 597, but the envelope must be marked with the words "Artificial Cream Registration." Those who have already registered with either of the above offices, regardless of where they reside, do not need to register again. However, for ease of verification, please also indicate whether or not you have registered with a company that manufactures artificial cream. When applying for registration, there is no need to use a special application form. You can use a blank sheet of paper to write down all the items required by the Bureau. The Shanghai Municipal Council is now making every effort to ensure that all artificial cream is supplied to genuine users. The authorities also wish to warn the public not to try to be clever by registering with both parties or falsifying facts in the hope of deceiving the authorities. Such cleverness and falsification will only cause inconvenience to the registration staff and may result in refusal to issue distribution cards. If the user's current address is different from the one listed on the most recent household survey, please list both the previous and current addresses, indicating which is the new address.

### After Reading the Zhou Yi and Ancient History

— Yin Liang

Modern scholars who study ancient Chinese philosophy often fall into two pitfalls.

Since the introduction of new European and American theories into China, commentators often compare them with Chinese philosophy, or even try to force connections, claiming that "China already had them in ancient times." Mr. Hu Shi praised Zhuangzi's theory of biological evolution, and Mr. Li Shicen praised Laozi's dialectics, all due to this tendency. Others are even more extreme. Chinese people often describe this as "a Chinese person in Western clothes" or "new wine in an old bottle." In fact, the thoughts of Chinese and Western philosophers have their similarities, but due to different environments, the same thought still has its differences. "A Chinese person in Western clothes" does not need to pretend to be a Westerner, and "new wine in an old bottle" does not need to pretend to be old wine.

Philosophy is the study of learning, the science of science. Its purpose is not application, but it can be applied to the entire universe. Therefore, philosophical thought applied to life becomes the philosophy of life. Applied to politics, it becomes political philosophy. Applied to history, it becomes the philosophy of history. The meaning of philosophical thought is difficult to understand, but the application of philosophical thought is easy to understand. Scholars often use a certain part of its application to explain the entire philosophy, which is even more common in China, where "learning is for practical use." Neglecting the fundamental and pursuing the superficial, quoting out of context, is of no benefit to the entire system of philosophical thought.

The Zhou Yi is a pure philosophy. Its entire system of thought lies in clarifying the principle of mutual evolution between the positive and negative aspects of the universe. Its theory is similar to Laozi's philosophy. However, Laozi emphasizes harmony, so he says that all things carry yin and embrace yang, and harmony is achieved through the union of energies. The Zhou Yi emphasizes moderation, so it says to hold on to both sides and use the middle. Pure philosophy can be applied to the entire universe, so scholars throughout history have often applied the principles of the Yi to all of their studies. The general outline of the Yi category in the Complete Library of the Four Treasuries says, "The Yi is a medicine that uses the Way of Heaven to illuminate human affairs. The various divinations recorded in the Zuo Zhuan are probably remnants of the ancient Grand Diviners. The Han scholars spoke of numbers, not far removed from antiquity. One transformation led to Jiao Gan and Jing Fang, entering into auspicious and ominous signs. Another transformation led to Chen Shao, who sought to exhaust the mysteries of creation, and the Yi became detached from the people's use. Wang Bi completely rejected images and numbers and explained it with Laozi and Zhuangzi. One transformation led to Hu Yuan and Cheng Yi, who began to elucidate Confucian principles. Another transformation led to Li Guang and Yang Wanli, who further verified historical events, and the Yi increasingly opened up its arguments. These two schools and six sects have already attacked each other. Moreover, the Way of the Yi is vast and encompasses everything, extending to astronomy, geography, music, military strategy, rhyme studies, arithmetic, and even the alchemy of those beyond the world. All can invoke the Yi to explain their theories, and those who love novelty take advantage of this to enter the Yi, so the interpretations of the Yi become increasingly繁.” Later, Mr. Hang Xinzhai and others even tried to connect it to Western theories to explain the principles of the Yi. The book of Zhou Yi has become an encyclopedia of natural science and social science. Although the effort is diligent, it is not only useless but harmful to the Yi itself.

Mr. Pu Anhu is a leading scholar of Chinese studies. He has devoted himself to philology and textual criticism, and his writings are numerous. Recently, after recovering from a serious illness, he has engaged in the study of the Zhou Yi and established new insights. His spirit is a model for us to admire and respect. His conclusion is that the Zhou Yi is an ancient history of the late Yin and early Zhou dynasties, the era of King Wen, King Wu, and King Cheng, which is unprecedented among those who have studied the Yi. However, although the intention is novel, his method seems to have not escaped the old conventions. Pure philosophy is the science of science, so it can be said to be natural science, and it can also be said to be social science. But pure philosophy itself is only pure philosophy. It is possible to explain ancient history with the Zhou Yi, and it is also possible to explain the Zhou Yi with ancient history. But the Zhou Yi itself is only the Zhou Yi.

Reading Mr. Hu's preface, I learned that he used to teach at National University, compiling lectures on the Yi Jing, which had neither novel theories nor practical uses, and the students disliked it. In fact, once pure philosophy is explained, it is nothing strange. The purpose of pure philosophy is not to seek practical use. If students question it with "What's the use after learning it?" there is really no need to answer.

Having much leisure while sick, I occasionally wrote down my feelings, and I hope the seniors will forgive me.

### Medical Association Assists in Epidemic Prevention Campaign, Provides Free Vaccinations to Citizens

The Shanghai Medical Association, recognizing that epidemics are most likely to spread with the approach of summer, is assisting the health authorities in preventing cholera and typhoid and protecting public health. It has decided to launch an epidemic prevention campaign starting from May 1, notifying member hospitals to provide free vaccinations to citizens. The vaccines used are all provided free of charge by four renowned serum factories in the city: Xinya, Xinyi, Dahan, and Sino-French. It has been reported that various hospitals in the Public Concession have accepted the Association's commission and have already begun vaccinations. These include the Red Cross Third Hospital, Shanghai Epidemic Disease Hospital, Tongde Hospital, Darui Hospital, Dagong Hospital, Dade Hospital, Huilu Hospital, Shoumin Hospital, Shanghai Infectious Disease Hospital, Zhisheng Hospital, Pingji Hospital, Tongde Obstetrics Hospital, etc. In the French Concession, there are over twenty places including the Red Cross Second Hospital, Nanyang Hospital, Yih和 Hospital, Wang Qizhang Sanatorium, Bote利 Hospital, 大 Shanghai Sanatorium, Shangxian Women and Children's Hospital,人和 Hospital, Sheng Sheng Hospital, etc. It is hoped that all citizens in Shanghai who wish to prevent cholera and typhoid fever will quickly request free vaccinations from the nearby hospitals listed above.

### Food Service Employee Arrested for Embezzling Shipped Goods

Merchants from Wenzhou, Zhu Yushan, Dai Yanqing, Song Yangan, Huang Wenzhong, etc., entrusted Wang Maosheng (28 years old, from Ningbo, residing at 29 Baoyu Lane, Dongxinqiao), the head of the food service staff of the Lili Lun ship, with goods including galoshes, quinine tablets, bagua pills, Vaseline, umbrellas, blue cloth, and socks, worth 10,422 yuan, to be transported to Haimen on March 27 of this year, paying a transportation fee of 700 yuan. Unexpectedly, Wang had ulterior motives and embezzled the goods, sold them for cash, and disappeared. Zhu and others reported the incident to the French police, who arrested Wang at his home yesterday at noon and took him to the police station. However, the stolen goods had already been sold for cash and were mostly used up, making it impossible to recover them. The police chief ordered Wang to be detained pending legal proceedings.

### Two Suicides

Lu Xiuqin, a 19-year-old woman from Shaoxing, worked as a sock weaver. She lived with her mother, Lu Xu, 50 years old, in Baokang Lane on Avenue Joffre. Because their residence was too far from the sock factory, they moved to 23 Lane 15, Father Road on April 30 to be closer. Unexpectedly, this displeased the daughter, who suddenly had a suicidal thought. She took Lysol and committed suicide the day before yesterday. Her mother discovered this and sent her to the hospital, but she died before she could be treated. The police vehicle transported the body to the coroner's office. After yesterday's examination, the body was claimed by her mother for burial.

Zhou Jingui, 36 years old, from Wuxi, residing at 3 Lane 29, Xujiahui Road, had an argument with his wife, Li (28 years old), over a trivial matter the day before yesterday. Suddenly, he had a suicidal thought. He took carbolic acid that day and committed suicide. His brother-in-law, Li Baodi, discovered this and sent him to the hospital for treatment, but he died despite efforts to save him. The police transported the body to the coroner's office. Yesterday, his husband claimed the body for burial.

### What to Eat for Good Health

Recognizing that nutrition is extremely important for human health, the Shanghai Youyou Nursery believes that it is crucial to solve the problem of how to obtain nutritious and inexpensive food given the current soaring prices. To serve society, the Nursery's Nutrition Division has compiled a nutritional chart of dishes based on its usual research and the book "What We Eat" published by the Chinese Medical Association. The chart details the amount of nutrients contained in various dishes, the functions and characteristics of nutrients, the daily nutritional needs of children, women, and ordinary adults, the consequences of lacking certain nutrients, etc., providing comprehensive explanations in a detailed table. It is truly the best source of knowledge on the nutrition of dishes. If used as a reference for daily dishes, it will be of great help to our health, and the benefits will often be significant. Anyone who wants this chart can send four cents in postage to the Nursery at 9 Zhengxiu Lane, Kaifeng Road, or pick it up in person.

### Student Receives Assistance for Illness, Studies Hard to Repay Society

I previously sincerely appealed for help due to illness. I am immensely grateful for your advocacy. I am deeply grateful that Mr. Zhou Zhongying generously agreed to provide financial assistance and that Dr. Zhou Shouxiang provided free medical treatment. After Dr. Zhou's detailed examination, I now receive vitamin B injections three times a week. However, asthma is a chronic condition, and it seems difficult to see results immediately. Later, I met Mr. Zhou Zhongying, who inquired about my medical history in detail and gave me sincere and earnest guidance, which made me feel incredibly grateful. I can only study hard to live up to Mr. Zhou's kindness and the expectations of society. Respectfully, Gan Sun, May 4.

### Chinese Herbal Medicine Exhibition: Meaning and Impressions (Middle) - Lecture by Dr. Liu Cuigong

The exhibition is set up on the third floor of the Museum. The layout is not rigid, but arranged according to the order of the Materia Medica. Although there are more than two thousand kinds of herbs in the Materia Medica, many are far-fetched and many are not commonly used. The exhibition displays a total of seven or eight hundred kinds, roughly divided into two parts: The first part is historical, including Daoist immortal herbs, minerals used in Daoist alchemy, and the utensils used in alchemy. Although these are relics of the past, this is the essence of Chinese chemistry, the same as ancient European chemistry. The difference is that European chemistry has progressed to modern chemistry, while Chinese chemistry has not. The second part is the medicines usually sold in Chinese medicine stores. In addition to herbs, there are also pills, medicinal wines, and other exhibits. Among them are rare and valuable items such as ginseng, amber, rhinoceros horn, antelope horn, seahorse, prayer snake, dragon bone, deer antler, musk, ambergris, cassia bark, and dendrobium. There are also medicinal plant bonsai, bird specimens, wasp nests, and beehives, all of which are very beautiful. The third part is scientifically validated and effective medicines. In the past ten years, many Chinese herbs have been studied by scientists. According to the results of Dr. Yiboen's investigation, the drugs studied by Japanese scholars include fangji salt, *Discocleidion ulmifolium*, mandarin orange, *Citrus tangerina*, *Sophora flavescens*, hydrangea, *Akebia trifoliata*, coptis, *Phytolacca americana*, *Achyranthes bidentata*, *Aristolochia debilis*, fritillary, ephedra, *Gleditsia sinensis*, spurge, *Imperata cylindrica*, Job's tears, *Polygonatum sibiricum*, *Nandina domestica*, and asarum. The drugs studied by Chinese scholars include *Illicium lanceolatum*, *Corydalis ambigua*, *Fritillaria cirrhosa*, ephedra, pyrethrum, datura, asarum, fangji, *Tripterygium wilfordii*, perilla, *Kalimeris indica*, *Peucedanum praeruptorum*, bupleurum, *Angelica pubescens*, *Epimedium brevicornu*, angelica, scutellaria, safflower, motherwort, *Lophatherum gracile*, and purslane, *Agrimonia pilosa* etc. This exhibition has everything that should be available regarding scientifically identified drugs, such as *Agrimonia pilosa*, ephedra, *Stephania tetrandra*, camphor, worm repellents such as *Quisqualis indica* and pomegranate peel, antipyretics such as anemarrhena and *Lophatherum gracile*, dysentery treatments such as *Brucea javanica* (bitter ginseng seed) and purslane, lice treatments such as stemona, jaundice treatments such as turmeric, *Rohdea japonica* to replace foxglove, etc. In addition, there are many drugs adopted by the Chinese Pharmacopoeia. The exhibition tries its best to display this part of scientifically validated drugs and labels them with detailed explanations to attract the attention of the audience. In addition to the drugs, the exhibits that can be mentioned are the rare and excellent editions of Chinese Materia Medica from past dynasties, as well as translated versions of the Materia Medica, almost all of which cannot be seen in ordinary libraries. There are also medical books, pharmaceutical equipment, various items related to medicine and drugs, etc. In short, all the exhibited objects have considerable value and meaning. I have hastily described the content of the exhibition, with many omissions. Hearing is not as good as seeing. The audience in Shanghai may wish to visit the exhibition in their spare time and see it for themselves. The impression must be very good. Please allow me to briefly say a few words about my feelings after seeing it.

### Xia Guang Cup Basketball Tournament Opens Yesterday; South China Courageously Defeats Strong Star Team; Girls' Bell Sound Team Beats Mixed Girls Team

The second Xia Guang Cup Basketball Tournament opened yesterday afternoon. A large crowd attended. The League's Close Friends team exerted their utmost effort, defeating the Qinglian team 9 to 3. The Girls' Demonstration team, Bell Sound, defeated the Shanghai Girls' High School incarnation, the Mixed Girls team, 22 to 11. In the men's game, the Strong Star team started strong but faded, losing to the South China team by a score of 17 to 15, by only one point. In the Qinglian versus Close Friends match, Qinglian led 13 to 1 in the first half. In the second half, Close Friends fought valiantly, turning the tables on Qinglian, who seemed to lose all energy. Key players Zhang Jing and Wang Shifang were successively [fouled out/replaced], and Close Friends then defeated Qinglian 29 to 23. In the girls' demonstration match, the Mixed Girls led 6 to 5 in the first quarter. Bell Sound's Wu Ailian and Wei Peiyun rapidly increased the score. The Mixed Girls brought in Zhang Jiazhen, but the point deficit was too large, and Bell Sound ultimately defeated the Mixed Girls 22 to 11. In the men's demonstration match, Strong Star's Huang Peijun opened the scoring. South China made one point from a free throw. Strong Star then scored six consecutive points, leading 8 to 4 at halftime. In the second half, Strong Star's score steadily increased, but this good fortune did not last. South China calmly responded. At the end of the game, South China was ahead 17 to 15, turning defeat into victory. The lineups for the men's and women's demonstration games were as follows:

Commercial News

### Market Sentiment Softens; Gold Market Dips Slightly

Yesterday's spot gold market hovered and declined, with prices falling within the 21,000 yuan range. This was due to the selling by certain cash shops and gangs. Market sentiment was generally soft. At the opening, each bar (ten taels) was initially higher by 100 yuan, at 21,100 yuan. Securities firms moved from 21,050 yuan to 21,200 yuan. Suddenly, gold shop gangs began selling heavily, and another securities firm also sold, pushing prices down by 300 yuan to 20,900 yuan. Money changers and securities firms (on behalf of northern gangs) absorbed the selling, pushing the price up by 350 yuan, reaching 21,250 yuan at 10:45 AM. Then, some gangs began selling heavily again, causing a retreat of 650 yuan, down to within the 21,000 yuan range. The lowest traded price was 20,600 yuan, but soon a securities firm bid up to 20,850 yuan. The final traded price was 150,000 yuan lower than the previous day, a difference of 650 yuan. Trading was thin.

Gold jewelry was still listed at 2,200 yuan per tael by the major new and old firms (purchases were 200 yuan less). Silver was listed at 18 yuan. The black market price had fallen to 15.78 yuan. Silver coins were still at 9.23 yuan each.

### Gold Pound Rises

Yesterday, in the foreign exchange market, British and American gold pounds each rose by 30 yuan. The former rose to 500 yuan, and the latter to 510 yuan. US dollar notes were at 34 yuan. Hong Kong notes were still at 5.23 yuan. Military notes opened at 7.25 yuan in the morning, then rose to 7.28 yuan, then declined to 7.21 yuan, and finally closed at 7.25 yuan, up 2 fen from the previous day.

Yesterday, the Money Trade Association lowered the discount rate again by 1 fen, listing it at 9 fen. The discount rate for checks was lowered by about 5 yuan to 15 yuan per thousand. The price difference between old and new legal tender was 3.23 yuan per yuan.

### Public Bonds Exhibit Hot and Cold Streaks

The public bond gray market rose and fell yesterday, exhibiting a cycle of alternating heat and cold. Outsiders found it difficult to predict. In reality, the situation was quite simple. Those who had previously sold short were now eager to cover their positions, while powerful players occasionally applied high pressure, absorbing bonds at low prices. Some speculators temporarily avoided the fray. After each large decline, a rebound was inevitable. After careful observation of the trend, it appeared that the powerful faction had temporarily gained the upper hand. If more new forces joined in, they could easily conquer the market in one fell swoop. The reason was that after such a large and dangerous storm, the multiple parties had not succumbed, indicating their great strength, which could not be matched by ordinary capitalists. However, whether the storm would end here was uncertain, and their actions should be closely monitored. Yesterday, Class C bonds opened with extremely chaotic bidding. Some bought at 8.80 yuan, while others sold at 8.23 yuan. After some dispute, the market opened at 8.23 yuan, but only 5,000 yuan worth of bonds were traded. In the second session, the price was 8.80 yuan, and then it spiraled upwards. Class D bonds showed the strongest rise. There was not much trading in the futures market. Cheng Kang, Tong Shun, and Tong Kang were relatively strong buyers. Yong Chang, Gong Mao, and Li Da also absorbed some bonds. Tong Yuan, Shun Tai, and Wu He mostly sold first and then bought back. Tong Li was still the largest seller, followed by Xie Kang and Shun Li. Hong Xing, Hong Da, Jiu Feng, Run De, and Yuan He mostly bought first and then sold, but the overall trend was towards buying. Market prices rose by 5 jiao to 2 yuan across the board. Trading volume was still only about 1 million yuan. A concise table is listed below:

### Chinese and Foreign Stock Markets Remain Sluggish

Yesterday, foreign stocks continued to weaken, and trading was not active. A total of 281,000 shares were traded, with 5,300 shares of Chia Ho Spinning & Weaving Co. traded, and the price fell from 43 yuan to 42 yuan. 5,500 shares of Sino-British were traded, with the price falling from 20 yuan to 19.3 yuan. 5,500 shares of Ye Guang were traded at 30.05 yuan. 2,500 shares of Paper Industry were traded at 13.4 yuan and 13 yuan. 3,000 shares of Chia Ho Beer were traded, with the price falling from 13 yuan to 12.5 yuan. 1,150 shares of China Textile were traded at 26.25 yuan and 26 yuan. 1,500 shares of China General Edison were traded at 17.8 yuan and 18 yuan. 100 shares of Shanghai Gas were traded at 18.2 yuan. 100 shares of Tramways were traded at 59 yuan. 500 shares of Woolen were traded at 16.8 yuan. 500 shares of British-American Tobacco were traded at 34.5 yuan and 34 yuan. 200 shares of British-American Land were traded at 22.5 yuan. 2,000 shares of Galendar were traded at 1.8 yuan and 1.88 yuan. 100 shares of Rubber were traded at 24 yuan. There were no other trades.

Yesterday, the Chinese stock market was inactive and flat. Wing On Company was traded at 60 yuan and 61 yuan. Sincere was at 70 yuan. China Underwear fell from 26.5 yuan to 25.5 yuan. There were sellers of Great China Match at 155 yuan. Nanyang Brothers Tobacco was traded at 55 yuan. China Electric Company was at 18.25 yuan. Home Industry Society was around 202 yuan. Kang Yuan Biscuit had buyers at 39 yuan. Qing Feng was at 300 yuan. Bank of China was at 142.5 yuan. Bank of Communications was at 137.5 yuan. World Drug Bureau (new) was at 73.4 yuan. New Asia Materials was at 22 yuan. New Asia Science rose from 17.25 yuan to 18 yuan. New Asia (new) was at 36 yuan and 35.5 yuan. Chinese-French (new) was at 61 yuan.

### Double Horse Factory Single Yarn Experiences Several Changes in One Day

The cotton yarn market is still bullish, but some profit-takers took the opportunity to exit, causing the market to first rise and then flatten. However, the physical goods situation is very stable. Only the prices of Double Horse factory single yarns fluctuated wildly due to speculators' activity, changing several times in one day. This was mostly a trick of speculators. 42-count Blue Phoenix was at 14,150 yuan to 14,300 yuan. 42-count Fairy Peach was at 13,450 yuan. 40-count Colored Ball was at 12,500 yuan. 42-count Precious Light was at 13,600 yuan. 30-count Fairy Peach was at 12,500 yuan. 20-count Blue Phoenix was at 7,500 yuan to 7,700 yuan. 20-count Moon Lute was at 7,000 yuan. 20-count Double Horse was at 6,600 yuan. 20-count Earth was at 6,720 yuan. 20-count Colored Five Sons was at 6,280 yuan. 20-count Heavenly Maiden was at 6,350 yuan. 20-count Precious Yi was at 6,350 yuan. 18-count Weaver Girl was at 6,320 yuan. 16-count Red Kui Xing was at 6,600 yuan. 10-count Red Change Horse was at 5,000 yuan to 5,050 yuan. 10-count Double Earth was at 4,700 yuan. 10-count Boy Scout was at 5,000 yuan. 10-count Three Tigers was at 5,000 yuan. 20-count Double Horse factory single yarn opened sharply higher at 5,800 yuan, but buyers came one after another, driving the price straight up to a new high of 5,980 yuan. At this point, some profit-takers exited, causing the price to ease to 5,740 yuan. Short covering then pushed the price up again to 5,950 yuan. The closing price was slightly weaker at 5,850 yuan.

### Piece Goods Rise Easily and Fall With Difficulty

The fabric market continued to rise yesterday, with no sign of turning back. Because various manufacturers had not been opening for a long time, and costs were gradually increasing, the lack of spot goods created a situation where prices could rise easily but fall with difficulty. In the morning, because the price of Double Horse factory single yarn reached a new high, those holding goods took advantage of the situation to push up prices. Coarse and fine cloth rose by 2 to 3 yuan per piece. 12-pound Earth fine cloth opened at 235 yuan. Fu Gui opened at 230 yuan. Various brands of Shilin cloth also rose by more than 2 yuan per piece. Changshou Fu silk was at 7.65 yuan. Wan Ben De silk was at 8.35 yuan. There were transactions.

East Cloth: Dragon Head fine cloth new orders opened at 291 yuan, then rose to 292 yuan. After taking profits, it fell back to 287 yuan. The afternoon closing rose to 290 yuan. In the afternoon, it started at 290 yuan, fluctuated for a long time, and closed at 288.75 yuan, up about 1 yuan per piece. Colored Ball reached a high of 26x yuan and a low of 256 yuan, closing at 258.5 yuan in the evening. Four Gentlemen serge had the most active trading, and the largest fluctuations, ranging from 9.62 yuan to 9.42 yuan, and closing around 9.5 yuan in the evening.

### Broad Beans and Red Beans Subject to Seasonal Influences

The prices of beans varied yesterday. The supply and demand for yellow beans were both thin, so the price remained flat. The price of broad beans fell sharply by more than 10 yuan because new goods would arrive soon, and those hoarding goods were eager to sell. The price of red beans also fell by about 10 yuan because the traditional makers would soon be distributing their goods. 50 bags of Tianjin Jin Yuan beans were sold at 262 yuan delivered, and 255 yuan for self-pickup. 18 bags of Ben Niu red beans were sold at 210 yuan. 60 bags of Chongming sand red beans were sold at 240 yuan to 232.5 yuan. 50 bags of sand silkworm beans were sold at 140 yuan to 132.5 yuan delivered.

Corn owners continued to raise prices yesterday, but only those who needed them made slight inquiries, so the market remained relatively stable. 100 bags of Saigon new corn were sold at 185 yuan. 3 carloads of Wuhu corn were priced at 175.5 yuan delivered, slightly higher by half a yuan than before.

### Daily Necessities Prices Remain Stagnant

Trading in daily necessities was slack. After the authorities imposed restrictions, the market became stagnant, with transactions occurring, but few sales. In addition, the market was flooded with miscellaneous brands, and the purchasing power of the people was weak. Export inspections were very strict. Although factories had goods to distribute, the quantity was small. For example, Gu Ben soap was priced at 27 yuan military currency per box, and each person was limited to one bar (i.e., two pieces). Users found it difficult to buy because only one box was distributed. As a result, recent selling prices remained stagnant. Mei Li brand matches were trading at 5,650 yuan per box, Fenghuang brand at 5,600 yuan, Gu Ben soap at 310 yuan per box, Bai Xiang Mao soap at 295 yuan, Huang Xiang Mao soap at 265 yuan, Arrow soap at 280 yuan, and Bai Li Shi candles at 180 yuan, all tending to stabilize. Looking at the future market, it is difficult for the prices of these goods to rise further, so business has been slow recently, and ordinary merchants have found it difficult to apply their tricks.

### Hardware Market Experiences Slight Activity

Since October 8th of last year, the hardware industry has been virtually shut down, lasting more than four months. Since this spring, a large number of hardware items have been requisitioned, resulting in a thinner inventory. Recently, the long-dormant hardware market has become active again. It has been learned that "if buyers want to purchase goods, they must inform the purchasing hardware store (fellow tradesmen) of the legitimate use of the goods. Then, the fellow tradesmen must fill out an application form and forward it to the association. After that, they must apply for a Shanghai Materials Movement Permit (the use of the items must be explained in detail). The permit must then be forwarded to the various associations to which the fellow tradesmen belong, and then to the Iron and Steel Industry Control Association, and then to the Asia Development Board before it can be used to transport the goods on the market. The goods specified in the permit are only valid for two or three days. If the permit expires, it cannot be used." The permit is only valid for use in Shanghai, and business with out-of-town merchants is temporarily not allowed. The association's indicative prices (market prices of major commodities) are listed below. Compared to the end of last year, prices have risen by as much as 30%. (Unit: Legal Tender Yuan)

Entertainment World

### Zhang Junqiu Leaves Fufeng Society; Insider Story

— Ni Zhongtang

I have written about Ma Lianliang and Zhang Junqiu in this column before. Here, I will talk about some of the true insider story of Zhang Junqiu leaving the Fufeng Society:

The split between Ma and Zhang, while an unfortunate blow to the pear garden world, also brought good news: Junqiu has formed his own troupe and will debut at the Kaiming Theater in Beijing on March 28. (For information on Junqiu's troupe formation and internal roles, please see the "Zhang Junqiu Forms Troupe" news in this column on the 8th.) Originally, separation and union are not unusual, but at a time when famous actors are as rare as morning stars, the separation of Ma and Zhang is regrettable. It is said that the reason for the split was the issue of remuneration. At the time, Junqiu's fee was 360 yuan per performance, which was an exceptionally good treatment among the secondary dan roles. However, Junqiu felt that the remuneration was not commensurate with his increasing reputation, so he requested 500 yuan per performance, but was rejected by Lianliang, which led to the big mistake and the announcement of the split. After this news spread, many actors, such as Tan Fuying, Shang Xiaoyun, Nan Tiesheng, and Zhang Shi Li Lingfeng, who had already separated from Junqiu, ran around trying to reconcile the two, hoping that Fufeng could be as good as before, but in the end, both sides refused to budge, leading to a parting of ways.

Recently, according to news, in addition to Junqiu still performing at the Kaiming Red Theater in Beijing, the Fufeng side has invited Li Yuru to join the cooperation, with a contract period of one year. According to rumors, the cooperation between Ma and Li has not been as good as Lianliang had imagined. In the meantime, Lianliang must have unspeakable suffering. Unexpectedly, Li Yuru suddenly fell ill at the beginning of last month, which was truly a double blow to Lianliang. Therefore, the entire troupe that went to Jiyuan at the end of last month has invited Yan Huizhu to temporarily replace her.

### Prelude to "Human Desire"

— Peng Ming

After "Gui Qu Lai Xi," the China Travel Drama Troupe originally planned to perform "Peacock Flies Southeast," but due to numerous audience requests, they decided to premiere "Human Desire," a famous American stage play adapted by the young playwright Qingkeng.

"Human Desire" is based on the work of the modern American playwright Sidney Howard. It caused a sensation throughout the drama world and achieved great success when it premiered in the United States. Qingkeng has worked tirelessly and painstakingly to adapt it into a Chinese script. Taking the Chinese countryside as the background, everything from the plot, costumes, and dialogue is tailored to Chinese social customs and habits, without any trace of Western habits, which is truly commendable.

The story tells of the master of a rural farm, over half a century old, who has never been close to women. One day, he happens to meet a waitress at a hotel and is amazed by her beauty. After returning home, he asks a younger friend to write him love letters to propose marriage. When the other party agrees and asks for a photo, he is afraid of ruining the good deed because his appearance is not good, so he secretly sends his friend's photo. Later, the woman arrives and learns the truth, feeling infinite indignation. However, she cannot resist his bitter pleas and has to reluctantly stay. On the wedding night, the groom is too excited and injures his leg. The one who enjoys this precious moment is not the groom, but his friend. These two young men and women had no intention of committing a crime, but they finally could not contain the fire of passion and committed the inevitable and "evil of all evils" affair between people. Later, when the two could not bear the condemnation of their conscience and prepared to leave, the groom discovered the matter. After a moment of anger, he forgave his wife and let his friend leave alone. Because he knew that it was not entirely their fault, it was just "human desire" at work, destroying man-made happiness, and "human desire" is constantly stirring, rushing, and surging in everyone's blood vessels.

The adapted play is divided into four acts, one more act than the original play. The dialogue is tight, the plot is moving, and the characterization is extremely profound. It is full of satirical and humorous jokes. The depiction of human desire, human selfishness, and human brutality can be said to be insightful and penetrating.

### Storytelling Notes

— Jianfan

The Zhang storytelling hall has been reorganized, the lineup adjusted, and the performers are becoming more and more solid! I went to listen the other day. The headliner, Gu Hongbo, told "Civet Cat Exchanging for Crown Prince," with abundant emotion, excelling in the roles. Second was Yan Xueting's "Strange Records." Since Li Daoshi of Runyu Society retired after holding the Tai'a Kang, Yang Naiwu's ballad storytelling had almost become extinct; unexpectedly, Xueting followed up and also told this story. Each "story path" is no different from Bo Kang's "script"; only the compiled chapters are somewhat inferior. As for his narration, local dialect, and humorous jokes, they are all top-notch. That day, he just told the story of Ge Wenqing returning home, hearing the bad news of his elder brother, suspecting many things, and going to worship and inquire about the cause of death. The telling was emotional and thought-provoking! The third act was Zhang Hongwen telling the "Heroes," a lively and resonant story. His telling of "Heroes" is characterized by its briskness, with all three elements - essence, energy, and spirit - being sufficient! He is also good at delivering humorous jokes, and his words are so wonderful that the audience often roars with laughter. Next was Yu Xiaoyun and Xia Kunzhong's "Jade Dragonfly," telling the story of Shen Junqing's glorious return home, meeting his sworn brother Li Dongwu on a boat on the Yangtze River, drinking and reminiscing about the old days, and arranging a marriage between their children. Xiaoyun's narration is light and easy, quite like his teacher Wang Zihe in his younger days. The clean role of Li Dongwu has a coarse and expansive aura, which is overflowing in his words and expressions, creating a lot of fun! Paired with Xia Xia's Sheng Shen Junqing, the storytelling and singing are clear and distinct, complementing each other! Finally, Xu Yunzhi told "Three Smiles: Wen Tang's Trial Examination Article," vividly depicting the awkward character Da Duo Er Diao, making people laugh out loud. The Xia (Liansheng) school is indeed extraordinary! It is said that the lineup for Zhang Yuan in the second half of the year has already been determined, including Huang Yian, Zhu Zhao, Ling Wenjun, and Jiang Ruting, Zhu Jiesheng, and Li Bokang, who have not been on stage for a long time, are all being recruited.

### Listening to Yian's West Chamber

— Eshi

The "West Chamber," written by Wang Shifu, is a timeless masterpiece of love stories, but it is able to be joyous without being lewd and sad without being harmful, quite in line with the words of the "Book of Poetry." In the storytelling world recently, there are three masters of this story: Zhu Lan'an, Huang Yi'an, and He Keren. Lan'an is a storyteller who works as a novelist, so it is appropriate that he should be a step ahead of others. Yi'an died not long after the start of the war.

### Movie Stars' Beds

— Xin Juan

Hollywood's famous dance star Zorina sleeps on a boat-shaped bed that can sway from side to side, just like sailing a boat.

Joan Fontaine, the female lead of "The Constant Nymph," sleeps on a comfortable hospital-style bed.

Humphrey Bogart sleeps on an old-fashioned hammock used for cooling off in the garden - he says he is enjoying his past military life.

Dick Powell, Carmel Myers, and Warren William; their beds are all designed and built by themselves, with bookshelves, medicine cabinets, radios, telephones, and a drawer for midnight snacks.

### Short Biographies of Performers

— Biography by Zheng Guoyi, Illustrations by Zhang Yizhang, Section on Female Performers

(Seventeenth) Lu Sujuan

From the world of courtesans, following Du Liyun's entry into the world of performing on stage, came Lu Sujuan. When Lu Sujuan first appeared on stage, due to the large number of supporters, her momentum was quite strong. Although she and Du Liyun were both female disciples of Wang Yaoqing, their approaches were not the same. Du Liyun studied under Cheng Yanqiu, while she followed the style of Mei Lanfang - even the members of her troupe were mostly the original old performers from Mei Lanfang's troupe. However, she retired after only a few years of performing. Only when Jin Tingsun took over the Golden Theater did she specially come to participate in the opening ceremony, but she never performed in Shanghai. Therefore, people in this area would not be able to hear Lu Sujuan's performances unless they went to the north. Lu Sujuan's face was very beautiful and she was known for her allure in the northern brothels. However, I don't think her stage appearance was so stunningly beautiful as to topple nations. When she came to Shanghai that time, I saw her privately and she was indeed a graceful and charming beauty. Before, probably because she had not been performing for long, she had not yet carefully studied her makeup, which is why I felt unsatisfied.

Miscellaneous Talks on Performing Arts: Lianhualuo by Zefu

Lianhualuo (Lotus Drop) already existed in the Song Dynasty. The Song Dynasty Buddhist text "Wudeng Huiyuan" by the monk Puji states: "Yu Daopo once followed the crowd to consult Langye. One day, he heard a beggar singing Lianhua Le, and he had a great awakening." So, "Luo" was originally "Le" (music), and it was a phonetic error. According to "Wudeng Huiyuan," which is a Buddhist book, since it says that Yu Daopo had a great awakening upon hearing it, this type of song probably originally had the intention of propagating Buddhist teachings, just like storytelling at that time, hence the name "Lianhua" (Lotus). (Lotus flowers are used in many aspects of Buddhism, such as lotus seats and lotus sutras.) Later, it was exclusively used by beggars to entertain people in order to ask for money. When singing, two bamboo pieces are used to strike and create a sound, singing in harmony with it. This is still the case in the south. Those performing variety shows occasionally include it. However, in the north, in addition to this, there are also performers who perform on stage, which is also called "Shi Bu Xian" (Ten Not Idle). During the performance, there are two roles: Dan (female) and Chou (clown). The lyrics also have stories, such as "Three Times Lin Ying," "An'er Delivers Food," and "Wang Xiao Rushes to Work," which are low, graceful, and extremely lewd. Before the Xianfeng and Tongzhi eras, it was highly valued, and it was very similar to the flower drum opera of the south. However, the lyrics are still in a narrative style, rather than speaking for characters, and at the end of each line, there must be words such as "Ai, li liu lianhua ya, yi ya, liu lianhua," which are harmonized by the person playing the bamboo pieces, so it is different from drama. There is another type called "Golden Coin Lianhualuo," which is said to have originated in Shandong. It uses two wooden rulers, struck with several pairs of copper coins. During the performance, two people each hold a ruler, singing and striking, making sounds, which seems to be a different origin.

Ordinary people are not worth mentioning, but now only Yian is unique. Yian is fond of writing, so he can write his own lyrics. Clear and beautiful phrases are easy for him. He is also good at portraying the personality of characters such as Zhang Sheng, Hong Niang, and Qin Tong, both serious and humorous, and can accurately convey them. The Lake Garden Daily originally used Xia Hesheng to describe the phoenix. Yu Shangpeng seconds out a book. One day, he started sending guests from the Law Hermitage. Hesheng has always been known as a leader of the calligraphy world. However, since Yian took over, ticket sales have not declined, which shows his appeal. Stealing life on a deserted island, there is a place to relieve sorrow, and this is harmed to entertain the public.

### Sharing the Same Boat in Storms

— By He Jia Zhi

(Four) In the Lingering Sunlight

Fei Changhe knowingly smiled and said, "These past two days, I've inquired very clearly. Young Master Ye and my niece get along very well: they hold hands like this: and rub shoulders like this; and whisper into each other's ears like this. Young Master Ye, yesterday, close to dark, you two were walking on the edge of the field. I didn't see it, but someone else did." When Fei Changhe said "holding hands," he held his left hand with his right hand; when he said "rubbing shoulders," he rubbed his shoulder against the wall; when he said "whispering," he pursed his lips. His appearance was extremely funny.

Weicheng slammed the table and said, "What you're saying is simply insulting to me and Sister Cuizhen. Who saw me and Sister Cuizhen like that?" Fei Changhe smiled again and said, "If Young Master Ye doesn't admit it, there's nothing I can do, but I've lost another bet. That night, Young Master Ye gave me the money, and I won more than three hundred dollars. I thought Young Master Ye's money was really good, and I might get rich because of Young Master Ye's good fortune. But the next day it didn't work, and the third day it didn't work even more. Now, not counting the old debt, I owe more than one hundred dollars in new debt. Young Master Ye, let's be frank, I don't have any family property. If you want to say I have family property, my niece is my family property." Weicheng shook his head and said, "Stop talking nonsense. I'll just ask you, what do you want coming here? Either you want Sister Cuizhen to go back, or you want money. How much money? I need to write some things and don't have much time to talk to you."

Fei Changhe smiled again and said, "Young Master Ye, you've hit the nail on the head. I want money. Today, I'll take one hundred dollars first. I'll trouble you to get a bank draft, so that the person giving the money doesn't have to bother, and the person receiving the money gets exactly what they need. This money can be considered Cuizhen's past food expenses, or Cuizhen's tea money. After it's recorded, everyone can avoid losses and misunderstandings." After Fei Changhe finished speaking, he sat down on a chair, which was directly facing Weicheng's father's portrait. He saw Weicheng holding his head in his hands, thinking, so he said to himself again, "This photo is really strange, it's like everything except that it can't talk." (68)
