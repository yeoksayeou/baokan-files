Rumors that concentration camps have been established are not true."

### British Aircraft Bomb Axis Powers' Giant Ship

London, 26th, Reuters: According to an announcement by the Air Ministry, our reconnaissance aircraft discovered several giant merchant ships on Friday morning last week, escorted by a battleship, a cruiser, and several destroyers, heading from the Aegean Sea to North Africa. In the afternoon of the same day, our air force and naval aircraft attacked them. The first bomb landed near the battleship, and the ship immediately changed course. Our torpedoes also targeted the ship, but the results of the bombing were not observed. Later in the evening, our naval aircraft spotted the convoy again and bombed each target from an altitude of 4,000 feet. A 20,000-ton giant ship at the rear of the convoy was hit by a torpedo, and flames erupted. It immediately stopped sailing. A destroyer was also hit in the stern, and the explosion was very loud. Before midnight, the convoy was spotted for the third time. Our Wellington bombers attacked for an hour and a half. The giant ship damaged by the torpedo was hit several more times. In addition, a cruiser and two merchant ships were also reported to have been hit. The convoy scattered and fled, and the escorting ships fiercely returned fire with anti-aircraft guns.

### U.S. Secretary of the Navy Warned of Possible Japanese Attack on Honolulu; Naval Authorities on the Island Failed to Conduct Prior Assessment

Washington, 25th, Havas: The Commission of Inquiry into the Japanese air raid on Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, recently released its report, stating that Secretary of the Navy Colonel Knox wrote to Secretary of War Stimson on January 24, 1941, strongly stating that relations between the United States and Japan were tense. If war were to break out, Japan might attempt a surprise attack on the U.S. fleet concentrated in Hawaii. Japanese attacks would take one of the following forms: 1. Attack by bombers; 2. Attack by aerial torpedoes; 3. Sabotage of land-based military facilities; 4. Attack by submarines; 5. Laying minefields; 6. Attack by artillery fire. Subsequently, the military authorities took important measures to protect the islands from air raids. The Japanese Consul General in Honolulu was also engaged in activities harmful to the United States. The Japanese Consul General hired a staff of 200 people for his use last summer, which is clear evidence. As for the course of the Japanese air raid, the Japanese navy and air force participating in the operation included three or four aircraft carriers, many other warships, several submarines, and an estimated 150 to 200 fighter planes, bombers, and planes carrying aerial torpedoes. Most of the damage suffered by the U.S. fleet was caused by aerial torpedoes. The first Japanese attack was at 6:30 AM (Hawaiian time). When a U.S. patrol heard that strange boats had appeared near Pearl Harbor, they identified them as small Japanese submarines and immediately sank them, reporting the incident to the land-based duty officer. The duty officer received the report at 7:12 AM and immediately reported the message to the General Headquarters, but no alarm was issued. At 7:55 AM, Japanese planes officially began bombing. At least two Japanese submarines had entered Pearl Harbor. A submarine protection net was installed in the harbor in early December, but it could only be lowered at night, and it was thought that warships stationed at the entrance of the bay would be able to detect any enemy submarines. As for land-based air defense equipment, it was still under construction and had not been completed by December 7. Therefore, Pearl Harbor did not have a large number of trained personnel capable of performing day and night patrols and prevention work until December 27, 1941. Former Commander-in-Chief of the Pacific Fleet Admiral Kimmel repeatedly received reports stating that the air defense equipment was extremely complete. Although Admiral Kimmel received instructions from the government, he did not examine them. In addition, the Navy Department ordered aerial patrols of Oahu Island, but they had not been implemented before December 7.

### Jardine Matheson's Safe Deposit Boxes Open; Land Deeds and Bankbooks May Be Withdrawn; Legal Tender Must Be Deposited Into Mitsui Bank; Gold, Silver, and Cash May Be Withdrawn

Since the Allied banks in this city were permitted to resume operations, the eight banks, including HSBC, Jardine Matheson, American Orient, Citibank, American Express, China Banking Corporation, Netherlands Indies Commercial Bank, and Hollandsche Bank, have been processing the second round of deposits and withdrawals for one week, which is about to be completed. The American Chase Bank is still processing the first round of deposits and withdrawals. Other banks, such as Sassoon, Mercantile, American Foreign Insurance, and Da Shang, are still in the process of liquidation and have not been able to process deposits and withdrawals. However, safe deposit boxes and securities seals in each of these banks have not yet been allowed to be opened. Jardine Matheson Bank has obtained the consent of the Japanese authorities, and as of yesterday (the 26th), all safe deposit boxes can be opened in succession. However, the objects that users withdraw are temporarily limited to land deeds, passports, bankbooks, and legal tender.

More Than 500 Registered Safe Deposit Box Holders

Jardine Matheson Bank's safe deposit boxes opened as scheduled starting at 2:00 PM yesterday. It is understood that there are more than 2,000 safe deposit box holders in the bank, but the Japanese liquidation personnel, in order to avoid congestion, only allow 30 to 40 safe deposit boxes to be opened each day. Therefore, each safe deposit box holder must register with the bank between 10:00 AM and 12:00 PM each day, specifying the safe deposit box number, and then the bank staff will designate the opening date according to the registration order. At that time, they can bring keys, stamps, etc. to the safe deposit box department of the bank to withdraw the objects that are allowed to be withdrawn according to regulations (if the lease has expired, the rent must be paid). It is heard that a quarter of the registrants were yesterday, accounting for about 500 households. As only 30 to 40 households are allowed to open each day, the designated opening date for the tenants who registered last has been scheduled to the end of the lunar year. The bank posted a notice at the door, writing, "Attention to all safe deposit box holders, opening from January 26 (except Sundays) at 2:00 PM every afternoon, registration in the morning. Tenants who have expired must continue to pay rent."

Notice Stipulates Opening Method

Mitsui Bank and Jardine Matheson Bank jointly issued a notice yesterday, clarifying the regulations on the opening of safe deposit boxes. The main points are as follows: (1) People of enemy countries can withdraw: bankbooks, checkbooks, statements, deposit receipts, passports, land deeds, and Chinese legal tender (must be deposited into Mitsui Bank, and if there is no business relationship, an account can be requested to be opened). (2) People of neutral countries and Chinese can withdraw: bankbooks, checkbooks, statements, deposit receipts, passports, land deeds, local stock securities (limited to Chinese legal tender), legal tender (must be deposited into Mitsui Bank, and if there is no business relationship, an account can be requested to be opened). (3) People of any nationality are prohibited from withdrawing: gold, silver, jewelry, and currency; U.S. dollar bills and British pound bills; and valuable securities denominated in foreign currencies.

Transferring Legal Tender to Mitsui; Interest Rates Clarified

Mitsui Bank, the Japanese bank that is clearing Jardine Matheson Bank, stipulates that the legal tender of Jardine Matheson Bank's depositors and those who have taken it out of the safe deposit boxes, must be deposited into the bank. Therefore, it has now stipulated the interest rates for deposits of people of all countries: for Chinese and people of neutral countries, the weekly interest rate for current deposits is 1%, the weekly interest rate for savings is 2%, and the weekly interest rate for fixed deposits is 5%, limited to new deposits.

HSBC Safe Deposit Box Opening; Currently Under Negotiation

Yesterday, reporters inquired with the British HSBC Bank about when the safe deposit boxes of the bank could be opened. According to the bank staff, the person in charge is currently negotiating with the Japanese clearing personnel at all levels. Presumably, since Jardine Matheson has been opened, the bank may be allowed to be opened by way of example. The date of implementation is not far away.

### Raid on a Bandit Den on Avenue Edward VII, Sixteen Bandits Arrested, Long History of Robbery, Numerous Unsolved Cases

The Shanghai Municipal Council Police Department, in conjunction with the French Concession Police Department, raided a bandit den on the Friday and Saturday of last week, arresting sixteen bandits. Two women were also present in the house and were taken to the police station along with the bandits. It is reported that the successful raid was due to the efforts of a Chinese detective. This detective was investigating another case at a residence on Avenue Foch when he saw five men running out of a neighboring house. Suspecting something amiss, he secretly followed them. The five men turned into another location and finally arrived at No. 68 Avenue Edward VII, where they did not emerge. It was later learned that a robbery had occurred at the residence on Avenue Foch from which the five men had fled. The police ordered the detective and several others to surround No. 68 Avenue Edward VII. When they entered the house, they found no one. The detectives waited patiently and eventually arrested all sixteen bandits. According to one bandit, a large lead box was found in a room at No. 1642 Avenue Edward VII, containing a Mauser rifle, two automatic pistols, and a large quantity of ammunition. This gang of bandits had been committing robberies for a long time, and there are many unsolved cases. It is also reported that this case will be heard this week.

### French Ships Arrive in Shanghai

Shipping lines between this city and various ports in Europe, America, and Southeast Asia have been severed since the outbreak of the Pacific War on December 8th of last year, a period of over four months.

The number of applicants is around three thousand per day, with yesterday being particularly high, reaching a record of over three thousand. From the entrance on Fuzhou Road, up the stone steps, and to the first-floor corridor, applicants formed long queues. The majority were returning to Ningbo. Many who had obtained permits but were unable to secure boat tickets to Ningbo returned to the office to complain about their stranded situation. Yesterday, some people petitioned the authorities, hoping that the "Moufu" ship, detained in Zhoushan, could be released to return to Shanghai and transport those stranded in Shanghai directly to Ningbo, so that they could return to their hometowns as soon as possible.

### Student Aid Applications Closed Yesterday, Continued Appeal for Support from All Sectors, Increased Tuition Fees at All Schools, More Applicants, Strict Selection, Continued Hope for Social Sympathy and Donations

Since the launch of the second "Shen Bao" Reader Student Aid program, due to the general weakness of social economic strength and the recent sluggishness of various industries, coupled with the approaching Lunar New Year, the number of application forms received from students has multiplied compared to the previous session. This newspaper, with its benevolent heart of "treating the hunger of others as one's own," has generously donated, but still feels the sentiment of "how can one obtain a great shelter to make all poor scholars in the world happy."

Filling Out Forms: Many Incomplete

Therefore, the investigation and review of this session must be strict. There are many students who have completed the forms completely, but there are also not a few who have been perfunctory. For a poor student who studies hard, the urgent desire to study for their own future and the failure to take the formalities seriously, strictly speaking, this student is suspected of not cherishing themselves.

Old Student Performance: Fair Review

In addition, those students who were granted student aid in the first session and have excellent performance this session may continue to receive assistance. At least a small number of students who have been frequently absent from class and have mediocre performance cannot be helped. All these situations will be fairly and carefully reviewed. It is hoped that all the students who apply will pay attention to this.

Appeals: Hundreds Arriving Daily

In recent days, hundreds of letters have been received from students, either without a return address or describing their family situation and appealing for assistance. Some have not even read the student aid measures announced by this newspaper daily, causing the staff handling the student aid to reply to hundreds of letters every day. This situation is a waste of manpower.

Form Regulations: Many Are Not Familiar

It should be known that filling out the application form requires the applying student to come to the newspaper office in person to obtain the form and fill it out according to the instructions. This has been published in the newspaper many times. If one can pay attention to reading the newspaper, there would be no need to inquire by letter. In the future, students will have to serve society. Today's carelessness is also a weakness in future service. It is hoped that the students will correct this. Although the staff is overwhelmed with paperwork, we will continue to do our best. If we can eliminate the students' habit of carelessness, it is what we deeply desire.

Continuous Processing: Investigation and Interview

As for the application deadline, it ended on the 26th. The letters received from students on the 26th cannot be processed. From today, we will no longer accept registration forms. We are now rushing to conduct investigations, interviews, and reviews. The date when the approved list is announced will be the date when payments begin. Those who are not approved will not be notified separately. Please pay attention.

Pacing Around: No Solution

There is still more to be said. The number of applicants in this session is double that of the past, and tuition fees at all schools have also increased sharply. The accumulated savings are not much. The staff examines the forms, which are piled up like mountains. Among these thousands of poor students waiting for orders, we do not know who can be selected and who will be forced to drop out of school. Therefore, we pace around the room, unable to find a solution. We feel like a clever housewife who cannot cook without rice. We also fear that we will barely be able to cope with this session and will have nothing to continue with in the next session.

Eagerly Hope: Generous Donations from All Sectors

The staff also knows that the social economic strength is weak and there is nothing to donate. However, we believe that education is a century-long plan and youth is the pillar of society. If we do not cultivate them, it will be a loss for the future. The readers of this newspaper have worked together to create this great act of righteousness. Looking forward to the future, how can we bear to let it be interrupted? Therefore, we urgently appeal, hoping that all sectors will generously donate funds so that we can manage the current situation and have a foundation for future sessions. Readers are understanding and will definitely support us. The donations received yesterday are listed below: Mr. Tian Suiting, $200; Yongshengxiang Company, $50; Mr. Pei Yunqing, $40; Xia Xingfang, $40. The above totals $330. The previous balance was $52,501.37. The total is $52,831.37.

### Beggar Grabbing Food Beaten to Death by Passerby

At around 11:00 AM yesterday morning, in front of the Lu Gaojian meat shop on Xinzha Bridge Road, a beggar (approximately 30 years old) was stopped and severely beaten by a passerby for grabbing food from a woman's hand. Unexpectedly, the blows struck a vital spot, and he immediately fell to the ground and died. The patrol officer summoned an ambulance to send him to the hospital for an examination. After confirming the death, he was sent to the morgue for an autopsy, and the assailant is being investigated.

### Gang Purchasing Rice Using Counterfeit Money, Seven or Eight People Detained

At around 10:30 PM the night before last, a man from Jiangbei named Meng Xiaorong transported five dou of white rice from Longhua to Shanghai to sell. When he arrived at the intersection of Malan Road and Xujiahui Road, three ruffians pretended to buy the rice. They agreed on a price of $19.50 per dou, totaling $97.50. They paid with a new legal tender $100 bill from the Bank of Communications and were given $2.50 in change, while another accomplice took the rice away. Meng did not know how to distinguish real from counterfeit currency. He went to a nearby tobacco shop to check, only to find that the bills were counterfeit. A dispute arose, and the patrol officer from the nearby post arrived and detained one person, identified as Hang Xiaoming, who lived on the third floor of No. 17 Gongji Lane, Xujiahui Road. Five hundred dollars in counterfeit money were found in his residence. He confessed that he and his accomplices specialized in using counterfeit money to deceive villagers in the two settlements. The number of people they have deceived is countless. Six or seven of his accomplices were subsequently apprehended and taken to the police station for investigation.

### National Rice Gradually Decreasing

Yesterday, national rice arrived in an endless stream, and the goods that arrived on the previous day's holiday were also reported for sale together. Therefore, in addition to the inventory in the market, more than 300 shih of new goods were sampled. In addition, the solicitation along the way and direct allocation did not decrease due to the rain. Therefore, although the official selling price of foreign rice has increased by 2 jiao per 3 sheng, the national rice market has become weak. In the early and late rice areas of Nanlu, Sijing, Qibao, and Qingpu, the price of the unified small rice was 23 yuan. Early rice ranged from 193.5 yuan to 192 yuan, while thin rice ranged from 194 yuan, 193 yuan to 192.5 yuan.

### Government Bonds Slightly Weakened

The government bond dark market was slightly sluggish yesterday. Yesterday, Type B rose again above the closing price on December 6, and some bulls closed their positions, so the situation was not as strong as before. It was heard that the 12th period interest coupons due at the end of the month might not be collected. The market still often trades with interest coupons.

### Yarn Industry Busy Registering, Transactions Quiet

The yarn market was mediocre, and transactions did not progress. This was because traffic on the roads was difficult, and buying and selling was blocked, resulting in quietness. The market will recover after the entire solution is announced. On the other hand, the industry is busy with registration procedures, and business is even more bleak. The original price of 20 count Double Horse factory yarn was 1,400 yuan, but it weakened to 395 yuan. Finally, someone wanted it for 400 yuan. As a result, it fell by 30 yuan compared to the previous day. The current price of 20 count Double Globe was 1,970 yuan, Double Horse was 2,055 yuan to 25 yuan, Yueqin was 2,295 yuan to 75 yuan, and 42 count Blue Phoenix was 3,960 yuan.

### Cloth Industry Emotions Uneasy

--Spot Goods Have Risen Without Falling--

The cloth merchants in the factory cloth industry were busy registering the detained goods yesterday, and their emotions were uneasy. Transactions were even lighter, but merchants were unwilling to sell their goods easily, so spot goods have risen without falling. For example, 16-pound Samsung coarse cloth was priced at 102 yuan, Shuanglong at 100 yuan, and Xilin cloth and other blue cloths continued to rise by 35 yuan per piece. Xiaoji blue cloth was priced at 151 yuan.

Eastern Cloth: The sales momentum of dyed products continued to be strong. More than 300 packages of medium-grade fine cloth were traded, so the spot market has also become gradually lively. The afternoon closing price of 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth factory yarn was 83 yuan, up 1 yuan from last week. The spot prices of Longtou and Feiwei, Caiqiu, and Yanghe all require 90 yuan and are still in short supply. The highest price for the Sijunzi serge warehouse receipt was 2.83 yuan, up 8 fen per yard, while the spot goods were slightly weaker, priced at 3.1 yuan. The total transaction volume was approximately 100 boxes.

### Walnuts and Walnut Meat Rise Together

The market for walnuts has become more active recently due to the scarcity of arrivals, and the market trend has turned upward. Southern walnuts opened at 160 yuan yesterday, and walnut meat was sold for 530 yuan, a rise of 60 to 70 yuan. Hand-picked peaches were 240 yuan, and Changping peaches were 220 yuan.

### Tobacco Bureau's Hoarding Becomes Even More Severe

The rise in cigarette prices has become more severe, and transactions at retail stores have also been sparse. Those who hold the goods are hoarding them even more severely. There is still no news of Yizhong's resumption of business.

### The Future of Female Bank Employees

—Si Hua

It is rumored that the Shanghai Banking Association is about to make a personnel decision, with the dismissal of female employees in the banking sector being at the top of the agenda. The trend is that the dismissal is likely to become a reality. If this measure is implemented, there will be no more female employees active in the banking sector, at least temporarily.

The reason for the dismissal is the sluggishness of business, and female employees are in a secondary position. Under the current working conditions, it is no longer necessary to continue employing them. A secondary reason is that the dismissal of employees (referring to male employees) often adds to the severity of the social unemployment problem, which may cause unimaginable consequences. Female employees, on the other hand, have some support, and even if they suffer unemployment, the degree of difficulty is not as deep as that of men.

Before the facts are revealed, making any guesses or criticisms is futile, but women have become the group most severely hit by the wave of unemployment, which is further confirmed by the news. The problem of female employees at the post office once attracted attention, and some female leaders argued their case, but the matter has not yet been resolved satisfactorily. Now, the problem of dismissing female bank employees is also enough to attract the attention of some people in this city, but if the dismissal is actually implemented, I am afraid it will be impossible to reverse!

Female employees of women's banks are another matter, because they can control themselves and do not have the distinction between men and women like employees of other banks. This is not to make a contrast by deliberately using women's banks. In fact, the discussion of the question of women entering society versus returning to the kitchen can consume the lives of the discussants, and it is still questionable whether the conclusion can meet the highest ideals.

### Begonia

— Qin Shouou

Seventeen　Destination

Basically, his chills and fever had not subsided, nor had his coughing up blood stopped. It's just that each time he coughed up blood, Qiu Haitang would spit it into scraps of paper, knead them into a ball, and throw them under the bed. Every night, after Mei Bao went out, he would pretend that it was phlegm and ask the Han family's girl to sweep it away for him. Therefore, Mei Bao never knew and always thought his coughing up blood had stopped. At the same time, Qiu Haitang's insomnia also became particularly severe after his illness. Often, he couldn't sleep for more than two hours in a full twenty-four hours. He himself knew that this was a fatal ailment, but he never told Mei Bao, and he never intended to.

As for what he wanted to ask Mei Bao? First, why was business so good these past ten days or so? Mei Bao often went out with Old Man Han around eight or nine o'clock, and hurried back before ten thirty. When asked how much she earned, she always said thirty or forty dollars every day, which was really abnormal. Qiu Haitang, a person suffering from lung disease, was always very clear-headed, and of course, he felt surprised. Second, in the last two days, he secretly observed that Mei Bao seemed very excited, but suddenly, with an excuse, she insisted on taking the Han family girl with her every night when she went out, leaving the Han family's old lady to come upstairs and take care of him. Both of these points equally perplexed him. However, he always knew Mei Bao's character; this money was definitely not from illicit activities, and there must be her reason for Mei Bao taking the Han family girl with her, so he still patiently refrained from asking.
