### Japanese Troops Land at Three Locations on the Northern Coast of Java

Major Land, Sea, and Air Battle Underway

Saigon, 1st (Allied News Agency telegram) - A Batavia dispatch broadcast by a San Francisco radio station states that the Dutch East Indies government has officially acknowledged that Japanese troops have landed on the northern coast of Java. However, the landing locations and the number of Japanese troops are unknown.

Bandung, 1st (Reuters telegram) - The Dutch East Indies government issued a public statement today stating that after yesterday's naval battle in the Java Sea, Japanese troops landed at three locations on the northern coast of Java last night. The Japanese landing was met with resistance from Allied naval forces.

Bandung, 1st (Reuters telegram) - Allied air and naval forces fought fiercely with the landing Japanese troops throughout last night.

Batavia, 1st (Reuters telegram) - The Battle of Java is currently being waged on land, at sea, and in the air. Despite fierce resistance from Allied fleets, Japanese transport ships, under escort, managed to reach the northern coast of Java. Japanese troops are disembarking and are currently facing resistance from defending forces. It is reported that Allied forces are attempting to repel the Japanese fleet, and the naval battle has been ongoing for thirty-six hours. The skies over Java are filled with the roar of aircraft day and night, as Allied planes shuttle between Japanese bridgeheads and their bases, constantly reloading ammunition and refueling for battle. The vanguard of the landing Japanese troops consists of elite units well-trained in amphibious warfare, supported by dense Japanese air cover. These Japanese aircraft are reportedly taking off from airfields captured by the Japanese in Sumatra, Bali, and southern Borneo. It is reported that the land battles are currently quite chaotic. The Japanese have chosen landing sites crisscrossed by small rivers and dotted with coastal highways. Some Japanese troops may have already infiltrated the area. A communiqué issued by the Dutch East Indies military headquarters stated that the Japanese launched their attack on Java last night.

Saigon, 1st (Haitong News Agency telegram) - Japanese troops landed in Java this morning, a prelude to the attack on this important Dutch East Indies island. The importance of Java is universally recognized, with a population of 42 million, compared to the total population of the Dutch East Indies of only 60 million. Java has a total length of 1,060 kilometers and a maximum width of 200 kilometers. The capital, Batavia, has a population of 500,000, while Surabaya is a major seaport and naval base, as well as the headquarters of the army, with a population of approximately 300,000. Java is extremely rich in resources, although the quantity of raw materials produced is not as significant as the oilfields of Borneo and Semarang, or the tin mines of Bangka and Belitung.

Tokyo, 1st (Allied News Agency telegram) - The Japanese Imperial General Headquarters announced at 4:00 PM today that as a result of the naval battle off Surabaya, Java, on the 27th and 28th of last month, as of this morning, it is confirmed that three enemy cruisers and six destroyers have been sunk, and four enemy cruisers have been heavily damaged.

British Emphasize the Importance of the Indian Question

London, 28th (Havas telegram) - Sir Walter Layton, former editor of "The Economist" magazine, submitted a letter to Prime Minister Churchill today, proposing a new plan for the Indian question. He argued that matters relating to India should be transferred from the India Office to the Dominions Office, and that the Indian Executive Council and provincial governments should be thoroughly reformed. At the same time, he stated that the issue of the Indian Federation should be left for post-war discussion, and that for the present, only the so-called "British India" portion should be designated as a dominion.

London, 1st (Reuters telegram) - Attlee recently published an article in the "Times" Sunday supplement, stating that it is regrettable that important Indian leaders have not been granted the status of (free) defenders in the long run, both in Britain and among our common friends. We are now at a critical juncture, and we should no longer dwell on the reasons that have hindered cooperation between Britain and India in the past. Since the outbreak of this war, the trend indicates that after the Allied victory, India will have a good opportunity to participate in international politics. If the Allies fail, India's fate will be reversed, perhaps for centuries to come. The situation is the same for us. India now has direct diplomatic relations with the United States and stands on the same front with its great neighbor China. There is no need to worry excessively about its post-war status. India is now at a critical moment, and its great allies are supporting it. This is a good time for its people to rise up.

### Hua Weier Discusses the Qualities of a General (8)

One should not hesitate to praise subordinates verbally or in writing for their praiseworthy qualities. He should make as much contact with his subordinates as possible to create a good impression. Red tape also has its uses, but one should never use sarcastic tones when addressing subordinates; such cleverness is harmful to both parties and will inevitably provoke anger. One should always tell the truth, unless it is necessary to keep secrets, such as battle plans. During the last war, what displeased soldiers the most were the propaganda materials from the intelligence department that portrayed the morale of German soldiers as low, because they clearly knew from the front lines that the fighting power of the German soldiers was still very strong!

In short, the relationship between a general and his subordinates is very similar to the relationship between a rider and a horse. Horses not only need to be disciplined and trained, but also encouraged. An old hunter's saying goes: "Kept in the stable, it seems worth five hundred pounds; galloped under the saddle, it seems not worth half a penny." From the horse's own comfort, it not only knows whether the rider's skills are excellent, but also whether the rider is brave or cowardly, decisive or hesitant. A general must sometimes drive his soldiers, just like riding a horse; and the best riders and horse owners are not necessarily the people who love horses the most. A general has ways to make his superiors believe in him, to believe that he is a good commander; but without real ability, he cannot make his subordinates say that he is a good commander.

Three · Generals and Politicians

This time I want to talk about the relationship between senior commanders and superiors, what is called superiors refers to politicians who lead the war, this is another controversial and difficult to solve problem. As you all know, the relationship between British generals and politicians in the last war was very disharmonious. Generally speaking, politicians always blame generals for being narrow-minded and holding military prejudices, while generals tend to attribute many difficulties to "political interference." This friction between politics and military affairs is a relatively new wartime problem, which is a characteristic of democracy, not autocracy.

In ancient times, there were very few disputes between politics and military affairs. In fact, soldiers and politicians were often indistinguishable. Those who have read ancient Greek history must know about the Peloponnesian War between Athens and Sparta. Regarding that war, there is a story about Cleon and Nicias of Athens. At that time, Cleon was the leader of the opposition party and often criticized the conservative Nicias. Nicias wanted to eliminate the attacks of his political enemies, so he retorted, saying: "Okay, then let you command the three armies, and see if you can do better." Unexpectedly, Cleon actually agreed and started a fortunate great victory. This was unfortunate for Nicias, but it did not have a good result for Athens in the end. In ancient Rome, military officers had to serve as administrative officials at all levels first. When there was a vacancy for a general, it was selected from administrative officials. Macaulay described the very wise measures taken by the elders of the city when the city encountered extraordinary events in "Songs of Ancient Rome": In the autumn of crisis and survival, it is best for someone to take power. Let us elect a dictator, and everyone must obey. Give him six months as dictator, and no extensions are allowed when the term expires, known as the hero of knights, holding twenty-four axes. Isn't this method very simple? If modern dictators still had such term limits, perhaps Europe would be much more peaceful.

In the earliest democratic countries, a general's plan was reduced to a pie in the sky due to political negligence. The history of Hannibal can serve as the first proof. For many years, the monarchs of countries often personally led their troops to war (for example, Alexander, many former English kings, Cosdoff II, etc.), and naturally there would be no problem of political interference. Marlborough's position was quite peculiar. In addition to serving as the commander-in-chief of the army, he was practically no different from the foreign minister, and the country's foreign policy was decided in his headquarters. When he was at his peak, he also held power in domestic politics equivalent to that of the prime minister. However, due to the interference of Dutch politicians and the hostility of domestic political enemies, his plans were repeatedly sabotaged, which I am afraid other generals have not experienced. He was able to deal with all this calmly, just as he showed on the battlefield. Although he had many faults, he was truly a great man; and in my opinion, he is undoubtedly the greatest military genius in England.

Generals who interfere in politics have always been cursed by the British military tradition, but most of the famous British generals have had political experience. Before becoming a soldier, Cromwell served as a member of parliament for many years. Marlborough, whom we just mentioned, had far more experience in political conspiracies than military experience when he started his military career. Wellington served as a member of parliament in Ireland and England. Moore and Crawford both attended parliament; so did Graham, the victor of Barossa (later Lord Lynedoch), who was already forty-four years old when he first took command of the army. Conversely, in the French Revolutionary Wars, we saw that political commissars often hindered military work. This phenomenon only disappeared when Napoleon raised himself to be a dictator, whose term was not six months but a general "during this period."

My search for things in war history is no different from a hunting dog chasing an island, so the next example is about the American Civil War. The relationship between the great and intelligent Lincoln and his subordinates is really worth studying. After several trials, he found a general he could trust, and he listened to his command and did not interfere in the slightest. This general was Grant. Listen to me read a passage from Lincoln's letter to his general, and I think his character can be seen from this.

### Ningbo Natives Depart Shanghai for Hometown

Zhenhai Limits the Quantity of Items Carried

The two concessions are sparing no effort to evacuate the population. The Shanghai Municipal Council's Chinese Evacuation Association has recently increased the number of public groups entrusted to issue passes, so that citizens can apply nearby. Since the 16th of last month, the issuance of half-price passes has been limited to factories. Now, citizens of other occupations who leave Shanghai can also apply for issuance, in order to exert the effect of evacuation. The Shanghai Municipal Council's office for issuing return home passes was still issuing passes as usual yesterday, although it was Sunday. Other branch offices are also issuing them. As for the social groups entrusted to issue passes, such as the China Travel Service and the Chinese Educational Morality Society, the number of applicants is also very crowded.

Attention to Passengers Leaving Shanghai for Ningbo

According to news from Ningbo groups in Shanghai, because the concession authorities are evacuating citizens who do not need to live in Shanghai, the number of natives from various counties in Ningbo returning to their hometown is thousands per day. However, the journey is difficult, and those who are not used to traveling are easily deceived. It is found that Shanghai-Ningbo ships are now mostly docked at the Yangtze Wharf. The company's barges pick up and drop off passengers at designated wharfs on the Bund. However, because the boats are small and there are many people, they are often crowded. The old, the weak, or those carrying a lot of luggage all complain. According to experienced travelers, it is best for four or five people to hire a sampan to go directly to the Yangtze Wharf with several pieces of luggage. It is best to hire the sampan at the Lengjing Wharf. It costs about eight or nine yuan from the Bund to the Yangtze Wharf. It is learned that the Mingmen Maru has been directly docking at the Taikoo Wharf on the Bund of the French Concession since this shift. Passengers can directly board the ship. Other ships such as Haitong and Wanji still need to be transferred.

Zhenhai Limits Items Carried

Zhenhai has set the following restrictions on the quantity of items carried by passengers from Shanghai to Zhenhai Port: The quantity of items each passenger from Shanghai to Zhenhai is allowed to carry is: three yards of cotton cloth (i.e., nine feet, equivalent to eight and a half feet in the market), two ounces of cotton yarn (about one-sixth of a pound), three yards of rayon cloth (i.e., nine feet, equivalent to eight and a half feet in the market), the same as above for woolen fabrics (i.e., woolen fabrics), two ounces of woolen yarn (about one-sixth of a pound), one hundred cigarettes, twenty-five Lvwei cigarettes, five small boxes of matches, one catty of sugar, one catty of salt, one package of foreign candles, six bars of soap (for laundry), 200 watts of wax candle raw materials, five he of cooking oil (about twelve taels). It is also learned that the quantity of items each passenger from Ningbo to Shanghai via Zhenhai is allowed to carry is: one dou of rice, two dou and five sheng of wheat, seven sheng of beans, twenty eggs, one catty of tea.

### Factory Survey About to Close; All Factories Should Report Immediately

The French Concession authorities issued a notice: "For the purpose of notification, all owners and managers of factories in the French Concession who intend to continue operating their enterprises in 1942 are requested to apply to the French authorities for registration. The registration form for the raw materials they need each month can be obtained from the Food and Price Management Section at No. 2 Fuli Road. After the form is filled out, it should be returned to the section by the person in charge. As for the amount of coal needed, regardless of whether it has been registered before, it should also be stated clearly. The registration will close on March 7. In the future, the supply of raw materials will be based on the exact number filled in, so those concerned should fill in the form quickly and carefully. Please inform everyone."

### Annual Meeting of Money Exchange Industry in this City

The money exchange industry in this city held its annual meeting at Wanli Restaurant on Fuzhou Road at noon yesterday. One hundred and two member companies of Fulushouxi industry members attended. During the meeting, opinions were exchanged, the business policy for this year was determined, and many cases were discussed. The meeting started at 12 o'clock noon. Chairman Pan Bingshen delivered a speech, encouraging the industry members with three points: The business policy of the industry this year should be based on stability; the industry members should cooperate sincerely; help each other and love each other, and overcome difficulties together. Standing Committee member and manager of the money exchange industry reserve bank Liu Xichen, Standing Committee member Wen Zhenwei, consultant Chen Jinhai, Wu Shiqin, etc., successively made speeches, and explained the significance of adding consultants to the association. Because the association affairs are becoming more and more complicated and the responsibilities are becoming heavier, consultants are added to assist in the progress of the association affairs.

Tolerant Acceptance of Damaged Banknotes

Finally, members expressed their opinions one after another. The result was summarized, and it was resolved that damaged banknotes should be mutually used as much as possible in the future and should not be overly picky. The members who attended the meeting should also inform the staff on the counter to accept and exchange them at their discretion. The business policy of this industry has always been stable and cautious, and it should be even more so this year. Advertising for business should not be too excessive, which would demean the reputation of the industry.

Fourteen Fewer Listed Members

Finally, the director of the association, Wang Ming, reported that the total number of members last year was 116, and the number of members listed this year was 102, a decrease of 14. He then reported the association's revenue and expenditure accounts briefly, and then dinner began. During the dinner, there was a lot of toasting, which was very lively for a while.

### Shanghai Municipal Council Directors Give Farewell Banquet to Phillips; Silver Cigar Box Presented at the Banquet; Colleagues Express Regret at His Departure

### Shanghai and Nanyang Trade May Recover; Monthly Exports Before the Pacific War Were About 50 Million; If Trade Recovers, Shanghai's Industry Will Gain New Vitality

The famous economist Mr. An Hanning published an article in the English "Great America Evening News" yesterday, saying that this city and Nanyang, which is within the Japanese sphere of influence, may soon restore trade relations. This possibility is of great concern to the industrial circles of this city, because in the past two years, various countries in Nanyang have been major customers of industrial products in this city.

Trend of Shanghai-Hong Kong-Nanyang Trade

Among them, Hong Kong is the largest customer. Last year, the goods shipped from this city to Hong Kong were worth more than 400 million yuan, accounting for about 12% of Shanghai's total exports. However, Hong Kong is a transshipment center, so most of the goods shipped from this city are transshipped elsewhere, either to Southeast Asia or to Europe and the United States. Therefore, the export trade from Shanghai to Hong Kong can only be regarded as a small part of Nanyang trade. According to statistics on Shanghai trade, in the months before the Pacific War, the average monthly value of goods exported to Hong Kong, Malaya, the Philippines, the Dutch East Indies, and Vietnam was about 50 million yuan, accounting for about 12% of the city's exports.

Cotton Goods Ban May Be Lifted

The goods shipped from this city to Nanyang were originally dominated by machinery, but after the ban on the export of cotton goods, they were completely suspended. Before the ban, the export of cotton yarn and cotton fabrics accounted for about 70% of Shanghai's exports to Vietnam and the Dutch East Indies, 60% to the Philippines and Malaya, and more than 50% to Thailand and Hong Kong. This is because after the outbreak of the European War, various places in Nanyang could not obtain supplies from Western Europe and turned to Shanghai for supplies. Once Nanyang trade recovers, that area will still be an important market for the cotton textile industry in this city, and the ban on the export of cotton goods may be lifted.

Shanghai Industry Gains New Vitality

Other industries in this city have also developed important markets in Nanyang in the past few years. The goods shipped from this city to the Netherlands include a large number of glass and glassware, enamel ironware, and pharmaceuticals. The goods exported to Thailand are mainly cotton fabrics, herbs, light bulbs, and glass. Singapore needs glass, chemicals, ironware, etc., while the Philippines is a major customer of electrical appliances, enamelware, ironware, etc. There are also various foods sold to various places in Nanyang. From this point of view, the recovery of Nanyang trade, even if the scope is limited, may give new vitality to Shanghai's industry, and the economic situation in this city can also be improved as a result.

### Bicycle Joint License; Date of Signature and Implementation Undetermined; Joint New Licenses to Be Issued Separately

According to authoritative sources, the agreement on the issuance of joint bicycle licenses was signed a few days ago, but the date of implementation of the agreement has not yet been determined. It is rumored that one of the signatories of the agreement was Mr. Phillips, the Director-General representing the Shanghai Municipal Council, but the authorities have not officially confirmed this. It is also learned that according to the agreement, each bicycle owner must obtain his joint license from the competent authority. For example, bicycle owners living in the International Settlement should obtain it from the Shanghai Municipal Council Police Department, and those living in the French Concession should obtain it from the French Police Department. As for the license fee, each region will collect it separately. The bicycle license fee paid by residents of the International Settlement will be used by the Shanghai Municipal Council. If the bicycle owner has already obtained three licenses from various regions, he can exchange them for one joint license.

After the Shanghai Municipal Council Tram Company added a stop at the intersection of Nanjing Road and Sichuan Road, a reporter from the Datong News Agency learned yesterday that the stop at the intersection of Hart Road and Yu Yuan Road has been removed because the distance between the two sides and the Hart Road and Jing'an Temple Road stations is too close, and there is no need to stop there. Tramcars on Route 1 and Route 2 are not allowed to stop at that station.

### Wen Lantin, Initiator of Five Religions Bookstore, Speaks

The Five Religions Bookstore held an initiators' meeting a few days ago. Mr. Huang Jingwan proposed that this year is the year of the Five Religions, which was well received by all parties. It is now learned that Mr. Wen Lantin, the initiator of the bookstore, made a speech on this year of the Five Religions, saying that the five major religions of Confucianism, Buddhism, Taoism, Christianity and Islam each have a long history and great achievements, but their purpose of guiding people to do good is the same. However, calling it the Five Religions is not to create another religion, but to promote the essence of each religion and make people return to the ultimate good. He hopes that people from all walks of life will help the Five Religions Bookstore, which is being prepared this year of the Five Religions.

Wang became anxious and punched Zhang in the face, causing blood to flow all over his face. Wang escaped to the road and was finally arrested by neighbors.

### Determined to Quit Smoking

— Chief Editor

I am a lover of cigarettes and have a very strong addiction. The amount of cigarettes I smoke every day is about no less than fifty. In the past, I smoked White Tin Bags and Three Gun Towers (about one yuan per tin at that time). Now I have to downgrade again and again and smoke some of the most common cigarettes, but the amount still cannot be reduced. In the past few days, cigarettes have skyrocketed. A box of fifty Great Front Doors costs eleven yuan. It is really difficult to continue. Although I have been determined to quit smoking several times, I relapse after quitting and it is ultimately ineffective. I think there is no statistics on the number of smokers in Shanghai, but I think there must be a lot. There must be many people who share the same suffering as me. I wonder if there is a most appropriate way to quit this smoking habit forever.

### Nanyang Special Edition

Chief Editor, your newspaper has a spirit of serving society by serving people rather than serving people, which is deeply admired. Recently, when reading the newspaper, I always feel that I know little about the Nanyang terrain. I don't know if there have been any newly published maps or more detailed special editions recently.

### Confucius Does Not Limit Confucianism

— Yang Zhongyi

The 34th lecture of the "Melting Five Classics Society" and the 4th lecture of the "National Studies Forum" featured Mr. Shen Jueling lecturing on the first section of the ancient version of "The Great Learning." His summary stated that the "four things to be aimed at" in "The Great Learning" reveal the location of the Dao (Way), which does not require seeking elsewhere. "Loving the people"—Zhu Xi's version renders this as "renewing the people," since the second section contains phrases such as "If you can one day renovate yourself, do so from day to day. Yea, let there be daily renovation," so "renewing the people" is also understandable. However, considering the phrases "A gentleman values the virtuous and loves his kin; common people rejoice in their pleasures and seek their own profit," "loving the people" is better, because without first loving the people, there can be no "renewing" of the people. "Stopping at the ultimate good" and "knowing where to stop and then having direction" are consistent with the principles of "stopping and observing" and "stillness and tranquility" in Buddhism. Knowing what comes first and what comes after is "drawing near to the Dao," which opens the meaning of the following two sections. Regarding the theory of "investigating things," since Zheng Kangcheng, there have been over seventy schools of thought, none of which fall outside of the "mind-only" and "matter-only" schools. In reality, this is what we now call science. Every subject within physics, chemistry, biology (including zoology and botany), and mineralogy can fulfill the meaning of "investigating things." Our country placed little emphasis on the word "at" in "investigating things at," lacking preliminary work, which led to cultural backwardness. Western countries focused heavily on this, achieving rapid advancements, but neglected the concept of "governing and pacifying," thus developing instruments of death and causing two world wars. It can be seen that placing exclusive emphasis on either "mind-only" or "matter-only" both have drawbacks. The words of Confucius are perfectly integrated. The six sections of "The Great Learning" all end with phrases such as "This is what is meant by knowing the root," and "This is what is meant by perfecting knowledge," which are rooted in the phrase "cultivating oneself as the root." The theory that "four missing characters were secretly transmitted" and thus "this is what is meant by investigating things" was easily changed to "this is what is meant by knowing the root," making it a laughable error to tamper with the ancient text.

Mr. Yang Zhongyi spoke on "Confucius Does Not Limit Confucianism." First, Confucianism (the meaning of Confucianism): "Ru" [儒], in the "Shuowen" [《說文》, an ancient Chinese dictionary], means "soft," a title for "practitioners." "Softness" means a gentleman is difficult to advance but easy to retreat, and Lao Tzu knows "strength" and guards "weakness"—only the utmost softness in the world can control the utmost strength in the world. "Practitioner" refers to Confucian conduct: "managing the Dao and sharing the same arts." Yanzi: "The arts have order and reason." Emperor Xuan of Han: "Cultivate literature and canonical arts." Xiangru Zhuan Yan Note: "All who have Dao arts are called Ru." Zheng Xuan's note on the Zhou Li Taizai: "Ru use the Dao to gain the people." "Ru? The Houbo clan has six arts to teach the people." The note on the Dasitu says, "Teachers and Ru in the villages teach the Dao and arts." The note on the table of contents of the Book of Rites says: "Because it records the conduct of those with morality." According to the Analects, "A gentleman learns to attain his Dao," so in ancient times, the Dao arts were the learning of scholars and gentlemen, and those who devoted themselves to the Dao arts and attained their entirety were gentlemen. Fayan: "Calling those who understand Heaven, Earth, and Man Ru." This is correct.

The divisions of Confucianism: When the Analects speaks of Confucianism, only Yongye records the distinction between "gentlemanly Ru and petty Ru," and Confucius never admitted to being a Ru. Mencius speaks of Ru, only in Jinxin: "The Mohists will definitely return to Yang, and the Yangists will definitely return to Ru." There are three divisions. Although the Ru are followers of sages, Mencius never admitted to being a Ru either. What is described as "sage" is impartial, capable, and harmonious, none of which are limited to Confucianism, let alone Confucius, who is the embodiment of sagehood. By the time of Xunzi's "Exhortation to Learning," there were distinctions between "vulgar people, vulgar Ru, refined Ru, and great Ru," and also "great Ru, small Ru, and the masses," beginning to consider oneself as a Ru. He considered the Duke of Zhou, Confucius, and Zigong as great Ru, and despised the vulgar Ru, who were no different from the Mohists. The non-twelve chapter is divided into six schools, with Confucius and Zigong overseeing them, not aligning with the six schools. His disciple Han Fei then said, "The prominent schools in the world are Confucianism and Mohism. Confucius is the origin of Confucianism, and Mo Di is the origin of Mohism," "Eight Ru and three Mohists, dividing the world into halves." ("Confucius Does Not Necessarily Have to Be Ru"). Shizi Guangze chapter narrates the honor of the six disciples, including "Confucius values impartiality," and cites the text of Erya Shiggu saying "more than a dozen names are in fact one." Lu Lan Bu Er chapter narrates the honor of the ten disciples, including "Confucius values benevolence," and says, "Being able to harmonize all differences, as if they came from one, only a sage can do that." None of them say that Confucius values Confucianism. (Confucius Is Not Limited to the Confucian School) Zhuangzi Xu Wugui: "Confucianism, Mohism, Yangism, and Bingism, along with Huiism, make five." The Tianxia chapter divides into six schools, and Confucianism is not included. It traces the origins of each school to a consistent Dao, saying, "Sages are born from something, kings are made from something, all originate from one." "The ancients were comprehensive, matching the gods, pure with Heaven and Earth, nurturing all things, harmonizing the world, benefiting the people, understanding all, great and small, fine and coarse, their operation was everywhere." "As for the poetry, books, rites, and music, the scholars of Zou and Lu, the gentlemen and elders, mostly understand them." "Their methods are scattered throughout the world and established in China, the hundred schools of thought sometimes praise and speak of them." Who is this? Is it not the Confucius of inner sagehood and outer kingship, the first of his kind? It also says, "The world is in great chaos, the worthy and sages are unclear," "Scholars of one song cannot communicate," "Therefore, the Dao of inner sagehood and outer kingship is dark and unclear, depressed and not expressed. People in the world each do what they desire to make their own way. Later scholars are unfortunate not to see the purity of Heaven and Earth, the great body of the ancients, and the Dao arts will be torn apart for the world." The Dao arts of Confucius were torn apart, and then there were the methods of the hundred schools. Zhuangzi knew that Confucius was not limited by Confucianism.

Confucian scholars: Huainan Yaolue divides into eight schools, saying, "The Dao is everywhere, but only sages can grasp the root and know the end." "Confucius cultivated the Dao of Cheng and Kang, and narrated the teachings of the Duke of Zhou, to teach the seventy disciples, from which the Ru scholars emerged." Began to be named Ru scholars. Shi Tan Lun Liujia Yaozhi, Dao, Fa, Ming, are all called "Jia" (school), while Ru and Mo are called "Zhe" (scholars), saying, "Ru scholars are broad but lack essentials, work hard but achieve little, and it is difficult to follow them completely." This is not the Confucius praised by the Shijia, "with lofty conduct and integrity, mediating to reach sagehood."

Confucian school: Han Shu Yiwen Zhi narrates the nine streams, beginning with "Confucian School," and says, "Ancestors Yao and Shun, models Wen and Wu, the master Zhongni." It can be seen that Confucius inherited from Yao, Shun, Wen, and Wu, and was not limited to Confucianism. Sui Shu Jingji Zhi narrates the Ru, saying, "Zhongni inherited from previous generations, corrected the six classics, and three thousand disciples all received his teachings. As for the Warring States period, the likes of Zisi, Mencius, and Xunqing followed and revered him." It can be seen that the name Ru first appeared after the three thousand disciples, and in the Warring States period, it came from Xun Kuang's self-designation. Confucius was the one they followed and revered, but he was not limited to Confucianism, just like Yao, Shun, Wen, Wu, the Duke of Zhou, and Yi Yin and Yi Hui were not limited to Confucianism. Furthermore, it says, "Without the Dao of Yu, it is not enough to be a Moist," and Yu was not a Moist. It also says, "Without the Dao of Confucius, it is not enough to be a Ru," and Confucius was also not limited to the Confucian school. If what the Ru revered must also be Ru, then where should the carpenter who worships Lu Ban and the barber who honors Guan Gong be placed?

Confucian sayings: Zuo Zhuan Ai 21, "Only their Ru books," Shiji Tian Fen Zhuan, "devoted to promoting Confucian arts," Hejian Shijia, "The king loved Confucian learning," Shusun Tong Zhuan, "finally became the Confucian master."

Confucian conduct: The Confucian Conduct chapter of the Book of Rites records Confucius answering Duke Ai's seventeen questions about Confucianism. The Ru has such and such, but it is only a gain of one aspect. Later generations mistakenly recognized Confucius as a Confucian. Chen Hao Jishuo cites Li Shi saying, "Confucian conduct is not the words of Confucius, but the noble sentiments of the heroes of the Warring States period, mostly exaggerating themselves to deceive their rulers. How can this be what is called Confucius?"

### A Strange Record of Searching Hell

— Du Yasheng

Dear readers, this year I will tell you all about a strange encounter that I have never experienced in my life. However, do not think that I have really encountered something ghostly just because you read the title. That is something that exists in "Stage and Screen". In broad daylight, in a bright and clear world, I have not seen it. The so-called "hell" here is a small inn on the edge of the concession. I wandered in the dim corner of the accounting room (in fact, there was only one accounting table) for about twenty minutes. What I saw and heard will be deeply imprinted in my memory. That is, you, all of you gentlemen, if you have the opportunity to go there, I think no one will forget this unprecedented adventure.

I have a distant relative who was expelled from his family by newspaper announcement. The extent of his "unfilial" can be imagined. Recently, his family received a letter of repentance from him, willing to return home and start a new life. However, this kind of "vows of eternal love" is not the first time, so naturally they ignored it. His mother, however, was very concerned about her son and often secretly asked people to visit him at the address on his letter. Last week, she entrusted me with this matter.

I have heard enough about the crimes of this wanderer, but I always hope that he can suddenly see the light and become a Buddha on the spot. So I went to the address.

This kind of small inn may be the same as the kind of "feather shop" that Cao Yu visited to write "Sunrise". I found a so-called accountant and told him who I was looking for.

In the dim light of the only kerosene lamp, the accountant carefully looked at my identity, with suspicion and fear. I don't know.

Finally, he gave me a disdainful answer: "There are only A Mao and A Gou here, no Mr. ×××!"

This made it impossible for me to deal with, because I didn't know if my relative had an elegant seal of "A ×".

At this time, a figure窜out from the darkness. He was a fifteen or sixteen year old child. Judging from his walking, talking, and all his actions, his life experience may be richer than that of Mr. Ma Xiangbo. He also looked at me first before slowly asking me: "Are you looking for ×××?"

"Yes. Little brother." I felt that this child was very cute.

"He's not here anymore."

The accountant suddenly seemed to understand and said, "Little Gou, is it Little Ma?"

My relative's surname is Ma. Calling him Little Ma is naturally more convenient and straightforward than "Ma ××".

"Yes, Little Ma." After discovering a glimmer of light, I could not let go of the opportunity and forced the child to ask, "Can you tell me where he went?"

"He went to the South City. It's been a month already!" After speaking, he touched the accountant with his hand and said, "Check the account book, when did Little Ma leave?"

"Humph!" The accountant was a little angry. "I'm unlucky if I flip through the account book except for official business!"

This seemed to irritate Little Gou, who gave me a contemptuous look. "Are you really looking for Little Ma?"

I was also a little angry, and then I became smart and asked, "Does Little Ma owe rent?"

"Owe rent?" The child laughed loudly, patted my shoulder, like an elementary school teacher on the podium. "Sir, what kind of place is this? You can't even think about sleeping in the room without money!" Saying that, he picked out half a cigarette butt from behind his ear and asked the accountant for a match.

"Do you also smoke?" I asked him.

"Do you have cigarettes?" He asked me back, "Give me one!"

I gave him a cigarette and also gave the accountant one. Unexpectedly, it was this cigarette that made the accountant happy. He thanked me again and again and automatically went to flip through a tattered account book. I took the opportunity to take a look. There were some unknown marks painted on it. After a while, he told me when Little Ma left and twisted Little Gou's ear, scolding, "Little bastard, you left with him on the same day. Where did you go together?"

"South City!"

"What did you do in the South City?" I hurriedly asked.

"Doing business!"

The accountant nodded and said, "Can't you move yourself?"

The child also nodded, seeming very sad.

Although I am not an old Shanghainese, I understand this a little, so I asked him, "Big business or small business?"

"Nothing big, just robbing pancakes."

When he said this, he seemed very uneasy. I knew he was lying, but it was also evident that the child's nature was not yet corrupted. I sternly questioned, "Don't lie, tell the truth!" I threw a pack of cigarettes in my pocket to him.

Half of it was my voice that subdued him, and half of it was that the pack of cigarettes also had an effect. He smiled at me. It was a naive smile. "He lost in robbing the cigarette paper shop, but he will come out eventually."

"Little ghost, don't write, no wonder…………" The accountant spat at him.

"I'm not coming," he defended quickly. "He robbed the banknotes and wanted to take the cigarettes."

I patted his head and asked him, "Have you studied?"

"I have studied."

"Do you want to study again?"

He did not answer, but immediately shook his head.

I gave him five yuan. "If Little Ma comes out, you can ask him to stay here. I will come to see you again."

He folded the banknote small and stuffed it into his waistband. When he reached out, he held another piece of paper and waved it at me. "Sir, it's a pawn ticket for a pair of horse-riding breeches. Do you want it?"

I wanted to laugh, but I couldn't laugh. I said, "I wear a suit." "You can redeem it and sell it again. It's only for fifty yuan."

"Why don't you sell the pawn ticket?"

"One yuan and five points, five fives two yuan and five corners. I won't sell it!"

When I stepped out of this small inn, I ran into a familiar person walking in. The child pushed my hand. "Do you recognize him? He's a comedian ×××, who used to be very popular!"

I nodded, speechless, watching him walk towards the iron gate, and then turned back to take one last look at the small inn. It was just a black mass inside.

### Crosstalk

— Zefu

Crosstalk was originally a kind of ventriloquism. Xiang means likeness. One person imitates various sounds to resemble them. This kind of simple ventriloquism was popular in the early Qing Dynasty. Only one person would sit behind the curtain and do it. However, what is now called crosstalk in the North is no longer so simple. In addition to imitations of sound, there are also three elements: speaking, singing, and teasing. Speaking is telling jokes, singing is singing ditties, and teasing is two people teasing people with humorous tones. Among the three, teasing is the most important, speaking is second, and singing is the least. When performing, one person is called single crosstalk, two people are called dialogue crosstalk, and there are also three to four or five people. Usually, two people are the most common, one positive and one negative, asking and answering each other. The questions and answers are casually drawn, with no story to tell at all. For example, "tongue twisters" are used to entangle words with the same sounds, and "paired couplets" are one to give the first line and one to answer the second line, all for the purpose of pleasing the audience. It is actually no different from the comedy that is popular in Shanghai today. This kind of crosstalk is said to have been created by the Manchu Alar'er and Zhu Wenwen (also known as Poor Fear) and others in the late Qing Dynasty. In fact, the so-called military drama in the Tang Dynasty already had this scale, but at that time it still had a satirical meaning, unlike today's mostly humorous nonsense.

### Sailing in the Same Boat

— He Jiazhai

(I) The Evening of Wind and Rain

Weicheng smiled and said, "It must be done this way. I know that when I go to Chen's house, the old grandmother will still give me lucky money. However, Guoqi, you said you don't approve of feudal thoughts, so why are you inviting me to watch the welcoming god festival?" Guoqi touched his neck and put his legs up in the quilt; the biscuits on the quilt all rolled over to Weicheng's side. He smiled and said, "The festival is a kind of superstitious act of the villagers. We can see why they have this act when we watch it; so we can make an on-site observation of social reform; we can't just say that we are echoing it. As for playing cards, you should say that I am corrupted. This is just a matter of interest, it doesn't matter. Otherwise, Guofang's buying candy and biscuits should be included in waste."

Guofang was busy opening a lacquered box, distributing candy to the two of them, while remembering the lucky money Weicheng said, and smiled: "Mr. Ye said that my grandmother will also give lucky money, this harm is still the same for everyone." Guoqi also smiled and said, "When you see your aunt, don't think of your own mother." Weicheng said: "That's right, just now, when Guofang mentioned your late sister, her eyes turned red and she seemed very sad. It can be seen that mothers and children are completely natural. Even if a long time has passed, this shadow cannot be erased. Just like me, my mother is looking forward to my return home, but what about my late father? Every time I go back, I always stand in front of my late father's portrait and bow. I have an unspeakable sadness in my heart. My mother always pointed and said: Weicheng, your eyebrows look like your father. This is ultimately plain and can't be any plainer, but when I hear it in my ears, it's as if someone is holding a small knife and stabbing my heart. My nose is sore, and I can't stop the tears from flowing. Thinking that everyone has a father, only I have none. This is by no means comparable to my usual friends."

Weicheng said that Guoqi and his sister were a little sad again. Guoqi said: "Let's lie down for a while now. It sounds like the wind and rain are getting smaller. The boat has probably returned to port. Lying down for a while is like a child sleeping in a cradle. Maybe we will fall asleep. Tomorrow, we should have better spirits. Weicheng worked hard on the train, and he didn't have rain gear, so walking was especially difficult. Let's sleep. Anyway, we are going to have a good talk in the New Year." After Guoqi said that, he lay down first as if demonstrating. Weicheng drilled down to avoid suspicion. Only Guofang picked up a piece of candy and chewed it in her mouth, with her eyes closed. As for the half-leaning and half-sitting posture, it was still not changed. (10)
