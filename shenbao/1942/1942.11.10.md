### French Government Officially Announces Severance of Diplomatic Relations with the United States; Swiss to Manage British and American Interests

Vichy, November 8th, Havas News Agency Dispatch: The French Cabinet convened an emergency meeting at 1:30 PM today, followed by a State Council meeting at 6:15 PM at the residence of the Head of State, the Parc Hotel, presided over by Head of State Pétain (see photo).

Vichy, November 8th, Havas News Agency Dispatch: Following the Cabinet meeting, it was officially announced that diplomatic relations between France and the United States have been severed. The official communiqué stated that the United States, by challenging French North Africa, has clearly broken relations with France. Simultaneously, according to news from Paris, the authorities are still studying the issue of how to adopt various military measures. Government Chief Laval has instructed the authorities in North Africa and West Africa to prevent American consulates in those areas from assisting the invaders. This news was announced to the press by Commissioner-General for Franco-German Relations Brinon.

Vichy, November 9th, Domei News Agency Dispatch: After France severed diplomatic relations with the United States, the following official announcement was issued here last night: Before the armistice, Head of State Pétain repeatedly expressed to the United States his willingness to maintain the most friendly relations. And since the armistice, Pétain has never broken his word. His guarantees to the United States have also remained in effect. Therefore, the United States cannot use the pretext of preventing the Axis powers to suddenly attack French territories. Now that the three provinces of French North Africa have been attacked by Britain and the United States, this is part of French territory and is therefore no different from attacking the French mainland.

Vichy, November 9th, Domei News Agency Dispatch: The authorities here yesterday afternoon demanded that the American Embassy in France remove the American flag. It has also been learned that the French authorities in Algeria and Morocco have ordered the closure of all American consulates and detained American consular officials.

Vichy, November 8th, Havas News Agency Dispatch: Government Chief Laval met with American Chargé d'Affaires Tuck today and told him that the outbreak of hostilities in North Africa is equivalent to the United States breaking relations with France. The French government has noted this. From now on, Swiss will manage American interests in France. As for British interests, which were previously managed by the United States, they will also be transferred to Swiss for care.

Vichy, November 9th, Havas News Agency Dispatch: Head of State Pétain met with Government Chief Laval at 8:00 AM this morning, and also received Army Minister General Bridoux, Navy Minister Admiral Auphan, Deputy Chief of the Government Chief's Office Rear Admiral Béal, and Secretary-General of the Foreign Ministry Rochat.

Lisbon, November 9th, Domei News Agency Dispatch: According to news from Washington, U.S. Secretary of State Hull declared yesterday afternoon that the United States does not care whether Vichy will sever diplomatic relations with the United States.

### Laval's Message to the Nation

Vichy, November 8th, Havas News Agency Dispatch: The French people learned of the British and American attack on North Africa from the morning radio broadcast. After receiving battle reports from Algiers and Rabat at night, Chief Laval, in addition to immediately reporting to Head of State Pétain, immediately drafted a "Message to the Nation," which was broadcast to the country by radio at 8:30 AM this morning. The reaction of the majority of the people was the same as that of the Head of State, believing that the actions of Britain and the United States were completely unjustified, and therefore they were all extremely indignant. What is particularly hateful is that the British and American offensive was launched only twenty-four hours after the announcement of the ceasefire on Madagascar Island. Recalling when British forces attacked Syria two years ago, the defending forces resisted for six weeks. This time, when Madagascar Island was invaded, the defending forces also resisted for fifty-six days. The defending forces in both places knew that there was no chance of victory, but they still resisted the strong enemy at all costs. Their loyal and courageous spirit is enough to shine through the ages. Although French territory has been lost, its power will still rely on this spirit to be preserved. And what France has done has fully demonstrated its heavenly determination to abide by all the terms of the armistice agreement. This attitude can be seen by all.

### French Algiers District Two Armies Sign Ceasefire Agreement Police Power Will Soon Be Returned Other Districts of the French Army Unaffected

Lisbon, Domei News Agency Dispatch, November 9th: Since the outbreak of war in North Africa on Sunday morning, the war zone between the French and American forces in Algeria and Morocco is expanding. The American landing sites are on the north and south sides of Casablanca in Morocco, on both sides of Oran, and on the east and west sides of Algiers. For strategic reasons, the French army has withdrawn from the air force base in Rabat, Morocco. Part of the capital of Algeria, Algiers, has been occupied. The American army is now only one mile away from the Governor's Palace. The surrounded troops there have been permitted by Admiral Darlan, Commander-in-Chief of the Sea, Land, and Air Forces, to cease fire with the American army. However, other troops stationed in Algeria are not affected.

Algiers, Havas News Agency Dispatch, November 9th: The American commander and General Koeltz, the commander of the French 19th Army Corps, signed a ceasefire agreement here this morning at 10:00 AM, its scope being limited to the Algiers district. Earlier, British and American naval forces entered this port in the morning. At 10:00 AM sharp, a transport ship and a destroyer, each flying the British flag, approached the dock. A small number of British air force units and American infantry troops then landed. Several destroyers patrolled within the port, and many larger ships could be seen in the distance on the horizon. Airplanes soared in the sky above the warships.

According to this agreement, the Algiers garrison will be concentrated and allowed to return to their barracks without being disarmed. Since 10:00 PM, the order of the streets of this city has been maintained by the American army. However, this step is not of a permanent nature, and the police power will soon be returned to the French civil administration authorities. The authorities will continue to serve, and this agreement only applies to Algiers.

### Morocco

American troops landed in French North Africa, except for Algiers, which has declared a ceasefire, but Morocco is still in contact. Everything in Morocco is modern, a cultural exchange place of French, Spanish, Arab and Jewish people. "Top picture" Since the French conquered Morocco, the natives there jumped from primitive life into the era of cars and airplanes. If the locals are occasionally injured, they can be transported by plane to hospitals in big cities for treatment. The picture shows the French plane exercises in the Aslo area. "Bottom picture", the picture shows the architecture of Fez, which was produced in 143 years before the discovery of America. The marble paved ground shows the superior art of Islam. What is carved on the wall is a verse from the Koran.

Vichy, Havas News Agency Dispatch, November 8th: The authorities announced tonight that the French army in North Africa is quite successful in resisting the invading forces along the coast of Morocco. The American naval fleet appeared near the port of Casablanca at noon and initiated hostilities in the afternoon. After several teams of American troops landed in several locations along the Moroccan coast, they were blocked by the French army and failed to penetrate inland. Fresh French troops have been sent to Morocco to reinforce the area. According to semi-official sources here, the British and American attack on Algeria is merely a feint, and the actual focus is on Morocco.

French Morocco, Rabat, Havas News Agency Dispatch, November 8th: General Nogues, the French Resident-General in French Morocco, issued a communiqué this afternoon stating, "At dawn today, British and American troops attacked certain points on the Atlantic coast of Morocco, and a small number of troops landed in the ports of Fedala and Lyauday.

### Hitler Speaks in Munich Beer Hall to Commemorate the Nazi Party Uprising

Munich, Domei News Agency Dispatch, November 9th: German Head of State Hitler delivered a speech in the Munich beer hall at 6:00 PM last night to commemorate the Nazi Party uprising on November 9, 1923. First, Regional Governor Giesler delivered a speech, wishing the Head of State full of spirit and lasting health. When Hitler began his speech, he strongly stated that he has continued to abide by his plan for twenty years. What he and his comrades fought for was ostensibly domestic power, but in reality it was the struggle for the survival of Germany, and also the struggle for the survival of the entire Europe. Currently, it is the same as when the Nazi Party began to struggle. He is confident that he will achieve the final victory. The Nazi Party has repeatedly overcome crises, and in the

current war, it has repeatedly overcome dangerous situations. He mentioned the Battle of Narvik in Norway. Hitler continued, saying that Germany's war record for the past three years is an unprecedented record in history. The reason why Germany must fight in various places is to defend the motherland, keep the war away from the motherland, and prevent the motherland from suffering the war disasters that a few German cities have recently suffered. The driving force for the war against Germany is the activities of the Jews. Germany was defeated in the First World War because the masses lacked political education. Currently, the enemy is trying to repeat history, and has already made a big mistake. During the First World War, the German people were unorganized, but the current situation is different. After the First World War, Britain tried to turn Germany into a second India, resulting in Germany having 7,000,000 unemployed workers, 7,000,000 workers working half-days, and hundreds of thousands of farmers leaving their homes, with industry and commerce in a standstill, and social happiness

of course non-existent. If Roosevelt wants to save Europe in the American way, it is better to save his own country and avoid getting involved in the vortex of war. During the First World War, Germany was nominally an empire, but it was actually corrupt. Germany lacked the ability to resist the enemy. Currently, Hitler leads Germany, and he does not know the word surrender. Hitler, amidst applause and cheers, continued to declare that he often comes to the final conclusion, that although the German people rest at 11:45, he must maintain the principle of resting at 12:05. Currently, there are more soldiers and workers on the German side than on the other side. Britain prides itself on having suffered repeated setbacks but never having been defeated, but Britain has indeed been defeated repeatedly, and Britain's allies are often sacrificed. The German nation has repeatedly encountered difficulties. Frederick the Great once used a country with a population of 3,900,000 to fight against a group with a population of 54,000,000. Currently,

German soldiers have fought outside the borders. If the enemy still believes that Germany can be defeated, it is foolish. Hitler declared that he knows the intensity of the war, which is where he differs from Churchill. Churchill once said that Hitler and Göring have recently been delivering sad speeches, but since 1939, Hitler has never been pessimistic. Before the outbreak of the European War, he felt extremely anxious in order to avoid the war. Before the outbreak of the European War, he made suggestions to Poland. If Poland accepted these suggestions, Germany would devote itself to solving social problems, constructing cities, and reforming and enriching schools, and completing the nation-building work of National Socialism. At the same time, Germany would reduce its military efforts. Once a war broke out in Poland, Soviet troops would drive straight in and reach the city of Berlin. Fortunately, Poland rejected Germany's suggestions, and this crisis was avoided. (To be continued)

### French Fleet Departs Ready for Battle

### Wei Gang Summoned Back to France to Discuss North African Situation, Rumors of Darlan and Juin's Capture

Vichy, 8th, Havas Agency Dispatch: Marshal Pétain telegraphed this morning to summon former Commissioner-General of North Africa, General Wei Gang, here to discuss the North African situation. General Wei Gang arrived here in the afternoon and immediately paid his respects to the Marshal, discussing everything with the heads of government. Laval was also present. In addition, the Governor-General of Algiers, Chatel, came here to report on his duties. Originally, Babi planned to return to his post from Marseille with haste, but the news of the Allied invasion of North Africa arrived at this time, making it impossible to proceed. Therefore, he returned here to discuss major plans with General Wei Gang.

Vichy, 9th, Havas Agency Dispatch: Marshal Pétain took a walk in the park with General Wei Gang at 1 p.m. today, and then had lunch. Vichy, 9th, Huitong Agency Urgent Dispatch: According to confirmation from the French Ministry of Information, Algiers has been surrounded from the east and west. According to the latest indirect news, the Governor-General's office has been completely surrounded by American troops. The whereabouts of the French Commander-in-Chief Darlan and the Commander-in-Chief of the French North African forces, Juin, are currently unknown. There are rumors that they have been captured, but this has not yet been confirmed.

### Africa in the Midst of Changing Circumstances: French North Africa Under Worldwide Scrutiny (1)

Blitzkrieg Landing

Green are the palm trees, red are the city walls, and white are the mosques. The eternally hot sun kisses the shiny, dark skin of the natives, and the Sahara Desert sends the clear, melodious pastoral songs of young girls in the wind. French North Africa is extremely romantic.

On this side of the strait, the Algerian coastal defense artillery towers, facing north. On the other side of the strait, the fleet gathers in the port of Gibraltar. The Atlas Mountains wear a glittering snow crown, like a benevolent Santa Claus, smiling down at the small ones at its feet. The Atlas Mountains, a god from ancient Greek mythology, carries dogs on its shoulders, infinitely beautiful and infinitely great.

Suddenly, dark clouds gather, and a mountain storm is imminent. With a thunderous sound, the fleet of Gibraltar opens fire on this peaceful area. Airplanes soar into the sky, dropping bombs. A line of submarines blocks the sea surface, and transport ships on the coast carry landing troops ashore. In that instant, the landscape changes color, ghosts cry, and gods wail. The green palm trees turn into charred ruins, the red city walls turn into mud, and the white mosques fall into blood. The songs of the carefree girls turn into desperate cries, and the sky over the Atlas Mountains collapses. Extreme darkness, chaos, terror, trembling, press on the hearts of all people. It is unfortunate that the battlefield will shift from the Eastern Front to Africa, as predicted by this newspaper, but it is even more unfortunate that this North African territory, acquired by war, has become a target of the Anglo-Americans' so-called "opening of a second front"!

From the perspective of Hollywood cartoon master Walt Disney, French North Africa, with its three territories, may be just a little pig. The plump Algeria is in the middle, forming a pig's head. Morocco is to the west, a left ear, and Tunisia is to the east, a right ear. Although the left ear is larger than the right ear, its imperfection is that the tip of the ear has been bitten off by a Spanish wolf, and the wound has not yet healed, constantly oozing pus. Touching one ear affects the entire head. The little pig symbolizes the richness of this land, and also foreshadows its fate as meat on the chopping block.

In terms of area, it is more than twice the size of mainland France; in terms of position, it controls the North African coast of the Mediterranean; in terms of products, it exports more than it imports annually; in terms of strength, it still had 200,000 troops stationed there until the day France was defeated. Before the armistice, the French government once considered moving the capital here to continue the war, and this was the reason. France sent North African Commissioner Wei Gang to carry out containment work here, also for this reason. North Africa, the last lifeline of the French colony, exists if it exists, and dies if it does not.

But in order to ensure the absolute security of the Mediterranean sea lanes, the Anglo-Americans have begun to land in North Africa. In order to maintain French honor and independence, the Pétain government has also ordered self-defense and declared a break in relations with the United States. Marshal Pétain is not as willing to submit to the Axis powers as the Anglo-Americans imagine, granting them everything they ask for. It may be said that the French politicians are unreliable, but to say that Marshal Pétain is unreliable does not seem to be accurate. Marshal Pétain is a typical soldier of France and the world. He will not easily give away the colonial empire he has worked so hard to create. Let us take this opportunity to open up history and review how Pétain and others managed these colonies.

The Story of Managing North Africa

A. Algeria

In May 1830, a magnificent French fleet, its white sails filled with wind, sailed majestically from the port of Toulon, the capital of the country, towards Algeria, with its white mosques hidden among the green palm trees on the African coast 500 miles away. This expedition had a legitimate reason because the Governor-General of Algeria had insulted the French nation. Whether this Governor-General was a person who did not understand the times, later generations do not know at all, but according to history, his attitude towards the French was arrogant and rude. Three years ago, on one occasion, he unintentionally picked up a "fly swatter" and struck a French diplomat in the face. Although this incident was quite serious, if the Governor could admit his mistake and apologize, it might have been possible to turn a major incident into a minor one, or even into nothing at all. However, this Governor was a stubborn man and did not respond to the French protests. France had no other choice but to send troops to hold him accountable and uphold national prestige.

Apart from this delicate reason, the French military expedition had two other purposes: one was to eliminate the Algerian pirates who attacked European shipping in the Mediterranean, and the other was that King Charles X of France and his ministers wanted to show some color in military and diplomatic affairs, in order to externally restore the national prestige that had been fading since Napoleon's defeat at Waterloo, and internally maintain the declining imperial power. Although Britain came out to dissuade them, France was confident, did not look back, and calmly occupied the port of Algiers and its nearby coastal areas. Moreover, once they occupied it, they did not want to leave, and were preparing to stay for a long time.

The entire territory of Algeria is larger than mainland France and is a primitive country. It was necessary for France to extend its influence from the coastal areas to the interior, which required great effort. In the decades that followed, the French army and the natives constantly fought wars, sacrificing thousands of lives and millions of properties. The cost was greater than expected. There was an Arab chieftain named Qadir, who was brave and resourceful. She called on the native Muslims to launch a holy war, standing in opposition to the Christian invaders, rising repeatedly after defeats, causing the French army to be exhausted. It was not until 1847 that Qadir was captured and sent to France. However, the rebellion throughout the territory continued until it was quelled in 1871.

France was somewhat fortunate to have acquired this colony and felt satisfied for a time. The climate in this area is suitable and the land is fertile, making it a paradise for Europeans. The entire territory has a coastline of 800 miles, with Tunis to the east and Morocco to the west. The entire territory can be divided into four parts: (1) the Lesser Atlas and the Tell Valley, (2) the Shatt Plateau, (3) the Sahara and the Atlas Mountains, and (4) the inland foothills. The total area is 2,196,000 square kilometers. The capital is the city of Algiers. The population is more than 7.2 million, and the most densely populated areas are Algiers Province, with a population of more than 2.2 million, Oran Province, with a population of more than 1.6 million, and Constantine Province, with a population of more than 2.7 million. In addition, Colomb-Béchar, Bône, and Sidi Bel Abbès are also bustling cities.

In the fertile plains along the coast, as far as the eye can see, there are olive groves everywhere. There are also plains and valleys in the foothills, which are suitable for both farming and animal husbandry. The area produces various grains such as barley and wheat, tobacco, wine, olive oil, and livestock. Among the minerals, phosphate is the richest, and iron, zinc, lead, mercury, antimony, and copper are also not lacking. What it lacks are textiles, machinery, sugar, coal, steel, automobiles, gasoline, etc., which must be supplied by foreign countries. Most of the trade is monopolized by France, which goes without saying.

Editor's Note

The article "The Independent Nation of Liberia Founded by Eighty Black Slaves" has not yet been completed, and the situation in French North Africa has suddenly become tense. In order to allow readers to face reality and cross-reference with news, this manuscript of "French North Africa Under Worldwide Scrutiny" is published first. As for the remaining manuscripts of Liberia, they will be used as much as possible in the articles on Equatorial Africa, so that the recent posture of this black nation can continue to meet with readers. This is hereby noted, and please understand!

The purpose of the notice issued today by the Japanese Imperial Army and Navy in Shanghai is to clarify that all real estate within the Shanghai area registered with enemy consulates, and those registered in other consulates in the name of enemy nationals, will be treated as enemy property until the disposition of enemy property is lifted. All transfers or changes in their rights are prohibited. However, the purpose is not merely to prohibit the transaction of real estate owned by true non-enemy owners, but to properly protect them after canceling their registration with enemy consulates and registration in the name of enemy nationals. Therefore, true non-enemy owners should promptly submit evidentiary documents to the Real Estate Examination Department of the New Enemy Property Management Committee (Sassoon Building, corner of Huangpu Bund and Nanjing Road, ground floor, former site of Banque Belge pour l'Etranger) to apply for the lifting of enemy property disposal in accordance with this notice. The evidentiary documents mentioned above should include the lease contract and title deed if the applicant is Chinese, and the annual rent receipt and other documents sufficient to prove that the applicant is the legitimate owner, in addition to the aforementioned documents if the applicant is a third-country national. If anyone does not understand the intention of the Japanese army and does not fulfill the aforementioned application, the Japanese army will treat the real estate owned by the true non-enemy owners as pure enemy property. In addition, before the enemy property is released, anyone who rashly transfers or changes any rights will be regarded as violating the notice and will be punished by military law. It should also be noted that even if real estate is registered in the name of a non-enemy national at a non-enemy consulate, it will be treated as pure enemy property if its beneficial owner is an enemy national or if it is truly treated as enemy property. The enemy countries referred to in the notice are the following countries: (1) Countries in a state of war: (1) United States of America, (2) United Kingdom, (A) United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and its territories and colonies, (B) New Zealand, (C) Canada, (D) Commonwealth of Australia, (E) Union of South Africa, (3) Republic of Haiti, (4) Republic of Costa Rica, (5) Republic of Honduras, (6) Republic of Guatemala, (7) Republic of Nicaragua, (8) Dominican Republic, (9) Republic of Cuba, (10) Republic of Panama, (11) Netherlands, (12) Belgium, (13) Mexico, (14) Republic of El Salvador, (2) Countries that have severed diplomatic relations: (1) Egypt, (2) Greece, (3) Colombia, (4) Venezuela, (5) Peru, (6) Uruguay, (7) Brazil, (8) Bolivia, (9) Ecuador, (10) Paraguay, (11) Iran, (12) Iraq, (13) Norway, (3) Other entities deemed to be in a similar state as above: (1) Chongqing regime, (2) Tegor regime.

### Household Rice Restores Original Quantity, Bread Certificates Issued Regularly

Each Valid for Two Months, to be Collected Daily, Those Without Certificates May Exchange Bread for Flour

For the 16th period, rice shops in both concessions had their last day of selling household rice yesterday. Sales will cease on the 10th for accounting purposes. Sales of the 17th period of rations will begin on the 11th, with white rice restored to one sheng and broken rice to half a sheng. In addition, 1.5 jin of flour may be purchased with a flour certificate, with retail prices remaining the same. Because the quantity of household rice for the 17th period has been restored to its original state, the black market price of national rice has been suppressed. Starting this month, the Rice and Grain Management Committee of the Municipal Council will require factories to fill in the "factory worker position" column when applying for rice allocation, in order to show due diligence. There will be no other changes in the filling process. Hospitals and restaurants may still apply for food household rice needed by patients and diners. As for bread certificates, after being assigned to the district offices of the Rice and Grain Management Committee of the Municipal Council for distribution and allocation, it has been decided that issuance will begin on the 16th. Registration for food households for these bread certificates has already ended. It is estimated that there are more than 20,000 Chinese households, more than 20,000 foreign households, and more than 6,000 Japanese households. These bread certificates are blue for Chinese and red for foreigners. Each certificate is printed with the registration number of the bread factory. Holders of certificates can purchase bread at the designated bread retail stores with the same number on the certificate. Each certificate is printed with the dates from December 1 of this year to the end of January of next year for two months, and two liang of bread can be collected daily. As for Chinese who did not register in the previous period and want to obtain bread, they can exchange the flour they received each period for bread at bread manufacturing factories, but they must pay the wages for manufacturing the bread. Bread manufacturing stores must not refuse to manufacture and exchange bread.

### Tongren Cup Ping Pong Finals at the Metropole, Presale of Tickets Starts Today

The Tongren Cup Charity Ping Pong Tournament, which caused a sensation in Shanghai, has been won by Qinglian and Sanyi, two strong teams, for the total championship. The cup competition authorities have been busy preparing for the finals and other matters these days. It is learned that the venue problem has also been resolved.

The date is set for 2:00 p.m. on the 15th of this month (Sunday).

### Spiritual Food for the Masses

Recently, the Shanghai publishing world has suddenly shown a fervent atmosphere. New magazines and publications are constantly emerging. Although the cost of typesetting and paper is so high, the perseverance of cultural workers in their diligent efforts is truly admirable. It is said that various publications have considerable sales and can make money, which is enough to prove that spiritual food is a need of the people. The recently published giant monthly magazine "The Masses" has released a bright and attractive spectacle in the publishing world, gathering new and old writers together, combining seriousness and humor, appealing to both refined and popular tastes. It is truly worthy of causing paper in Luoyang to become expensive, and being widely praised for a time.

Contents of The Masses

After reading this "The Masses" monthly magazine, we can notice that the editors place great emphasis on the word "Masses." In a not-so-thin volume, there are indeed both highbrow and lowbrow elements. To borrow two sentences from its publication dedication, it truly sometimes "speaks on street corners" and sometimes "engages in pure conversation in ivory towers." In this way, what most people call low-level taste and being out of touch with the times depends on the individual reader's preferences, with each person having their own views, and cannot be generalized. The editor preemptively raising self-criticism is probably a kind of unnecessary worry.

Science and History & Geography

Since the target audience is the masses, the subject matter is also based on this standard. In addition to literature and art, scientific common sense and historical and geographical common sense also occupy an important position. For example, this issue is certainly worth reading, and even a few people holding a volume in their hands can savor it carefully. As for the articles discussing modern warfare weapons such as explosives, airplanes, parachutes, etc., as well as the two articles describing the island of Madagascar and the Solomon Islands, all are beneficial for the masses to read. According to the reporter's opinion, there may as well be more materials in this area, so that the young people in the professional circles will love to read it even more.

No Division in Literature and Art

In China, literature and art have always been divided into old and new, which is indeed a very strange phenomenon and a very bad phenomenon. In this "The Masses," the old and new factions can be said to have merged into one, and even in the table of contents, no trace of it can be seen. Writers such as Bao Tianxiao, Pan Yuqie, Qian Gongxia, Lu Fen, Yao Ke, Xu Zhuodai, Zhang Henshui, etc., are arranged together, and we don't feel anything jarring. We only hope that they can learn from each other and create great works.

Translation and Illustrations

Translation is still a very necessary thing for China in any aspect. Economic articles that help the world aside, even literary and artistic works, we really need translation too much. In "The Masses," it seems to pay special attention to this point compared to various magazines at the moment. Whether it is poetry, novels, dramas, long stories, or short stories, there is a translation, which is what reporters who love to read translated articles particularly like. I hope the editors will continue to work hard in this area in the future, not only maintaining the original position, but also expanding it! As for illustrations, this issue has three photographs of Rodin's sculptures, and several oil paintings by contemporary Chinese famous painters Zhang Chongren and Qian Zhujiu, all of which are immortal works. We hope that the editors can introduce more world-famous paintings in the future to broaden the knowledge of the general readership.

### Why So Enthusiastic About Public Bonds?

Yesterday's unofficial trading of public bonds suddenly saw an upsurge, with very few twists and turns. After the opening, it even rose to four yuan and was suspended from trading. This was the first signal since the rumors at the end of last month. Consistent large players even delivered the cash goods, but there was still a sense of using an egg to crush a stone, which was indeed unexpected, causing many parties to have a slight suspicion and develop a desire to speculate. It happened that the yarn and silk gang had lost their speculative territory, so it caused a great uproar. The shorts had no choice but to cover their positions to avoid the sharp edge, fueling the flames and causing this huge reaction. However, in this environment, seeing such a high price again is not a blessing for the market. Yesterday's Type C bond opened at 6.80 yuan, up 1.40 yuan from last weekend. At that time, there was a short squeeze, which briefly pulled back by a small amount, but then it went straight up, breaking through the 7, 8, and 9 yuan levels and being suspended from trading. Other types of bonds also rose by 4 yuan successively and stopped, but at that time it was close to the closing, which shows the ruthlessness of the longs. The 96 bond was only 20 cents. The transaction volume was 3,670,000 yuan, which is listed in a brief table below.

### Chinese Stocks: Some Flourish, Some Disgrace

Jinle New Shares to Debut Tomorrow

It is said that the new shares will be launched this Wednesday, with unofficial trading at 14-15 yuan.

### Factory Cloth Shows a Rebound

### Gold and Silver Both Slightly Lower, Tight Credit in Unofficial Market

Yesterday, the goldsmiths in this city, Dashin and other firms, quoted 2,600 yuan per tael for jewelry gold (about 300 yuan less for purchases), unchanged. Inter-firm trading prices continued to decline slightly. In the early morning, it was made high by 10 yuan, to 2,360 yuan. It then fell by 20 yuan in a situation of oversupply, to 2,340 yuan, with little change afterward. Compared with last weekend, it fell by 10 yuan, with a margin of 20 yuan. Transactions were light. The price of jewelry silver was still quoted at 14 yuan per tael, and the inter-firm trading price was 12.57 yuan, also softening, it is said.

The interest rate of the Money Industry Association has not changed, still quoted at 14 cents. However, credit is very tight in the unofficial market.

The inter-firm trading price of Japanese military notes once retreated to 5.55 yuan, then slightly rebounded, with the buying and selling price at 5.524 yuan, the same as last weekend. The retail price in silver shops and small money houses was 5.56 yuan for sales and 5.545 yuan and 5.55 yuan for purchases.

### Commercial Briefs

Black Dates Slightly Easier at High Prices: According to a Nanjing report, due to the recent arrival of more goods, the price has eased slightly. For example, date heads are 630-550 yuan, Gaozhuang is 550-480 yuan, and ordinary mixed dates are 430 yuan. Adding all the external expenses, it is still above the Shanghai market, and it is still difficult to approach.

Dried Longan Returns Lower: The previous price of large-piece dried longan was too high, and sales were a bit slow, and the market has seen a decline. According to inquiries, the goods recently arrived at the office were opened for trading on a trial basis yesterday, but because the market was not greedy, the return price was inevitably off the mark, resulting in no transaction.

Rice Bugs Slightly Tight: Rice bugs produced in Ningbo have been selling very actively recently, and most of the selling prices have become tight. For example, Zhoushan goods are 900 yuan per package, outer mountain goods are 650 yuan, Ningbo goods are 630 yuan, and Yantai goods are 280 yuan.

Bean Supply Scattered: The supply of beans is still difficult to see smoothly, and the market is still firm and strong. The accounts show 10 packages of Nanjing cowpeas, priced at 205 yuan, 50 packages of Tianjin red beans, priced at 230 yuan, and the arrival of corn is scarce, and the market feels a great lack of supply. Yesterday, 100 packages of Wuhu corn were opened, priced at 200 yuan.

Soybean Cake Difficult to Transport: The actual sales of soybean cake have not seen significant development, only mutual transfers between firms. Yesterday, a car of Yuanlong soybean cake was priced at 72.5 yuan, and a car of Feizi soybean cake was delivered in one week, priced at 73.75 yuan.

Cigarette Market Prices Fall Across the Board: One reason is the tightening of credit in the city, and the second reason is the guild's ban on speculation and trading by non-industry insiders, so the market trend has suddenly become flat. The accounts show Great Britain brand at 9,000 yuan, still fixed, Old Knife brand at 7,850 yuan, Pinhai brand at 7,800 yuan, Fairy brand at 6,850 yuan, and Wuhua brand at 6,800 yuan, all down by a small 100-200 yuan compared to before. Japanese cigarettes followed the downstream, with Gold Spear brand at 3,000 yuan, Golden Building at 3,250 yuan, Red Rose at 2,600 yuan, and Quanlu brand at 3,100 yuan. National cigarettes showed no significant gains or losses, with Pyramid at 6,350 yuan and Beauty brand at 5,400 yuan. Daily necessities also fell, with Guben soap priced at 380 yuan, Huang Xianmao soap at 190 yuan, Scissors soap at 350 yuan, matches and candles were stable, and medicine Bagua Dan was 23 yuan, a small decrease of 2 yuan.

Our Factory's Overcoat Woolen Cloth is Filled Up: Yesterday, the woolen cloth market was not weak, with both retail and wholesale transactions flourishing, and the market conditions for all goods were mostly rebounding and firming. However, our factory's overcoat woolen cloth is still weak. The public large old gray grab Zhuang Qing overcoat woolen cloth is still selling for 220 yuan per yard, the new model is 190 yuan, Yongxing is 180 yuan, and Shanghai Yarn Factory's Yuanzang Viero woolen cloth is 200 yuan for No. 1 and 125 yuan for No. 2, because its production is unusually full, and Shen Weaving overcoat woolen cloth from other factories is also oversupplied.

Spring and Autumn

### Eight Things to Open the Door

— Ge Liang

Location: A kitchen.

Attendees: Coal ball (representative of firewood), rice, oil, salt, sauce, vinegar, tea, and sugar.

Record: As follows

Coal ball: I am the authorized representative of firewood. What I want to report to you today is that a sugar wants to join our group. Let me introduce you, this is sugar. It wants to participate in our group. Whether this proposal can be passed or not requires your serious consideration.

Salt: No! No! It is my nemesis. I and it are irreconcilable. Coal ball: But it says "sweet and sweet," and firewood has already agreed. Salt: Anywhere (whether in soup or water), there is it without me, and there is me without it. No! It is not allowed to join!

Coal ball: Firewood and I have used fierce power to drive it away. At first, it softened and begged with sweet words, but later it was scorched and turned into a bitter taste, begging bitterly. The refusal of firewood was turned into a state of dead ashes that could not be revived. Therefore, firewood specially sent me as a representative to discuss with you.

Sauce: Don't let it join. It insists on joining. Why not show it some colors?

Vinegar: That's right! Why not let it taste some flavors?

Tea: Really! Why not give it some bitterness to eat?

Sugar: (Sneeringly) Humph! Don't you know that I have been in the limelight recently? Not only are there records about me published in the newspapers, but also, the southern goods store almost collapsed the house for my sake. Just by looking at the crowded people lined up outside the southern goods store, you can know that I am a very important person, humph! So many people are panicking for me, humph, who has my prestige!

Rice, oil, coal ball (unanimously angrily): What are you talking about? What's so strange about that! Really unreasonable! You are just a "nouveau riche." We are the ones...

Sugar: (Immediately softened, with a flattering smile on its face) Really, sorry, sorry, I didn't mean you three, I don't want to offend you three! As for you three, I admire you very much. To be honest, I "willingly" surrender.

Rice, oil, coal ball (together they smiled triumphantly) Haha! Hehe! Hoho! What are you saying, what are you saying!

Sugar: No matter how many sugar rolling formations I deploy, they will never be as numerous as the rice rolling, oil rolling, and coal ball rolling formations. Really, you three are indeed heroes. Apart from you three, there is nothing more important in the world, but now, I am also important, of course! The rest is irrelevant.

Sauce: What it said made my face red. The more I think about it, the more ashamed I feel.

Vinegar: I feel even more sour.

Tea: You are just feeling sour, but my heart is so bitter!

Salt: (Sighing alone)...

Proposal: Sugar requests to join the cooperation.

Voting result: Coal ball, rice, and oil voted in favor, totaling three votes. Salt, sauce, vinegar, and tea voted against, totaling four votes.

Resolution: Passed. (Rather than not passed)

Note: Anyone with status, whether a person or a thing, even a fart is fragrant. As for saying a word, it certainly won't be stinky. (This may belong to the "human relationship selling method", this is not "customary law", please do not misunderstand.) Therefore, although there is one more vote against, the status is low and not as noble as the status of the supporters, so according to the example of "the majority obeying the minority", the proposal is passed.

### Cold Reaches the Human World

— De Gang

Autumn is deep! The biting, chilling cold wind has begun to threaten the human world again.

Those bums who make their homes everywhere on the streets and alleys are, of course, the first to bear the brunt.

Once a year, the evil hand of death ruthlessly strikes them again. They begin to tremble with fear! At night: they huddle up, curled up in that tattered mat, struggling!

Shanghai's charity work is flourishing like bamboo shoots after a rain; the appeals and efforts of philanthropists are sung to the clouds, but the number of bums: the corpses of those who starve and freeze to death are still increasing!

Autumn is deep! The wind is bitterly cold, freezing people to the point of cracking, but the rich are indifferent.

As soon as the weather turns cold, coats, cotton-padded jackets, and fox furs appear on people's bodies at the same time, like an exhibition competition.

At this time, the rich take tonics internally and wear heavy furs externally. Not to mention the depth of autumn, even in the harsh winter, it doesn't matter!

A winter coat costs a thousand yuan, and the rich still shake their necks, complaining that it is too cheap, while the people of the salaried class can only sigh at the sight of clothing!

"The whole family is in the autumn wind, and the September clothes have not been cut," despite the cold weather; despite the wife's shouts and the children's cries, they can only harden their hearts and watch them suffer from the cold, the high prices are simply unbearable!

In the depth of autumn, some people enjoy themselves in a timely manner, some frown and shiver; some cheer for the depth of autumn, and some sob for the depth of autumn!

### Difficulty Eating

— Zhihu

I remember a gentleman who went to some restaurant to eat, and the bill that came out was so different from the money he had in his pocket that he blushed; I also saw in the newspaper that someone went to a restaurant to eat without bringing money (let alone having no money), and was beaten in the middle of the road as a result. Yesterday, I happened to walk through a deserted street and saw a small restaurant specializing in coolie business. A boss-like person stood in front of the counter, asking for money before letting his patrons "enter the hall." The amount of food was calculated based on the number of bamboo sticks. In this way, there will be no "unaffordable" pretenders, nor will there be "empty-handed" people who cheat for food. Although this method is currently only limited to small restaurants that deal with coolies, it may become widespread in general stores in the near future. Isn't the cry of "difficulty eating" getting louder and louder?

(Eleven) The Nemesis

Wei Cheng said, "Nonsense! How can it be so easy? You see everything in the world as lightly as killing an ant. No, no, if you do this, you will become a reckless man, not a knight or a warrior. Now that I think about it, I dare not discuss it with you." Huang Long put the photo on the table, grasped Wei Cheng's hand tightly, and smiled, "Brother Wei Cheng, I said that on purpose. It's not that I don't understand. I want to be careful, even more careful than Sister Cuizhen. I said that to make myself feel better, and to make you feel better. I'm not a fool, haha!" The two unconsciously raised their voices. Huang Long let out a haha, and Wei Cheng shook his hand, forbidding him to speak loudly.

Wei Cheng still put the photo away, and agreed with Huang Long to pretend that nothing had happened. They strolled to the kitchen to take a look, and then returned to their room to sleep. The next day, several female relatives came early, such as the eldest aunt and second aunt, and some people from the clan also came. Li Youxie only came around noon, ate a meal, and left. This was because the end of the year was cold, and everyone had their own household affairs to take care of before the end of the year. Seeing that the Ye family didn't have any actions, they came and left, and it didn't seem unreasonable. Wei Cheng looked at the portraits of his parents enshrined in the Shide Hall. During the ancestral sacrifice, he tremblingly took the eulogy he had prepared several days earlier in his hand, knelt down on both knees, and tears streamed down his face. He only read one sentence, and felt that his nose and throat were all blocked by tears. He wiped his eyelids, and when he opened his eyes again, he couldn't see a single word written on the yellow paper. Ye's second wife was walking into the hall and asked in surprise, "Wei Cheng, what are you doing?" After only asking this sentence, Wei Cheng had a dizzy spell, shrugged forward, and fell to the ground. This was just like the previous time Cuizhen fainted in the filial veil, alarming the male and female relatives. The eldest aunt and the second aunt rushed forward to pull Wei Cheng up. Huang Long also got the news outside and rushed in, picking up Wei Cheng with one hand. Wei Cheng cried loudly, and everyone was distraught and terrified. (225)
