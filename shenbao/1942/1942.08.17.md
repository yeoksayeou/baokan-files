Bombay, 15th, Havas Agency: Conflicts between police and demonstrators continue to occur in various parts of India today. The situation in each location is described below: In Dhaka, police opened fire on demonstrators to suppress them, resulting in five civilian deaths and four injuries. Subsequently, the garrison was reportedly dispatched to the scene to assist the police in maintaining order. Civilians threw stones at them, and telephone lines in various locations were cut. Demonstrations also occurred in the southern outskirts of Calcutta, with crowds throwing stones at the police, who had to open fire to disperse them. Local authorities have decided to suspend classes in all schools, from elementary to high school, for ten days. In Benares, citizens marched in formation, led by the flag of the Indian National Congress. Police intervened, and the citizens practiced passive resistance, immediately sitting on the ground. Unable to disperse the crowd, the police opened fire. In Wardha, police opened fire, resulting in one civilian death. In the Central Provinces, two serious incidents occurred yesterday: one involving demonstrators storming a station near Hoshangabad, and the other involving a fire at the Pachmarhi station. According to the British official gazette, the situation in Nagpur is gradually improving.

Stockholm, 16th, Haitian News Agency: According to news from London, disturbances have also occurred in the Assam region along the India-Burma border. The former governor of Assam, Bardoloi, has been arrested for attempting to endanger British security. In addition, thirty-four Indians have been detained in Dhaka. The majority of the Indian crowds were students who immediately demonstrated to protest the authorities' actions. While police attempted to disperse the crowds, another group of demonstrators broke into a British school and burned textbooks, which they considered to distort Indian history and drug Indian youth. Indian authorities have declared martial law and prohibited gatherings of five or more people in the streets. British police have killed seven Indians, injured thirty-seven, and arrested approximately fifty. Crucial machinery was also removed. Clashes between police and demonstrators also occurred in Nagpur, with machine gun fire incessant throughout the day. It is estimated that approximately twelve people were killed yesterday. The number of striking workers in Calcutta continues to increase, with fewer than half of the British factories in the city continuing to operate. British police in the city's port area and workers' residential areas frequently opened fire to disperse crowds. The situation in Bombay is similar, with many civilians killed. Disturbances have also occurred in the Madras region on the east coast of India.

Lisbon, 15th, Allied News Agency: According to news from New Delhi, the anti-British movement in India has intensified. Even in New Delhi, where the Indian Governor-General's residence is located, Indians are constantly attacking the city's railways, telephones, and other government agencies. It is reported that the Governor-General's residence has promulgated strict laws stipulating the death penalty for anyone who interferes with telecommunications and other public facilities, and imposing fines on residents near those who cause the damage. Furthermore, according to the Associated Press, the anti-British struggle in India spread to the central states on the 14th, where four major stations were destroyed. The disturbances in Madras are also gradually expanding. 11,000 Indian laborers in Calcutta have also resolutely refused to return to work. Furthermore, it is reported that Indian civilians are prepared to launch large-scale demonstrations in major cities throughout India on the 16th. The methods of suppression the British authorities will take in response are attracting considerable attention.

National Daily Forced to Cease Publication

Bombay, 15th, Havas Agency: According to British official announcements, Nehru's organ, "National Herald," has been ordered to temporarily cease publication by the authorities. In addition, two other organs of the National Congress, one being the "Ananda Bazaar Patrika" in Bombay and the other being the "Praja Bandhu" in Ahmedabad, will also cease publication. According to Avasni, chairman of the Press Censorship Committee of the Governor-General's Office, the British government has no intention of interfering with the people's right to make political demands or criticize politics, but it will crack down on the spreading of riotous events and will never condone them.

Muslim League Held Meeting Yesterday

Lisbon, 16th, Allied News Agency: According to a report from the All India Radio yesterday, the Executive Committee of the All India Muslim League met in Bombay today to discuss the current political situation, chaired by Ali Jinnah.

Bose Broadcast Encouraging Indians

Berlin, 16th, Haitian News Agency: Indian leader Bose broadcast to the nation, saying, "The mask of Britain has now been torn off, and barbaric forces have once again taken control of India. Under the tear gas, batons, and bullets, the Indian people will ask, 'Where are the four freedoms?' This cry is transmitted across the seven great oceans of the world, and there is no echo, not even a word from Washington. India also asks, 'Where is the Atlantic Charter that allows every nation to have its own government?' London replies, 'The Atlantic Charter does not apply to Indian affairs.' This is the position of British and American imperialists on the Indian problem. India is not isolated and helpless in its struggle against British and American imperialism. All countries at war with Britain today are willing to support India. Therefore, all Indians overseas should devote all their efforts to achieving India's goals, day and night, and work tirelessly to bring about the rapid collapse of the British Empire so that India can achieve freedom as soon as possible." Bose finally urged the Indian people to fight to the end and not lose their courage because of the arrest of their leaders.

### Major Changes Expected in British Colonial Policy; U.S. Senator Advocates Worldwide Promotion to Clarify Principles of the Atlantic Charter

Berlin, 15th, Havas Agency: Recently, the London Times published an article entitled "Colonial Cooperation," which stated in part, "There is no doubt that British colonial policy is about to undergo major changes, and in fact, it has already begun to change. The cooperation of the United States is a major factor that our country should consider when making decisions." At the same time, the newspaper also proposed the "Association of English-Speaking Nations," requesting the government to formulate an outline for joint action. German semi-official sources have paid close attention to this article, believing that the United States has made extensive demands on Britain regarding colonial issues. However, one thing to note is that while Britain, based on the Atlantic Charter, advocates granting "complete freedom" to the Philippines and the Malay States, it only advocates "joint development" by Britain and the United States for the various colonies it still controls, which is inconsistent.

New York, 15th, Havas Agency: New York State Senator Mead gave a speech here today, advocating the immediate launch of a large-scale publicity campaign to make the principles stipulated in the Atlantic Charter clear to the people of the world. Mead also said that after the Allied Powers achieve complete victory, they will encounter a very important problem, namely, forming an international organization based on the principles of justice, humanity, and the Atlantic Charter. It is said that Senator Mead, who is running for Governor of New York State, has received the support of President Roosevelt.

Berlin's Criticism

Berlin, 16th, Haitian News Agency: A spokesman for the German Foreign Ministry said yesterday that President Roosevelt's telegram to Churchill on the anniversary of the Atlantic Charter was very weak in its wording. He must have been fantasizing when he talked about the United Nations including twenty-eight countries. Regarding the possibility of Chongqing mediating the Indian problem, the spokesman pointed out that the leader of Chongqing is only listening to the orders of the United States because Song Ziwen has been in Washington for a long time. Therefore, Chongqing's various efforts to mediate the Indian problem are entirely initiated by the United States. The spokesman then discussed the article "Colonial Partnership" published in the London Times, discussing the importance and value of the Atlantic Charter. He said that Britain is like a small business that now wants to cooperate with a wealthy shareholder. At the same time, the countries and territories given freedom by the Atlantic Charter will be subjected to U.S. economic aggression.

### First Meeting of the Burmese Executive Government

Rangoon, 15th, Allied News Agency: Since its establishment on August 1, the Burmese Executive Government, under the leadership of Dr. Ba Maw, has been working hard on the construction of a new Burma. The Executive Government held its first meeting on the 15th. The various ministers delivered their aspirations for future governance one after another, which lasted for more than three hours before it was completed. According to Mr. Takano, the chief secretary who attended the meeting, the impression he got was that the ministers, including Dr. Ba Maw, were able to cooperate sincerely and help each other in the construction of the new Burma, and were also able to humbly accept Japan's guidance and assistance. At this meeting, the language used by Dr. Ba Maw was no longer the English used in the pre-war cabinet meetings, but pure Burmese. The ministers had detailed discussions on how to eliminate the British color remaining in Burma, and had even more meticulous discussions on how to build a new Burma in Greater East Asia in the future.

### United States Announces Amendments to Army Regulations: Chief of Staff to Become Commander-in-Chief in Wartime; Bullitt Has Long Talk with South Irish Prime Minister

London, 15th, Havas Agency: It is learned that the former U.S. Ambassador to France, Bullitt, who is also President Roosevelt's personal advisor, is now in Dublin and has had several talks with the South Irish authorities. The reason for this trip is still kept secret by officials, who refuse to announce it.

Stockholm, 16th, Haitian News Agency: According to news from London, former U.S. Ambassador to France Bullitt is now in Europe, and the mission he is carrying out is said to be related to the second front. He had a long talk with Irish Prime Minister de Valera in Limerick yesterday. Bullitt had attended Allied conferences in London and a meeting in Moscow. This is the first news from the British side about Bullitt's presence in Ireland. Bullitt had been in Ireland for some time, only stating that he and U.S. Minister to Ireland Gray visited the Irish Prime Minister.

Berlin, 15th, Havas Agency: The German News Agency recently issued a message stating that the northwest coast of Europe, from the Barents Sea in Northern Europe to the Skagerrak Strait in Denmark, has been fortified like a rock after two years of efforts. The strategic points of each army are all built with very solid fortifications by the "Todt Organization," which cannot be destroyed by aircraft and artillery. There are also airfields, which can launch attacks against the enemy at any time. There are also machine gun positions between the bunkers and mortar positions, thus forming a continuous line of fire. Elite troops are stationed throughout the front line. These troops are well-trained for their special tasks and have recently been replenished and various obstacles have been added. Any attempt to invade the European continent from the northwest will ultimately fail.

### Australian Special Envoy to Britain Returns to Sydney: Allied Forces Exposed Weaknesses in the Malayan Campaign

Lisbon, 15th, Allied News Agency: According to a dispatch from Sydney, former Australian Minister of Commerce and Special Envoy to Britain, Page, arrived here on the 15th. Page was dispatched to Britain as a special envoy by Prime Minister Curtin last winter. While staying in Britain, he often attended British wartime cabinet meetings as a representative of the Australian government.

Melbourne, 15th, Havas Agency: Sir Keith Murdoch published an article in the Herald today, the gist of which is: "When the Australian army participated in the Malayan campaign before, its performance was greatly diminished because it could not integrate with the Indian and British troops. In addition, some soldiers shrank back when facing the enemy, which caused chaos in the army. Therefore, we must do our best to maintain military discipline in the future and never underestimate the enemy again."

### Current Situation in Thailand

Bangkok, 16th, Allied News Agency: Thailand exports products such as rice, tin, and teak every year, while almost all industrial products are imported from foreign countries. After the war, the import of foreign goods was completely cut off. Whisky and foreign cigarettes, etc., are no longer available. The price of sugar has also increased fivefold compared to the past. Matchboxes, soap, sugar, and gasoline are all rationed to prevent hoarding. At the same time, efforts are being made to rebuild the economy. Prime Minister Pibulsonggram once said that everything from toothbrushes to steel should be self-sufficient. In the market of Bangkok today, many daily necessities such as soap and toothpaste are supplied by Japan. Since the beginning of the New Life Movement in Thailand, the people's lives have gradually improved. Women who do not wear hats on the street will be fined. In addition, anyone who does not wear a tie or wears shorts is prohibited from entering and exiting government offices. The Thai government believes that Thais have been indulging in pleasure for hundreds of years, and that without rectification, it will not be enough to revitalize their spirit. Today, apart from coolies and women bathing in the mud in the suburbs, those who come and go in the city all have the demeanor of gentlemen. The men and women youth corps members in uniforms are particularly energetic. The future of the new Thailand has unlimited hope.

### Japan Reduces Domestic Officials and Distributes Them to Various Parts of the South Seas

The specific measures have been completely approved by the cabinet and are scheduled to be implemented on October 1. Various procedures are now being actively prepared.

### Allied German Forces Break Through to the Outer Perimeter of Stalingrad; Tank Battles Erupt on the Don River; German Forces in the Caucasus Advance Towards the Black Sea

Havas News Agency, a location on the Ukrainian border, 16th. German and Allied forces have broken through to the outer perimeter of Stalingrad.

Allied Press, Xiongcheng [likely a transcription error, should be Stalingrad], 16th. German mechanized infantry and tanks are attacking Stalingrad from the northeast of Nikolov. After fierce fighting northeast of Kotelnikovo, German forces regrouped their infantry and added fresh troops to reinforce the southern flank of the pincer movement, hoping to capture the major city of Stalingrad on the lower Volga River. General von Kleist's troops in the Caucasus are advancing towards the Black Sea.

Allied Press, Lisbon, 16th. According to a London news broadcast, German forces operating northwest of Stalingrad, a key industrial city in the Soviet Union, are now 40 miles from the city.

Allied Press, Berlin, 15th. According to a German command announcement, German forces operating in the North Caucasus have occupied Georgievsk, a crucial point on the Vistula-Baku railway, located 20 kilometers northeast of Pyatigorsk.

Allied Press, Xiongcheng [likely a transcription error, should be Stalingrad], 16th. General von Kleist's mechanized forces are advancing in the southern Caucasus, while German forces in the north continue to strengthen their threat to Stalingrad. German tanks and motorized infantry divisions launched attacks all night on the Kletskaya front. The southern arm of the German forces encircling Stalingrad is closing in on the city. Although not confirmed by any source, a Vichy broadcast reported that German forces in this area had advanced to within 40 miles of Stalingrad. However, Moscow sources acknowledge that the situation in that area has deteriorated. German forces near Kletskaya launched 100 tanks in four consecutive assaults on Soviet lines, attempting to reach the banks of the Don River. In the morning, Soviet rifle divisions lost several important positions, but Soviet artillery rushed to their aid, temporarily reversing the situation. The German forces then launched three more attacks, capturing some territory. The German forces are using tanks in waves of 20 to 30 vehicles, launching attacks every few minutes, supported by heavy artillery fire and dive bombers. The German objective is to clear the road for motorized infantry to advance and consolidate their gains on the Don River. Soviet forces are using artillery and anti-tank guns to resist, but the relentless German attacks forced the Soviet forces to retreat. In the Caucasus, after recently capturing Georgievsk, German forces are continuing to advance towards the Grozny oil fields. Fierce fighting is now taking place in the Mineralnye Vody region.

Allied Press, Moscow, 16th. According to the Soviet Information Bureau's midnight communiqué, fighting continues to be intense in the Stalingrad and Caucasus regions. On August 15th, the Red Army engaged German forces in the areas southeast of Kletskaya, northeast of Kotelnikovo, and in the Krasnodar and Maikop regions. There were no major changes in other sectors.

Havas News Agency, Stockholm, 16th. German military circles are focusing this morning on the Stalingrad, Novorossiysk, and Grozny regions. Intense fighting is taking place in these three theaters, and the outcome will have a decisive impact on the German summer offensive launched 50 days ago. According to the latest reports, large-scale tank and infantry battles have erupted in the Stalingrad region since the German forces occupied Kalach on August 12th, reaching a critical point. The fighting near Stalingrad is arguably one of the most intense battles of the German-Soviet war, a fact acknowledged by German military circles. Both sides have deployed large numbers of tanks and infantry to the area. The Red Army is putting up a desperate resistance, determined not to give up an inch of ground, so German advances have been slow in recent days. Yesterday's Red Army communiqué mentioned "south of the city of Kletskaya" for the first time, indicating that the Red Army has continued to retreat in the Don River bend. However, the German pressure has increased, forcing the Red Army to withdraw from the town of Kettelmusky-Ingaya. German forces have advanced rapidly to the new defensive line established by the Red Army at the town of Proboya, which is less than 30 miles from Stalingrad. At the same time, another German armored division is advancing along the Kotelnikovo railway, reaching a point 30 miles from Stalingrad.

Soviet Counter-Attacks in the Central and Northern Sectors; Ace German Pilot Killed in Action

Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 16th. German aircraft have been extremely active in the past 24 hours. The ports of Anapa, Novorossiysk, and Tuapse on the Black Sea have been bombed, severely disrupting Soviet transport and supply lines. A Soviet destroyer and four coastal vessels have been sunk, and another destroyer has been damaged. German forces crossing the Kuban River have established several bridgeheads. Georgievsk has been occupied by German forces, and tanks are operating between the Kuma and Terek rivers. Fighting has also intensified in the central sector, with battles taking place in Vyazma and Volkhov. Although Soviet forces have launched large-scale attacks, they have not achieved any major victories.

Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 16th. Berlin military sources claim that the German defensive posture in the central and northern sectors of the Eastern Front is proceeding smoothly. In the area east of Vyazma, enemy forces, covered by artillery fire, launched fierce attacks on our lines, but were repulsed by our defending forces. Enemy attacks in the Rzhev area have also failed to achieve their objectives.

Havas News Agency, Bern, 15th. German air ace Lieutenant Ostermann was killed in action several days ago in a fierce aerial battle with Soviet aircraft over Lake Ilmen. He engaged five enemy aircraft single-handedly. He scored 102 aerial victories during his career.

### Reinforcements on Both Sides of the Egyptian Front; Major Battle Imminent; British Warships Gather at Gibraltar; New Convoys Being Organized

Havas News Agency, Washington, 15th. According to reports from Cairo, both sides on the Egyptian front have received reinforcements and are preparing for a decisive battle. Military sources here agree with the British view that the British forces must hold Egypt until the end of October to have any hope of victory. In general, the Axis powers have shorter supply lines in North Africa, giving them an advantage over the British forces. For the British, however, their merchant convoys coming from the Mediterranean are under serious threat from enemy air and naval forces, and they are hesitant to divert troops from the Middle East to reinforce Egypt due to the tense situation in the Caucasus.

Haitong News Agency, Madrid, 16th. According to reports from Algeciras received here this morning, a British aircraft carrier, two battleships, sixteen destroyers, and several torpedo boats entered the port of Gibraltar yesterday. There are now a total of four aircraft carriers in the port, two of which have been heavily damaged, three battleships and cruisers each, twenty-six destroyers, and several torpedo boats and submarines. It is reported that the authorities in Gibraltar are planning to organize new convoys to sail in the Mediterranean.

Haitong News Agency, Madrid, 16th. The British merchant ship that fled into the port of Valencia on Friday, though heavily damaged, departed yesterday. It is reported that the ship will sail to the port of Gibraltar.

Allied Press, Berlin, 15th. In the major naval and air battle in the western Mediterranean that began at dawn on the 11th, the Axis forces, with absolute superiority, have achieved an overwhelming victory in the past five days. According to a German High Command announcement on the night of the 15th, the naval and air battle in the western Mediterranean has ended in a major victory for the Axis forces. A large British convoy carrying military supplies has been decisively struck. Only a few damaged transport ships have reached Malta. The remaining fleet, unable to withstand the attacks, has retreated to the port of Gibraltar. In this battle, the German and Italian air and naval forces cooperated in an organized manner, demonstrating once again the difficulty of British transport in the Mediterranean.

Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 16th. An eyewitness to the Axis attack on a British convoy in the Mediterranean between August 11th and 13th told Haitong News Agency that the sinking of the British aircraft carrier "Eagle" was the prelude to the latest Allied tragedy. Axis aircraft attacked the heavily defended British convoy in waves. The enemy's defenses were very strong, with aircraft from the accompanying aircraft carrier and anti-aircraft guns on every ship fully deployed. During the fourth Axis air attack, another aircraft carrier was hit and exploded, causing a large fire. Ships and oil tankers were sunk, damaged, or set ablaze. The gasoline carried by the oil tankers floated on the sea surface, covering a radius of two kilometers. The remaining ships that were still able to move had to quickly leave the burning sea. After the air attack began, German and Italian warships immediately arrived to assist in the battle. The remaining ships of the convoy were repeatedly attacked by German and Italian bombers, so only a few ships reached Malta, but were still under attack by the Axis air force.

### Italy Uses Wooden Torpedo Boats in the Mediterranean

Haitong News Agency, Rome, 16th. Local officials announced yesterday that the Italian Navy recently used new-style wooden torpedo boats to attack a British convoy in the western Mediterranean. These torpedo boats are wooden, agile, and very fast, and are commanded by young naval officers.

### International Military and Diplomatic Developments Last Week

Havas News Agency, Vichy, 16th. There are four major international events this week: 1. the rapid development of the German offensive in the Caucasus; 2. the naval and air battle in the Solomon Islands; 3. the naval and air battle in the western Mediterranean; 4. the disturbances that have occurred throughout India following the arrest of Indian National Congress leaders. As for diplomacy, although there have been no major developments, it should not be overlooked. The details and results of the Moscow conference have been kept secret. It is difficult to say whether the three countries of Great Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union have decided on joint action plans during this conversation process. For example, whether the opening of the second battlefield has been decided is also difficult to guess. All that is known is that the newspapers of Great Britain and the United States have become less enthusiastic about this issue than before. While military experts from Great Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union were conducting negotiations in Moscow, the German army was launching an offensive in the Caucasus. Strategic points from the Garmeh desert to the lower reaches of the Volga River were under intense German attack, and the Sea of Azov and Black Sea coasts were again captured one after another. The last base of the Soviet Black Sea Fleet has also been directly threatened. The Soviet authorities are deeply concerned that their warships may be intercepted and confined by Turkey in the future. Rumors that the Soviet Union has been negotiating with the Turkish government have not been confirmed. Generally speaking, Turkey should continue to maintain a neutral position. Although Foreign Minister Memduh Şevket Esendal has been succeeded, this consistent policy is unlikely to change. In addition, the development of the German offensive in the Caucasus is enough to influence the political situation in Iran. The pro-Axis tendencies of the country's new Prime Minister, Soheili, are weaker than those of the previous Prime Minister, which is one example. In short, the war in the Caucasus will directly affect the situation in the Near East and indirectly affect the situation in India.

### Turkey Firmly Declares Neutrality; British Request Regarding Soviet Fleet Rejected

Havas News Agency, Berlin, 16th. According to reliable sources in Istanbul, the Turkish government has rejected British Ambassador Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen's request that Turkey allow the Soviet Black Sea Fleet to escape into Turkish ports. The Turkish government replied to Ambassador Knatchbull-Hugessen that "our country is determined to maintain absolute neutrality. Therefore, we are not willing to sign special agreements for the warships of belligerent countries. If any warships of belligerent countries escape into our ports, we will immediately disarm them in accordance with international law and confine all the sailors."

### US Army Plane Crashes During Training Exercise

### Iraq Controls Trade

Haitong News Agency, Istanbul, 16th. It is learned here that in view of rising prices and supply difficulties, the Iraqi government has now placed the import and export trade of important commodities in the country's markets entirely under state control. It is said that this is based on the advice of British consultants.

### Vichy Arrests Communists

Haitong News Agency, Vichy, 16th. Local officials declared that many Communists have been arrested recently in Montpellier and Toulouse. Twenty-six people were arrested in Montpellier. Those arrested in Toulouse are mostly Spanish and Polish radicals.

### Explosion on Chilean Destroyer

Havas News Agency, Santiago, Chile, 15th. A depth charge exploded on the destroyer "Hyatt" while it was conducting exercises near the port of Tocopilla, killing two sailors on the spot. The captain was also injured, and the hull of the ship was severely damaged.

She graduated from the Department of Social Sciences of the University of Sydney in 1913. She came to China in 1926 to study the conditions of factory workers. In 1933, she was hired by the Municipal Council to head the Industrial and Social Section.

British Nationals in Shanghai Evacuated First

The departure arrangements for the repatriated nationals have been completed. Civilians and officials will board the ship in batches, one after the other. The Japanese authorities have instructed civilians to gather at the Columbia Country Club at 2:00 PM this afternoon to have their luggage checked and receive their tickets. According to an official from the Japanese Consulate General, many British nationals in other cities who have been sent to Shanghai by the Japanese authorities will not be evacuated on the Kamakura Maru, but have been forced to wait for the next evacuation ship. The Japanese authorities originally intended to give priority to evacuating British nationals in other cities, because they did not enjoy the convenience and freedom of Shanghai British nationals. However, this plan was changed at the last minute at the request of London, which was forwarded by the Swiss Consulate. London requested that the Japanese authorities give priority to evacuating British nationals in Shanghai. Therefore, British nationals in other cities will temporarily reside at the Columbia Country Club to await the preparation of the fifth evacuation ship.

### Foreign Bank Clearing House to Implement New Measures Starting Today

The Foreign Banks Association has amended the clearing rules to adopt a fine system in order to improve the efficiency of check clearing. It will be implemented starting today (Monday). The Bank Union Preparatory Committee has joined the clearing group. All receivables and payables between member banks and foreign banks will be handled by the committee. The clearing house is located within the Yokohama Specie Bank in Shanghai. The Specie Bank will send a clearing clerk to handle general matters within the clearing house. Participants in the clearing must open current accounts at the Specie Bank. The clearing difference will be paid or received from these current accounts. Negotiable instruments are checks, drafts, and matured term deposit certificates. If a member bank wants to pay cash from a current account with the Specie Bank, the Specie Bank has the right to request the bank owing the clearing difference to directly pay the cash to the requesting bank. The Specie Bank will then issue a check for the same amount to the paying bank so that the check can be deposited into the current account to offset the clearing difference. Non-member banks may be represented in the clearing by a member bank, but the clearing house must be notified two days in advance, and the following three points must be noted: 1. The non-member bank must send its signature samples to the participating clearing banks for verification; 2. The member banks submitting instruments for clearing have the right to request the bank submitting the instruments to verify the endorsement made by the non-member bank; 3. Rejected return instruments may be handled directly between each member bank and the non-member bank. Regarding the participation of the Shanghai Banking Association Preparatory Committee, which represents the clearing banks of the association, all "Foreign Bank Instruments" received by the clearing banks of the association will be submitted by the association for clearing. Rejected instruments submitted by the clearing banks of the association should be returned through the association. The detailed procedures have been published in the 15th issue of this newspaper.

### Subsidies for Private Schools to Be Distributed Today

The Chinese Education Office of the Shanghai Municipal Council has historically allocated subsidies to private schools within the Settlement that are well-managed, and has designated them for the purpose of adding equipment and improving school buildings. It is now known that the second installment of subsidies for this year will begin to be distributed today (17th). All schools receiving subsidies can bring a formal letter of authorization from the school board and the school seal to the Chinese Education Office to sign, and then go to the general accounting office of the Municipal Council to collect the money. However, this year's autumn property tax must be paid, otherwise it will be deducted. Applications for next year's private school subsidies have already begun. Schools can obtain blank forms from the Education Office.

### Dispute Over the Sale of the Ji Ren Hospital in the French Concession

A dispute over the sale of the Ji Ren Hospital on Rue Paul Beau in the French Concession has recently occurred. One of the main parties is Shao Ruxin, a Buddhist layman known for upholding the Dharma, and the other is Master Chi Song, a frequent speaker at Buddhist lectures. Although one is a layman and the other is a monk, both are Buddhists. According to a Great China News Agency reporter, the incident began because Chi Song (resident of the Guandi Temple on Danshui Road) planned to establish a Buddhist hospital, but lacked a suitable location. The Ji Ren Hospital on Rue Paul Beau happened to be in the process of closing down, and the hospital's director, Shao Ruxin, was a devout Buddhist. Therefore, through the mediation of another layman, Yu Jingbo, the entire hospital building was transferred to Chi Song for the purpose of establishing a Buddhist hospital, priced at 25,000 yuan, with 10,000 yuan paid in advance. The remaining amount would be paid after the tenants moved out and the property was handed over. Recently, a disagreement arose between Chi Song and Shao Ruxin. According to Shao Ruxin, the sale of the hospital building was conditional on both parties cooperating. Chi Song stated that it was not cooperation, but a transfer of the building. Each party held their own position and hired lawyers to publish advertisements attacking each other. According to a Great China News Agency reporter, the original receipt signed by Shao Ruxin for the sale of the Ji Ren Hospital stated: "Receipt issuer Shao Ruxin hereby transfers the entire site, assets, medicines, etc. of the Ji Ren Chinese and Western Hospital, as per the account book, to the Buddhist Hospital. The two parties agreed on a price of 25,000 yuan in savings certificates. 10,000 yuan in deposit is received first. The remaining 15,000 yuan will be paid upon the recovery and transfer of all the buildings by the receipt issuer. A formal receipt is made as proof for future reference. Shao Ruxin's blue chop. June 27th, 31st year of the Republic of China." It is now learned that both parties are undergoing mediation, which may prevent the matter from being litigated in court.

### Landlord Sued Over Rent Currency Dispute

Kang Xingxiang, a local resident, is the owner of ten buildings at 15-17 Taiyuan Lane on Rue Brenier de Montmorand in the Public Concession. Before the war in Shanghai, he leased the buildings to Zhuo Huapu, a deceased Cantonese, to open the Yongxinglong Tea House. Later, due to the decline of business during the war, Zhuo Huapu seized the opportunity to sublet to various residents, reaching 24 households. The rooms on the first and second floors were like pigeon cages, with three tenants totaling 124 people. The rental income was quite substantial. The tea house had a contract with the owner Kang Xingxiang, which expired at the end of March this year. A new contract was renewed. At this time, the ratio of new currency to old currency was 77%. Because the rent from the landlord Kang Xingxiang was low, the new contract stated that the rent would not be divided into new and old legal tender, but would be paid in current legal tender without any discount. However, after the implementation of the new legal tender exchange rate of 2:1, Zhang Xintai, an apprentice of Zhuo Huapu of the Yongxinglong Tea House, suddenly regretted the agreement and hid a copy of the new contract. He claimed that the new contract held by Kang Xingxiang was forged and that the rent should be paid at half the value of the new legal tender. He hired a lawyer to sue Kang Xingxiang for forgery, requesting criminal punishment. Yesterday, Judge Zhao summoned the parties for questioning. Kang hired lawyer Zheng Lintong to defend him and counter-sued for false accusation. The court ordered a postponement for further verification.

### Ci Lian Relief Center Opens Two Refugee Workshops: Weaving Straw Sandals and Sewing Thread

After the closure of the various refugee camps in Shanghai, over 800 elderly, weak, disabled, and orphaned people were housed in the Ji Yuan Refugee Center on North Zhejiang Road in April this year through a collaboration between the Municipal Council and the Ci Lian Relief Association. According to the collaboration plan, the Municipal Council provided supplies, and Ci Lian was responsible for management. On the 15th of last month, the Municipal Council stopped providing supplies to the Relief Center, and the Ci Lian Association took sole responsibility for managing it. In addition to soliciting donations from various sectors of society, the association was still short of funds. Therefore, it submitted a request to the Municipal Council yesterday to continue issuing supply fees. At the same time, in order to promote refugee production, the center added (1) a straw sandal workshop and (2) a thread bag workshop, each employing over 100 selected orphans and refugees to work. In addition, a horticultural area has been opened to grow vegetables, so that all refugees in the center, except for the disabled, can have work to do.

### Two Concession Authorities to Issue Third Batch of Rice Permits Today; Those Collecting Permits Must Bring Damaged Tickets; Seventh Period of Grain Distribution Begins Today

After the two Concession Authorities implemented a per capita grain distribution system, they will issue the third batch of rice purchase permits starting today, Monday. This permit is divided into four sections, for the ninth, tenth, eleventh, and twelfth periods. Residents of the Public Concession who are taxpayers can, according to the date noted on the back of their summer housing tax receipt, bring the receipt to the permit issuing office in their residential area to collect the rice purchase permit. The French Concession has already notified the heads of each Lianbao (neighborhood mutual guarantee system) via the police station to inform all taxpayers to bring their donation receipt to the designated location on the specified day to collect the rice purchase permit. Regarding the seventh period of grain collection, all contracted rice shops are prepared and will begin sales today. Holders of the seventh section of the second batch of rice purchase permits can purchase 1.5 Sheng (approx. 1.6 quarts) of white rice per section at a price of 3.8 yuan, with an optional purchase of 1 Jin (approx. 1.3 lbs) of flour at a price of 2.3 yuan, totaling 6.1 yuan. However, the purchase of flour is optional; rice shops must not force purchases.

### Essentials of Home Air Raid and Fire Protection (4)

Yellow phosphorus can corrode the skin, so do not touch it with hands or feet. If it adheres to the skin, wipe it off with a 5% solution of sodium bicarbonate or a saturated solution of copper sulfate, and then treat it like a normal burn with tannic acid, etc. Incendiary bombs are often dropped together with explosive bombs and gas bombs. Therefore, those engaged in air defense must also have knowledge of protection against blast fragments, explosive force, or poisonous gas.

(C) Defense Against Fires Caused by Other Reasons: For fires caused by reasons other than incendiary bombs, the first requirement is early detection, direct water injection onto the source of the fire, and efforts to prevent the fire from spreading. For fires caused by oils and special chemicals that are not suitable for water injection, use appropriate fire extinguishers such as chemical foam extinguishers or carbon tetrachloride fire extinguishers to extinguish the fire, or cover the fire with sand or blankets.

(D) Defense When a Fire Has Already Occurred: After a fire occurs, directly inject water onto the burning area and work hard to extinguish the fire. If a fire occurs in a detached house (and there is no direct risk of it spreading to adjacent houses) and the home air defense team cannot extinguish it, focus on guarding against flying embers. If there is a possibility of spreading to adjacent houses, immediately work to prevent the spread. For houses connected to several others, water should be injected simultaneously from inside and outside the unburned parts, and efforts must be made to prevent the fire from spreading from the ceiling interlayer. When a fire occurs, pay attention to embers carried by the wind. (E) Essential Points of Firefighting Work: When engaged in firefighting work, be sure to wet your clothes beforehand. When injecting water, concentrate the use of all firefighting equipment such as lead buckets, portable pumps, well pumps, and tap water pipes. When using a lead bucket to inject water, hold the handle and edge of the bucket with one hand, and grasp the edge of the bottom of the bucket with the other hand, leaning forward slightly when pouring. The volume of water in the bucket should be about one-half to seven-tenths of the bucket's capacity. When multiple people are passing lead buckets of water, the distance between two people passing water should be about one and a half meters. However, the distance when returning the empty buckets can be greater. When passing water to the second floor or roof, use ropes to lower empty lead buckets. Sand and soil should be placed in bags with a capacity of about two liters. Fire bells and water ladles are used to watch for embers in high places. Long poles are used to break ceilings and floors, etc., or to move incendiary bombs.

(F) Essentials for Surveillance: After an air raid alarm is issued, each observation post should have one person on duty, rotating every thirty minutes or one hour. When a surveillance person discovers an enemy plane or hears the sound of bombs exploding, or after an enemy plane flies away, they should loudly notify the area. When an incendiary bomb is discovered, use metal instruments to make noise and loudly notify the area.

Other Protective Activities: (A) When there are injuries or deaths from bombing, those engaged in air defense should immediately notify the police station or ambulance station. (B) Make sure the flames are completely extinguished and prevent residual fires from reigniting. After extinguishing the fire, be vigilant for several more hours. (C) If an unexploded bomb is discovered, immediately set up a marker and cordon off the surrounding area with ropes to prevent pedestrians from approaching, and immediately notify the police authorities.

Actions After the Air Raid Alarm is Lifted: After the air raid alarm is lifted, each household's air defense person in charge should check the extent of the damage, implement emergency measures, and strengthen necessary preparations to prevent another air raid. (The End)

### Wife Sues for Divorce Because Husband Has Bad Habits

Fan Baoying, a 25-year-old woman from Baoshan, currently works as a teacher at Zhabei Elementary School on Nanxing Road in Zhabei. In 1936, at the age of 19, she was betrothed by her parents to Jin Difu (33 years old, currently residing at 480 Kangti Road), who was from the same hometown. During the August 13th Incident the following year, Fan fled to Shanghai for refuge, and Jin took the opportunity to invite her to stay. He then requested to live together, agreeing to hold a wedding ceremony when the situation stabilized. At that time, Fan's parents agreed to his request and ordered their daughter to live with Jin. They have now had three daughters. Fan hoped that her fiancé would strive to improve and build a happy family together. However, Jin has become degenerate, having no occupation and indulging in bad habits. Despite repeated劝劝, he refuses to quit. He uses Fan's hard-earned money to supplement the family expenses, but shows no pity for Fan. Instead, he becomes violent, beating and scolding her. Fan has endured extreme mental suffering. Because she thought she must rely on him, and there would be a long future together, her lifelong happiness has been washed away. She feels it is difficult to stay married to him. Therefore, she hired a lawyer to file a lawsuit with the court against Jin to terminate the marriage contract and end the cohabitation relationship. The court hearing was held the other day. The defendant, Jin Difu, also arrived at court with his lawyer to defend himself, saying that he and the plaintiff had already married in their hometown, which can be proven by witnesses, and requested that the lawsuit be rejected. The court approved the request and ordered the case to be returned for further investigation and handling.

### Scholarship Elementary School Group Begins Payments Today; Recipients Must Be Accompanied by Themselves or a Parent to Collect; Those Who Did Not Qualify Are Also Requested to Come and Retrieve Their Documents; Deadline for University Group Applications Extended to the 20th

The elementary and secondary school and tutoring groups of the Shenbao Readers' Scholarship, after screening exams and interviews, have all completed their review. The approved scholarship lists have been published in this newspaper since the 11th of this month. The elementary school group was published in full on the 11th, 12th, and 13th. Scholarship payments will begin today. The payment time is scheduled from 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM and from 1:00 PM to 4:30 PM daily. Those who did not qualify are also requested to come and retrieve their documents as soon as possible. Payments for the secondary school group are scheduled to begin on the 21st. Please pay attention. Applications for the university group and the free quotas for various schools are still being processed. Impoverished students should not miss this last chance.

Instructions for Collecting Payments

Scholarship checks approved for the elementary school group will be issued starting today. All approved applicants must, starting from the 17th, be accompanied by themselves or a parent to the office within one week, bringing their personal seal (i.e., the original seal affixed on the application form) to collect the check. Payments will not be issued after the deadline. All students whose names have been published on the list, if they need to change schools, please send a letter to the office immediately, stating the reasons for the required school change and requesting the change. Otherwise, once the check has been issued, no further changes can be made. After receiving the check, the school must be responsible for collecting the funds from the bank within two weeks. If the deadline is exceeded, the check will be void. If there are special reasons that require the check to be reissued and the newspaper agrees, the original check must be returned before the change can be made. If an applicant is unable to attend school for other reasons, the check must be returned as soon as possible. The original documents can be retrieved with the registration certificate.

Application Deadline Extended

The number of applicants for this year's university group has already exceeded twice the previous two times. After the application deadline, many impoverished university students continued to write letters requesting to extend the application deadline. After careful consideration by the scholarship committee members Shen Siliang, Chen Xuanren, Lu Gaoyi, and Zhao Zongyu on the 12th, it was deemed that assisting impoverished university students was more urgent than assisting elementary and secondary school students. It was decided to grant a special extension to the application deadline, from now until the 20th of this month. Applicants are allowed to continue obtaining application forms from the office and complete the application procedures. However, it must be specially noted that this application must be certified in writing by the university authorities as being of good character and academic standing and from an impoverished family to be eligible. There are few days left, so do not miss this last opportunity. As for elementary and secondary school students, requests to extend the deadline will not be granted.

### Shanghai Purge and Reconstruction Key Points

Chen Gongbo, Chairman of the Shanghai Purge and Reconstruction Committee and President of the Shanghai Public Association, and Miyazaki, Head of the Shanghai Special Affairs Agency, jointly issued statements on the Shanghai Purge and Reconstruction, which are recorded as follows:

Chen Gongbo, Chairman of the Shanghai Purge and Reconstruction Committee, issued a statement on the Shanghai Purge and Reconstruction, with four key points: The most important issue of the Purge and Reconstruction is that politics, military affairs, party affairs, social movements, and mass organizations must be unified. Only in this way can the organization of the Purge and Reconstruction be sound, and the mission of the Purge and Reconstruction can be achieved. From now on, after the Purge and Reconstruction is carried out, all political and military affairs must be subject to the supervision and command of the Purge and Reconstruction Committee. This is something that political workers and all soldiers and civilians should understand. The Chairman instructed that the Purge and Reconstruction must first purify the heart. Cadres and all personnel responsible for the Purge and Reconstruction should be honest and impartial, and work hard. Everyone must not disturb the people, and everyone must protect the people. Anyone who violates this principle will be dealt with according to military law. It is hoped that military and political personnel will understand this principle and not violate it. The Purge and Reconstruction is intended to support the people and ensure security and peace. It is hoped that the people will not only cooperate with the Purge and Reconstruction but also actively work hard to organize and develop the security, transportation, economy, education, etc. of the area. In this way, local security can be established, and political integrity can be expected. Those who deliberately disobey will also be executed according to military law. Those bandits and communists within Shanghai who are either blindly following or being coerced and disturbing the local area do not originally intend to do so. Once the Purge and Reconstruction begins, they should immediately show their sincerity and return. The government will not investigate their past actions and will arrange for their resettlement. If they stubbornly refuse to repent, the government will not tolerate them. During this Purge and Reconstruction, there will be no tolerance for those who disturb the local area. It is hoped that they will each return to farming or immediately show their sincerity and accept recruitment, and not violate the law and bring disaster upon themselves.

Miyazaki Shige Saburo, Head of the Shanghai Special Affairs Agency, issued a statement, stating that the construction of a new order in East Asia is China's important mission. Therefore, it is necessary to eliminate bad elements in China, reform politics, and stabilize people's livelihoods as a matter of urgency. Furthermore, in order to achieve this goal, it is necessary to implement the Purge and Reconstruction. If thorough purging is carried out in the military, political, economic, and cultural sectors of each district and town, the people will be able to live in peace in their hometowns, and officials and people will be able to enjoy prosperity. An ideal country can be reached in this way. The first phase of the Purge and Reconstruction in the Shanghai area will be implemented in the three areas of Nanhui, Fengxian, and Beiqiao under the jurisdiction of the Shanghai Special Municipality. Military activities will be carried out to eliminate bandits and thieves in the area. Bamboo walls will be built according to the terrain to prevent the infiltration of undesirable elements and to prevent their political infiltration. In the past, sub-district offices, etc., were established below the district offices. Now, in order to achieve great success in the Purge and Reconstruction, in addition to implementing blockade management, working teams will be organized to be responsible for various matters related to the entry and exit of the area. It is hoped that the residents will understand the purpose of the Purge and Reconstruction in detail, lead by example, and cooperate to move forward together to achieve the goal of cooperation between officials and people.

### Operating Income and Capital Income, the Two Lifelines of Insurance Companies

— Huai Xuan

—New Company Management Issues—

For any business, at the beginning of its establishment, there must first be meticulous budgets and arrangements for business operations. Otherwise, one should not engage in it rashly, especially for insurance companies. The main operating revenues of an insurance company are: Premium income from retained insurance amounts; Income from reinsurance premiums or commissions; Profits from capital utilization. Based on the above, we will formulate two plans for the insurance company's business plan. Now, assuming a company with a capital of 2.5 million yuan, the first plan is as follows:

Expenditure: Establishment fee of 100,000 yuan; recurring expenses of 30,000 yuan per month (assuming 30 employees).

Income: Net premium income of 100,000 yuan per month, of which 40,000 or 50,000 yuan is retained, and 60,000 or 50,000 yuan is ceded. 60,000 or 50,000 yuan returned.

Provisioning for reserves and expense components: Expenses account for 30% (i.e., 30,000 yuan); claims reserves account for 30% (i.e., 30,000 yuan). Reserve ratio percentage ten.

Based on the above estimates, the net income is sufficient to cover recurring needs. The capital of 2.5 million yuan, minus the establishment fee of 100,000 yuan, leaves 2.4 million yuan. This fund can be fully utilized for investment. According to the Insurance Law, the use of insurance funds and liability reserves is limited to the following: Deposits in banking institutions; Trust deposits; Loans secured by valid securities; Loans secured by life insurance policies (referring to the liability reserves of life insurance companies); Loans secured by real estate as first collateral; Investment in public bonds and corporate bonds; Investment in real estate. Therefore, the profit from the use of these funds can be used as the company's surplus.

Second Method: Assume that the company has just been established and there is no certainty in business operations. It would be impossible to rely on premium income to cover expenses. At a minimum, it must rely on the interest earned from capital utilization to cover expenses. That is, if the 1.4 million yuan in funds can earn a weekly interest rate of 1.5% or 2%, it will be sufficient to cover expenses. However, this is not the normal state of the insurance industry.

Is the insurance industry really emerging? How many can follow the first method and seek survival or development on the right track? I am afraid that nine out of ten will resort to the second method and seek to use their capital to get by.

This article was hastily written, and there may be omissions and inaccuracies. I hope readers will forgive me.

### Market Dynamics

Government Bonds

Although the bond market has turned to recovery, the foundation still feels weak. Without new stimuli, the situation is not easy to clarify.

Chinese Stocks

The market sentiment, which had been sluggish for consecutive weeks, showed a slight improvement, but it has not yet become widespread. The most colorful performer last week was the new pharmaceutical stock, with almost no exceptions. The rise and fall of new pharmaceutical stocks often has an exciting effect on the entire stock market. This opportunity may give the stock market some impetus in the future, or it may not be known. However, the interbank lending measures issued by the Silver Union Association evaluate Chinese stocks on the principle of not exceeding the face value. This has a considerable binding effect on general stock trading.

Yarn and Cloth

The situation for yarn has not improved, but people's hearts have become firmer. The prices of various grades of goods rose sharply last week, which was even more noticeable after August 13th, and deserves attention. At the end of the week, Lanfeng reached 5,300 yuan, and Shuangma Factory's single cloth also surpassed the spot price, once reaching a high price of 5,350 yuan. The fabric factory uniformly caught up. The Silver Union Association's recognition of goods for interbank lending is indeed a stimulant.

Western Medicine

The excellence of the new pharmaceutical stocks is a reflection of the improvement in the Western medicine market. The downward trend stabilized last week, and signs of a rebound began to appear. However, there is still nothing to be optimistic about in the environment.

Grains

Grain trading is extremely chaotic, with both rises and falls. It is said that the distribution method has been determined, and the distribution price is calculated in military tickets. Tianjin soybeans are priced at 33.5 yuan each, Tianjin peanuts at 45.5 yuan each, Tianjin green beans at 28.5 yuan each, mung beans at 33.5 yuan each, and red beans at 29.5 yuan each.

### Outside the Venue Gossip

According to a recent survey by a real estate company, the current market price of real estate in the city is highest in the central area of Nanjing Road at 1.2 million yuan per Mu (approx. 1/6 acre), and lowest in the West Shanghai area at about 100,000 yuan. The approximate prices are as follows:

### Nutrition and Mental Health

— Da Fen

Some time ago, the YMCA held a nutrition exhibition that attracted considerable attention from the public. However, whether nutrition is sufficient or not is not only related to physical health but also closely related to mental health, especially Vitamin B1.

We generally know that a deficiency of Vitamin B1 can easily lead to beriberi. However, few realize its close connection to the psychological aspect. A slight deficiency of Vitamin B1 in the diet can make a person irritable and very easily angered. Consistent deficiency can result in discouragement, listlessness, and feelings of inferiority, among other things.

Women with normal emotional states, given a diet containing all nutrients except Vitamin B1, can begin to show psychological symptoms after two or three weeks. The longer the period, the more pronounced the symptoms become. These include an inability to concentrate, blurred memory, helplessness, shyness, inferiority complex, irritability, depression, and anxiety. Happy, sociable people become cold, lazy, and unwilling to cooperate.

Therefore, we can believe that some patients with so-called neurasthenia are actually suffering from malnutrition, particularly a deficiency of Vitamin B1. However, if a doctor uses vitamins to treat the illness, they often encounter resistance: patients may suspiciously ask, "Can vitamins cure diseases?" However, the answer is yes. Therefore, treatment of these conditions must be consistently paired with a diet containing appropriate nutrition. If certain weak symptoms are deeply rooted, treatment becomes more difficult.

Foods containing Vitamin B1 are not plentiful, with only grains, lean pork, peas, and soybeans containing some. If our diet lacks these foods, we will suffer from Vitamin B1 deficiency. However, much of the Vitamin B1 is lost in milled white rice and processed flour. Recently, however, there is a type of "nutritional flour" in the United States that contains sufficient Vitamin B1.

In conclusion, we now have reason to believe that Vitamin B1 is closely related to mental health. Whether other vitamins are also related to mental health remains to be studied.

### Red Bean Bun

— Ye Tang

I bought a red bean bun from a Cantonese food stall to appease my hunger. Unexpectedly, after taking a bite, I discovered that the flour contained a lot of fine sand. This bun, containing both "red bean" and "sand," can truly be called a "red bean bun" in name and in fact.

Random Thoughts

### Sweet Dew

— Tian Li

In the evening, I returned from my tutoring school. The weather was so hot that my underwear was soaked and stuck to my body. Of course, my mouth was also very thirsty because I had not had a single drop of water for nearly two and a half hours. So, I hurried back to the factory to enjoy the sweet dew I needed most at that moment: cold boiled water. The road from the school back to the factory, although not very short, was still only about three or four *li*. You can imagine how anxious I was on this journey! I wished I could reach the factory in one step, but in fact, the more you wanted to hurry, the more you felt the road was long and endless.

In Shanghai, there are actually many things to quench one's thirst: soda, orange juice, ice cream, shaved ice… these are all sold along the way. Why did I insist on cold boiled water? Oh, you must know that these cold drinks are not prepared for poor people like us! So, whenever I passed a refreshment shop, I didn't even dare to turn my head. Some people say that imagining plums can quench thirst. But I, on the contrary, think that looking at refreshment shops only increases my thirst. So, I quickened my pace, hoping to get to the factory sooner.

Finally, I reached the factory gate and immediately took out the box of cold boiled water that I had prepared before going to school. I gulped down ten mouthfuls in one breath. At this moment, my mouth was moistened by the water, and my whole body suddenly felt comfortable. I knew that I must be smiling. Because I felt satisfied, victorious, and happy.

(8) What to Do

Second Mrs. Ye had also suspected that Wei Cheng might have some unspeakable difficulties, so she didn't press him for details. Instead, she asked Ah Xing many questions. Ah Xing, of course, answered his mistress's questions truthfully, knowing what he knew and admitting what he didn't. Second Mrs. Ye said, "There's nothing else to worry about, except that in such cold weather, when you go out, you must prevent chilblains on your hands and feet." She truly regarded Wei Cheng as her own child, reaching out to touch his face and saying, "Isn't that so? Wei Cheng, your face was originally smooth, but now it's not right. Do you have cold cream in your room? When you wash your face, quickly rub some soap on it first, then apply some cold cream." Cui Zhen quickly chimed in, "If Cheng *di* needs it, I have it in my room. Anyway, Cheng *di* bought it for me." Although Cui Zhen told Wei Cheng this sincerely, she regretted it halfway through, thinking that since Cheng *di* bought it for me, why did I have to tell Second Aunt, especially with Magpie, Ah Yu, and others standing in the room. She felt a little regretful, and her face naturally felt hot and uncomfortable. But Wei Cheng replied quickly, saying, "Cui Zhen *jie*, I have it in my room." Only then did he cover it up.

Wei Cheng's clothes, having traveled with Wei Cheng once, were checked one by one by Cui Zhen upon his return. Wei Cheng said he needed to rest, so she spread a piece of Western dog skin blanket on the rattan chair he usually lay on in summer and asked him to lie down. Second Mrs. Ye said, "It's better to go to bed earlier. We can talk about everything tomorrow. In the future, Wei Cheng, don't run around randomly. When you run around with your legs, I feel like my heart is running around with you." Wei Cheng agreed and went to his room to sleep. Later, when Second Mrs. Ye wanted Wei Cheng to talk to her late at night, Wei Cheng came uninvited, alone, groping his way to Second Mrs. Ye's room in the dark. He gently called out "Aunt" outside the room, and Second Mrs. Ye replied. After Wei Cheng entered the room, he called out twice more. Second Mrs. Ye opened her eyes and knew it was Wei Cheng. He was wearing a thick velvet nightgown and said, "Aunt, I will tell you the reason why I must go to see my brother and sister Guo Qi and Guo Fang, while Cui Zhen *jie* is not here." (156)

### Miss School

— Pan Shu Xian

The Misses in School

In the past, someone divided the students of three girls' schools in Hangzhou into three different classes: the students of the Provincial Girls' Middle School, with short hair and short skirts, simple and fond of sports, were the student faction; the students of another private, non-missionary girls' school, mostly older, loved to dress up but were not particularly neat, and liked to sing songs like "Peach Blossom River" with flattened throats, were called the "Jasper Faction"; and the students of the missionary girls' school, because they all wore *qipao*, sang Western songs, and were relatively quiet and generous, were called the "Miss Faction."

Not only was this the case in Hangzhou, but most missionary girls' schools in various places, with few exceptions, had the honorable title of "Miss School." And the misses who came out of these schools often aroused the interest of many leisurely classes.

In Shanghai, many socialites are students from missionary schools. They are all beautiful and generous, dressed elegantly and luxuriously, able to dance ethereal ballroom dances; able to speak fluent English; and most can play a little music. Recently, bicycles have become very popular. As long as you stand on the street and stare, among the ladies with the most beautiful bicycles, the most exquisite clothes, and the most carefully combed hair, nine out of ten are misses from missionary girls' schools.

However, it would be a big mistake to think that all the students in missionary girls' schools are like them. Indeed, because missionary girls' schools charge higher fees, the students are often from families with higher levels of education, better economic conditions, and a more Westernized education. Therefore, they may dress more neatly than some female students from non-missionary schools, but luxury is out of the question. Even in the most famous "Miss Faction" girls' middle school in Shanghai, most students still wear not-so-new cloth clothes. And when they see strangers, most of them are still shy and reserved, not like seasoned social butterflies.

In terms of academics, people often assume that students from missionary schools must be proficient in English and careless in Chinese. This is not entirely true either. Students from missionary schools, except for a very few whose English is indeed outstanding, are usually just average. In Chinese, because some missionary school authorities themselves do not have much research in Chinese, they often overcompensate in an attempt to wash away the bad reputation that "the Chinese level of missionary schools must be poor," and love to hire old gentlemen such as former Qing *gongsheng* or *xiucai* to teach Chinese. Of course, we cannot completely deny that these people are not qualified to be Chinese teachers in middle schools. There are not a few among them who have real talent and learning and are patient and encouraging. However, many *xiucai*, in addition to being able to recite the Four Books and Five Classics, do not understand what the "national essence" really is, let alone the teaching methods that can arouse students' interest in Chinese. Therefore, although students have to write classical Chinese compositions like "Man is born into the world" in the classroom, and even have to write old-style poems in seven-character or five-character lines, they often find themselves unable to write a smooth and generous ordinary vernacular letter in their daily lives. Of course, we can still cite many ladies from missionary schools who write good articles, but generally speaking, the Chinese level of missionary schools is mostly not as good as some non-missionary schools.

How did this happiness come about? It was because before going to school, I put hot boiled water in a large cup and let it cool. On the way back, I didn't dare to delay, and I walked to the factory in one breath. All of this was done by myself, and this happiness was also created by myself.

Although this is only a very small trivial matter, it gave me an inspiration. No matter what you want to do, as long as you have a plan, are not afraid of difficulties, and do not abandon your goal halfway due to the enticement of others, then if you keep working hard like this, you will definitely achieve your goal. When you achieve your goal, happiness will naturally belong to you as well.

### Truth

— Lan Ke

One day, I saw a "mountain man" on the street carrying a gourd and holding a small flag, saying he was auctioning off truth. I couldn't help but feel a little angry at the fortune-teller's words. Truth has also become a common herb.

Truth is the creation of the ultimate good, so it is an action, not an emotion, let alone a fortune-teller's language.

If you want to achieve the ultimate good, the most convenient path is to benefit the majority of people and benefit the social group. Remember, it is to benefit others, not just to benefit yourself. Benefiting yourself only adds misfortune to others and causes chaos.
