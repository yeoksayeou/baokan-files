Reuter Dispatch from Berlin, 3rd: Well-informed sources here claimed last night that the British attempt to land behind the German Al Alamein front line was thwarted by our forces last night.

Havas Dispatch from Stockholm, 3rd: According to reports from both belligerent parties, the battles on the Egyptian front have now reached their climax. The intensity is unprecedented. Semi-official sources in Berlin stated that the British offensive, originally intended to decide the Egyptian campaign in one decisive battle, has failed after six days of intense fighting. However, the German High Command has acknowledged that the fighting is intense, even more so than before. The Italian High Command's battle report this morning also indicated the same, but stated that the enemy's offensive had been contained by the Axis forces, and that the Axis forces had launched repeated counter-attacks. In addition, the intensity of the air battles is also rare. Meanwhile, the British Middle East Command stated that Allied infantry divisions made significant progress south of the coast yesterday. The intense tank battles between the two sides raged throughout the day yesterday, and the intensity has not diminished. Axis attacks on the coastal front have been repelled. The British Air Force bombed enemy positions, inflicting heavy losses. Yesterday, British aircraft lost thirteen planes, while at least five German Junkers aircraft were shot down, four other aircraft were shot down, and seven caught fire after being hit.

Reuter Dispatch from the German Führer's Headquarters, 3rd: Today's German war report stated that the Egyptian battles are intensifying. Enemy tank units that penetrated the northern sector of the Al Alamein line were unable to advance due to our forces' fierce counter-attacks. German and Italian air forces are continuously bombing British mechanized units, enemy artillery positions, and rear lines of communication. Five British aircraft were shot down in the Mediterranean, one of which was shot down by a German submarine.

Reuter Dispatch from Rome, 3rd: The Italian High Command announced this afternoon that the battles on the Egyptian front became more intense yesterday. Large formations of fresh enemy troops advanced towards the Axis positions. Our forces fought bravely and launched repeated counter-attacks, inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy, with losses of over ninety tanks. Our side also suffered heavy losses. The battles are currently raging. Our forces are deploying all types of aircraft to attack enemy troops and the enemy's rear lines. In multiple air battles, our fighter planes shot down three enemy planes, and German planes shot down twelve enemy planes. At the same time, while escorting transport ships, German and Italian aircraft repelled several attacking enemy aircraft and shot down four twin-engine enemy aircraft. Our navy also sank one enemy submarine.

Reuter Dispatch from Berlin, 3rd: Yesterday morning, British tank units launched a large-scale offensive, which was crushed after twenty-four hours of intense fighting. The British forces on the Al Alamein front have now ceased their offensive activities.

Reuter Dispatch from Stockholm, 3rd: London newspapers commented on the North African campaign, stating that the success of the Allied offensive depends on control of the sea and air. Once victorious, large numbers of warships and aircraft can be redeployed to other fronts.

### Battle Enters Second Phase, 2,000 Allied Soldiers Captured

Havas Dispatch from Berlin, 2nd: The following report on the situation on the Egyptian front has just been released here: On the sixth morning of the British offensive, the Axis positions from the Qattara Depression to the coast are still in the hands of the German-Italian allied forces. As a result of two fierce British attacks, the Axis positions were broken through in a very narrow area, but this offensive was quickly repelled. The enemy suffered heavy losses, retreated in panic, and even abandoned their original positions. When the Axis forces began their counter-offensive in Egypt, a German detachment, isolated, re-established contact with the main force. This detachment, outnumbered, fought with unprecedented bravery. The "hedgehog" position it held was extremely important, and the large British forces were thereby constrained, thwarting their attempt to break through the Axis lines. As a result of the fierce fighting yesterday, the communication lines for other isolated strongholds have also been restored. They immediately joined forces with the main force of the German-Italian "blitz unit" to attack. At the same time, semi-official sources here claim that since the British launched another offensive at dawn on the 31st of this month, the battle has entered its second phase. The German side is confident about the future of the battle. This final British attack copied old tactics, but still could not go far beyond the Axis outposts. The battle is now taking place on the Axis main defensive line. So far, there has been no tank battle anywhere on the front line. Yesterday, multiple air battles took place over the Al Alamein area. Groups of "Curtiss" and "Spitfire" aircraft attempted to attack Axis positions, but before reaching their destination, they were intercepted by our "Messerschmitt" aircraft. The enemy aircraft were dispersed in the high altitude, and four enemy aircraft were lost. Another team of British bombers was also driven back by our fighter planes and anti-aircraft guns, failing to carry out their bombing attempt. As for the German dive bombers, they attacked British tanks near the Al Alamein railway station and were very successful.

Reuter Dispatch from Berlin, 3rd: It is claimed here that in the recent two days, the German-Italian allied forces counter-attacked in the northern Al Alamein front, capturing 2,000 enemy soldiers, seizing 51 anti-tank guns and a large number of supplies, and destroying 100 tanks.

Central News Agency Dispatch from Lisbon, 2nd: Since the British Eighth Army launched its offensive on the Al Alamein front, it has been frequently subjected to fierce attacks from the Axis air force and artillery, and has been frustrated. Therefore, in the past two or three days, large numbers of British troops have been reinforced from Cairo and Alexandria. General Rommel, in order to implement a war of attrition strategy, deliberately avoids the main force, only using heavy artillery to bombard the British counter-attacking troops, and using tank guns to destroy British tanks. In the past two or three days, the number of British tanks destroyed by the Germans has reached 100. Since the start of the counter-offensive, the number of British tanks destroyed has reached 400. Currently, fierce ground battles are unfolding with the northwest Al Alamein area as the center. Once the Axis forces have used artillery tactics to exhaust the British tank units, they will launch a full-scale offensive.

Reuter Dispatch from Berlin, 3rd: Three Hurricane aircraft attacked a German motorcade on the coastal highway in North Africa. One of the aircraft was hit by German machine gun fire. The aircraft was severely damaged and forced to land. The Australian pilot was captured.

### Financial Authorities Deny Rumors: Reports of Currency System Change are Inaccurate

Central News Agency Dispatch from Nanjing, 3rd: Rumors have been circulating in the market for days, saying that the currency system will soon be reformed, with Central Reserve Bank notes being exchanged for new currency at a rate of four or five yuan.

### Greater East Asia Writers' Conference Opened Yesterday in Tokyo

Domei Dispatch from Tokyo, 3rd: The Greater East Asia Writers' Conference was solemnly opened at the Imperial Theater here at 10:00 AM on the 3rd. More than twenty representatives and assembly participants and guests from China, Japan, and Manchukuo attended. After the formalities, Kume Masao, Director of the Japan Literary Patriotic Association, delivered the opening address. Subsequently, all the delegates of the conference unanimously elected Japanese representative Hiroshi Shimomura as the chairman of the conference and delivered his inaugural address. Then, Sub-Director Okumura of the Information Bureau, Director Taniwaki of the Army Ministry's Press Department representing the Minister of the Greater East Asia Ministry, Section Chief Hirade of the Navy Ministry's Press Department, and Secretary-General Goto of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association delivered congratulatory speeches.

Domei Dispatch from Tokyo, 3rd: At the opening ceremony of the Greater East Asia Writers' Conference, Okumura, the Sub-Director of the Japanese Information Bureau, said in his speech that as the forces of Anglo-American aggression have been driven out of East Asia, Asia's existence has a bright future. The so-called cultural crisis of today is nothing more than the existing world culture manipulated by the United States and Britain. However, a new Asian culture has begun to regenerate in the future, so there is no cultural crisis to speak of. If we look at the culture of the United States and Britain again, we find that they only use culture as a means to protect their lives. This kind of culture is only a usurious, non-laboring culture, and also an extractive commercial culture. In contrast, Asian culture is born from the ultimate purpose of life and is a noble culture of respect for humanity and respect for labor. This culture is not only expressed in life, but also in art and religion. Therefore, Asian culture is a culture in which religion, politics, and education are integrated, and is a comprehensive and unified culture, which is completely different from the divisive culture of the United States and Britain. Under the current situation, "Pan-Asian unity" has been realized. In the future, we must use common ideals and morals to achieve shared happiness and hardship, co-existence and co-prosperity. Therefore, it is necessary for all Asian nations to realize the greatness of Asia and enhance their self-confidence. Therefore, it is hoped that all of you can become the second Muhammad, the first Confucius, and the second Sakyamuni.

### Intercepted the Mountain Road of Transcaucasia by the German Army; Artillery Fights between Two Armies on the Banks of the Volga River; Nalcrucknowledge fell

Berlin, 3rd, Havas News Agency: After the German army occupied Alagir on the Terek front, Okhiniki is threatened, and the Ossetian military road has also been cut off. Because the central Caucasus Mountains are as high as 4,000 meters, it is difficult to pass in the autumn. The Soviet army between the Terek River and Mount Elbrus has little chance of escaping. The fighting in the Stalingrad area is calm. The German engineering team has made slight progress in the industrial area on the west bank of the Volga River. The supply of the Soviet army in the city is becoming increasingly difficult.

Berlin, 3rd, Havas News Agency: It is claimed here that the only mountain road through the Central Caucasus, the Ausztians military road, has been cut off due to the German occupation of Alagir. The highway is 293 kilometers long. Alagir is located 50 kilometers west of Okhiniki. It is the terminal station of the Weistoff Grosny Railway. The surrounding land is extremely fertile. There are small arsenals and chemical plants in the city. The lead mine in the south is very rich.

Guilin, 3rd, Havas News Agency: The Caspian Sea has been bombed by German aircraft many times last week. Baku is the center of Caspian Sea transportation. It exports 9,000,000 tons of kerosene every year. However, the northern Caspian Sea freezes for about three months every year, which hinders shipping. Recently, British and American war equipment has also been transported from Iran to the Soviet Union via the Caspian Sea.

In addition, the German artillery units on the west bank of the Volga River also fiercely bombarded the Soviet artillery positions on the east bank on the 1st. The terrain of the German artillery positions is higher than that of the Soviet artillery positions on the opposite bank, so the German army has a clear advantage in the artillery battle between the two armies. In addition, the powerful anti-aircraft artillery positions of the German army on the west bank of the river have been completed recently since they were actively built.

Ankara, 3rd, Havas News Agency: Moscow telegram, after the German army occupied the city of Nalchik last Thursday, the Soviet military headquarters only admitted in the war report last night that the city had fallen.

Street fighting in Stalingrad is still going on

The Slovak army annihilated the surrounded enemy. The German army east of Alagir continued its offensive, penetrating deep into the enemy's minefields and strong defenses. The enemy army suffered heavy losses from our planes bombing. An enemy armored train was destroyed. The German army in the Kalmuk Mountains once counterattacked, repelling the invading cavalry, causing many casualties. Fierce street fighting in Stalingrad is still going on. Our rapid-descent bombers attacked the enemy's strongholds north of the city. The enemy lost ground again. Repeated counterattacks were ineffective. Our fighter squadrons bombed the railway east of the Volga River and the enemy's equipment for crossing the river. The Soviet army attempted to cross the Don River from several locations, but was severely beaten by the Romanian and Hungarian armies. Italian aircraft bombed Soviet positions at low altitude. The Hungarian army destroyed Soviet bunkers on the east bank of the Don River many times, capturing many enemies. The enemy army southeast of Lake Ilmen is still resisting stubbornly in the swampy lowlands. Last month, German aircraft sank a total of 33 Soviet transport ships and cargo ships, including many oil tankers and one patrol ship. In addition, 32 cargo ships and many warships were damaged.

### US Governor and Congressman Elections Yesterday; No Unexpected Results Expected; The Democratic Party is Expected to Still Hold a Majority

Washington, 2nd, Havas News Agency: According to the provisions of the US Constitution, all members of the House of Representatives and one-third of the senators are re-elected every two years. This year is the year of re-election, and the vote has been scheduled for the first Tuesday of this month. Governors whose terms have expired must also be re-elected at the same time. Therefore, the people of the country will be busy voting on that day. According to political observers here, this vote will not have surprising results. It is expected that the Republican Party will win some seats in both the Senate and the House of Representatives, but the Democratic Party will still hold a majority. The most noteworthy event in this election is the re-election of the Governor of New York. The State Attorney, Dewey, is the Republican candidate, while Bennett is the Democratic candidate. President Roosevelt initially supported Senator Mette as a candidate, but was opposed by the Democratic branches of Albany and New York. He decided to support Bennett. Senator Mette usually spares no effort to support the New Deal, while Bennett is a conservative member of the Democratic Party. A recent public opinion survey showed that 53% of the people supported the Republican candidate Dewey, 39% supported the Democratic candidate Bennett, and the remaining 8% supported the American Labor Party candidate Arfang. If Dewey is elected tomorrow, the Republican Party will have great hope in the 1944 presidential election. Government officials and Democrats also believe that Dewey's views on the post-war reconstruction plan are completely different from President Roosevelt's views. Therefore, they believe that Dewey's election is very dangerous. The Democratic Party has expressed its opinion that if Dewey is elected President of the United States after the current war ends, "the mistake of 1919 will be repeated." Therefore, if the Republican Party can win the next presidential election, its candidate should be Wiggy, at least in terms of foreign policy, his views are completely consistent with President Roosevelt.

### Australia will limit consumption of civilian goods

Lisbon, 3rd, Havas News Agency: According to Washington news, the United States elected 32 governors, 35 senators, and 434 representatives today. The American people are indifferent and uninterested. The general public believes that the Republican Party will gain a little. Dewey, the Republican candidate for governor of New York, may be elected. Republican leader Bretton is running for governor of the state of Okhai, and they are all opposed to Roosevelt's policies and hope to be nominated as presidential candidates in 1944.

Saigon, 3rd, Havas News Agency: According to news from Sydney, the working hours of Australian officials will be increased from five and a half days per week to six days, in order to transfer strong men to participate in national defense work.

One of the main tasks of the new authority is to unify the American broadcasting system. Fourteen private radio stations will be taken over by the government during the war, and 22 new short-wave wireless stations will be established. These radio stations will be divided into two groups, one for psychological warfare and the other for broadcasting news programs to inspire the spirit of overseas American troops and Allied troops.

### Africa in the Midst of Change: Egypt - The Second Gateway of the Center of the War (3)

The British knew that the defense plan was not just about guarding a local area, and that it would be safer to push out a few more outer layers than to guard a local area. Wasn't it advancing step by step in Libya this spring? Later, the Eighth Army could not hold it, and finally crushed Alexandria in June. The outer layers that had been painstakingly built were broken one by one. At this time, of course, we had to find a way to reorganize the troops.

According to our overall view, since the German army's left claw is preparing to spend the winter, the current article must be to pour all its strength on the right claw. On the British side, they must protect Egypt and enrich the strength of the Mediterranean Sea. If they succeed, they still want to establish a second battlefield, either Greece or Italy. It is possible. From this point of view, both sides have a mission of great importance, which is undoubtedly true. Now we need to ask how far the preparations of both sides have reached.

The outsider originally had no way to speculate on this kind of military deployment, but from the news on the newspapers, we can collect a little bit of information to get a rough idea. Let's first take a look at the two sentences spoken by General Smuts in London: "The past four years of war have taken a defensive stance and have come to an end; now the final offensive has begun..." and said, "The struggle to the death has arrived, we should not give way...".

This tone is very serious, "the final offensive" and "the struggle to the death" are not just for the current local war in Egypt; it is the beginning of a huge decisive battle. From this point of view, the preparations must be quite sufficient. What we know in front of us is that there are only ten British divisions in Egypt, but about 200,000 troops, which is too far from the 12 million troops on the 1,500-mile front of Germany and the Soviet Union last year.

When the German summer offensive was launched, we seemed to have heard that the British, American, and Soviet Union had prepared a gunpowder bag on the Near East plateau, like the Universe Bag of the Yellow-Eyebrowed Arhat. The troops needed for this kind of bag formation will never be only a few hundred thousand. From this point of view, perhaps the so-called ten British divisions only refer to the front line.

Let's take a look at the current situation of the German and Italian brothers; according to the statistics on the news, at present, General Rommel commands two tank divisions, two infantry divisions, and seven Italian divisions; all in all, there are about 200,000 troops, but Rommel met with Mr. Shi, and the article was nothing more than adding troops and generals. So the soldiers on the battlefield are only the front line.

From the perspective of the offensive and defensive situation, the German and Italian side is currently based on Libya, the front line is near Alamin, and the goals are Alexandria, Cairo, and Suez: and supplies and reinforcements, etc., must fly across the Mediterranean from the German and Italian mainland, which is inevitable Some are laborious, such as ambushes in the middle, and the British navy often attacks along the coastline, which will have some discounts.

As for the British and American Allied forces, in addition to being able to obtain most of the supplies from Egypt. In terms of ammunition, there are probably not a few prepared in the Near East. At the same time, the navy can be used along the coast to make some landing tricks. In terms of large plans, if West Africa and South Africa are arranged successfully, the American supply can be directly transported from Dakar or Liberia to Egypt, Sudan, and then to the Egyptian front line. Therefore, from the perspective of both sides, this North African war will become a very lively drama. Perhaps the world war will be settled in the North African region, which is unknown.

The above is a lot of nonsense, but I still haven't explained the three keys to the Egyptian gateway mentioned in the previous article. I'm very sorry.

These three keys are the Egyptian-Sudan Highway for transportation, the Suez for the Eurasian transportation hub, and Alexandria for the military stronghold. I have pointed them out in the previous article. I am going to take a look at each of them to see what these keys are.

The first key involves a wide range. If you want to analyze it in detail, you must start from the Three Emperors and Five Emperors, such as the history, customs, human relations, changes, mountains and rivers of Egypt and Sudan, how Egypt and Egyptian Sudan are divided, etc. In this way, there will be a lot of nonsense again, and readers only need to flip through the African geography, which is much clearer.

I just want to briefly describe the formation of the Sudan Highway here, but I also consider the repeated narration of Libya in the next article, so I can only briefly say a few words.

The situation in Egyptian Sudan has been extremely complicated and subtle since it was operated by the British. Since the British allowed Egypt to be independent and maintained a never-ending marriage, why are they unwilling to create the same situation in Sudan? First, the British are naturally stingy and will not easily give up the rights and interests in their hands. Second, in the south of Sudan, the entire southeastern half of Africa, except for Portuguese Mozambique and the French Madagascar on the sea, are all British territories, so it is a very heavy matter to separate a part of Egypt to be independent. How can we let Sudan get out of hand?

Moreover, in the summer of 1936, the Turks regained the armament of the Dardanelles Strait at the Montreux Conference, thanks to the British's behind-the-scenes efforts. Unexpectedly, this move caused Italy to send troops to Rhodes, and at the same time, Italy stationed a large army in Libya in order to prevent future troubles. The British saw Italy's various actions and also carried out large-scale military preparations in Egypt as a countermeasure. However, this disturbed the Egyptian people so much that the British gentlemen, in order to eliminate this emotional impulse of the Egyptians, resolutely established an agreement in 1936 based on the conditions of 1922 and 1930, allowing Egypt to be formally independent and allowing Egyptians to immigrate to Egyptian Sudan without restrictions.

### The Great Nile Iron Bridge

Cairo, the capital of Egypt, is the largest Islamic city on the Nile River. More than one million Africans, Orientals, and Europeans live here. There are many tourists in winter. The picture shows a bird's-eye view of the great iron bridge over the Nile River in Cairo. The wind is blowing, and people come and go like shuttles.

### It is Urgent to Improve the Retail of Oil and Sugar, Relieve the Suffering of Citizens; The Authorities Dispatched Personnel to Monitor the Sale of Sugar and the Separate Sale of Edible Oil, and the Market Can Restore to Normal

In the past week, the supply of edible oil in the city has been insufficient. Although some were obtained from the military distribution office on the 30th of last month, they were sold out soon due to the small quantity. Therefore, most of the separate sales offices have been out of stock. According to reliable sources, the recent lack of oil rations is not due to too little oil in stock, but due to the reorganization of the Asia Development Board and the temporary suspension of the office. It is expected that the situation will soon be restored to what it was a week ago.

Crack down on the black market

The police authorities in the two concessions are now considering ways to crack down on the edible oil black market. At the same time, they hope that citizens will assist in reporting. Once it is verified, the distribution will be stopped and other penalties will be imposed. Regarding the possibility of distributing oil according to the population, the Edible Oil Industry Office is scheduled to hold a council meeting on the 6th of this month to thoroughly discuss it. Recently, citizens from all walks of life have been extremely dissatisfied with the oil market situation, and there has been more criticism of the internal structure of the Oil Industry Office. The edible oil black market is actually caused by the big oil merchants in the industry. The difficulty for citizens to buy edible oil is increasing day by day. It is hoped that the edible oil distribution authorities will take necessary steps as soon as possible to relieve public suffering.

Supervise sugar sales

In order to thoroughly eliminate the sugar black market and strictly supervise the widespread sale of sugar by Class A retailers to eliminate malpractices and maintain proper food for the people, the Sugar Merchant Cooperative Business Office has appointed 116 supervisors, inspectors, and investigators. Each of the 96 retailers who distribute more than 30 bags of sugar will be assigned a supervisor to be stationed in the store to supervise the sales. The more than 300 retailers who distribute less than 30 bags of sugar will be randomly checked by inspectors and investigators to check the sales accounts from time to time. Ordinary food households must hold a citizen's certificate or residence identity certificate to purchase sugar. In addition, all Class A retail stores are strictly ordered not to secretly raise prices, reduce the amount, or engage in mixed situations. Purchasers are allowed to report them for investigation. The English "The Times" queued up to buy. The English "The Times" reported that the Shanghai Sugar Merchant Cooperative Business Office has publicly announced in the Chinese newspapers that from November 1st, citizens can purchase 5 yuan of sugar from the retail stores in their respective districts with their citizen's certificates. However, on Sunday and yesterday (2nd), residents were still seen queuing up to buy in sugar stores all over the city, and only those who were quick were able to buy only half a pound of sugar. It is heard that there are still black market transactions in sugar. Some sugar dealers actually sell 10 pounds, 20 pounds, or even 50 pounds of sugar at a secret price of 7 yuan per pound at a time. Ordinary residents have to wait for several hours in front of the sugar stores, and when it is not their turn, they often see the notice board "Sugar Sold Out" hung up high.

Supply is less than demand

Therefore, the public is still asking the authorities to intervene. Many people believe that only municipal organs can intervene and distribute sugar according to the population can control the sugar situation. According to the announcement of the Sugar Merchant Cooperative Business Office, residents of each district can purchase 5 yuan of sugar with their citizen's certificates, and it is reiterated that there is enough sugar in stock for long-term needs. However, according to the reporter's investigation, this situation does not exist. The number of Chinese and foreign residents queuing up in front of the sugar stores is increasing day by day. Most retail stores only sell sugar for 10 to 15 minutes every morning. Several retail stores on Jing'an Temple Road open at 8:00 am and start selling sugar, and sell out their allocation in ten minutes.

Half a pound per person

A manager of a store said that the store's daily allocation is 24 pounds, which is sold in 48 packages of half a pound each, instead of following the method of purchasing 5 yuan (one and a half pounds) of sugar per person set by the Sugar Merchant Cooperative Business Office. Other retail stores also sell half a pound to each customer. Chinese and foreign customers in front of each store are divided into two rows. Some families, old and young, are also mixed in the long line, waiting to buy sugar to meet their daily needs. A certain southern goods store in the Central District still forces customers to buy the same amount of other goods, which violates the regulations set by the Sugar Merchant Cooperative Business Office.

### Public buses operate from Jiangwan Road to Edward Road

The United News Agency's local news reported that, according to the Shanghai Daily News, the Huazhong Public Bus Company has opened a new route south of Suzhou Creek, starting from the Shanghai Shrine and passing through Jiangwan Road, Wusong Road, Haining Road, North Sichuan Road, Sichuan Road to Edward Road. The first public bus was seen passing Sichuan Road Bridge on Tuesday morning at 7:00 am. This new public bus is called Route 25, with a total length of 2 kilometers and a fare of 2 military notes. A bus runs every 5 to 10 minutes. There are buses going back and forth every day from 7:00 am to 10:00 pm.

### Blackout Exercise to Continue Soon

The English "The Times" reported that an officer from the Air Defense Section of the Public Concession Police Department claimed that the blackout exercise in Shanghai will be resumed in mid-month. The rumors that it will be held on the 4th or 6th are not true. The next blackout exercise will be held suddenly, so the authorities may only publish an announcement in the newspapers announcing that the blackout will be implemented between a certain day and a certain day. Residents should be prepared at any time to avoid being caught off guard.

### Rice shops sell ration rice with adulteration

In addition to the whole rice allocated for each period of population rationing, it is often mixed with broken rice. However, recently, some rice shops have mixed yellow sand, gravel, or coarse millet in the broken rice they sell in an attempt to make a profit. This kind of adulterated substance is extremely broken and mixed because the broken rice is extremely broken and mixed. It cannot be discovered until it is washed. Because substances such as coarse sand can only be removed after being washed away by water and sinking. Also, those who mix broken rice in whole rice, this kind of profiteering behavior not only violates the original intention of the authorities to regulate food for the people, but also affects the nutrition and health of residents. I hope that the rice shops will realize this as soon as possible, otherwise the authorities will take measures to crack down on them.

### Jiang Bingquan appointed as Director of the Nanshi Collection Office

Jiang is good at finance and has served in financial positions in Jiangsu Province.

### Winter Clothing Drive

The Shanghai YWCA, in view of the approaching cold weather, believes that the general poor compatriots are still struggling to find food, and how can they have the surplus to seek winter clothing. The association is preparing for the future and continues the purpose of distributing winter clothing in previous years. It has launched a winter clothing drive, hoping to sew 500 sets of new cotton clothes (1,000 pieces), each set costing 60 yuan (if there is a surplus, the number will be increased), totaling 30,000 Central Reserve Certificates, and collect 5,000 to 10,000 pieces of old cotton clothes. The committee members are now planning the sewing and distribution. All kind-hearted ladies in the society who are willing to donate money, cloth, cotton, old clothes, shoes, socks, hats, gloves, etc. and cooperate to make this a great event are welcome. The association's address is 638 Weihaiwei Road.

### Zhenjiang Fellow Association Handles Small-Scale Loans

### Rongwu Society 70th Sutra Lecture

The 70th sutra lecture of the Rongwu Sutra Society, Hong Qingdao, said in his lecture on the Taoist method: "The principle of Tao is one yin and one yang. The evolution of the great Tao begins with Lao Tzu. Once the void is judged, the pure and turbid are separated. After the creation of Hongmeng, the Five Old Emperors govern the world. Then there are the Five Sons, the Shangyuan Ziwei, the Great Emperor, called the Tianguan, who is Tang Yao. The Zhongyuan Qingxu Great Emperor is called the Diguan, who is Yu Shun. The Xiayuan Dongyin Great Emperor is called the Shuiguan, who is Xia Yu. The Three Origins circulate to govern Shenzhou. The East belongs to the Zhunti, and the West belongs to the reception. They are all disciples of the Yuanshi Daozu, who reported the teachings of the Xiantian Wuji Daozu. After Xuanyuan, the Jintian Clan ruled the central master of the thirty-three heavens, who is the Jinque Jade Emperor, surrounded by the three and two heavens in the four directions. Each heaven has an Emperor to govern the people of his teachings, which are not connected to each other. The Qingxu Great Emperor is located in the center, enlightening the poor and evolving the great law, which will be used to specially build the Xiantian, Qingji Orthodox sect, to turn the fortunes of plunder and save those who are destined." After the lecture, it was announced that the next lecture will be given by Mr. Yang Zhongyi on the study of the Book of Changes, and Mr. Zhao Buming will talk about the origin of Confucianism, Buddhism, and Christianity.

### Xu Xingbin's Birthday Celebration for Education

Xu Xingbin, a famous reporter from Zhejiang and former provincial assemblyman, will celebrate his 70th birthday on the tenth day of the tenth lunar month this year. His disciples Zhang and Xu and others plan to celebrate his birthday. Xu firmly refused. Friends in Shanghai, such as Cheng Xuechuan, Sun Jincai, and two historians, and fellow villagers, such as Xu Shenru and Shen Mianfu, used Xu's words "Who is busy for a year in Shu Huai at seventy, most of the sacrifices are in the locality" and "Arrange a good scene to plant peach and plum trees, and beg for new shade to protect the Zisang" to propose to build a school in Xu's village Zhouwang Temple as a birthday gift for Xu, saving all the pomp of the birthday celebration, and using the birthday celebration as an education fund to fulfill Xu's intention of "Celebrating the birthday and waiting for the return to the hometown". The collection offices in Shanghai are Yuanchangzhuang, Fuxingli, Beijing Road, Hangzhou is Wuyuanzhuang, Zhongqing Avenue, and Xiajiashi is Yongxingzhuang, Zhongning Lane.

### A Tour of Six Major Libraries with Rich Collections (3)

Complete Collections of Chinese and Foreign Books

Hoping the Public Cultivates a Love of Reading

Instructions for Checking the Catalog

To find the books you need, you can consult the catalog. Some catalogs are in book form, and some are in card form. The card catalog of New Asia has been locked away with the reading room and can only be consulted through the book catalog. Therefore, it has been revised several times, and new books have been added. Although Hongying has catalogs of books and magazines, and Mingfu has catalogs of Western books, they have not been maintained for many years because of the assistance of cards, and many book titles are not included. Therefore, it is advisable to consult the card catalog. The cards are divided into three types: classification cards, title cards, and author cards. When consulting, you only need to check one of the categories, titles, or authors to find it. However, the card catalogs of several major libraries are often not very complete. The Chinese book card catalog of the Public Works Department and the magazine type card catalog of Hongying often have omissions, and Zhen Dan has no author card. The same is true for the series collection of Hongying. Moreover, in the series collection, if two books are bound together, the subsequent cards are often missing, so you must check the original catalog. These are all things that newcomers should pay attention to. The method of checking cards is the same as checking a dictionary, mostly classified by stroke count, which is very easy. However, words such as "增廣" (enlarged) and "最新" (latest) should be omitted from Chinese book titles, and "The" should be omitted from English book titles.

Whether flipping through the catalog or entering the book depository, it is not so easy to find. Here, you must know some of the ways of the library. Books are arranged according to book codes, which are composed of classification codes, title codes, and author codes. The book codes currently commonly used are based on the Dewey Decimal Classification, which uses the ten digits 0 to 9 to represent ten categories: philosophy, religion, society, language, natural science, applied science (including agriculture, medicine, and domestic affairs), art, and literature, with history at the end. The arrangement of these nine categories of knowledge roughly follows a natural order, so it is easy to remember with a little attention. Everything outside of these nine categories is classified as 0 and placed before 1, called general works. The study of books and series is included in this general category. As for the further division of these ten categories into subcategories, all the way down to decimals, it has become a large book, and its complexity can be imagined. However, we only need to know the general outline to facilitate a lot.

The author code for Chinese books commonly uses the Wang Yunwu Four-Corner Numeral System, which is arranged according to the first character of the author's name. For the second code of English books, the first letter is the capital letter of the author's first name, and the following Arabic numerals are the numerical code based on the letters of the name. The last letter is the first letter of the book title. Therefore, to find a book written by someone, just find the part of that category with the first letter of the person's name.

To find the articles you need in periodicals, you must have an index. Since the Hongying Library is known for its collection of periodicals, its journal index is very useful. However, the humanities magazine index (the library was formerly named "Humanities" and published the Humanities Magazine) used before was published in installments, piecemeal, which was not easy to check. It is best to check the library's cards. All the articles on the cards are from magazines collected by the library. In addition, other major libraries in other cities have compiled indexes, such as the Lingnan Chinese Magazine Index, the Beiping National Studies Paper Index, and specialized indexes such as agricultural science papers, geographical science papers, Kunming papers, literary papers, psychological papers, and even Qing Dynasty documents. Other magazines such as Science Education have specialized indexes, and some also attach a summary (abstract) of the articles in the index. Daxia used to have summaries of historical papers, but others seem to be unseen.

Borrowing Procedures

After checking the book title in the catalog, you can write it on the borrowing slip. The number must be copied exactly, otherwise, you will often not be able to borrow it. People who borrow books for the first time often do not pay attention to these things, so they feel a lot of trouble. In fact, after understanding the meaning of the number, it is not easy to make mistakes when writing it.

Each time you can borrow about two or three books. Each library is slightly different. Some places have restrictions, and some places do not.

Among the six libraries, the books of Hongying, Customs, and Mingfu cannot be borrowed outside the library and can only be read in the library. However, the Mingfu Library is intended for members of the China Science Society. For individuals or organizations that donate more than 500 yuan, a full-year borrowing card is given, but ordinary people cannot borrow it. Borrowing books from Zhen Dan requires a temporary deposit. Chinese books are ten yuan, and Western books are twenty yuan, and it is limited to single copies, not including series. Most of the books in New Asia are very expensive. If the price is high, it depends on how much the price exceeds the deposit. Because of the early or late addition, the deposit for the library card of the library ranges from two yuan to five yuan, and then changed to five yuan in new currency. There are many levels in between, so the amount of the temporary deposit is also different. All the books of the Public Works Department can be borrowed except for reference books and series. Because the school or shop has already provided a guarantee when entering the library, there is no other deposit. (To be continued) (Note: This manuscript was written by Mr. Li Mangren. The first article was mistakenly signed "劍" (sword), which is specially corrected.)

### Another Grand Football Match is Being Promoted This Weekend or May Be Realized The Baojia Self-Defense Match Urges the Baojia Side to Pay the Ticket Money

### Holding Crabs and Appreciating Chrysanthemums

Crabs are an unfortunate species of shellfish. They have a false appearance, claiming to be "armored generals," but they are "gutless wonders." Wearing a suit of armor, they intended to roam the rivers and seas. Humans are clever after all, catering to their preferences, building crab houses, and luring them with lights. So, in groups, they throw themselves into the trap. These days, chrysanthemums are yellow beside the fence, and crabs are also on the market. I can't help but make a random chatter, just to suit the season.

The producing areas of crabs can be roughly divided into ocean, Yangtze River, and inland river. Seawater is salty, and the crabs produced are strange-looking, some as big as stone drums, or with a pair of giant claws, shaped like magic hands. The meat is old and the taste is inferior, and those who are not exceptionally stomach-endowed would not bother to ask about them. The Yangtze River has lively and clear water, producing a large number of crabs, which are also delicious. However, what Shanghainese value is in the inland river, which actually refers to the Taihu Lake basin, which is what is called "Dazha crabs". And those produced in Yangcheng Lake are even more rare, and their reputation can be compared with the Yellow River carp in Fenlingdu, Henan; the four-gilled perch under the Xiuyabridge in Songjiang; and the red-scaled shad near the Diaoyutai in Fuchun River. It is said that the spirit of heaven and earth is concentrated there, with unique characteristics: green shell, white belly, golden claws, yellow hair, full of fat and fleshy, unparalleled in freshness. There is even a story of deifying them, with a deep "王" (king) character on their backs, crawling on glass, with eight feet propping up, and the navel hanging in the air, which is indeed different from ordinary products. Therefore, crab vendors all use "Yangcheng Lake" as a slogan, and Shanghainese eat crabs, and they must be "Yangcheng Lake"! However, according to the investigation, Yangcheng Lake does not produce many crabs. Even in a big year, it is only 800 to 1,000 dans, which are distributed to various places on the Beijing-Shanghai line. How many can Shanghai get? How can enough satisfy the gluttons? Let's not worry about it for now. Anyway, eating the reputation is also a happy thing.

At the turn of autumn and winter, the big wharves in Nanshi, the 16th Pier, the Hongkou Touba, and the old Zhage Bridge along the bank are particularly tense. Because the Yangtze River boats, Su, Xi, Kun, Tai, Hang, Jia, Song, and Hu boats, must have crabs from various producing areas brought in. The crab vendors have been waiting for a long time. Once the goods arrive, they swarm up to select the goods they need. After the silver and the goods are exchanged, they choose the size, match the male and female, and place them in iron cages, displayed on the street for the public to buy.

In addition to the small vegetable markets, the lively road intersections, and the entrances of restaurants and taverns, all are concentrated places for crab stalls. Among them, the Risheng Building area is particularly large, from the Ciro's department store north to Beijing Road. The sidewalks and entrances on both sides are all occupied, forming a crab kingdom. Since there are many in the same industry, competition is inevitable. Some use neon tubes for advertising; some use loud voices to solicit customers. In addition to generally referring to the genuine Yangcheng Lake clear water crabs, there are also those who use "Crab King" as the standard. The so-called Crab King, each weighing seven or eight taels, is priced at CRB 20 yuan each. Cantonese restaurants, which are particular about decoration, have always been reluctant to let others. At this time, they are even more serious and choose one or two big crabs, and temporarily ask the tropical fish to move out of the house and keep them in glass tanks to attract diners.

The method of cooking crabs has greatly improved in recent years. In the past, they were boiled in water. The crabs could not stand the heat in the wok and would inevitably turn and scramble, causing the fat to scatter, and the meat to become old and tasteless. Ten years ago, Gao Chang and his partner invented the tying and cooking method on Fourth Malu. Before putting them in the water, they were tied with colorful ropes to make them unable to move, just like dealing with a cut criminal. This method spread and became very popular, but it is still not perfect. Because when boiled in water, the fresh taste will eventually overflow and seep into the soup. So, more improvements have been made, forming today's most sophisticated steaming and charcoal grilling methods. And charcoal grilling can be called the only major invention in the 20th-century Oriental diet. The cooked crabs are fresh, tender, and full of fat, and the color, aroma, and taste are all excellent.

The art of eating, progressing from barbarism to civilization, is a natural process. But in extreme civilization, with a slightly barbaric way, the original flavor, is often unique. Beggar's chicken is suddenly appreciated by the literati. When eating roasted mutton in the north, you must hold a glass of white wine in one hand and put one leg on the stool to taste good. The twelve beauties in the Grand View Garden are tired of tasting delicacies, so they secretly get a piece of venison, cook it randomly, and everyone fights for it, happy and excited. It seems that at that time, there was also a black market for pork in Nanjing. The way of eating crabs is undoubtedly more barbaric, and the fun is in the barbarism.

There is a common saying that "beggars eat dead crabs, every one is good." It can be seen that eating crabs has a style. The most elegant thing is to hold a crab and appreciate chrysanthemums at the same time. Before the war, Xiaoguan Garden in Jiangwan, the Municipal Agricultural Ground in Pudong, and the Guanshengyuan Agricultural Ground in Caohejing were all famous for cultivating chrysanthemums, with a rich variety of good varieties. Every year on this day, a chrysanthemum exhibition must be held for people to admire. If you are familiar with the garden owner, or introduce yourself through acquaintances, you can also bring wine and crabs to enjoy the flowers and hold a banquet on the spot. Guanshengyuan Agricultural Ground even thinks of customers and has a catering department, which specially sends people to purchase Yangcheng Lake crabs and sell them on the spot. This kind of heroic victory has become a thing of the past and is nowhere to be found. The reporter thinks that holding crabs and appreciating chrysanthemums is certainly a good fun, but it is not necessary to force them into one thing. Shanghai has too many people who are fond of elegance, as if appreciating chrysanthemums is not pleasant without holding crabs; and holding crabs is not elegant without appreciating chrysanthemums. The annual chrysanthemum meeting in the brothel is hailed as a grand event, and the branches and trunks of chrysanthemums are forcibly bent and tied into a dipper of pearls and baby's breath, which is vulgar enough, and then piled up into a mountain. Wine and flower stands, a group of vulgar bones, after being drunk and full, casually eat a few crab cavities, and if this is called elegant, it is really dare not flatter! (To be continued)

Business News

### Public Bonds are Tired of Thinking About Revival

The public bond grey market rebounded slightly yesterday, but the big drop and small rebound did not show stability. However, speculators only did temporary speculative transactions, and short sellers also made up for it, resulting in a rebound of one yuan and several angles in the market. The trend may lead to a situation of suppressing first and then raising. The market was still weak at the opening, and both Ding and Wu types were within 50 yuan. The use of Type B was also smaller than the previous day. After rising, it fell back to below the previous day's price. At the close, the bulls tried their best to pull it up, and it rebounded slightly. In terms of news, it is still a consistent policy to consider anything above 50 yuan as illegal. However, if it falls to the 50 yuan level, there may be a longer period of hovering. That is, when the Public Enterprise Exchange opens in the future, the authorities will not open it especially above 50 yuan. This is the crux of the public bond market price, and the reason for the rise and fall. Originally, it was above par, and this newspaper had already stated it in advance, but the general public was still obsessed and did not pay attention to it. As a result, the market price rose by one yuan to two yuan across the board, and there were very few 96 transactions. The only exception was a rise of 3.1 yuan, which was the most. The total transaction volume was about 3 million yuan. The summary table is listed below:

### Chinese Stocks Rise and Fall Unevenly

Yesterday, the Chinese stock market rose first and then fell back, which was due to the actual goods being sold high. However, several old stocks are still progressing upward. Yongxiang Printing and Minyi Pharmaceutical have the right to recognize the new shares of Sanle Industrial, and investment is still strong. Other stocks eventually rose and fell unevenly. The textile industry was the weakest. Yongan Textile only opened at 1,856 yuan, a small drop of 60 yuan. Meilun Woolen, Shanghai Cotton Weaving, and Dazhonghua Weaving all rebounded by a small amount of 0.5 to 2.5 jiao. In the department store industry, Yongan and Guohuo rose by one yuan each, and Xinxin fell to 139.5 yuan. Underwear fell by 0.5 jiao.

Yongxiang was a blockbuster, appearing at a high price of 30 yuan, and then at 28 yuan, a huge rise of 13 yuan. Nanyang Yan Cao rose to 112.5 yuan, and Dazhonghua Matches was 268 yuan, and the trend has stabilized.

Daxin Electrical Appliances, a large household, saw a high price of 17.5 yuan yesterday, Vita Wealth is still around 25 yuan, and Gongli Bus and Xinhua Lacquer are firm, and the transaction is normal. The market price list for today is recorded below:

### Jewelry Gold Unchanged

Yesterday, the gold shops in this city and the Da Xin industry issued a price of 2,550 yuan per tael of jewelry gold (about 300 yuan less for purchases), which has not changed. The inter-industry price has little change. It was initially 2,310 yuan, and then it rose slightly to 1,2315 yuan, and then fell back. At noon, it was 2,310 yuan, the same as the previous day. The transaction was sparse, and the final price was 2,320 yuan, which was quite high. As for jewelry and patterned silver, it was still 14 yuan per tael, which has not changed. The inter-industry price was 12.35 yuan for supply and demand. Yesterday, the Qianye Gonghui's discount rate changed little and remained at 1.4 jiao.

Yesterday's foreign exchange market, the Japanese military ticket trended flat, and the inter-industry price was 5 yuan, 5 jiao, 5 fen and 57 li. The silver shop and the small money shop sold it at 5 yuan, 5 jiao, 6 fen and 6.5 fen, and bought it at about 5 fen.

### Cloth Still Tight

Factory Cloth The market rose again yesterday, and the goods continued to be tight. 16-pound Earth coarse cloth was 225 yuan, the same pound of Feihong was 31 yuan, 9-pound Xinzi was 125 yuan, 8-pound Zhenzhong was 122 yuan, 12-pound Earth fine cloth was 184 yuan at noon, and the afternoon market needed 186 yuan. Dapeng Fugui Xin Dan shouted at 183 yuan to 4 yuan, and the bank order was 177 yuan, and someone wanted it. Taohua Nvshi Lin received the price at 270.5 yuan in the afternoon, and 274.75 yuan was traded, and Chuji Shilin was 265 yuan, and An An Lan was 210 yuan in dark color, all with demand and no supply.

Dong Cloth The price rose after the initial flat, and the prices rose. 12-pound Longtou fine cloth Xinxin Dan was 193 yuan to 4.5 yuan, the bank order was 185.25 yuan, and Caiqiu was 185.5 yuan, all short of supply. Sijunzi Serge Hong Dan was 7 yuan, 3 jiao, 78 points, and rose to 7 yuan, 4 jiao, 56 points. After the noon closing, the fine yarn was reported to rise to 7 yuan, 5 jiao, 34 points, and there was still demand.

### Bean Cake Sales are Strong

In the miscellaneous grain market, the arrival of goods was still sparse yesterday, and only bean cakes were traded. The market situation was trending strong. It is estimated that 500 pieces of Kai Changji bean cakes were priced at 73 yuan, and 1,000 pieces were delivered in two weeks at 73.5 yuan. One cart of Yuanlong bean cakes was priced at 74 yuan, and three carts of Fei Zi bean cakes were priced at 75 yuan to 76 yuan.

### Commercial Briefs

Soft Cakes are Tight The previous batch of arrivals has been almost sold out. According to the customer's telegram, several dozen pieces of the next batch are being shipped and are on the way to Shanghai. The cost must be at least 100 yards more than before. If the cake blank is soft and glutinous and bright in color, it will definitely continue to rise. Jinshan branches are slightly loose and cheap, and the market has returned to flat due to the slightly sluggish sales. Yesterday, I heard that the number was more than 200 pieces, slightly lower than before, and the goods fluctuated slightly, with a difference of 20 yards high and low, which was immediately opened. However, the production price is still hard, and the source is not easy. There is no hope of excessive loosening in the future.

Medium-Grained Ganbei is Flat The market sells for 5,100 to 200 yuan. Triangular Ganbei is in short supply. I heard that the consortium has already transported a batch, but it has not yet been opened.

Daily Necessities Have Less Supply Than Demand In the daily necessities market, such as the dwindling inventory of soap, the owners are trying harder to thicken the bottom, creating a situation where there is less supply than demand, causing the price to rise higher and higher. Gu Ben soap has risen to 375 yuan, Bai Xiangmao is 320 yuan, Huang Xiangmao is 280 yuan, and Scissors soap is 330 yuan, which is 5 to 10 yuan higher than before. Matches are temporarily stable, with Meili at 2,550 yuan, Phoenix at 2,350 yuan, Jindin at 2,250 yuan, and miscellaneous brands at 1,850 yuan, with no honor or disgrace. The candle market is still popular, with White Reeve's Ship Brand reaching 180 yuan, Hump Cap Brand at 155 yuan, and miscellaneous brands at 130 yuan. The pharmaceutical market has a strong underlying trend, which is generally caused by hoarders. There are also rumors of gossip Dan's chemical reproduction and various profitable purchases, so those who hold the goods are even more profitable, and the price is rising daily. Bagua Dan is priced at 26 yuan, Mentholatum is 30 yuan, and headache powder is 25.5 jiao, all priced per dozen. Crane Vegetable is 58 yuan, Longhu Rendan is 24 yuan, and Invincible Tooth Powder is 9.5 jiao, and the selling prices are all trending upward.

### On Li Yuzhi's Future

— Su Shaoqing

Li Yuzhi is one of the four famous female Dan performers from the Beiping Opera School. The fourth class of the Beiping Opera School was known for its "Jade" (玉) designation, with the female roles each named after beautiful flowers and fragrant herbs. Among them, the "Four Jades" were particularly prominent: Hou Yulan, Li Yuru, Bai Yuwei, and Li Yuzhi. The first three Jades had already come to Shanghai in succession, leaving with great acclaim, with Li Yuzhi being the last to arrive. Some wondered why Yuzhi was so late in coming. There is a reason for this: Yuzhi is the youngest. The arrival of the Four Jades in the South resembles a kind of "marriage," with the order of marriage following the rule of "eldest first, then youngest." The younger ones usually wait until their older sisters have achieved success before becoming brides themselves. This is an ancient custom, and deviating from this order would not be appropriate. Examining common principles, among many sisters, the youngest is often the most intelligent and favored. Yang Guifei's sisters, the Duchess of Qin and the Second Duchess, were undoubtedly beautiful, but still paled in comparison to Guifei. Furthermore, consider the drama of Wang Baochuan. The two older sisters, Jin Chuan and Yin Chuan, were less intelligent and capable than the third sister, and their fame was also less. This is irrefutable proof that, although the Four Jades are not blood sisters, the precedent might be similar. It is also rumored that Yuzhi was ill for over a year, which was a major reason for her inability to seek opportunities in the South earlier.

Although I have seen few of Yuzhi's performances, I can predict that her future holds even greater promise than the other three Jades. Why do I say this? I observe that she is more intelligent and capable of playing both Qingyi and Huadan roles. Her voice, singing, appearance, and stage skills are all above average. In today's opera world, a performer must be able to play three types of roles to satisfy the audience's demands. For example, a Dan role should be proficient in Qingyi, Huadan, and Daoma (female warrior) techniques, and possess excellent voice, appearance, and martial skills to be considered a "complete" performer. However, it is difficult to excel in all three. A Qingyi role who can also perform Huadan roles with flair can also become very popular. Simply focusing on Qingyi roles is often not well-received by the public. Yuzhi excels in Qingyi singing and is also skilled in various Huadan roles. I see her eyes sparkle with spirit, and she has dimples on her cheeks. Every time she smiles, she is exceptionally beautiful. Her figure is petite and suitable for agile movements. In plays like "Mei Long Zhen" and "Wen Zhang Hui," she is confident and certain to succeed. She is truly a budding Huadan talent. The other three Jades either excel in Qingyi but are unsuitable for Huadan roles, or are only good at Huadan roles with poor singing and voice. They have still gained fame and recognition. Considering this, how can Yuzhi's future be measured?

### Opera World News

The Gengxin Stage has already engaged Tong Zhiling, Chi Shigong, and Yan Shishan to succeed Li Zongyi, Li Yuzhi, and Li Duokui. As for the existing supporting actors, such as Fu Dewei, Guan Dexian, Ci Shaoquan, Wang Yurang, Yin Jinzhen, and Gao Desong, they will all be retained. However, the young male actor Zhou Weijun will be replaced by Jiang Shiyu because Zhou has other engagements in Beiping and cannot stay in Shanghai for long.

The Tianchan Stage has recently engaged Yang Baosen and Zheng Bingru. Yang and Zheng have agreed to collaborate without prioritizing each other. The playbills will be printed with both names equally to show their partnership. Yesterday, Bingru sent a letter stating that the agreement has been finalized, and the payment has been received. She will arrive by plane around the 6th of this month, with her stage debut expected around the 10th.

Huangjin, Wu Suqiu, and Ye Shengzhang will perform until the 6th of this month and will not continue their engagement. Starting from the 7th, the FULIANCHENG Little Class will take over the evening performances. As for Cheng Yanqiu's Qiu Sheng Society, they have decided to start performing on the evening of the 11th. The leading actor, Guan Shengxi, and the supporting cast are expected to arrive in the South by train in the next few days and should reach Shanghai soon.

After leaving Shanghai, Wu Suqiu will first go to Tianjin to perform short plays at the invitation of the China Grand Theatre. The young male actor Yu Zhenfei will accompany her. It is rumored that Yu's decision to join Wu's troupe was facilitated by Zhu Fuchang, the president of the Beiping Drama Newspaper, with a monthly salary of approximately six thousand yuan from the Federal Reserve. Song Baoluo and Song Ziping are performing at the Kaiming Grand Theatre in Suzhou. Their engagement has been extended repeatedly, and ticket sales remain strong. After repeated requests, they have agreed to extend their performances for another ten days, until the 10th of this month. They will then lead their troupe back north, with one report suggesting they will perform short plays in Ningbo.

### Li Jianwu's "Yun Caixia" Premieres

— Yi Xiang

Xia Xia's Last Performance Before Leaving Shanghai; Gu Degang Makes a Comeback to Co-star

The Shanghai theater scene is gradually forming a three-way split. "Shangyi" is stationed at the Carlton, establishing its resurgence with the "Great Circus." The "Zhongzhong" Theater relies on its internal resources at the Lihua, hiring Wu Renzhi and others to strengthen its efforts. The "Lyceum" will be staging performances by the emerging Yiguang Theater Company starting on October 6th. "Yiguang" is a transformation of "Huayi," but with the addition of Xia Xia, Gu Degang, Lin Bin, and others, its momentum is strong. The first play is Li Jianwu's "Yun Caixia," directed by Zhu Ruijun.

"Yun Caixia" is a five-act tragicomedy set against the backdrop of the life of a renowned female opera star. It also depicts the patrons of wealthy gentlemen and the backstage life of Peking Opera troupes. It reminds one of the novel "Qiu Haitang," which was also very popular. "Yun Caixia" not only shares similarities with "Qiu Haitang" but also has many intricate plots and moving stories, which are rare in recent plays. The cast includes Xia Xia, Gai Lan, Huang Zongjiang, Huang Zongying, Jiang Tianliu, and Wang Qi, among others. There is also exciting news that Gu Degang, the leading actor who won widespread support when the Shanghai Drama Society established itself with "Ren Zhi Chu," has joined as a guest performer after being away from the stage for three years. This will undoubtedly add much to "Yun Caixia."

Xia Xia has decided to take a trip in the near future, around this month. It is likely that she will not return to Shanghai for a while. "Yun Caixia" is her last performance before leaving Shanghai. Audiences who enjoy Xia Xia's acting will surely want to see her work one more time.

### Anti-Tuberculosis Film Exhibition Opens Tomorrow

— Liang

The film industry, which has been silent for a long time, will be fully active again starting tomorrow. The Shanghai Anti-Tuberculosis Movement Committee's exhibition of famous photographic works will be opened by Dr. Mei Lanfang and twenty famous socialites, ushering in the event for the city's residents.

The new building at the intersection of Jing'an Temple Road and Dahua Road is truly ideal for photographic exhibitions! All nine rooms on the three floors are filled with approximately three hundred photographs of various sizes. The most outstanding are the more than sixty masterpieces by renowned photographer Lang Jingshan. The stunning scenery and delicate portraits showcase the rapid progress of modern photographic art. They bring people ideals and inspiration, deeply permeating the comprehensive expression of truth, goodness, and beauty. Works by Lu Shifu, Chen Chuanlin, Hu Boxiang, and others can also be described as artistic crystallizations, with each facet reflecting human intelligence, wisdom, and skill. The exhibition will last for about ten days. Although it is not "free of charge," those who know its content and see it with their own eyes believe that spending a few yuan on tickets and two or three hours immersing themselves in the appreciation of art, indirectly helping impoverished tuberculosis patients, is a very worthwhile endeavor with multiple benefits.

### Wang Xichun Returns to the Silver Screen

While the China Film Studio was being reorganized, Wang Xichun did not join due to being in the early stages of her marriage. However, both the studio and countless fans hoped that Wang Xichun would continue to work under the spotlight. Now, that wish has finally come true. Wang Xichun has officially signed a special contract with the China Film Studio under strong public support. Her first film has also been decided upon: "Meiniang Ballad," directed by Tu Guangqi. Isn't "Meiniang Ballad" supposed to star Chen Yanyan? Why is it being reassigned? There is a reason for that. From "Madame Butterfly" to "Fanhua Xudu," Chen Yanyan has starred in several tragedies. The content of "Meiniang Ballad" is also filled with suffering and despair. Therefore, Chen Yanyan requested the company to allow her to act in some comedies. Coincidentally, Wang Xichun joined the studio, so "Meiniang Ballad" will mark Wang Xichun's return to the silver screen. The other actors, such as Yan Jun and Zhang Wan, will remain the same.

### Mei Shou

— Xiao

Dr. Mei Lanfang celebrated his 49th birthday at his private residence the day before yesterday. People from the opera world, including Cheng Yanqiu and dozens of relatives and friends, went to offer their congratulations. However, there were few foreign guests, as Mei did not want to make a lavish display due to the changing times. Furthermore, he has been suffering from a severe cold and has been responding to external engagements less often. Rumors that he has shaved off his short beard are not true.

### Sharing the Same Boat Through Storms

— He Jia Zhi

(10) Feilai Peak

Wei Cheng took down his father's portrait from the wall. His father's portrait had been hanging for longer than his mother's. The nails were rusty, and the rope was frayed. The dust on the rope and frame was also thicker. Just as Wei Cheng lifted the frame, "clatter" it fell to the ground. He couldn't even catch it in time. He hurriedly followed the frame down, picked it up, and placed it back on the table. But the glass had shattered into seven or eight pieces, and some had fallen out of the frame. Wei Cheng opened his mouth, filled with indescribable shame. He thought that there were several other frames at home and wondered if the sizes would match the photo. He turned the frame over, removed a piece of the backing, and wanted to take out his father's portrait to reframe it. But an astounding discovery was made at that moment.

Between the backing and the photo was a half-length portrait of a man, either four or six inches in size. Having ten of these photos would not be unusual, but what was strange was the inscription next to the photo. On the right were the words "To Madam Huifen for her safekeeping," and on the left were the words "From Cheng Bingjin." The sight of the names Huifen and Cheng Bing entered his mind, and he couldn't help but be surprised, so surprised that he almost became paralyzed. Huifen was the name of the eldest Mrs. Ye, and Cheng Bing was the enemy with whom he had a vendetta for his father's death. How could he not be surprised? He suddenly walked to the door and closed both panels, then returned to the table, picked up the photo, and examined it carefully. He looked to see if the character Bingjin was correct, and there was no mistake. Then he looked at the person in the photo, Cheng Bing, who had a square face and large ears and was between twenty and thirty years old. He held the photo in his left hand and clenched his right fist, trying to hit Cheng Bing's face. He gritted his teeth so hard that they creaked. If fire could truly come out of one's eyes, his would have already been blazing. His heart was pounding in his chest. He beat his fist against his chest, wanting to exhale, but he was so suffocated that he couldn't. When he looked again, Cheng Bing's face seemed familiar, but he couldn't remember where he had seen it before. He put the photo on the table, held his head, and thought for a moment. He walked back and forth in the room, looking at the photo, and finally, he remembered. (220)
