### Far Eastern Area of the Don Bend: Fierce Battle at Krasnaya; Stalingrad Feels Threatened; Soviets Transfer Reserve Troops to Defend the City

Lisbon, 30th (Alliance News Agency dispatch) – According to a Reuters dispatch from London, it is admitted that after yesterday's fierce fighting, General Timoshenko's forces in the Caucasus are in grave danger. The German army's combat capabilities are deemed superior to those of the Red Army in all aspects. General von Bock has deployed his vanguard infantry in the Tsimlyanskaya area over the past 24 hours. Simultaneously, the railway from Stalingrad to Krasnodar has been cut in several places by the German air force and its advancing infantry.

Bear City, 30th (Regional Alliance News Agency dispatch) – German forces that have penetrated the Northern Caucasus have reached the Stalingrad-Krasnodar railway south of the Don River. General von Bock is leading his forces to press closer to Stalingrad, reportedly reaching the Krasnaya area at the far eastern end of the Don Bend. This is consistent with German announcements that Soviet forces' retreat route eastward within the Don Bend has been cut off, and that fighting in this area has been particularly fierce in recent days. The battle in the Don Bend has been ongoing for five days, with German forces, especially tank units, penetrating deeply into Soviet lines. Soviet sources claim that the German vanguard, which has crossed the Don River, comprises 10,000 tanks and thousands of German bombers, launching a full-scale offensive. German tanks are reportedly crossing the Don River around Tsimlyanskaya to reinforce the German vanguard (on the Stalingrad-Krasnodar railway line), which has reportedly occupied Proletarskaya. This move is a wedge-shaped penetration into the heartland of the Northern Caucasus, posing a greater threat to Soviet forces attempting to stem the German advance.

Stockholm, 30th (Havas dispatch) – Fierce fighting is currently taking place on the southern front from the Isk district (southwest of Rostov) to the eastern bank of the Don River. Red Army resistance appears extremely fierce. According to the latest reports, the Stalingrad-Krasnodar railway has been bombed by enemy aircraft, disrupting traffic. General von Bock's vanguard has reached the city of Pololer-Tanskaya, which is in the Tsimlyansk area. Although the Germans have seized key points, the German advance has been blocked by the Red Army, and German casualties are heavy, no less than 1,500 men. According to Berlin sources, German forces were still engaged in mopping-up operations yesterday between Bataisk and the Sea of Azov, but the focus of the eastern front is still on the southern route. The German High Command's main effort is currently concentrated on the southern bank of the Don. According to Red Army reports, fierce fighting is taking place in the Krasnaya area, with German tanks attempting to cross the river, but they have not succeeded. This news may add a new factor to the German plan to attack the Volga River. As of today, Stalingrad seems most threatened from the west and southwest, but the German attempt to cross the river in that area, and General von Bock's desire to break through the Red Army's defenses north of Stalingrad, so as to bring the city under a German pincer strategy, can be clearly seen here. According to German sources yesterday, General Timoshenko has transferred his reserve troops to the area around Stalingrad for combat. The Soviet side also claims that the Red Army's positions on the right bank of the Don River remain unshaken. As for the German air force, it is quite active over the front lines, constantly bombing Soviet railways, especially emphasizing the Astrakhan-Saratov railway, because this railway is the only British supply line in central Russia.

### Voroshilov Appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Southern Front; Major Battle Expected on the Kuban Plain; Soviet Forces in Northern Caucasus Mobilized

Somewhere on the Soviet border, 29th (Havas dispatch) – Today is the 403rd day of the German-Soviet war. The front line battles are generally as follows: (1) German forces in the Don region have clearly reached their key objectives and have cut the Red Army on the southern front into two sections. The German vanguard in the Selyansky District is only ten miles away from the Krasnodar-Stalingrad railway line. All traffic on this line has been blocked by German air force bombing. Traffic on the Kelmuk Plain behind the railway line is almost cut off. The northern and southern sections of the Red Army on the southern front can only communicate via the Caspian Sea. According to Italian sources, General Voroshilov has been appointed commander-in-chief of the southern front, and General Timoshenko remains in command of the forward positions in the Don River delta. (2) Two German forces in the Rostov area are advancing on the Kuban area and the Caucasus. The first force, after occupying Rostov and Bataysk, has reached Kagarlik near the Sea of Azov. The second force crossed the Don River east of Rostov, turned northeast, crossed the Sal and Manysh Rivers, and is now advancing towards the Rostov and Elista railway hub. It is widely believed that a major battle will unfold on the Kuban Plain. The German forces will not advance southeast, because the Kelmuk Plain is a swampy area, unsuitable for motorized units. (3) The situation on the Don River delta and Stalingrad fronts is increasingly unfavorable to the Red Army. Red Army units are now fighting fiercely in the Kalach District. Although reinforcements and heavy tanks have arrived to support them, German forces are advancing along the north and south sides of Kalach, which may result in the encirclement of Stalingrad. It is rumored that the city is already within range of German heavy artillery fire. (4) Voronezh remains a weak point in the German defense line. The German side claims that Red tanks continue to attack the area, but not as fiercely as before. The Soviet side claims that the Red Army has broken through the German lines in two places south of Voronezh. (5) According to Italian sources, a portion of the Soviet light fleet, mainly gunboats, managed to slip away from Rostov in time, via the Don River, to the Volga Canal. They were able to take refuge in the Volga River. It is also learned that some Red Army units attempted to pass through the Korch area, but after a landing attempt, they were repulsed by German artillery.

Somewhere on the Ukrainian border, 29th (Havas dispatch) – German forces, who started attacking Stalingrad on the 23rd of this month, continued to advance today and gained another foothold on the Don River in the Tyssaryno area, 40 miles northwest of Stalingrad. Another large German force continued to advance eastward. Last night, they reached the railway line from Moscow to Stalingrad. The German strategy of encircling Stalingrad is rapidly progressing. According to German sources, German forces are advancing towards the city of Dubovka on the Volga River. Generally, the German High Command will order a frontal attack on Stalingrad after the German forces have invaded the Volga River basin. Judging from the current situation, the section of the Don River basin from Voronezh to Rostov is completely in German hands. The Red Army's defense of the two sections of the Don River totals only 40 miles. In the Donets River basin, although the Red Army has reached the river, it has failed to cross it, and the German forces are attacking in two directions, threatening to encircle the Red Army. Further south, German forces on the lower Don River are still engaged in mopping-up operations, reaching the city of Kruglyak yesterday. Military observers are deeply surprised by the Red Army's failure to resist resolutely in the Don River basin. However, some people believe that the Red Army High Command has made a systematic retreat, maintaining the strength of its forces, so that it can establish a new defense line near the Caucasus and continue to resist. This view has become increasingly powerful in recent days.

Stockholm, 30th (Reuters dispatch) – A Moscow United Press dispatch reports that Soviet forces in the Northern Caucasus are fighting desperately for their survival. Their situation is becoming increasingly difficult after railways and highways have been destroyed by German aircraft. In addition, German ground and air forces are constantly attacking Soviet positions.

### German-Soviet War Reports

Führer Headquarters, 30th (Reuters dispatch) – Today's German military report stated that German forces south of Rostov are fighting fiercely with the enemy's rearguard.

Yesterday, German Württemberg and Baden army mechanized units destroyed 68 enemy tanks. After completing reconnaissance work, our fighter squadrons assisted the army in attacking the enemy.

A Hungarian battalion was annihilated.

Rostov in Ruins

Stockholm, 29th (Havas dispatch) – After the Red Army abandoned the key southern Soviet fortress of Rostov, German authorities allowed foreign visitors to inspect the site yesterday. Only 15 houses remained in the city, and the desolate scene was even worse than Sevastopol after the battle. However, about half of the city's 520,000 residents remained in place, while the rest had mostly retreated with the army or had gone missing. The whole city was in ruins, and it was almost impossible to reach the banks of the Don River, as the roads were piled high with broken cars, guns, artillery, tanks, and ordnance, which the Red Army had no time to take away during the retreat.

### Britain and the United States Announce Merchant Ship Losses; No Agreement Reached

London, 29th (Havas dispatch) – Deputy Prime Minister Major Attlee announced in the House of Commons today that, to date, the Allied countries have not reached any agreement on the announcement of merchant ship losses. It is difficult to say at this time whether Britain and the United States are prepared to issue a joint statement on this matter. Generally speaking, British ships and sailors receive complete protection to avoid being attacked. At this point, Labor MPs and Wilmot stood up and spoke, stating that a large convoy of merchant ships was said to be sailing to a certain important location, but due to insufficient protection from the Admiralty, many merchant ships were lost as a result.

Washington, 29th (Havas dispatch) – The Navy Department has just announced that on the 24th of this month, a small American cargo ship was sunk by a submarine using a torpedo 150 miles off the Atlantic coast of the United States. Several rescued sailors have landed at an eastern port.

### Indian Viceroy Calls Administrative Council to Discuss Two Proposals on the Indian Issue

Lisbon, 29th (Reuters dispatch) – According to a Reuters dispatch from New Delhi, the Indian Viceroy's Administrative Council convened here on the morning of the 29th. The content has not been officially released, but well-informed sources here believe that the content of the discussion includes: (1) the US-British proposal on the issue of Indian independence after the war; (2) the proposal to convene a round table conference immediately to resolve the opposing views of various factions in India. However, the Viceroy's Administrative Council will issue a general statement on the Indian issue before the National Congress Party's conference to be held in Mumbai on August 7, in order to disintegrate the anti-British forces. However, it is doubtful how the anti-British forces, which have spread like wildfire throughout India, can be disintegrated.

Stockholm, 30th (Reuters dispatch) – A British press release states that the Royal Conference was held in New Delhi yesterday to discuss the possibility of the Allied countries guaranteeing Indian independence after the war, and to debate the method of convening a round table conference to discuss resolving the Indian issue before the end of the war.

### British Position on India Remains Unchanged

Lisbon, 30th (Alliance News Agency dispatch) – According to London sources, British Secretary of State for India Amery recently stated that Britain's position on India has not changed since Sir Cripps put forward his proposals regarding the future constitution. If Indian leaders insist on their "quit India" attitude, the British authorities will take "all possible steps" to deal with it. Amery's warning was issued today when a Member of Parliament in the House of Commons asked about the impending launch of a disobedience movement by the Standing Committee of the Indian National Congress. Labor MP Ammon asked about the British government's intentions regarding the current Indian issue. Amery replied that if concessions were made to Indian leaders, the vast and complex machinery of the Indian government would be completely disrupted. Ammon also asked whether it would not be better for the British government to openly seek compromise with India, without losing face, instead of issuing threats. Amery replied, "We have exhausted our power to do so." This statement indicates that the British government resolutely refuses to acknowledge India's viewpoint.

### From the Eastern Front to Western Europe: German Shock Troops Arrive in Paris; Anglo-American Opening of a Second Front Questioned; Rumors of a Decision in London

Paris, 30th (Haitong News Agency) – German shock troops transferred from the Eastern Front to Western Europe, commanded by General Lundstedt, to strengthen defenses, arrived in Paris yesterday. As these troops moved from the eastern to the western part of the city, crowds gathered along the streets to watch. General Lundstedt and the commander of the shock troops, Dietrich, conducted a review lasting four hours. The column of troops stretched for one hundred kilometers, and the magnificent military display was praised by all observers. The German military equipment included light armored vehicles, heavy tanks, motorized heavy artillery, anti-aircraft guns, and flat-trajectory guns, all of the latest models. Parisian newspapers reported that with the German reinforcement of Western Europe, any British attempt to invade the continent would be disastrous.

Berlin, 30th (Central News Agency) – To counter the Allied attempt to open a second front, Germany has recently completed a major fortified line along the French coast. During a meeting between German military authorities and a group of journalists on the 19th, the journalists' questions focused particularly on the possibility of a second front being opened. The German military authorities declared that they were fully prepared for any Allied attempt to fight on the continent. They stated that the German military authorities had never relaxed their vigilance and defense against British and American attempts to land in Europe. The most likely place for a British landing was Western Europe, closest to the British coast. However, the German forces defending this area had constructed a strong fortress that could be called the "Western Wall of the European Coast," providing comprehensive defense. Furthermore, Norway was also considered a potential landing site, and similar strong fortifications had been built there. Today, Britain and the United States might feel compelled to launch a landing operation in Europe due to repeated demands from the Soviet Union for a second front. However, under the strong German defenses, such efforts were futile.

Lisbon, 30th (Haitong News Agency) – New York radio broadcast a dispatch from London carried by the New York Times, stating that the negotiations in London regarding the opening of a second front had concluded, and a decision was said to have been reached. However, the timing and location of the second front's opening were unknown. Only a few people were privy to the details.

Stockholm, 30th (Haitong News Agency) – A London dispatch last night reported that people in Britain were still actively discussing whether or not to open a second front. Downing Street held a meeting to discuss the matter, but London newspapers and foreign journalists were unable to ascertain the intentions and strategies of the British government. Due to a lack of reliable information, rumors were rampant in London. Left-wing figures continued to advocate for the early opening of a second front. However, London newspapers stated that launching a landing in Europe would inevitably lead to serious dangers. The Daily Herald, the organ of the Labour Party, which usually supported a second front, also said that attacking the European continent was extremely dangerous with very little hope of success. Only The Times and the News Chronicle still advocated for the immediate opening of a second front. Roosevelt's recent meeting with military advisors in Washington had attracted considerable attention in Britain. It was widely believed that the second front issue must have been discussed.

Washington, 29th (Havas News Agency) – Talk of opening a second front has simultaneously cooled down in both Britain and the United States. According to sources in charge, this plan has either been abandoned or indefinitely postponed. The reasons are nothing more than the following: (1) a shortage of merchant ships, insufficient to transport and maintain the normal supplies of millions of expeditionary troops; (2) it is reported that the German army has built defensive fortifications along the coast of France, Belgium, and the Netherlands. Military experts say that these fortifications are similar to the Maginot Line. If the Allied forces want to pass through this line, they must emulate the German strategy of bombing the port of Sevastopol in the Soviet Union, launching an organized aerial bombardment. However, the Allied forces do not seem to have a strong enough air force to carry out this arduous task. This is also a fact. Britain and the United States recently held a meeting in London, with the focus of the discussions being the possibility of opening a second front. Labour Minister Bevin was the only member of the British cabinet to openly advocate for this, but his motives were simply those of a self-important meddler provoking the enemy to cause trouble. As for Washington, government officials have remained silent on the matter. Furthermore, it is reported that Soviet newspapers themselves have abandoned the demand for a second front and are instead demanding that the Allies supply the Soviet Union with more military equipment.

### Goebbels Publishes Essay

Berlin, 30th (Haitong News Agency) – German Propaganda Minister Dr. Goebbels published an essay in a German-Italian magazine, stating that attempting to invade Asia would be a "mad act." Discussing the possibility of opening a second front, he said that if Britain wanted to attack the European continent, he would express a "sincere welcome" and hoped that the United States would also send troops to participate in this war. The United States would engage with the German army for the first time. Although German soldiers do not carry tennis rackets or golf clubs, they do carry excellent weapons and have gained combat experience on various European battlefields. They are happy to take this opportunity to make it clear to the American army that the American army is also forbidden from entering Europe. Goebbels pointed out that, according to Soviet sources, German troops froze to death 3,000,000 people from December of last year to March of this year. And now they are encountering the German army's fresh forces. The enemy dreamed of opening a second front while the German army was trapped on the Eastern Front, forcing the German command to mobilize troops stationed in France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Norway, and other countries to rescue the Eastern Front. But in reality, these dreams have all come to nothing. The German forces in Western Europe have not been mobilized, and the most elite troops have been transferred to the Western area. Goebbels continued to describe Churchill's difficult situation, stating that there was absolutely no way to maintain his prestige. If he did not open a second front and the Soviet Union continued to collapse, political turmoil would occur in the country, and relations between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union would deteriorate. If he attacked the European continent, he would likely suffer a disastrous defeat, which would affect the entire war situation. For Britain and the United States to attack the European continent would be a mad act, with serious consequences for Britain and the United States. Germany welcomes Churchill and Roosevelt's attempts, as they have an adventurous character. The German command has prepared to deal with this adventure. The Allies have probably realized that they will be defeated on the Eastern Front and have no choice but to risk attacking the European continent. Germany and the people of the world will one day understand the truth about the propaganda regarding the attack on the European continent. Germany is prepared. If British and American troops attack the European continent, they will be completely annihilated. The German people will surely witness the day when British troops enter Berlin, but these British troops will not be conquerors but prisoners. The remnants of the British army will once again cross the English Channel from Dunkirk and retreat to Tipperary (Ireland).

### Soviet Military Delegation Flies Away from Cairo

### United States Begins Nationwide Scrap Metal Collection

Lisbon, 29th (Allied News Agency) – According to a Washington dispatch, Roosevelt hosted a group of journalists here at noon on the 29th, urging the nation to assist in the scrap metal collection campaign. It is said that the raw materials problem is serious in some respects. This shows one aspect of the United States' wartime material shortages.

Lisbon, 30th (Haitong News Agency) – President Roosevelt has announced a nationwide scrap metal collection campaign. The governor of Connecticut announced yesterday that the state would begin collecting on August 3rd, with each household expected to contribute 25 kilograms of scrap metal on the first day.

### War in the Egyptian Desert Zone Turns Quiet Again; Axis Aircraft Attack Cairo Yesterday

Lisbon, 30th (Allied News Agency) – General Rommel's Axis forces and General Auchinleck's Eighth Army each held their ground yesterday, and the land war on the Egyptian front entered a state of rest again. Apart from some activity by both sides in the southern part of the front, the air was also quiet. The result of this fierce battle was that a small area in the northern part of the Al-Alamain front returned to Axis hands, and the Italian army captured the Siwa Oasis. General Auchinleck's fierce offensive was used to set up landmines in areas well-defended by the German forces, in order to prevent the British air force’s efforts to concentrate its bombing of the main German transportation lines between Tobruk and Sidi Barrani. Although the attacks were somewhat successful, they failed to cut off the movement of German manpower and materials. On the North African coast, the British army also launched a fierce air raid on Tuesday.

Lisbon, 30th (Allied News Agency) – According to a Cairo dispatch, the British Middle East Command announced that Cairo was attacked by Axis aircraft early this morning, causing slight material damage. Air raid alerts were also issued in the Suez Canal Zone and several provinces in upper and lower Egypt.

Somewhere on the Egyptian border, 29th (Havas News Agency) – After fierce fighting on the Egyptian front from the 25th to the 27th, both sides have been limited to reconnaissance activities in the past two days. The British army once launched a fierce attack on German positions in the south, but was forced to retreat to its original positions and continued to fight in the area of the El-Alamein Heights for 24 hours. British Commander-in-Chief General Auchinleck does not seem willing to launch a large-scale offensive, but only wants to find weaknesses in the Axis defense line. Apart from this, another goal of the British offensive is to contain the Axis forces so that General Rommel cannot consolidate his positions, that is, he cannot prepare to launch another fierce attack on British positions. However, no armored units participated in the British offensive. At the beginning of the war, the British army clearly had the upper hand, but by the morning of the 27th, the German army began to counterattack. The British artillery then opened fire, covering the infantry's retreat to its original positions. Both sides' air forces participated in the battle. By night, the artillery fire stopped, and the desert area was able to return to a state of calm. This is also acknowledged by the British military, as the result of this offensive did not achieve General Auchinleck's expectations. However, due to the recent arrival of a large number of military equipment, especially giant American tanks, the British side is still very optimistic about the future of the war.

Lisbon, 29th (Allied News Agency) – According to a Cairo dispatch, the Suez Canal was bombed again by the Axis air force and was heavily damaged.

### German Aircraft Raid England Under Bright Moonlight

Lisbon, 30th (Allied News Agency) – According to a London dispatch, the German air force launched its first raid of the week on London and the Midlands this morning, dropping bombs under the bright moonlight. Some German aircraft flew to a city in the western Midlands, dropping incendiary bombs and causing violent explosions. There was also some German aircraft activity in East Anglia and the Northwest. The British Air Ministry announced that German aircraft were active in the Midlands and eastern counties of England, and the Birmingham area suffered slight damage, with a few dozen casualties.

Berlin, 30th (Haitong News Agency) – British aircraft dropped bombs in a certain part of western Germany, but the results of the air raid are not yet known here.

London, 29th (Havas News Agency) – There were rumors that the British and German air forces had agreed not to bomb each other's capitals. However, this was denied by the authorities here, saying that the rumor was completely unfounded.

Berlin, 30th (Havas News Agency) – A local radio station recently announced that the Eilendorf Hospital was completely destroyed during the British bombing of Hamburg the night before the war.

### United States Plans to Conclude Business Agreement with Iran

Washington, 29th (Havas News Agency) – Secretary of State Hull recently announced that the United States plans to conclude a business agreement with Iran.

### Shanghai Municipal Council to Form Economic Police Force to Supervise All Economic Activities to Improve Various Price Controls

The Shanghai Times reports that Japanese sources claimed yesterday (29th) that the Shanghai Municipal Council is studying a plan to organize a special economic police force to supervise all economic activities within the International Settlement. After the implementation of various economic control measures in various parts of the city, the need for such an economic police force has been deeply felt. The technical knowledge of the ordinary police force is insufficient to effectively supervise economic activities in accordance with the various regulations. If the plan to establish an economic police force in the International Settlement is realized, this group will be under the jurisdiction of the Police Department and will be a supporting part of the Police Department. Economic experts will be invited to control commodity prices, financial transactions, food distribution, and other similar measures. It is heard that police forces outside the International Settlement are also studying the possibility of establishing their own economic sub-units, as supervising economic activities is a heavy burden for regular police forces. According to well-informed sources, if the economic sub-unit of the Police Department is established, price controls will be greatly improved and the black market will be cracked down on. Special police officers can investigate store prices at any time.

### Yesterday's Scorching Heat in this City Exceeded 100 Degrees

Yesterday, this city was scorched by the sun all day long, and the entire city was like being in a furnace. According to the Observatory records, the highest temperature yesterday rose to 100.2 degrees (37.9 degrees Celsius), and the wind was calm, so the heat was even more unbearable. Whether working in the scorching sun or sitting indoors, people were sweating profusely. The highest temperature in Shanghai's summer was in 1934, when the temperature rose to 104 degrees. That year, there was a severe drought for more than 100 days, causing great damage to crops in the suburbs. The next year, 1935, the highest temperature also rose to 100.8 degrees. Since then, the highest temperature each year has not exceeded 100 degrees. This city has been sunny for half a month, and the heat has been extremely unusual every day, without any showers. Crops in the suburbs are in great need of water, and drawing water for irrigation is extremely laborious. In places where water supply is inconvenient, the rice and wheat have withered, and farmers wear worried expressions.

### Anonymous Extortion to be Severely Punished

The head of the Special Higher Criminal Division of the Police Department issued a statement, saying that recently, there have been reports in the alleyways of the International Settlement that Chinese detectives and fake detectives of the Police Department have used the names of Japanese police officers and cadres to extort money from citizens under the pretext that they are suspected of committing crimes, or illegally detain them. It is known that the above situations are not true. If these situations are found to be true, the authorities will express their regret. In any case, the police authorities will severely deal with these unscrupulous elements. If any citizen suffers losses or learns of crimes of this nature, they should immediately report the details to the nearest police station for handling.

### Notice from the Japanese Military Authority in This City - Citizens Must Obey Air Defense Regulations

From the Allied News Agency: In view of the importance of air defense in this city, the highest Japanese army and naval authorities in this city have adopted comprehensive air defense measures. The highest commander of the army and navy has issued a notice, and the army and navy garrison authorities have issued a statement, hoping that the general public will strictly abide by air defense regulations. The notice states: All citizens residing in Shanghai must fulfill the obligations to abide by all regulations related to civilian air defense stipulated by the relevant authorities. July 29, 1942. The highest commander of the army, the highest commander of the navy, and the army and navy garrison authorities issued a statement saying: Regarding air defense measures in Shanghai, in view of the importance of this city, the Japanese military authorities have taken comprehensive measures, and elite aviation units of the Japanese army have preemptively attacked enemy air bases and destroyed their air power. Therefore, to date, Shanghai has no danger of air raids, and citizens can live and work in peace. This is cause for great celebration. However, as the Greater East Asia War develops into a world war, considering the mobility of aircraft, it cannot be said that Shanghai is absolutely not a target for aerial guerrilla warfare. Therefore, regarding civilian air defense, we should always take a "prepared for the worst" approach and adopt foolproof countermeasures. Therefore, the highest commander of the army and navy has issued a notice to the citizens of Shanghai, imposing on them the obligation to strictly abide by all regulations related to civilian air defense stipulated by the relevant authorities. The Shanghai Garrison and the Shanghai Naval Special Landing Force, the former being the Shanghai Army Air Defense Headquarters and the latter being the Shanghai Navy Air Defense Headquarters, guide the municipal government, the Public Works Department, and the Japanese Consulate Police on civilian air defense matters. The municipal government, the Public Works Department, and the Japanese Consulate Police guide the general public in implementing air defense measures. It is hoped that all Shanghai citizens will strictly abide by the air defense regulations and instructions of the authorities in the future.

### Red Sun Overhead - Cold Drink Business Flourishing - Watermelons Too Expensive, People Can't Afford Them - Popsicles Offer a Momentary Relief from the Heat

It's the height of summer, with the red sun blazing overhead. The weather these past few days has been particularly scorching, with the temperature rising above 90 degrees Fahrenheit every day. As the saying goes, "heatstroke," and these days are indeed heatstroke-inducing. But it's the height of the hottest period of the year, and this is the time for heat. If it's not hot during this period, the crops won't ripen. If it weren't hot now, wouldn't that lead to famine?

During this scorching summer season, the most hardworking people are the farmers in the fields, toiling under the blazing sun. Next are the rickshaw pullers and the general working class in the city. They spend their days running under the scorching sun, sweating profusely. If they don't work for a day, they don't eat. Their money is earned with blood and sweat, enough to feed their families, which takes painstaking effort.

The hotter the weather during this period, the more welcome it is to cold drink merchants. They wish it would stay hot every day. Gradually the weather will turn cooler, so the hotter it is during the summer, the more prosperous the cold drink business becomes, and the prices can be sold higher. This summer, the cold drink business is particularly abnormally developed. This is because the price of watermelons is too high. Under this high-pressure living standard, watermelons cost over 100 yuan per load, which is equivalent to over 200 yuan in old currency. Everyone can't afford watermelons. Last year, each load sold for only 15 or 16 yuan, and vendors sold slices for 5 to 10 cents each. This year, each slice costs 3 jiao in reserve certificates. Compared, isn't that 7 or 8 times more expensive?

There are many types of cold drinks, such as ice essence, ice bricks, wooden dolls, imperial concubines, beauty brand popsicles, green treasure fresh orange juice, golden camel brand fresh orange juice, Zheng Guanghe soda, ice cream, shaved ice, sour plum soup, cool jelly, cold noodles from food stores, mung bean soup, lily soup, and dozens of others. But young people's cold drinks are also expensive. Although it is said that the price of all raw materials is high, and water and electricity costs have repeatedly increased, they are almost several times more expensive than last year. Last year, a beauty brand popsicle cost 1 jiao retail. This year it is 5 jiao in reserve certificates, a tenfold increase. This year's wholesale prices have also increased. For example, ice essence costs 5.5 yuan per dozen in new currency, wooden dolls and imperial concubines cost 9.9 yuan per dozen, and ice bricks cost 55 yuan per dozen. The retail price at the store is the wholesale price plus a profit of 10% to 20%. Ice essence costs 4 jiao in new currency per stick, wooden dolls and imperial concubines cost 1.3 yuan per stick, and ice bricks cost 6.5 to 7 yuan per box. As for Green Treasure fresh orange juice, the wholesale price is 19 to 20 yuan per dozen, so the retail price must also be 2.5 yuan per bottle. Golden Camel brand is 1.6 yuan per bottle, and Zheng Guanghe soda is 3 yuan per large bottle and 1 yuan per small bottle at retail. As for other cold drinks, they are also very expensive. A bowl of mung bean soup costs 1.5 yuan in reserve certificates. This is the minimum customers dare to order. If you go to a larger cold drink shop, it will cost no less than 5 or 10 yuan. When the weather is hot, the cold drink shops are full of customers, the electric fans are turned on full blast, and batches of people come like swarms of locusts. Everyone thinks it's a great place to cool off, and business is very prosperous. But how can the average citizen afford such expensive cold drinks? (To be continued)

### The Second Emergency Epidemic Hospital - A Savior for the Poor and Sick

When the cost of living is so high that it is difficult to solve the problem of three meals a day and a place to sleep at night, if you are unfortunate enough to get sick, asking for a doctor and taking medicine costs tens or hundreds of gold. It is difficult for people who rely on salaries to bear this, and even for ordinary people, it is impossible to maintain. This is an undeniable fact. If a poor person gets sick, then apart from relying on fate and nature, they can only wait for death. This is a social problem.

The New Pharmaceutical Industry Saves People from Suffering

Mr. Xu Xiaochu, Mr. Xu Guanqun, Mr. Yuan Hesong, Mr. Bao Guochang, Mr. Gao Peiliang, Mr. Yao Junzhi, and Mr. Zhou Mengbai of the Shanghai New Pharmaceutical Industry Association have always been very enthusiastic about social undertakings. In view of the pain of the poor and sick who have no money to seek medical treatment, they convened a meeting two years ago to establish the Shanghai Emergency Epidemic Hospital to provide medical treatment to the poor and sick and to provide emergency treatment for epidemics. Since its establishment, it has been through three sessions, and it treats no less than 100,000 patients every year.

The Internal Organization is Well-Ordered

The internal organization of the hospital is as follows: Mr. Xu Xiaochu is publicly elected as the chairman of the board of directors, and Mr. Xu Guanqun and Mr. Yu Zhixue are the vice-chairmen of the board of directors. The medical affairs are presided over by Dr. Tong Zhiqing, who graduated with a doctorate in medicine from Germany. Many medical masters who graduated from domestic and foreign medical universities are hired to be responsible for internal and external emergency and other departments. The administrative affairs are presided over by Gu Yuanchang. All the clerks have the spirit of working hard and diligently, following Chairman Xu in handling health undertakings for many years, and they all have rich experience.

Outpatient and Inpatient Services are Free of Charge

The purpose of the hospital is to provide relief to the poor and sick. Therefore, whether it is outpatient, inpatient, medical treatment, food and accommodation, everything is completely free of charge. It can be called the only completely free hospital in Shanghai. Patients who come for treatment do not need introductions from acquaintances, and the wards are not divided into grades. All who come are treated equally, which is particularly praised by society. Recently, the weather has been hot and stuffy, and the number of patients has increased sharply. Most of the patients in the hospital have seasonal illnesses, and they all need to be injected with physiological saline. According to the inspection results, there are already many cases of true cholera. The hospital beds are full, and most of them are poor people, which shows the pain of the poor and sick in society and the urgent need for a hospital with a truly charitable nature.

The Spirit of Service is Admirable

In order to assist the authorities in epidemic prevention, the hospital sends dedicated personnel to various organizations to administer group injections at the request of various groups. They work hard in the hot summer, regardless of fatigue, and provide voluntary services. The groups that have received injections include Wuzhou Pharmacy, Baili Bazaar, Shengsheng Ranch, and Xinya Materials Factory, among others, with a total of more than 6,000 people injected. In order to instill common sense in patients, public health nurses give lectures on health common sense and cholera prevention methods in the waiting area every day, using simple and clear language. As for the doctors and nurses, their sincere attitude and earnest service are indeed due to the good leadership of the hospital authorities.

The Expenditure on Medicines is Huge

The hospital's expenditure on medicines must be over 1,000 yuan per day, so just the medicine cost alone requires 30,000 yuan per month. The source of funds, in addition to the donations from the members of the new pharmaceutical industry, also includes voluntary donations from all walks of life, with no other income. It is hoped that all philanthropists will visit the hospital for on-site visits and guidance, and provide as much assistance as possible. The cause of serving the public cannot be maintained by the efforts of one person or one industry. It requires the assistance of the public to maintain it.

People from All Walks of Life Enthusiastically Support

People from all walks of life who have personally visited the hospital all express their utmost sympathy, or voluntarily donate generously, or tell their relatives and friends to do their best to provide spiritual and material assistance. The most touching story is that of a poor child named Huang who, after recovering from his illness and being discharged from the hospital, donated all 2.5 yuan he had begged to the hospital. The hospital receipt number is 438, which is indeed a very touching thing. The hospital assigns a female service worker to write letters and provide various services for patients who come to the hospital. It is hoped that all sectors of society will refer the poor and sick to the hospital for diagnosis and treatment, which will be a savior for the poor and sick, and the merits are immeasurable. The hospital address is 47A Daxilu, telephone number 12355.

### Gong and Shen Engagement

Yesterday (the 30th) was the engagement ceremony of Mr. Gong Qianren, the eldest son of Mr. Gong Zhuqin (Zhu Ting), a Shanghai gentleman, and Ms. Shen Zhenying, the fifth younger sister of Mr. Shen Zhenshui. The ceremony was held in the grand ballroom of the Atlantic Western Restaurant on Fuzhou Road. Mr. Majidi served as the witness. Many relatives and guests attended. It is reported that Mr. Qianren is currently studying at the Tongde Medical College, and Ms. Shen is studying at Huaying Girls' Middle School.

### Xu Yuechen Calligraphy and Painting Exhibition

Xu Yuechen from Luhe is skilled in calligraphy, poetry, prose, and seal carving. He has traveled to famous mountains and rivers and has extensively viewed wonders. Therefore, his poems, prose, and essays are clear and lofty. He can write quickly and write in various styles of calligraphy, all in the style of the ancients. He is detached and unsurpassed. His calligraphy is in the style of various masters of the Tang and Song dynasties. He is proficient in figures, landscapes, flowers, fruits, birds, animals, insects, and fish, all of which are divine. He is especially good at painting ladies. He recently held an exhibition of 300 of his recent works at the Daxin Company's fourth-floor book hall from the 30th of this month to the 5th of August. People in Shanghai should not miss this opportunity.

### Acknowledgements from This Newspaper

Commercial News

### Investment Awaits Opportunity - Stock Market Decline Is Still Slight

Yesterday's Shanghai Chinese stock market was increasingly stable. Investors were preparing to wait for an opportunity to pass through the bottom of July and then act. Those who held stock certificates were also unwilling to easily sell them cheaply, so although the various stocks still did not escape the fatigue of the past ten days, the decline was increasingly small. Only the Zhabei Water and Electricity stock fell more sharply, breaking into the 40 yuan range, down 1.5 yuan. New investors are still watching. Chinese energy has been stable for more than a week. Among the cultural stocks, only the China Book Company fell by 2.5 yuan. The Commercial Press and World stocks remained unchanged. Among the department stores, the New New Company rose by 0.5 yuan, and Wing On fell by 2 yuan. The price of the Innerwear stock was the same as the previous day. On the 40 yuan mark, there were many price-limited buyers. The Shanghai Woolen Mill also fell by 0.5 yuan. Among the new pharmaceutical stocks, the Sino-French stock retreated without advancing, and both it and the Xinya stock fell by 0.5 yuan, still seeking stability. The Daqin Huochai stock suddenly entered the 200 yuan range in a buying frenzy, up 7 yuan. The Nanyang Tobacco Company was unable to hold the 80 yuan mark for long and rebounded, rising for eight consecutive days, with a total increase of over 70 yuan. The Dasheng No. 2 Factory stock, which had risen by over 70 yuan, experienced a reversal after rebounding from the peak in the morning, with sellers selling off, down 7.5 yuan. Everything else was stable at over 270 yuan. As people's hearts are unsettled, there is unlikely to be any development this week, which has only two days left. It is possible that the capitalists will launch an offensive in the coming week, and the market price will then have a chance to recover. The stock price list is listed below.

### Public Debt Morale Increasingly Stable

Yesterday's over-the-counter public debt market continued to rise, and the trend was relatively strong. Due to the talk of raising another securities market, the scope of activity of the chips became increasingly wide, and it was even more clear that securities were not under control. People's hearts were greatly stabilized, and the market price gradually strengthened. Today is the end of July, and the 13th installment ticket is also due. It is said that most people still advocate that the interest tickets for the 12th and 13th installments should be included in the settlement. In this way, in the future, there will inevitably be different market prices for one or two installments of interest tickets. Yesterday, Tongli, Lianyi, Jiufeng, and Xinfeng continued to buy strongly. The market was more active, and as a result, except for the Wuchen stock, which was sold by Tongkang and did not rise or fall, the rest continued to rise by 2 and 5 jiao respectively. The transaction volume was approximately 1.8 million yuan. A brief table is listed below.

### Military Notes Show Little Change

Yesterday, the price of gold jewelry per tael quoted by the silver shop industry association was still 2,250 yuan (buying in at about 350 yuan). The interbank trading price fell slightly, down 20 yuan in the morning to 1,970 yuan. It then retreated another 20 yuan to 1,950 yuan in a selling spree. After a certain group intervened, it was slightly raised. The price at noon was 1,975 yuan, down 15 yuan from the previous day, with a difference of 250 yuan. The volume of transactions was still light. As for silver jewelry, the price per tael was still 16 yuan. The interbank trading price had fallen to 11.56 yuan.

Beans: Yesterday, due to quiet supply and demand, there were few transactions, and the market was weak.

Corn: Demand was relatively good, and the market continued to rise. Yesterday, 100 bags of Wuhu corn were opened at a price of 108 yuan.

Dried sweet potatoes: Arrivals were few and sales were active, and sellers were quite willing to sell. Yesterday, 60 bags of Jiangbei dried sweet potatoes were opened at a price of 108.5 yuan, up 0.5 yuan from before.

Wheat bran: Rural sales were considered expensive and turned weak, but sellers were not willing to loosen their prices too much, so the market hovered. Yesterday, 200 small bags of Sanxin wheat bran from May were opened at a price of 102.5 to 102 yuan.

Bean cake: Due to the drought affecting fertilization, sales were still weak, but sellers were still trying to hold on, and the situation tended to stabilize. It is estimated that 1,000 pieces of Xingji bean cake from April were opened at a price of 60.02 yuan.

### Soap, Candles, and Matches Show Different Trends

The soap market for daily necessities had strong sales, the match market showed weakness due to the continuous sale of cheap goods, the candle market rose and fell suddenly, and the market price lacked change. The price of Phoenix brand was 2,800 yuan, Meilu brand was 3,000 yuan, Jinding brand was 2,750 yuan, miscellaneous brands were 2,250 yuan, Huangxiangmao soap was 210 yuan, Baixiangmao soap was 250 yuan, Guben soap was 240 yuan, Scissors King soap was 281 yuan, Bai Li's foreign candles were 125 yuan, Sengqing brand was 120 yuan, and miscellaneous brands were 95 yuan.

### Cigarettes Show a Slight Uptrend

Generally, hoarders in the cigarette market see that the risk has not yet been eliminated, so they dare not take large quantities. However, the Japanese cigarettes still have a strong trend, probably because the spot goods are gradually becoming scarce, so the price is quite upward. The opening prices for yesterday were Big British brand 8,350 yuan, Old Knife brand 5,200 yuan, Pinhai brand 4,500 yuan, Wuhua brand 3,250 yuan, Fairy brand 3,700 yuan, Japanese cigarette Jinqiang brand 1,420 yuan, Jindalou brand 1,850 yuan, Hongmeigui brand 1,000 yuan, Quanlu brand 1,540 yuan, Nianzhu Quanlu brand 1,550 yuan, Zhinan brand 1,250 yuan, Guoyan Jinshu brand 1,500 yuan, Meili brand 2,600 yuan, and Jinzita brand 3,000 yuan. The trend is lively.

### Qingjiang New Vegetables - First Arrival of 22 Packages

New daylily vegetables have gradually appeared in various producing areas, but due to the difficulty in approximating prices, very few have been shipped to the Shanghai market. For the first batch of Xuzhou small-package vegetables, the traveling merchant’s counter-offer was still different. An electricity message has already been sent to Xuzhou for confirmation, and a response has not yet been obtained. Yesterday, the first batch of Qingjiang vegetables also arrived, totaling twenty-two packages. The asked price is similar to Xuzhou vegetables, but although the color is good, the quality is inferior. The traveling merchant’s counter-offer is a difference of twenty to thirty yuan to seek a deal.

### Sugar Stocks Settle Down

Yesterday, the sugar stock sheets of the Sugar Merchant Cooperative Business Office’s turned flat. There were slight fluctuations in tea. At the beginning of the market, the group sand stock association’s sheet opened at 304 yuan, saw 302 yuan midway, and ultimately closed at 304 yuan. The red sand stock opened at 293 yuan, down slightly by two yuan from the previous day (the 27th). A total of 1,500 bags were traded.

### Hawthorn Cake Postponed Arrival of Goods

Hawthorn cake is also one of the medicinal materials. The stock in Shanghai is very deficient. Yesterday, samples were sent in from the customer’s side. The quality is extremely dry. Traveling merchants valued it higher than hawthorn slices. The understanding is that a deal can hopefully be reached. Shipment to Shanghai for sale is hopefully imminent.

### Expectations for Students Applying for Scholarships

— Mo

The third group of students applying for scholarships from this newspaper will undergo a screening test within the next few days. The staff firmly believes that their test results will be satisfactory to the donors. However, it also requires the students to redouble their efforts.

The fundraising for this newspaper's scholarships is based purely on the trust and generosity of all sectors of society. Although the amount of donations in each session cannot be considered huge, it has achieved considerable success solely on the basis of the warm sympathy of all sectors of society. Therefore, the benevolence and righteousness of all sectors of society, the cultivation of good social customs, and the guidance of promising youth are far greater than the amount of scholarship money on the surface. The donors are truly worthy of the title "righteousness reaching the heavens."

The students are all excellent students. They are almost unable to attend school due to their poor family circumstances. The parents of the students, although lacking in resources, have urged the students to achieve this success and are blameless. The students apply for this newspaper's scholarship with these excellent grades. This is the honor of the students, and it is also the willingness of the staff of this newspaper to work hard to make a small contribution.

The students are happily taking the exam today, not only to solve the tuition problem, but also to represent the achievements of their parents and alma mater, as well as the achievements of this newspaper's scholarship program. We will use the outstanding achievements of the students to encourage the development of scholarship programs in the future, and to thank all sectors of society for their enthusiastic donations. Students, strive for it!

Some of the students may be graduating, while others are still in elementary school. Building up the mountain with one basket of earth and cultivating people for a century is the responsibility of society, and it is also what we should strive to advocate. It is hoped that after the students have completed their studies, they will live up to the expectations of the donors. Then, even if the staff braves the scorching heat and severe cold, travels around for investigation, sweats and freezes while organizing and auditing, the joy in their hearts will be enough to comfort society.

### The Responsibility of Students

— Tian Fuheng

A month before the start of summer vacation, Mr. Zhou told me about his classmates' plan to organize a summer tutoring school. It didn't materialize due to the lack of a suitable location, but they continued their efforts. Finally, school was out for summer vacation, and their opportunity came along. They worked separately, contacting people in all directions, especially a classmate named Mu who was most enthusiastic. He tirelessly ran around in this hot weather. As a result, they found a school site - the Peiyu Elementary School in Ziyang Lane, Wuding Road, which was named Zhenchuan Night School Summer Tutoring School. Although it is temporary, it is purely for social service. The funding is generously donated from various sources, and it is always their reward for their efforts! There are as many as sixteen teachers, all of whom are enthusiastic students. A total of 180 students were enrolled in this session. Although there were still applications afterwards, they had to decline due to the small classrooms. The classes are divided into elementary school lower, middle, high and junior high school first and second grades. The registration procedure is very simple, with a temporary deposit of two yuan. The fee will be refunded upon termination of the semester with the receipt. Elementary school books are distributed free of charge, and class time is set from 4:00 PM to 7:00 PM every afternoon. The main courses are Chinese, English, Arithmetic, Physics and Chemistry, etc., all of which are based on the students' level, so teaching does not feel difficult.

The success of this event was truly unexpected. After just a few days of negotiation, everything went smoothly and could be carried out. Classes officially started on the 15th of this month, which is thanks to Principal Wang of Peiyu Elementary School. This group of students who are benefiting children are high school students who are still studying; they have always studied diligently in school, and in view of the fact that school fees are currently too expensive, the number of children who have dropped out of school is increasing; therefore, they founded the tutoring school regardless of all the difficulties, although it does not accommodate many people, but the effect will not be absent!

Due to the rise in the cost of living, tuition fees have to rise accordingly, several times higher than last year, which will naturally make it difficult for the parents of general students to bear this huge amount of money. Although there are requests for loan assistance in various places, these are all pathways for excellent students, and they do not have any effect on students of ordinary qualifications. It is important to know that these unfortunate dropouts cannot be ignored even more. Because the most talented, after dropping out of school, they can still make their own decisions and will not be wasted, especially those who are unfortunately abandoned, they stand on the vast road and will not know what to do. If they are not saved, they will be conquered by the environment and finally go down the path of depravity. Even if we create a capable person to govern the world, it is still better to reduce a social waste! In view of this, we cannot but pay attention to progressive education, and it is difficult to achieve this in a university that seems to be designed exclusively for the children of wealthy families, so let's bear this responsibility!

If we can truly be enthusiastic in service, we may as well spare one or two hours of our free time every day to organize this type of volunteer school to save these dropouts! We also hope that ladies and gentlemen who are enthusiastic about charity in society will give us more convenience, so that those who are doing things will not be disappointed. Our actions are telling others and making others know that modern students are not all muddleheaded and only engaged in mixing qualifications and mixing diplomas. On the other hand, we also hope that all schools can do their best to lend classrooms to volunteer schools at the lowest rent, and please ask experienced educators to guide us from time to time. This is also a popular small teacher system. Its strength is to obtain greater results with less money, and to accomplish the cause of the masses with the power of the masses. Students! Take on this responsibility! So that those students who are standing and wandering outside the school gates can have more opportunities to study!

### Mr. Ding Fubao's Struggle with Tuberculosis

— Wu Xi

Ten years ago, because I was suffering from tuberculosis, I often learned about Mr. Ding Fubao from my uncle's mouth, and I learned about his struggle with tuberculosis when he was young, so I always had an image of an elder who had suffered from tuberculosis in my mind, and I had a strong desire to meet him. After the war, I finally achieved my wish, but I was so surprised that it was almost unbelievable that Mr. Ding had suffered from tuberculosis. His spirit was more full than that of young people, and he was radiant. After that, I received many teachings from the old gentleman, as well as many health preservation techniques, but his achievements were not accidental, but were fought from the bitter struggle. Now is the old gentleman's sixty-ninth birthday, and I will slightly write what I know to dedicate to the readers.

When Mr. Ding was young, he suffered from tuberculosis in his teens due to the poverty of his family and his congenital lack of strength. After having this terrible disease, not only did he not get proper treatment, but he also continued to study hard. One day when he was sixteen years old, he was diligently practicing calligraphy, and a fellow villager, Mr. Chen Zhongxing, sighed behind him and said: "You are about to die, what are you still practicing!" This shows the suspicion of his friends at the time. When he was in his thirties, he was still as weak as before, but he was not discouraged. On the one hand, he looked at life very open-mindedly, so-called one thought does not arise, one dust does not appear, purify the heart and eliminate the color, and cut off the knowledge to concentrate the spirit. These were all his old gentleman's motto at that time; on the other hand, he carefully studied hygiene and took himself as an example to fight hard with bacteria. His autobiography says: "I was often sick when I was young, and I paid attention to quiet recuperation. I have always adhered to the rules of hygiene in all aspects of diet and living. I began to become healthy at the age of twenty-eight." He also prefaced a book with the words: "The disease became more and more serious, so I cheered up and tried my best to resist the disease, changed the fierce to peace, changed the sadness to joy, and eliminated depression and annoyance. No matter what, I embraced optimism. As a result, my appetite increased day by day, and I was able to sleep soundly." This is a true record of his old gentleman's struggle.

Now, although he is old, his spirit is more vigorous and more invigorating, which is all caused by his indomitable courage. Now, in the midst of this great disaster, Mr. Ding resolutely takes it as his own responsibility to save young children from dropping out of school, and uses his birthday celebration for scholarship assistance and childcare. This shows how much Mr. Ding has worked hard.

The young people who are asking for scholarships must not lack the sick and weak. I hope they can refer to Mr. Ding's way of dealing with the world, and do not make the body and hard work go against each other. (In return for Mr. Ding's birthday celebration)

### A Letter to Loan Students

Dear friends:

I know that you have been burying your heads at home recently, diligently preparing for your exam, and I am the same as you. When the cruel heat wave is forcing people, I have overturned my books several times, but when I think of the gentlemen in the newspaper who are busy for us, they are also enduring the attack of the heat wave with us. An array of self-condemnation arose from the bottom of my heart, so we cheered up and studied hard. Friend, do you feel bitter? No, definitely not! I dare to guarantee that there is not a single person in our group who shouts bitter. We are not bitter, we only feel that we are happy, we have hope, although we are a little poor, but poverty is not a disease. It is precisely because of the gift of poverty that we have created a piece of rough jade that can be carved. Look, aren't our graduates all crowned before the first grade? Aren't our conducts all above B grade? We don't have the bad habit of vanity and luxury. What we are willing to do is work hard, what we are willing to eat is bitterness, and what we can do is labor. Where did all these come from? Friend, I know you will not hesitate to answer me like this: it is poverty! Ah, dear friend, since we understand it, we must be happy with poverty, not only now, but also forever. Poverty will make you a perfect person. Look, aren't the great men of all countries in the world all successful through struggle and poverty?

We don't blame our parents for not preparing a beautiful and wealthy family for us so that we can enjoy a life of pampering and pampering. Not only that, but when our parents are sweating for our food and clothing, our hot tears can't help but burst into tears. We only hate why our parents gave birth to us so late, otherwise, we can at least give them some spiritual and material comfort. Our age and knowledge are really too small!

Some classmates think that our loan is shameful, which is not surprising to them, because in their eyes, one hundred and several tens of dollars is not a big deal. At most, it is their allowance for one or two weeks, and our ordinary poor classmates are mixed in the same school with them, so it is no wonder they think it is shameful, but looking back at their grades is shameful.

Now let's talk about society. Most people say that this society is selfish and cold, but in our opinion, that is just a one-sided assertion. The loan is a microscope of society, friend! Please also examine it carefully, and you will see that someone is sweating in the middle of the day to handle the heavy and precise work of appealing, crediting, and examination for others. Some people even give us the money they have exchanged for their own blood and sweat, so that we can enjoy it as long as we have our own knowledge. Is this society selfish, is it cold? Friend, when you see this, I guarantee you will shout wildly and say: "Ah, society, you are so great, you have given me more courage!" At that time, I beg you to hold back, that is, please think again about why they want to do this, is it because there is a you, there is a me? If you really think so, then society is wrong, and you and I are even more wrong! Friend, tell you, they are not for you, nor are they for me, but they are for education, they want to make us a useful talent!

Finally, please don't forget the exhortation and hope when your teacher is stamping and filling out the score for you, how much they love us this group, and when they leave, they still tell us to work hard to find questions to ask. Ah, dear teachers, respectable gentlemen who handle the loan, and enthusiastic people in society, we can't thank you for anything at the moment. All we have here is the sincere salute of our group of people! Friend, do you think we should say that? It's over, we will be able to meet in the examination hall in a few days.

I wish you a good result on the list

Your classmate Ji Shang

### In the Same Boat Through Storms

— He Jia Zhi

(7) Lightning

Wei Cheng said: "This is not necessarily a bad idea, who are these people?" Mrs. Ye Er said, "I don't know who the opium smoker is. The cigarette smoker is still young, he is Cheng Bing." Wei Cheng clenched his fists tightly, gritted his teeth, and said, "He is Cheng Bing, where is he, is he on the boat?" Mrs. Ye Er said: "I am talking about the past, Wei Cheng, calm down, don't listen to me, you will get angry, that's not right." Wei Cheng said: "What was Cheng Bing like at that time?" Mrs. Ye Er said: "At that time, your mother had no choice, she sat down, and told them where they lived, what their surnames were, and who they came out with. Cheng Bing and another person were really enthusiastic at that time. They found a small bamboo pole in the cabin and temporarily put a piece of cloth on it. The cloth said: Miss Li of Gangbei Township is here, hoping that the Li family will come to inquire. The words may not be like this, but the meaning is always like this. The boat crew was allowed to hold this small flag in their hands for the people on the shore who were crowding around to see. It took about one or two hours, but no one asked. Cheng Bing said, Miss Li, don't worry, although we are strangers, you don't know me, and I don't know you, but suddenly we are separated from our family, and suddenly we will get on our boat. This is also the Buddhist saying of fate. I estimate that in a few minutes, the conference will be arranged on the shore for us to see. After we have seen the conference, if your family still can't find you, and you can't find your family, then our boat will send you back to the Li family's house in Gangbei Township, which is always the most appropriate. Your mother was very grateful to Cheng Bing, and said: Mr. Cheng, where are you from, and who is this old gentleman? Cheng Bing refused to say, and only said: You don't need to panic at all. One can know a person's good and evil at a glance. Do you think we are good people or bad people? After saying this, the conference came, and both of them and your mother were standing on the bow of the boat to watch the conference. How could your mother have any thoughts of watching the conference? She was looking at the people on the road. This conference lasted for two hours, but it was neither your uncle nor the brothers and sisters in the same village, but the sky was getting dark." (142)
