### US Army Department Issues Communiqué: Philippine Capital Falls; Mindanao Also Occupied by Japan

Manila, Kyodo News Agency dispatch: Manila, the capital of the Philippines, was completely occupied by Japanese forces at 2:00 PM on the 2nd.

Buenos Aires, Reuters telegram of the 3rd: The US Army Department issued a communiqué stating that American and Philippine troops have withdrawn from Manila. Japanese forces have now entered the city, and the American defenses in Manila have been completely evacuated. They are now assembled near the coastal batteries of Manila Bay to prevent Japanese forces from utilizing the port facilities. Over the past two days, Japanese forces have attacked from the north, resulting in fierce fighting. The first troops to enter Manila were military police and other scouts to maintain the city's security and order. The reason for the American withdrawal is explained as a strategic move to enhance the defense of the north. Simultaneously, the US Navy Department announced that it has withdrawn from Cavite, ten miles from Manila. The American withdrawal from Cavite occurred before the Japanese occupation of Manila, and all military supplies and troops in Cavite have been moved, it is said.

Tokyo, Reuters telegram of the 4th: The Japanese Army Headquarters in Luzon issued a war report stating that when Japanese forces attacked Manila at 11:00 AM on the 2nd of this month, they encountered heavy artillery fire but finally broke through Manila's defense line and entered the city. Before the American forces withdrew from the city, they set it on fire, and thick smoke filled the air, preventing Japanese aircraft from detecting the situation when Japanese forces entered the city. At that time, Japanese forces attacked the city simultaneously from the north and southwest. Whether any American forces were captured is currently unknown.

Bangkok, Reuters dispatch of the 3rd: Japanese forces have now entered Manila, only twenty-six days since the outbreak of the Pacific War. Manila is the capital of the Philippine Islands, with a population of approximately 650,000. It is also the Philippine's most suitable seaport for foreign navigation, with various defense facilities and a commercial center, most notably for hemp and leather industries. In addition, there are many machine shops and factories. The naval base of Cavite is located at the entrance of Manila Bay, about 40 kilometers away, and has a very powerful wireless radio station. The Port of Manila has many defensive works, one of which is Corregidor Battery, which has been repeatedly bombed by Japanese aircraft, it is said.

Tokyo, Reuters dispatch of the 4th: The "Kochi Times" of Japan reported last night that Mindanao, the second largest island in the Philippines, has now been completely occupied by Japanese forces. Guerrilla warfare on the island may continue for some time, but it will not be effective in resisting, it is said.

Buenos Aires, Kyodo News Agency dispatch of the 4th: According to authoritative sources in Washington, the US government has decided that if the US Far East forces fail, the Philippine government will be relocated to Washington. It is heard that the necessary steps for the relocation of the capital are underway.

Washington, Havas dispatch of the 3rd: There has been no news here regarding the whereabouts of General MacArthur, Commander of the US Far East Forces. However, MacArthur may not adopt guerrilla warfare tactics but will lead his troops to continue fighting in the deep mountains and marshlands of Luzon to contain the Japanese forces.

Stockholm, Kyodo News Agency dispatch of the 4th: According to news from New York received here today, Washington announced that Corregidor Island Battery at the mouth of Manila Bay was bombed by sixty Japanese aircraft for one hour yesterday. It is reported that General MacArthur, Commander of the US Far East Forces, has retreated to this battery.

Tokyo, Reuters dispatch of the 3rd: After occupying Manila, Japanese army and naval forces have now concentrated their firepower to attack the fortress of Corregidor Island. It is reported that the island is located at the entrance of Manila Bay. After the American forces withdrew from Manila, American transport ships attempted to leave the port for other destinations but were repeatedly bombed by Japanese aircraft, resulting in many casualties.

Washington, Havas dispatch of the 3rd: After the fall of Manila, although there is no news here regarding the US Far East Forces' future combat plans, some observers believe that General MacArthur's remnants should try to defend Corregidor Island and the two small islands of Grande and Fraile. It is noted that Manila fell eighteen days after the Japanese forces landed on Luzon. Naval figures here also acknowledge the strategic value of Manila and Cavite naval ports, stating that the latter is the US's frontline submarine base in the China Sea area. The US military authorities originally had high expectations for submarine warfare, intending to disrupt Japanese transportation, but now that Cavite Port has fallen, US submarines must rely on more distant bases, which will be inconvenient for combat. For example, the US can switch to Olongapo Port, fifty miles northwest of Manila, as it is still in American hands. However, as the port is vulnerable to Japanese air raids and the main force of the US Navy has withdrawn from the sea off Luzon, it is doubtful whether the US forces are willing to use it.

Tokyo, Kyodo News Agency dispatch of the 4th: The Japanese Imperial Headquarters Naval Department announced today that the comprehensive results of the Japanese Navy in the Philippines to date are as follows: "103 enemy aircraft shot down (including 15 large aircraft and 4 airships), 257 enemy aircraft destroyed (including 22 large and medium-sized airships), 4 destroyers, 7 submarines, and 5 ships sunk; 1 special service ship and 30 ships damaged; 1 destroyer slightly damaged; 2 small patrol boats and 4 ships."

Tokyo, Reuters dispatch of the 1st: The Japanese Imperial Headquarters Army Department announced today that the city of Kuantan on the east coast of the Malay Peninsula was occupied by Japanese forces yesterday.

### British Trade Union Secretary Urges Compatriots Not to Underestimate Germany's Potential

Liverpool, Havas telegram of the 3rd: Mr. Citrine, Secretary-General of the British Trade Union Congress, delivered a speech today at a reception for a Soviet labor delegation, strongly arguing that Britain should not underestimate Germany's strength. He stated, "There are some people who believe that Germany is already at its wit's end, but I do not share this view, as such illusions may lead our countrymen to underestimate the enemy. We should have prepared in a timely manner in the Far East, but due to underestimating the enemy, we were caught off guard when the events occurred. It should be known that Germany has hidden trump cards up its sleeve, which we have long anticipated, and will soon regain its strength and launch an offensive. Therefore, all members of our Trade Union Congress have been mobilized to participate in various tasks, exerting all their intelligence and physical strength to fulfill our promises to the Soviet people. If employers can deeply understand the importance of labor-management cooperation, they will surely achieve good results. Therefore, our country's urgent task is to ensure that all employers understand this and hope that employers can always maintain close contact with labor."

### Rumors that British Ambassador Attended Meetings in the Soviet Capital

Ankara, Reuters dispatch of the 1st: Since the British side confirmed that the British Ambassador to Turkey, Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen, had indeed participated in the Stalin-Eden talks held in Moscow after attending the Cairo Conference, political and journalistic circles here have expressed surprise. Knatchbull-Hugessen's participation in such meetings is sufficient to indicate that the discussions between Stalin and Eden were not limited to European issues. Matters directly related to Turkey's interests must have been on the agenda, such as the issue of the Dardanelles, as the Soviet Union has repeatedly requested the right to use the straits. For this reason, people in the Turkish capital harbor a sense of distrust towards these meetings, and the fact that British propaganda deliberately concealed the news of Knatchbull-Hugessen's participation in the meetings has further increased suspicion.

### Establishment of Allied Unified Command in the Southwest Pacific; General Wavell as Commander-in-Chief, Brett as Deputy; Helfrich as Commander of Allied Fleets

Washington, Havas dispatch of the 3rd: Regarding the unified operations of the Allied nations, the White House Presidential Palace recently issued a communiqué stating that after the Joint Chiefs of Staff of the United States and the United Kingdom made recommendations to British Prime Minister Churchill and President Roosevelt, it has been decided to establish a unified Allied command in the Southwest Pacific. This decision has also been approved by the Dutch East Indies and the relevant autonomous authorities of the United Kingdom. All naval, land, and air forces in this theater of war (including Singapore, Malaya, the Dutch East Indies, and the Philippines) will be under the command of the Commander-in-Chief of the Allied Forces in the Southwest Pacific. After discussion between Churchill and Roosevelt and with the agreement of all parties, it was decided that General Wavell, Commander-in-Chief of the British Indian Army, will assume the position. Major General Brett, Chief of Staff of the US Air Force, has been appointed as Deputy Commander of the Allied Forces to assist General Wavell, and Admiral Helfrich, Commander of the US Asiatic Fleet, has been appointed as Commander of the Allied Fleets in the Southwest Pacific, subject to the control of General Wavell. General Pownall, Commander-in-Chief of the British Far East Forces, has been appointed as Chief of Staff of the Allied Forces to assist General Wavell. General Wavell will assume office within days. General Chiang Kai-shek of China has agreed to serve as Commander-in-Chief of the land and air forces in the China Theater, which includes Vietnam and Thailand, as these two areas may one day be approached by Allied forces. The United States and the United Kingdom will also dispatch representatives to be subordinate to General Chiang's headquarters.

Washington, Havas dispatch of the 2nd: British Prime Minister Churchill returned here from Ottawa at 8:55 AM yesterday and immediately went to the White House to hold talks with President Roosevelt. The main issue discussed was the war production plan. As a result of the discussion, it was decided that half of the United States' national income would be used for war production. As for the meeting held yesterday by Roosevelt and Churchill and military experts from the United States and the United Kingdom, the status of the Latin American republics in the current war was discussed. This can be seen from the fact that Secretary of State Hull and Under Secretary of State Welles both participated in this meeting. It is reported that Under Secretary of State Welles is scheduled to depart for the capital of Brazil within days to attend the Pan-American Conference on the 15th of this month. In addition, British Prime Minister Churchill will report to the American army and naval experts on his trip to Canada and the situation of close cooperation between the United Kingdom and Canada. In short, the purpose of the Anglo-American meetings is to adjust the Allied powers' war efforts and establish a common war plan.

Washington, Havas dispatch of the 1st: According to "Foreign Affairs Communications," as a result of a recent meeting of representatives of various democratic nations, it has been decided that issues concerning the Far East situation will be decided by the US government in consultation with the British side, and issues concerning the European situation will be decided by the British government in consultation with the Soviet government. The various occupied countries of Europe are holding meetings in London, but the Netherlands, due to its interests in the Pacific, will participate in the meetings in Washington. The principle of close cooperation between the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union seems to have been established by the previous talks in Moscow, but it is not believed here that this cooperative relationship will have any impact on the existing neutrality treaty between Japan and the Soviet Union. In short, all agreements already agreed upon by the relevant countries must be implemented through joint military and economic action, and it is believed that ultimate victory can be assured.

At the same time, all signatory nations emphatically declare that any nation materially participating in or preparing to participate in the effort in the war to "defeat Hitlerism" may join this agreement. In addition, all signatory nations have also established a common plan to move towards the same goal and abide by the same principles stipulated in the "Atlantic Charter" in order to "counteract" the violence of nations seeking to conquer the world.

Changsha - According to a special correspondent, Tom Sue Fo reporting for Reuters, the foreign press was invited by the Japanese military intelligence department to fly to Changsha for a second time.

Changsha is a critical strategic point, and in September of last year, Japanese forces occupied it once but then voluntarily retreated. It was not until December 24th of the previous month that they launched another offensive and reoccupied it after advancing 130 kilometers. Looking down from the plane onto Changsha, the entire city was desolate, and the majority of houses had been completely destroyed and one could see a fire burning.

### Safe Deposit Boxes in Foreign Banks to be Opened

Objects in Boxes to be Retrieved According to Application System

Foreign and Chinese banks in this city will reopen at 10:00 AM today after being closed for three days during the New Year holidays. After this reopening, major unresolved issues from the end of last year, such as salary payments and the opening of safe deposit boxes, are expected to be resolved satisfactorily soon. Regarding the opening of safe deposit boxes, a responsible person from Chase Bank told reporters that safe deposit box holders are expected to be allowed to retrieve items from their boxes at the beginning of this month. The retrieval method will likely follow an application system, where each safe deposit box renter will first describe the nature of the items they wish to retrieve and then apply to the bank for retrieval. They believe that if the items to be retrieved are contracts, notes, etc., their application will not be rejected. Furthermore, the Shanghai Municipal Council (SMC) has already notified banks to honor checks from American, Belgian, British, and Dutch banks, as well as the Central Bank of China, Bank of China, Communications Bank, and Agricultural Bank of China, if they are issued for paying taxes to the SMC or for services provided by the four major public utility companies. It is heard that HSBC will implement this measure after closing its accounts. It is not yet certain whether other foreign banks will follow suit.

### Rice Supply Still Not Smooth, Restrictions May Be Eased

Flour Price Limit Has Been Increased, Refusal to Sell is Unforgivable

This city has now passed the most severe stage of the procedure for using stored grain sparingly. In the future, the two settlements (International and French Concessions) may gradually relax restrictions, and there will be few new restrictions implemented. The first phase of actions taken by the authorities of the two settlements has been successful. Problems still exist in the future, but this is not due to inappropriate measures by the settlement authorities, but rather the failure of various merchants to cooperate sincerely. According to an SMC official, the refusal of retailers to sell flour is unforgivable, as the SMC recently announced a slight increase in the flour price limit, precisely to make it easier for flour shops to profit. Furthermore, if shops run out of stock, they only need to apply to the authorities of the two settlements to purchase an appropriate amount of flour from designated locations. It is also said that the supply of flour for making noodles in this city is very sufficient.

Two Offices Resume Work After Holiday

The SMC's Rice and Flour Offices resumed work on the 3rd, issuing transportation permits. The total amount of rice designated to be released from the China Warehouse, Kangfu Warehouse, and Maotai Warehouse was only over 2,000 bags. The amount of flour allocated by the Flour Office was also only a few hundred bags. Yesterday, Sunday, the office was closed. Today, applications for payment and endorsements are being processed as usual.

Warehouses Continue to Release Rice During New Year

The foreign rice signed out on December 31st last year from the China Warehouse was not released in time due to insufficient daily release. Extraction began on the 3rd. The rice shops that applied to the SMC and received foreign rice continued to sell in retail from January 1st to 3rd, but the number of rice buyers remained extremely crowded, making it difficult for those at the back to purchase.

Retail Crowds Have Not Diminished Slightly

Yesterday, Sunday, the SMC stipulated that rice sales would be suspended, so all rice shops were closed. However, in front of several rice shops, civilians lined up in the freezing wind from early morning. After learning the reason for the suspension, they all reluctantly returned. In front of the noodle shops, there were also long lines of civilians every morning, indicating that the food supply has not yet been greatly improved.

### SMC Advises Residents to Return to Their Hometowns as Soon as Possible

In Order to Adapt to the Current Economic Situation and Prevent the Continued Rise in Prices in Shanghai

According to the SMC's announcement, "In order to prevent the continued rise in prices and to adapt to the current economic situation, the Japanese authorities and this Bureau have decided, after consultation, to urge Chinese residents of the International Settlement, who do not absolutely need to stay, to return to their hometowns as soon as possible for the sake of the welfare and order of the International Settlement. The Japanese authorities will issue an emergency notice from the Supreme Commander of the Japanese Army and Navy in the Shanghai area, and the spokespersons of the Japanese Army and Navy will declare that Chinese residents who are willing to leave this city and return to their hometowns will be allowed to carry considerable luggage and personal belongings without any restrictions, nor will they need to apply for permits. However, those who wish to apply for return permits may apply to this Bureau or the Japanese Consulate General at 106 Huangpu Road for verification and issuance. Applicants to this Bureau may submit their applications to the Headquarters of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps at 180 Fuzhou Road."

### Pressure on Chinese and Foreign Merchants is Prohibited

The Japanese Consul General in Shanghai has recently warned the Japanese not to exert pressure on Chinese and foreign business circles for illegal purposes. It is said that the proclamation issued by the Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese Army and Navy in Shanghai on New Year's Eve regarding the protection of Shanghai residents also applies to the Japanese. The proclamation strictly prohibits impersonating Japanese officials and issuing threats and promises to punish violators severely.

### Procedures for Resolving Rent Disputes

The SMC announced, "If any tenant has a grievance against a landlord, or if any landlord has a dispute with a tenant, and if the property in question is located within the International Settlement, they may submit a written complaint to the Mediation Committee of the Legal Department of this Bureau at 239 Hankou Road, along with a fee equal to one-tenth of the monthly rent, but not less than 20 yuan in national currency. The committee will then send the received complaint to the other party, ordering them to reply in writing within three days of receipt. Then, based on the circumstances presented by both parties and the reply, it will consider and judge, or, if deemed necessary, convene both parties for further inquiry, striving for fairness to the greatest extent possible. The committee may formulate and implement its own rules regarding investigation and proceedings."

### Arrest of Highway Robbers, Busting of Robber Den, Large Number of Criminals Arrested, Multiple Firearms Confiscated

Liu Fengchun, a 57-year-old man from Shaoxing, lived at 43 Robert Street, West Shanghai, where he opened a Liufengji cloth-soled shoe store. Around 2:00 PM on the 2nd, while passing through the Ningbo Road intersection of the Eight-Li Bridge Street in the French Concession, he purchased a pair of used cloth shoes from a secondhand stall, intending to repair them. Suddenly, two bandits stopped Liu and

Searched and Robbed him

Hearing his loud cries for help, a patrol of the French Concession Police Force, consisting of Inspector Qin Youyu, Detectives Dai Rongji, Zhang Dongcheng, Zhou Qingfang, and Chen Fusheng, rushed to the scene and apprehended the two bandits on the spot. According to their confessions, one was Liang Yinghong, a 22-year-old man from Anhui, from whose pocket was confiscated a six-inch new-style pistol and five bullets. The other was Shen Zhiyu, a 24-year-old man from Anhui. There was also a bicycle, number 1102. They also

Implicated Accomplices

Li Jinshan was arrested at Room 217, Xindu Apartment, Foch Road, according to their confession. Furthermore, Yu Jiaohua (25 years old) was arrested at 6 Renmei Lane, Eight-Li Bridge Street. A four-inch pistol, four bullets, and a Mauser pistol with seven bullets were found in his home. His brother, named Wenfa, used to be a detective in the French Concession, badge number 523, but was dismissed for an incident and is still at large. Another bandit named Jiang Guangming, 24 years old, from Anhui, confessed to

Hiding in West Shanghai

at 213 Nanping Civil Village, Xuzhen Road. Another bandit, Huang Shouyu, 28 years old, from Anhui, confessed that bandits were staying at Room 16, Yiding Hotel, Yidingpan Road. Wang Zhihong is at large. Chen Jinfeng (25 years old), Shen Jinbiao (22 years old), and Huang Xianchu (23 years old) were subsequently arrested. Proceeding to 225 Zimin Village, Hongqiao Road, the arrested bandits, all from Anhui, confessed that at 7:00 PM on December 26th last year, they robbed Yao Ji, who runs the Chun Yuan Inn at 111 Lane, No. 1 Eight-Li Bridge Street, of clothing, cash, and other valuables worth 2,000 yuan. They also confessed that there are over 100 accomplices from Anhui, scattered in secluded places, ambushing and robbing passersby.

Over Two Hundred Frozen Corpses on New Year's Eve and New Year's Day

On New Year's Eve, there were 113 frozen corpses found on the streets of the two settlements. On New Year's Day night, there were 38 adult corpses and 34 child corpses in the International Settlement. On the same night, there were 58 corpses in the French Concession.

### American Relief Committee for Civilians: Temporary Cafeteria Has Opened, Issuing Meal Tickets and Guaranteeing American Registration

The newly established American Relief Committee for Civilians opened a temporary American cafeteria in the central district of this city on the 3rd. It has already provided food to approximately 30 Americans, mostly Filipinos. At the same time, the committee urged the American community in Shanghai to assist by immediately registering their needs at the committee's office on the 8th floor of the Dalai Building, 51 Guangdong Road. According to the committee members, they are planning to establish a

Food Distribution

permanent center in the Two Schools school building in the near future to accommodate impoverished expatriates. The American community has been slow to respond to the committee's call for immediate registration, which has hindered the committee's work in this area. Now, for the future well-being of the American community in Shanghai, the committee strongly urges Americans to register as soon as possible, regardless of their economic situation, so that the committee can know how to start solving the relief problem and formulate a concrete plan. The exact number of impoverished Americans, both present and future, needs to be accurately determined, so

Full Registration

of Americans is imperative. The temporary cafeteria set up in the central district aims to provide meals to Americans in dire need. Those who wish to dine there must first obtain meal tickets from the committee and inquire about the cafeteria's address. As of the 3rd, 30 meal tickets have been issued, and it is expected that the number of meal ticket applicants will increase significantly in the coming week.

The Thai Wu Shi Bao reports that Filipino expatriates in Shanghai are holding a meeting at the Metropolitan Ballroom on Gordon Road at 9:00 AM this morning (the 4th) to organize a federation and elect officers in order to promote their own welfare in the emergency situation. The Japanese Military Police in the Shanghai area have allowed the Filipino expatriates to hold this meeting. It is heard that the meeting will discuss the

Occupation and Accommodation

of distressed Filipino expats. According to preliminary investigations by the temporary committee, it is estimated that approximately 400 Filipino expats in Shanghai have lost their jobs in the past few weeks. A person in charge stated that they will cooperate with the Japanese authorities to carry out a plan to relieve these expatriates.

### New Year's Holidays Over, French Concession Still on Alert

The police authorities of the two settlements implemented joint security measures from New Year's Day to maintain security within the settlements. The French Concession temporarily blocked unnecessary road entrances at the settlement boundary with barbed wire, opening only one side of the sidewalk for pedestrians to pass through. Vehicles had to travel through the main boundary roads. There were no changes on the roads at the border between the two settlements. Although the New Year holidays are over, the French Concession authorities have not removed these security measures due to the ongoing winter defense period, and have dispatched small teams of police officers to patrol the main roads within the concession to maintain public peace. The International Settlement has returned to its original state, and vehicles and pedestrians can freely enter and exit.

### Entertainment Venues Plan to Operate with Candles

According to the SMC announcement, all entertainment venues must close before 10:00 PM every night starting from the 2nd of this month. However, this measure has a significant impact on the business of various entertainment venues. Therefore, some general associations plan to switch to candles after 10:00 PM every night to continue operating and avoid a major economic blow. According to an SMC official, the authorities are unlikely to approve this measure for many reasons. First, entertainment venues that sell alcoholic beverages are prone to fires if they widely use candles, as alcohol is flammable. Second, switching to candles after 10:00 PM may not waste electricity, but the consumption of candles will be enormous. Third, in addition to lighting, maintaining the operation of entertainment venues requires the supply of food and hot water kettles. If they continue to operate after 10:00 PM every night, the coal used for cooking food and boiling water will still not be reduced. The official also said that today's Shanghai must strictly distinguish between luxury and necessity. In order to protect necessities and resist luxury, it is natural for entertainment venues to close at 10:00 PM. Any compromise is inappropriate.

### SMC Health Director Advocates Communal Dining System for Lane Residents

Life is Different Now Than in Times of Peace, Coal and Electricity Should be Conserved as Much as Possible

Qiao Dan, the SMC Health Director, expressed his desire for Shanghai to establish a communal dining system when discussing civilian meals. It is said that all waste must now be avoided, and the consumption of coal should be strictly conserved. However, citizens in wartime cannot expect the life they had in times of peace. Other countries have tried a communal dining system, so he hopes that Shanghai citizens will also work together to avoid waste of fuel and food. Many lanes in Shanghai are suitable for implementing this system. Residents of each lane can separately discuss and agree with their neighbors to have one of the most suitable families cook food for two or three families to conserve fuel. Those who use electricity or gas for cooking should notify the electricity company or the gas company to avoid exceeding the limit of electricity or gas used and being penalized. Regarding this point, he intends to ask the electricity company whether it agrees with this power-saving plan. Qiao Dan further stated that he is not an expert in household affairs, but he feels that those with practical experience in city living can formulate a more applicable plan to cope with the current situation.

Office Hours of Various Post Offices

Effective January 5th of this month, the office hours of the various post offices in this city will be changed to the following times:

### Last Night's Robbery on Xinzha Road: One Bandit Killed, Owner Called Police as Robbers Tried to Flee, Police-Bandit Fight Injured Three Bystanders

Last night at approximately 7:30 PM, five robbers broke into a residence on Xinzha Road in the Public Concession. Their attempted robbery failed. The owner pursued them to the intersection of Seymour Road and Jing'an Temple Road. A White Russian police officer bravely confronted them. The bandits opened fire to resist arrest. The officer returned fire. A shootout ensued, with approximately 23 shots fired. One robber was killed, and three bystanders (male and female) were injured by stray bullets. The detailed account is as follows:

False Pretense to Escape

At approximately 7:35 PM last night, a certain Mr. Surname's residence at No. 17, Lane 944, Xinzha Road, was just finishing dinner when five robbers suddenly arrived. Two of them were armed. They barged into the house under the pretext of asking questions, intimidating the family and attempting to rob them. When the owner refused to comply and shouted for help, the robbers realized their situation was dire and turned to flee, with the owner in hot pursuit.

Police-Bandit Shootout

Upon reaching the lane entrance, they reported the situation to a patrol officer who immediately joined the chase. As they crossed Seymour Road to the intersection of Jing'an Temple Road, a White Russian auxiliary police officer happened to be patrolling. Seeing this opportunity, they shouted, "Robbers!" The bandits, realizing they had been exposed, ran swiftly. The White Russian officer bravely pursued them. In desperation, the bandits preemptively opened fire to resist arrest. The officer returned fire, resulting in a shootout with approximately 23 shots fired.

One Bandit Dead

Bullets flew everywhere, the sounds of gunfire crackling like firecrackers. A robber wearing a blue Western-style suit was shot in the head and died on the spot. A Mauser pistol with seven bullets was found next to him. He appeared to be around 30 years old, wearing black leather shoes and a gray gabardine coat.

Bystanders Injured

Simultaneously, stray bullets injured three pedestrians (male and female). They were: a young woman surnamed Zou, 21 years old, a local resident living at a certain address on Nanyang Road, Seymour Road, was wounded in her right breast and buttocks, with profuse bleeding. Her injuries were considered minor. Cai Qiu, 20 years old, a local resident working as a delivery man at a Cantonese sauce shop at No. 306 Seymour Road, was shot in the waist and legs. Another individual, Wang Mulong, 29 years old, from Chongming, a painter, was shot through the back and collapsed. Nearby officers, hearing the gunfire, rushed to the scene and summoned ambulances to transport the deceased robber and the three injured individuals to Baolong Hospital. The remaining robbers managed to escape.

### New Year Grand Steeplechase Tickets

Due to Printing Limitations, Only 30,000 Tickets Available - First Prize Could Reach Over 110,000 Yuan

The Shanghai Race Club's New Year Grand Races, held for three consecutive days from New Year's Day, were quite successful. The most important race, the New Year Grand Steeplechase, is scheduled to be held on Saturday, the 10th of this month (the fourth day of the New Year Grand Races). Sales of the New Year Grand Steeplechase tickets are also progressing rapidly, with over 10,000 tickets already sold. Due to printing limitations, the club only has 30,000 tickets available. Therefore, more than half of the tickets have already been sold. It is anticipated that the remaining 10,000 tickets will be sold out soon. If all 30,000 tickets are sold, the first prize could reach over 117,600 yuan. Each full ticket, consisting of eleven shares, is sold for ten yuan, with individual shares available for one yuan each. Those interested in purchasing tickets can visit the drawing department of the club at No. 304, Ma Hall Road.

### Comedian Lu Qiqi Passes Away

The famous comedian Lu Qiqi, 42 years old, from Suzhou, had been performing comedy with his elder brother Lu Xixi for over a decade and was highly respected. Lu was known for his amiability and dedication to public welfare, always participating in charity events. This spring, due to the high cost of opium, he attempted to quit his addiction at Yongchuan Hospital. However, due to his weak constitution, he left the hospital prematurely and recuperated at home, with his close friends providing for his daily needs. Unfortunately, his condition was beyond recovery, and he passed away on the midnight of January 1st. His friend Mr. Xu Zhuodai and others sent him to Shangtian Funeral Home for burial. The entertainment world has lost a renowned comedian.

### Shanghai Municipal Council to Establish Relief Committee for the Poor, Starting with Food Aid to the Salvation Army

The Shanghai Municipal Council is currently planning to establish a relief committee for the poor to assist the countless impoverished residents of the city. It is reported that the authorities are planning to conduct a survey of the number of poor people in the city and are considering ways to provide food.

Charitable Organizations Express Gratitude

It has also been learned that an official from a charitable organization expressed gratitude for the Shanghai Municipal Council's involvement in poverty relief. He stated that thousands of impoverished residents in the city rely on charitable organizations for survival and desperately need the council's assistance. The official noted that without the support of the concession authorities, charitable organizations would struggle to maintain their operations for long. The lack of funds, the closure of warehouses, and the insecurity caused by the disruption of import shipping have made relief efforts impossible. Colonel Walker, leader of the Salvation Army, told reporters that the Salvation Army's work is facing numerous difficulties. The mobile soup kitchen has been suspended due to a shortage of rice. The Salvation Army's soup kitchen in Hongkou is only able to operate using broken wheat. The beggar shelter in Singapore recently admitted 15 more beggars, but with so many beggars on the streets, 15 is woefully inadequate.

Dire Situation of Corpses Found in the Streets

Walker further noted that over 934 corpses were found in the streets of the concessions last week, and the actual situation is even more dire than that figure suggests. Most of these corpses were not victims of freezing or starvation but were abandoned on the streets by relatives or friends unwilling to bury them. This is especially common among children, indicating the extremely difficult living conditions of the lower classes. Charitable organizations are overwhelmed by this situation and pessimistic about the future. However, if the Shanghai Municipal Council can immediately provide large-scale relief efforts, the crisis situation can be alleviated. At the same time, a spokesperson for the Shanghai Municipal Council announced that once the council's poverty relief committee is established, it will first provide food to the Salvation Army for use in providing white rice. The spokesperson also stated that the Shanghai Municipal Council will handle the city's poverty relief efforts independently.

### Records of the Rong Wu Sutra Study Society

29th Session: The 19th lecture of the Rong Wu Sutra Study Society, the second session of the Sinology Lectures, was originally scheduled to be given by Mrs. Yao on the Classic of Filial Piety. Mrs. Yao arrived slightly late, so Mr. Yang Zhongyi first lectured on the changes and applications of the character "一" (one) in the Explanation of Writing. He said that the Explanation of Writing has fourteen chapters and 540 sections, and the characters begin with "一", saying that "the Way is established in 'one', creating and dividing heaven and earth, the Supreme Ultimate." Many Confucian scholars of the Qing Dynasty follow Xu Xuan and make "the Great Beginning" come out of "one." The Book of Documents repeatedly says, "The numbers begin with 'one'." Wang Jun's Explanation of Examples says, "This is the single line of the hexagram, the meaning of 'one line opening the sky'." Wang Bi said, "Firmly residing before all things," and the shape of the character "一" is indeed the source of the Six Writings. Xu Jun's preface places indicative characters before pictographic characters, and Duan said, "'One' in the Six Writings is an indicative character." Therefore, the Explanation of Writing establishes "one" as the beginning, first writing a single line to show its meaning, etc. Mrs. Yao then continued to lecture on the Classic of Filial Piety, presenting a few words in each chapter, all of which were fully elaborated with overflowing interest. The audience was full, all with smiles, and still paying close attention. At four o'clock, it was announced that Mr. Jiang Zhuzhuang would lecture on the Eight Consciousnesses of Buddhism on the 30th of the next session, and the session ended.

30th Session: The 30th lecture of the Rong Wu Sutra Study Society, the first session of the Buddhist Studies Lectures, was first introduced by Mr. Shen Jueling to introduce Mr. Jiang Zhuzhuang's lecture on the Eight Consciousnesses of Buddhism. Mr. Jiang has been studying Buddhism for many years. I listened to his lecture ten years ago. Today's lecture is on the easiest topic to enter. Then Mr. Jiang began to lecture, first presenting the four characters "governing the mind, truth and falsehood", followed by writing the four characters "returning to truth, restoring truth." The first five of the Eight Consciousnesses are the eye, ear, nose, tongue, and body, which are the discriminating meanings arising from the five objects of color, sound, fragrance, taste, and touch. The sixth is called "consciousness", which is the mental function of the dharmic realm. The seventh is called "Manas", which is the meaning of constant deliberation. The eighth is called "Alaya", which contains all the dharmas of the first seven consciousnesses, that is, the seeds of all things. The end part is based on one point in the Alaya consciousness as the ego, which is often clung to and not transformed. Therefore, the Manas consciousness is the most harmful. Since the Alaya consciousness encompasses everything, if it does not fall into the untransformable ego, then it can transform consciousness into wisdom and transcend to Buddhahood. Being able to diligently cultivate and practice according to the Dharma, to the point of being aware when a thought arises, one will naturally know it. After the lecture, it was nearly four o'clock. It was announced that Mr. Shen Jueling would lecture on the New Meaning of the Character "一" on the 27th of the twelfth month, and the session ended.

31st Session: The 31st National Studies Lecture of the Rong Wu Sutra Study Society, the third session, was given by Mr. Shen Jueling on the New Meaning of the Character "一" in the Explanation of Writing. The new meaning of the character "一" is actually the oldest saying, not only passed down orally, but has been forgotten by people after thousands of years. Therefore, it is called the new meaning.

All characters have three elements: form, sound, and meaning (simple characters are called "文", compound characters are called "字". The indicative and pictographic characters in the Six Writings are simple characters, and the associative and pictophonetic characters are compound characters. Transference and borrowing are the usage of characters).

The explanation of "一" in the Large Xu Explanation of Writing says, "Only the beginning, the Great Beginning, the Way is established in 'one', creating and dividing heaven and earth, transforming into all things." These four phrases actually include the elements of form and meaning.

The form of "一": The form has changed in many ways, but the form of "一" has not changed. In the early days, people were in the wilderness, looking at the horizon, which looked like the character "一". Above "一" is heaven, and below "一" is earth, so it is said that "一" fully opens heaven and earth. This is the beginning of the form.

The sound of "一": The change of sound requires understanding of alliteration and consonance, and understanding the changes of the four phonetic gradations of open, palatal, labial, and retroflex vowels. In short, they are open, palatal, labial, and retroflex. The open, palatal, labial, and retroflex of "一" are A, Yi, Wu, and Yu. Now "一" is read as "yu xi qie", which is the transformation of the Yi sound. In fact, the original sound was A. When a baby first leaves the mother's womb, it makes the sound A. Ya is the clipped sound of A, so A is the beginning of sound. Knowing "一" is the beginning of sound.

The meaning of "一": The meaning has not changed, but there are extensions and proliferations. Numbers start from "one". Lao Tzu said, "One begets two, two begets three, and three begets all things." The Song Confucian scholars said, "Scattered into ten thousand differences, united into one origin." Therefore, "one" is the beginning of number and the beginning of meaning.

Speaking to this point, Mr. Shen felt a little tired and needed to rest for a while. Mr. Yang Zhongyi continued to talk about the changes of "一", quoting extensively. It was still not finished at nearly four o'clock. Mr. Shen supplemented the changes of sound, using the official sound and the Wu dialect, Shanghai dialect, Changshu and Jiading dialects as proof. The sound of the character "一" is the point of the point, line, surface, and solid. It was originally a tongue sound, read as "zhu", then the tongue becomes a tooth. He then mentioned Mr. Qian Zhuting's saying that in ancient times there was a tongue sound, no alveolar sound, and a labiovelar sound, no labiodental sound. For example, the ancient sound of "鳳" (phoenix) was read as "peng", which is a labiovelar sound. Now it is read as "feng", which is a labiodental sound. He solemnly declared the importance of these two words.

### Woman Commits Suicide Due to Economic Hardship

Mrs. Zhang, a 49-year-old woman from Suzhou, residing at No. 6, Lane 310, Route de Grouchy in the French Concession, recently committed suicide by hanging herself on the wooden shed of the balcony at her home on the evening of the previous day due to economic hardship, which led to mental instability. When her husband, Wen Shuying, found out and rushed to her aid, it was too late. He immediately reported the incident to the French police, who sent detectives to transport the body to the Tongren Funeral Home for an autopsy. After confirming the cause of death, the husband prepared a coffin and made arrangements for the funeral.

### Wedding Announcements

Mr. Han Zhengping is chivalrous, righteous, charitable, and generous. The eighth of this month is the date of his younger sister's wedding. The ceremony will be held at the Shanghai Pudong Association Building. Famous amateur opera singers such as Sun Lanting will participate in the performance to offer congratulations. Mr. Han has a wide circle of friends. There will surely be a grand occasion with many carriages and horses.

Mr. Li Jinhua's son, Youde, and Miss Yan Chuntang's daughter, Shuqing, are scheduled to hold their wedding ceremony on January 7th at the Shanghai Pudong Association Building on Rue Edouard VII. We respectfully invite Hermit Wen Lanting to be the witness. There will also be a grand performance to add to the joy.

Yesterday's newspaper was released at 6:30 PM.

### Nanjing Road Loses its Brilliance

— Zhen

Public Notice: It is hereby notified that from January 1, 1942, all arc lamps, floodlights, decorative lights, and billboard lights are prohibited from use. Violators will be prosecuted. This is a notice.

The crown of sleeplessness that adorned the city has been removed from Shanghai's head. It performed a "no-hat ceremony" on New Year's Day 1942.

If you walk west from the Bund, the first thing that catches your eye is darkness. The once-brilliant New Year's lights will be put to sleep. The beautiful and colorful shop windows will also take a rest. Along the most prosperous Nanjing Road, we will appreciate a silent, speechless scene. Even if you have the greatest wisdom, you will not taste any beautiful or bright fragments. "Silent music is the most pleasant to the ear," which is perhaps the best tune on Nanjing Road in 1942.

Crossing Henan Road, the Lihua Company had a long row of red New Year's lights surrounding the entire building. The storefront of the Continental Department Store was two shops, and the signboard of the China National Products Company was long and wide, all wrapped around the edges of the signboard with tricolor lights, and the six large characters were circled brightly.

Further ahead were rows of shops. In order to attract and entice customers, almost every store had installed brilliant advertising lights. It was truly "every store has lights, no lights, no store," and they were novel, eye-catching, and full of tricks, with moving tubes that changed in an instant, sometimes red, sometimes green, the lights sliding east and west, rotating up and down. For example, a certain lingerie company had a wide and long signboard with a border of tricolor curved New Year's lights that rotated regularly. It rotated in opposite directions to the east-west road. When the two lights touched, they would repeat and go in opposite directions, like an endless stream. Every passerby would stop and look up as they passed its door, like an art appreciator seeing a treasure. But now this artistic treasure, although still grandly displayed as before, will be lamented by bargain hunters because of the time and place.

Every country gentleman or lady who comes to Shanghai wants to stroll around the bustling center of the Rising Sun Building. The reason why the Rising Sun Building is crowded with people every day, from an economic point of view, is that it is the commercial center with the largest department store. Geographically speaking, it is also a transportation hub, with streetcars and buses running crisscross in all directions. Because of these two reasons, not only are general merchants vying for that location as a place to buy and sell to make money, but advertising merchants are also trying to find a gap. The windows of the three major companies display various new items, surrounded by two rows of New Year's lights. It was really eye-catching and enticing in the evenings. Now fluorescent lights have replaced its position. These lights shine directly into your eyes in a straight line. If you look up again, the roof of the New Wing On Company has a new drug advertisement installed by a certain new pharmaceutical factory on all four sides. Each drug name is a different color, changing intermittently. The Shenchangchang store on Zhejiang Road also reveals a bright billboard that reflects the Qianlixiang of the Sincere Company. There are also those lottery sales stores, scattered with many light bulbs. These, these, whether light bulbs, fluorescent lights, etc., are of course billboard lights, decorative lights, etc., which are on the prohibited list. Thus, "the golden and red candles of the past will become will-o'-the-wisps today!"

### Brief News from the Art World

— Taixu

The "Madam Butterfly" starring Hu Die and "Ephemeral Couple" starring Yuan Meiyun and Gao Zhanfei, both produced by Guolian Company, were suspended due to the Hong Kong Incident. What is expected to be on the market for the lunar New Year is "Standard Lady" and "Green Forest Heroes" brought by Chen Yunshang from Hong Kong.

The new script after "National Beauty and Heavenly Fragrance" by Minhua is a story about a madman, written by Sima Yingcai, and is currently being revised.

Liu Qiong and Yan Fei have been married for several years and have no children. Recently, a friend went to Liu Qiong's house, and Liu Qiong showed a small glass bottle, pointing to a mass of flesh soaked in alcohol, and said, "My son is in here." It turned out that Yan Fei had a miscarriage.

The Lafayette Theater has been performing "Joy Comes to the Fight" by the mixed class of "Shanghai Theater" and "Shanghai Occupation" since New Year's Eve. Many film and theater actors are preparing to rent the Carlton, because the location of Park Road is "smarter" than Lafayette Road, but whether it will succeed is unknown.

### Full Month "Joy"

— Qin Ren

I went to a large restaurant to attend a friend's "full month" celebration for his son. That friend has always had extensive social connections. When his "late father's sixtieth birthday" was celebrated last year, it was truly a gathering of young and old, crowded together, a moment of great splendor. But whether this "late father's" "grandson" was born at the wrong time, only five tables of guests were seated in the huge hall that day, two of which were still direct relatives of this gentleman.

During the meal, the host had no intention of urging people to drink, and the guests naturally had no interest in "blushing". Moreover, the cashier was still in a major negotiation with the "child's father" over the "departure" of more than a dozen reserved tables!

### Begonia

— Qin Shouou

Sixteen. The Fire of Youth

When this news reached Beiping, it goes without saying that the tree fell and the猢孫 scattered [a metaphor for followers abandoning a disgraced leader]. Yuan Baofan's first wife had already died long ago. The only ones left in the family were three concubines and many "hungry ones gather, full ones scatter" relatives and dependents of officials. Upon hearing the news, they couldn't even help Old Yuan. Each person tried their best to pack up their valuables and quietly slipped out the door. In less than seven days, the magnificent mansion of Garrison Commander Yuan was left with only an empty house. Old Yuan's savings of half a lifetime were not wasted for nothing!

Xiangqi left the Yuan family and first stayed at a familiar classmate's house for half a year, trying every possible method to inquire about the whereabouts of Begonia and her father in the Peking opera circle. Finally, she managed to find out that they had returned to Li Village. She hurriedly sent someone to the countryside to send a letter, but Begonia had already moved away. The second time, the brother of Xiangqi's classmate personally rushed to Cang County for her. He met Begonia's uncle, and upon asking, he found out that they had indeed left, supposedly to open a shop with a friend in Jinan. Xiangqi then went to Jinan and stayed in a hotel for three whole months, but even after searching all over Jinan City, she couldn't find any trace of Begonia.

Later, she drafted several notices and had them published in newspapers in Jinan, Tianjin, Beiping, and even various places in the South, hoping that Begonia would see them. She herself returned to Beiping and lived alone in a small house, feeling depressed. Her brother, upon learning the news of Old Yuan's defeat and death, quickly sent three or four letters, urging her to go to Nanjing to live with him, but she always refused.

"They, father and daughter, must be in the North. I am willing to wait my whole life to find them!" she often said to herself in this way.

In fact, she was really searching tirelessly for her beloved husband and her own daughter. The consumption of mental energy and money could be said to have reached its peak, but unfortunately, there was still no news. (294)

Miscellaneous Talks on Entertainment

### New Year Fish-Dragon Performance

— Zefu

After the New Year's Day congratulations in the Han Dynasty, music was played in the palace, and there was usually a fish-dragon performance. A fish-dragon is a fish transformed into a dragon, symbolizing auspiciousness. The performance was quite similar to magic, and both the fish and the dragon were fake. The performers would first act out a Hanli (a beast, sometimes written as Sheli) coming from the West and performing in the courtyard. After the performance, it would enter the hall where the emperor resided. There was originally a pond in front of the hall. The beast would enter the pond and stir up the water, and in an instant, it would transform into a flounder, leaping in the water, spraying water to create mist, obscuring the sun. Suddenly, the fish would transform into a yellow dragon, eight zhang [about 24 meters] long, soaring out of the water and playing in the courtyard, dazzling in the sunlight. Then the performance would end, followed by acrobatic performances, such as tightrope walking. This performance began during the reign of Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty and still existed in the Sui Dynasty. Only it was called the Yellow Dragon Transformation, and the flounder was replaced by a large whale. When the water was stirred up, all kinds of fish, turtles, and other creatures in the water would emerge in droves, covering the ground, making it even more spectacular. After the Tang Dynasty, it was no longer heard of. According to today's folk customs, during the New Year, there is something called the dragon lantern. The dragon is also made up, several zhang long, winding and playing in the courtyards of farmhouses, but without any magic tricks. Could it be a variation of the fish-dragon performance from the Han Dynasty?

Zeren's Commentary

### Blocking the Flood of Unemployment

— Xiaotian

Unemployment is like a flood from a breached dam, rushing towards a metropolis that has always prided itself on its deformed status. All lives with weak foundations are washed away, submerged, and destroyed by the flood.

Those who haven't been tragically drowned look at the rolling flood with fear and trembling.

——Anyway, it's death, let's have some fun!

At this moment, people facing imminent death are aroused to laziness, decadence, and depression, ending their remaining lives with drinking, smoking, and wild dancing.

However, this is a dance around a volcano!

When the little severance pay in your pocket runs out and the fire of your life hasn't yet been extinguished, you will immediately encounter the most terrifying things: freezing and starvation! Friendship will no longer give you warmth but will coldly cast contemptuous glances at you.

You have no other way to go except suicide.

But why should you go down this dead end when you still have the strength to struggle?

Offering porridge and clothing only provides the homeless with temporary food and warmth but cannot block the ever-increasing flow of new unemployment.

We cannot build a long dam with millions of gold bars. How will we relieve this drowning panic?

"When water comes, use earth to block it!" The most reliable thing is your own strength, even if it's just a little bit.

If you get some severance pay, spending it won't take a few hours. However, when you want to dedicate your abilities to an ideal cause, this severance pay becomes very valuable startup capital.

If you want to start a practical business but feel that your own severance pay is not enough, you can pool the remaining funds of those who were laid off with you and do something together.

If you ask the employer to provide long-term living expenses, this request may not be fully granted. Then, you can ask the employer to invest in another business or allow the employees to manage some businesses themselves (such as at various bus stations, which would be the best). In this way, the employer might accept it. Not only would the employees have longer-term living support, but the original relationship between labor and management would also be maintained.

As for what to do? Do what we can do, what we should do!

We don't want passive relief; we want to actively rise up and use our abilities to block this flood of unemployment!

Let's not let the terrible flood inundate the entire Shanghai!

### Anecdotes

— Wen Zhen

Child: Mom, I like Sundays even more now!

Mother: Why?

Child: Because on Sundays, I don't have to go to school, and I can buy cookies and cakes to eat.

Mouse A: How miserable, I haven't found food for days!

Mouse B: What's the reason for that?

Mouse A: Because people can only afford to buy food for the day, and by night, their homes are empty!

Mouse B: Why don't you go to the homes of the rich?

Mouse A: Even worse, now they can't go out for nightlife and stay at home, how dare we move around?

A: What is the "automobile class"?

B: That refers to the workers on garbage trucks, firefighters and nurses on fire trucks and ambulances, and police officers...

Family

### New Year

— Yi

At the beginning of the year, there are usually many new hopes, and many people habitually make their New Year's plans in the New Year.

In the family, there are many things waiting for us to rectify, such as starting this year, preparing to never play mahjong again, preparing to finish reading several books in a year, preparing to save some money in a year, and preparing to gain a few pounds in a year.

At the beginning of the year, the formulation of a new budget can also be said to be an urgent task. Reviewing the past and planning the future can all be decided at this time.

The common problem that most people have is the lack of decisiveness and perseverance. Therefore, they pass year after year without making any progress. In fact, no matter what you have to do, simply starting it is already half the battle. Right at the start of the New Year, I hope readers quickly decide on this year's new plan and sever ties with all bad old habits.

10. Are you sure you want to marry him (or her) and live together forever?

My Family Problems

### Announcement of the Thirteenth Essay Submission - White-Haired Husband

— Shui

This time, a family of six fled to Shanghai. Unfortunately, my father was too traumatized and soon (four years ago) suffered from paralysis, unable to move his limbs. My mother was originally a virtuous wife and loving mother, but she couldn't make a living. One younger brother and two younger sisters were all around the age of thirteen. As for me, although I had registered for the third year of high school at a certain school, I could only give it up. We usually didn't have much savings, so the livelihood of the six of us became a serious problem!

After struggling for two years, we really couldn't maintain it anymore. If we didn't think of a solution, then... At this time, someone took the opportunity to be a matchmaker, saying that I was nineteen years old, how rich the man's family was, and that marrying him would guarantee a worry-free life for the family, etc. The matchmaker even handed over 10,000 yuan in cash as proof. Finally, with tears streaming down my parents' faces, I agreed.

After I married over, I suddenly realized why the man's family was willing to be so generous. It turned out that my husband was sixty-nine years old! His hair was already sparse and gray, and he had a tuft of white beard about an inch long under his chin. (At first, we only knew that he was a wealthy merchant in his forties.)

Life is very comfortable. He has five daughters and three sons, all of whom are either married off or have married and started their own small families outside. The children are all very filial and visit him from time to time. This time, he remarried; his first wife had only died recently when he married me. Alas, he is not only old but also has many illnesses and pains, spending 300 days a year in bed! Since I married over, although we have shared a bed, I am still a virgin! All day long, besides serving him medicine, I stay by his bedside, massaging his knees and back, serving him. Cooking and laundry are all done by the maid. Occasionally, he also tells me that although he has a crowd of children and servants, their service is ultimately not as considerate and intimate as that of a wife. This is the only reason he married me! Unknowingly, two years have passed in this kind of life. In these two years, the material life has been enough for me to enjoy. But from time to time, there is a kind of physiological impulse, and at that time, I can only try my best to suppress it. Alas! Many things can be done with money, but this, this is something that money cannot buy.

Divorce? What about the family's livelihood? What about my younger siblings' education fees?

The old man has many friends who often come to visit him. Among them is a young man who treats me very well, sympathizes with and understands everything about me, and often invites me to pure, friendship-based social gatherings to relieve my loneliness and boredom. I heard that he is not yet married and is currently working as a construction engineer at a certain construction factory. However, I am also an advancing woman. I also thought about doing something with my high school education to save myself and my family! But if I don't leave this white-haired husband, then I won't be allowed to think about anything.

Alas, I wonder if there is a twenty-one-year-old young man in this world who would marry a seventy-one-year-old sick woman as his wife.

Usually, women have nowhere to confide their grievances. Like me, a poor woman, the unspeakable bitterness is even more nowhere to be told.

Editor's Note: The problem raised by Ms. Shui is really a victim of a marriage for sale. She married for the sake of her own and her family's six-member living issues. Stability of life is the right she enjoys, and mental pain is the duty she bears. Naturally, we give our utmost sympathy for the position she bears because she never truly participated in marriage, but only found a nursing job. This white-haired husband, although he has already paid a considerable price and fulfilled considerable duties, it seems that deceiving a helpless woman with this price and duty cannot be equal in terms of gains and losses.

However, the biggest reason for Ms. Shui's marriage was for living issues. We do not agree with this deformed marriage, but before the problem is resolved, we don't know what advice we can give Ms. Shui.

There is nothing unreasonable about forming a pure friendship with that young man, but to break away from the white-haired husband, it is best to first study the legal aspects and at the same time make a real effort to find a way to make oneself economically independent; because for a high school graduate to find a job to support a family of six is not an easy task. Perhaps a path to survival can be opened by progressing in both self-cultivation and temporary patience.

A son, when he gets a wife, will no longer be your son. But a daughter will always be your daughter.

### Truly a Good Idea

— Hua

Mexican Jihua's Law

In Jihua, Mexico, there is a law that if a man is found talking to a woman in a park after 10 p.m., he must marry her. It's a good idea because it can reduce men's chances of fooling around outside and make men more devoted to women's love.

### A Week of Home Cooking Menu

— Ms. Hua Ying

The weather has been colder these days, and the water freezes at night, so frozen tofu is also a seasonal item. It's just that this year's tofu is already the price of meat, so frozen tofu is especially precious. If you want to try it, then buying it for five or six cents is enough to eat. Braising frozen tofu with pork slices is the most flavorful. If you put it in a hot pot and eat it hot, it is very delicious. If you eat vegetarian, then you can't do without many auxiliary products such as shiitake mushrooms, sharp bamboo shoots, fungus, and lily buds. Without them, the flavor will feel a little different. But if you don't use these things and simply braise it with scallions, and add a little pepper powder to it when you eat it, it is also quite flavorful.
