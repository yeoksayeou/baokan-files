German Leader's Headquarters, 14th, Huitong News Agency Telegram

Today's German war report states that with the assistance of aircraft, German forces in the Caucasus continue to occupy several high grounds on the road between Mei Guipu and Tuapse. In the battle, a German division independently captured one hundred enemy strongholds. Soviet counter-attacks on the Stalingrad and Kerch front lines have been repelled. German aircraft bombed troop and war material transport on the east bank of the Volga River and attacked Soviet airfields in the Black Sea. A Soviet medium-sized merchant ship was lost in the Volga River. Italian aircraft shot down two enemy aircraft on the Don River front. In the central sector of the Eastern Front, German forces captured sixty-four enemy strongholds, capturing many prisoners. German aircraft attacked enemy ships at low altitude over the Gulf of Finland, with one Soviet gunboat hit and on fire.

Military circles here issued a statement this afternoon on the situation on the Eastern Front, stating that German forces in the Caucasus have occupied several high grounds, annihilating a portion of the enemy forces and capturing hundreds of underground artillery positions. Enemy counter-attacks on the Stalingrad and Don River fronts have been repelled. Apart from this, there are only local battles on the Eastern Front. In the central sector of the Eastern Front, German forces captured sixty-four enemy strongholds and captured a large number of prisoners.

Military observers here believe that the most noteworthy aspect of the Eastern Front battlefield is that German forces are only a few miles away from Tuapse Port. However, the geographical conditions of this war zone are favorable to the Soviet Union, and the German forces still face various difficulties. Therefore, the port is not likely to fall for the time being. The German side has concentrated two infantry divisions, mountain troops, and a Slovak motorized unit in the Kupen River basin and along the Black Sea coast. Recently, infantry reinforcements and a large blood clot tank brigade have been transferred in, and since the 12th of this month, they have launched a large-scale offensive under the cover of artillery fire. This fortress is very important, and the Red Army is willing to defend the port to the death at any cost. If it unfortunately falls, the Soviet Black Sea Fleet will lose another base, and the German forces will gain a gateway to invade the Transcaucasus region. In addition, according to German sources, the Soviet Union is preparing to launch large-scale counter-attacks in the areas north of Smolensk, Rzhev, and Stalingrad. Soviet transportation on the Volga River is frequent and increasing daily. In the Stalingrad area, German forces are still launching repeated attacks in the northwest industrial area to reduce General Timoshenko's pressure between the Don and Volga Rivers.

Observers here are currently analyzing the situation on the Eastern Front: (1) Tuapse Port has been surrounded by German forces that have reached the Black Sea coast a few miles south of the port. The situation in the area has temporarily stalled to allow German forces to calmly prepare for the siege. (2) The Red Army's resistance in the Losni area is exceptionally fierce, but all Red Army attacks have been repelled. German forces have made little progress in the Ottrozhnycheetz and Gebos outpost areas. Snowstorms in the area hinder operations greatly. (3) Stalingrad: There has only been intense artillery fire in the area in the past 24 hours. It is said that this is the new strategy of the German High Command to destroy the last resistance centers of the Red Army. Once the major factories and houses currently held by the Red Army are destroyed, the German side will launch an infantry assault. At the same time, fierce fighting continues north of the city. The Red Army has constructed and consolidated a large bridgehead in Kachalinsk, but neither side has achieved decisive results. (4) A Berlin spokesperson stated that fighting is breaking out and subsiding alternately on both banks of the Don River. Observers here believe that this is direct proof of the Red Army's arrival at the Don River bend. (5) The Voronezh area has been quiet for a week, but it is reported that the Red Army has made several local attacks and concentrated a large force.

### German Forces in Stalingrad and the Caucasus Change Tactics

A Certain Place on the Soviet Border, 13th, Havas News Agency Telegram

According to a telegram from neutral observers on the Eastern Front, the German forces operating in Stalingrad and the Caucasus have now changed their tactics. Until now, the tactics used in all battlefields have always been those of the First World War, with artillery units as the vanguard, followed by tanks, and infantry units closely following the motorized units. However, based on the experience of this war, this tactic is clearly no longer suitable because anti-tank guns are becoming increasingly advanced, and tank losses are heavy. In view of this, the German forces are preparing to dispatch a small number of machine gun teams to infiltrate the Red Army lines, specifically to destroy enemy anti-tank guns so that they cannot be used. Then, they will order armored units to launch an attack. According to front-line news, the fighting in the Stalingrad area is still ongoing north of the city. The blood clot army in the Mok area has received reinforcements and is attacking the Red Army no less than six or seven times a day.

Tokyo, 14th, Domei News Agency Telegram

Representatives from the Manchurian Concord Association, Zhang Huanxiang; the Chinese East Asia League, Lin Baisheng; the New People's Association, Zhang Zijun; and the Mongolian Asia Development Cooperation Conference, Chen Yuming, successively expressed their opinions. They all agreed that the key to world peace lies in the development of Asia. Based on this premise, the formation of the core of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere is a necessity. To realize this, the three governments should contact each other and formulate concrete measures. The people of China, Japan, and Manchuria are the central pillars of the various ethnic groups in Greater East Asia and should maintain close contact with each other, cooperate, and launch an Asia Development National Movement. Finally, Mitsuo Miyata, a permanent advisor from the Japanese side, expressed his support. Everyone stood up to show their support. President Lin decided to adopt the proposal, and the meeting adjourned at noon. In the afternoon, all the representatives visited the Painting Museum and the Naval Memorial Hall.

Tokyo, 14th, Domei News Agency Telegram

The Greater Japan Asia Development Alliance submitted a proposal for the concrete implementation of the Sino-Japanese-Manchu Joint Declaration at the Liaison Conference of the Sino-Japanese-Manchu Asia Development Groups, and President Yamaoka explained the reasons for the proposal. The details are as follows: (Summary of the Proposal) (1) In the future, such conferences will be held at appropriate times. The timing and methods will be decided before the next meeting. (2) Regularly exchange mining well engineers to gather common intentions regarding the Asia Development concept. (3) Publish magazines, exchange books, exchange information, and cooperate in various movements. (4) Maintain close contact with each other regarding cultural propaganda. (5) Personnel from each group should inspect and visit each other to enhance mutual friendship. (Reasons for the Proposal) In order to drive out the invading forces of Britain and the United States, ensure the security of East Asia, and further contribute to world peace, greater efforts must be made in the future. It goes without saying that the total strength of the people of all countries must be united to establish a system in which all ethnic groups in Greater East Asia are one family, and to actively launch an Asia Development movement is essential. There are many measures to implement this, but the most important is to make the Sino-Japanese-Manchu Joint Declaration concrete and to make this the focus of the issue. The Sino-Japanese-Manchu Joint Declaration is based on the spirit of morality, establishes a common goal of building a new order in East Asia, and the three countries of China, Japan, and Manchuria will form a permanent peaceful pivot. With this as the center, we will move forward in the construction of Greater East Asia. Therefore, planning for cooperation in national defense, thorough anti-communism, and economic promotion are all necessary. Therefore, it is necessary to launch an Asia Development movement based on the Three-Nation Joint Declaration. To make the Three-Nation Joint Declaration concrete, five measures are proposed.

### Stimson Asks U.S. Congress to Lower the Draft Age from 20 to 18

Lisbon, 14th, Domei News Agency Telegram

U.S. Secretary of War Stimson yesterday asked Congress to quickly pass a bill to lower the draft age from 20 to 18. Stimson also said that the United States is at a critical juncture and urgently needs additional soldiers. This bill has been under review by the Military Affairs Committees of both houses of Congress. The House Military Affairs Committee will begin discussions today and then submit it to the House for discussion on Saturday. The Senate will discuss it in two weeks.

Buenos Aires, Argentina, 13th, Central News Agency Telegram

In his fireside chat on the 12th, U.S. President Roosevelt specially declared that in order to remedy the problem of labor shortage, requisition orders must be applied to rural factories. At the same time, in response to this talk, Secretary of the Army Stimson sent a letter to Congress on the 13th requesting that the current minimum age of 20 for conscription be changed to 18. This matter has been made into a draft amendment to the conscription law by the upper and lower houses and, in response to the requirements of Roosevelt and Stimson, is prepared to begin deliberation in a public meeting on the 14th. For Stimson's original letter will take the form of a report. The general idea of ​​Stimson's original letter, which was officially published on the 13th after Roosevelt's fireside chat, is that we are at a critical juncture today, so we ask the parliament to amend the conscription law as soon as possible and change the minimum age for conscription to 18 years of age. It is most necessary for the United States to maintain a majority of soldiers at this time. Our most important responsibility to the modern American people and our children is to build the world's best army in the shortest possible time. This responsibility is also an urgent matter that cannot be delayed for a moment, and if we want to have an army, we must not only have excellent equipment, but also ensure that the talents, confidence, combat will, and energy of a soldier are all able to pretend to drive enemy soldiers. In addition, Roosevelt previously stated that there was no need to lower the conscription age before January or February of next year, but the government's request to amend the conscription law immediately is expected to be due to the expansion of the war, which has required a larger amount of manpower than expected. At the same time, it was determined that the soldiers around the age of 40 who were recruited according to the current conscription law were unable to undergo strenuous training, so this decision was made. According to the estimation of the Bureau of the Census, there are about 2.5 million young people in the United States aged 18 and 19, but most of them have responded to the recruitment of the army and navy and have enlisted, so it is predicted that the number of people who can be obtained after this conscription age is reduced to about one million.

Officials here announced today that after fierce fighting with British forces north of Ambovietra in Madagascar, French forces have now retreated to new positions. The enemy suffered considerable damage in this battle.

### Spokespersons for Various Governments (III)

### The Role of the United Kingdom

Before the war, the British spokesperson in the Foreign Office was not a significant figure. Based on our experience, we know that two individuals took turns fulfilling the role of spokesperson. Their method was to alternate, saying, "I have no comment today," or, "I'm afraid I cannot tell you."

Mr. Peak was not well-liked among the group of journalists, including the British reporters. Later, he followed the new Ambassador to the United States, Lord Halifax, to Washington as an intelligence attaché.

The other spokesperson, Mr. Readsdale, was a pleasant fellow. Although he often felt compelled to say, like his superior Mr. Peak, "I'm afraid I cannot tell you," his fixed response was delivered so kindly that the reporters seemed to perceive a deeper meaning.

### Spokespersons in the Far East

Outside of America, no other place in the world has newspaper circulation as extensive as Japan, especially in Tokyo. Therefore, it is easy to understand why the Japanese government has always paid special attention to newspapers, especially foreign newspapers. Thus, as in other locations, the role of government spokesperson in Japan largely involved paying attention to foreign newspapers. Initially, the spokesperson was an official from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. This system remained unchanged for the first three years of the Sino-Japanese War. It was only after the establishment of the Information Bureau in 1940 that officials from the Information Bureau assumed the role of spokesperson.

The first spokesperson was Ishii, who was transferred to the Japanese Embassy in Bangkok when the Greater East Asia War was about to erupt. His successor, the current spokesperson, is Mr. Hori. Like Ishii, Hori's specialty lies in his understanding of foreign newspapers. As a result of the war, the scale of Hori's press conferences has become smaller. Aside from journalists from the Axis powers of Japan, Germany, and Italy, only one French and two Soviet reporters participate. The largest group of foreign reporters is German, with fourteen individuals representing various German news agencies and newspapers.

Hori's special strength lies in his thorough commentary on the current situation. His commentaries are complete from start to finish and do not require deletion or additions to be published as carefully written political essays. Consequently, the Axis powers often publish his commentaries as political essays. His experience in the diplomatic service and his previous experience as a spokesperson elsewhere greatly assist him in his current role. From 1924 to 1928, Hori was a secretary at the Japanese Embassy in Washington. He was briefly transferred to Qingdao, Nanjing, and Shanghai. Then, in 1934, he was transferred to the United States as a consul in Los Angeles until 1937. In 1937, he went to Qingdao to serve as the spokesperson for joint press conferences held by the Japanese Consulate and the Japanese Army and Navy authorities. It was only when he served as the Japanese spokesperson in Shanghai from December 1940 that he became famous. Later, he was transferred to his current position—Director of the Publicity Department of the Information Bureau.

Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the importance of the Information Bureau has certainly increased. News originating from Tokyo occupies the main space in newspapers worldwide. Especially with the Japanese government issuing a series of reports on the unprecedented victories of the army, navy, and air force, global newspapers pay even greater attention to news from Tokyo. The term "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere" was first used by the Japanese spokesperson before being transmitted to newspapers and the public worldwide.

In contrast to the situation in many countries, Japan has several spokespersons. Mr. Hori only comments on purely political events. For military matters, there are separate spokespersons for the Army and Navy. These two spokespersons do not host foreign journalists but regularly broadcast military-related commentary on the radio. Therefore, foreign journalists frequently listen to their statements. Occasionally, Mr. Hori also broadcasts comments on purely political events domestically via radio. Outside of Japan, especially in Shanghai and Beijing, there are also press conferences held by the Japanese authorities.

In Shanghai, the Japanese Army spokesperson is Lieutenant Colonel Yokoyama, the Navy spokesperson is Ambassador Kamata, and the Embassy spokesperson is Hirota. The fact that the Japanese side has appointed these outstanding individuals as spokespersons demonstrates the importance they attach to this issue. Like Mr. Hori, Lieutenant Colonel Yokoyama only became famous after assuming the position of Japanese Army spokesperson in Shanghai. These three spokespersons, accompanied by some deputy spokespersons and a few clever interpreters, host reporters from China, Japan, Germany, Italy, France, and Russia twice a week at the Cathay Hotel, discussing current events in a harmonious atmosphere.

The Japanese government has consistently adopted a policy of freedom of speech. Therefore, it was only after four years of the Sino-Japanese War that Japan began to compile news. However, even after the outbreak of the Pacific War, news censorship remained very lenient. Especially since most of the foreign reporters in Tokyo were nationals of Japan's allied countries, the Japanese government's attitude was even more tolerant. (End)

### Price Controls on Meat Implemented by the Shanghai Municipal Council; Black Market Continues to Exist; Supply Fails to Meet Demand, Pork Still Purchased at High Prices, with the Highest Price Reaching 18 Yuan

The Shanghai Times reports that most vegetable market vendors and butcher shops in the Public Concession yesterday (the 13th) were selling beef and mutton in accordance with the maximum retail price limit promulgated by the Shanghai Municipal Council. However, the sale of pork remains in a state of extreme chaos. For example, pork leg or loin meat is priced as high as 16 to 18 yuan per pound, while the limit price announced by the Shanghai Municipal Council is 8.40 yuan.

Still Need to Purchase Pork at High Prices

Butcher shops in both concessions and some vendors in vegetable markets such as Seymour Road do sell a small amount of pork at the limit price. However, this is far from sufficient to meet the daily needs of residents. Therefore, most housewives who want to purchase pork have no choice but to pay a high price of 16 to 18 yuan per pound, especially in the Hongkou vegetable market. Vendors in that market sell pork for no less than 18 yuan. Butchers in northern Shanghai say that they cannot sell various types of pork at the Shanghai Municipal Council's limit price because they would incur losses. They purchase entire pigs from the slaughterhouse based on the total weight. However, after the pigs are slaughtered, there is considerable weight loss. Since the pig's head and other parts cannot be sold at a good price, they have no choice but to charge a higher price to compensate for this loss.

Supply Fails to Meet Demand, with Numerous Malpractices

According to investigations conducted by reporters, the price of pork at the Pike Road vegetable market yesterday was the most reasonable, sold at the controlled price. Each person could purchase a maximum of one catty. However, the amount was insufficient, and the vendors made exorbitant profits. Customers did not dare to argue because they felt fortunate to be able to purchase a small amount of pork. The price of pork at the Fuzhou Road vegetable market was 16 to 18 yuan per pound, but there were still many buyers. The situation in the French Concession was similar. Many people believe that the main reason for the high price of pork and the existence of a black market is the scarcity of goods.

Price Controls on Beef and Mutton Prove Effective

Although retail price controls on beef and mutton were only implemented yesterday, good results have already been seen. Experts from the Goods Control Section of both concessions have clearly closely controlled the supply and distribution of beef. Although there is a price limit, a large amount of beef is still available. Because the demand is high, sales are also rapid. Yesterday afternoon, some butcher shops were unwilling to sell certain types of beef at the limit price. However, it is generally expected that after inspectors from the Goods Control Section discover violations and impose heavy penalties, butchers will strictly adhere to the limit price.

### French Concession Periodically Replaces Rickshaw Pullers' Licenses

### Criminal Report for the French Concession

The French Concession Police Department's criminal report for September states that there were three armed robbery cases in early September, all committed by two robbers, one of whom had a pistol. The two robbers were arrested on September 13, and the pistol was seized at their residence. It was later determined that the pistol had been robbed from a Sikh watchman in the Public Concession on February 13 of this year. In addition, most of the stolen goods were recovered. In September, there was one attempted assassination, 21 burglary cases, 44 breaking-and-entering cases, and 12 robbery cases, of which 44 cases were solved, and 27 criminals were arrested. In the same month, there were only 261 simple theft cases reported, compared to 286 in August, of which 67 cases were solved, and 69 criminals were arrested. A total of 60 bicycles were stolen. Eleven thieves were arrested, and 12 stolen bicycles were recovered. In addition, the household registration office of the French Concession Police Department issued a total of 89,566 identification cards in September, 22,092 people moved out, 16,518 people moved in, 1,517 births were recorded, and 835 deaths were recorded.

### Fourteenth Period Ration Quantities

### It's Easy to Study, Hard to Eat: YMCA Opens Student Cafeteria, Eagerly Awaits Assistance from Sympathizers

The difficulty students currently face in eating is a universal phenomenon. There are two ways to solve this problem: (1) Universally open economic, nutritious, and hygienic cafeterias (2) Provide relief to students with general financial difficulties. The Shanghai YMCA Student Relief Committee's movement to open student cafeterias and subsidize meals for impoverished students is launched to meet this need. It is hoped that all sectors will work hard to donate and send funds to the YMCA at Eight Immortals Bridge or the YWCA at 638 Weihaiwei Road. What is published here is the cry of those who feel the pain firsthand. Since the YMCA has shouldered the heavy responsibility of solving the problem of students eating, let us all share some of the burden. Let us unite and help the YMCA (Editor).

### A Meal Costs at Least Three Yuan

When classmates meet, they sometimes discuss lunch, and almost everyone frowns and sighs, "Eating is difficult."

If you live so far from school, and you want to rush home after class, take the tram, eat a quick lunch, and then rush back to school by tram, don't even mention how expensive the tram fares are now, just the time alone is too late. Moreover, rushing after a meal is far from healthy.

If you don't go home, then have lunch outside. Choose the most economical restaurant near the school to eat a set meal. Hey, each meal costs at least three yuan. Six meals a week, at least three or four hundred yuan per semester. Our tuition fee is only two or three hundred yuan per semester!

Since set meals are so expensive, save a little and eat a bowl of plain noodles or buy a bread to fill your stomach. But a bowl of plain noodles is shallow, and after eating one bowl, people always feel like having another. And bread is cold and hard. After eating it, you really want to have a cup of hot tea to feel comfortable. As a result, although the price of plain noodles and bread is not much cheaper compared to set meals, your health has already been affected after a few months.

### Students from Other Provinces Face Even Greater Difficulties

Just eating a lunch outside has already made the students feel so much trouble, but there are also students who come to Shanghai to study from other provinces, which is two or three times more trouble, or even more. Some of them live in schools that only provide accommodation but not meals, and some rent a room with several classmates and take care of their own meals. This is really terrible. Just imagine, getting up early in the morning, lighting the stove, finishing breakfast, cleaning up the dishes, and then going to school with a satchel. What is this like? Moreover, these days, rice is expensive, vegetables are expensive, oil is expensive, salt is expensive, and firewood is also expensive. In this case, at the end of the month, each person will probably need at least two or three hundred yuan per month.

### Impact on Youth Health

In general schools, there are indeed many students who live a wealthy life on weekdays, but there are also quite a few students with difficult circumstances. After class, seven or eight students sit together and chat idly, talking about world events and then turning to personal matters. The conversation then turns to each person's health problems.

Student A said: "My stomach has been hurting a lot these days. This is the result of eating hard bread for the past six months."

Student B said: "Isn't that right? My stomach problems are also getting worse. I'm always hungry. It hurts when I'm hungry, and I eat when it hurts, but I can't eat much. But after a short time, I immediately feel hungry and in pain again. It's a three-part symphony of eating."

Student C said: "I have insomnia at night, nerve pain, weak limbs, and a sore back. The doctor said it's a lack of nutrition and told me to pay more attention to the ingredients of food in the future. But where does the money come from?"

Student D said: "I have to light the stove, buy vegetables, cook, and wash clothes every day. These things are really tiring. How can I have the mind to study? By the evening, God knows how tired I am."

### Need for a Healthy Body

Really, if we were to conduct an on-the-spot investigation of the students' health problems, it would really be shocking. Stomach pain and lung disease are common diseases among students. Fatigue, malnutrition, and emotional irritability are common situations among students. Among ten students, it is rare to find two or three who fully meet the standards of good health.

Education is the first step to a career, but to succeed in education, you must first have a healthy body. Pale-faced scholars who are prone to illness are no longer welcome in modern society. We need lively and robust young people to be the masters of our future society. Then, how should we care about the physical health of the students who will become the masters of the future?

### Realization of the Ideal Cafeteria

In the past, many students were always fantasizing that it would be best to have such an ideal restaurant, with economical prices, clean food, and ingredients that meet the principles of nutrition, and the location would be best not far from the school. In that case, students who live far from home would not have to rush home to eat lunch or swallow plain noodles and chew hard bread to fill their stomachs within an hour and a half, resulting in stomach problems. Students from other provinces who take care of their own meals would not have to waste a lot of good time on trivial matters such as lighting the stove and cooking.

Sometimes ideals can really become reality. Isn't that right? The student cafeteria opened by the YMCA arose in response to this need. Economical, clean, and meeting the principles of nutrition, we have not found all these characteristics in any other place so far. Of course, the student cafeteria has not reached 100% of the ideal, but in this difficult time, it is really a blessing for the students to have such a cafeteria. It is hoped that enthusiastic people in the society will pay more attention to this issue and support this movement to help students with their meals.

### Cotton Cloth is Firm but Transactions are Surprisingly Light

There is not much old goods, but the price is more suitable than other goods, and the industry is not eager to sell, showing a tight market.

### Night of Air Raid Drill and Blackout

— Wu Xu

The air raid began, with small lights lit, and there were tense shouts outside.

We covered the windows with heavy black curtains, and the lampshade also put on a black overcoat. The walls were dim, and the light was concentrated in the center of the room.

I opened a crack in the door and peeked out. The streetlights were all off. Besides being pitch black, I couldn't see anything. This was the darkest night I had ever encountered in my life, and I couldn't help but feel suffocated in my heart—I had to go out tonight!

I quickly pulled my head back and pondered in my heart. Running out in such a dark night, with the whole city as dark as a crow, with everyone unable to see their fingers and groping around like blind people, wouldn't that cause trouble? I was a little worried.

But after listening carefully, the sound of footsteps outside was endless. There seemed to be many people walking, and their steps seemed to be quite fast. If others can walk, why can't I?

I boldly opened the door and went out, placing myself in the vast darkness. Looking around, it was a pitch-black mass, making people feel disoriented. Standing in the darkness for less than half a minute, the threat of darkness seemed to have subsided a little. I gradually made out vague figures of people. I saw the outlines of the houses. I saw the gray-blue sky. I saw the clouds in the sky and also saw the stars in the sky. So I saw the direction I should go and strode towards my destination.

The darkness of society is also like this. Young people, shocked by the reputation of social darkness, often shy away from society. In fact, if you rush into society and place yourself in society, you can have a clearer understanding of society. You can understand that society is not entirely dark and without sunlight. Above the darkness, you can see the surrounding things more clearly. You can also see the faintly bright sky and the shimmering stars. If you have a certain direction, you can still freely walk your own path.

The darkness of society is originally meant for us to conquer.

### Teachers and Classmates

— Yangzijiang

Currently, we are in an era of drastic turmoil. The friends around me have inevitably undergone significant changes. I feel that these changes contain infinite emotion and highlight many realistic problems.

When I was studying at school, I met H, the economics teacher. After returning to China from further studies, he took up teaching positions in several famous universities in this city. His extensive knowledge, correct theory, unrestrained demeanor, and scholarly attitude have influenced countless young students and cultivated many talented people. Because I admired him very much, I was particularly close to him.

After leaving school, I always felt that the courses taught by Professor H were the most insightful and rewarding, always occupying the most fruitful and memorable page of my school life.

A few days ago, I unexpectedly encountered him in a Russian restaurant on Avenue Joffre. The long separation and unexpected reunion made us feel particularly close.

We relived the old dream of happy conversations in school and gradually shifted the topic to recent life. He still used the same demeanor as when he taught in the classroom and talked about some economic theories such as Keynes's monetary theory and Jevons's law of price fluctuations. Then, he said to me in a calm tone:

"Everything in society now shows abnormalities. Currently, my personal economic life is inevitably feeling difficult. If I had become a merchant, I would have only needed to hoard the US dollars I spent after going abroad, and I would have become a millionaire by now—although millionaires only have statistical significance at present, haha." These few laughs seemed like sarcasm and mockery.

I admire his integrity and respect his spirit.

After the meal, I finally reluctantly shook hands with him, but I felt a sense of loss in my heart.

Two years ago, one of our old classmates from middle school graduated from the X Li Conservatory of Music. We were all very happy for him. In the current situation, musical talent is so scarce, and musical talent has such a promising future! He himself also left school with hopeful feelings and stepped into this society. He had optimism, and he also had confidence.

Soon, he found an ideal job—working as a music teacher in a middle school. But the salary was of course as meager as usual, which brought disappointment. So he wanted to switch to the business world to make a living for a period of time. But where could he find someone who studies music to take on a commercial position? This brought a second disappointment.

A few months ago, I received news that he had returned to his hometown and opened a small shop. This unexpected event simply made me unable to believe it. Until recently, I received a detailed letter from him:

"Currently, prices are soaring. Although it is said that small shops are making huge profits, there is no need to suffer the hardships of teaching in Shanghai. However, in this remote country, I am almost completely isolated from music and forced to do things that go against my own will. The spiritual pain I feel is self-evident. If the fate of cultured people is like this, then will the dark age of medieval Europe reappear in this place today?"

### Life on the Stage

— Liang Can

(III) Floating and Sinking in the Sea of Stars

Peking Opera actors each have their own teachers. Some learn from famous teachers, and some learn from training classes. Drama actors do not yet have Tan style or Qi style. Their origins are worth studying. Obviously, drama does not yet have training classes. There is a National Academy of Dramatic Arts, but it was founded not long ago, and the talents it has cultivated are not many. Currently, the largest number of actors in various drama troupes can be divided into two categories: one is that they have performed in amateur drama clubs and have achieved considerable success, and they have become professional actors through introductions. The other is that when the drama troupe's actors are insufficient, they publicly recruit and are recruited through procedures such as performance auditions.

Now, for example, I have performed in nine plays in an amateur drama club, and the results have been very good. I am like a leading actor in this drama club. Perhaps the director of one of your performances, Mr. So-and-so, is acting in a certain drama troupe. So you often go to see free plays and go backstage to play. Then, you ask Mr. So-and-so to introduce you to act. Mr. So-and-so will remember it. Maybe one day when he is arranging a new difficult actor list, and he lacks a servant or a character with a dozen or so words, Mr. So-and-so will say, "I have a friend, let him play it!" So the day you have been waiting for finally comes. It is such an honor to show your face on the stage and be on the same stage with the great actors you usually admire. At that time, how fast your heart will beat! But when you look at the role, you have to think about yourself. In the amateur drama club, the leading actor is not happy to play it, but alas, you still have to be patient. So you start rehearsing. This play may not have a place for you to show your skills at all, or you may be stage fright as soon as you go on stage, then your future will be very dangerous. But maybe you perform steadily, and at the same time they need people, so after a play, they will ask you to sign a contract, but it is just to continue running on the set. After running like this for a year or two, then maybe they will assign you a more important role. That is the most important opportunity for you to become famous. Everything depends on your own efforts. Maybe you are not very happy to hear that you have to run a two-year set. Yes, this is still good. Sometimes, you are assigned an important role the first time you are on stage. Maybe they are not satisfied when you rehearse for the first time, then you are finished—you don't even have that opportunity two years later. As for public recruitment, there are always two or three hundred to six or seven hundred people each time. Among these many people, after the preliminary test, the re-test, and the oral test, like panning for gold in the sand, only six or seven people are selected. And these 1% lucky people who step into the door of the stage are just beginning their set life as a follower, a servant, or a third-rate actor.

You often watch plays and feel that there are nine people who are acting very immaturely, so please forgive him. Maybe it is his first time on stage, but he is still lucky after all, because every year five or six hundred reserve actors walk out of the backstage door in disappointment, leaving the five or six who work hard on the stage day and night. One year, two years, maybe a few years later, he may be a brilliant star!

### In the Same Boat Through Storms

— He Jia Branch

(10) Flying Peak

Sister Xi Que and Mother He answered in unison. Huang Longdao, you and Father Huang Shao have wine, come outside to drink! Huang Long said, whether it's good to go outside or not, but Brother Weicheng and Sister Cuizhen are not allowed to cry! Second Aunt, I'm entrusting this matter to you! Huang Long and Mother He went outside. Only three people were left in the room. Second Madam Ye sat on the edge of the bed. Cuizhen was tired and sat on a low stool in front of the bed. Weicheng's face was covered with a glorious question. Sister Cuizhen, you've suffered! Cuizhen said, What does it matter if I suffer a little? Today, Brother Huang saved me from the brink of death, and I met Second Aunt and Brother Cheng in the same room again. This time's happiness is worth ten times the pain! Look, I'm laughing again, haha, I'm really laughing! As she spoke, she hurriedly rolled up her sleeves to wipe her eyes, saying that the dust had obscured them. Second Madam Ye said, Cuizhen, now that you're back, half of the responsibility on my shoulders is gone. You're the best at taking care of patients. You know what the patient needs. You're like drilling into the patient's stomach. In the past, when my sister-in-law was sick, she liked you to come. She was greedy for not taking care of Cuizhen. Cuizhen smiled and said, That's what Second Aunt said!

Weicheng raised his face and smiled, Sister Cuizhen, how come you have a shoe on one foot and no shoe on the other? Cuizhen and Second Madam Ye noticed at the same time. Second Madam Ye said, Hey, what's going on? Cuizhen blushed and said, Ah, I don't know how. Probably I was scared and happy, and only single-mindedly wanted to meet Brother Cheng and Second Aunt. I didn't care about anything else. Only now do I realize that when Brother Huang put me down to walk a few steps, I limped. I only thought that the road was uneven. I never thought that in the devil's house, one foot was wearing shoes and the other was not. This is really a joke! Weicheng suddenly sat up and said, This is what you call being carried away by success! I often have this situation! Where are Cuizhen's shoes? Last time you were robbed by them, and a shoe fell at the door! Second Madam Ye gave Cuizhen a pair of Weicheng's old shoes from under the bed and asked her to wear them temporarily, while hurriedly telling Weicheng to lie down to avoid catching a cold. Then she asked what Cuizhen's situation was after being robbed. (203)
