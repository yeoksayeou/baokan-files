### The Battle for Kharkov: Germany Sends Reinforcements for a Counterattack; Soviets Claim to Have Secured Several Strongholds

Soviet Border, May 17 (Havas) – Observers analyze the situation in the Kharkov region as follows: The strength of the German resistance has exceeded the expectations of the Red Army. The achievements of the Red Army are limited to occupying about ten minor villages and towns. The strongholds of Belgorod and Kharkov are apparently still in German hands. The Soviets are using a large number of tanks in the battle, with hundreds of vehicles lost. The German army has launched an unprecedented fierce counterattack, while the Red Army is persistent, determined to win. The two sides are in a stalemate. In short, the importance of the battle in this area can be compared to the Battle of Verdun in 1916.

Berlin, May 18 (Domei) – The German High Command announced yesterday that after establishing a bridgehead on the central sector of the Eastern Front, German troops continued to advance and occupy a village under strong Soviet defense. German counterattacks south of Lake Ilmen were successful, and German advances on the north bank made progress. German artillery continued to fiercely bombard enemy military installations and armaments factories in Leningrad. An explosion and fire were observed at the Kirov factory.

Führer Headquarters, May 18 (Domei) – This afternoon’s German war report stated that the remaining enemy forces on the Kerch Peninsula, despite their desperate resistance, have no chance of survival. In the Kharkov region, our army’s counterattack included a fierce tank battle, in which 56 enemy tanks were destroyed, and another 50 were bombed by German aircraft, rendering them immobile. Around Lake Ilmen, German aircraft bombed enemy camps and supply columns. Our forces in the Lapland area have made advances. Hungarian forces routed the enemy in the enemy’s rear. German aircraft sank five large transport ships in the Murmansk area.

London, May 18 (Reuters) – London officials stated this afternoon that Marshal Timoshenko’s Soviet forces are currently attacking along a hundred-mile front in the Kharkov region. The Soviet attack line appears to arc from Volchansk (40 miles northeast of Kharkov), through Chuguev (15 miles southeast of Kharkov), to Krasnograd (50 miles southwest of Kharkov). The German side has deployed reserve forces for a counterattack. From the 15th to the 16th, our army advanced 20 to 30 kilometers, recovering 300 inhabited places. A Soviet Information Bureau communique stated that on the night of May 17, our forces launched an offensive on the Kharkov front. Heavy fighting continued throughout the night near the city of Kerch. No major events occurred in other areas of the front. A Soviet supplementary communique stated that our forces in the Kharkov area continued to advance despite German resistance. German attacks in the northwest Kalinin area were repulsed. There is guerrilla warfare in the rear of the German army on the Smolensk front. Moscow Radio broadcast that Marshal Timoshenko’s troops had captured several locations on the Kharkov front and contained the German counterattack. Many German tanks were destroyed.

### Japanese Forces in Burma Close in on the Indian Border; Imphal Continues to be Bombed

Tokyo, May 18 (Domei) – Observers here stated today that Japanese forces in Burma are advancing north along the Chindwin River and have cut off the retreat of 20,000 British troops in the Kale Valley area. This location is only 60 kilometers from the Indian border. If deemed necessary, the Japanese army is prepared to invade India at any time.

Rangoon, May 17 (Domei) – Japanese army aircraft flew over the Arakan Mountains at 11:00 AM on the 16th and bombed Imphal in the Indian state of Assam.

Saigon, May 18 (Domei) – According to news from Bombay, Gandhi opposes the scorched earth policy and advocates for vigorous defense. If it becomes necessary to abandon crops due to the inability to defend them, one must risk the enemy using those crops.

### Soviet Forces Encircle; Fierce Fighting Continues in Kerch

London, May 16 (Reuters) – According to front-line reports received from Moscow last night, Soviet troops have managed to land behind German forces on the Kerch Peninsula, and fierce fighting is still ongoing in that area.

Berlin, May 18 (Domei) – The German High Command issued the following war report, supplementing details of the annihilation of the remaining Soviet forces on the Kerch Peninsula, stating that German and Romanian forces are pressing on the remaining Soviet troops at the tip of the Kerch Peninsula. Although the Soviet troops are in a pincer encirclement, they are putting up a strong resistance. In the past two days, the Soviet troops have repeatedly attempted to break out of the encirclement, but have been defeated by German forces. In the Kerch battles, the Soviet army has continuously sacrificed manpower in large numbers, as the Soviet political commissars have ordered that no sacrifice be spared in the hope of breaking through the encirclement. A unit of Soviet troops landing on the Kerch Peninsula attempted to rescue the surrounded Soviet troops, but they themselves were also encircled. Therefore, the number of Soviet prisoners of war is increasing daily. A German engineer battalion near Bapaz unearthed as many as 15,000 Soviet-laid landmines in one day. The large number of landmines buried by the Soviet army demonstrates the strength of the Soviet defenses.

### Overview of the International Situation in the Past Week

Vichy, May 17 (Havas) – Among the fluctuations in the international situation, the past week has been the most intense. The most noteworthy event is Germany’s resumption of large-scale offensives on the Eastern Front. German forces began attacking Kerch, after months of relative quiet. The intensity has been exceptionally fierce. The next issue is the question of French territories in the Western Hemisphere. France received a U.S. note on the 15th of this month seeking to change the legal status of the French West Indies. This issue has not yet been resolved, and all parties are deeply anxious about the future of U.S.-French relations. The British occupation of Diego Suarez in Madagascar, with moral support from the United States, has aroused resentment in French public opinion. France is determined to defend its full sovereignty over its colonies and to adhere to the Franco-German armistice agreement without wavering. Negotiations are currently continuing on the basis of these conditions. Furthermore, Prime Minister Churchill’s speech on May 10, which touched on the issue of gas warfare, has provoked a serious reaction. In Eastern Europe, relations between Romania and Hungary have become strained. Romanian Prime Minister General Antonescu delivered a speech on May 14, openly demanding the return of Outer Transylvania. Turkey, on the other hand, remains neutral among the belligerent nations. German Ambassador to Turkey, von Papen, issued a written statement declaring that German military plans do not include Turkey. This is very important. Moreover, Pope Pius XII delivered a radio address on the 14th, calling for peace. In the Atlantic, a Mexican oil tanker was sunk by a submarine in the Gulf of Mexico, which may lead to that country’s involvement in the war.

### Fascist Party Convenes Supreme Council Meeting; Important Decisions Expected; Premier Tours Mediterranean Islands

### Cripps Delivers Speech

Bristol, England, May 17 (Havas) – Lord Privy Seal Sir Stafford Cripps delivered a speech here today, stating that there is no reason for optimism at present. He said, “Recently, I have seen the country filled with optimism. We have reasons for hope and confidence in the future, but we must not be overly optimistic. There is currently no reason for complacency. We must realize that only by making the greatest efforts can we achieve victory. Regarding my previous trip to India, I absolutely believe that once the current war is over, Britain is sincere in granting independence to India. Unfortunately, the Indian leaders did not see this and refused to accept it. However, this proposal will still be the basis for organizing the Indian government after the war. Furthermore, the general public has recently hoped to take the offensive. The government’s desire to explore this action is not behind anyone, but the difficulty lies in those who bear the responsibility of command, who cannot speak lightly at this time.”

### Turkish Air Force Commander Arrives in Cairo Yesterday

Although the island’s airfield is still in use, daily reports state that several aircraft are being destroyed on the ground. Britain has always regarded Malta as a major unsinkable aircraft carrier for attacking Italy and has long been preparing the airfield thoroughly. Even recently, Britain dispatched air forces from Gibraltar and Alexandria to reinforce it, but they were intercepted by German and Italian air forces, preventing them from reaching their destination. Even if aircraft manage to reach the island, they are still destroyed by Axis aircraft upon arrival. However, the strategic importance of Malta remains significant, and it is still a major stronghold in the current war.

Berlin, May 18 (Havas) – A radio station here recently broadcast that from May 8th to 15th, the British Air Force lost 79 aircraft over the Mediterranean.

The report stated that after being damaged by a British submarine, the ship was docked in Trondheim, Norway. Yesterday, our reconnaissance aircraft discovered it sailing south along the Norwegian coast, apparently intending to return to its home country for repairs. Upon receiving the report, our Coastal Command dispatched a squadron of aircraft, which sighted the ship near the southern tip of Norway at night and immediately attacked it. According to initial reports, the ship was hit by an aerial torpedo. At the time, the "Prinz Eugen" was being protected by four torpedo boats and several destroyers.

London, May 17 (Havas) – The Admiralty has recently issued a notice requesting people to turn in all foreign landscape photographs to the government authorities, as they may make a significant contribution to the British bombing of Germany and its occupied areas. According to an Admiralty spokesman, "A single photograph is more terrible than twenty tanks."

### Pope’s Call for Respect for Humanity Attracts World Attention

Vichy, May 17 (Havas) – The 25th anniversary of Pope Pius XII’s episcopate was marked on the 14th of this month. The Pope delivered a radio address to the world, calling on both sides of the warring nations to respect humanity, which has attracted the world's attention. In recent months, the Vatican newspaper "L'Osservatore Romano" has repeatedly published articles reviewing the Vatican’s responsibilities in the current situation, expressing that the Vatican does not wish to take sides with any of the warring nations, but will mediate as soon as the situation matures. The Vatican's neutral position is not only recognized by Roman Catholics, but also by other Christians.

All such shops with capital of 20,000 to 300,000 yuan are subject to closure, so it is estimated that the total capital of the closed shops is 3 million yuan.

### 明永曆皇太后等 信奉天主敎史料（下）

瞿公乃忠吿之曰，一人若不領洗入敎，死將罰入地獄，不因帝王而例外」。此數句質直之言，屬天籌一一轉吿皇太后。皇太后雖已心傾向領洗，而未有勇氣。天壽又懇懇進言，以鼓其發勉之心； 公則為之講解敎理，準備洗禮；永曆帝亦表示贊成，於是乃定期舉行聖洗典禮矣。

瞿 Gong, being loyal, advised, "If a person does not receive baptism into the Church, they will be punished and sent to hell after death, and there will be no exceptions even for emperors." These straightforward words were reported to the Empress Dowager in full by Tian Chou. Although the Empress Dowager was already inclined to be baptized, she did not have the courage. Tian Shou earnestly gave further advice to encourage her; Gong then explained the doctrines of the Church and prepared for the baptism; Emperor Yongli also expressed his approval, and so it was decided to hold the baptism ceremony on a set date.

### 本報特稿 七省反正 太子降生當此之時

(Yongli, Year Two,) the Ming Dynasty was flourishing. The lands of seven provinces, including Huguang, Jiangxi, Yunnan, and Guizhou, entered the territory of Yongli, holding half of China. And just as the Yongli heir was born, all blessings gathered, and the people rejoiced. Because of this, the Empress Dowager, the Empress, and others greatly increased their faith and deeply felt the great grace of God, earnestly requesting baptism from Father Zhai. Father Zhai, discerning their sincerity, performed the baptism ceremony in a small chapel within the palace, with the Christian officials all participating in the ceremony. The Emperor Yongli's stepmother, Empress Dowager Wang, took the Christian name Helena; his biological mother, Empress Dowager Ma, took the Christian name Maria; and Empress Wang took the Christian name Anna. The newborn heir was named Ci Xuan. Emperor Yongli initially did not permit him to be baptized, but shortly afterward, the heir fell critically ill. Yongli then granted permission, and he was given the Christian name Constantine. The priest named him with the hope that the heir would, in the future, be like the great Roman Emperor Constantine, leading his subjects to embrace Christianity, thereby recreating China. The heir's illness was cured immediately after his baptism.

According to the evidence held by Mr. Bo Xihe, based on the date of Father Qu's letters at the time, the baptism ceremony took place between March and April 1648, which was Yongli's second year. As for the location of the baptism, it was in Nanning, Guangxi, not Zhaoqing, as Yongli returned to Qian Guang after Li Dongchen's rebellion. The Xiao Tian Ji Nian, volume fifteen, page twenty-five, states: "In the eighth month of the second year of Yongli, he returned to reside there." Empress Wang Anna's baptism took place before the birth of the heir, and according to the Xiaotian Ji Nian, the Ming Ji Nan Lue, and the Xingzai Yangqiu, the heir was born on the first day of the fourth month, Bingyin, which corresponds to April 22nd in the Gregorian calendar. However, the Xingchao Lu records that he was born on the first day of the fourth month, Yiwei, which corresponds to May 1st in the Gregorian calendar, a difference of one month. The Xiaotian Ji Nian examines this and states: "The events of the first day of the fourth month, Yiwei, were obtained through hearsay by Zong Yide and are a mistake of one month." Before the birth of the heir, Prince Gui and others were in Nanning (from April 2nd to July 30th in the Gregorian calendar). Furthermore, Western history states that several days after the Empress Dowager's baptism, Father Gong would congratulate the Empress Dowager in advance, saying that the Imperial family would certainly receive the blessings of God. Sure enough, eight days later, the prediction was fulfilled, as seven provinces rebelled and returned to the authority of Prince Gui. The restoration of the seven provinces occurred on the tenth day of the fourth month, Yi Hai, (May 2nd), with Li Chen Dong's rebellion in Guangdong. Therefore, calculating based on the dates, the Imperial Palace was in Nanning at this time, and the heir was born on the first day of the fourth month, two joys following the Empress Dowager's baptism, precisely matching the blessings predicted by Father Zhai.

Sending an envoy to Macau, performing the Mass Ceremony
Once the imperial heir recovered from his illness, the Ming Dynasty's rebel generals who had surrendered to the Qing Dynasty successively revolted. Emperor Yongli, following the Empress Dowager's intentions, sent an envoy to Macau, requesting the performance of a grand Mass, firstly to express gratitude for the graces bestowed by God, and secondly to seek God's blessings for the Ming Dynasty. The envoy consisted of two Christian ministers, who arrived in Macau on October 17th of the first year of Yongli (1648). The Portuguese in Macau fired cannons in salute, and the Jesuits all lined up to welcome them. The envoy arrived at the Jesuit Church, piously prostrating themselves before God, and also presented the gifts they had brought: a pair of large, dragon-carved silver incense burners, for the purpose of burning incense to revere God; two pairs of silver vases with carved flowers, containing precious incense; and two pairs of silver candle holders with carved flowers, in the names of Emperor Yongli, the Empress Dowager, and the Empress, dedicated to the Jesuit Church. In addition to these gifts, there were also three silver vases, dedicated to the Jesuit Superior, the Provincial Superior of China, and the Rector of the Macau Monastery.

On October 21st, a grand Mass was held, presided over by the Supervising Priest. During the Mass, at the Offertory, the envoy went to the altar and respectfully offered the gifts. The ceremony was solemn, and the observers were moved. After the Mass, the Jesuits set up ten tables for a feast, to entertain the envoy. Before the envoy departed, the Jesuits and the Macau Christians presented them with many holy objects and rare Western items. The Portuguese Governor gifted them one hundred muskets to assist their military campaign.

The above account of Empress Dowager Yongli's conversion to Catholicism, its historical materials all taken from the records of the missionaries at the time, with not a single word mentioned in Chinese historical records. As for Qu Shi-si, Jiao Lian, and Pang Tian-shou's loyalty to the Ming Dynasty, they exhausted their efforts until death, and their virtues are sufficient to illuminate the ages, and to be a model for later generations. (The End)

The Ruins of St. Paul's, Macau The Ruins of St. Paul's in Macau stand tall and majestic on Sanba Street, rising over ten zhang in height, with images of four saints carved on its walls. It was originally the gate tower of the Sanba Temple. This church, built between 1505 and 1602 AD, served as the hub of Catholicism for China and Japan. Unfortunately, the entire church was destroyed by fire in 1825, leaving only the four walls. In 1838, three of the walls were demolished, leaving only the gate tower for tourists to view.

### Stolen Goods Already Reported Should Not Be Resold by Pawnshops

The home of Russian Shirmainov, located in Room 12, No. 651 Weihaiwei Road, was broken into by a Russian thief, Feiergaofu, in September of last year. The thief stole a set of silver decorative items and utensils worth over ten thousand yuan, as well as a diamond ring, and fled. Later, the thief pawned the stolen goods at the Hong'an Pawnshop, No. 742 Xiafei Road in the French Concession, for over seven hundred yuan. The Public Concession Police have now arrested the Russian thief, who confessed to the crime. The French Concession Police were notified and summoned Zhao Shande, the clerk of the Hong'an Pawnshop, to the police station for questioning. Zhao confessed that the stolen goods were sold to him by a Western woman and not pawned. He had already sold the stolen goods to an unknown person for over eight hundred yuan, and the original stolen goods could not be recovered. The police chief stated that the stolen goods had been reported, and a loss notice had been sent to all pawnshops. Zhao Shande, the clerk of Hong'an Pawnshop, had received this notice and should not have dared to sell the stolen goods. His actions were deliberately in violation of the regulations. The police chief ordered him to be detained for further investigation.

### Haifu and Moufu Ships Renamed and Resuming Service Haifu Renamed Wansheng After Repairs Completed Moufu Restoring its Original Names of Xinning and Shaoyuan

The Haifu ship, renamed Wansheng and its German flag replaced, entered the dock on the 6th of this month for inspection and hull repairs.

The route to be taken has not yet been determined and procedures are being processed. It will likely travel to Shenjiamen, Zhoushan. Once the procedures are completed, the resumption of service will be announced. The Ningshao Shipping Company's Xinning Shao ship, renamed Moufu after the August 12th Incident and flying the German flag, was detained in Zhoushan last year. Mr. Xu was appointed to negotiate with the Japanese side, and it has now been released and returned to Shanghai. These events were reported in previous editions. It is now known that the ship will resume service under the name Xinning Shao. As it has been out of service for a long time, it entered the dock for repairs last Saturday. Once the work is completed, the date for resumption of service will be set. The route it will take in the future has not yet been determined.

They negotiated with Zhang and prevented the sale. Zhang found himself in a dilemma. At the same time, the Far East Company insisted that the sales contract be fulfilled and accused Zhang of breaching the contract.

### A Visit to Two Daycare Centers Sponsored by the Young Women's Christian Association

Children are the future masters of the nation, so the importance of childcare cannot be ignored. The Shanghai Young Women's Christian Association (YWCA) has established two daycare centers to increase women's productivity and promote the daycare movement: the Shanghai Daycare Center and the Working Women's Daycare Center. Both facilities are well-equipped and well-managed, making a significant contribution to many innocent, lively children from impoverished families and women who are forced to work in order to make a living. To understand the content of these two daycare centers, the reporter made separate visits to observe them, and now I will briefly describe my impressions.

### Shanghai Daycare Center

The Shanghai Daycare Center is located at 66 Daxilu Road, not far from Dadulu Road. The building was originally a three-story private residence, so the courtyard is spacious, the buildings are large, the trees are lush, the air is fresh, and the environment is quite quiet. It is said that the daycare center was originally located in the building of Tongren Hospital at B37 Bailinan Road, where no rent was paid, and only 150 yuan was spent on water and electricity each month. After December 8th of last year, it was moved to its current location on Daxilu Road. Currently, the monthly rent is 700 yuan in legal tender, and the rent will increase to 1,200 yuan in savings certificates after June, making it difficult to bear the cost. The daycare center was established in March last year, and the annual budget at that time was only 40,000 yuan in legal tender. Since then, prices have continued to rise, making it very difficult to maintain the status quo. The YWCA authorities have also been reluctant to ask for donations from all walks of life. The original intention of the daycare center was to serve poor children, so it was completely free. Later, because children from middle and upper class families also requested foster care, a small number of fee-paying students were admitted, with a provisional monthly fee of 120 yuan. In this way, financial support could be slightly increased, and the daycare center movement would be easier to popularize. Currently, there are about 50 children, including fee-paying students, who are being fostered in the daycare center, most of whom are boys. They live in the daycare center full-time, and their ages range from one to four years old. The parents of the free children mostly belong to the working class, especially those who work in iron factories, silk factories, and sock factories. These children, because their parents have less knowledge and are unable to care for them while working outside the home, often spend their days confined to a room, not interacting with the outside world. As a result, their intellectual development is greatly affected. There are often children over the age of two who still cannot speak. However, when a doctor examines their vocal organs, there is no damage. This shows that heredity and environment are closely related to a child's intelligence. After they live in the daycare center, teachers teach them to speak, identify colors, and impart appropriate kindergarten education, and their progress is quite rapid. As for the clothes they wear, they are all provided by the daycare center, and only the shoes are sent by their parents. In terms of diet, there are four meals a day. The first meal is at 7:00 in the morning, with porridge, crackers, or homemade steamed buns. The second meal is at 11:30, with older children eating rice and younger children eating porridge. The dishes include eggs and pork liver, and vegetarian dishes include vegetables, potatoes, and pumpkin. They are rotated daily to vary the taste and cooked in appropriate ways to make them easy to digest. They take a nap from 12:30 to 2:00, and then have a snack at 3:30, mostly homemade soybean milk and broken crackers purchased from cracker factories. Dinner is from 6:00 to 7:00, with porridge, rice, or meat and bone soup noodles. In present-day Shanghai, diet has become a serious problem. Fortunately, the daycare center has applied to the Shanghai Municipal Council for the purchase of white rice and, to the extent possible, both considers the children's nutrition and strives to be economical. According to the current budget, each child spends about five jiao in legal tender each day on dishes. If there are people who are enthusiastic about childcare and are willing to sponsor a child, they only need to pay 30 yuan per month. Shanghai is not short of wealthy families, and this small amount can be said to be easy. The daycare center's building may have problems in the near future. If there are buildings with particularly low rents that can be rented to them, that is what the Shanghai Daycare Center is very much hoping for.

### Working Women's Daycare Center

The Working Women's Daycare Center is also sponsored by the YWCA and is located at No. 638 Weihaiwei Road. The daycare center was established in March of last year. Because working women are often worried about leaving their children at home while they are out of the office, only daytime childcare was provided at the beginning, from morning until 5:30 in the afternoon. At that time, it was still of an experimental nature, and there were only five children admitted. Later, the number gradually increased, showing that there was indeed a need for it in society. The number of places was then expanded, and lodging was also provided. The daycare center's children are not allowed to be over four years old. In February of this year, a kindergarten was also established to provide appropriate kindergarten education for children who continue to be in the daycare center. Currently, there are a total of 52 children in the daycare center, including 18 boys and 24 girls. Among all the children, 24 live in the daycare center, and the rest are picked up by their parents in the evening. The family circumstances of these children are either because their parents are not complete and lack caregivers, or because of family financial circumstances and they cannot afford to hire adequate servants, or because their parents have many children and are difficult to care for, or because their mothers are in childbirth and have to temporarily foster their children. As long as the child is under the age of four, has been examined by a doctor and proven to be healthy, has a guarantee, and pays the prescribed fee, they can be admitted to the daycare center. The current monthly fee for daytime childcare is 64 yuan, and 31 yuan for those who receive a reduction. The monthly fee for children who live in the daycare center is 120 yuan, and 88 yuan for those who receive a reduction. This fee includes meals, laundry, towels, soap, medicine, educational supplies, and everything else. Based on current prices, this is only enough to cover rice, childcare costs, and a portion of the food, and staff salaries must be covered by donations.

According to the reporter's observations, the YWCA's establishment of these two daycare centers has been a painstaking effort, both materially and spiritually. The perseverance of the staff is worthy of respect. In the current isolated island environment, most people only know how to "cleverly seize and plunder," and do not know what it means to serve society. This kind of childcare that is related to the future of the nation should be supported for its development. This will not only improve family happiness but also benefit society greatly. (Zhen)

### Yarn Soars Like a Falcon, Fluctuating Unpredictably

Cotton yarn market conditions: spot prices have been soaring continuously, causing bulls to take profits and sell off, and the market initially rose and then softened. 42-count Blue Phoenix was priced at 16,050 yuan to 16,200 yuan, with a closing price of 16,000 yuan. 42-count Immortal Peach was priced at 15,150 yuan to 14,950 yuan. 41-count Yanghe was priced at 15,400 yuan. 60-count Five Sons was priced at 25,500 yuan. 80-count Color Ball was priced at 40,000 yuan. 40-count Golden Bridge was priced at 13,800 yuan. 20-count Blue Phoenix was priced at 9,200 yuan to 9,000 yuan. 20-count Moon Zero was priced at 8,400 yuan. 20-count Double Earth was priced at 8,200 yuan to 8,045 yuan. 20-count Double Horse was priced at 8,000 yuan to 8,150 yuan, closing at 8,000 yuan to 7,950 yuan. 20-count Blue Phoenix spot was priced at 8,500 yuan. 16-count Red Kui Star was priced at 7,930 yuan. 20-count Heavenly Girl was priced at 7,800 yuan to 8,030 yuan. 20-count Great Joy was priced at 8,200 yuan. 20-count Special Golden City was priced at 8,000 yuan. 10-count Red Double Horse was priced at 6,650 yuan to 6,550 yuan. 10-count Boy Scout was priced at 6,550 yuan to 6,150 yuan. 10-count Red Bao Yi was priced at 6,450 yuan to 6,250 yuan. The opening price of 20-count Double Horse factory single was 6,000 yuan, but it soon fell to 5,870 yuan. It was then heard that the spot goods were good, and gradually rose to a closing price of 6,210 yuan. However, after the close, it was heard that the yarn price had fallen back, and it then plummeted to 5,900 yuan. In the afternoon, due to the rise in the leading cloth, the price also rose. Currently, the yarn market is enthusiastic among speculators, jumping for a week in a row. The spot price of 20-count Double Horse has soared by 1,700 yuan, and the 10-count Red Double Horse has risen by 1,850 yuan. If there is a reaction in the future, there may be a drastic change. In addition, the price of 20-count yarn in other ports is around 7,500 or 7,600 yuan. Compared with the scheduled price, the difference is too far, so the actual demand needs to be completely suspended.

### Eastern Piece Exceeds Expectations, the More It Rises, the More People Buy, the Ups and Downs of Leading Products Are Shocking, Surpassing the Four Gentlemen

Yesterday, due to the sharp rise in Eastern Piece, the cloth market continued to rise. 16-pound Earth coarse cloth was priced at 271 yuan, and Flying Goose was priced at 262 yuan, an increase of 45 yuan per piece compared to Saturday. 12-pound Earth fine cloth was priced at 245 yuan, and Fugui was priced at 242 yuan, an increase of about 5 to 7 yuan. Peach Blossom Lady Lin's highest price was 370 yuan, an increase of 8 yuan. Longevity Silk was priced at 7 yuan 8 and a half jiao. Volleyball yarn silk was quoted at 5 yuan 9 jiao to 6 yuan, also an increase of 1 or 2 jiao.

Outside the industry, hoarders of Eastern cloth buy more as the price rises, and the gap between factory orders and spot goods is also widening. Market transactions have become completely speculative. The leading fine cloth opened in the morning at 302 yuan, and the highest price reached 320 yuan, a difference of as much as 18 yuan per piece, and the range of ups and downs was truly shocking. The reason is that when it opened in the morning, the price of Double Horse yarn fell back, and the new order for the leading product opened at 302 yuan, and the situation was still soft, but soon after, many bulls outside the industry came to frantically drag the price up, raising the noon closing price to 32 yuan. In the afternoon, it started at 310 yuan, rose to a high of 320 yuan, then fell back to 314 and a half yuan, and after the close, it rose again to 315 and a half yuan, an increase of 12 yuan per piece. However, the bank order for the leading product was only 265 yuan, and the spot goods on the floor had to be 5 to 10 yuan less before they could be easily sold, which is really puzzling. Furthermore, the red single trading of the Four Gentlemen serge is more active than the leading product, rising and falling suddenly, with thousands of changes. Yesterday morning, the opening price was 10 yuan 005 points, which quickly rose to 10 yuan 03 jiao, then returned to 10 yuan 02 jiao. The noon closing price was as high as 10 yuan 04 jiao 2 fen. The after-market started at 10 yuan 03 jiao 7 points, fell to 10 yuan 02 jiao, and the highest peak reached 10 yuan 08 jiao and a half, then fell to 10 yuan 06 jiao and a half, and the closing price was shouted at 10 yuan 07 jiao, with buyers, about 5 and a half jiao higher than last week's market price.

### Government Bonds Market: Stormy Weather, Types C and E Fall by Four Yuan, Hitting the Limit, with Unprecedented Rapid Fluctuations

The government bond grey market continued to plummet yesterday. Types C and E each fell by more than four yuan and hit the limit. Type E even broke the 50 yuan mark, and Type D also broke the 50 yuan mark, seeing a low price of 48 and a half yuan. The tragic decline made people unable to predict it. It is like a beautiful flower being destroyed by wind and rain, but fortunately, there are still people who know how to cultivate it. However, no one knows when the storm will end. It must wait until the wind stops and the rain clears before the clouds disperse and the sun shines. Yesterday, Tongli sold about 2 million yuan, and Hu Heji and Dakangcheng also sold 500,000 yuan. The rest were Tongkang, Jiufeng, Tongyuan, Lianhe, and general scalping transactions. Tongshun bought the most, with nearly 1 million yuan. Next was Qianyi, which also took in a lot. Hengyu, Zhenhua, and Zhongyi were also quite strong. The rest were Chengkang, Lianyi, Yuanhe, Xinji, Huichang, Runde, Shunli Dechang, and general retail investors buying in. The atmosphere was tense, the market was crowded, the competition was fierce, and the rapid fluctuations in market prices were unprecedented. Currently, it is still in the midst of wind and rain. The market price results were unanimously down sharply, with Types C and E each down four yuan, and the rest down from one yuan two jiao to three yuan one jiao. The transaction volume was about 3.12 million yuan. The list is briefly shown below: Category Highest Lowest Closing Compared to Previous Day Tongjia 61.75 59.50 61.70 Down 1.3 Tongyi 55.40 51.50 53.0 Down 3.10 Tongbing 6.0 2.20 12.2 Down 4.0 Tongding 51.5 48.50 50.0 Down 2.0 Tonge 52.3 49.50 49.5 Down 4.0

Cash Has No Major Changes

The cash market continued to rise, continuing the upward trend of the weekend, but there were those who wanted to sell to obtain cash, resulting in the daily fluctuations still being small, and people's hearts were quite stable. It started high at 400 yuan in the morning, totaling 21,600 yuan, and was dragged in by retail investors, rising to 21,700 yuan. Due to tight money supply, a certain money shop, silver shop, and securities firm sold, gradually falling to 21,500 yuan. The Jin Gang was inconsistent in its inflow and outflow, with the cash shop and a certain gang paying less, raising it to 21,650 yuan. A certain silver shop still sold, and the final transaction price was 21,600 yuan, 400 yuan higher than last Saturday's price, with a difference of 200 yuan. It rose to 21,700 yuan after the close, and the transaction was still active.

The goldsmith shops and jewelry shops initially raised the price of gold by 50 yuan per tael, totaling 2,250 yuan, but immediately returned to a flat price of 2,200 yuan (with a reduction of 200 yuan for purchases). Silver was priced at 18 yuan, and the black market price was 15 yuan 67 jiao. A silver coin was priced at 9 yuan 45 jiao.

The interest rate for the Money Industry Association's discount was 1 jiao and 5 fen. The discount rate for head-cut bills, per thousand yuan, rose from around 30 yuan to as high as 52 yuan and 47 yuan, an increase of 17 yuan. The premium for reserve tickets was, at most, 4 jiao and 2 fen per yuan, then 3 jiao and 7 fen.

Paper Money: Spot Money Is Hoarded. Although the price of foreign rice has increased, and the unit for buying rice has increased, the supply of spot money has not yet been plentiful and is still being hoarded. However, a major tool has been lost. Those who buy and sell with currency are never idle, so they have turned to paper money, which has been quiet for a long time. There have been many rumors in recent days, and it has already seen a slight rise yesterday. At a time when prices are soaring, the cost of living is increasing, and livelihoods are shrinking, in order to take care of the overall situation and preserve vitality, it is advisable not to pick and choose again and again.

Miscellaneous Grains Arrive and Sell in Small Quantities

Bean Market Conditions: There were no major changes yesterday. Arrivals and sales were all in small quantities. Supply and demand were still balanced, and the market trend was slightly upward.

Spring and Autumn

Words of Zi

### A New Fable, Part One

— Ge Liang

In a remote place, two mice met. After a brief greeting, they got straight to the point. "Does your landlord have rice?" "No!" "My house doesn't either. Last night, I searched for six hours before finding a single grain." "This is what they call 'every grain is hard-earned'." "So I deliberately bite the landlord's utensils and clothes, making holes in every piece of clothing." "Liu Zihou's room has no intact utensils, and his clothes are not intact. His diet mostly consists of what the mice leave behind," this is what it means." "Why haven't I seen you for three days, and I don't understand a word you're saying? What are you taking from your landlord's house for food?" "Books. Because my landlord's house is bare, except for books, there's nothing else. So I eat books for three meals a day." "No wonder you look so shabby. But I heard people say that books are useless... what? I advise you, it's better to eat fewer books." "The east wind wrinkles a pool of spring water, what's it to you?" "So what do books taste like?" "There's a taste like meat in books. Speaking of meat, let me tell you: my landlord is always either shouting that he hasn't tasted meat for three months, or chanting about going home to eat meat, and now he suddenly wants to eat mouse meat, it's really wishful thinking." "People eat mouse meat? I've never heard of it." "You're really making a fuss over nothing! To examine historical facts, digging up rats and netting sparrows, there was Su Wu in the Han Dynasty, and Zhang Xun in the Tang Dynasty. Last night, he held a knife waiting, and as soon as he saw me, he walked towards me, so I took the best of the Thirty-Six Strategies, clutched my head and scurried away, escaping without a trace." "Hmm!"

### A Record of Laughter

A: "Look, the third-class carriage is empty, but those people insist on squeezing into the first-class carriage, where they can't even stand up straight." B: "That's because people love crowds!"

### A Good Comparison

Stepping into the photo studio, I was irritated by the crowd of people. I went to have a two-and-a-half-inch photo taken for my graduation certificate, which was said to be available in four days. Okay, four days it is. But now it's the sixth day.

As usual, I squeezed in and gave the clerk my photo receipt.

"Two or three more days." Heavens, two or three more days! "How is it possible that taking a two-inch photo takes nine days? In the past, a half-dozen registration photos cost at most five or six jiao, and they were available the next day. Now it costs four yuan to take only four photos, why do you need two or three more days?" I said angrily.

"Isn't it so? In the past, a dan of rice could be bought for a dozen yuan, and it could be delivered to your door. Now, half a liter of rice costs five yuan, and you have to wait in line in the middle of the night to get it, and whether you can buy it is still a question. Two or three more days, it's two or three more days, like milling rice, please come and run another trip in two or three days."

I could only give the humorous clerk a wry smile.

### About Puppet Shows

— Man Shan

Speaking of puppets, they were invented quite early in China. I remember that when Emperor Gaozu of Han, Liu Bang, was trapped in Baideng City, his strategist Chen Ping knew that Modun's wife was jealous, so he used a wooden sculpture of a beautiful woman to force the henpecked general away. As for puppet shows, I could still see them in my childhood. They were many wooden puppets less than a foot long, with various masks hanging outside, performed by an actor who put two fingers in the clothes. After one came on stage, explained things clearly, and was inserted on the edge of the stage of less than three feet square, then the second one came back to the same method. The lines of the characters were all handled by the person behind the scenes, which seemed to be very laborious. At that time, hiring him for half a day only cost a few jiao. People who made a living in this line were all wandering friends, and now speaking of it, they should be considered directors.

The above is what I remembered after seeing the news that the "Shanghai Puppet Theater Troupe" was established. Times have changed, and there has been significant progress in the manufacture of puppets. According to reports, "Not only can they dance to the rhythm of the music, but their eyes can also open and close as needed according to the environment, and their lips can also move like living beings when speaking." I heard that the director is Ge Tuolin, a famous German film director, and many Jewish experts are involved. Although I have not witnessed the performance, it must be much better than the wandering friends—that is, more realistic.

In fact, more than ten years ago, wasn't there a lot of fancy stages in the Six Horse Road area? They could not only perform joke dramas such as "The Emperor's Night Out," but also handle the three volumes of "Iron Rooster" with real knives and guns with ease. Now, repeating the old tune, it feels novel again. This is like after the automobile is eliminated, the bicycle also comes into the limelight, it is truly a case of "one time is one time."

### Zongtang Zeng's Good Words in a Chaotic World

— Lin Lu

In this chaotic world, even great wealth and high status are unreliable. Only diligence and thrift can last.

Although the body is weak, in times of great difficulty, if one can endure the hardships of wind and frost, and work hard with a troubled mind, one will naturally strengthen one's bones and lengthen one's knowledge.

In this chaotic world, to have a period of leisure is extremely difficult, so never miss such good times.

In this chaotic world, the less money one has, the more one can avoid disaster. The less one spends, the longer one can last.

Do not exhaust your blessings, do not exhaust your power. (Yet rewarded)

### The Lamp Thief

— Lou Jianhua

Probably because the times are extraordinary, the brains of ordinary people have also developed accordingly. Almost no method of making money is overlooked. Recently, every time the dawn is slightly bright, I am always awakened by bursts of noise. At first, I didn't pay attention to it, but today I heard the crying and commotion of the alleyway mom, and I learned that the light bulbs in the alley were stolen. The power poles in our alley are at least three zhang tall, and I heard that they were guarded until after two o'clock last night. Our alley is very long, estimated to have one to thirty light bulbs. For four consecutive days, the number is indeed considerable. I think that since the lamp thief has superb skills, he must want to make a big splash. Alleyway people who have not been patronized should pay special attention to this intangible loss. (Yet rewarded)

### Sharing the Same Boat in Wind and Rain

(5) Repay Kindness with Kindness

Wei Cheng really couldn't say a word, he just held Guo Qi's hand tightly and nodded to Guo Fang. Guo Qi said, "It's really unexpected. In just a month of separation, the changes in personnel have reached this point." Wei Cheng said, "Isn't it so?" While speaking, he led them to a room west of Madam Ye's bedroom. The relatives and friends of the Ye family were eating and drinking happily. One person turned his face to look, and then everyone turned their faces to look, whispering, "Who are this man and woman? Young Master Ye personally welcomed them out. They must not be ordinary people."

Arriving in that room, Wei Cheng hung their brother and sister's coats on the coat rack. A magpie rushed in and called, "Miss Chen, you've finally come today. Miss Cui Zhen and us have all been thinking about Miss Chen." Guo Fang smiled at the magpie and said, "Magpie, thank you. You must have been very busy these few days, right?" Wei Cheng said, "You brother and sister sit down. Guo Fang, don't be perfunctory with the magpie. Are you coming from Shanghai, or from Shuangqiao?" Guo Fang suddenly waved to the doorway and said, "Sister Cui Zhen, come!" Guo Qi and Wei Cheng turned to look and saw Cui Zhen with a white cloth cheongsam draped over her shoulders, her head was sticking in, and her feet were still outside. Called by Guo Fang, she walked into the room shamedly and said, "Miss Chen, please sit. Is this Mr. Chen?" Guo Fang hurried up and shook her hand, saying, "This is my brother. Brother, this is Sister Cui Zhen. She is the only general manager of internal affairs at Mr. Ye's residence."

Guo Qi, Guo Fang, Wei Cheng, and Cui Zhen all sat down casually. This room was originally planned by Wei Cheng to be used as a female guest reception room, so the room inside was the female guest bedroom. Guo Qi smiled and said, "My sister has only been here once, but she's much more familiar than I am. The last time my sister came here, I was sick. Later, when she returned to Shuangqiao, she said that Wei Cheng had suffered a great misfortune. We brother and sister truly lamented, and we all cursed that the heavens were ignorant. At that time, I wanted my sister to accompany me to comfort you, but my grandmother refused, firstly because my illness had not recovered, and secondly because she said that my monthly building was unfavorable, and I should not go to a funeral home this month." Wei Cheng said, "Later, it was the start of school, and you all had to go back to Shanghai." Guo Qi said, "Yes, we went to Shanghai, and we've been attending classes for a week."
