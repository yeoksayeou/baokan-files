### Thrift

Thrift, as the ancient Chinese saying goes, has always been valued. Especially since the Song Dynasty, due to the nation's difficult circumstances, a trend of thrift prevailed for a time. However, powerful officials like Jia Sidao, under various beautiful names, still made fortunes from the nation's distress, extensively managing fertile fields, beautiful ponds, concubines, and subordinates. As a result, the thrift movement advocated by Song Dynasty Confucians did not achieve much effect. Because the money of the powerful officials, even a penny or half a penny, came from the common people. It is an inevitable truth that officials grow rich while the people grow poor. When there are big figures above with insatiable desires, there will inevitably be common people below who have no food, no clothing, and no homes to return to.

Our current emphasis on thrift is not merely the individualistic meaning of "frugality leads to wealth" as advocated by Master Zhu Xi, but is based on the demands of the current era and the people. We know that the current war is heading towards a long-term war, and future hardships should not be taken lightly. Our friendly neighbor, Japan, regardless of the government or the public, has already embarked on a path of extreme thrift and struggle. The simplicity of their material life is probably unimaginable for people living in Shanghai. We talk about "cooperation" every day, and we shout "strive for shared hardship today in order to share the sweetness in later years." But what exactly have we "cooperated" on? What exactly have we "shared the hardship" on? If we examine ourselves, will we feel a little ashamed? We must know that today, every bit of waste in our personal lives and our political and economic facilities increases the burden on the people, diminishes the nation's vitality, and reduces the "total strength" in the Greater East Asia War. Our advocacy of thrift comes from this standpoint and perspective.

Regarding thrift, various parties have offered many valuable opinions. We believe the most important are: First, the government must establish a comprehensive thrift plan. On the one hand, it should launch a broad thrift movement among the people. On the other hand, and more importantly, it must lead by example, starting from every civil and military official, down to organizations and groups at all levels, rigorously practicing thrift. The important points are: (1) Implement a rigorous thrift supervision system for senior and mid-level civil servants, using the ability to truly practice thrift as one of the criteria for rewards and punishments. At the same time, rigorously enforce the anti-corruption movement, revitalize officialdom, and severely punish anyone who illegally or uses political power for private business, without leniency. (2) Strive to simplify administrative structures and personnel organizations at all levels, so that the least amount of manpower can handle the most public affairs. Do not allow kinship organizations, emotional organizations, or private groups with charitable relief characteristics to be tolerated within government agencies and groups. (3) Make every effort to reduce redundant staff, increase the salaries of necessary civil servants, so that they can work with peace of mind and increase administrative efficiency. (4) As much as possible, hold fewer unnecessary conferences, implement fewer laws that only cause hardship to our people, and conscript fewer corv√©e labors that only consume manpower and do not contribute to politics. All of these are for the purpose of saving the people's strength, preserving vitality, and cooperating in striving for victory in the Greater East Asia War.

Second, in society, we must find ways to encourage the people's voluntary and active thrift movement. Originally, for the general middle and lower class people, they have already been thrifty these past few years, as much as they can. We really can't bear to talk to the middle and lower classes about thrift anymore. What we ask of society is the general middle and upper class people, especially those who have made a fortune during the national crisis, to remember that their ill-gotten wealth is nothing more than the blood and sweat of their compatriots. Even if they don't take it out to dedicate to the nation and society, they shouldn't squander it like dirt. First of all, do not passively spend it on personal selfish pleasures, such as visiting prostitutes and gambling. Know that such consumption will only increase social panic and unrest, and will only accelerate your own decline and failure. Secondly, do not engage in speculative activities, because making a fortune through speculation is like a fleeting flash of lightning, gone in an instant, while the harm left to society and the country cannot be ignored. We hope that everyone will invest their capital in productive enterprises. On the one hand, it can guarantee the increase of their own wealth, and on the other hand, it can absorb the poor masses to some extent, reduce some of the crises in society, and actively increase materials, contributing to the Greater East Asia War.

Today's thrift has such great significance. We sincerely hope that all parties in the government and the public will work together to promote its realization.

### After the Meeting of Ambassadors and Consuls-General, Ambassador Shigemitsu Returned to Japan Yesterday to Liaise with the Tokyo Authorities, Sino-Japanese Cooperation Enters a New Stage

Nanjing, 19th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Ambassadors and Consuls-General meeting in China has concluded successfully on the 18th. Ambassador Shigemitsu returned to his country to report on the meeting and took a flight back to Japan at 10:00 AM on the 19th.

Tokyo, 19th (Central News Agency) - According to a Fukuoka telephone report, Japanese Ambassador to China, Shigemitsu Aoi, arrived in Fukuoka by plane at 1:48 PM today from Nanjing. He is scheduled to fly to Tokyo tomorrow. According to Ambassador Shigemitsu's statement to reporters after disembarking, the results of the meeting of ambassadors and consuls-general held in Nanjing have clarified various matters under the jurisdiction of the embassy. He is returning to the country for liaison with the central government and will return to his post after completing his duties.

Nanjing, 19th (Domei News Agency) - Qualified observers here today criticized Ambassador Shigemitsu's visit to Tokyo immediately after the conclusion of the Japanese ministers and consuls-general meeting in China yesterday, stating that the issue of closer Sino-Japanese cooperation and the formulation of more concrete plans for handling the China issue will enter a completely new stage. After Ambassador Shigemitsu returns to Nanjing, the ways in which Japan will take in China policy, and how to continue to enhance the power of the National Government are worthy of attention. The meeting that ended yesterday was the first since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, which is of great significance. It is still recalled that Ambassador Shigemitsu, after his last visit to Tokyo to discuss with the government, army, and navy authorities, expressed his firm determination to solve all problems in China. After Ambassador Shigemitsu returned to Nanjing on December 2, he immediately convened a meeting of Japanese ministers and consuls-general in China to inform them of the central government's recent China policy. This matter is also of profound significance. According to reports, Ambassador Shigemitsu departed from Nanjing Airport at 10:10 this morning to report everything to the Tokyo authorities.

### The Japanese Army Air Force in South China Repeatedly Inflicts Damage on the U.S. Air Force Stationed in Chongqing; 28 U.S. Aircraft Damaged in January; the U.S. Air Force's Guerrilla Warfare is Completely Contained

A certain air base of the Japanese Army in South China, 19th (Domei News Agency) - A review of the war situation of the Japanese Army Air Force stationed at this base in South China over the past two months reveals that the Imperial Air Force has completely restrained the guerrilla tactics of the U.S. Air Force stationed in Chongqing. The indiscriminate bombing of Hong Kong by U.S. aircraft on October 15 indicates that the U.S. pilots have adopted guerrilla methods in the hope of cutting off the transportation between the front and rear lines of the Japanese Air Force. During that attack, the Japanese Air Force at this base shot down two North American B-25 bombers and scattered the remaining U.S. aircraft. On October 18, the U.S. attempted to attack Hong Kong three times but retreated after losing one Curtiss P-40 fighter. They then turned to North China, bombed Linyi, dropped a small number of bombs, and lost three Consolidated B-24 bombers. The Japanese Air Force then counterattacked. On November 2, a large formation of bombers and fighters from this base suddenly attacked Guilin Airport in dense fog, engaging twelve P-40 enemy fighters, shooting down three, while Japanese bombers systematically destroyed nine aircraft parked on the airfield. The Japanese aircraft did not suffer any major damage and returned safely to this base. On December 12, Japanese aircraft attacked Guilin and Lingling twice, shooting down four Curtiss P-40 U.S. aircraft in aerial combat. Three U.S. fighters on the ground were destroyed and three were damaged. The Japanese aircraft did not lose a single plane. On November 24, U.S. aircraft attempted to counterattack, flying close to Guangzhou, but were intercepted by Japanese aircraft, losing a Curtiss P-40 (sic) before fleeing. In the month since the U.S. Air Force began to launch attacks again, this air force has shot down 2 North American aircraft, 9 Curtiss P-40s, and destroyed 17 other enemy aircraft. The final stage of the aerial combat began this month. The Japanese Air Force detected that U.S. aircraft would launch a large-scale attack on the first anniversary of the war, namely December 8. Therefore, they preemptively launched a series of fierce attacks on the U.S. aircraft's forward bases from December 6 to 8, such as Guilin, Yushan, and Ganzhou airports. The runways were destroyed, hangars caught fire, and other aviation facilities were temporarily out of use.

### War Results of the Japanese Army Between Jiangsu and Shandong

A certain Japanese army unit in the Hongze Lake area, 19th (Domei News Agency) - During the past month, the Japanese army has launched military operations in the areas surrounding Hongze Lake on the border of Jiangsu and Anhui, inflicting military damage on the Communist army. The Communist army suffered 1059 dead and 166 captured. This has greatly impacted the large-scale "pacification" movement in the area and the rapid advancement of agriculture. The Japanese army also seized a considerable amount of spoils of war, including 2 mortars, 3 machine guns, 843 rifles. In addition, they destroyed five military facilities, two training stations, three weapon factories, and two military uniform stations. Nanjing, 19th (Domei News Agency) - According to news from here today, the Communist army in eastern Shandong is currently under a fierce attack by the Japanese army in the snow and is about to collapse completely. The Communist army attempted to counterattack by laying mines and infiltrating the rear of the Japanese army, trying to hinder the Japanese army's sweeping offensive, but to no avail. They were forced to retreat to the jagged mountain area and were repeatedly hit hard. This military operation by the Japanese army is part of the fifth "pacification" campaign launched in North China against the Hebei-Shandong-Shanxi Red Army since October. The work of reconstruction in Hebei province has made great progress after the Japanese army's conquest.

### Representatives Appointed to Attend the Judicial Conference

Nanjing, 19th (Central News Agency) - The Ministry of Judicial Administration is preparing to convene a National Judicial and Administrative Conference.

### Developing Afforestation Efforts, Forming Forest Protection Corps

Nanjing, 19th (Central News Agency) - Afforestation is one of the basic industries for construction. At a time when timber and fuel are scarce, active afforestation is an urgent task at present. However, planting trees without protection still offers no hope for the formation of forests. For over twenty years, our country has been engaged in forestry, but without significant results. This is because the protection of forests has not been thorough enough. Since the war, illegal logging and destruction have been even more severe than before. Few timbers have survived, which is extremely distressing. In order to promote the future development of forestry and meet the actual needs, the military has formulated the Provisional Regulations on Forest Protection, which have been approved by the National Government for promulgation and implementation. It has also ordered the forestry demonstration farms to follow them. Now, during the winter pruning season for trees at each farm, and during the nurturing period for newly planted trees and wild trees, forest protection zones should be delineated within the forested areas in accordance with the regulations. Supervise the people to form forest protection corps in accordance with the protection application system, in order to provide thorough protection. The organization should be completed within one month, without any delay.

### German and Soviet Troops Engage in Hand-to-Hand Combat in the Terek Region; Germans Continue to Make Progress in the Don River Pocket; Soviets Launch Counter-Offensive in the Rzhev Region

German F√ºhrer Headquarters, 19th (Haitong News Agency) - This afternoon's German war report stated that the Soviet troops attacking in the German Terek, Stalingrad, and Don River regions have suffered heavy losses and retreated without success. In the Terek region, our army engaged in fierce hand-to-hand combat with the enemy, driving them back and capturing 420 enemy soldiers. Our army seized a large amount of enemy ordnance. The German-Romanian allied forces between the Don River and the Volga River forced the enemy to retreat northeast. Several Soviet counter-offensives were repulsed, with 22 Zhuk tank cars destroyed. The enemy troops attacking in Stalingrad and the Don River pocket were all repulsed. The elite forces on the Don River continue to advance, with German and Italian troops, air force, and anti-aircraft units cooperating effectively. The enemy suffered heavy losses. In one area, the Soviet army lost 50 tanks. The Soviet troops attacking in the central and northern routes were all repulsed. Our commando units destroyed many enemy bunkers in Kondalaksha.

### The British Eighth Army in Cyrenaica Engages in Fierce Fighting with Axis Forces; German Troops Break Through the Encirclement of Mont Gaudat; the British Pincer Movement Has Failed

Stockholm, Sweden, 19th (Haitong News Agency) - According to London sources, the British Eighth Army will engage in new fierce fighting with Axis forces in Cyrenaica within a few days. According to the British Eighth Army Command, the strategy in the area of Wadi Matratin has not been realized, and it is reported that the German Afrika Korps has now broken through the encirclement of Mont Gaudat and is currently fighting westward along the coast. British newspapers even admit that the British pincer movement has failed.

Bern, Switzerland, 18th (Havas News Agency) - According to Berlin sources, General Rommel's forces may launch a counter-offensive against the British Eighth Army in the near future. At the same time, the German side firmly denies the claims made by the British and Americans that some German units have been surrounded in Cyrenaica. They state that in Tunisia and Cyrenaica, the Axis forces still hold the initiative, mainly because the Germans and Italians enjoy air superiority. At the same time, news from London today is not as enthusiastic as yesterday. Although British newspapers report a major victory at Mont Gaudat, they all warn readers not to be overly optimistic and state that the mobile warfare in Cyrenaica is still in progress and the outcome is still difficult to predict. Furthermore, the Axis forces have recently shortened their transportation lines on both the eastern and western fronts in North Africa, which is very beneficial to them, and they have many airfields to use. This is true not only in North Africa, but also in Sicily, where there are many airfields. For the Allied forces, the opposite is true, and they are deeply troubled by the excessive length of their lines of communication. As for the situation in Tunisia, neither the British nor the Germans have made any clear statements. However, the German side announced that German troops had occupied several important positions on the border between Algeria and Tunisia yesterday.

Berlin, 19th (Haitong News Agency) - Responsible military officials here revealed that German combat units attacked the port of Tobruk last night, and a large merchant ship near Benghazi was heavily damaged by bombing.

Rome, 19th (Haitong News Agency) - An Italian military headquarters communiqu√© this afternoon stated that Axis forces are advancing in the Sirt region according to plan. After the British army lost 21 tanks yesterday, it did not attempt to advance further in the area. In Tunisia, enemy forces concentrated in the El BƒÅb area were bombed by our aircraft. German aircraft shot down ten enemy aircraft in the central Mediterranean, and Italian aircraft shot down four enemy aircraft. The Sousse area in Tunisia was also bombed by enemy aircraft, and non-military buildings suffered slight damage. 37 civilians were killed. Our anti-aircraft guns shot down four enemy aircraft.

### Reports of British Prime Minister Going to the United States are Pure Fabrication; U.S. President Denies Them

Stockholm, Sweden, 19th (Central News Agency) - According to reports from here on the 18th, the Swedish newspaper printed on the 18th that British Prime Minister Churchill would be visiting Washington. U.S. President Roosevelt denied the rumours from Lisbon. Roosevelt said when meeting with the press that the report was fabricated.

Bern, Switzerland, 18th (Havas News Agency) London: According to an unconfirmed report, British Prime Minister Churchill flew to the United States yesterday. Although this news was not officially released, according to reliable sources, Churchill stated at a secret meeting of the House of Commons a few days ago that he would go to the United States to discuss various issues in North Africa with President Roosevelt, and would discuss the relationship between the Allies and Darlan. British officials neither denied nor confirmed the rumor.

### Rumor that the Vichy Government Decided to Move Back to Paris Next Year; P√©tain Will Broadcast on Christmas Day

Bern, Switzerland, 19th (Domei News Agency) - According to news from Paris, the Vichy government has decided to move back to Paris. According to sources in Paris, the relocation date is around the 15th of next month, but others believe that it will be delayed until March of next year. At that time, Marshal P√©tain will work in the former Presidential Palace, and the ministers will work in their original ministry offices.

Berlin, 19th (Haitong News Agency) - According to German political circles, the state of armistice between Germany and France was established long ago, but the work of politically eliminating the war still requires effort. Germany is currently considering increasing the relations between European countries, so France's position depends not only on the relationship between Germany and France, but also on its relationship with Italy. After the rebellion in French North Africa, the unstable situation that France had been experiencing since the military collapse of 1940 has been clarified. Afterwards, France will begin its new life. Therefore, Laval recognizes that France has undergone complete changes in internal affairs and diplomacy. For example, the construction of the new French army is currently underway. Within the scope of the new Europe, France's most important task lies in the economic aspects and the use of manpower. Marshal P√©tain has authorized Laval to handle this matter. Commentators here refuse to comment on France's internal affairs, as Laval's relationship with various political parties is purely a French internal matter.

Vichy, 19th (Haitong News Agency) - According to well-informed sources, Marshal P√©tain may broadcast an address to the French people on Christmas Day.

Vichy, 19th (Haitong News Agency) - It was announced last night that during Laval's absence, all his powers will be temporarily exercised by Economic and Financial Minister Cathala.

### De Gaulle's Speech

Saigon, 19th (Haitong News Agency) - The Vietnamese government held an extraordinary meeting last night, and Governor-General de Gaulle delivered a speech, forcefully stating that Vietnam is determined and, if necessary, will rise up to defend its territory. Japanese Special Envoy Aozawa has worked hard to promote the friendly relations between Japan and Vietnam and has achieved remarkable results. In internal affairs, Vietnam should still benefit its motherland. Regarding the economic situation, efforts should be made in the future to promote development in order to improve it. Vietnam's future can rely on the barter trade of East Asian countries to enter a better state.

### Negotiations on the Japanese-Vietnamese Economic Agreement Have Begun

Saigon, 19th (Central News Agency) - The Secretary-General of the Japanese Embassy in Vietnam, Kuriyama, returned to Saigon on the 17th.

Therefore, it decided to establish this company at a meeting yesterday and requested the approval of the relevant authorities.

### Litvinov Protests to the United States

Rome, 19th (Central News Agency) - According to news from Lisbon, Soviet Ambassador to the United States Litvinov recently made a serious protest to President Roosevelt, stating that the United States may freely operate in Europe, the Mediterranean, and areas of greatest concern to the Soviet Union and Britain. Before proceeding, the political work should not be carried out without the understanding of Moscow and London. He further stated the opinion of People's Commissar Stalin that the world outside of Europe should be the focus of American military and political action. The Anglo-Soviet agreement on political cooperation in Europe was notified to the United States. The US government's response to this is unknown. However, the General Commander of the Allied Forces in North Africa Eisenhower's disregard for the Anglo-Soviet position and the frequent decisive measures can be understood. It remains to be seen how President Roosevelt will handle the relationship between the United States and the United Kingdom in the future.

### The Decisive Battle Continues (2) ‚Äì Broadcast Speech by Section Chief Hiraide of the Navy Press Department, Translated from the December 8th "Yomiuri Hochi"

Outline of the Battle of the Solomon Islands

In order to recover from the setbacks since the beginning of the war, the United States mobilized its powerful productive capacity and launched a counter-offensive operation in the Pacific. The offensives towards the Aleutians, Gilbert Islands, and Solomon Islands in early August were all part of this operational plan. Among them, the enemy focused its main force on the Solomon Islands area. This series of American counter-offensives, as the initial counter-offensive in September since the Battle of Hawaii, is worthy of our attention.

During the approximately four months since the first Battle of the Solomon Islands on August 7th, the enemy lost four battleships, eight aircraft carriers, and a total of one hundred and twenty-five various other ships and transport vessels were sunk, and over eight hundred and fifty aircraft were shot down in that area. On our side, in addition to the loss of one battleship, a total of forty-one transport vessels were lost, and two hundred and thirty-seven aircraft (including those not yet returned). Furthermore, regarding the war results in the year since the start of the war, three hundred and seventy-seven enemy ships and four hundred and sixteen vessels were sunk, and three thousand eight hundred aircraft were shot down. On our side, approximately forty round vessels of various types, approximately fifty vessels, and five hundred and fifty-six aircraft were lost.

Thus, reviewing the progress of the war over the past year and the signs of the war results, it is clear that the enemy is increasingly entering into major battles, and our war results are also expanding daily, differing vastly from those of the enemy. However, in these fierce battles, our side inevitably suffers some losses. This point must be noted when examining the overall war situation in relation to the production war.

Examples of Fleet Bravery

Next, regarding how our naval officers and soldiers are fighting, I would like to cite a few examples. According to a brave warrior on an aircraft carrier participating in the recent Pacific naval battle, the aircraft of the carrier must break through seven "barrages" from attacking the enemy until returning to the ship. That is to say, our carrier-based aircraft must first break through the defensive formation of enemy fighters, then encounter the fierce anti-aircraft fire of the enemy cruiser groups. After passing through this difficult stage, they must also endure the iron-net-like anti-aircraft fire of the enemy destroyer groups. After eliminating these difficulties one by one, they finally come into contact with the enemy battleships or their aircraft carriers. The return journey is the same. Otherwise, it is impossible to return to the ship safely.

In such difficult battles, the loss of carrier-based aircraft becomes a considerable number, which is unavoidable.

In the two months following the Second Battle of the Solomon Islands, seventy-eight aircraft did not return. In the South Pacific waters, over forty aircraft did not return. In the Third Battle of the Solomon Islands, forty-one aircraft self-destructed or did not return. These illustrate that the warriors of our attack units are single-mindedly focused on destroying the enemy, and have no thought of survival. Furthermore, in the Third Battle of the Solomon Islands, one of our destroyers rushed into the enemy fleet formation, first bombarding a large enemy cruiser with artillery fire, eventually sinking it, and then rapidly continuing to bombard the enemy destroyers, even pursuing another destroyer that was trying to flee. In that hellish slaughter, we actually used one destroyer to fight off one cruiser and two destroyers. This can truly be said to be an unprecedented spectacle.

Examples like this are too numerous to mention. In short, from the freezing Aleutians in the north to the scorching battlefront in the south, our naval officers and soldiers are fighting hard, forgetting sleep and meals.

Furthermore, submarines dedicated to destroying enemy supply lines and protecting friendly transportation lines, as well as merchant ships that replenish the frontline soldiers and transport supplies at great risk, their contributions are also unforgettable. It is no exaggeration to say that merchant ships are part of the war effort. To those sailors who sacrificed themselves, we extend our condolences, just as we do to those who died honorably in battle.

### The Story of Rice: Female Civil Servants in Chongqing Unite to Fight for Subsidized Rice

Examples of women uniting and fighting for their own interests have been rare since the Sino-Japanese War. The recent request by female civil servants in Chongqing to amend the method of issuing subsidized rice is an exception.

What civil servants in Chongqing opposed was Article 6 of the "Measures for War-Time Living Subsidies for Civil Servants" passed by the "Supreme National Defense Council": "If both husband and wife are civil servants, the wife shall not be eligible to receive subsidized rice." Those who took the lead in protesting were female civil servants from the "Central Party Headquarters," the "Ministry of Education," and other agencies, and they organized an alliance to act as a liaison group for future actions. The alliance has already filed its charter.

This matter is not significant, but it has sparked public discussion, and some have come forward to offer impartial opinions, believing that the measure does indeed violate the spirit of gender equality and the principle of equal pay for equal work. However, in order to prevent anyone from receiving double subsidized rice, they advocate that the "husband" civil servant should support his parents and receive four dou of rice, while the "wife" civil servant should care for their children and receive six dou of rice.

But now the "Executive Yuan" has decided to amend the article: "If both husband and wife are civil servants, only one person (husband or wife) shall be allowed to receive subsidized rice."

This may still be a problem that cannot be completely resolved. Unless subsidized rice is eliminated, allowances should be provided based on the price index at any time. In fact, some agencies have already done so, such as the Ministry of Communications, but agencies without operating income cannot follow suit.

Today's subsidized rice loan is, in fact, a form of disguised salary. From this perspective, it would be reasonable for female civil servants to receive the same subsidized rice as their husbands. Without the subsidized rice allowance, the income of a civil servant is indeed limited. Fortunately, there are not many female civil servants, and even fewer couples who are both civil servants. Most women who work are forced to do so by circumstances, and 90% of them leave their children to the care of domestic workers. A female civil servant who only receives a salary probably cannot afford to hire a domestic worker. In recent years, there have been many examples of wives of civil servants in Chongqing struggling to make a living.

In short, the high prices of goods today are a reality. War-time morality has lost its standard, and unscrupulous merchants and private dealers, with their brains and bellies full of fat, sit comfortably and become wealthy, acquiring extraordinary clothing, food, housing, and transportation, while those who work diligently in their positions are in danger of freezing and starvation. People are struggling in a turbulent current, and few can withstand the washing away. In cities, there is a contrast between the nouveau riche and widespread poverty; in rural areas, there is a contrast between large and new landlords and tenant farmers who cannot make a living. People are tearing each other apart in the struggle for material life, only interested in profit. In Chongqing publications, people often lament the decline of national wisdom and ask what merits and crimes will be judged during or after the war.

Sanctions! Sanctions! The spirit of the rule of law is not enough. So many cases of corruption and perversion of the law are like fleeting clouds, passing by in a shadow, and ultimately no solid evidence is found, and nothing comes to light.

For example, on the Mid-Autumn Festival, the tragic incident in which two girls' schools in Baisha Town, Jiangjin County, Sichuan, collapsed in the same morning, killing several students, is already a reflection of this society. So many schools are operating for profit, and so many principals and clerks are lining their pockets, at least under the pretext of "wartime frugality," acting carelessly and neglecting human life.

### Strict Sugar Sales Measures to Prevent Resale for Profit: Sugar Purchases Require Citizen Certificates Matching Donation Tickets, and Authorities are Requested to Crack Down on Vendors Who Raise Prices to Buy Up Sugar

Since the Shanghai Sugar Merchants Cooperative Business Office implemented the new system of selling sugar based on house donation tickets and citizen certificates, a Commercial News reporter learned from the Cooperative Office yesterday that, in view of the fact that the monthly allocation of retail sugar is sufficient to meet the normal needs of consumers, and in order to prevent resale for profit, strict measures have been adopted to protect legitimate consumers. The following regulations have been specifically stipulated: (1) Anyone holding a house donation ticket to purchase sugar from a designated retailer shall be allowed to purchase up to 40 yuan in Central Reserve Bank of China currency per ticket. However, the purchaser must bring their Public Concession citizen certificate and French Concession identity card, which must match the address listed on the house donation ticket. (2) Anyone holding a citizen certificate to purchase sugar from a retailer shall be limited to one yuan in Central Reserve Bank of China currency per person per purchase. The citizen certificate held must be limited to the individual. The above measures are intended to prevent abuses, so all sugar purchased with house donation tickets and citizen certificates is limited to consumers' own use, and private resale at inflated prices is absolutely prohibited. In addition, the Concession authorities are requested to crack down on vendors who raise prices to buy up sugar. The total of 30,000 bags of sugar allocated for this month has been allocated, and retailers have completed payment procedures and are allowed to pick up the goods from designated sugar dealers starting today, and sell them widely in accordance with the methods stipulated by the Cooperative Office.

### Caution Should be Exercised When Eating Pufferfish: Police Warn Residents

According to police sources, another case of pufferfish poisoning occurred at noon on the 18th in this city. The incident took place on Xiaoshadu Road. Four members of the Chen family were poisoned. It is said that the pufferfish they ate was purchased that morning at the Ximolu vegetable market and consumed at lunch. Within a few minutes of eating, they complained of severe stomach pain and their faces turned pale. They were sent to Elizabeth Hospital for treatment by their family members who had not eaten. It is reported that their lives are all in danger. This is the fourth case of poisoning from cheap and greedily eaten pufferfish in this city since this winter. After the third incident, Mr. Yoshiaki Tashiro, Director of the Municipal Council's Health Bureau, told reporters that if another case of pufferfish poisoning occurred in this city, the Health Bureau would have to issue an order prohibiting the sale of pufferfish in all vegetable markets in order to maintain the health of residents. But now, in fact, a case of poisoning from eating pufferfish has been discovered. According to reporters, although the Health Bureau has not yet issued an order banning the sale or consumption of pufferfish, there is a high possibility that a ban will be implemented. The police also issued a warning yesterday, urging residents who do not understand the methods of cooking and cleaning pufferfish not to eat pufferfish in the future. According to reporters, relevant parties have learned that because the weather in this city has been warm recently, no cases of poisoning from residents burning coal stoves for heating have been discovered. However, in view of the situation in previous years, the Health Bureau authorities have not only notified residents to be careful to prevent such incidents from occurring, but will also step up preparations for rescue work when necessary.

### Rongwushe Discusses I Ching

At the 76th meeting of Rongwushe, Mr. Yang Zhongyi discussed I Ching research, saying that the Zhou Yi Sequence of the Hexagrams begins with Qian and Kun and ends with Ji Ji and Wei Ji. In between, each pair of hexagrams is arranged in sequence one above the other. All hexagrams that can be inverted are combined into one image by combining the inverted hexagrams. Hexagrams that cannot be inverted are combined into two images by combining the adjacent hexagrams. Except for the eight hexagrams of Qian, Kun, Kan, Li, Da Guo, Yi, Xiao Guo, and Zhong Fu, which can only be juxtaposed but not combined, the remaining fifty-six hexagrams can be combined and juxtaposed. The Sequence of the Hexagrams is all about combination, not juxtaposition. Therefore, the two hexagrams are arranged one above the other, forming one hexagram upwards and one hexagram downwards. Although looking at them normally and upside down divides them into two hexagrams, inverting and reversing them combines them into only one image. Therefore, the fifty-six hexagrams only have eight images of inversion and reversal. At the 77th meeting, Dr. Song Guobin brought a hexagram diagram, which was his experience in studying the I Ching for a year, and invented a shortcut for calculating the palace and generation. Mr. Yang Zhenru spoke on his behalf, briefly saying that the principle of Jing Fang's palace and generation is based on the superposition and transformation of the eight pure hexagrams. One line changes to one generation, and five lines change to five generations. Leaving the upper line unchanged, the lower four lines change to the wandering spirit, and the lower hexagram returns to the returning spirit. All juxtaposed hexagrams are of the same generation. The yin and yang lines of the second and fourth generation hexagrams must be in the ratio of two to four. The first, third, and fifth generations have two types: one is in the ratio of one to five, and the other is an equal number of yin and yang. And the third generation hexagram, except for the returning spirit, must be internally and externally juxtaposed. The recently invented shortcut is determined by whether the hexagram lines are responsive or not. For example, if responsive is yang and unresponsive is yin, then the six lines of the eight pure hexagrams are unresponsive like Kun, the first and fourth lines of the first generation hexagram are responsive like Zhen, the second and fifth lines of the second generation hexagram are also responsive like Dui, and the third and upper lines of the third generation hexagram are also responsive like Qian. The first and fourth lines of the fourth generation hexagram are unresponsive like Xun, and the second and fifth lines of the fifth generation hexagram are also unresponsive like Gen. Only the second and fifth lines of the wandering spirit hexagram are unresponsive like Li, and only the second and fifth lines of the returning spirit hexagram are responsive like Kan. Once the number of generations is known, it can be inferred which palace the hexagram belongs to. The method is that the first, second, and third generations determine the palace according to the outer hexagram, and the fourth and fifth generations and the wandering spirit determine the palace according to the juxtaposition of the inner hexagram. As for the returning spirit hexagram, the palace is determined according to the inner hexagram. This method is simple, and even those who are not familiar with the art of palace and generation can know which generation and which palace it belongs to in an instant by picking up a hexagram.

Report from the Shanghai Municipal Council Fire Brigade

During the month of January, the Shanghai Municipal Council Fire Brigade received a total of ten fire alarms and forty-two incidents, including three false alarms of good intention and three special alarms. The estimated value of the property lost due to fires located within the Public Concession and the Special Rates Area is approximately 474,270 yuan. Two residents died and two were injured in fires. Two people were injured in special alarms. In addition, the Fire Brigade ambulance team was dispatched 170 times, transporting a total of 194 patients to various hospitals.

### Sales of Cooking Oil Temporarily Suspended Due to Discovery of Counterfeit House Donation Tickets

The Cooking Oil Wholesale Office distributed a batch of newly allocated cooking oil to various retail oil shops, and retail sales were originally scheduled to begin today based on house donation tickets, which was convenient for the citizens. However, according to the latest news last night, sales have been suddenly suspended today. The reason is that the authorities recently discovered that counterfeit house donation tickets had been found, and are currently investigating. As a result, the sale of oil based on house donation tickets must be postponed until the investigation is clear.

Counterfeit Donation Tickets Used to Sell Sugar for Profit

In this city, the sale of sugar has recently been limited to each household based on house donations, in order to make it universal and to prevent resale for profit. However, Lin Mingda (18 years old), an apprentice at the Lixing Public Customs Brokerage at No. 7, Lane 28, Catholic Church Street, French Concession, had a fanciful idea. He took an old house donation ticket from the Public Concession and took it to the printing shop set up by Zhu Jichen in the Nine Acre Land of Nanshi, and printed the most recent monthly donation tickets in the same way. He conspired with his friend Long Yongqing (21 years old) to take them to the Xiexingxiang South Goods Store on Avenue Edward VII to purchase limited-price sugar three times, a total of fifteen packages, weighing twenty catties, with the intention of profiting from it. Unexpectedly, Detective Tao Ronglin of the French police learned of this and arrested Lin Long and the printing shop owner Zhu Jichen together. He seized a large number of counterfeit donation tickets and other items, and took them to the police station. After investigation, he transferred them to the court yesterday and prosecuted them for the crime of forgery. Under interrogation, Lin Mingda and Long Yongqing confessed that they had counterfeited with the intention of profiting, and Zhu Jichen confessed that Lin Mingda came to his house on the fifth of this month and asked him to print 500 of these house donation tickets, saying that they were for customs brokerage use. At the time, the citizen was deceived into printing them. Later, a friend surnamed Zhang discovered their deceit, and the citizen immediately stopped printing, and only five copies were taken away. He really didn't know that they were used to buy sugar. The court declared the trial concluded and ordered the defendants to await sentencing on the 24th.

### Public Concession Baojia Heads Investigate Citizen Certificates

The Public Concession Baojia authorities ordered the Baojia personnel in each district to investigate citizen certificates in the area, and more than a week has passed, but the work has not yet been completed. The number of citizens in each district who have not received citizen certificates is still large, or those who reside in the Public Concession but have received citizen certificates in the West Shanghai area and have not yet applied to the police station to change procedures, are not small in number. The authorities have now ordered the Baojia heads in each district to investigate carefully. If the above situation is found, the head of the household should be ordered to go to the police station to apply for a citizen certificate and complete various procedures as soon as possible, otherwise the head of the household will be punished and the person will be severely punished.

### Aurora High School Charity Concert This Afternoon in the School Auditorium

Aurora University held a campaign to raise winter clothing, and received enthusiastic donations from all walks of life, with remarkable results. Now the high school department of the school is also responding to the need for winter clothing donations and is holding a charity concert. The program includes singing and performances by famous artists, as well as many valuable records. Tickets are priced at two yuan, three yuan, and three yuan for honorary seats. The date is this Sunday, the 20th, at 2:30 PM, and the location is the Aurora University Auditorium. Tickets are sold at the Aiheng Piano Store on Jing'an Temple Road, the Shanghai Piano Store, the Xiangxing Piano Store on Avenue Joffre, and the Aurora University Communication Office on Rue Luthien.

### Explanation by the Public Works Bureau: Clarifying Methods for Recognizing Air Raid Alarms; Providing Detailed Instructions for Citizens' Attention

The Public Works Bureau Intelligence Department announced that, in light of the ongoing air raid drills, citizens may not be fully clear on the issuance and cancellation of air raid alarms, as well as how to respond. Therefore, the following explanations are provided separately (applicable to the French Concession as well):

Alarm Type (Issuance or Cancellation) (The length of the siren sound is the same day and night)

Air Raid Alert Alarm: One long sound, lasting 30 seconds

Cancellation of Alert Alarm: Two long sounds, each lasting 20 seconds

Air Raid Alarm: Several short sounds, each lasting 5 seconds (repeated with short intervals)

Transition from Air Raid Alarm to Alert Alarm: Two long sounds, each lasting 20 seconds

Complete Cancellation of Alarm: Two long sounds, each lasting 20 seconds

How Citizens Should Respond

After the alert alarm is issued: (Daytime) All air defense equipment should be prepared immediately for emergency use during air raids; (Nighttime) Indoor lights and vehicle lights should be shielded or covered immediately, and air defense equipment should be prepared for emergency use during air raids. (Note) Only designated streetlights and alleyway lights are permitted to remain on.

After the cancellation of the alert alarm: (Daytime) Return to the original state before the alert alarm; (Nighttime) Return to the original state before the alert alarm, but door lights, advertising lights, and decorative lights are not allowed to be turned on.

After the air raid alarm is issued: (Daytime) All vehicles should be parked along the side of the sidewalk, and drivers and passengers should immediately leave the vehicles and seek shelter nearby. General pedestrians should immediately go to the nearest "waiting shelter" or "air raid shelter" and then gradually walk home, walking on the left side of the sidewalk and not in the middle of the road. Street vendors and hawkers should immediately stop selling, and car horns must be muted. (Nighttime) All vehicles should be parked along the side of the sidewalk, with headlights turned off, and drivers and passengers should leave the vehicles and seek shelter nearby. General pedestrians should immediately go to the nearest "waiting shelter" or "air raid shelter" and then gradually walk home, walking on the left side of the sidewalk and not in the middle of the road. Street vendors and hawkers should immediately stop selling. Unnecessary lights indoors should be turned off, and other lights permitted to remain on should be covered more carefully than during the alert alarm. Windows and doors should be covered with dark curtains, and any light leaks should be remedied immediately to ensure no light is visible from outdoors. Matches and flashlights are not allowed to be used, and smoking outdoors is prohibited. (Note) All streetlights and alleyway lights should be turned off immediately, and car horns should be muted.

When transitioning from an air raid alarm to an alert alarm: (Daytime) All alert measures should be changed to the regulations for the alert alarm period; (Nighttime) All alert measures should be changed to the regulations for the alert alarm period.

(Note) When the cancellation of air raid alarm signal is issued, it only means that the air raid alarm has been lifted, but the alert alarm continues to exist. When a "complete cancellation signal" is issued to lift both the air raid and alert alarms, it will be announced by the radio station. Residents without radios can inquire at the nearest police station. It is relatively easy to identify the simultaneous lifting of air raid and alert alarms at night, as all streetlights and vehicle lights will be turned on.

After the complete cancellation signal is issued: (Daytime) Everything should return to the original state of the preparedness period, meaning that all arrangements should remain in place so that one can immediately enter the alert stage upon the issuance of an alert alarm; (Nighttime) Everything should return to the original state of the preparedness period, meaning that all arrangements should remain in place so that one can immediately enter the alert stage upon the issuance of an alert alarm.

### Shanghai West Financial Advisory Council Formally Established Yesterday; Assisting the Authorities in the Construction of Shanghai West Municipal Administration; Japanese Residents of the Western District Cooperate in Municipal Obligations

The Shanghai West Financial Advisory Committee has completed its preparations. All nine financial advisory committee members, four recommended by the Public Works Bureau and five selected by the Municipal Government, after mutual agreement, held an inaugural meeting at the Municipal Government yesterday (the 19th) at 3:00 PM. Attendees included Secretary-General Zhao Zunyue, representing Mayor Chen, Okazaki, the chairman representing the Public Works Bureau, Nakagawa, representing Consul-General Yano, Kurita, representing Colonel Watanabe, as well as all committee members Zhu Boquan, Sanwa Shizuichiro, etc. (the list appeared in yesterday's newspaper), and over forty directors from various bureaus of the Municipal Government. Secretary-General Zhao, representing the Mayor, gave a report, followed by speeches from representatives of the Japanese Consulate-General and committee members. The details are recorded below:

Secretary-General Zhao's Speech

Secretary-General Zhao reported that the Financial Advisory Committee was established as a result of the Shanghai West Financial Agreement. The Municipal Government and the Public Works Bureau carefully considered and selected committee members with high reputations and the ability to bear heavy responsibilities, which has led to the establishment of the committee today. He believed there were two important significances: (1) Shanghai West's income is used for Shanghai West's expenditures, so having people residing in Shanghai West with financial knowledge and experience supervise finances and assist financial administration can benefit all citizens of Shanghai West; (2) Managing municipal administration is to benefit the citizens, and it is hoped that citizens will participate and cooperate together to benefit the local citizens. The committee is the preliminary step for citizens to participate in municipal administration, so the committee's mission is extremely important, and it is hoped that the committee can accomplish this mission in the future.

Speech by the Representative of the Japanese Consulate

Next, Secretary Nakagawa, representing Consul-General Yano, delivered a speech on behalf of the guests, congratulating the development of the committee and hoping that the Municipal Government, the Public Works Bureau, and the members of the Advisory Committee would work together to build Shanghai West and fulfill its mission. He also stated that, according to existing laws and treaties, Japanese residents in the Shanghai West area have no obligation to pay taxes to the Chinese side. However, in view of the need to strengthen Sino-Japanese cooperation and the possibility of Japanese residents participating in the municipal administration of the Chinese side, in order to appropriately contribute to the various facilities of the Chinese side in the area, they will voluntarily pay the same license fees and taxes as those paid to the Public Works Bureau to the Shanghai Special Municipal Government in the future.

Director Yuan's Report

Yuan Houzhi, Director of the Finance Bureau, reported on the establishment of the committee, stating that he was ordered by the Mayor to negotiate with the Public Works Bureau to recover the finances of Shanghai West. Under the Mayor's guidance, the Shanghai West Financial Agreement was signed on January 1 of this year, agreeing to organize an advisory committee composed of representatives of the people. Because the Mayor carefully appointed the committee members, it was not until today that the committee was officially established. Finally, committee member Feng Bingnan delivered a speech, stating that the committee's responsibilities are so important that they will do their best to assist the authorities, contribute opinions, and fulfill their mission.

### Shanghai Rural District Party Affairs Office New Life Demonstration Week

The Shanghai Rural District Party Affairs Office of the Chinese Nationalist Party held its fourth office affairs meeting yesterday. Attendees included Deputy Director Li Wengong, Deputy Director Wen Huan, and more than thirty other colleagues from the office. Deputy Director Shan presided over the meeting, reporting on the purpose of convening the office affairs meeting and the work reports of various departments. Deputy Director Li then gave a speech encouraging colleagues to strive to achieve the "Five Emphases" so that rural cleansing work can be completed as soon as possible. Then, discussions began: (1) Holding a public rural cleansing donation, resolved to pass as originally proposed, to be implemented after reporting for approval; (2) Holding member and public proxy tests to recognize the meaning of rural cleansing and promote the purpose of comprehensive peace, resolved to pass, to be jointly organized by the Organization and People's Movement Departments; (3) Planning to hold expanded publicity in various districts on New Year's Day next year to celebrate, resolved to pass, to be organized by the Propaganda Department; (4) Holding a New Life Movement demonstration week to encourage, resolved to pass, to be handled by the People's Movement Department. In addition, it was heard that in order to improve work efficiency, the office has also adjusted internal personnel.

### Young Calligrapher and Painter Fang Wen Charity Exhibition to Aid Education

The young calligrapher and painter Fang Wen, from a prominent family in Taizhou with a rich family collection, possesses artistic genius. At only twelve years old, he is skilled in both calligraphy and painting, which is of interest to the Shanghai art world and calligraphy and painting enthusiasts. On the evening of the ninth, his father, Fang Zijun, invited Ma Gongyu, Zhang Wenkui, and teachers from the Public Works Bureau Elementary School and Chinese Public School on Xinzao Road to a dinner at the Fuzhong Company. The guest room was filled with his works, from large characters to small-sized works in various styles such as Zhong Ding inscriptions, Wei steles, Han clerical script, and running and cursive scripts, all written vividly and appropriately. Therefore, Fang Wen is regarded as a prodigy. Last winter, I saw the young calligraphers Qian Hailong and others wielding their brushes for guests at the China United Cultural Relics Exhibition, boldly writing dozens of works in various styles with vigorous strokes, fully demonstrating their aesthetic sense. Now, he will exhibit and sell two hundred of his vacation works at the Daxin Painting Gallery from the eleventh, with all proceeds going to the Children's Welfare Association, Children's Hospital, People's Women and Children's Hospital, and to aid out-of-school children. Using the young friend's art to help and rescue out-of-school young friends seems very meaningful. (Huang Jingwan)

### As the National Calendar Year Ends, Qian Zhuang Suspends Lending; Urging Debtors to Repay Loans

Since various banks and money houses in the city began preparing for the final settlement of accounts for the Republic of China's thirtieth year, they have been busy handling interbank settlements. It is now scheduled that various banks and money houses will handle the settlement of the savings department starting from the 20th. According to reporters, as the national calendar year ends, the acceptance of loan applications will be temporarily suspended, and debtors will be urged to repay their loans.

### Aid to Education and Poverty Alleviation

Regarding the student aid fund of this newspaper, yesterday Mr. Jiang Jihui used one thousand yuan from the birthday gifts of relatives and friends for his sixtieth birthday, saving the banquet expenses, and transferring it to the student aid fund to benefit relatives and friends. Mr. Qu generously donated five hundred yuan, and Fan Su donated fifty yuan, totaling one thousand five hundred and fifty yuan in reserve notes. The previous balance was 100,394 yuan, 1 jiao and 2 fen, bringing the total balance to 100,549 yuan, 1 jiao and 2 fen.

This newspaper launched a poverty alleviation movement, appealing for the poor and sick compatriots. Yesterday, Mr. Zhu Lianbao, on behalf of Ms. Cai Peizhen, donated 200 yuan from savings for the sick, and Mr. Qu donated 500 yuan. Mr. Ma's family saved 30 yuan from the expenses of the first month celebration of his daughter. The previous balance was 2,942 yuan and 12 yuan, bringing the total balance to 3,672 yuan.

Yinpin Shen Jingan sent a letter describing his dire situation, with several family members in a precarious situation. Seeing that your newspaper is helping the poor and sick with compassion, you can be called good people. In addition, five teachers from Qicheng Elementary School wrote a letter for their colleague Zhou Xunwen, informing that he has been overworked recently and has been coughing blood and hospitalized in Renji Hospital. He has no money for expenses and is very worried. Colleagues are in the same situation and cannot help but watch without being able to rescue him, which is unbearable. Therefore, they especially ask you to provide assistance and urgently provide relief.

Referee Hei Gu, patrol members Te Si and Shen Huichun. The East League has a cloud of fierce generals, including four members of the World Games team: Jia Youliang, Li Tiansheng, Sun Jinshun, and Zhuo Shijin. Goalkeeper Liu Xianhan is extraordinary. The Zhuang-Li iron gates are lined up on the left and right, and the defense is as solid as gold. Center back Song Lingsheng is a pillar of strength, and Jiangshan has no prisoners. With Zheng Yingquan and Liang Shutang assisting on the left and right, it is even more icing on the cake. The front five tigers, led by A Dai, with Sun Tietui and Han Longhai on both sides, are a majestic force. Jia Youliang and Zhuo Shijin take charge on the wings - very good. It is a pity that Xu Wenkui is unable to play due to illness, and I am getting closer to the ideal. The Western Union side is mainly composed of the Italian Navy this time, no longer in the form of the Baojia Self-Defense Cup. Goalkeeper McNett is agile, and the fierceness of right-winger Vera has been well-known. The left-winger Di Panna and center forward Colabros are also excellent materials. With the participation of Portuguese veterans Victor and Oliveira and V. Sojo, the lineup is exceptionally strong. The East League can be said to have met its match.

### Gold Jewelry Prices Plunge on the Local Market; Quotations Further Reduced; Overnight Interest Rate Rises to 25%

Yesterday in the city's silver shop industry, Daxin and other firms' retail price for gold jewelry was reduced by 100 yuan at 9:35 AM, to 3,150 yuan per tael. By 10:15 AM, it was reduced by another 150 yuan, to only 3,000 yuan. It rebounded by 100 yuan at 11:30 AM, and finally 3,100 yuan, still down by 150 yuan. (The purchase price was reduced by about 300 yuan.) It was also a non-official price by competitors, a drop before a sudden rebound. In the morning, continuing the previous day's sluggishness, the initial price was 2,800 yuan, 100 yuan lower than the previous day's final price. It continued to decline amid selling pressure, reaching a low of 2,700 yuan. After 10:15 AM, local forces aided the low by absorbing, and customers stopped selling. It suddenly rose sharply, reaching 2,870 yuan at noon, 300 yuan lower than the previous day's final price, a difference of 170 yuan. Transactions were sparse. The retail price for silver jewelry remained at 16 yuan per tael, and the industry's price was 17 yuan and 7.5 yuan.

The Money Industry Association's overnight interest rate was 25%, and suddenly rose by another 2%.

### Military Notes Strong, United Reserve Notes Fall

Yesterday, military notes were strong. The inter-bank price was 5 yuan, 5 jiao, 5 fen, 6.8 li.

United Reserve Notes fell another 1 jiao, selling for 4 yuan and buying for only 3 yuan, 9 jiao.

### Government Bonds Exist in Name Only; Most Are Observers

The government bond market was very quiet because of the Saturday trading history, and each faction was not present. Most have become observers. Although there were transactions, they were very minimal. The market conditions became weaker. As the end of the year approached, most were dealing with the closing, and there was no intention to operate. Although various bonds still had prices yesterday, there were very few sales. A bonds were 5 yuan, B bonds were 4 yuan, 1 jiao, 3 fen, C bonds were 5 yuan, 6 jiao, 7 fen, D bonds were around 1 yuan, and E bonds were in the range of 3 yuan. Most exist in name only.

### Watson's Pharmacy Increases Capital

All Fully Paid

Watson's Pharmacy, a Chinese-owned enterprise, was founded by medical experts in the Yu Rong district. For a year, it has been manufacturing various Western medicines with wide sales. The company expanded its organization last month and increased its capital to 4 million yuan, which has been fully paid.

### Factory Cloth Transactions Are Clear; East Pieces of Fine Cloth Are Expensive

The factory cloth market was unusually idle yesterday, but the auction price was still high. For example, 12-pound Earth Brand fine cloth was priced at 195 yuan, but there were no transactions. The coarse cloth market was barely open, with only Peach Lady's Lynn cloth trading at 318 yuan. Later, the price was 320 yuan, but there was no accurate market price.

East pieces of cloth quickly became more expensive, and fine cloth chips were tight. The new order for 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth was 198 yuan and 5 jiao, a further increase of 2 yuan. Bank order 2 (200 yuan, lottery ball 199 yuan and 5 jiao, Flying Fish 199 yuan, Yanghe 199 yuan, Trumpet 198 yuan and 5 jiao, Five Blessings 198 yuan and 2 jiao, Half four gentlemen's serge order 7 yuan, 8 jiao, 5 fen, and the price of making 7 yuan, 8 jiao, 7 fen also increased by 5 fen.

### Broadcloth Market Stable

The broadcloth market is stable, and the prices of wool, cotton, silk, hemp, yarn fabrics, and various other commodities are mostly stable. There are mostly advances without retreats, mainly due to the lack of production and inventory. The current wholesale price of Meifeng overcoat fabric yesterday was 370 yuan per yard. Yinfeng gabardine was 226-7 yuan, Lixing poplin was 145-6 yuan, and No. 39 Hailin cloth was 200 yuan. Yuanfeng suit flannel was 240 yuan. Gongda all-hemp cloth was 45-6 yuan, Da Fugui was 9 yuan and 5 jiao, Wen Suchen was 9 yuan, and Taiji soft lining was 7 yuan and 6 jiao. Hongsheng printed foreign cloth was 15 yuan and a half, and Chengfeng mercerized feather yarn, the top grade was 9 yuan and a half, and the second grade was 8 yuan and 2 jiao. Yinfeng (now renamed Huanfeng) 470 French lining was 6 yuan and 2 jiao.

### Coarse Grains Generally Stable

Yesterday, there were not many coarse grain transactions, and the market was quiet. Initially, 30 bags of Chongming sand yellow opened at a price of 330 yuan, to 335 yuan. Another 40 bags of sand red were priced at 350 yuan to 355 yuan. Yuanlong soybean cake had three trucks, priced at 83 yuan and a half to 83 yuan and 7 jiao.

### Candied Berries are Short in Stock

Due to combined interests, the incoming goods are unwilling to be released according to the market price and are still holding firm. Therefore, the existing inventory in the market suddenly feels short, and the trend is tight. Yesterday's market price for medium-sized candied berries was 5,200 yuan, an increase of 100 to 200 yuan compared to the previous price.

### Cigarette Popularity is Weak; Top-Quality Goods Are Scarce, and Prices Rise Alone

The cigarette market, after the association closed the market, has recently continued to be sold by competitors outside the market, but the trend has become flat. The distribution of Japanese cigarettes is intermittent, and there may be strict penalties for limiting the prices of British and American goods, resulting in weak popularity and dull transactions. Only the top-quality goods dominate, and the prices are: 50 Capstan cigarettes for 26,000 yuan, 3-5 brand for 11,000 yuan, Big Three Cannons for 11,500 yuan, Big Nanyang Wei for 22,000 yuan, Little Three Cannons for 7,300 yuan per ten, Three Cannons for 8,300 yuan, and Little Three Cannons for 5,200 yuan (calculated at the price of 10,000 pieces). Big Nanyang Wei 380 yuan per pack of ten, Da Qianmen 50 yuan, Peiling brand 50 yuan, calculated at the price of 200 packs. Other prices are similar to the previous day.

### Daily Necessities Market is Chaotic

Yesterday morning, the prices in the daily necessities market were slightly active, because some new hoarders still intended to absorb them, but the prices were quite chaotic, depending on the need. Generally, Phoenix brand matches were 3,000 yuan, Beauty brand was 3,200 yuan, Golden Tripod brand was 2,700 yuan and 10 yuan, miscellaneous brand matches were 2,300 yuan, Guben soap was 510 yuan, Huang Xiangmao was 415 yuan, Bai Xiangmao was 480 yuan, Arrow brand was 490 yuan, Bai Li's candles were 370 yuan, Sengmao brand was 325 yuan, and Shinpai was 230 yuan.

### The Way Out for Black Iron Billets is Sparse

The 2,000-pound black iron billets have been inactive for a long time, because the factory users and customers in this street have all stopped. However, yesterday the retail transactions in the market slightly stirred. The hot water bottle factory, printing iron factory, and billet factory in this street also approved slightly, but because the market inventory is weak, it is difficult to have large transactions, only three or four bundles of retail transactions. The standard market price is 15,000 yuan to 16,000 yuan per bundle, depending on the color, size, thickness, etc. In addition, the price of 12 to 14 black iron sheet heads is 14,000 yuan per ton, and the price of 20 black iron sheet heads is 16,000 yuan per ton.

### Deadline for Registration of Yarn and Cloth Inventory Extended to Tomorrow; Public Works Bureau Has Approved the Request of the Two Industry Associations

The Public Works Bureau of the Public Concession, the French Concession Public Bureau, and the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau handled the registration of yarn and cloth inventory, originally scheduled to end on the 15th of this month. Recently, the Yarn Industry and Cotton Cloth Industry Associations, fearing that some traders may not have registered in time, jointly requested an extension from the authorities. It has been approved until the 21st of this month. Yesterday, it was specifically announced to the yarn and cloth industries that have not registered, hoping that they will complete the registration as soon as possible within the deadline: (1) Yarn and cloth traders who opened shops in the two concessions should register directly with the Public Works Bureau at 209 Jiangxi Road; (2) Cotton yarn traders who opened shops in the city should register with the Yarn Industry Association at Xiangheli No. 0, Ningbo Road; (3) Cotton cloth traders who opened shops in the city should register with the Cotton Cloth Association at No. , Shanxi Road, so that it can be forwarded to the Social Affairs Bureau for registration. No further actions will be taken after the deadline, and the authorities will have to confiscate and dispose of them.

### From Eating Burdock to Communicating Two National Cultures

‚Äî From the end

Recently, Mr. Tachibana, a Japanese rural construction movement expert, came to Shanghai. I had the opportunity to sit with him twice, and we exchanged many opinions on communicating Chinese and Japanese cultures. Because we were at the table, Mr. Tachibana cited the example of Japanese people using burdock as a vegetable, while Chinese people only use burdock as medicine, as an example of the difference between Chinese and Japanese cultures. He said that using burdock as a vegetable is true Japanese culture. I said that using burdock as medicine is true Chinese culture. The whole table laughed. At that time, a friend invited us to eat burdock hot pot at a Japanese restaurant on Avenue Road the next day as a practical attempt to communicate Chinese and Japanese cultures.

Before, we only knew that burdock could be used as medicine. After checking the Compendium of Materia Medica, we only knew that it tastes pungent and can improve eyesight, replenish the center, and remove wind damage. After trying it in person that day, although we couldn't say that everyone enjoyed it, we all felt a different flavor. At this point, I had a feeling that culture is essentially something with commonality, but because of different environments, different effects occurred, and different concepts were formed, and barriers arose between each other. If we had not had a practical attempt to eat burdock once, we would all likely have doubts in our hearts: How can burdock be used as a vegetable? Or, how can burdock be used as medicine? In fact, burdock is still burdock. Using it as a vegetable or medicine is just because of the different habits and environments that each person has obtained.

Burdock is like this, and other issues are probably the same. It's just that I am ignorant and don't know what urgently needs to be communicated besides burdock? If there is anything, I think it's okay to try it out in person like eating burdock. For example, books are the most representative of a country's culture. I hope that people in the cultural circles of China and Japan can first come up with a list of books for each other to see! This is true Chinese culture, and that is true Japanese culture. If these books can be translated one by one and exchanged with each other, it will be a great and immortal event. The future effect may be like the translation of Buddhist scriptures in the Tang Dynasty, communicating Indian culture. More than a thousand years later, both China and Japan still benefit from it.

However, eating burdock requires restaurants, and publishing books requires bookstores. Most of the Chinese bookstores in Shanghai are currently lacking in vitality. How should we revive them? Are they lacking factories? Are they lacking raw materials? Is transportation inconvenient? Is the cost too high? Yes, they are all eagerly hoping that all parties can assist them! Because we all know that cultural undertakings are related to long-term plans, and books have always been called spiritual food; therefore, every time we think of the importance of national revitalization and the lack of spiritual food, we think of these cultural restaurants - bookstores, which need to be revived first. As the saying goes, "If a worker wants to do his job well, he must first sharpen his tools." We hope that all parties will provide them with convenience as much as possible and help them overcome difficulties as much as possible!

At the same time, because cultural undertakings are a long-term plan, we also hope that all those engaged in cultural undertakings can have a broader vision, not just seek profit eagerly, but should take the completion of cultural missions as a prerequisite, just as Mencius said to King Hui of Liang, "King, why must you say profit? There is also benevolence and righteousness." If the cultures of China and Japan can truly achieve the purpose of communication and no longer have barriers to each other, then why worry that there will be no profit!

### The Performance of "Begonia"

‚Äî Qin Shouou

After numerous twists and turns, the Shanghai Art Theater's performance of "Begonia" has finally been decided to be staged at the Carlton Theater starting on the 24th of this month. This is an extremely ordinary trivial matter, but unexpectedly, due to various reasons, it has been delayed for two or three months before it can finally be accomplished after overcoming all difficulties. "It's really not easy to do a good job!" I can't help but sigh deeply.

I am the original author of "Begonia". In this matter, I can be considered a party involved, so I would like to say a few words before the play is staged.

"Begonia" is not a very exciting novel, only very dramatic, so both parties are willing to adapt it for performance. However, in my own heart, what I expect most is the spoken drama and the movie. The movie is written and directed by Mr. Ma Xuwibang, so I can rest assured. The script for the spoken drama was first adapted by my fellow townsman Mr. Liao Kangmin, who volunteered. His knowledge is very good, and the adaptation is also very fast, but he is young and lacks some experience, so later, I rewrote it once myself. But in the end, Mr. Fei Mu, Huang Zuolin, and Gu Zhongyi, regardless of the hard work, greatly deleted and revised the script that I had revised. So the script to be staged at this moment has already integrated the efforts of five people. Although I dare not exaggerate and say that the script is better than the original, at least I can say that the original is not better than this script (a smile).

As for the choice of director, it is even more worth mentioning. This play is co-directed by Mr. Fei Mu, Gu Zhongyi, and Huang Zuolin. It is really a "first" on the stage for three outstanding directors to co-direct a play like this!

Speaking of actors, the protagonist Begonia is played by the young artist Shi Hui, who is consistently supported by the audience. Luo Xiangqi is played by Ding Zhi and Shen Min, Mei Bao is played by Yingzi (she is simply a "Mei-type" girl), and Zhao Yukun is played by Shi Yuan! ... Almost everyone is the most outstanding talent; I firmly believe that the performance will definitely be above the standard.

However, one thing is very painful, that is, the misunderstanding that all parties have towards me. From the date of publication of the "Begonia" separate edition until today, for the sake of filming a movie, for the sake of performing a spoken drama, for the sake of discovering local places, I have encountered many unexpected misunderstandings. Regarding these, I have a general response that will be published in the next issue of "Fiction Monthly", but I have no other intentions, I just want to explain the facts.

### Sharing the Same Boat Through Wind and Rain

Huanglong said he was leaving, and he just waved his hand, and he had already darted out of the door. Weicheng looked at his back, a back like a dragon swimming, returned to the room, sat on the bed, touching his chin with one hand, lowered his head, looking at the watermelon seed shells scattered here and there on the floor; raised his head, looking at the sunlight on the wall, moving inch by inch, then leaning back, resting the back of his head on a pillow, and unknowingly fell asleep. In the afternoon, Wang Fengzi pushed the door open and came in. Seeing only Weicheng alone in the room, he smiled. "Where's the other friend?" Weicheng rubbed his eyelids, sat up, and replied, "Oh, he went out for a while, and he'll be back soon." Wang Fengzi said, "Then aren't you afraid of being lonely in the room alone? Playing cards, are you coming? Playing mahjong, it's too bookish, and there's not much winning or losing. Like a gentleman, you can come and play, it's much better than being alone in the house." Weicheng said: "Thank you, I don't play cards much." Wang Fengzi clicked his tongue, seemingly feeling sorry for Weicheng. Weicheng said, "Are you a local?" Wang Fengzi said, "Yes, is the guest looking for someone?" Weicheng said, "That's not it,

I'm asking you, is there a family named Chen in your town, with an old lady at home, and her son is in Shanghai, now the son is dead. There is a son and a daughter, both studying in Shanghai, and they live in the countryside for a few days during summer and winter vacations. Do you know this family?" Wang Fengzi scratched his hair and laughed, "Yes, there is such a family. This family is not far from the Zhu family in the Black Wall Gate. But this Old Lady Chen has never had any dealings with that family in the town, and her son never comes back all year round. What are you asking them for?" Weicheng said, "It's nothing, I'm just chatting." Wang Fengzi turned to leave, but the old woman swaggered in, bringing an old woman with her. Wang Fengzi said to the old woman, "You look for yourself, I'm not sure if the surname is Hua or Ye." Weicheng took a look and saw that it was indeed the old nanny of the Chen family. The old nanny also smiled and said, "Young Master Ye, are you living here? Our Miss Fang is back, and she's inviting you." Weicheng was unexpected, unsure whether he was surprised or happy, opened his mouth and asked, "Your Miss is back? Who else? Is the young master back too?" The old nanny said, "No, Miss Fang came back alone. Now, Miss Zhu from the Black Wall is also in our house." (247)

### A Reporter's Visit to the Divine Soldiers of the Gaoligong Mountains (1)

‚Äî Translated by Jiefeng

(Originally published in the Yomiuri Hochi on December 6th)

The Army Press Department of the General Headquarters dispatched Yomiuri Hochi reporter Yasushi Sano (from a certain place in China and Myanmar)

In the trenches on the front line of Yunnan

At this moment, I am in the trenches on the front line of Yunnan Province, sending this report to the motherland, which is increasingly burning with the belief in defeating the British and Americans on the first anniversary of the Greater East Asia War. When I open my eyes, there are mountains in front and behind, simply a screen of mountains standing tall. The vast clouds and smoke that match the name "Yunnan" cover these rugged mountains. Below, the Nu River flows continuously, bringing the ice and snow of the Himalayas from afar. A mountain dove is calling. Looking back, a sentinel, wet with morning mist and with his collar turned up, is walking towards me.

"The enemy is frightened and doesn't dare to come near. At first, the enemy planes flew very boldly, strafing our army's positions below; we were here, taking them by surprise and bombing them downwards. They were hit by artillery fire and fell down immediately. Shooting down enemy planes from above is really the most suitable place. The scenery here is very similar to Japan..."

The sentinel smiled, his white teeth shining in his beard.

This is a corner of the Gaoligong Mountains, which is connected to the Himalayas, originating from India and Tibet, and known as the roof of the world. Last night I slept here with five layers of blankets. Although it is the southern battlefield, it is completely winter weather here. The opposite bank, only 150 meters away, is piled with red soil, which is the enemy's front line. Without using binoculars, you can clearly see everything the opposing side does with a raise of their hand or a step of their foot. Neither firing nor being fired at, it is such a boring "first line." Mountains, mountains, mountains... stand in front of me. There is a horizontal road on the mountainside, which is the Yunnan-Myanmar Highway that enters the enemy's camp. The mountain in front of me was named by the Imperial Army as the Hachimaki Mountain, also known as Zhongshan. On the mountain road of that Hachimaki Mountain, many beetle-like enemy vehicles are buried, with more than 370 counted on this side of the mountain, and perhaps four times as many on the other side. These were all "gifts" left by the enemy when my Sakaguchi Brigade took advantage of the victory to pursue the enemy to the banks of the Nu River on May 5th, Boys' Day. Over the past six months, wind and rain have eroded these vehicles, and they have all rotted; now only the wreckage of some vehicles remains. On the Nu River is the Huiji Bridge, which is very famous. The "river width" is 50 meters, and the Nu River, which looks like it is flowing with brown dye in the rainy season, turns green in the dry season. Look! Isn't there morning frost shining white on the back of the sentinel who is stepping on the frost and surveying the enemy's camp! From the sentinel's back, I thought of the morning of December 8th a year ago, when 100 million people tearfully read the Imperial Rescript, vowing to support the Greater East Asia War‚Äîthe morning when the history of the dawn of East Asia began to be created.
