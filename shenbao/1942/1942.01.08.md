### Roosevelt Declares in Congress: Decides to Station Troops in the British Isles and Announces Production Program Costs Will Reach 56 Billion Dollars

Washington, 6th (Havas) – President Roosevelt, attending the first session of the 77th Congress today, delivered a message emphasizing that the British Isles are the most important base in the current war. The United States should send naval, ground, and air forces to assist in the battle. He also ordered all U.S. government agencies and organizations to step up war production in 1942, so that the production of military equipment would far exceed that of 1941. This differs significantly from the statement made by British Prime Minister Churchill when addressing the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives, who said that Britain would still not be fully prepared before 1943.

Washington, 7th (Reuters) – President Roosevelt, in a message to both houses of the 77th Congress yesterday, announced that the cost of the U.S. war program for this year would reach 56 billion dollars, and that the U.S. Army, Navy, and Air Force would be stationed in the British Isles. Roosevelt outlined the U.S. war production program as follows: In 1942, it is expected to produce 60,000 military aircraft, 45,000 tanks, 20,000 anti-aircraft guns, and 8 million tons of ships. In 1943, production will increase to 125,000 aircraft, 75,000 tanks, 35,000 anti-aircraft guns, and 10 million tons of ships. Roosevelt also spoke of the setbacks suffered by the U.S. military at the beginning of the war, saying, "We acknowledge that we have encountered difficult choices. For example, our failure to rescue Wake Island and our failure to send a thousand ships carrying a million soldiers to the Philippines is deeply regrettable, but this only strengthens our determination." Roosevelt then announced that U.S. troops must be sent to many parts of the world. Members of Congress listened with a serious and calm attitude. When the President specifically and emphatically stated that U.S. troops must be stationed in the British Isles, an important fortress in the world's struggle, even members of Congress who had opposed American youth participating in foreign wars for many years applauded.

Stockholm, 7th (Trans-Agency) – According to news from Washington, President Roosevelt said in a message to Congress yesterday afternoon, "When our resources are fully mobilized, we will launch an offensive. We must keep the war away from our country's coast because we will make this war take place in other people's countries. American troops will fight in many strongholds and the five oceans, but we must know that we must pay a very high price for freedom. To implement this plan, we must add new taxes, issue public bonds, and practice strict economy. We must pay a very high price, but no matter what this price is, even a thousand times, we must do it."

Washington, 7th (Reuters) – Washington newspapers published late editions, all prominently featuring President Roosevelt's remarks that U.S. troops would be sent to the British Isles and elsewhere in the world. The Times Herald's headline was "Roosevelt Plans to Send American Expeditionary Forces Worldwide." The Washington Daily News said, "President Tells Congress U.S. Army Will Go to Fight Everywhere, and Will Head to Britain." Democratic leader Senator McNary criticized the President's speech, saying, "This matter requires a lot of money. Every expense must be carefully examined." Democratic Senator Topey said, "I agree with every word of the President, and I especially agree with our plan to go all out under the President's program." Automobile magnate Henry Ford criticized the war production program, saying that this program not only guarantees that it can be completed, but also implies that the war may end in 1943.

Washington, 7th – The Army and Navy Departments announced last night, appealing to the national automobile industry to manufacture 500 million dollars worth of military supplies. The authorities hope that the manpower and machinery of the automobile industry can be fully utilized within 30 days. If this can be achieved, the war against the Axis can be ended 30 days earlier.

For three consecutive nights, Japanese aircraft have flown in after midnight under the bright moonlight, and fighter planes have harassed during the day. British and American fighter planes take to the skies day and night to fight back. Therefore, when Japanese aircraft attack during the day, they now only pay attention to the outskirts and vicinity of Rangoon. On Sunday night, the bombs dropped by Japanese aircraft seemed to be larger than those dropped on Saturday night. A communiqué issued yesterday by the British Army and Air Force stated, "An airfield near Rangoon was attacked at 1:15 a.m. this morning. Several aircraft participated, and there were no casualties."

### Washington Announces Draft Budget

Washington, 7th (Havas) – The draft budget for the fiscal year 1942-43 was released today. Expenditures are estimated at $58,927,992,000 (previous year: $30,575,793,000; year before: $12,710,629,000). Revenues are estimated at $16,487,200,000 (previous year: $2,943,993,000; year before: $7,607,211,000). The deficit is $42,440,792,000 (previous year: $18,631,803,000; year before: $5,103,417,000). Of the expenditures, $52,786,186,000 is for national defense. President Roosevelt declared to Congress that at the end of 1941, the national defense plan required a total of $75,000,000,000, with $4,000,000,000 still to be contracted. As for the new budget, the initial funding will be $13,600,000,000, and will be gradually increased as the quantity of military equipment contracted increases. At this time, I cannot predict the final cost of this plan, because I cannot foresee how the war situation will change. I can only say that we must maintain our way of life at any cost. Currently, total war expenses require $2,000,000,000 per month and will soon increase to $5,000,000,000. This astonishing expenditure is for the manufacture of merchant ships, aircraft and military supplies. Therefore, a large part of our country's industrial organization needs to be reformed immediately. At least half of the national production will be devoted to the war effort. In terms of annual income, we can increase revenue by increasing taxes by $7,000,000,000, and the rest can be made up from developing economic tariffs and other taxes. In short, any financial obstacles are not enough to stop our war effort and our victory. Finally, we must also take various steps to prevent a post-war economic crisis and avoid repeating the mistakes after World War I.

Saigon, 6th (Domei) – Van Mook, the Deputy Governor of the Dutch East Indies, arrived in Canberra on the 6th and held talks with Australian Prime Minister Curtin. The issue discussed was the unified command of the Southwest Pacific.

Sydney, 6th (Havas) – The Sydney Sun published an editorial today stating that if the Allied powers intend to establish any committee to decide on the Pacific war plan and control the activities of the supreme commander, then the Australian Commonwealth should also send representatives to participate in this organization. It is generally known here that such a committee will soon be established in London to work with General Wavell, Commander-in-Chief of the Allied Forces in the Southwest Pacific. So far, General Wavell is only responsible to Prime Minister Churchill and President Roosevelt.

Berlin, 7th (Haitong) – The Berlin newspapers this morning paid special attention to the events of the US military protecting Australia and obtaining Australian naval and air bases. The People's Observer commented on this, saying that the US and Australia have been negotiating a military agreement and the transfer of bases for quite some time. The British government was only notified after Prime Minister Churchill arrived in Washington. The first result of the agreement was that Britain had no choice but to place Australia outside the command range of General Wavell, the Anglo-American Allied Commander-in-Chief of the Southwest Pacific. Diplomatic circles in Washington paid special attention to this agreement, and even said that Australia is no longer part of the British Empire, but only the 49th state of the United States.

London Concerned about the Situation in East Asia

Stockholm, 7th (Haitong Agency Reporter Tangen) – Political figures in London believe that General Wavell's headquarters moving from Singapore to Surabaya indicates that Singapore has been included in the front-line area. The loss of the Kuantan airfield caused Singapore to lose extremely valuable protection and had to look for a substitute to replace this main British base. However, those related to Britain admit that this substitute is difficult to find, because Singapore's defense works took five years to complete, and its huge dock for repairing ships is unmatched elsewhere. The selection of Surabaya as the location of the general headquarters was also a last resort. Now that British reinforcements have arrived on the Malay front, London hopes that Singapore's position can be slightly improved as a result. The news of the American aircraft attacking the Japanese fleet off the coast of the Philippines made London feel slightly excited. American military expert Baldwin wrote in the "Evening Standard" on January 6 that the American air raid on Tarakan may indicate that American reinforcements will continue to arrive in the East. The base of the American air force may be in the Dutch East Indies. If the strength of the American air force can be strengthened, then the superiority of the Japanese air force in the area may be slightly threatened. Recently, rumors in London say that a large American naval force is heading towards East Asia, but this has not yet been confirmed.

### Egypt Severes Diplomatic Relations with Bulgaria and Finland

After landing at the airport, he changed to a car to the naval port and boarded a warship to set sail. Churchill is expected to return to England on the 9th, and it is expected that Churchill will deliver a statement to the House of Commons after returning home.

### Shanghai Municipal Council Forms Mediation Committee to Handle Rent Disputes; Forcible Evictions or Rent Increases Generally Not Allowed; Cases Already Under Court Review Will Not Be Intervened In

According to the information from the Shanghai Municipal Council's Situation Department, there seems to be some misunderstanding regarding the recent organization of the Rent Dispute Mediation Committee by the Council. It is hereby clarified as follows: The basic work of the committee is outlined in the Council's Public Notice No. 5700, which states in summary, "Due to the current difficult times, property owners, when collecting due rent from tenants who are facing economic hardship or reduced income and are struggling to pay, should treat them reasonably. If possible, property owners should allow tenants to postpone rent payments or temporarily reduce rent. Before March 31, 1944, forcible evictions are generally not allowed in the aforementioned circumstances. All rent increases between December 8, 1941, and March 31, 1942, are invalid. Furthermore, if disputes arise between property owners and tenants, they should be resolved peacefully, and strong measures or legal action should be avoided. If the disputes between the two parties cannot be resolved through direct negotiation, the cases should be submitted to the Council's Mediation Committee for review."

Organizing Committee Responsible for Mediation

The committee has now been established, and the committee members are Ge Letai, Ba Ruishan, Beilun Tuo Bolian, Li Shuxiong, and Li Zhishan. The detailed matters of the committee will be handled by the Council's Legal Department. Any complaints from property owners against tenants or from tenants against property owners should be submitted to the Legal Department, which will then forward them to the Mediation Committee for review. The committee's operating procedures are outlined in the Council's Public Notice No. 5731. The following points should be noted when interpreting the contents of the above two public notices:

Applications for Rent Increases Cannot Be Accepted

The Mediation Committee can adjudicate disputes between property owners and tenants, but has no authority to consider disputes between second landlords and third tenants. Disputes between second landlords and third tenants are hoped to be handled in another way (see below). The Mediation Committee cannot accept applications from property owners to increase rent. As stated in the Council's Public Notice No. 5700, all rent increases between December 8, 1941, and March 31, 1942, are invalid.

Refusal to Pay Rent Can Be Referred for Mediation

If a tenant refuses to pay rent, the property owner can request the Mediation Committee to review the case. If a tenant is unable to pay rent due to economic difficulties, they can also submit the case to the committee for review. The committee will consider whether the rent should be reduced, temporarily suspended, or paid in full. The Mediation Committee is not a court and cannot overturn the judgments of competent courts. Therefore, it cannot intervene in cases that have already been judged by competent courts or are still under trial.

Third Tenants Will Be Handled Separately

Cases submitted to the Mediation Committee should be limited to those that cannot be resolved through direct negotiation. As for the Council's handling of the relationship between landlords and third tenants, it plans to formulate an additional clause to the Land Regulations for handling this matter. This additional clause will be submitted to the Consular Body for approval. The proposed additional clause stipulates the following two measures: Landlords should obtain licenses, and the relationship between landlords and third tenants will be handled in accordance with the license regulations. The collection of gratuities is prohibited. Once the provisions of the above additional clause are passed by the Council and approved by the Consular Body, they will be implemented.

### Shanghai Municipal Council Advocates for Group Cooking System

In order to save fuel, the Shanghai Municipal Council has advocated for a "group cooking" system and sent a letter to various clan associations yesterday (7th) requesting their unanimous support and promotion in order to achieve its implementation. The original letter is recorded below: "To whom it may concern, in order to save fuel in the city and avoid the excessive fuel consumption of individual families cooking separately, the Council has proposed the 'group cooking' initiative. We sincerely hope that your association will review this issue and encourage its promotion. In fact, if ten or more families can cook together, fuel consumption can be reduced by approximately 35% to 50%. Recently, the city has experienced a gradual shortage of fuel, and the situation is serious. Your association will surely strive to promote this group cooking initiative and facilitate its implementation, which will not only benefit individual economies but also save a significant amount of fuel for the entire city. In addition to sending separate letters, we hereby inform you and hope that you will take note and implement accordingly."

### Over 250,000 Citizens Returned to Their Native Places in January

### Shanghai Municipal Council Formally Announces Restrictions on Rice Shops; 250 Allowed to Exist, Providing Large Quantities, Selling in Two Groups

From the 10th of this month, the number of rice shops in the Public Concession will be reduced by more than half, with only 250 allowed to exist. The locations and license numbers have been approved and announced by the Municipal Council Board of Directors (listed separately). The remaining rice shops will be limited to closing by 4:00 PM on the 9th of this month. Regarding the 250 licensed rice shops, the amount of foreign rice allocated by the Municipal Council will be greatly increased from the 10th of this month. Therefore, the time for selling cheap rice at rice shops can be extended, and the current state of scrambling and congestion will inevitably disappear. However, the limit on retail purchases per person will not be canceled and will remain at three liters. The sale of foreign rice will be divided into two groups, with 125 shops in each group. For example, Group A will simultaneously retail foreign rice on Mondays, Wednesdays, Fridays, and odd-numbered days, while Group B will simultaneously retail on Tuesdays, Thursdays, Saturdays, and even-numbered days. The previous regulation of suspending the sale of foreign rice on Wednesdays will be canceled. The locations and license numbers of the rice shops that will be allowed to continue operating after the 10th of this month, as approved by the Municipal Council Board of Directors, are listed below:

986 Avenue Edward VII

125 Chengdu Road

Commercial News

### Only Piece Goods Are Most Profitable – Factory Cloth Is Scarce, and East Piece Goods Are Booming

Yesterday, the market for factory cloth continued to rise due to the lack of spot goods. Sixteen-pound Butterfly coarse cloth opened at 111 yuan, and Double Elephant coarse cloth was quoted at 108 or 109 yuan, but there were no spot goods. Fourteen-pound Ewo coarse cloth was 88 yuan, eleven-pound was 76 yuan and 50 cents, and nine-pound was 66 yuan. The demand from local retail stores was particularly high, but there was a lack of supply. Transactions amounted to one hundred and several dozen bales.

East cloth first fell and then rose, and the trend was firm and stable. The morning market for fine cloth fell by about two yuan per piece. The leading factory's single afternoon closing price dropped to 87 yuan and 80 cents. Later, due to purchases from local and out-of-town merchants, the middle and lower grades rebounded, so the closing price of the leading fine cloth was 89 yuan and 75 cents, which was still extremely scarce. The minimum price for Rainbow Ball fine cloth was 84 yuan and 25 cents, which also rose back to 86 yuan. Four Gentlemen's Serge new orders sold at a low price of 3 yuan, 10 cents, 6 and 7 cents, and rose again to 3 yuan, 20 cents, 5 and a half cents at the evening closing, an increase of one cent.

### Woolen Cloth Wholesale Prices Are Cheap

Woolen cloth transactions slightly expanded yesterday. Retail and wholesale prices were quite inconsistent, with two prices offered for inquiries. For retail and single-piece transactions, sellers remained opportunistic and refused to lower prices. However, for wholesale transactions of three or four boxes, worth tens of thousands of yuan, sellers were willing to offer special discounts. For example, if selling one or two pieces of "Party List," the price would be 43 or 44 yuan, not less. If selling 30 or 40 pieces, a price of 35 or 36 yuan could be obtained. This also reflects the painful inside story of the woolen cloth market recently.

### Cotton Yarn Is Mostly Stabilized – Prices Rebound from Weakness

The cotton yarn situation tended to be flat at first, then declined, but finally rebounded. However, trading volume was not as strong as the previous day. However, most dealers' attitudes were relatively stable, so the situation was quite calm. The morning opening price for 20-count Horse brand was 2,160 yuan. Later, due to the rush of sellers and weakened sentiment, the price gradually eased to 2,110 yuan. However, as prices weakened, profit-takers covered their positions, and the market gradually recovered to 2,145 yuan. However, trading on the floor was scarce, and the two sides held out for a long time. Until the closing, the momentum turned strong and gradually rose to 2,175 yuan, due to the rebound in gold prices. 42-count Blue Phoenix was 4,140 yuan, falling to 4,020 yuan. 20-count Moon Harp was 2,250 yuan to 2,280 yuan. 20-count Red Kui Xing was 2,220 yuan. 20-count Blue Phoenix was 2,545 yuan. 20-count Abundant Year was 2,650 yuan. 20-count Heavenly Maiden was 2,660 yuan. Double Globe was 2,020 yuan to 1,970 yuan. 10-count De Li was 1,360 yuan. 6-count Red Great Happiness was 1,625 yuan. 6-count Rouge Tiger was 1,800 yuan. 40-count Heavenly Maiden was 3,500 yuan. 16-count Golden Pagoda was 1,790 yuan.

### Gold Still Being Absorbed

Yesterday's cash black market fluctuated and rebounded, with prices exceeding the 12,000 yuan mark. A certain gold firm first sold and then repurchased, and sentiment was still stable. From the morning, the price rose with buying pressure, and the initial transaction price was 12,250 yuan per tael (ten liang), reaching a high of 450 yuan. A certain cash firm and Sheng Da Yong came to absorb, and retail investors followed suit, continuing to rise by 250 yuan, reaching 12,500 yuan. A certain gold firm and money changers were excited, and cash firms also competed to sell. When the price fell back, retail longs liquidated and buyers waited and watched, and the price plunged 800 yuan, falling to 11,700 yuan. A certain money shop absorbed and the price rose again, rising to 11,950 yuan by 11 o'clock. Later, a certain gold firm suddenly rose and repurchased, and the rise was even faster at noon, rising by 350 yuan, reaching 12,300 yuan at noon, a rebound of 500 yuan from the previous day's final price, with a high-low difference of 800 yuan. Transactions amounted to 500 or 600 taels. The exchange price for gold jewelry at Dashin and other silver shops was raised by 50 yuan per tael, calculated at 1,300 yuan, and the purchase price was reduced by 100 yuan. Standard silver was nominally quoted at 16 yuan, and the black market price was 10 yuan for transactions.

### Cash Abundant Daily – Talk of Investigating Chinese Merchant Deposits

The foreign exchange market slightly firmed. US dollar bills rebounded to 17 yuan and 20 cents, and Hong Kong dollar bills were 2 yuan and 85 cents, with transactions. Military scrip rose to 3 yuan and 82 cents. British gold pounds were needed at 290 yuan, and US gold pounds were quoted at the above price plus 5 yuan.

The discount rate for remittance and draft bills was still 3 yuan per thousand yuan or flat. The interbank rate of the Money Industry Association remained at 6 cents. However, Chinese merchant banks had more cash reserves, so the discount rate may be closer in the future.

It is rumored that the investigation of foreign bank deposits will be completed, so there is talk of investigating Chinese merchant bank deposits. The investigation is for account names, nationalities, and deposit amounts as of December 6, limited to deposits of 50,000 yuan or more. This is currently only a rumor, but most deposits in Chinese merchant banks are owned by Chinese, and there are few foreign deposits, so nationality is not of concern.

### No Worry of Suspension of Interest on Public Bonds

The over-the-counter market for public bonds was still active and not deserted. Wen Yi and Tong Kang were still willing to buy, and did not worry about the suspension of principal and interest. Market prices were still very firm. Type A initially traded at 63 yuan and 50 cents, once rising to 4 yuan and 20 cents, and closed at 64 yuan, 70 or 80 cents higher than before. Type B was 60 yuan and 7 cents, then rose to 1 yuan and 20 cents, up 70 or 80 cents. Type C initially traded at 60 yuan and 6 cents, then fell to 59 yuan and 80 cents, and closed above 60 yuan, at 45 cents, also up 20 or 30 cents. Type D was 56 yuan and 56 cents, also up half a yuan from before. Type E was from 58 yuan to 8 yuan and 40 cents, slightly better by 20 cents. Transactions amounted to about 200,000 or 300,000 yuan.

The over-the-counter market for foreign stocks was quite lively, but trading was restricted to Chinese account names. Jardine Matheson had sellers at 62 yuan, and Ye Guang had transactions at 13 yuan and 70 cents. The buying and selling prices of Asia Shipyard were 9 yuan and 50 cents and 10 yuan. British American Tobacco had a buying price of 19 yuan and 50 cents, and sellers started at 20 yuan. Tramways had buyers at 29 yuan. Ewo Spinning had a selling price of 28 yuan, and buyers countered at 27 yuan and 50 cents. Sino-British Spinning was 7 yuan, with many sellers. Shanghai Woolen was 1 yuan and 50 cents, with buyers. Reclamation was 21 yuan and 50 cents, and Langezhi was 13 yuan, all buying prices. Paper was 6 yuan and 30 cents, with supply but no demand. There were no prices for the rest.

### Imported Rice Arrivals and Sales Are Both Scarce

After the sudden reduction in the source of imported rice, although yesterday's market price rebounded once, the previous few days of continuous dumping caused prices to fall through. Generally, cargo owners turned to wait and see due to the lack of profit in transportation, and most of them were still suspended. Therefore, yesterday's arrivals at the port were only more than 120 dan. At the same time, on the sales side, due to the authorities' plan to reduce the number of rice shops by more than 300, the 250 rice shops will implement the universal sale of foreign rice in the near future. Before the official announcement, the shops inevitably suspended purchases, so demand was also sluggish. However, cargo owners' willingness to sell was still firm due to yesterday's rebound, so the highest price for early rice was once quoted at 289 yuan, but it finally fell back to 270 yuan due to sluggish sales. The next best was 256 yuan. Although the whole market had fluctuations of more than 2 yuan, the final result can be called a settlement. Other items such as thick japonica only had 10 dan of Kunshan second-grade japonica, priced at 222 yuan. As for imported glutinous rice, sales were not widespread and were all flat at 220 yuan. There were no imports or exports of foreign rice, but it was reported that a French company would be arranging a ship to transport broken rice, and the foreign rice in storage in the city would also be distributed to rice shops for public sale as much as possible, in order to reduce the current serious situation.

### About Charcoal Cars

— Lin Feng

Since the implementation of gasoline rationing, Shanghai's transportation has been greatly affected. As a result, some people have advocated using charcoal to replace gasoline, and the Public Works Department has experts engaged in research. This has indeed attracted a lot of attention from all parties. We will take this opportunity to talk about the common knowledge of charcoal cars, which should not be superfluous.

Charcoal cars are not a new invention. Before the war, the cars on the Sujia Highway in China used charcoal combustion. In recent years, wars have broken out around the world, causing a phenomenon of gasoline demand exceeding supply. Thus, countries like Japan and the Chinese mainland have successively adopted charcoal cars to save gasoline consumption.

The structure of a charcoal car is not complicated. Its task is only to extract carbon gas to replace gasoline for combustion, so when a car is converted into a charcoal car, its engine remains unchanged. Regarding the structure of carbon gas extraction, most of them are a stove made of a five-centimeter thick iron plate, with a lid on the top to add charcoal, a door hole below, a bellows on one side to aid combustion, and a pipe on the other side to transport carbon gas. The pipe then passes through two gas filter buckets, one with iron filings and the other with several layers of wood charcoal and other devices. The function of these two buckets is to filter the carbon gas transported from the furnace, otherwise it will cause engine problems. After the charcoal car is installed, it still needs a very small amount of gasoline to guide its combustion, because the combustion power of carbon gas is weak. When driving, the speed does not change much, but the weight-carrying trucks will be reduced, especially at the beginning, there will be great difficulties.

Drivers of charcoal cars must understand the structure of charcoal cars, such as adding charcoal at the appropriate time, and how to reduce the waste of charcoal when stopping, etc.

Due to space limitations, I would like to pause here for now. Some friends are also engaged in production, and it is expected that more specific and practical village materials will be announced to readers soon. Only I contribute

### Bai Yushuang Perishes Like Fragrant Jade

— Only I contribute

People in Shanghai probably all know Bai Yushuang, the "Queen of Ping Opera" who sings Bengbeng opera in Beijing. Now I want to tell you that this Bai boss has perished like fragrant jade and died of illness in the old capital.

I think many people will find the above news strange, but this is not "Dongpo's Overseas" talk, let me tell you slowly.

The fact is that since Bai Yushuang returned north from Shanghai after the war, she has been popular until now. In the process, she accumulated a lot of money. She herself thought that the golden age of selling art could only last so long, so she had long made up her mind to choose someone to marry. There is a barbershop on Wangfujing Street in Dongcheng, Beijing. The owner of this barbershop is a fan of Bai's art. Over time, they developed a relationship, and from love to engagement, the two sides have made a lifelong commitment. Bai Yushuang planned to sing for another year, clean up her affairs, and then retire. This spring, she first hired out her adopted daughter, Little Bai Yushuang, at a price of 100,000 yuan; later, she refused to renew her contract with the Kaiming Theater, and after the Kaiming contract expired, she went to Tianjin to perform. These were all signs that she was preparing to retire. Unexpectedly, heaven did not bless people. After she returned to Beijing from performing in Tianjin, she fell ill and even became seriously ill.

It is said that Bai Yushuang's illness was caused by the intense feelings of the unmarried couple, which led to a hidden illness. When she was sent to the hospital for treatment, the doctor examined her and did not dare to determine whether her life was in danger. The next day was December 8, the day of her death, which happened to be the outbreak of the war. The doctor at the hospital could not come to the hospital for treatment. After this delay, Yushuang's illness became incurable and she passed away.

(Editor's note: It is said that Zhu Baoxia, who once competed with Bai Yushuang, has recently developed a bad habit and is down and out in Shanghai. From then on, "Widow Ma Opening a Shop" and "Hanging the Little Old Woman" have become a thing of the past!)

### The Earliest Illusion

— Ze Fu

Illusion is what is now called magic. In the Song Dynasty, it was also called Zang Xie. The Wenxian Tongkao says, "Taking objects and concealing them in the bosom, so that the audience cannot see the mechanism." This art was first introduced from abroad. Shiyiji says that in the seventh year of King Cheng of Zhou, people from the southern border of Fulou were good at ingenuity and could create clouds and fog and spit people out on their palms, twisting and bending them between their fingers. This statement is very strange and cannot be done by non-illusionists. During the reign of Emperor Wu of Han, Zhang Qian was sent to the Western Regions. When he returned, a man from Lixuan followed him to Han. This man was good at illusions and could spit fire from his mouth and untie himself when bound. This was the earliest introduction of illusions into China. Lixuan is now Alexandria, Egypt, which at that time belonged to Rome. In ancient China, it was called the Great Qin Kingdom. Later, there were also planting melons and trees, and slaughtering people and cutting horses, which are still done by performers today and do not need to be described in detail. In the Qing Dynasty, there were also transporters. For example, the Yue Wei Caotang Notes says, "When I was a child at my grandfather's house, a magician held a large bowl of fish slices and threw it into the air and disappeared. When asked to retrieve it, he said it was in the drawer of the painting cabinet in the study. At that time, the study was strictly locked, and the drawer was only two inches wide, while the bowl was three or four inches high, so it was impossible to enter. Suspecting that he was lying, I called for the key to open it and looked. The bowl was placed on the table, replaced with five Buddha hands. The plate originally containing Buddha hands was replaced with fish slices, hidden in the drawer. Isn't this a transportation technique?" In fact, this is also a kind of illusion. The magician deliberately made a show to tease him.

### "Wu" Girl's Wedding

— Ming

### Lafayette: "Home"

— Mu Feng

"Xilimen" is the first play performed by the "Shangzhi" and "Shangju" organizations at the Lafayette Theater. Originally named "Marriage," it is a work by Gogol, so the entire play is full of humorous and satirical jokes. Before the main play, the one-act play "You're Crazy" is added. This is also a comedy. Xia Ling, played by Huang Zongying, is a drama fan, so like Mr. Wu Yin in "The Opera Fan's Biography," she imitates the voices and movements of several famous actors. Among them, learning Yingzi's Mingfeng in "Home" is the most deified.

Yingzi's Mingfeng was indeed famous for a time when "Home" was performed publicly. Mr. Zhou Xinfang said that she had completely melted the soul of Mingfeng and could express her full of depressed emotions. Lafayette is going to perform "Home" again this time, and I believe that audiences who have seen it more than once will go to appreciate it again. This is because "Home" does have a great transformative power. It is said that when "Home" is restaged this time, someone suggested inviting Mr. Zhou Xinfang to play the role of the eldest brother Juexin as a guest. Although this is a joke and far from the truth, if it really happens, the Ban Lin fans will flock to see it.

### Begonia

— Qin Shouou

Sixteen Youthful Fire

In these few years, Xiangqi has enjoyed a material life comparable to that of the Yuan family, and spiritually, she has received the consolation she had not received for a long time after losing her lover and daughter. Unconsciously, Xiangqi's body has become much healthier than before.

Because she had too much free time, and she herself had no interest in going out to find any entertainment, she voluntarily took on the responsibility of supervising the education of Shao Hua from her elder brother and sister-in-law from the first year she arrived in Shanghai.

Shao Hua was the only son born to Yuhua in the first year of their marriage. Of course, the couple loved him very much, but fortunately, this child was very honest in nature. Although his parents loved him very much, and the family's situation became richer day by day, he had not yet become an embroidered pillow. Xiangqi found him not annoying at first sight. Although he did not look as delicate as the average Shanghai standard young man, there was a kind of heroic spirit in his eyebrows; although he could not get the first or second place in school, his average score was always above passing. When Xiangqi guided him to review his homework at home, she also discovered that his comprehension was very high. He could immediately understand anything after being taught once; therefore, from the first year of junior high school until Shao Hua graduated from high school, Xiangqi had been very serious and happily working as his home teacher.

"You are going to university in the second half of the year. I won't be able to teach you the lessons after that!" One night, when Xiangqi was going to bed, she looked at this young man who was growing up year by year and was almost taller than herself, and said this very casually.

"No, I still have to ask my aunt for guidance every day!" Shao Hua said with a strange attachment.

Before Xiangqi could say anything else, Yuhua's wife interjected. (297)
