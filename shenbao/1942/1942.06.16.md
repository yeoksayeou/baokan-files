### Breakthrough of Soviet Defenses at Sevastopol Port; Unprecedented Air Battle Between the Two Sides' Air Forces; German Forces Complete Their Mission in the Kharkov Region

Berlin, 15th (Haitong News Agency) - The German High Command announced that several Soviet strongholds south of Sevastopol had been occupied by German forces, and the Soviet forces were driven out of their defensive areas. The defensive line around Sevastopol has been breached by German forces.

Fourteenth Day, Führer's Headquarters (Haitong News Agency) - This afternoon's German war report stated that in the battles around Sevastopol, German forces repeatedly achieved meritorious deeds. Several strong fortresses in the south, despite stubborn resistance from the defending forces, were eventually forced to retreat. Our infantry took advantage of the victory to pursue and penetrate deeply into the enemy's defensive line. German fighter groups protected the escort fighter groups in a major battle with Soviet aircraft, shooting down sixteen enemy planes. All German aircraft safely returned to their original positions. The remnants of the enemy in the Kharkov region have either been captured or annihilated, bringing the number of prisoners to 25,000. 266 enemy tanks and 108 artillery pieces were destroyed. The German-Hungarian allied forces repeatedly defeated enemy forces east of Kursk. Our forces operating in the central and northern sectors are making smooth progress.

Berlin, 15th (Haitong News Agency) - Military circles here point out that the purpose of the large-scale German offensive east of Kharkov was to reduce the pressure on Soviet forces moving south and north. The German forces have now achieved victory and completed the above mission.

The Eastern Front War Reaches its First Anniversary; Victory or Defeat Still Hangs in the Balance

Stockholm, 14th (Havas News Agency) - The German-Soviet war has entered its 52nd week, and victory or defeat is still undecided. The military special correspondent of Havas World News Agency has recently compiled war reports from various sources and analyzed the situation on the Eastern Front. "The Kharkov Campaign" - The Red Army's counter-offensive against Kharkov last month failed, and its main forces were surrounded. A portion of them retreated across the Donets River. Since then, they have maintained a "bridgehead" position on the left bank of the river. However, German forces launched a new offensive in the area five days ago, reportedly occupying this bridgehead. Since then, the situation may take a sharp turn. As for the new Red Army positions in the area, the Soviet authorities remain tight-lipped, and outsiders have no way of finding out. "The Sevastopol Campaign" - The battle for this port is extremely fierce. The German side claims to have occupied 645 bunkers, but the Red Army continues to hold out in the remaining bunkers. The terrain in the area is rugged, making it difficult for German mechanized units to advance, and the infantry is especially vulnerable to ambushes. German forces encounter a trap every thirteen yards. The Red Army there is determined to coexist with its positions, and its style is no different from that of the Red and Black in Kursk. In other words, they can let the German forces break through the Red Army positions, but after the German forces complete their initial attack, they will attack from behind, regardless of their own life or death. Various defensive fortifications in the city have been severely damaged by German dive bombers and artillery fire. However, tens of thousands of mines are still buried in the outer perimeter, which makes the German forces fearful. The battles on the central and northern fronts are temporarily limited to local operations. Both sides want to adjust their existing positions. The German forces' attack is still aimed at Leningrad and Murmansk.

### Japanese Imperial Headquarters Releases Supplementary Report on Midway Island Battle Results; Darwin Port Suffers Heavy Bombing by Japanese Aircraft; Evacuation of Women and Children Begins in Sydney Port

Tokyo, 15th (Allied News Agency) - The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 4:30 PM on the 15th a supplementary report on the results of the Japanese Navy's attack on Midway Island as follows: The sinking of one U.S. "Old Yu Shan No. 1" class battleship and one U.S. submarine. It has also been confirmed that 150 enemy aircraft were shot down during the attack. Note that the U.S. "San Francisco" class battleship was completed in February of 1939, with a displacement of 9,950 tons, a speed of 33 knots, nine 8-inch main guns, eight 5-inch anti-aircraft guns, two aircraft launching devices, four aircraft, and a crew of 594.

Buenos Aires, 14th (Allied News Agency) - According to a telegram from Melbourne, the Allied Headquarters here has released a report stating that a large formation of Japanese aircraft heavily attacked Darwin Military Port on the 13th. Since the port was first attacked on January 19th, this bombing was the most intense. At the same time, the "AC" radio station's correspondent in Darwin issued the following report on the heavy damage caused by the Japanese air force's daring attack on Darwin Port that day: On the morning of the 13th, a large formation of Japanese air force broke the peaceful dawn of Darwin Port, appearing successively in the sky above the area and rapidly descending to bomb the airfield and other military facilities there. Strong explosive bombs and incendiary bombs fell like rain, and low-altitude strafing was carried out. Fires broke out immediately wherever incendiary bombs landed. Although the fire brigade desperately tried to extinguish them, they continued to burn for several hours. Although the extent of the damage has not yet been announced, judging from the situation of the bombing, it can be determined that the airfield and other military port facilities have suffered significant damage.

Tokyo, 15th (Allied News Agency) - According to the "Nichi Nichi Shimbun" quoting Sydney news, the Australian government, in view of the recent bombardment of Sydney and Newcastle by Japanese submarines, has decided to evacuate women and children from Sydney.

### U.S. Military Supplies, Lend-Lease Situation; President Reports to Congress

Buenos Aires, 15th (Allied News Agency) - According to news from Washington, U.S. President Roosevelt submitted a report to Congress yesterday on lend-lease activities, acknowledging that the closure of the Burma Road has greatly worsened the difficulties of U.S. transportation. The report stated briefly that transportation difficulties reached their peak due to the closure of Burma, which is a limiting factor on the amount of aid to Chongqing. However, new methods of transporting large quantities of aid to Chongqing are being developed. President Roosevelt did not elaborate on this, nor did he mention what new methods are being used to solve the problems currently facing Chongqing, namely replenishing its gradually diminishing war supplies. President Roosevelt's report also stated, "The urgent problem at present is to allocate our weapons to the places where they are most needed, and to ensure that sufficient weapons reach those places in the shortest possible time. Combat distribution is "at a critical stage." This statement reflects the shortage of American ships, which has disrupted overseas transportation.

### A Second Imminent Great War Between Britain and Germany; The Fate of Libya is at Stake; Battle in the Triangular Zone Underway; British Firmly Defend El Adem Position

Somewhere on the Libyan Border, 14th (Havas News Agency) - Military observers here recently stated that the ultimate fate of Libya will hinge on the outcome of the "Second Tank Battle." This battle is currently taking place in the triangular zone between Knightsbridge, El Adem, and Acroma. The main objective of the German forces is to approach the coast somewhere between Gazala and Tobruk. Tobruk is regarded as an impregnable city and one of the best ports in North Africa. The British positions are mainly defensive, extending for 18 miles from the El Adem airfield to Knightsbridge. One end of this line is connected to the Tobruk port defenses, and the other end is connected to Capuzzo. According to the latest news, the Axis forces have established strong positions along the El Adem to Knightsbridge road, and it is even said that they have advanced east of that road. However, the fighting in that area has not yet reached a focal point. While the Axis forces are fighting in the Knightsbridge area, they are also launching a strong frontal attack on the Gazala area. Fresh British forces have been reinforced there, but the Tobruk garrison does not appear to have participated in the major battle. According to Allied sources, both sides have concentrated large forces, and their strength is comparable to that of the previous "Trap War." However, it is also a fact that most of the desert area south of Knightsbridge has fallen into German hands since the fall of Bir Hakeim. At the same time, the air force is also unusually active. British aircraft are doing everything they can to bomb the German-Italian supply lines. It is said that this supply line is extremely long, which is not the case for the British. The British Eighth Army's supply stations are close to the battlefield and have good roads and expanding railways leading to them.

Stockholm, 14th (Havas News Agency) - Swiss newspapers quote London news stating that London authorities are quite anxious about the fighting in Cyrenaica, North Africa. In the past few days, the Axis forces have rapidly advanced northward, with a great momentum to conquer Tobruk. However, according to London military experts, we cannot be sure whether that port is the real target of Rommel's forces. The main objective of the Axis forces is to annihilate the British armored units defending the El Gazala, Acroma, Knightsbridge, and Hamaat areas. So far, these units are still firmly defending El Adem. Also, a correspondent from the "Swiss Newspaper" in London reports that if the British forces on the African front can maintain their supply lines, they may still be able to push eastward. If an offensive can be launched simultaneously in Syria or Palestine or the Mediterranean, the chances of success of this attempt will naturally be greater. Conversely, once Germany overcomes the Soviet Union, its crisis will become even more pressing. Therefore, the North African Libyan battles and the Eastern Front's Sevastopol and Kharkov battles must be regarded as equivalent.

Heavy Sandstorms in North Africa; Unclear Battlefield Situation

Stockholm, 14th (Haitong News Agency) - A war report from Cairo received in London states that after the German-Italian allied forces captured Bir Hakeim, the offensive has not ended, but due to heavy sandstorms, the exact situation in the war zone is not very clear. However, many people in London feel anxious and uneasy. Yesterday, the London Times pointed out that the German army's supply transportation line is closely defended, so this German offensive is actually more dangerous than the previous several offensives. If General Auchinleck cannot stop the German army's advance, then Egypt will feel threatened.

Berlin, 15th (Dentsu News Agency) - A message received last night from the German High Command stated that after conquering the North African desert fortress of Bir Hakeim, the Axis forces have now obtained a base from which to launch future operations. The current climate in North Africa is hot and dry, with blowing sand and rocks, but there are also heavy rainstorms from time to time. The fighting is taking place under these conditions. According to the latest news, General Rommel's forces are currently operating west of El Adem. Adem is located northeast of Bir Hakeim, about 40 kilometers away. That area is also known for its battles. Now that the German-Italian allied forces have occupied Bir Hakeim, they can immediately continue to advance northward. As for the overall situation in North Africa, the initiative has always been in the hands of the Axis forces. On June 2nd, British Prime Minister Churchill read General Auchinleck's report in the House of Commons, confirming that the minefields laid by the British had been destroyed by the Axis forces from the south. Hakeim is not a plain but a mountainous area, and the terrain is very suitable for defense. Therefore, that area is the southernmost pillar of the British defense line. Therefore, the battle of Hakeim was quite fierce, with both sides sending heavy weapons and large armies to determine the outcome. The Axis forces benefited from their air superiority, which determined the outcome of this battle, defeating the British forces and occupying the area. Axis aircraft also contributed to disrupting British shipping in the Mediterranean. The German navy attacked British convoys sailing to Tobruk, sinking a total of 18,000 tons of enemy ships and heavily damaging four transport ships. German submarines have a dual mission in the Mediterranean: to disrupt enemy shipping and to protect the Axis convoys. This North African campaign has captured 12,000 enemy troops, 600 tanks and armored vehicles, 300 artillery pieces, and a large number of vehicles.

British Supply Routes Heavily Bombed by German Aircraft

Berlin, 15th (Haitong News Agency) - Authoritative sources here stated yesterday that German aircraft heavily attacked the enemy's base areas on the North African front on Saturday night, paying particular attention to the Mersa Matruh area. Many large fires broke out there, and many searchlight positions were destroyed.

Stockholm, 15th (Haitong News Agency) - News received in London last night from Cairo states that German aircraft are still targeting the British supply routes in Egypt on the North African front for bombing. The supply route between Alexandria and Mersa Matruh is particularly heavily bombed by German aircraft. London sources believe that General Rommel seems to be trying to prevent the British forces from transporting supplies from Egypt.

Valletta, Malta, 14th (Havas News Agency) - An official communiqué released today states that a small number of enemy bombers flew over the island last night, bombing various target locations. Our anti-aircraft artillery immediately returned fire. Today, a small team of enemy fighter planes flew to the skies over the island. Our anti-aircraft artillery immediately engaged them. As a result, our aircraft suffered no damage, and there was no damage to personnel or materials.

### Rumor that Anglo-Soviet Alliance Contains Secret Clauses; Understanding Reached on Border Issues

Berlin, 14th (Allied News Agency) - Although Article 5 of the Anglo-Soviet Treaty states that the principle of not expanding territory should be respected, it does not clearly state the fate of the Baltic states, eastern Poland, Bessarabia, and northern Bukovina, which were annexed by the Soviet Union before the German-Soviet war. According to the German News Agency's Stockholm dispatch, regarding this issue, it is rumored that Britain and the Soviet Union have concluded another secret agreement. Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov requested that the treaty include an immediate opening of a second front, but Britain refused because Britain adopted a policy of tentative postponement while expressing understanding. Also, the Soviet Union requested that the treaty clearly recognize the Soviet Union's territorial boundaries as of June 22, 1941. It is rumored that Britain has agreed and has concluded another secret agreement to supplement the inadequacies of Article 5 of the Anglo-Soviet revision in order to satisfy the Soviet demands.

Helsinki, 15th (Haitong News Agency) - The Helsinki-based "Suomenmaa" newspaper's Lisbon correspondent reports that the Anglo-Soviet treaty contains a secret clause regarding border issues. Diplomatic circles in Lisbon believe that British Foreign Secretary Eden's statement that the British government has not concluded any secret agreements with Moscow other than the published treaty refers to the fact that Britain does not have any formal obligations to the Soviet Union other than the published articles. However, the British government must have reached an understanding with the Soviet Union regarding border issues before drafting Article 5 of the treaty. This is the basis of the Anglo-Soviet treaty, so it is highly possible that the Anglo-Soviet secret agreement on this matter has been concluded. The British government is, of course, aware that the Soviet Union has not forgotten the borders before June 22, 1941. However, the British government is under moral pressure from the Polish government, and its situation is extremely difficult. However, Churchill must have made the greatest concessions to the Soviet Union after weighing the situation.

British Ambassador Sir Kerr Arrives in Soviet Capital

Moscow, 15th (Havas News Agency) - British Ambassador to the Soviet Union Sir Archibald Clark Kerr arrived here today by plane from the Soviet capital of Kuibyshev in order to exchange ratification instruments for the Anglo-Soviet Treaty with the authorities here.

France and Romania Express Concerns

Paris, 15th (Haitong News Agency) - Well-informed sources in London revealed that the Anglo-Soviet secret agreement on dividing spheres of influence in Europe after the war has attracted the attention of the French side. France is deeply concerned about Britain's request to establish bases on the Atlantic and Mediterranean coasts of France. "Paris Soir" states that given the recent attitude and policies of Britain towards France, Britain's request to establish bases on the French coast is possible. At the same time, Washington's public demands for French territories such as Madagascar, Martinique, Guiana, and Guadeloupe are not far behind.

Bucharest, Romania, 14th (Havas News Agency) - Official and press circles here have remained silent for 48 hours regarding the treaty concluded between Britain and the Soviet Union. It was not until this month that they began to comment on it, expressing doubts about the effectiveness of the treaty. According to "Universal Press," Romania's policy of strengthening national unity and ensuring national security will not be shaken by this.

Conflicting Intentions Between Britain and the United States

Lisbon, 15th (Haitong News Agency) - The New York Times states that if a comparison is made between the negotiations conducted by Roosevelt and Molotov and the negotiations conducted by British Minister of Production Lyttelton and U.S. arms production meeting chairman Nelson, it is not difficult to find a contradiction between them. Roosevelt and Molotov's negotiations agreed to open a second front in Europe this year, but the results of Lyttelton and Nelson's negotiations stated that a military production plan for launching a large-scale offensive against Germany has now been drafted, but this plan will not be completed until the spring of 1943. Based on this, how can the Allied nations open a second front in Europe this year?

Stockholm, 14th (Havas News Agency) - The "Neue Zürcher Zeitung's" Berlin correspondent recently telegraphed that German newspapers are commenting on Soviet Foreign Commissar Molotov's trip to Britain and the United States and the Anglo-Soviet alliance treaty, believing that the United States has not actually participated in the treaty, but has only signed a new military equipment lend-lease agreement with the Soviet Union. Among them, the "Deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung" pointed out the contradictions between Articles 3 and 5 of the Anglo-Soviet alliance treaty. The treaty allows the two signatory countries to establish a collective security system and take any measures to prevent Germany or its allies from re-offending or disrupting peace. If this is the case, the Soviet Union will inevitably obtain strategic borders to ensure its national security during the period from the end of the war to the establishment of final peace, disregarding collective security. In other words, the Soviet Union does not intend to abandon the Baltic coastal states and the Finnish territory occupied in the 1939-40 war.

Nehru's actions have taken a step towards the liberation of India. "The National News" stated that many ethnic groups in East Asia are still under the propaganda influence of Britain, and the attitude of Nehru and Gandhi is truly enlightening.

The meeting then adjourned, and the first day's agenda came to a close.

Bangkok, 15th Dispatch from Domei News Agency: The General Assembly of the Indian Independence League held a meeting on the 15th at the National Theatre here. The original text of the congratulatory message from Japanese Prime Minister Tojo is as follows: I deeply approve of the Indian people's efforts to build India. However, today there still exists in India the vestige of British possession, military facilities, and the empire has a firm determination, that is, to strengthen them. If British military forces remain in India, we will thoroughly defeat them. I deeply desire to save India from the scourge of war, but this requires Britain to abandon its ambitions towards India, or India must quickly sever its relationship with Britain. Fortunately, the General Assembly of the Indian Independence League has now been established, representing the true public opinion of Indians in East Asia. I vow to give full support to this movement.

The Caucasus has rich oil reserves and is a passage between Britain and the Soviet Union. "Epi Si Bao" continued, Turkey is one of the European countries and must maintain its control of the Dardanelles and pay attention to the Soviet Union's ambitions in Southeast Europe. Considering Turkey's position in Asia, the Soviet Union's expansion of power in Iran will inevitably cause uneasiness. All of these developments should enable Turkey to decide which path it should follow.

### Turkey's Economic Crisis

Ankara, Turkey, 14th Dispatch from Havas News Agency: In recent months, Turkey has encountered a serious economic crisis. The government is now trying to find solutions that do not involve diplomatic relations. Although the economic crisis in Turkey has been brewing for a long time, it has not surfaced until March of this year, when it suddenly reversed. On the one hand, it was affected by the war, resulting in a decrease in the original food imports. On the other hand, due to environmental constraints, it had to increase the export volume of its own food production as the price of maintaining Turkey's neutrality, resulting in domestic production and storage conditions in a precarious state. As a result, there is a shortage of domestic goods, prices are soaring, and the government has had to take measures to limit consumption to cope with the situation. Reducing the purchase limit of bread to half a pound per person per day is one example. Furthermore, according to statistics released by the Ministry of Commerce in January of this year, the high cost of living has reduced people's purchasing power by two-thirds, and it has continued to rise since then. By April of this year, the cost of living was 200% higher than in 1938. In this situation of soaring prices and difficulties in distributing goods, residents in some areas, especially larger cities such as Istanbul, naturally feel dissatisfied. At the same time, foreign propaganda agencies took the opportunity to exploit the situation, exacerbating the economic difficulties in Turkey and exposing them to the public.

### Pétain Returns to Vichy

Vichy, 15th Dispatch from Havas News Agency: Marshal Pétain returned here this morning from Toulouse and immediately resumed his duties as usual.

Vichy, 15th Dispatch from Haitong News Agency: French Head of State Pétain is currently inspecting the city of Toulouse. Yesterday, thousands of French people from Languedoc went to the city to welcome him, and 20,000 members of the Legion held a military review, paying their respects to him. Pétain gave a speech stating that the new French constitution will not be promulgated until peace is achieved. What is needed now is to mobilize everything to carry out the country's reconstruction work. Pétain urged people from all over to unite for the country and the nation, and to take patriotism as the highest concept. Before returning to Vichy last night, Pétain met with labor representatives and delivered a speech, saying that in order to revive France, social stability must first be achieved, so he hoped that labor-management disputes would no longer occur in the future.

### 5. Egypt: A Broad Overview

Egypt is an ancient country. Five thousand years ago, when Europe was still a desolate and sparsely populated wilderness, a brilliant culture was already being conceived and beginning in the desert that European gentlemen still refer to as "black soil" in the twentieth century. The natives, growing up on the banks of the Nile, relied on the natural geographical advantages to open their minds and lay the cultural foundations for all countries in the world. Even in today's era of brilliant civilization, people still express respect and admiration when they talk about Egypt.

The war restarted in 1939, and the flames of war spread, placing ancient Egypt, with its five thousand years of brilliant civilization, in a position of turbulence and unease. The great Sphinx stands tall in the rolling yellow sands, not knowing how many years it has endured, or how many times it has encountered the spectacle of human warfare. Today, the Sphinx sees once again its descendants, growing up on the banks of the Nile, about to become a notable character in the world of war. The Sphinx must be filled with endless sighs.

Trying to use concise words and clear descriptions to make readers understand some of Egypt's past and present is a task akin to measuring the sea with a gourd. For now, I will divide it into two parts: 1. The terrain and the situation since World War I and the current situation. 2. The great Nile River.

Terrain and Situation Since World War I

Asia and Africa are connected by Egypt's Sinai Peninsula. To the northwest is the vast Mediterranean Sea, and to the southeast, separated by the Arabian Desert, is the narrow Red Sea as a boundary. Travelers from China to Europe, taking the Mediterranean route, must pass through this Red Sea, which feels warm even in the cold winter. When the postal ship enters the calm Suez Canal, the great pyramids suddenly appear in view, letting you know that you have reached the ancient country of Egypt.

("The Discovery of Africa") After the opening of the Suez Canal, Egypt became a key point in the transportation between Europe and Asia, and its position became increasingly important. Before 1870, Europeans did not know much about the internal situation of Africa. Around 1850, Englishman David Livingstone and American journalist Stanley went to explore Africa, braving the dangers of epidemics, poisonous snakes, and fierce beasts. They went deep into barren lands, and over thirty years, they discovered the sources of the Nile, Zambezi, and Congo rivers, attracting the attention of various European countries. Stanley died of old age in Africa after his last exploration.

(The Creator of Modern Egypt) Since the 19th century, after European explorers discovered this black soil that contained abundant treasures, the European powers began to colonize Africa, each dividing up their spheres of influence. Egypt was originally a territory of the Roman Empire. In the seventh century AD, it was conquered by the Arabs. During the latter half of the Middle Ages, Egypt was occupied by a type of Islamic military force called the Mamluks. In 1517, it became territory of the Turkish Empire. After the Turkish power weakened, the Mamluks once again gained power. At the end of the 18th century, Napoleon invaded Egypt and fought against the Mamluks. Unfortunately, Napoleon's plan to conquer Egypt was thwarted by the British. After this, a hero rose from the ranks in Albania, named Muhammad Ali, who crossed the sea from Turkey to Egypt and established himself as king, forcing the Turkish emperor in 1805 to recognize him as governor. Ali became the creator of modern Egypt, carrying out various reforms, establishing armies and navies, and unifying Egypt and the Sudan in the upper reaches of the Nile.

In 1854, ten years after Ali's death, the Canal Company was established. French lawyer Lesseps raised funds from French and Egyptian investors and began to excavate the canal. Egypt's position became increasingly important. Port Said, at the northern entrance of the canal, connects to the Mediterranean Sea, and the city of Suez, at the southern entrance, connects to the Red Sea. But while the whole world gained a Suez Canal, Egypt was forgotten by the world. In 1863, Ismail became the governor of Egypt. His original intention was to use the canal to revitalize Egypt, but due to his inherent foolishness, arrogance, extravagance, and financial incompetence, the precious canal shares easily fell into the hands of the British.

(The Question of Egyptian Independence) The Egyptian people were unwilling to accept foreign interference, raised the banner of national independence, and rose up in resistance. The British used military force to suppress them, and when World War I broke out, they formally took it under protection. After the end of the war, the voices for national self-determination rose high, and Egyptian patriot Zaghlul advocated a national independence movement. Anti-British movements broke out locally, causing constant disturbances. In 1922, Britain recognized Egypt's independence, and Zaghlul, under the orders of the King of Egypt, served as Prime Minister. When Zaghlul died in 1927, the whole country mourned in unison. The national movement suddenly lost a powerful leader, and Britain's threats to Egypt increased. In the summer of 1936, the King of Egypt and Britain established an agreement, which of course did not satisfy the Egyptian people. Biographer Emil Ludwig talked about it in his authoritative work "The Nile River": "The relationship in the coming years will depend on which of the two countries, Britain and Egypt, has better politicians, and this official will have to understand how to use the future war to solve the Egyptian independence problem." The so-called "future war" is now being staged on the world stage. Britain's anxiety and difficulty with the Egyptian question are no less than the Indian question. Cripps' journey in India serves as a warning. If they continue to offer only lip service and no real benefit, trying to muddle through the difficult situation, it will probably not help to prolong the stalemate.

(Area, Population, Cities) Egypt borders Libya to the east and British-Egyptian Sudan to the south. It has an area of approximately 380,000 square miles and a population of over 14.2 million. The country has abundant agricultural production, producing wheat, cotton, sugarcane, soybeans, and tobacco. Mineral resources include oil, sulfur, gold, and silver. The capital, Cairo, is on the east bank of the Nile. The city has many Islamic mosques and many medieval buildings can still be seen. The Egyptian Museum contains ancient sculptures and paintings, becoming a valuable treasure for later scholars to study ancient Egyptian culture. Across the Nile in Giza stands the world-famous pyramids and the Sphinx. More will be said about these later. Alexandria, at the western mouth of the Nile Delta in northern Egypt, is where trade between Europe and Africa is concentrated.

### Detailed Measures for Rationing Grain Will Be Officially Announced; Rice Tickets Are Being Numbered; Grain Certificates Issued to Residents of the French Concession

Regarding the rationing of grain in the concession area, the Shanghai Municipal Council's Grain Management Committee has completed preparations and will begin implementation on the 22nd of this month. Rice tickets will be issued first, and rice will be distributed upon presentation of the tickets starting on July 1st. This work should proceed smoothly because the Baojia system in the concession area has already been completed, and the number of people in the households has been accurately verified. 657 rice shops in the two concessions have been designated to be responsible for retail sales of rice, and rice will be distributed according to the number of households in each district. Currently, the rice tickets for rationing have been printed and are being numbered. It is said that the rice tickets will be handed over to the Baojia Steering Committee for distribution to the Baojia heads in each district, who will distribute the grain according to the number of people in each household. The price of rice and the detailed measures for rationing will be officially announced by the Shanghai Municipal Council.

The French Concession Plans to Issue Rice at the Same Time

The official date for the implementation of grain rationing in the French Concession is set for July 1st. According to reporters from Datong News Agency, the Baojia offices in each district of the French Concession are currently stepping up their work. According to news from the Fulili Road Grain Management Office, the rice shops have already made wooden signs printed with the words "Registered No. [number], Shanghai French Concession Rice Retail Outlet," to ensure that the grain rationing system is realized as scheduled. Furthermore, the police have issued a notice instructing the Baojia heads to inform the heads of each household to represent their families and tenants to collect grain certificates. These grain certificates are issued once a month, and the date is determined by the police. When the heads of households go to collect them, they must bring their household registration certificates (placed in transparent bags) and the house tax receipts for the house for presentation and verification.

Household Heads Should Faithfully Distribute

After obtaining the grain certificates, the heads of each household should transfer them to each sub-household in the house, and the number of people must match what is filled in on the Baojia household registration certificate. If a new tenant moves into the house, they must register at the police station eight days before the grain certificates are issued so that a grain certificate can be prepared for this new tenant. If they do not report within this deadline, their grain certificate will be issued later next month. In addition, the household head must prepare a book to copy the grain certificates distributed to each tenant, record the date of transfer of the grain certificates, and have the tenant stamp their seal on this book for police verification. The household head must faithfully distribute the grain certificates that each tenant is entitled to. If there is any fraud, once reported, the household head will be severely punished. The police authorities also stated that any disputes between landlords and tenants are completely unrelated to these grain certificates. The household head must not use this as an excuse to coerce, and no interference with the distribution of food is allowed to occur. If the tenant is able to obtain this certificate, they can refuse to pay rent to the household head. It is also heard that they have already notified the heads of each household to write on the back of the house tax receipt the words "Listed in Bao [number], Jia [number]" and at the same time, all residents without guarantors in each Lianbao area should quickly report the names and addresses of these residents to the Baojia Committee, but they must indicate the reason why they could not find a guarantor for verification.

### Temporary Transit Passes Will Expire Soon; Return-to-Hometown Transit Passes Continue to Be Issued

The Shanghai Municipal Council's Chinese Evacuation Committee previously issued a temporary transit pass to facilitate residents' return to their hometowns and return to Shanghai. Its effective time is limited to the end of this month, and it will be invalid on July 1st. The committee hopes that the relevant organizations will inform all parties as much as possible. Those who wish to leave Shanghai at present and still return to Shanghai before the end of the month should apply for one as soon as possible. Otherwise, once the deadline has passed, no more will be issued. As for the return-to-hometown transit pass, it will continue to be issued.

### Observatory Will Devise Methods to Indicate Hurricane Paths

South Pacific hurricanes will become active starting next month, and the chances of them sweeping along the coast of China will also increase day by day. Therefore, the Observatory will begin reporting on hurricane paths starting on July 1st. However, with the war currently being waged in the Pacific, various islands in the Pacific will inevitably cease weather reporting, and the number of ships traveling to and from the South Pacific will also be greatly reduced. Therefore, during this year's hurricane season, the Observatory's work of reporting on hurricanes and the Customs' work of instructing ships to avoid them will be greatly difficult. However, the Observatory and the Customs will continue to cooperate closely to reduce possible damage. In addition, there will be high tides during the Dragon Boat Festival in the Huangpu River, with the amount of high tide at around 11 feet. The height of this year's high tide is the first time this year.

### French Concession Trams Still Accept Old Subsidiary Currency

The French Concession trams will refuse to accept old currency starting today. All old French currency above one yuan will be rejected, but old subsidiary currency notes of Chinese origin can still be used.

### From Tomorrow Onward: Strict Prohibition of Retail Price Gouging, with Prices Halved Based on Late May; Hoping Citizens Will Submit Written Reports

A public notice from the Shanghai Municipal Council's Intelligence Office states: The authorities of the Public Concession, French Concession, and the West Shanghai area jointly notify the citizens that they should pay close attention to the official notice regarding the crackdown on price gouging announced today. The aforementioned notice stipulates that from the 17th of this month, all retail prices should be calculated in new legal tender. The prices calculated in new legal tender must not exceed half the average value calculated in old legal tender from May 26th to May 28th of this year.

Reporting Procedures

If citizens encounter any instances of price gouging, they are urged to report them to the authorities for investigation and suppression. If the price-gouging shop is located in the Public Concession, reports should be made to the "Price Limit Enforcement Office" at Office No. 185, General Office of this Bureau, No. 209 Jiangxi Road. If the shop is located in the French Concession, reports should be made to the Price Control Office of the French Concession Authority, No. 2 Fuxing Middle Road. If the shop is located outside the two concessions, reports should be made to the West Shanghai Special Police Station, No. 246 Haig Road. All reports of price gouging must be submitted in writing and accompanied by evidence such as invoices, etc.

Penalties for Exceeding Limits

In accordance with the provisions of this Bureau's Notice No. 5798, those who violate, assist in violating, or intend to violate the price limit regulations may be subject to one or more of the following penalties: 　Detention or revocation of license;　Order to suspend business for a period of time;　Refusal to grant various benefits from the Bureau's Controlled Goods Office, and confiscation of goods worth the amount of the stipulated fine. The Bureau may, at its discretion, convert the above penalties into fines.

### Tram Company Engine Explosion: Worker Injured and Killed

Huang Zijia, a 55-year-old oiler for the French Tram Company machine room, a native of Yangzhou, was working at 2:00 PM the day before when an engine suddenly exploded, sending iron shards flying, injuring his chest and abdomen. His injuries were severe, and he was sent to the hospital for treatment but died the next morning at 6:00 AM.

### Rice Shops Pay Guarantee Deposits to the Bureau, Given Annual Interest of Four Percent

The Shanghai Municipal Council's Rice Management Committee has issued a notice to all rice shops, stating: Regarding the guarantee deposits paid to this Bureau by the rice shops in accordance with the recent retail contracts established with this Bureau, this Bureau has now decided to provide interest on the aforementioned guarantee deposits at an annual rate of 4%. The first interest payment date is set for September 30th of this year, and thereafter, interest will be paid quarterly.

### Shanghai Infectious Disease Hospital's Epidemic Department to Open Next Month

The Shanghai Infectious Disease Hospital on Qiaqing Road in this city, according to past practice, should have added an epidemic department from yesterday (June 16th). However, due to recent economic difficulties and soaring prices, it has been exceptionally postponed to open next month. However, the number of outpatients at the hospital has already exceeded 200, indicating a trend of prevalent summer diseases.

### Yonggu Weaving Factory's Carelessness

At 6:20 PM yesterday, the Yonggu Weaving Factory near Tokyo Road on Robison Road suddenly caught fire due to carelessness. Flames soared into the sky, making it impossible to control. It had not been extinguished by the time of this writing.

### Students' Parents Give Teachers Cash: Restoring the Fine Tradition of Respecting Teachers; Primary School Teachers' Lives Are Particularly Hard; Parents Give According to Their Means and Voluntarily

Since the soaring prices in this city have made life extremely difficult for ordinary people, teachers' lives are particularly hard. Often, after a day of hard work, they still struggle to make ends meet, but they continue to patiently guide and teach without being weary. Their spirit is truly admirable. Some students' parents, feeling that our country's traditional customs hold teachers in great respect, suggested sending teachers cash gifts for the Dragon Boat Festival as a token of respect, in order to restore the inherent virtue of respecting teachers. When giving gifts, the actual circumstances of the teacher and whether they teach diligently should be considered. On the other hand, the economic situation of the students' parents should also be taken into account. This act is purely voluntary, as a way for students' parents to show respect for teachers, and is by no means initiated by the school, so as to avoid resembling fundraising and causing malpractices. Several schools in the French Concession have already received festival gifts from students' parents.

### Huazhong Public Utility Payments: Switching to Military Scrip and Reserve Certificates; Calculated According to the Official Exchange Rate; Effective After the 20th of This Month

A report from the Allied News Agency states that the fees for transportation facilities and public utilities operated by Sino-Japanese joint venture companies have previously only been accepted in military scrip. It has now been decided that from June 20th onwards, the fees for railways, ships, gas, electricity, and tap water companies in the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces will be implemented using both military scrip and reserve certificates as units. This matter was announced yesterday in conjunction with the Huazhong Liaison Department of the East Asia Institute. When implemented, the exchange rate between military scrip and reserve certificates will be calculated according to the official rate of 18 yuan of military scrip for 100 yuan of reserve certificates. Furthermore, the fees for public utilities managed by the Japanese military within the Shanghai concessions will henceforth only be accepted in reserve certificates in principle. According to a statement released by the Huazhong Liaison Department of the East Asia Institute, after the implementation of the new currency policy in the Huazhong area and the consolidation of the old legal tender, the scope of circulation of reserve certificates will be expanded. In particular, as the authorities have previously announced an exchange rate of 18 yuan of military scrip for 100 yuan of reserve certificates, the military scrip economy and the reserve certificate economy are becoming increasingly integrated. In order to further promote this, the various agencies have jointly agreed to change the collection of fees for public utilities such as trains, ships, buses, gas, and tap water, which were previously collected solely in military scrip, to collect both military scrip and reserve certificates within the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, starting from June 20th. The conversion rate is 18 yuan of military scrip for 100 yuan of reserve certificates, so when paying these fees, either reserve certificates or military scrip can be used at the rate of 18 yuan. The list of companies changing to collect both military scrip and reserve certificates is as follows: Huazhong Railway, Huazhong Bus, Huazhong Water and Electricity, Huazhong Electricity and Communications, Shanghai Inland River Shipping, China Shipping, Greater Shanghai Gas, East Asia Marine Transportation (limited to the Yangtze River route), Huazhong Transportation (formerly Nippon Express), China Aviation (currently in discussions with the North China authorities, expected to be implemented after the 20th), Shanghai Special Municipality Ferry Co., Ltd., Huazhong Shipping Control Association.

### Rubber Overshoes: Restricted Sale

The price of overshoes has risen to 40 or 50 yuan per pair. Recently, the Great China Rubber Factory in this city has implemented four restrictions on sales to prevent large-scale hoarding by households. Citizens who wish to purchase them must bring their housing tax receipt for the current quarter in order to be sold them. The measures are excerpted as follows:　Those who want to buy overshoes or rubber boots must bring the current quarter's tax receipt as proof. If they want to buy more, they need to provide a household registration investigation as proof.　Regardless of gender or size, purchases are limited to those who will wear them themselves and cannot be purchased on behalf of others.　If there are indeed factual difficulties in the first item, there must also be other evidence sufficient to prove that it is an actual need and not for profit, so that the store can consider alternative measures.　Everything is limited to what is in stock. The above measures may be amended and changed at any time. As for proof of tax payment, it is the summer tax receipt in the Public Concession, the April tax receipt in the French Concession, and the spring tax receipt in the city area.

### Donating to Scholarship Funds: Creating Blessings for Relatives and Friends

Yesterday, we received a letter from Mr. Wang Liansheng, which stated: "I have resided in Shanghai for several years, and my return to my hometown is near. I have been thinking about the many times I have troubled my relatives and friends during these years. I recently invited them to a gathering, not daring to call it a repayment, but my relatives and friends were delighted to celebrate my humble birthday and bestowed generous gifts. I cannot express my gratitude enough. But because my birthday is not yet timely, and life has been difficult, how could I dare to disturb them again? I urgently declined their gifts and received them with shame. Therefore, I am donating to scholarship funds on their behalf, respectfully creating blessings for everyone." His enthusiasm for contributing is deeply appreciated. Yesterday, we received the following scholarship funds: Wang Liansheng (birthday gifts from relatives and friends) 167.50 reserve certificates, Zheng Donglin 15 yuan, Chen Mingxuan 15 yuan, Tian Mingxuan 15 yuan, Wang Shujiu 5 yuan, Zhan Ziqin 10 yuan, Lu Zongchan 10 yuan, Chen Meixiang 10 yuan, Shao Rong 10 yuan, Zhu Xiafa 10 yuan, Wang Wenfu 7.50 yuan, Lu Xukang, Lu Xuzhang, Lu Xuchang, 25 yuan combined, Wang Quansheng 5 yuan, Wang Guisheng 5 yuan, Wang Renguan 5 yuan, Wang Ronghuan 5 yuan, Hu Gentang 5 yuan, Chonghao (gift of 5 yuan. Previously stored reserve certificates 34,591.86 yuan. Total balance: 34,799.36 yuan.

### Japanese Military Police Expose: Anti-Japanese Tycoons of the Foreign Press (Continued from Yesterday)

Powell: Born in the United States, after graduating from the University of Missouri in 1900, he became a journalist and taught at his alma mater. In 1920, he came to Shanghai to take charge of the China Weekly Review as editor and business manager. Later, he became the editor-in-chief of the China Press. As the representative of American capitalists, he used his skills and, along with Woodhead, was a major figure in Shanghai's media. He disliked Japan, and after the September 18th Incident, he harbored anti-Japanese sentiments. Especially after the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, he believed that distorting and punishing Japan was the sole mission of the United States. Recently, he has served on the Shanghai American Intelligence Committee and other organizations in Shanghai to wage war against Japan, or published articles disrespectful to the Japanese Imperial Family, or spied on Japanese military intelligence and reported it to military attachés of certain countries. His anti-Japanese behavior is unmatched. Japanese residents in Shanghai all hate him with a vengeance, and calls for punishing Powell are overflowing the city. However, at that time, Japanese power had not yet reached the concessions, so they could only let him do as he pleased and wait for the opportunity to punish him. On December 8th, the Shanghai Military Police, with swift and decisive action, first exposed Powell and punished him.

"Activities": Powell published the following articles in the China Weekly Review on August 30, 1940: A. When commenting on the Japanese Youth Party led by Colonel Kingoro Hashimoto, he wrote disrespectful words about the Japanese Imperial Family. B. When criticizing the position of Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal Kido, he also wrote disrespectful and unstable articles. After the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War in 1937, in order to investigate Japanese military intelligence, he recruited seven people as intelligence agents: Feng, the Chinese principal of Dinghai Zhongshan Middle School in the Zhoushan Islands; Bakerly, an English pastor of the Dinghai Catholic Church; Taika, a beauty school professor; Narcissus, an American professor at Soochow University; Mills, an American professor at Nanjing University; Leachy, an American pastor in Xiamen; and Ji, a Chinese professor at Southwest Associated University in Kunming. He ordered them to secretly investigate the movement of Japanese naval vessels, the state of Japanese military operations, and the bombing of the Chinese interior by the Japanese army and the extent of the damage. He then reported this information to a certain navy major, assistant officer to the naval attaché of a certain country's embassy in China, and to a certain consul in the Japanese-related intelligence section of a certain country's consulate in Shanghai. He also summarized the communications for the China Weekly Review and the London Daily News, uncovering and leaking Japanese military secrets. After the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, Dong, a member of the Propaganda Department in Chongqing, had a student-teacher relationship with Powell when Powell was teaching at the University of Missouri. He entrusted Powell to help him with propaganda in the United States. After agreeing, Powell further distorted and criticized news reports about Japan and the National Government, repeatedly making pro-Chongqing anti-Japanese propaganda and publishing it in the China Weekly Review and other publications, hindering Japanese military operations. In 1940, because the China Weekly Review published unstable content, the Japanese side banned the distribution of the newspaper outside the concessions. In addition to bribing postal administration officials to avoid Japanese inspection, he also built a building in the Public Concession, and in the China Publishing Company in the building, the Tianjin French Concession Oriental Library, and the Xiuhe Library, he set up secret offices to privately distribute the newspaper, hindering security. Last July, he wrote to Bunahazi of the American Pacific Relations Research Association, saying that "60 Japanese cars in Shanghai have been stolen by a certain theft gang and sold to the Japanese Army Headquarters," fabricating military rumors. In addition, he drove a large number of Chinese and foreigners to collect various intelligence, organize it, or make comprehensive judgments, and report it to cadres of a certain country's embassy, and contribute anti-Japanese ideas on East Asia policy to his own government. Whenever he had the opportunity, he tried his best to create anti-Japanese public opinion.

Obert "Experience": Born in New York State, USA, after graduating from high school, he joined a New York newspaper as an apprentice. In 1934, the newspaper considered him a promising talent and appointed him as a reporter for a certain newspaper in Washington. When the Sino-Japanese War broke out, because he was quite interested in Far Eastern affairs, he went to Japan in 1938 and joined the Domei News Agency to study the situation in Japan. In 1939, he came to Shanghai via Manchuria and North China and joined the Associated Press. Later, he was dispatched to Manchuria. When the Nomonhan Incident occurred, he served as a war correspondent, reporting on the war situation in Shanghai and Tokyo. In 1940, he joined the China Press, specializing in editorials and collecting various information, responsible for wireless broadcasting matters. Since he came to Japan, he has been investigating the political trends of Japan in Shanghai and other places and the movements of the Japanese army and navy. He mistakenly believed that Japanese politics were controlled by the military and a group of right-wingers, and that it was an aggressive country. Therefore, he developed anti-Japanese ideas and wrote articles to promote the anti-Japanese movement. He and certain land and sea military officers were friends. He provided the collected information on Japan to these military officers.

"Activities": Obert is an extremely anti-Japanese figure. He often wrote articles attacking Japan, making international public opinion of Japan worse, and attacking the Japanese military, attempting to create anti-military public opinion in Japan and cause domestic unrest. Based on the information he collected while staying in Tokyo, in June 1940, he published an article in the China Press titled "The Inside Story of the Japanese Political World," fabricating rumors, saying that the Japanese political world was recently quite chaotic, that the German-Italian alliance faction and the pro-British and American faction were fighting each other over a certain matter, and that Prime Minister Yonai was in a difficult situation. He also wrote articles with titles such as "Today's Countermeasures," "Satisfactory Plans," "The Munich Conference of the Pacific," and "Meaningful Pictures," ridiculing Japan and the Japanese army. Last September, he corresponded with Gould, the former editor of the China Press, who resided in New York, and reported based on the collected information that A. The Japanese government and people do not want to engage in conflict with the United States and the Soviet Union, but ×× expresses opposition. If Japanese-American negotiations are successful, ×× will occur in Japan. B. The Hiranuma assassination attempt was actually a rumor from the opposition to ××. The Japanese army dispatched the minimum number of troops to ××, and there was a risk of action occurring in ××. C. Japan is preparing to invade, dispatching troops from North China and Central China to ×× with ×× troops, and to ×× in Central China with ×× troops. Currently, there are ×× to ×××× troops stationed there. The current situation in Japan is similar to when the Manchurian Incident occurred in 1922. Last December, he wrote to Glatki, the manager of the Boston newspaper in the United States, based on news heard from a certain Major, a military officer of a certain country's army, relaying that the war would break out before this winter, and that the Japanese ×××× project at ××× has been suspended, but the Japanese side believes that this is due to obstruction by ××. Also, the hardliners in Japan advocate that the ×× authorities estimate ××× and ×××. Around November of the same year, he sent anti-Japanese broadcasting materials to Mossfath, the director of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, titled "Foreign Minister Matsuoka's Trip to Europe," falsely claiming that deep opposition had occurred in Japan, and wrote articles such as anti-military articles. In addition, he repeatedly met secretly with a certain military officer of a certain country's embassy and a certain major, an intelligence officer of a certain country's Marine Corps, to collect various information about Japan, and discuss the situation in Japan and the deployment of Japanese troops in Manchuria, China. In addition to acting as a spy for a certain country, he also made false propaganda and fabricated rumors about military affairs.

Woodhead "Experience": Born in Boulder, Taiwan, after graduating from the Purai Dong High School, he worked as a private teacher for seven years, studying literature. In December 1913, he was dispatched by the North-China Daily News as a special correspondent to China, and was quite active in North China. Later, he hosted the publication of the magazine "Far Eastern Review" in Shanghai, and was a special contributor to the China Press. In addition, he wrote for various newspapers and magazines in Shanghai, and had potential influence in the Chinese media, like Tokutomi Sohō in the Japanese media. After the September 18th Incident, witnessing the rapid development of Japan, his feelings towards Japan gradually deteriorated. He mistakenly believed that Japan was an imperialist aggressive country controlled by the military. Later, he was instructed by a certain agency in London to guide foreign public opinion in China. At that time, his articles on Japan-related matters were all the rage in Shanghai. In February last year, Woodhead and more than a dozen others were appointed as members of the Intelligence Department Committee of a certain country's embassy in Shanghai to plan the UK's propaganda efforts at home and abroad. From September of the same year, under the order of the chairman of the committee, the head of the embassy's intelligence department, he received a reward of 700 yuan per month and broadcast anti-Japanese propaganda twice a week, and published the full text in the "Far Eastern Review" he ran, striving to create anti-Japanese and anti-Japanese public opinion among foreigners and Chinese people. In addition, he supplied the information collected to the heads of a certain country's embassy in China. "Activities": Under the order of the head of the Intelligence Department of a certain country's embassy, Woodhead spread rumors on the "XMHC" radio station: A. He criticized Japan's constitution as an imitation of Germany's bureaucratic dictatorship political mechanism. B. Japan's politics are controlled by the army and navy. If the military does not agree, the cabinet cannot be established, and he falsely claimed that the military does not recognize the authority, etc., insulting the dignity of the Japanese Emperor. (2) On September 22 last year, with the title "The So-Called Order," he broadcast on the radio and published articles in newspapers and magazines related to him, attempting to create anti-Japanese public opinion. (3) In 1940, Gauss, a Tokyo correspondent for Reuters, committed suicide by jumping from the investigation room of the Tokyo Military Police. Woodhead immediately distorted this matter as being due to the harsh treatment of the Japanese military police. In October of the same year, he published an article in the Far Eastern Review and the China Press titled "The Methods of the Japanese Secret Police," doing his utmost to slander the Japanese military police. (2) Last September, he published an article in the Far Eastern Review titled "Japan's Navy," which stated that "Japan does not comply with the 35,000-ton limit stipulated by the Washington Treaty and is building × ships exceeding that number," and that "the largest Japanese battleships before this war were Nagato and Mutsu, with a tonnage of ××× tons, equipped with ×× cannons × doors, and a speed of ×× knots," greatly criticizing Japan for building warships exceeding the limit and leaking the performance of Japanese warships. (4) In addition, he used figures in the newspaper and magazine industry to collect various information about Japan from all aspects, judged it based on his rich knowledge of East Asia, reported it to his government, and supplied it to the heads of a certain country's embassy. A certain country's embassy attached great importance to Woodhead in anti-Japanese propaganda and espionage.

### Shanghai Chinese Child Welfare Association Established: A Glimpse of the Child Welfare Training Institute; Housing 120 Boys and Girls; Meat Only Once a Month, Insufficient Nutrition

The Shanghai Child Welfare Training Institute at 1231 Lafayette Road was established by the Chinese Child Welfare Association. The institute was founded in March 1930. Its original location was on Tangshan Road in the Public Concession. In that year, droughts occurred in the provinces of Zhili, Shandong, and Henan, and the institute took in refugee children from the north. However, the number was only a little over ten. As the number increased year by year, it moved to the French Concession. The number of refugees housed reached 80, and there were also 40 freed maids, totaling 120. The ages of the boys range from six to eleven years old, and the ages of the girls range from six to sixteen years old. Most of them are from the provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, and there are also many from Guangdong. Most of them are boys and girls who have suffered from water, fire, or war disasters, or are lost or wandering, or have been abducted or abused. They are indeed orphans and have no one to rely on. They are introduced by others or sent to the institute by relief organizations for shelter and education.

The institute currently has three buildings, divided into four classrooms, eight bedrooms, one sickroom, one dining hall, and one kitchen. In addition, there are offices and staff dormitories. The furnishings are very neat and tidy. There are a total of seven staff members, including one director, three class teachers, one general affairs officer兼accountant, one nurse, and one caretaker兼physical education teacher. Most of them are graduates of normal schools and have rich educational experience. When reporters visited, the students were in class. The teachers were patient and encouraging, and their spirits were very high. In addition, some male students were washing rice and cutting vegetables, boiling water and cooking, preparing lunch. There was also a female student who was grinding tofu milk for refreshments. According to Director Yao of the institute, the students personally handle daily cooking, laundry, tidying up the house, organizing bedding, and washing utensils. The two female servants hired are responsible for sewing and mending clothes and helping with cooking. If students cannot take care of their studies due to rotation work, they will be given supplementary lessons during evening self-study so that both can be taken care of.

In terms of diet, there are three meals a day, but recently, due to the lack of rice, only porridge is eaten, mixed with pearl rice. About seven斗 of rice are needed every day. Soymilk is drunk twice, at 10:00 AM and 4:00 PM. The cost of dishes is about 40 yuan per day. Meat dishes such as meat and pork liver were originally once a week, but now, due to high prices, they have been changed to once a month. Only young children can eat more eggs to maintain nutrition. If children fall ill, those with mild illnesses are moved to the sickroom for treatment in the institute. Doctors come to the institute to diagnose and treat them. Those with severe illnesses are sent to the hospital for treatment, which is more thorough.

After a certain period of education and training in the institute, the boys and girls are either adopted by families as adopted children, or sent to factories and shops to learn a trade, or sent back to their hometowns, or provided with free schooling, or married after reaching the legal age, so that their lives are on the right track, and the work they do is beneficial to society and the country. Currently, because the funds of the Chinese Child Welfare Association are not very abundant, there are many aspects of the institute's facilities that need to be improved. It is hoped that the public will provide support so that these one hundred poor children can still receive good education and training in a difficult living environment.

Yesterday's newspaper was published at 6:10 PM.

### Public Bond Resale Plummets

The public bond gray market saw a sudden surge of long positions yesterday, causing prices to continue their sharp decline. Hu Heji sold aggressively, while Tongli still bought. The trend has entered a chaotic state. When prices seemed high, people rushed to buy; when they appeared low, long positions were released, and rumors spread. Buyers didn't mind high prices, and sellers didn't mind low prices – a typical speculative tactic. Long positions using collateral are easily shaken, and this group largely creates price volatility. Hu Heji's sales were initially absorbed by Lianyi and Tongli, stabilizing prices. However, as Hu Heji continued to sell aggressively, Yichang, Tongyuan, Renchang, Shuntai, and Hongxing also rushed to sell. Yongchang, Wuhe, Runde, Lianhe, Runli, Zhenhua, Chengkang, and Tongshun all bought. Prices fell sharply from high to low, ultimately dropping by one yuan and five jiao to three yuan across the board. The transaction volume was approximately two million five or six hundred thousand yuan. A simplified table is provided below:

Category | Highest | Lowest | Closing | Change from Previous Day
------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | --------
Unified A | 41.50 | 40.00 | 40.00 | Down 2.4
Unified B | 00.00 | 27.00 | 37.00 | Down 2.0
Unified C | 40.00 | 26.50 | 37.00 | Down 3.00
Unified D | 39.00 | 26.50 | 36.60 | Down 1.50
Unified E | 39.00 | 37.30 | 37.30 | Down 0.130

### ### The Head is Innocent

— Jin Yi

In the Shanghai dance hall murder case, Xue Linlin suddenly "changed her testimony in court, denying the crime," and Lin Jiaoqing and others also gave vague testimonies, favoring the accused. The police are taking this case very seriously and are conducting a thorough investigation. However, regardless of whether it's Xue Linlin, or some random person, the fact remains that Chen Yunlai's head was fractured by an iron ruler, leading to his death. Dance halls are places for "enjoyment," and Chen Yunlai went to the Shanghai dance hall, naturally, for "enjoyment." Dance halls rely on this focus to attract pleasure-seekers, and the arrangement is typically a transaction where everyone departs without incident. Even if conflicts arise, such as disputes over dance partners, the aim of mutual enjoyment should lead to resolving major issues into minor ones, and minor issues into nothing. However, in this case, a head was fractured.

Simultaneously, Ren, a comedian, had his head injured with a wooden stool by Bao, the director of the troupe, who gathered a crowd, because Ren wanted to perform temporarily in another city (commonly known as "moonlighting") due to his low salary, but Bao refused him leave, considering Ren a key member of the troupe. This is about "making a living," which is of course different from "enjoyment," but the underlying "principle" is the same. For example, if Ren is a key member of the troupe, he is Bao's right-hand man. Not to mention grand principles like "sharing hardships," even mutual exploitation should warrant better treatment. The talk of "moonlighting" implies a desire for a raise. Unexpectedly, his head was also innocent, and he was injured by a wooden stool!

Casually thinking about the connection between these two heads, I can't help but clasp my hands in reverence.

### ### Bicycle

— Li Shihua

I sold my bicycle. I bought it two years ago for only thirty yuan. With repairs, parts, and two years of license fees, it still didn't reach one hundred yuan, but I sold it for four hundred yuan. Overjoyed, I decided to take Ying to see a newsreel.

On the way, I looked at the faces of people riding bicycles and found that most of them looked dull. Well, you wouldn't ride a bicycle if you weren't a bit dull. If it's supposed to be exercise, why not walk? If it's supposed to be economical, it's not as good as taking the tram. If it's supposed to be comfortable, there's this ridiculously small, forward-sloping seat. If it's supposed to be convenient, that's not guaranteed either. When you reach your destination, you have to find a "safe place" for it. Sometimes that's easy, but sometimes it's quite a headache. If you're visiting a friend who lives upstairs, it's best to take it with you. If that's impossible, you should at least steel yourself: "If it gets stolen, so be it, less trouble." Otherwise, you might go crazy upstairs.

Oh! Ying was learning to ride a bicycle in the alley. There's probably nothing funnier than learning to ride a bicycle. All your strength is concentrated in your waist. When the bike leans to the left, your waist twists desperately to the right, but the bike leans even further to the left…

She didn't see me because her back was to me. I didn't shout to startle her either, because she was in a precarious situation. But there are always clumsy people around. A wobbly fat man was coming towards her. Logically, no matter how fat the man was, this wide alley was still more than enough space. But the person on the bicycle panicked. The bike leaned even more dangerously, the waist twisted even more desperately, and the neck shrank so much it disappeared. In the end, instead of using the three-quarters of the alley that was clear, she deliberately crashed into the quarter occupied by the fat man…

Her bike was very beautiful, streamlined, with red bars, cream-colored fenders, and shiny chrome handlebars and wheels… I asked her how much it cost.

"Two thousand yuan."

I strongly disagreed. I could find over a hundred reasons why she didn't need to spend that much. But then I thought, she's not stupid. She's a female student; is there anything that requires more brainpower than analytical geometry? Besides, she didn't say it was too cheap either. She just said:

"That's ridiculously expensive, you could have bought a small Austin for four hundred yuan before!"

"An Austin needs a chauffeur to take care of it." I had to persuade her.

"No, I'll drive it myself. Driving a car can't be harder than riding a bicycle. Riding a bicycle, well, flying a plane is probably just as awkward."

She understood even better than I did. Only one question remained: why buy it? But I didn't ask her. I was still afraid she'd ask about my bike. She spent a thousand yuan to buy a bicycle, and I sold mine for four hundred yuan. Either she's stupid, or I'm stupid. I have many reasons, but she probably has some reasons for spending so much money, although those reasons aren't necessarily the truth, but they're good enough as reasons. Why make it a confrontation?

She suddenly remembered the bicycle she was holding, sighed, and reluctantly got on.

I had to sigh with her.

### ### The Frenzy of Redeeming Pawned Items

— Xin Meng

Due to the currency system's changes, the pawnshop industry has been behaving strangely in recent days. Some have signs posted that say "Redemption Only, No New Pledges," while others write "Business as Usual." The former refers to only allowing redemptions before the 20th, without accepting new pledges; the latter still encourages redemptions but continues to accept new items, only with Central Reserve Certificates (CRC). There are even large announcements urging people to redeem their items. From the 6th to the 15th, it will be possible to redeem with old Legal Tender, or to pay interest and convert to CRC. Otherwise, if the items are not redeemed or interest paid by the 20th, the items will be redeemed at the CRC exchange rate.

The news spread, worrying poor people. Some thought that after the 20th, old Legal Tender items pawned previously would have to be redeemed with the same amount of CRC, causing panic and accusations of greedy pawnshops. Pawnshops, on the other hand, also have reasons to complain. In these times, every industry is earning money, but the pawnshop industry is suffering from the depreciation of currency and rising prices, which erode the value of their capital. The interest they collect doesn't compensate for this loss. If some pawned items are never redeemed, they won't lose money because they can be sold at high prices. However, due to rising prices, most pawned items are being redeemed. Moreover, some people are buying pawn tickets and redeeming items for customers, which is a major reason why there are so few "unredeemed items."

Currently, the pawnshop industry has agreed on regulations for redemptions and interest payments during the transition period. For items pawned before May 19th, during the 77 CRC exchange rate period, customers can redeem them with old Legal Tender between June 6th and June 15th. If they can't afford to redeem, they can pay interest and convert to CRC. If they don't redeem by the deadline, the items will be redeemed at the then-current exchange rate, using CRC. As for new pledges, the regulations haven't been agreed upon yet. The main issue is the exchange rate for items not redeemed within the period. Pawnshops want to calculate it at 77, while the authorities limit it to 2. Therefore, new pledges are temporarily suspended.

Pawnshops are ultimately capitalists, so the poor naturally suffer more. They pawn items because they don't have money, but they don't want their items to expire. This news has them in a panic. According to a pawnshop friend, the daily interest revenue has been over several thousand yuan. In a few days, even more people will probably be redeeming, perhaps forming lines like those at rice mills. If that's the case, in addition to the new term "milling," we can add "milling to redeem pawned items."

### ### A Problem Urgently Needing Resolution

— Shao Shi

Since the Concession authorities strictly enforced the licensing of subdivided housing and stipulated that sub-landlords' legal profits should be limited to 20%, sub-tenants have been celebrating. Recently, rent, electricity, and water costs have all increased and must be paid in CRC, calculated at the 3-130 exchange rate. While sub-tenants have incurred additional burdens, they are sharing the burden reasonably for the public good, so it doesn't pose a major problem. However, the imminent full implementation of CRC throughout the city means that rent payments will naturally change from old Legal Tender to CRC. Although the authorities have stipulated an exchange rate of 2-to-1 for new and old Legal Tender, many landlords are notifying sub-landlords that they must collect the original rent amount in CRC. Some sub-landlords are collectively plotting to oppose this and negotiate for payments at the legal exchange rate, but many others have already decided that they will pay the original rent amount in CRC and then collect the original rent amount in CRC from their sub-tenants. This not only spends other people's money but also takes the opportunity to collect more, even doubling the legal profit of 20%. Therefore, this issue is not just between landlords and sub-landlords. The authorities have already announced detailed regulations for sub-landlords and sub-tenants and established rent dispute mediation committees. For landlords who are changing from old Legal Tender to CRC, will they adhere to the 2-to-1 exchange rate, such as changing a former monthly rent of 50 yuan in old Legal Tender to what amount in CRC? How should water costs, previously provided by landlords, be calculated? Renters urgently hope that this issue will be resolved as soon as possible to avoid arbitrary overcharging and underpaying, which could lead to disputes.

### ### Sharing the Same Boat Through Storms

— He Jia Zhi

(6) A Snap of the Fingers

It could be said that it rained in the evening, but it could also be said that it didn't. Because the raindrops were so fine, like hairs. On the faces of coarse men like Xu Quanfu and He Zixing, the hairs on their faces were finer than the raindrops, and they simply didn't feel it. Wei Cheng had already returned and was sitting in Shuangmei Study. Upon hearing the news, Second Mistress Ye hurried out and asked, "Wei Cheng, where did you go? I woke up from a nap and had Xi Que search everywhere for you but couldn't find you. Later, He Zixing and the others came back for refreshments and said you had gone east. They are all fools and didn't even ask where you were going." Wei Cheng smiled and said, "I went to Huagang. I didn't intend to go there, I just walked around and ended up at Huagang." Second Mistress Ye said, "If you want to go out in the future, you must tell the family so they can be at ease. I used to be very at ease when you went to Shanghai and Suzhou, traveling such long distances. But now that your mother is gone, the weight of a thousand pounds is on my shoulders alone, and my courage is as small as it can be. I would rather be scolded by others than have you suffer any grievances. Last time, because that Fei Changhe came to extort money from you, I said something wrong to you. That night, I regretted it terribly. I told He Jie, and Mother He knows. Today, you went to Huagang, did you see anyone? Many merchants sent gifts on the day of your mother's funeral, you should thank them."

Wei Cheng said, "I didn't go to the main street. I only saw Zhang Shurong at the dock. Zhang Shurong is also a muddlehead." Second Mistress Ye said, "He's an experienced man, how could he be a muddlehead?" Wei Cheng said, "According to him, he saw Fei Changhe and Qin Runzhi halfway when he took Guogi, Guofang, and Sister Cuizhen to Shanghai. Sister Banzhen even greeted Fei Changhe from the boat window. So, Fei Changhe clearly knew that Sister Cuizhen was going to Shanghai. Knowing that, he deliberately came to ask me for her the next day. I said Zhang Shurong was a muddlehead because he was muddled on this point. After the boat returned to Huagang, he didn't even report it to me." Second Mistress Ye said, "Even if he reported it to you, it would be too late, the money had already been extorted, what's the use?" Wei Cheng said, "He has other muddled things too." (103)

### ### Anecdotal Records

— Cao Weijing

The fortune-telling stall at the Xx Road Post Office, in addition to selling glue, has recently added another business venture:

"Bicycle Parking, Stored Coin 1 jiao 5."

### ### Aspiration

— Yuan Ying

All human desires arise from dissatisfaction.

Do not blame heaven and others, attributing misfortune to others or the environment, thereby venting your dissatisfaction; instead, let dissatisfaction inspire you to adopt a broad view of life.

Aspiration is not a secret talent. You should constantly train yourself to imagine various future developments, thereby developing your aspirations.

Do not be just a vague dreamer; you must know how to advance practically, from your current position towards the position you want to reach.

Aspiration should motivate you to do your current work well. You must solve the problems at hand in order to move forward towards your aspirations.

Use aspiration as a guide to determine various issues during the process.

Do not always think about the satisfaction of reaching your goal. The success of one aspiration should inspire you to pursue a second aspiration.

### ### Catch Up

— Zhi Lou

In this "autumn of priced heads," I was delighted to see the news about the economy barbershop in this publication. So, I wore my long hair and happily went there. But:

The Insurance Association Barbershop in the Thames Building has posted a notice saying that prices will increase from June 1st. When I asked about long-term tickets, they said: "We don't sell them now!"

The China United Recreation Club Barbershop also has a notice about price increases from June 1st:

"Long Style 2 yuan 4 jiao (blow-drying extra 4 jiao)

Short Style 2 yuan

Children and Shaving 1 yuan 8 jiao

Non-members add 5 jiao"

I record this urgently to inform fellow comrades with long hair. And I use this to correct the previous small news.

### ### Laziness

Laziness is the nest of a hundred vices.

The path of the lazy man is full of thorns. — German Proverb

Laziness is the mother of hunger, the sister of theft. — Dutch Proverb

Laziness is the greatest luxury in the world. — English Proverb

The lazy man's business is like a thief's execution ground. — English Proverb

Difficulty arises from laziness, and suffering comes from seeking ease. — Franklin

The lazy, even when breathing, are equal to the dead. — Cicero

### ### Looking at Three Stores Leads to Great Loss

— Zhi Lou

There used to be a saying: "Looking at three stores doesn't lead to loss." Because if you compare prices and goods more, you won't be cheated when buying things.

But now it's different. Prices are "rising daily and increasing nightly." A few days ago, I wanted to buy a shirt, and the price was over fifty yuan, which I thought was expensive. I went to another store, and the same brand cost over sixty yuan. Who wouldn't choose to buy the cheaper one? But when I went back to the first store, the price had changed to 40 yuan in CRC.

Isn't this a case of "looking at three stores leads to a great loss?"
