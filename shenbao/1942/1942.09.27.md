### Japanese Naval Aircraft's War Gains in Equatorial Waters: American Flying Fortress Bombed and Falls

Allied Press Telegram from a Certain Japanese Air Force Base, 25th

It has been learned today that a Japanese Navy patrol bomber recently encountered an American Flying Fortress aircraft in a prolonged chase. The American aircraft caught fire and crashed. This type of encounter is the first of its kind since the start of the war. The incident occurred on September 9th when a Japanese aircraft was patrolling in equatorial waters and spotted a Boeing B-17 American Flying Fortress. It immediately engaged. The American aircraft, seeing that the Japanese aircraft was a seaplane, quickly responded. However, the American aircraft was no match. As neither aircraft was a fighter plane, they did not perform aerobatic maneuvers, but each chose a position and fired at the other from a distance. The American aircraft eventually had several key points accurately hit by Japanese gunfire, causing it to catch fire and fall. The chase thus came to an end. The Japanese aircraft returned to its original defense. The aircraft body was full of bullet holes, showing the intensity of the battle.

Allied Press Telegram from Tokyo, 26th

The Third Central Cooperation Conference of Japan was held at the Greater East Asia Hall here this morning at 9:00 AM. All 220 cooperation conference members, selected from the people of the entire country, attended on time. The Chairman of the Cooperation Conference and Vice President of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association, Mr. Kiichiro Ando, presided over the meeting. From the government side, Prime Minister Tojo, who also serves as the President of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association, and cabinet ministers attended. From the Imperial Rule Assistance Association side, Secretary-General Goto and heads of various bureaus attended, as well as heads of other related organizations. At 9:00 AM, the conference was declared open. The members first paid their respects to the Imperial Palace and sang the national anthem, and then held a national ceremony. Following this, Prime Minister Tojo read the Imperial Rescript on the Declaration of War. Then the general meeting was held. Prime Minister Tojo first gave a speech, expressing his determination to complete the Greater East Asia War. Following this, Cooperation Conference Chairman Ando forcefully spoke about the mission of the movement, saying that the Assistance Movement must be a genuine movement arising from the hearts of the people, and hoping that the attending members would enthusiastically cooperate. After Mr. Ando's speech, the government ministers successively spoke, expressing the resolve of the military, officials, and people to unite and cooperate with unwavering faith to advance towards the completion of the war objectives, as well as the government's determination to uphold its beliefs. At 11:00 AM, the conference members successively explained the proposed motions.

### Summary of Prime Minister Tojo's Speech

Allied Press Telegram from Tokyo, 26th

Prime Minister Tojo, concurrently President [of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association], addressed the Central Cooperation Conference, saying in essence: At the beginning of the war, the Empire was on a winning streak, and the people throughout the country were united in their efforts, so that the wartime system in all aspects of the country had made great progress. The Empire's strategic and political strategies had also been established in the shortest possible time in the most advantageous position, and all preparations had been made to cope with the future war. The Empire has achieved remarkable results since the beginning of this war. The belief that the final victory will belong to us is absolutely firm. From now on, we must ensure this final victory with the people as a whole, united in mind and cooperation. Past wars have always been wars of will against will, strong and enduring wars. In this modern war of total strength, this is even more obvious. The Greater East Asia War is a war in which all countries are gambling their survival, so we must persevere until the last five minutes to achieve a glorious victory. The uprising and perseverance of the 100 million people of the Empire are necessary, and this has already achieved considerable results today. When the Central Cooperation Conference was held last December 8, the national people were inspired by the Imperial Rescript on the Declaration of War. In October, the Central Cooperation Conference is convened again. I deeply believe that today's 100 million people have a new understanding and a deeper reflection, and in the future they will devote all their efforts and concentrate all their wisdom and ability on the war goals. Under this major situation, the government deeply feels that it is necessary to unite the country and communicate the sentiments of the people, so it is seeking concrete countermeasures. The establishment of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association is for this purpose. The main goal of convening this Central Cooperation Conference is also this. Although the conference period is only four days, I hope that everyone will use their insights to conduct concrete discussions for the certain victory of the war, the certain success of construction, and the strengthening of domestic unity, to convey the true feelings of the people under wartime, so that this conference held under the Greater East Asia War has true value.

### New Foreign Minister Tani Clarifies the War Situation

Allied Press Telegram from Tokyo, 26th

Foreign Minister Tani gave his first speech in public at the Third Central Cooperation Conference of Japan, explaining the current international situation in detail and clarifying the fundamental points of Japan's diplomacy at this stage. The main points of his speech were: More than nine months have passed since the outbreak of the war, and the enemy has been defeated by the military power. This is truly gratifying. The progress of the war has been unfolding in a favorable manner. From this, it can be seen that Britain and the United States are quite anxious after repeated defeats. No matter how they promote long-term operations, this year is actually a major period for determining the general trend of the war. If Japan's construction in Greater East Asia, especially in the South, is successful, Britain and the United States will be unable to do anything, so they have the tendency to gradually and actively guide the war. Although their situation, such as the shortage of ships, is very difficult, it is also necessary to pay attention to it.

### Three Japanese Special Envoys to Leave China and Return to Japan Soon

Allied Press Telegram from Nanjing, 26th

Japanese special envoys Hiranuma, Arita, and Nagai said when they met with Japanese and Chinese newspaper reporters today that they would soon leave Nanjing and return to Japan. They were quite satisfied with what they saw during their visit to Nanjing. The National Government is overcoming all difficulties to complete its ideals. The two countries, Japan and China, must stand side by side, share joys and sorrows, and build the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. This has been repeatedly explained, so they believe that in order to realize this ideal, China and Japan must step up cooperation, recognize the existing difficulties, and adopt appropriate future measures.

Allied Press Telegram from Nanjing, 26th

The three special envoys, Hiranuma, Arita, and Nagai, recently visited Chairman Wang at his official residence. The two sides held a second informal talk. Foreign Minister Chu, Ambassador Shigemitsu, and Minister Hidaka also attended. It is reported that the theme of the talks was the concrete methods for continued cooperation between the two countries in the current war.

### Hiranuma Broadcast

Allied Press Telegram from Nanjing, 26th

Hiranuma, the Japanese special envoy currently visiting Nanjing, delivered a radio address to the Chinese people last night, saying that Japan is willing to give the National Government all possible assistance, and hopes that the 400 million people of China will understand Japan's true intentions and cooperate with Chairman Wang and other leaders to achieve the goal of peace as quickly as possible. The Chinese people must renew their determination to become the nuclear country of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere with Japan and Manchukuo. When the National Government returns to Nanjing in the 29th year of the Republic of China, Japan will celebrate the 2,600th anniversary of the founding of the Japanese Empire based on the spirit of Hakkō ichiu. The new order in East Asia is based on the fundamental principles of complete justice, as can be seen in the conclusion of the Sino-Japanese Basic Treaty and the Sino-Japanese-Manchu Joint Declaration. From a practical point of view, these three countries should cooperate most closely in politics, economics, military affairs, and culture to advance towards common goals. The fate of Greater East Asia and the people of East Asia depends entirely on the outcome of the current war, so all ethnic groups in East Asia must unite into a close unit, overcome all possible difficulties with an iron will, and move forward to fully achieve their common goals. It is a cause for celebration that Japan, China, and Manchukuo sincerely guarantee cooperation and joint action to achieve the goals of the current war.

### Special Envoy Nagai's Speech

Special Envoy Nagai of Japan delivered a public speech yesterday entitled "To the Citizens of the Republic of China." The translated manuscript was about 4,000 to 5,000 words long. Due to space limitations, it could not be fully published. The main points are excerpted below:

The speech first stated that as the opportunity for the rise of Asia spreads across the continent, a major turning point will be seen in world history. We have been commissioned to go to the Republic of China to convey the respect and trust of the Japanese government and people to the citizens of the Republic of China, who share the important mission of rebuilding Asia with the Japanese people. We feel honored and happy to have the opportunity to contribute to strengthening cooperation between China and Japan. Next, he expressed his admiration for Chairman Wang of the National Government, and then described the invasion of Britain and the United States, saying that since 1498, when Vasco da Gama of Portugal circumnavigated the Cape of Good Hope and arrived in India, the history of Europe and Asia for the past four centuries has been largely the history of invaders and the invaded. Asia has an area of 17 million square kilometers, not only the largest continent in the world, but also a major resource base. Therefore, European and American countries have devoted their efforts to invading Asia and monopolizing its resources. Their great competition has resulted in their dominance. The Republic of China was also subjected to the establishment of concessions, administrative rights, customs administrative rights, consular jurisdiction, etc. by Britain after the Treaty of Nanjing in 1842, and foreign countries also benefited from this, so China's sovereignty was obviously infringed. August 29 was the centennial anniversary of the Opium War and the Treaty of Nanjing. At that time, Governor-General Lin Zexu of Guangdong and Guangxi stated in his memorial that Britain knew the terrible harm of opium, but still transported opium, which was banned in Britain, to China, disregarding the harm to human life and only greedy for huge profits. Therefore, it forced the import, which is against the principles of nature. Moreover, it took advantage of the victory to divide China's territory, forced the signing of unequal treaties, demanded the opening of five ports, continued the import of opium, and forcibly seized undue compensation. This is a violent act of trampling on justice and humanity. Even if we are not Chinese, we should rise up and overthrow Britain. Britain forced China to use the privileges based on the conclusion of unequal treaties to establish bases in key areas of China, and gradually expand its sphere of influence in the interior of China. When it saw the rise of the spirit of Asian independence between China and Japan, Britain and its ally, the United States, did their best to alienate China and Japan. The United States' ambition to dominate Asia is no less than that of Britain. The United States once conquered Mexico, expanded its territory on the Pacific coast, merged Hawaii into the United States during the Hawaiian Revolution, divided the Samoa Islands, occupied Midway Island, and started a war with Spain for no reason, plundering the Philippines and Guam. This move was out of the United States' attempt to invade the Asian continent and secure a base. After the United States obtained these bases, in 1899, it forced China to respect the principle of open doors and equal opportunities for the United States. Do you think the United States respects the principle of open doors and equal opportunities for China? In 1880, the US government forced the Chinese government to recognize the ban on Chinese immigrants entering the country within ten years. Then, in 1886, the US Congress passed the so-called Scott Act, resolving to absolutely prohibit Chinese laborers from entering the country. In 1902, it also formulated laws that not only apply to the mainland of the United States, but also to territories such as Hawaii and the Philippines, forever banning Chinese immigrants from entering the country. The United States excludes Asians in this way, implements its closed-door policy on Asian immigrants, and still demands open doors and equal opportunities from China and Japan. This is extremely contradictory. If the United States has the right to demand open doors and equal opportunities from China and Japan, then China and Japan naturally have the right to demand open doors and equal opportunities for the US mainland. Moreover, if Americans have the right to block their doors and refuse to develop their resources for Asians, we Asians can also block our doors and develop Asian resources for the sake of Asians themselves. This is a natural right to survive. The United States' closure of its doors to Asians, strict prohibition of entry, Asia must be developed by Americans, the United States does not recognize the naturalization rights of Asians, Asia must recognize the naturalization rights of Americans, in fact, is equivalent to admitting American invasion of Asia, exploitation is not allowed by international justice. British Prime Minister Churchill and US President Roosevelt issued a joint declaration after meeting on the Atlantic Ocean last August, stating that the UK and the US respect the right of the people of all countries deprived of government and sovereignty to form governments according to their own opinions and to restore sovereignty and independence. The UK and the US, which have invaded small and weak countries around the world and violently trampled on the independent movements of small and weak nations, claim to respect and restore the sovereignty and independence of small and weak nations, which is self-deception. The UK and the US, seeing that they cannot maintain their vested interests in China, declared that they will abolish their extraterritorial rights and return concessions in the near future to appease the Chinese people. This kind of promise is only a temporary deception and cannot be believed, as Mr. Sun Yat-sen pointed out. The attitude of the UK and the US after World War I can make this clear. Ladies and gentlemen, all mankind is currently facing unprecedented turmoil. It is hoped that a great idea will emerge beyond this great turmoil to re-guide people's hearts and rebuild the world. The UK and the US advocate democracy and promote rebuilding the world with democracy, but the democracy of the UK and the US is in fact nothing more than the money power of a few financial groups who bear party fees and election expenses. The demand of these few financial groups to obtain control of world resources is the invasion of small and weak countries and the exploitation of small and weak nations. Therefore, rebuilding the world with the democracy of the UK and the US is tantamount to advocating that murderers and robbers should act as world police to maintain law and order. There is no danger to all mankind greater than this. Therefore, if all mankind cannot be liberated from the invasion of British and American imperialism and the exploitation of capitalism, and a new world of coexistence and co-prosperity for all mankind cannot be established under a new order based on morality, world peace cannot be established. But I also deeply believe that communism will not be able to achieve the ideal of world peace. Considering mankind as a material, no matter how lofty the thought is, it is nothing more than the function of the human body material. The East Asian thought of sacrificing the inner body to serve the great righteousness as the highest morality cannot be tolerated. Wen Tianxiang, a loyal minister of the late Song Dynasty in China, was forced to surrender to the Yuan Dynasty after the fall of the Song Dynasty. He was imprisoned in the main room for three years without surrendering his will. He chanted the Song of Righteousness in the earthen room and was executed. This has fully demonstrated the true East Asian spirit. Standing on this unique East Asian spiritualism and establishing a new order based on morality, regardless of the color of black and white, regardless of the presence or absence of property, we should treat all mankind as brothers and sisters, and protect and realize their coexistence and co-prosperity to build a new world. Apart from this, there is no road to world peace in the world. The Greater East Asia War has not yet lasted a year since the start of the war, and the important strongholds of Britain, the United States, and the Netherlands in East Asia have been almost completely destroyed. Australia and India will soon break away from the shackles of Britain. To this end, all the peoples of Greater East Asia, from Japan, China, and Manchuria in the north to Thailand, Vietnam, the Malay Peninsula, and other islands, large and small, and from the coast of New Zealand in the east to India in the west, are establishing a new order of human coexistence and co-prosperity. Only in this way can Asia become the birthplace of a new civilization that shines on the world. Japan respects China's independence and expects China to be reborn as an independent and autonomous new country. The three countries of Japan, China, and Manchukuo are based on the great spirit of joint defense, joint economy, and joint culture to establish an alliance. Taking this as the core of building the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, they cooperate with each other to complete the great task of reviving Asia. Apart from this, there is no ambition. The Basic Treaty signed by Chairman Wang and Special Envoy Abe in Nanjing, the capital of China, on November 30 of the previous year stated in the first article that the two countries respect each other's sovereignty and territory and pay attention to the means of mutual assistance and harmony in various aspects such as politics, economy, and culture. In the seventh article, it is also agreed to respond to the development of the new Sino-Japanese relationship. The Japanese government abolished Japan's inherent extraterritorial rights in China and returned the concessions. Not only are China, Japan, and Manchukuo geographically adjacent to each other, almost as one, but they also stand on the relationship of the same culture and the same race and have the spirit of independence and autonomy. It is not an exaggeration to say that they are a large family that should shoulder a common destiny, cooperate with each other, and complete the great task of reviving Asia. Therefore, the people of the three countries of China, Japan, and Manchukuo should support each other like brothers and sisters, protect one family together, and work together to revive Asia with the spirit of one family. Sharing what we have and compensating for each other's shortcomings, and uniting our total strength, this is the large family principle that Chang Xiang has been advocating to the people of China, Japan, and Manchukuo. I deeply hope that the people of the three countries of China, Japan, and Manchukuo will be of one mind, share joys and sorrows, and truly be a large family working together to complete the great task of reviving Asia. However, there are still many difficulties in completing the great task of reviving Asia. However, no matter what difficulties we encounter, because Heaven has given us the task of pioneering this great cause and made us born in this era to become a great nation capable of completing this great cause, we are grateful to Heaven, fulfill the expectations of our mothers, and strive to complete its great destiny and comfort Mr. Sun's spirit in heaven.

### German Troops in the Caucasus Break Through Soviet Positions in Several Places in the Terek

Wilkie Inspects the Erzhev Front

Haitong News Agency Telegram from the German Headquarters, 26th

This afternoon's German war report stated that German and Allied forces in the Caucasus and Terek, with the assistance of German aircraft, broke through several strong enemy positions. The fighting in Stalingrad is fierce. German troops occupied the party headquarters near the Volga River. The fighting around Voronezh is ongoing.

Havas News Agency Telegram from Stockholm, 26th

According to the German side, the fighting in the Stalingrad city area is no longer a mobile war. Tank movement is very difficult in the intermittent rain and broken walls, and the two armies are facing each other at close range, making it difficult for the air force to bomb without fear of collateral damage. Intermittent rain and broken walls are more conducive to defense than civilian houses. This has been proven in the previous world war. On the Terek River front, German troops have broken through the Red Army's defense line on the south bank. The location seems to be in Prichivskaya, which may be the first step towards invading the two cities of Krozny and Voronizhski. As for the Erzhev front, the Soviet army is still in an active position and is constantly attacking the German defense line.

Havas News Agency Telegram from Berlin, 26th

According to German sources, German stormtroopers have reached the banks of the Volga River in several places near Stalingrad. Although the Ugrpo barracks, granaries, public buildings, and schools in the city have been bombed by German aircraft and are in flames, they are still used by the Red Army as resistance strongholds. After fierce fighting, German troops have occupied dozens of buildings in the city. Sappers are clearing mines from the streets day and night. The city is filled with smoke, and the advanced troops are unable to contact the rear troops by telephone, so they have to fire rockets as signals. In the Stalingrad fire pit, both food and ammunition supplies are needed, and the wounded must be transported back, which greatly hinders the progress of the German troops.

Allied Press Telegram from Moscow, 26th

US President Roosevelt's special envoy Wilkie visited the Erzhev front on Thursday. The area is located 130 miles northwest of Moscow. The fighting has been very fierce there for several weeks. When Wilkie inspected, corpses were lying everywhere and infantry fought fiercely all day long.

Haitong News Agency Telegram from Angara, 26th

Yesterday, a telegram from Moscow stated that Roosevelt's special envoy Wilkie stayed on the Erzhev front for two days and nights, inspected the war lines in various districts, and talked with Soviet officers and soldiers from time to time. Those traveling with Wilkie included Soviet Lieutenant General Lisenko, known as a Soviet hero, US Brigadier General Whiteley, and US military attaché to the Soviet Union, Colonel Mitchler. After Wilkie returned to Moscow, he told people that what he saw at the front was extremely moving and that he had not slept for two nights and only felt tired now. He slept soundly for fifteen hours.

Havas News Agency Telegram from Washington, 25th

Colonel Tillson, commander of the Serra Artillery Regiment, has been transferred to another position today. In his farewell speech yesterday, he said that northern Scandinavia may become the starting point for the Allied offensive. If the Allies can occupy the northern part of the Scandinavian Peninsula, they can guarantee the transportation between the Soviet Union and Western countries, further cooperate with each other, and access Sweden's iron ore sand. This raw material is extremely important to Germany's military industry. Therefore, Germany should pay close attention to the development of the north. However, Germany's occupation of Norway has gained a preemptive advantage. Sweden should also take military measures to prevent possible attacks under this situation.

### Japanese Embassy to Celebrate the Anniversary of the Tripartite Pact with a Tea Party Today

Today (the 27th) marks the second anniversary of the signing of the Tripartite Pact between Japan, Germany, and Italy. To celebrate this occasion, the Japanese Embassy in Nanjing will hold a grand tea party at 6:00 PM this afternoon on the eighth floor of the Cathay Hotel on the Bund in Nanjing. Minister Horiuchi will host the event, and heads of various Shanghai-based organizations from China, Germany, Italy, and Manchukuo, as well as the German and Italian ambassadors, Ambassador Stahmer and Ambassador De Lollis, will attend the grand event.

Minister Horiuchi Delivers a Speech

On the occasion of the second anniversary of the signing of the Tripartite Pact between Japan, Germany, and Italy, the Japanese Minister to China, Mr. Horiuchi, delivered a speech, stating that the signing of the Tripartite Pact stipulated that the three countries would assist each other in all political, economic, and military matters. At that time, Germany and Italy were already at war with England and France, achieving successive victories. Subsequently, on December 8th of last year, Japan also initiated hostilities with England and the United States. Therefore, the three countries signed a new treaty on December 11th of last year, agreeing to (1) wage war against England and the United States until final victory is achieved; (2) not to cease fighting or make peace separately; (3) cooperate after the war to build a just order. They are jointly fighting to build a new world order. Japan is winning every battle in East Asia, establishing the foundation of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere in the vast regions of the Pacific and Indian Oceans, in a position of certain victory and invincibility. In Europe, the Allied forces of Germany and Italy have also established a position of certain victory and invincibility. Thus, the three countries have laid a solid foundation capable of coping with long-term warfare. Today, they are launching a final offensive against England and the United States with the close cooperation and powerful combat capabilities of the three countries. The war will enter a stage of annihilating the enemy's resistance. The purpose of the three countries' war has been stated in the preamble of the Tripartite Pact, which is to build a new world order. Therefore, before breaking the old order of England and the United States and ensuring the coexistence and co-prosperity of all nations in the world, any compromise or expediency will be eliminated in order to achieve the goal. At this important moment, on the occasion of the second anniversary of the Tripartite Pact, it is firmly believed that our renewed expression of the Allied countries' determination for war is the significance of the commemoration.

Colonel Kamata Clarifies Significance

On the occasion of the second anniversary of the signing of the Tripartite Pact between Japan, Germany, and Italy, Colonel Kamata, the Press Officer of the Japanese Fleet in China, gave a speech in which he stated that the war launched by Japan, Germany, and Italy to shatter the self-serving system of the Treaty of Versailles and the Treaty of Washington, which aimed to dominate the world, and to create a noble and bright new order, was a historical necessity that was not at all surprising. The content of the Tripartite Pact stipulated that Japan recognizes and respects Germany and Italy's guiding position in building a new order in Europe. The significance of the Tripartite Pact is to liberate the nations under the old shackles and at the same time to build a new world order. Japan's goal is to enable all nations to find their place, to restore the true nature of all nations in the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, and to achieve the great harmony of the world through harmony, cooperation, coexistence, and co-prosperity. Viewing the above points, the Tripartite Pact is not hostile to any country but is a strong partnership for the common purpose of building a new world order. The outbreak of the Greater East Asia War on December 8th of last year has already cleared away the British and American monopolistic forces that had dominated East Asia for centuries. Within ten days, it has established a firm and unshakable naval control in the Southwest Pacific. Currently, the Japanese Navy has advanced into the Atlantic Ocean and is fighting alongside the navies of the Axis powers. However, we are not arrogant about victory because the Tripartite Pact is eagerly demanding that Japan build a new order in the Greater East Asia sphere, and its expectations for Germany and Italy to build a new order in Europe are gradually increasing. As a result of this war, the cultural flowers of the Eastern and Western Co-Prosperity Spheres have each blossomed. We firmly believe that the triumphal song of the First Tripartite Pact between Japan, Germany, and Italy has resonated throughout the clouds.

German and Italian Consuls-General Express Their Thoughts

The German Consul-General and the Italian Consul-General also delivered speeches stating that the Tripartite Pact affirms the friendly and cooperative relationship between Japan, Germany, and Italy, whether in the fields of war, politics, or economics. The spirit of the Tripartite Pact clearly demonstrates that this is a spirit of cooperation towards building a new world order.

Public Concession Street Lights Drastically Reduced

The street lights in the Hongkou District were extinguished long ago, and only a few remain at important intersections. Starting the night before last, the street lights on Nanjing Road, the most prosperous area of the Old Zha District, also began to be extinguished, leaving only a few lights at the cross streets. The Jing'an Temple District and the Chengdu District have also been reduced. Therefore, when the Datong News Agency reporter strolled the streets last night, Shanghai seemed to be wearing a black sleeping gown, and the night scene was extremely quiet.

### Tram Company and Police Cooperate to Crack Down on Pickpocketing; Expanded Publicity Campaign to Begin Early Next Month

According to the Shanghai Times, the Shanghai Tram Company has decided to cooperate with the police to eliminate petty theft, especially pickpocketing. It is reported that the company has formulated measures to launch a large-scale campaign starting in early October. At that time, posters will be posted in various trams and stations in the Public Concession, and people will be hired to speak inside the trams and at the stations to urge the public to be careful of petty theft. The campaign is planned to last for one month, and the color posters will be changed every week to expose the pickpockets' methods, along with warnings to be careful of pickpockets. It has been found that the police have recently stepped up the crackdown on petty theft. When the tram company cooperates to launch the campaign, detectives will be dispatched to assist the tram staff in clearing out pickpockets. At the same time, the public's assistance is still needed. Pay attention at all times and report suspicious persons to the ticket seller or patrolmen. The public should pay special attention to pickpockets when boarding the tram when it is crowded or when the tram is full.

### Government Bonds Turn from Exuberance to Weakness

Yesterday's over-the-counter market for government bonds continued to weaken due to persistent selling pressure. With many seeking to reduce their holdings and others selling short, market sentiment turned from exuberance to weakness, and the situation may continue. However, the fundamentals and the major long positions remained unchanged, so there is unlikely to be a sharp decline. Lianyi continued to sell, and the number of shares was huge, so there must be a basis. The future may continue to fluctuate due to the reduction of overbought positions. Grade C bonds opened strongly, with a high price of 7.3 yuan, but selling pressure suddenly increased, and the small price was 6 yuan. The final price also rose slightly to 6.3 yuan. The market price of Grade A bonds was the same as that of Grade C bonds. Grade B bonds were still less than Grade C and Grade D bonds by 1.2 yuan, the largest decrease. Small numbers of cents to one yuan or so were transacted. There are no statistics yet. The 28th is Confucius' birthday, and the market will be closed.

### Interbank Loan Rates Remain Unchanged, Military Notes Slightly Firmer

Yesterday, the interbank loan rate announced by the Money Dealers Association remained unchanged at one dime and four cents.

Japanese military notes were slightly firmer. The interbank trading price was 5.5557 yuan, and the retail price at small money shops was 5.565 yuan, while the purchase price was 5.545 yuan, the same as the previous day.

### Gold and Silver Prices Remain Unchanged

Yesterday, the retail price of jewelry gold at Dashin and other jewelry stores in the city was still 2,450 yuan per tael (purchase price less than 300 yuan). The interbank trading price was initially high at 2,270 yuan, then slightly decreased to 2,260 yuan. At noon, it slightly increased to 2,270 yuan, up 25 yuan from the previous day. The difference between the buying and selling prices was 10 yuan. Transactions were sluggish. The retail price of ornament silver was still 14 yuan. The interbank trading price was 13.45 yuan.

### Cloth Merchants Lower Prices on Piece Goods

Yesterday, the market for factory cloth started firm but weakened later, mainly because Eastern cloth continued to fall in price. Retailers followed suit, selling off their inventory. The price of white cloth, both coarse and fine, dropped by 1.5 to 2 yuan per piece. 16-pound "Globe" coarse cloth was priced at 188 yuan, "Flying Goose" at 186 yuan, 8-pound "Zhenzhong" at 107.5 yuan, 12-pound "Globe" fine cloth at 164 yuan, "Big Peng" at 556 yuan, "Fugui" at 153.5 yuan, and "Qin Meiren" yuan cloth at 135 yuan. "Lunhua" red cloth was priced at 175 yuan, and black cloth at 145 yuan. Peach blossom, ladies' and "Lin" cloth opened strong at 256.5 yuan, but later declined to 255.25 yuan. "Chick" shirting was priced at 245 yuan, also falling by about 2 yuan.

Eastern cloth prices softened due to continued sales of spot goods by foreign firms. 12-pound "Dragon Head" fine cloth, new single, was priced at 175.5 yuan, down 1.5 yuan. Bank-issued "Dragon Head" fell to 160.5 yuan, a further drop of 2 yuan. "Colorful Ball" fine cloth was priced at 160.5 yuan, "Flying Fish" at 159 yuan, "Yang He" at 157 yuan, "Laba" at 155 yuan, and "Blue Double Fish" at 154 yuan. "Four Gentlemen" serge, red ticket, started at 7.16 yuan, dropping to 7.06 yuan, and recovered to 7.09 yuan at the afternoon close, a drop of 7 cents. Bank-issued serge, priced at 6.8 yuan, fell significantly by 10 cents.

### Coarse Sugar Shares Slightly Lower

Yesterday, the trend for sugar shares at the Sugar Merchants' Cooperative Business Office was slightly soft. Due to it being Saturday, there was little trading. The Public Association's coarse sugar shares opened at 303 yuan unchanged, then fell 1 yuan to close at 300 yuan, with a total of 700 bags traded. There were no transactions in brown sugar shares.

### Black Date Merchants Continue Efforts

Black date merchants continue their unrelenting efforts. Yesterday, quoted prices rose again, with the highest opening at 500 yuan, and the next highest at 480 yuan. The market followed suit, raising prices. It is reported that more new black dates have arrived in Nanjing, all acquired by Beijing merchants. The second quotation rose by 20 yuan.

### New Dried Lily Bulbs Arrive in Suzhou

It is reported that new dried lily bulbs have arrived in Suzhou. Because Shanghai merchants are not interested in purchasing, they are being sold locally. Demand in the domestic market here remains sluggish, so even though new goods have been delayed, the market remains stable with no expectation of price increases. Currently, Zhuang Chen goods on the market are quoted at 220-230 yuan, with slightly lower prices for secondary goods.

### Grain Transactions Sluggish

Grain transactions were exceptionally sluggish yesterday due to a lack of arrivals and a shortage of supply, resulting in an unusually quiet market. Occasional transactions were weak. Five bags of Tianjin red beans were traded at a price of 162 yuan. Eight bags of Taixing melon seeds were priced at 465 yuan per sima dan (unit of weight), husked.

### Bamboo Ribbed Steel Bars Still Struggle

Nail Transactions Sporadic

Yesterday, the market for bamboo ribbed steel bars remained sluggish. Local construction firms have very little demand for this product. Retailers and speculators have shown even less interest recently, making it difficult for the bamboo ribbed steel market to flourish, causing uncertainty and stagnant prices. Yesterday, 3-4 point sizes were selling for 11,500 yuan per ton, and 5 point to 1 inch sizes were selling for 11,000 yuan per ton. Furthermore, the market for locally produced round nails has stalled due to a lack of demand from Nanyang merchants and weak interest from merchants from the Yangtze River and North China regions. Currently, only the Shanghai market is active. Demand from construction firms is also declining. Scattered business from small workshops and retailers is slightly better, with prices at 700 yuan per barrel, but the market is weakening.

### Loosening of Tight Supply as Hongkou Releases Japanese Cigarettes

Sales prices for British-American cigarettes are firm due to smooth sales and good selection by buyers. The cigarette market has shifted from tight to loose as the China Tobacco Company has managed sales of Japanese cigarettes. They announced registration, and cigarettes were released from warehouses in Hongkou. The trend of weak sales for national cigarettes remains. British Brand cigarettes are priced at 8350 yuan, Old Knife Brand at 6650 yuan, 品海 Brand at 6300 yuan, Fairy Brand at 5250 yuan, and Five Hua Brand at 5400 yuan, all with slight variations from the previous day's prices. Japanese cigarettes: Golden Spear Brand at 2570 yuan, Golden Building at 2800 yuan, Red Rose at 1950 yuan, Quanlu Brand at 2850 yuan, Nianzhi packaged at 2600 yuan, and Guide Brand at 2300 yuan.

Family

### The Beginning of a Happy Family

— Reporter

The Scholarship Fund for readers of this newspaper has been running from July of last year to mid-September of this year, for a total of three sessions. Although the number of people approved for each of these three sessions has been around 1,000, the amount of scholarship money spent has increased. The first session spent over 33,700 yuan, the second session spent almost double that, and the third session will likely spend close to 150,000 yuan. As for the number of applicants, it has been increasing with each session, indicating that in this short year or so, the soaring cost of living has greatly impacted tuition fees, and the number of families in society who need assistance with tuition to enable their children to continue their education is increasing day by day.

In every family, there are always some school-age children, and parents invariably hope that their children can receive a reasonable education within their means. As a result, the expenditure on education accounts for a significant portion of the annual expenses of middle-class families. Many enthusiastic readers of this newspaper who contribute to the scholarship fund not only care about the future of their own children but also use their spare capacity to help others, allowing them to continue their studies this semester. Those who benefit are undoubtedly grateful, and it also expresses a great and pure sense of sympathy for their parents and siblings.

Society is like a family. Everyone should not only help each other but also provide proactive and constructive mutual assistance, enriching every family member and enabling them to develop healthily in terms of morality, intelligence, and physical fitness. This is the beginning of creating a happy family and indirectly strengthening the foundation of society and increasing the happiness of the community.

### Gifted Children

— Jing

People generally misunderstand that a gifted child must be physically weak, with drooping shoulders, or have a particularly large head or a particularly protruding forehead. In reality, true gifted children do not necessarily possess these characteristics.

According to practical experiments, a uniquely gifted child is taller and weighs more than a child with average talent. However, there are exceptions, and this cannot be generalized. Most parents ultimately like their children to be good-looking because they believe that this is a sign of intelligence. However, this is not always the case. Don't we have a saying in our country, "A clever face, a foolish heart?"

In reality, a more talented child must come from an outstanding family. An outstanding family must have a handsome couple to create them. Many great figures have parents and ancestors who were outstanding individuals, especially the father. Children born to fathers with specialized professions, such as lawyers, doctors, and educators, are often more outstanding than children born to ordinary merchants.

Naturally, children's innate talent is important, but postnatal education is also extremely important. Many self-taught successful individuals do not believe in the concept of talent at all. Edison once said that the creation of genius is 5% inspiration and 95% perspiration. Those of us who are not yet parents should pay attention to self-cultivation, and those who are already parents should focus on family education because cultivating outstanding citizens is our responsibility to society and the country.

### Child Mental Health (II)

— Dr. Gui Zhiliang

As various branches of modern medicine continue to advance, pediatric experts have firmly acknowledged that children are not simply small adults because all childhood diseases have their own unique symptoms, medical history, and treatment. In other words, there are differences in quantity and many differences in quality.

While children's physical health is certainly very important, it would be too one-sided to only pay attention to their physical well-being without considering their intelligence, morality, and emotions. Therefore, educators and psychologists strongly advocate that children have their own unique value for research. These analytical studies have made significant contributions to child mental health because child mental health is a synthesis of materials gathered by various experts, with the child's entire personality and reactions at the center. We no longer waste precious time and energy arguing about whether education, heredity, or environment has the greatest impact on children. We want to pay attention to the child themselves, their comprehensive personality, and their reactions to all their heredity, environment, emotional impulses, educational results, and so on. If unhealthy signs are discovered at any time, we immediately seek ways to guide, drain, or replace them to avoid the development of serious mental illness in the future. Preventing disease in the future is a more effective and economical approach.

When it comes to mental treatment, people often ask suspiciously, "Can you treat disordered thoughts? Can you instill knowledge into children with low intelligence? What assurance do you have in treating various mental illnesses?" As a result, psychiatry has become something that fools advocate and wise people avoid. This attitude is mostly due to ignorance, not malice. Localized thought disorders can often achieve good results through psychological treatment. Emotional disorders, with adequate time and proper nutrition, often recover as well. As for stubborn thought disorders, shock therapy with insulin can sometimes produce good results. Regarding children with low intelligence, although we are unable to increase their innate talent, we can help them choose work that their intelligence allows. Since children with low intelligence are easily persuaded to become criminals in society, we can also guide the parents of these children to curb their unrealistic expectations and prevent them from forcing these poor children to do work that they are intellectually incapable of handling.

In short, mental health focuses on the child's entire personality and all their reactions. Mental health can prevent the development of mental illness and can also provide considerable treatment for various illnesses, as well as provide appropriate guidance for children with unstable intelligence or emotions. In other words, mental health can enable every child and adult to enjoy a richer and more fulfilling life.

### Household Tips

Milk easily absorbs the odor of other foods, so it should be covered and placed in a cold place.

When cleaning glass windows, it is advisable to use kerosene and water so that rain stains do not remain when it rains.

When boiling eggs, adding a few drops of vinegar to the water can keep the eggs intact.

Adding a little vinegar to detergent can make the cleaned utensils more shiny and dazzling.

To use soap effectively, first scrub with sweet potatoes.

To make iced tea, the tea must be brewed extra strong and then poured over ice cubes.

If you want to fertilize flowers and plants, you can save eggshells, soak them in water for two or three days, and then use them.

When hanging curtains, you should separate them on both sides. You should first consider the range that your hands can reach so that both sides are even.

### Twenty Letters from Mr. Gates

— Xu Baiyi respectfully

Mr. Gates's son originally suggested traveling to Europe after graduating from Harvard University. After Mr. Gates explained in his fourth letter, he willingly canceled his suggestion and reported to the food company founded by Mr. Gates to begin serving. This made his father very happy, so he contributed many valuable life experiences.

Fifth Letter

To my son, who is newly entering the business world:

The letter you sent on the 4th is more reasonable and contains great significance, which makes me very happy. This letter is more practical than your previous ones, which reminds me of a condition that business people must fulfill: ① have something to say, ② say those words, ③ stop talking. When you visit your girlfriend or friends, you may speak as much as a pastor, but in the business world, you must keep it simple. For example, the best part of making a sandwich is the meat in the middle. There is no problem putting some cheese close to the meat on the bread, as long as the eater likes cheese, otherwise it is superfluous.

You must also remember that a person is not wise because of the amount of talk. A clever person ultimately speaks less than others and spends more time listening to others. Rich people often speak carelessly and cause resentment from others. Poor people also reveal their poverty by talking too much. I carefully contribute these life experiences to you for your reference in dealing with the world.

Of course, I am very happy that you are willing to come to the company to serve. However, you will encounter many difficulties at first. Many young people have come to the company to serve, but they soon left because in the first week, they were afraid of being dismissed by the company; in the second week, they were afraid of not being dismissed. By the third week, a young person with no skills can know that they can only do very little and try their best to keep their job. A young person with some skills will be doing the company's business while also paying attention to higher and better positions in the company.

Before you come to the company to serve, you should muster your enthusiasm. After you come to the company, you should work hard and move forward. Then, at the end of the year, you can participate in the list of promotions and salary increases.

A person's love for their children is inseparable from their self-esteem, so I love you and I love my career. Therefore, I hope that you can integrate with my career. To do this, you must have a good start and then work hard constantly. In novels, you can see phrases such as "love at first sight," but there is no such thing in the business world. In fact, if you want to obtain and maintain a good position, you must leave early and return late and use all your energy.

I once had a colleague who hoped to quickly become a rich man. Every day at 8 pm, he would design his ideal business, but tomorrow would still be just a dream. There are many people in society like him who only know how to use their ideals to become a millionaire overnight, not knowing how to earn five yuan in cash in a day.

Don't think that it is meaningless for me to tell you these life experiences often. I think they can save you from many losses. When you join the company on the 15th, you can go directly to see the Irishman, Mr. Miggen. I think it is best for you to rush to Chicago on the 14th because Mr. Miggen works very seriously. Before you join the company, I hope I can give you some necessary instructions.

Your father, Gates

### A Week's Home Cooking Menu

— Ms. Hua Ying

Soybean sprouts are a very common food that can be bought at any time of the year, so they are never taken seriously. However, they are very rich in protein, which is very important for human nutrition. It should not be underestimated. I have never liked soybean sprouts, but because they are rich in protein, I eat them several times a week as a supplement. The meat version can be braised with beef, pork, or mutton, which is very chewy. The vegetarian version is simplest when braised with fried dough sticks. When making soup with other vegetables, it has a unique flavor, similar to chicken soup or ham soup in meat dishes. For family economic considerations and for physical nutrition, we should advocate eating more soybean sprouts.

### Third Scholarship Report of Shen Bao Readers Scholarship Fund

Since the launch of the Scholarship Fund movement for readers of this newspaper, we have been warmly supported by people from all walks of life, and the colleagues have been increasingly self-improving, adhering to this vocation and doing their best to show the results. Now that the third Scholarship Fund is coming to an end, we respectfully publish the income and expenditure report for public announcement.

Application Review

The Scholarship Fund was prepared from June 20th and applications started from July 21st. The review was held after July 28th. During the review, middle and primary school groups were held on August 2nd at the YMCA on Sichuan Road. Due to the different levels and courses of study, university, tutoring, and free groups were given interviews and surveys respectively. The entire review was completed at the end of August.

Scholarship Amount

The approved scholarship amount for the university group is 250 yuan as the highest standard. However, those who study engineering and have higher classes will be increased to 300 yuan. This situation applies to seven people. Other schools have different natures, so the tuition fees charged also vary greatly. The highest tuition fee is 300 yuan and the lowest is 40 yuan. The middle school, primary school, and tutoring groups are all issued according to the tuition fees of the schools attended by the students. Fees such as books and magazines are not allowed. Therefore, the highest tuition fee for the middle school group is 225 yuan, the lowest is 32 yuan, the highest for the primary school group is 130 yuan, and the lowest is 16 yuan. For students who have schools that are given free quotas by the museum for review and Zhang Jun are introduced to the school for free without giving additional scholarships. These students are included in the free group calculation. There are 20 middle school students, 12 tutoring students, and 32 orphans in total, which are included in the middle school group.

Issuance Process

When issuing scholarship checks, the primary school group started earlier on August 17th. The middle school and tutoring groups started on August 21st and 24th respectively. The university group was extended by the committee, so the review was not completed until the end of August. The scholarship checks were issued from the 31st to September 20th. The remaining unclaimed checks are considered canceled. One check for the middle school group and six checks for the university group were cancelled. The other three groups have been fully issued.

After the scholarship checks were issued, 52 students came to change schools, most of whom were in the middle school group with a total of 37 people.

In addition, Cheng Hua Pharmaceutical Factory donated 300 boxes of Ding's ointment and Mr. Pu Jiting donated 100 wheat coupons totaling 200 pounds, which have been distributed to middle and primary school students with the scholarship.
