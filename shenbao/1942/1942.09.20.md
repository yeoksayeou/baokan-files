A large number of artillery pieces are being transported from the Don River area along the road to the front lines in preparation for the attack on the city.

Furthermore, troops are advancing from Voronezh in four directions in the hope of relieving the siege of Stalingrad. It is said that the scale of this new offensive is very large.

Moscow, 18th (Havas News Agency Dispatch)

The Red Army General Headquarters has just released a war report stating that our forces continued to fight fiercely northwest of Stalingrad and in the Mozdok region tonight.

The General Headquarters announced this morning that the battle on the Stalingrad front is progressing smoothly. The enemy's diversionary offensive on the northern route has been repelled and 120 tanks have been destroyed. The enemy's counter-offensive in the Voronezh area has also been repelled.

Stockholm, 19th (Havas News Agency Dispatch)

German newspapers are extensively reporting on the battle on the Eastern Front (central hub) near the city of Rzhev. It is claimed that Soviet troops in that area have launched several attacks with five times the manpower (approximately four armies in total). The German troops were initially repelled but are still holding the urban area. Soviet troops have been unable to break through the German lines. The German troops are using all their reserves to assist in the battle and have managed to turn the situation around. The Red Army is continuing to reinforce their forces and may launch another attack at any time.

Somewhere on the Soviet Border, 18th (Havas News Agency Dispatch)

Today, the Soviet Union is maintaining silence on the situation in Stalingrad, but is making every effort to publicize the progress in the Voronezh area. According to Moscow Radio, after breaking through the enemy's lines on the Voronezh front, Soviet troops are advancing rapidly. At the same time, TASS reported that: 1. Soviet troops have crossed the Don River from both the southeast, and Soviet troops in the northern district of Voronezh have broken through German defenses and occupied several high grounds. 2. In the central Caucasus area, German troops have also switched to the defensive. Although they have launched several attacks against us, they have all been repelled. 3. On the western Caucasus route, southeast of Novorossiysk, our forces are still holding their original positions. 4. There was also fierce air combat on the northern front near Leningrad yesterday, as German troops attempted to conduct reconnaissance and bomb our military targets. According to the Red Star newspaper, there is currently fierce fighting in a certain area of the central front. Although German troops are putting up a strong resistance and have launched several counter-attacks, they have all been repelled so far. However, the newspaper did not mention the location of the fighting, but it is likely referring to the area along the Rzhev-Vyazma line. Continued on page 3.

Berlin, 19th (Haitong News Agency Dispatch)

The German Foreign Ministry's mouthpiece, the German Foreign Policy News, published an article yesterday welcoming the appointment of Kazuo Aoki as Japanese Foreign Minister.

### Grew's Public Speech in the United States: Deep Understanding of Japan

Argentina Capital, 19th (Central News Agency Dispatch)

Former American Ambassador to Japan, Joseph Grew, gave his third public speech in Syracuse, New York on the 18th after returning to the United States from his diplomatic post. He stated that it is impossible to collapse Japan unless Japanese manpower and material resources are completely depleted to the point where they cannot fight. If the United Nations wants to restore peace in the Pacific, it must deal with Japan to strive for a thorough victory. I have been in Japan for a long time and have a deep understanding of Japan. The Japanese cannot be subdued. The Japanese cannot collapse spiritually, psychologically, or economically, and will endure hardship and strive hard. We must not ignore this point when we want to fight Japan. I remember that when the Japanese army was fighting in China in November 1929, I wrote in my diary that hoping for the Japanese army to lose its prestige is the same as expecting this world to become heaven. The Japanese soldiers have a close connection with their national citizens, and it is impossible to separate them. Based on the fact that Japan is now at war with the United States, this situation has not changed at all from three years ago.

German advanced tank vehicles and infantry in the northwestern suburbs of the city have also repeatedly attacked Soviet positions. In the past 24 hours, Soviet troops once repelled German infantry that broke into the city and engaged in a tug-of-war of death. However, German artillery units and assault troops finally broke into the Soviet positions at night and built fortifications in tall buildings. The city street positions have been successfully established, so artillery shells are fired from the window openings of all tall buildings. The Soviet troops also used huge buildings to block the German army or machine-gunned them, so the streets were full of corpses and the houses were reduced to a sea of fire. The battle of Stalingrad can be described as extremely tragic.

Vichy, 19th (Haitong News Agency Dispatch)

Madagascar Governor Anet telegraphed the French Colonial Ministry stating that his negotiations with the British military commander have failed. The British demands are difficult to accept, and the only answer is to continue resistance. The French army will do its best.

Vichy, 18th (Havas News Agency Dispatch)

The Colonial Ministry has just issued a public announcement stating that according to news received at 7:00 this morning, the enemy forces landing on Madagascar are strong in strength and large in number and are advancing towards Angajab, 90 miles from the capital of Madagascar. At 9:00 yesterday morning, 20 British warships appeared near Tamatave, bombing the port and urban area. Our army continued to resist. Foreign propaganda claimed that we have stopped resisting, which is absolutely not true. Our soldiers are defending their territory step by step. Despite the disparity in the number of enemies and us, our army is still working hard to fight against the enemy forces equipped with sophisticated weapons such as heavy artillery, tanks, chasing artillery, and armored vehicles. Even in the enemy's reports, they express admiration for the bravery of our army. For example, our army, which was ordered to hold a mountain artillery base about 250 miles from the capital, had only 30 people, but they resisted to the end despite being attacked by a large enemy force and subjected to heavy artillery bombardment and aircraft bombing. Their heroic spirit is enough to last for thousands of years.

### French Concession to Conduct Daily Blackout Drills Next Month

Residents Urged to Complete Indoor Equipment and Submit Lists Promptly

From October 1st to the 10th of this year, the French Concession will conduct blackout drills, training for several hours each day, similar to other areas in the city. The start and end of the training will be based on the instructions of the Air Defense Commander, reported on the XQHA radio station (9th week frequency). The experience gained from the recent drills in various areas of the concession has been quite satisfactory. In particular, factories continue to operate normally, and their lights are not exposed to the outside. However, some residents have not yet completed the indoor equipment and need to implement it quickly. The following points should be paid special attention to during the blackout drills:

Road Lighting

According to general guidance, which will be issued separately.

Lane Lighting

All lights should be specially installed.

Private Lighting

The surroundings of the lamps must be connected to conical or oblong (lampshades), and windows and doors must be fitted with shutters or curtains.

Fire Prevention Equipment

Currently, the fire department and the self-defense corps are practicing fire prevention. Each household should prepare clean water and sand as much as possible for application.

Form Rescue Teams

In case of emergency, rescue teams that have been organized will be dispatched to their assigned police stations, and doctors will go to the hospitals or rescue stations designated for them.

Sweeping teams gather at the locations designated by the Engineering Department, carrying their equipment.

During the drills, positive training should be carried out on the above points in accordance with the guidance of the Air Defense Committee and the cooperation of various public agencies and the public.

The Central District Designated as a Model Air Defense Zone

It is also learned that the Air Defense Committee of the French Concession Police Department has designated the 173rd Lianbao in the Central District as a model air defense zone. The areas of Mailan, Xiaodongmen, Xifei, Fuxu, and Bedang will soon also be designated as a model Lianbao so that other Lianbao can follow suit when equipping air defense equipment. According to a reporter who spoke with a certain Lianbao leader, although the results were excellent during the last blackout alert, the reason was that each household and store turned off all the lights. This did not meet the required standards. In the future, when blackout control is implemented, the lights must be turned on, but black lampshades and curtains must be used to ensure that the lights are not exposed and that indoor work or business operations can proceed as usual without hindrance. The chiefs of various districts and Baojia have already notified each household to prepare air defense lampshades and install them on the lamps. It is not necessary to remove them during the day so that they can be dropped at any time upon hearing an alarm. Air defense committee members, police officers, and Baojia chiefs of the police department will set out in teams immediately to investigate each household in various districts. If any violations are found, they will be punished accordingly. It is also learned that public vehicles in the two concessions have now been ordered to take considerable Satan's measures to meet the needs of blackout control. The upper half of the windows of the red public buses in the French Concession are painted red. When trams operate at night, the route numbers at the front and rear ends will be extinguished, and the small air windows on the upper sides of the car body will be painted black. The light intensity of the electric lights inside the carriage will also be reduced by half. The public buses and trams in the Public Concession will also take similar measures.

### Price Compilation Begins, Vegetable Prices Suppressed and Compiled, Decision on Whether to Announce Violating Stores Undecided

Inagaki, Chief of the Price Compilation Office of the Bureau of Industry, said that the Price Compilation Office has begun to compile the selling prices of small vegetable markets and has achieved considerable success. Unfortunately, the progress of this work is not very far, so the Bureau of Industry has not been able to publish it.

Vegetable Price List

To guide housewives when buying vegetables. Inagaki also said that if a small vegetable market or catering shop lacks pork on a certain day, it may not be caused by the vendors' intention to obstruct the market. The lack of meat is often due to the slightly scarce arrival of goods and the next day's slaughter. Vegetable prices are more difficult to compile than meat prices. Vegetables

Perishable

Its price fluctuates with the season and supply and demand. Experts from the Price Control Office are currently investigating the best way to compile the selling prices of vegetable markets and will do their best to lower the prices of poultry and fruits to the lowest possible level. The method of controlling the supply of various foods is also being studied to achieve the best results. The Japanese Fruit Merchants Association is currently drafting a compilation plan, and the Chinese Fruit Merchants Association has already begun to organize.

He also said that the occurrence of armed robbery cases this year should be attributed to the efforts of the Police Department and the Self-Defense Corps, and the service of the Japanese army should not be ignored. There are currently about 6,000 police officers, 4,000 watchmen, and 450,000 Self-Defense Corps members who can immediately block the scene of an incident. When asked about the possible addition of economic police in the Police Department, he said that this measure would not work in Shanghai because Shanghai is a special city and economic police are insufficient to cope with it.

### Four Ships Operating on the Shanghai-Ningbo Route

Still a Ship Every Four Days, New Ning Shao Engine Damaged

There were originally five ships operating on the Shanghai-Ningbo route: the Naruto Maru and New Ning Shao of the Dongya Shipping Company, the Jing Li and Wan Ji Wan Sheng of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, and the Haitong of the East Zhejiang Shipping Company, for a total of five ships, with each ship departing every four days. Recently, because the number of passengers traveling to Ningbo has decreased greatly and the freight transport is also light, the companies are worried that it will be difficult for each ship to make a profit and are barely maintaining the route. The New Ning Shao departed from Shanghai for Ningbo last Saturday (the 12th) and was originally scheduled to return to Shanghai from Ningbo on the 14th, arrive in Shanghai on the 15th, and depart for Ningbo again on the 16th. Unexpectedly, the engine suddenly broke down when it sailed to Zhenhai on the 14th, so it suspended its trip to Shanghai and telegraphed to Shanghai. The Shanghai company then hired craftsmen and sent personnel to accompany them to Ningbo for repairs. It is heard that the cylinder was ruptured and badly damaged and that it will take three weeks to repair it. The Shanghai-Ningbo line is temporarily operating with four ships, and the schedule remains the same, with a ship every four days. It is also heard that the East Zhejiang Company's Haitong shipping license is about to expire. It is rumored that after the expiration, it will also be managed by the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company.

### Government Bonds Were Only Sporadic Yesterday

Although there is no formal assembly place for government bonds, there is still considerable sporadic trading on their own. Due to the search for avenues for hot money from the gold and yarn gangs, the market price was increased for Standard C bonds, from 2.88 yuan high to 6 yuan, falling back to 4.40 yuan, finally returning to 6 yuan approximately. In addition to the promotion of the above two gangs, the shorts added to the replenishment, resulting in this phenomenon. However, it is felt that the continuous rise in recent days has been too strong, and a correction should be inevitable.

### Jewelry and Silver Unchanged

Yesterday, jewelry gold was still listed at 2,350 yuan per tael for both Daxin and the same industry (about 300 yuan less for purchases), with sparse transactions. Jewelry silver was still listed at 14 yuan per tael, with inter-industry trading at 12.56 yuan.

### Call Loans and Military Notes Were Stable

Yesterday, the call loan rate of the Money Industry Association remained unchanged at 14%.

The inter-industry trading price of Japanese military notes was 5.5546 yuan. Silver shops and small money shops sold them at 5.5565 yuan and bought them at 5.5545 yuan, with no significant difference from the previous day's price.

### Sparse Trade in Grains

Yesterday, the grain market was increasingly deserted due to the temporary martial law, and the trade was increasingly limited due to a shortage of goods. Only 100 bags of Wuhu corn were traded at a price of 130 yuan, and 30 bags of Mingguang red grain were traded at 113.5 yuan for delivery in the South City. There were still retail deliveries of white jute from Pudong, priced at over 350 yuan.

### Sugar Stocks Slightly Flat

The sugar stocks of the Sugar Merchants Cooperative Business Office have been quiet for several days, and the market has turned flat. The association's trading panel set the group sand stock at 307 yuan, which is 0.5 yuan less than on the 15th. Stocks with dividends received were at 303.5 yuan, and red sand stocks were at 303 yuan for 0.5 yuan less. The total transaction was about 2,000 bags.

### Fennel Seed Exports to Qingdao Resurgent

Fennel seed had previously seen a decline in market price due to slow sales, falling by dozens of yuan to 830 yuan. However, recently, exports to Qingdao have resumed, and prices have tightened. Yesterday, the market price was 870 yuan, with some asking for 900 yuan. The market is gradually stabilizing.

### Cigarettes Return to Original Trading Range

The cigarette market opened with the momentum of the previous day, and prices continued to rise. However, due to the wait-and-see attitude of general speculators and the stagnation of stockpiles, prices returned to the same level as the previous day. The market situation was quite tortuous and trending upward. British brands were priced at 8,300 yuan, Old Knife brand at 6,250 yuan, Pinhai brand at 6,000 yuan, Wuhua brand at 5,150 yuan, Fairy brand at 4,850 yuan, Japanese cigarettes Jinqiang brand at 2,450 yuan, Jin Dalou brand at 2,700 yuan, Red Rose at 1,850 yuan, Quanlu brand at 2,700 yuan, Nianzhizhuang at 2,450 yuan, and Guide brand new goods at 2,150 yuan. National cigarettes: Pyramid at 4,650 yuan, Beautiful brand at 4,200 yuan, and Golden Mouse brand at 2,900 yuan, White Golden Dragon at 3,150 yuan. The above purchase prices were all sticky.

### Watermelon Seeds Gradually Appear

Since the appearance of new watermelon seeds, the market price has remained persistently high due to a lack of demand. Recently, however, small and large quantities have gradually arrived. Currently, large slices from Xuzhou are priced at 630 yuan, seeds from Jizhong at 600 yuan, Kuizi from Xuzhou at 550 yuan, and seeds from Mingguang at 455 yuan.

### Sales of Rainproof Cloth Surge

Sales of rainproof cloth have surged due to the cooling weather, coupled with the continuous rain in the past two days. Customer demand is rising across the board. However, sales prices have also been voluntarily reduced in accordance with the authorities' intention to stabilize prices. Yesterday, Yousheng Jintai rainproof cloth was quoted at 23 yuan per yard (having previously sold for as high as 27 yuan), Rentai Orangutan Tarzan sold for 20 yuan, Liangyou sold for 18.5 yuan, and Dameng brand rainproof serge sold for 21 yuan.
