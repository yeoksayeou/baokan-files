### Shanghai Education Problems

Shanghai has always been the cultural center of the country, and education is especially developed. From primary schools to universities, the number of schools, the number of students, and all equipment and facilities rank first in the country. Over the decades, it has cultivated countless talents. However, since the Sino-Japanese War, Shanghai's education has also entered a state of great depression, following the stagnation of the entire culture. This new trend has two different meanings:

First, to be honest, Shanghai's education in the past was filled with the implications of the enslavement education implemented by British and American imperialists in the colonies. Although there have been many reform movements in methods, such as experimental education and the Dalton Plan, in terms of the content and purpose of education, the main goal was not to cultivate construction talents for the country, but to train compradors and tools for the colonial interests of British and American imperialists in China! In the past few decades, China has had new education, which must be considered a blessing from "European winds and American rains," but this new education has also brought new shackles. During this period, many talents have been sacrificed. After the Sino-Japanese War, especially after December 8th last year, the power of British and American imperialism in China began to collapse, breaking the shackles of Shanghai's education accumulated over the years. At the same time, due to the war, some schools and teachers have left Shanghai. Schools that were originally distributed in small cities near Shanghai have also avoided to the "isolated island" in recent years due to environmental factors. Thus, in terms of quantity, Shanghai's education is not less than before the war, and may even have increased; however, in terms of quality, there is no doubt that it has greatly declined! In addition, Shanghai's economic situation is different from what it was a few years ago. Every citizen deeply feels the increased burden of life. The impact on education is that most experienced and well-positioned educational workers have to change careers to engage in commerce or engage in other industries part-time, unable to concentrate on the sacred cause of education; and many people who were not originally educational workers use education as a tool for profit, and use various meanings to create or take over schools at all levels. Their purpose is only to profit, and of course they will not care about the sacred mission of "education." This situation cannot but make people feel regretful that they have escaped from the old cage only to fall into new shackles!

This new crisis seems to have begun to attract the attention of the authorities and all parties recently. Therefore, articles discussing Shanghai's education problems often appear in newspapers! We believe that this is a very important issue, and it has too much to do with the future of China. Not only should the authorities conduct serious and practical discussions with experts from all parties with a broad vision and a frank and sincere attitude in order to seek the independent development of Chinese education, but we also hope that the education community in Shanghai will recognize their own responsibilities, recognize their right to speak out, and the possible role they can play, and propose concrete opinions from the long-term perspective of China's future.

As for the solution to Shanghai's education problems at present, as far as our limited knowledge is concerned, we believe that the following points are quite important. First of all, in response to the current widespread instability in the Shanghai education community, we should try to stabilize it, especially large and small schools and specialized schools with history, so that the organizers and faculty can be assured of maintaining the schools, assured of continuing education work, and not think otherwise. At the same time, we must strive to eliminate unstable factors in the education community, such as ensuring the safety of life of faculty members in political aspects, and ensuring the public activities of all legal schools and educational institutions, and in social and public opinion aspects, give the education community more assistance, and show the necessary respect to teachers and educators.

Secondly, during the stabilization period, we must also strive to ensure that students can study seriously, studying things that are conducive to developing students' talents and then serving the community and society. Here, on the one hand, we must compile textbooks and supplementary reading materials in large quantities and with precision. During the transition period, the original textbooks in the market should be reviewed and approved for temporary application to remedy the heartbreaking phenomenon that some schools currently lack textbooks and students learn nothing because of the various random sources they pull from; on the other hand, we must improve the current – actually, the educational system in schools that has been accumulating for many years – and appropriately correct the proportion of each subject, reduce or eliminate unnecessary subjects to reduce the burden on students and allow them to concentrate on the study of major and necessary subjects, so that they will not spend all day learning in a debt-like and indiscriminate way, and in fact know nothing about each subject.

Finally, and also very important, is (1) assisting the lives of faculty members. The hardship of the lives of faculty members at present is something that cannot be imagined by those who are well-fed and warmly clothed! As a result of such hardship, good faculty members are forced to leave their jobs, which lowers the standards of teachers! This is a very serious problem! Recently, enthusiastic people in society have seen this and have taken various charitable actions to subsidize the lives of teachers, but it is still not widespread enough, and the amounts are too small! On the one hand, we hope that the authorities will make a unified plan and determine a certain amount of funds. At the same time, we hope that society will create an atmosphere in which donating funds to subsidize the lives of faculty members is the greatest glory. (2) is to provide relief to poor students. The burden of studying for students now is so heavy that the cost of elementary school is enough for the university in the past, and the cost of middle school is enough for studying abroad a few years ago! However, the income of ordinary parents below the middle class, especially the vast number of salary earners, is very limited! As a result, they have no choice but to let their children drop out of school with heartache! This is a loss for society and the country! This is also what everyone should not ignore! We hope that the authorities and school authorities at all levels will agree to increase the number of free and reduced-fee places. At the same time, leaders from all walks of life in society should strive to promote the movement to provide relief to poor students. If both approaches are taken simultaneously, it may make a significant contribution to Shanghai's education in the future!

### Imperial Headquarters Announces: Results of Air Raid on Chittagong; 29 Enemy Planes Shot Down

Tokyo, 18th (Domei News Agency) – The Imperial Headquarters announced at 4:00 PM today that the Japanese Air Force stationed in Burma air-raided Chittagong and Feni airfields in India on December 15th and 16th, shooting down and damaging a total of 29 enemy aircraft on the ground, and inflicting heavy damage on military facilities. Of the 29 aircraft, 15 were shot down in combat, 4 were also believed to have been shot down, but this has not been confirmed, and another 10 were burned and completely destroyed on the ground. One Japanese aircraft crashed into enemy positions, and four are missing.

Tokyo, 18th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese Army Air Force is quite active in Burma. In the past five and ten days, it has fiercely bombed Chittagong in India, inflicting great damage on British transport convoys, military facilities, and air forces that were reinforcing the port. On the 15th and 16th, it again massively bombed the Chittagong airfield and docks, as well as the Feni airfield, about 90 kilometers northwest of Chittagong, inflicting fatal blows on the British Air Force bases and air forces in eastern India, which were attempting to disrupt Japanese-occupied territories with guerrilla warfare. The air raid on Chittagong on the 15th was divided into two attacks, in the morning and afternoon. The main facilities of the airfield were almost completely destroyed by the fierce bombing of Japanese aircraft. Many bomb hits occurred at the crossroads of the runway in the airfield, and large fires broke out everywhere. On the afternoon of the 16th, Japanese aircraft once again flew over the Arakan Mountains on the Indo-Burmese border, braving the adverse weather conditions near Chittagong, and bombed the Feni airfield at 11:00 AM. At the time, it was raining near Chittagong, and the dense clouds were less than 1,000 meters high. In addition, more than 20 barrage balloons were swaying in the sky, making the air raid quite difficult. However, the Japanese army finally overcame these obstacles and engaged in fierce air combat with enemy aircraft at low altitudes, and carried out low-altitude bombing, achieving the great results announced by the Imperial Headquarters. This time, the initial bombing of Chittagong, followed by the bombing of the airfield and docks in the area, as well as the Feni airfield, was tantamount to delivering a head-on blow to the enemy forces who were reinforcing their troops in eastern India and attempting to counterattack Burma.

Tokyo, 18th (Central News Agency) – According to sources in military circles here, the Japanese Army Air Force in China had previously detected that the Chongqing-U.S. Air Force was attempting to bomb peaceful areas of China and the Japanese mainland around December 8th, the anniversary of the Greater East Asia War. In order to preemptively strike, they immediately bombed the main airfields of the Chongqing side from the 6th to the 8th of this month, rendering most of them unusable. The Chongqing-U.S. attempt was thus invisibly crushed. It is noted that the Chongqing Air Force and the U.S. Air Force stationed in Chongqing had repeatedly bombed key points and ships in peaceful areas of China since mid-November. By the end of the month, they fled to the rear inland, but around the 4th of this month, they suddenly became active again. The Japanese army was deploying fighter-bomber squadrons to Guilin and other areas, attempting to move, and planning to bomb areas in central and southern China, as well as the Japanese mainland, around the anniversary of the Greater East Asia War on the 8th. The Japanese Army Air Force in China then formed a large formation of fighter-bombers from the 6th to the 8th of this month and continuously and fiercely bombed the main strongholds of the Chongqing-U.S. forces, such as the Guilin, Yushan, Suichuan, Jian'ou, Ganzhou, and Hengzhou airfields, destroying countless airfield facilities and runways on the ground, most of which could not be restored in the short term. The Chongqing-U.S. attempt was thus eliminated, and at the same time, the remaining aircraft also fled to the rear inland. Moreover, their false propaganda that the majority of the Japanese Air Force had been transferred to the South Pacific front, so that the real strength in China was extremely weak, was thus refuted without attack. Now, in summary, the situation of the Japanese Air Force destroying the Chongqing-U.S. Air Force in these three days is as follows: December 6th, (1) A joint formation of Japanese Air Force bombers and fighters attacked Guilin at 0:45 that day, braving fierce anti-aircraft fire and fiercely bombing the airfield runway, rendering it unusable. In addition, several large aircraft parked on the ground were bombed and destroyed. (2) At 11:15 AM on the same day, they also fiercely attacked the Yushan Chongqing airfield, dropping hundreds of bombs, which hit the runway. (3) At 11:20 AM, they air-raided Suichuan, and more than 70 bombs hit the runway. (4) At 3:22 PM, they air-raided the Jian'ou airfield, dropping bombs that all hit the runway. The airfield was rendered unusable. December 7th, (1) At 9:08 AM this morning, they air-raided the Ganzhou airfield, and all the bombs hit the runway, rendering the airfield unusable in the short term. (2) At 1:30 PM, they air-raided the Hengzhou airfield, destroying part of the runway and auxiliary buildings in the airfield, and bombing and destroying two high-altitude machine guns. (3) At 1:30 PM in the afternoon, they air-raided the Jian'ou airfield, destroying a section of the remaining runway. December 8th, (1) At 12:40 PM this day, when the Japanese aircraft arrived at the Guilin airfield, the Chongqing-U.S. forces were still unaware. They fiercely bombed the runway in the airfield and destroyed its anti-aircraft machine gun positions.

### Staff Officer of Japanese Army Air Force Discusses: Current Situation of U.S. Air Force Stationed in Chongqing: It Has Been Crushed by Fierce Bombing by Japanese Air Force; Future Movements Should Still Be Closely Monitored

Tokyo, 18th (Central News Agency) – According to a cable from a certain Japanese military base, a certain staff officer of the Japanese Army Air Force, which crushed the U.S. Air Force base in Chongqing, recently stated that the U.S. Air Force stationed in Chongqing was reorganized from the volunteer team of the Chongqing Air Force, which was constantly trying to do stupid things, and was disbanded and reorganized in July of this year. It is currently commanded by U.S. Major General Chennault and possesses 60 to 80 fighter jets and 25 bombers. To avoid direct combat with our forces, they specialize in guerrilla warfare, so once attacked by our forces, they flee east and west, and have no will to fight. After the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, Britain and the United States repeatedly suffered defeats, so they used the Chongqing side as a base for operations against Japan, attempting to engage in guerrilla warfare against our mainland and peaceful areas, especially delusional about cutting off our transportation and supply lines. However, their propaganda is completely contrary to the facts, and there has been no success to date. On the contrary, their frontline bases, Kunming, Zhanyi, Yushan, Guilin and other airfields have been continuously and fiercely bombed by our air force since December 6th and are now in a state of collapse. However, they continue to reinforce their foolish actions. As of the 10th, their reinforcements of fighters and training aircraft have reached 120 to 130, and their performance is quite excellent. Therefore, our air force must closely monitor the movements of the enemy air force to ensure complete safety.

### Japanese Ambassadors and Consuls General in China Conference Successfully Concludes Yesterday; The Gap Between the Embassy and the Asia Development Board is Completely Eliminated; The Connection Between Various Agencies in China is Closer

(Another Report) The Japanese Ambassador and Consul General Conference in China held in Beijing over the 17th and 18th has successfully concluded. This epoch-making conference under the establishment of the Greater East Asia Ministry and the unification of local agencies is of great significance and worthy of attention. During the two-day conference, the ambassadors and consuls general were in a state of extraordinary tension. The joint meeting between the General Headquarters and the ambassadors and consuls general convened on the afternoon of the 18th also concluded successfully. In summary, the important gains of this conference are roughly as follows: (1) After the establishment of the Greater East Asia Ministry, the local embassy and the Asia Development Board were merged to implement unification. Through this conference, the gap between the two was completely eliminated, and it is predicted that even greater results will be achieved in the future. (2) In the past, North China, Central China, and South China had political, economic, and cultural differences due to natural conditions. Therefore, this conference, which convened ambassadors and consuls general from all over China, allowed the ambassadors and consuls general to frankly exchange opinions with each other, and to establish mutual understanding. At the same time, their common points were also discovered, thereby implementing a comprehensive policy. This point is even more meaningful. (3) The results of various talks between the General Headquarters and the Navy during the second day's meeting made the military officials' views more consistent. At the same time, in order to adapt to various requirements, the advancement of all new policies under implementation will also have a very great effect. This type of cordial talk with local military officials is a first, and we have high expectations. It is anticipated that the results of this conference will make it easier to solve the China problem in the Greater East Asia War, further strengthen the forces promoting the strengthening of the National Government in the previous period, and achieve a high degree of practical efficiency.

Nanjing, 18th (Central News Agency) – Japanese Ambassador to China Shigemitsu issued a statement at his official residence on the afternoon of the 18th regarding the successful conclusion of the All-China Ambassador and Consul General Conference, as follows: The conference on the 17th and 18th has made great progress under the new organization. In the future, the connection between various agencies of the Greater East Asia Ministry in China will be even closer. The Army and Navy authorities also frankly exchanged opinions, and completely passed the process of this conference. The most meaningful aspect is that the opinions of the central authorities of the government have been clearly demonstrated in the instructions of the Greater East Asia Minister and the Foreign Minister. The various agencies of the military, the Greater East Asia Ministry, and the Foreign Ministry have now formed a unified entity to complete various powerful policies. The fundamental policy towards China remains unchanged, and it will be strengthened and promoted more actively. This is what we have long anticipated. The central authorities also specially dispatched senior officials to participate in this conference and personally presided over the convening of ambassadors and consuls general from all over China in one place. This is indeed a major gain in implementing the central policy. Therefore, this conference has enabled the functions of the newly established Greater East Asia Ministry's comprehensive organization to be fully utilized, and there is no doubt that various measures can be strongly promoted under this new organization.

### Japan to Increase Two Transportation Lines to Central China; To be Implemented from January 1st

Stockholm, Central News Agency, 18th - It is rumored here that in light of the development of the war situation, US President Roosevelt intends to issue a major statement within days in order to reform the military and political structure, announcing that he has decided to establish a wartime system before the end of this year. According to a Washington dispatch, US Secretary of War Stimson will resign soon, and his vacancy will be filled by Supreme Court Justice Murphy. However, this has not been officially confirmed.

### German Forces Continue to Advance Between the Volga and Don Rivers; Soviet Forces Suffer Losses South of Toropez; Smolensk Offensive Stalls

German Supreme Headquarters, Swedish News Agency, 18th - This afternoon's German war report stated that Soviet forces launched attacks in the Terek, Stalingrad, and Great Don River Bend areas yesterday, but were all repelled by German forces with heavy losses. It is reported that the Soviet forces lost over 20 tanks. German forces broke through the enemy's strong positions on high ground between the Volga and Don Rivers and continue to advance. Fierce fighting on the Don River is still ongoing. The cooperation between the German-Italian forces and the air force is quite smooth. From December 16th to 17th, a total of 101 enemy tanks were destroyed. The enemy's attack in the central sector was dispersed by German aircraft, and 28 enemy tanks were destroyed. The enemy's local attack in the northern sector was also repelled. In Libya, the German-Italian forces are currently advancing according to plan. There is only reconnaissance activity in Tunisia.

Berlin, Swedish News Agency, 18th - According to sources here, the Soviet army launched an offensive against Smolensk two weeks ago, but the offensive has stalled after the Soviet army was encircled and annihilated south of Toropez. The Soviet army lost 542 tanks, 447 artillery pieces, over 1,000 trucks, 15,000 dead, and 4,200 captured. This shows that the Soviet army used this place as the center of its offensive, and the huge number of artillery and tank losses is clear evidence of the Soviet army's grand plans. Berlin military officials believe that the Soviet army's encirclement and annihilation in Toropez is a major victory in the northern sector of the Eastern Front and will affect the future course of the war. The Soviet army continues to attack in various places on the Eastern Front, but without a pre-planned plan.

Berlin, Swedish News Agency, 18th - Responsible sources claim that a part of the Soviet elite forces was encircled and annihilated by the German army southeast of Toropez. This unit had the latest motorized equipment and artillery and originally planned to break through the German front line south of the area between Rzhev and Toropez, but once it broke in, its rear was cut off by the German army and was eventually surrounded and annihilated by the German army. The heavy rain on the Eastern Front has stopped, and the German air force has intensified its activities again. Yesterday, Soviet aircraft losses reached 60, while the German side lost only 7. In the Valdai Hills near Smolensk, Soviet forces also launched attacks, but their strength was very weak. In the central Don River area and the Stalingrad area, the Soviet offensive has intensified, but there has been no progress, only increasing their losses.

### Rome Evacuates Military Institutions; Naples Evacuates Children

Rome, Swedish News Agency, 18th - A Swedish News Agency reporter learned yesterday from well-informed sources that after Italy joined the war, relevant parties planned to evacuate all government offices in Rome and declare the city a non-defended city. Later, because the enemy also frequently bombed non-defended cities, it was abandoned. However, Italy will continue to abide by legal principles and prepare to evacuate Rome's military institutions.

Rome, Central News Agency, 17th - According to a dispatch from Naples, the local authorities, in order to cope with the indiscriminate bombing by British aircraft, ordered a few days ago to evacuate all children in the city, both male and female, from the age of six to fourteen. As of now, a total of 160,000 children have been evacuated. It is reported that these children are being accommodated in Naples, Palermo, Avellino, Benevento, and other prefectures.

Naples, Swedish News Agency, 18th - The evacuation of residents has begun here. Children aged six to fourteen are being evacuated first. There are approximately 160,000 of these children, while the total population of the city is 850,000.

### Spanish Foreign Minister Departs for Portugal

General Campos, representative of the Spanish military headquarters, and Tafona, Director of the Economic Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and Camposano, Director of the Information Department, accompanied him.

### Hu Zhengzhi Reports on Travels in Gansu and Shaanxi: A Letter; Rural Household Weaving and Sideline Industries Have Collapsed; Maintaining Existing Enterprises is Most Urgent

Mr. Hu Zhengzhi, general manager of the Chongqing Ta Kung Pao, recently participated in the public funeral of Zhang Jiluan and inspected the Northwest before returning to Chongqing. He issued a letter to a friend reporting on the recent situation in the Northwest. Excerpts of the key points are as follows: "I flew from Chongqing to Lanzhou on August 18th, arriving in three hours. I stayed in Lanzhou for eight days. Since it was my first time, everything I saw and heard was new. On August 26th, I was sent to Xi'an in a small car by Mr. He Jingwu, director of the Northwest Highway Bureau. The journey took three days. The products of Gansu, Qinghai, Ningxia, and Mao were abundant, but due to transportation congestion, goods were abandoned on the ground, which is regrettable. I stayed in Xi'an for fourteen days to handle Jiluan's funeral. Although I felt busy and tired, I had the opportunity to contact people from various aspects of Shaanxi, which was also a laborious task. The atmosphere in Shaanxi Province is not as monotonous and open as in Gansu. The customs of the north are deeper, and grassroots politics need to be improved, especially in areas such as police affairs and baojia systems. The atmosphere of depression and confusion among the gentry, merchants, and the public is too strong, and the younger generation is even more bewildered. There are many small organizations of all kinds, and no small amount of legitimate energy is consumed in struggles and friction. Gansu Province does not produce cotton, and the problem of clothing is extremely serious. Poor children often lack complete shirts and pants. I met three or five young poor girls on the highway who were naked from the waist down. There must be more in the villages. I had heard in Gansu that the Northwest relied on Henan homespun for clothing, but recently it has suddenly disappeared. After arriving in Chang'an, I inquired in detail and learned that due to regulations, rural household weaving and sideline industries have collapsed. Looking ahead, I feel that the country is worrying. Industry in Shaanxi Province is more developed than in Gansu. There are still quite a few new-style factories with smoking chimneys in Xianyang and Baoji. However, when I meet with relevant people, they always say that regulations are too strict, transportation is inconvenient, taxes are too heavy, and costs are too high, making it impossible to sustain. They even say that if things continue like this, in another year or two, most of the existing industries will have to close down. What hope is there for new construction? Their suffering and hardship cannot be truly understood by those who are far away and on the outside. Current opinion competes to say that the Northwest should be developed, but in fact, the most urgent problem is how to maintain the Northwest's existing enterprises and organizations. Brother Jiluan, in his dealings with people and affairs, always acted with peace and kindness. His death was also repaid by all parties, public and private, and was truly generous. The scenery of the cemetery is excellent. Shaanxi had been dry for a long time, but on September 4th, there was a sudden heavy rain. The colleagues handling the funeral were worried that the weather might affect the funeral, but the weather was clear on both the 5th and 6th, especially on the 6th. Therefore, no less than 100,000 people participated in the public funeral, and it was extremely sorrowful and honored. The rain resumed the next day, and people all said that Brother Ji had good luck after death."

### To Reduce Potential Encounters: Shanghai Residents Must Be Vigilant; Military Authorities Will Make Every Effort to Eliminate the Possibility of Air Raids; Remarks by the Commissioner General of the Shanghai Municipal Police

The second air raid control exercise is currently underway. In order to further urge the public to pay attention to this, the Commissioner General of the Shanghai Municipal Police made the following remarks yesterday: "If Shanghai residents want to reduce the risk of Shanghai encountering air raids, they must take all precautionary measures to protect themselves and must make every effort to comply with the instructions issued by the authorities. Recalling 1937, when bombs fell on the concessions and lives and property were lost, this is a historical lesson. The people must prevent it from happening again. The cause of this incident in the past was the complete lack of organization and cooperation between public agencies. This is now a thing of the past, because the people of Shanghai are deeply aware of their responsibilities. I am deeply gratified by the mutual understanding and cooperation between the people and the authorities, and I hope that people from all walks of life will work hard to protect themselves, and that they will study all relevant instructions in order to understand them thoroughly."

Shanghai Is Already in a Wartime Situation

The Commissioner General continued: "I personally went to the Broadway Mansions and the roof of the Wing On Company Building on the night of the air raid drill, and the general situation has greatly improved compared to the last time. In the western Hongkou district, the situation in some places was 'extremely bad.' The results in other areas of the International Settlement were completely satisfactory. During an air raid, the public must be absolutely spontaneous, because Shanghai is already in a wartime situation, so air raids are not impossible, but the military authorities will do everything possible to eliminate this possibility."

Thorough Training in Preventive Measures

It is also learned that the purpose of the last air raid drill was only to control lighting. The current situation is very different. All people in the city must be thoroughly trained to deal with the crisis from above. Therefore, the scope of this training is wider, and the public must comply with the orders of the authorities even more. Taking schools as an example, all primary and secondary school students must be taught how to prevent air raids, and suitable shelters and aid stations must also be established. Attention should also be paid to fire extinguishing, putting out incendiary bombs, and rescue work. Baojia personnel and self-defense corps must be responsible for educating the people. The Commissioner General added that Shanghai lacks the yellow sand needed to extinguish ordinary incendiary bombs, but wet clothes are equally effective.

Reduced Crime Depends on Baojia

It is also reported that 450,000 baojia personnel and 170,000 self-defense corps members have proven to have a huge effect on maintaining order and security in the International Settlement, and they have also provided great help to the police department in the work of air raid drills. In 1941, the International Settlement had an average of 120 robbery cases per month, and some citizens were often subjected to terror. From May 1942 to the present, the number has dropped from 120 per month to once or twice per month. It is said that part of the reason is due to the efforts of the baojia and self-defense corps members. The phenomenon of public non-cooperation in Shanghai in 1941 has now changed. Every resident is now happy to enter into a state of harmony.

Continued Control

It is also learned that air raid control is continuing these days, and the city is still in a state of alert. It is hoped that the public will pay attention to the air raid sirens at all times and take appropriate steps. The work of the baojia personnel in each group is still continuing.

### Private Lighting Must Be Strictly Shielded

The French Concession authorities issued a notice to residents to pay attention. In the coming days, there will be several more warning alarms, and street lights will remain open as usual. However, during this alert period, the lights in all private residences, shops, private roads, and alleyways must still be strictly shielded. Everyone is expected to comply respectfully.

### Shanghai West Financial Advisory Committee to Be Established Today

Since the Shanghai Municipal Government and the Shanghai Municipal Council signed the Shanghai West Financial Agreement, the finances of the Shanghai West area have been taken over by the Municipal Government. The Municipal Finance Bureau has established a financial office in the area, and all tax revenues in the area are collected by the office. However, in order to seek the opinions of the residents of the area, a financial advisory committee was organized. There are a total of nine members, four of whom are recommended by the Municipal Council and five of whom are selected by the Municipal Government, all of whom are gentry from Shanghai West. The committee's task is to offer the mayor opinions on financial matters and to be consulted by the mayor. The preparatory work of the committee has been completed and it will be established at the Municipal Government at 3:00 PM this afternoon. The list of members is as follows: Feng Bingnan, Ye Fu, Zhu Boquan, Shen Siliang, Li Hongfei, Seiiichi Miyoshi, Toranosuke Morimoto, Shichitaro Yada, Gregory Ksinos, Piexo Caluna, and nine others. The Municipal Government will also invite Director-General Okazaki and Chief of General Affairs Teraoka of the Municipal Council and heads of relevant Chinese and foreign agencies to participate in the establishment of the committee today.

### Soliciting Donations for Clothing for Impoverished Children

The Shanghai YMCA, in view of the general poor children in Shanghai who are suffering in the streets during the winter season, is very sympathetic. The association has made and distributed winter clothing for poor children over the years, and many have relied on it to survive. This year's city conditions are difficult, even more so than before, and it is expected that there will be more children suffering from the cold than in previous years. Since the launch of fundraising and sewing winter clothing in preparation for distribution, progress has been smooth. Several tens of thousands of dollars have been raised, and warm-hearted people from all walks of life are generously donating. This time, the association has specified a method. Anyone who wants to donate themselves or entrust the association to donate on their behalf is welcome. Mr. Zhao Shiying has been specially assigned to be responsible for this matter. If you have any donations, please send them directly to the YMCA in Baxianqiao. Contact Mr. Zhao for all details.

### Mr. Wen Lanting Recovered and Discharged from Hospital

Mr. Wen Lanting's illness and hospitalization have been of great concern to the public. Reports on his condition and treatment have been published in various newspapers. Mr. Wen has been hospitalized for over two months. His decade-long ailment has vanished, and his joy is beyond words. The reporter not only congratulates Mr. Wen but also celebrates the future of Shanghai society, as Mr. Wen has been dedicated to public welfare for decades, contributing greatly to society. He has been so busy with public affairs that he neglected his illness. Two months ago, due to overwork, his prostatic hypertrophy gradually worsened, leading to urinary retention. Only then did he seek medical treatment. During his hospitalization, all his public welfare affairs were inevitably affected. Now, he has regained his health from ten years ago and was discharged from the hospital yesterday. Currently, social affairs are awaiting Mr. Wen's continued handling with his spirit of being old but vigorous. The details of Mr. Wen's illness and treatment are recorded below, which will be welcomed by those who are concerned.

Condition of Illness

Mr. Wen suffered from senile prostatic hypertrophy for nearly ten years. Ten years ago, he urinated once every night, five years ago two or three times every night, and in the past two years, it increased to five or six times every night. The number of times during the day also increased, with small amounts of urine each time. Recently, urination gradually became difficult, and even impossible. Prostatic hypertrophy is called "strangury" in traditional Chinese medicine, which is generally caused by decreased testicular secretion in the elderly, leading to gradual enlargement of the prostate, causing the urethra and bladder opening to be squeezed, making urination difficult. Mild cases result in weak urination and incomplete emptying, while severe cases result in unsmooth urination, eventually leading to obstruction. If appropriate treatment is not administered, it can be life-threatening. Mr. Wen is seventy-three years old, and in recent years, he has been handling social affairs with unusual intensity, which is closely related to the development of this disease.

Treatment Process

Mr. Wen is the chairman of Shanghai Nanyang Hospital. Since he was unable to urinate and felt severe pain, he went to the hospital for diagnosis and treatment on October 8. He was treated by Dr. Chen Bangdian, the director of the Department of Urology, who immediately performed urinary catheterization. After draining the urine, Mr. Wen was discharged from the hospital to prepare everything. The next day, he was hospitalized for radical treatment. Initially, a catheter was inserted into the urethra to facilitate excretion, and more than ten injections of testicular secretion preparations were administered successively. At the same time, traditional Chinese medicine was tried, but both proved ineffective. After careful discussion by the doctors, it was determined that the treatment of this disease would not be successful without surgery. Therefore, on the morning of October 16, Dr. Chen performed vasoligation under local anesthesia to prevent epididymitis during treatment. After removing the catheter once, a urination test was performed, but it was ineffective. Mr. Wen resolutely decided to follow the advice of the doctors and undergo thorough treatment. Thus, on the morning of the 25th, Dr. Chen Bangdian presided over the prostatectomy with the assistance of Drs. Gao Rimei and Wang Yijing, using spinal anesthesia. After one hour of surgery, 300 cc of blood were transfused, and the recovery was good. On the third and fourth days, there was a slight fever, with the highest temperature being 37.9 degrees Celsius, which soon subsided. Although there was some discomfort afterward, with the careful care of the doctors and nurses, he quickly recovered. The abdominal wound gradually healed. By November 20, he was able to urinate spontaneously through the urethra, and the amount of urine gradually increased, and the time interval gradually lengthened. On December 8, he was able to get out of bed, and on the 11th, he was able to take a walk. On the 18th, he walked out of the hospital.

It is reported that Mr. Wen was very happy in the few days before his recovery. He expressed his deep gratitude to the doctors, nurses, and staff of the hospital. When he was discharged from the hospital, he smiled and said, "I walked into the hospital two months ago. After many surgeries, I am fortunate to have recovered. Today, I can walk out of the hospital, and the smoothness of urination is unprecedented in the past ten years. It is truly unexpected and makes people endlessly happy!" Mr. Wen has extensive social connections. During his hospitalization, hundreds of people visited him every day. Now that he has recovered and been discharged from the hospital, everyone is celebrating. Some say that Mr. Wen is blessed by heaven and has done good deeds throughout his life. Heaven's reward for good people is evident.

Food Problem Discussion (1)
— Li Ran

A practical and effective way to eliminate illegal profits is to use the Baojia system to establish consumer cooperatives. The function of cooperatives is to ensure that essential living materials reach the hands of real consumers under the most economical conditions. Now, if the Baojia system can be used to manage it, its ideal and perfect effectiveness can be further realized. For example, if food problems occur now, this Baojia cooperative can apply to the relevant authorities for a purchase certificate based on the number of people in the district and the amount of shortage, and directly purchase it from the low-priced production area and distribute it according to the population. Before the authorities increase the per capita rice ration, they will surely show sympathy and provide convenience for the Baojia cooperative to purchase the necessary food.

The organizational outline of the Baojia cooperative is briefly outlined as follows: (1) Naming: Shanghai 〇〇 District Baojia Consumer Cooperative General Office or Shanghai 〇〇 District 〇 Union 〇 Bao Consumer Cooperative; (2) Organization: 1. The General Office is composed of district committee members and union Bao chiefs as ex-officio directors, responsible for purchasing daily necessities for households in the district from production areas or producers and distributing them to each cooperative; 2. The branch is based on one Bao as a unit, and the chief and deputy Baojia chiefs are the ex-officio directors of the branch, responsible for purchasing daily necessities for households in the Bao from the General Office and distributing them to households. The quantity is calculated based on the average population; (3) Business: 1. Each consumer must subscribe to 10 yuan of shares as capital for purchasing goods. If the amount is insufficient, the directors are responsible for finding ways to borrow. Consumers take households as a unit and can purchase the goods that should be distributed in the period from the cooperative with cash within a certain period. 2. Branches also trade in cash when purchasing goods from the General Office. 3. The General Office wholesales goods according to the purchase cost plus a hypothetical profit of 10%. The branch sells goods according to the wholesale price plus 20%. 4. The directors and staff in the cooperative are all voluntary positions. 5. The funds of hypothetical profits, except for the compensation of loan interest and the loss of goods, are distributed proportionally according to the consumption amount of the consumer households within a certain period.

The characteristics of the cooperative are that, first, the required items are purchased directly from the production area or producers, which can eliminate the layers of exploitation by middlemen; second, cash transactions can eliminate the risks of operators; third, the amount of profit is distributed to consumers according to the amount of consumption. In this way, no penny of the money spent by consumers is wasted meaninglessly. Now, the cooperative is run by the Baojia organization, and all items are distributed equally according to the population, which can avoid the phenomenon of uneven wealth, and it does not hinder the authorities' per capita ration system.

(II) Leisurely

The Shanghai rice problem should be resolved as soon as possible. I thought of a way, please discuss it.

(1) All trade associations in Shanghai jointly organize a grain purchasing group and request the authorities to approve it as an auxiliary household ration rice agency.

(2) The capital for this grain purchase is guaranteed by various trade associations, and borrowed from various banks at extremely low interest rates.

(3) This auxiliary household rice does not need to set up another agency for sale. It can be sold by the rice shops that sell household rice, and each ticket is allowed to purchase six catties of auxiliary rice (that is, six days of rice per person) or three and a half liters.

(4) If the purchase of rice is less than the above quantity (that is, six catties per ticket) due to special circumstances, flour and major grains can be allocated in moderation.

In short, rationing grain according to the population is originally to prevent hoarding, not to make citizens starve. Now the household rice once every ten days is only four days of food. Citizens get up and think of ways to provide relief. I think the wise and compassionate authorities cannot but allow it.

Eleven factories were returned on the occasion of the first anniversary of the Greater East Asia War, which is a great feeling for the production industry in our country. It is of great help to increase production and suppress commodity prices. It is known that since the first return of Chinese business properties, a total of 39 yarn factories and 34 other factories have been returned, totaling 73 factories. 10 yarn factories and 13 other factories have been released from military management, totaling 23 factories.

With the previous deposit of 2,162 yuan, the total deposit is 2,942 yuan. Furthermore, the Poverty and Illness Relief Association replied and thanked Mr. Taiyuan for donating cotton-padded coats, trousers, and three meal vouchers for distribution to the poor. Furthermore, a letter from Wang Zuxin stated that he has been plagued by illness in recent years. Although he went bankrupt afterward, he is forced by poverty and illness, and his family of eight can only hope that enthusiastic philanthropists will consider their plight and grant them food, medicine, and supplies.

### Supplementary Explanation of Radio Crackdown Measures

Regarding the crackdown measures on wireless radio receivers in the Shanghai area, the authorities have issued detailed announcements. Recently, the Japanese Embassy authorities have added supplementary explanations regarding the implementation details: (1) The declaration places for the first item of the authorities' talk about radio receivers with more than seven tubes are as follows: (A) Japanese (natural persons and legal persons) are the police stations of the consulates general under their jurisdiction; (B) Those who reside in the French Concession other than Japanese (if it is a legal person, it refers to the location of its main office in the French Concession) are the Yokohama Specie Bank at No. 733 Juelaida Road; (C) Others are the Broadcasting Non-Terminal Radio Supervision Office at No. 316 Hartung Building, Nanjing Road; (2) Those who wish to obtain special permission for the banned radio receivers in the fourth item of the talk should apply at the following places: (A) Japanese (natural persons and legal persons) are the police stations of the consulates general under their jurisdiction (B) Those who reside in the Public Concession other than Japanese (if it is a legal person, it refers to the location of its main office in the Public Concession, the same applies below) are the Special High Fourth Section of the Police Headquarters of the Public Works Bureau (Inner); Those who reside in the French Concession are the Police Headquarters of the French Municipal Council; (D) Those who reside in the area under the jurisdiction of the Special Municipal Government are the Police Bureau under the jurisdiction of the Municipal Government; (3) Those who are allowed to hold and use banned radio receivers are limited to those who are necessary for official business. Therefore, it is a principle not to grant permission to individuals. It is hoped that general users will not file application forms to increase the authorities' procedures. It is better to quickly report or modify them. The calculation method of management: (A) The number of vacuum tubes does not only refer to those made of glass, but also includes metal tubes. If ordinary people do not understand this very well, they can go to a specialist modification shop or declaration office to inquire; (B) However, electric sleep, that is, blue, eyeball-shaped lamps, should be removed from the number of vacuum tubes; (C) Radio receivers with more than seven lamps, whether short-wave or medium-wave, must be declared, and attention should be paid to this point; (5) When declaring a banned radio receiver or reporting modification, it is not necessary to bring the machine. However, during the modification process, if it is possible to temporarily stop listening within a certain period, you can contact the designated modification shop and also store the machine in the modification shop. At this time, the modification shop should issue a machine storage certificate; (6) Those who hold banned radio receivers should temporarily keep them as before if they have completed the declaration or reporting modification procedures but have not yet reached the date of purchase or modification. During this period, although they can listen as before, they should understand the purpose of the crackdown and not listen to short-wave broadcasts; (7) If it is difficult to convert short-wave-only radio receivers into medium-wave, the radio station will purchase them. Therefore, the machine should be taken to the designated modification shop or declaration office for contact; (8) All owners of banned radio receivers and ordinary radio receivers (medium-wave radio receivers with six or fewer lamps) who have not yet completed the registration procedures, or who have recently purchased them and have not yet registered, should quickly register in accordance with the second item above;

Mayor Chen's Remarks

Regarding the issue of the deadline for registering prohibited wireless radios, Mayor Chen said that the city has registered about 9,900 wireless radios. Now, in accordance with the regulations of the central government, the registration period is limited. It is hoped that citizens residing in the urban area (including West Shanghai) who have radios must go to the police station under their jurisdiction to complete the registration procedures as soon as possible.

### Oil and Sugar Allocation: Not Worrying About Scarcity But Unevenness

Oil and sugar allocation will soon adopt a system of purchasing with house tax tickets. Before a per capita distribution can be implemented, this seems to be a temporary measure for sales, awaiting a better solution. However, it is feared that only a few landlords will be able to distribute sugar to subtenants with house tax tickets. Although the majority of Chinese people may not feel great difficulty without sugar in their lives, if oil is also purchased with house tax tickets, and landlords still monopolize it as a privilege, the feeling of unfairness, though suppressed, will permeate people's hearts.

Moreover, according to readers' reports, some people are even reselling sugar purchased with house tax tickets at high prices on the black market to those in need, instead of distributing it to subtenants. Even if they don't distribute it to subtenants, one can report to the sugar allocation office. However, firstly, subtenants living in the same room do not want to offend the landlords too much, to avoid future disputes. Secondly, there are also many subtenants who ask the landlords for sugar, leading to scolding and fighting. Thirdly, the sugar allocation office is not comparable to the announcements of the Public Works Department police station. Because of these three reasons, landlords know that subtenants can do nothing about it and choose not to distribute.

Landlords think that they paid for the sugar, obtained it, and then distributed it to subtenants, which is too much of an obligation. They do not consider that subtenants are not getting the sugar for free, but are still paying a fair price. If landlords find it difficult to obtain sugar and dislike advancing money, it is also possible for subtenants to take turns buying it and distributing it fairly. In this way, rights and obligations are equal, and there is nothing to say. If oil is also purchased with house tax tickets, landlords will find it even more difficult to distribute it to subtenants. If they don't distribute it, can they monopolize it like sugar? It seems unreasonable in terms of human relations, and it is not the original intention of the authorities' allocation.

However, oil and sugar retailers favor the more ambiguous the allocation, the better. The best way is to issue a temporary purchase certificate for oil and sugar allocation, based on households. The term "household" refers to both primary and secondary households. If it refers only to primary households, how is it different from purchasing with house tax tickets? The quantity allocated to each household should be determined by the number of people. Some say that this will take time to calculate. Indeed, but for the sake of fair allocation, it is necessary.

However, when the supply is not sufficient and at the beginning of implementation, it may be helpful to make some adjustments. Divide the population of each household into several levels, with three people as a unit, and allocate a certain amount to each unit. The Public Works Department should periodically determine the allocation amount for primary and secondary households based on the supply and demand. Calculate based on the registered population, divide oil and sugar into two certificates. To save printing costs, each paper should divide the months into several grids, and each purchase should cross out one grid. One paper can be used for several months. In this way, although the quantity is small, the allocation is universal and fair, and people's hearts will be at peace. "Not worrying about scarcity but unevenness," is something that those who talk about allocation must pay attention to. If the house tax ticket method is followed, only landlords and retailers will benefit, and the malpractices must be prevented.

### ### New Asia Pharmaceutical Factory Increases Capital

New Asia Pharmaceutical Factory was founded by Xu Guanqun and Zhao Rutiao 17 years ago. Although it has increased capital several times in the middle, its business has been increasing daily, and there is still a need to increase capital. It is reported that the capital will be increased to 30 million Central Reserve Bank notes, and 6 million yuan of the increased capital of 26 million yuan will be issued at a premium. The purpose of this capital increase is to enable those who are interested in investing in stable industries to have the opportunity to participate in the subscription of shares, which not only shows the openness of the business, but also enables general speculative funds to be incorporated into the right track of legitimate investment.

In order to show the openness of its finances, the factory has specially entrusted experts to review and estimate the balance sheet and the actual situation of the property, and it has been audited and certified by Wang Haifan, an accountant. The originals and copies are stored in various banks and companies that subscribe for premium stocks for subscribers to consult at any time. It is reported that the factory's balance sheet is still calculated at the book value at the end of October 31, while the market value is estimated at more than 92 million yuan. If the actual cash received from this capital increase is about 30 million yuan, the total value of its assets is more than 120 million yuan.

The total amount of capital after the factory's capital increase is 30 million yuan, divided into 3 million shares, each with a face value of 10 yuan, and its total asset value is more than 120 million yuan. If the total asset value of more than 120 million yuan is allocated according to 3 million shares, it is predicted that the value of each new share of the factory should be more than 40 yuan. From this perspective, the issue price of 27 yuan 5 jiao per share, including the premium of 17 yuan 5 jiao per share, is still much lower than the actual value. Therefore, the premium shares of New Asia Pharmaceutical Factory are stocks that are worthwhile for investors to subscribe to.

### Anecdotes of Jin Shengtan

— Shi

Named Himself After Confucius: Jin Shengtan, a literary critic of the late Ming and early Qing dynasties, was a humorous and eccentric talent. It is said that he once wrote "A Sacrificial Essay for the Underlings" to ridicule the students of Suzhou, saying, "It's getting late, the sacrifice is over. Suddenly, I heard a noisy quarrel under the west corridor, fighting for the fatted meat, you thin and me fat, fighting for the buns, you big and me small. Yan Hui, a man of virtue and action, smiled slightly when he saw it. Zilu, a good man, was anxious when he saw it. Confucius sighed and said, 'I was also without food in Chen, how many times have I seen starving people.'" He took this meaning and named himself Shengtan, probably to mourn the mediocre scholars.

Did Not Love Money: Shengtan was poor when he was young. Many relatives and friends died, but he hated misers the most in his life. Liao Yan's "Biography of Learning from Shengtan" records that he did not love money, saying, "He had the best relationship with Wang Duanshan. Duanshan was a chivalrous person. One day, he gave Mr. Jin 3,000 gold and said, 'I will use this to generate interest. After I die, it will still belong to me. The interest will help you to study.' Mr. Jin agreed. In less than a month, he had squandered it all. So he said to Duanshan, 'Keeping this thing in your house will only increase your reputation as a miser. I have already discarded it for you!' Duanshan laughed and did not take it seriously!" From this, we can see Shengtan's contempt for money. When he commented on "Water Margin," he said about the love of money, "The reason why people need money is that money can make people look good. People take money as their life, and when they have money, they give it to others. If they want to look good, they don't care about money. But there are people who are addicted to hoarding money and don't want to look good. This is one kind of person."

"Records of the Grand Historian" Is Just an Account Book for Wine and Meat: Shengtan was an eccentric talent. He praised the burning of books by the First Emperor in his discussion of history. In his comments in "Water Margin," he said, "...To destroy the Way and to govern is to make arbitrary judgments. If there are arbitrary judgments, how can the books not be burned? If there are people who make arbitrary judgments, how can they not be punished! Therefore, Qin people burned books, not only because of the will of the First Emperor, but also because of the will of Confucius. It was just that Confucius did not burn books because he had no merit in writing books and no right to burn books. If the First Emperor burned books and also burned the scriptures, then although he had the right, he had no virtue. If he had no reason, then he would burn them all without knowing the reason. Therefore, burning the scriptures is the sin of the First Emperor. Burning the books is the merit of the First Emperor." In his writing, he praised Shi Nai'an, the author of "Water Margin," and regarded him as the only talented scholar in three thousand years. As for Sima Qian's historical language, he regarded it only as an account book for wine and meat, not worthy of being called a peerless masterpiece. As for Han Changli's writings, they were just printed texts, not worth mentioning. He despised Han Yu to the extreme. On the contrary, he praised Shi Nai'an to the extreme.

Beheading Is a Joyful Thing: Shengtan relied on his talent and arrogance and was executed for the temple-crying incident. At the time of his execution, he dictated a couplet to his son: "The lotus seeds are bitter in the heart, and the pears are sour in the belly." "Lotus" is homophonous with "pity," and "pear" is close to "unicorn" in the Wu dialect. He was using things to express the bitterness in his chest. Even so, he sighed at the time of his execution: "Beheading is the most joyful thing. I didn't expect to get it unintentionally!" He can be considered to be able to make a calm statement. Now, after reading the letter he sent to his wife on the day he was abandoned in the market, "Give the letter to the eldest son to see. Eating salt vegetables and soybeans together has the taste of walnuts. If this method is passed on, I will have no regrets." We can know that he was more magnanimous than Ji Kang, who sighed when he made "Guangling San" before his execution.

Refuted Being Lustful but Not Lecherous: In the late Ming and early Qing dynasties, the eight-legged essay was popular, and Shengtan was always a "traitor." Although he also read the "Book of Songs" and Mencius, he was not satisfied with the words of the schoolteacher. For example, the predecessors said that "Guofeng" was lustful but not lecherous, but he believed that "lechery is lust." He said in the general comment of "The Story of the Western Wing": "Remember, stranger! How far is lust from lechery? If you think that it is based on feelings and stops at propriety, it is called lust, and stopping at propriety is called not lecherous, if it is so, then when I first received the "Book of Songs" at the age of ten, the schoolteacher had already explained it. How could I have not heard of it? How could I have forgotten it after hearing it? I cannot understand lust. How must it be, to be called "good sex"? How must it be, to be called "lechery"? How must it be, to be called "almost lechery"? How must it be, to be called "almost lechery"? How must it be, to have light propriety, so as not to be lecherous? How must it be to have light propriety, so that it can not be lecherous and not hinder its lust? If you say that you are lustful but not lecherous, then you must not be lustful. If you say that you are afraid of propriety and dare not be lecherous, then you must not even dare to be lustful." Although his understanding is a strange theory, it actually opened the prelude to modern poetry with love. In "The Story of the Western Wing," he rebuked the Confucian gentlemen who only saw filth and did not see literature everywhere. Reading it today, it is even more enjoyable. It is a pity that his era was different. Although he recognized that the lechery of "Water Margin" was the lust of "Guofeng," and the killing of "Water Margin" was the usurpation of "Spring and Autumn," he was just expressing his own reasons and explaining them on his own. It was inevitable that he would shock the world.

### Sharing the Same Boat Through Storms

— He Jia Zhi

Two Four Six - Backyard Flowers

They had not slept well the night before, and had walked many roads that day, so they went straight to sleep until the sun was three poles high the next day. Wei Cheng woke up first, opened his eyes and looked around the room. The sunlight from outside the window was reflected on the wall, illuminating the room brightly. He looked at Huang Long again, lying sprawled out with his hands and feet exposed outside the quilt. He slowly recalled the situation last night and wished he could visit Old Mrs. Chen again. At this time, Huang Long also woke up, but he couldn't settle down like Wei Cheng. He sprang up and leaned his head on Wei Cheng's bed, laughing: "What time is it?" Wei Cheng said: "It's not early, I don't have a watch." Huang Long squatted on the edge of the bed, made a gesture with both hands, and jumped onto Wei Cheng's bed with a whoosh. Wei shouted: "Don't scare me." Huang Long said: "I'm just trying to see how far I can jump. It's good, I didn't fall to the ground. Wei Cheng, what are you planning? If you want to go home, let's all break up." Wei Cheng said: "What are you talking about? I'm thinking of going to Shanghai."

Huang Long knew that he was not discouraged, and even forgot that he was hungry, so he planned with Wei Cheng on the bed how to proceed. Huang Long never had any concerns. After a few words, he opened the door and asked the innkeeper to bring in washing water and snacks. He also asked the innkeeper for paper, ink, brush and inkstone. Wei Cheng wrote a letter. This letter was for Guo Qi and Guo Fang, the brother and sister. Wei Cheng was to stay in the Wang Shunxing Inn, and Huang Long would make a quick trip to Qingdao. The letter said: "It's been a long time since we met, I miss you very much. Yesterday, I happened to go to Shuangqiao Town with a friend and visited your grandmother. Only then did I learn that your late father had passed away. You brothers and sisters did not even send a mourning announcement to me, I thought you were simply going to forget me. But another news will shock you brothers and sisters: Your grandmother suffered some unexpected feelings and fell ill last night. Now the disease is serious, and it seems that she may not live long.

### Curie's Marriage Proposal (Part 2)

— By Lincoln Schuster, Translated by Gu Xin

One of the Letters of the World's Famous Scientists

I would be happy if you would write to me and confirm that you will be back in October. If you send the letter directly to Sceaux at the following address, it will reach me faster: 13 Rue des Sabloes, Sceaux, Pierre Curie.

Later, Eve Curie asked: "Wouldn't writing these letters add to his fame?"

When Marie returned to the laboratory in Paris in October, Pierre resumed his courtship. Eve Curie wrote: "The same confidence was always in his heart, that she would be his future wife. This confidence was complete, pure, and unmixed with any other thoughts. ... He even sacrificed what others called happiness for his own happiness. In other words, he proposed an arrangement that was purely friendship, and even expressed his willingness to go to Poland with Marie. He became a humble supplicant..." This courtship continued for ten months.

Finally, in July 1895, Marie wrote to a friend:

By the time you receive this letter, your Manya will have changed her name. I am going to marry the man I told you about in Warsaw last year. Of course, I am not happy to stay in Paris, but what can I do? Fate has bound us together deeply, and we dare not think of leaving.

I did not tell you in advance because the decision was not allowed. It was really sudden. I hesitated for a whole year and could not get an answer. Finally, I decided. When you receive this letter, write back to: 42 Rae Lhomand, School of Physics and Chemistry, Mme Currie.

On the day of the wedding, Marie Sklodowska asked a friend who was sending her a wedding dress to give her such a dress: "Practical and dark-colored, so that it can also be worn in the laboratory." Their method of honeymooning was to ride bicycles in the countryside and walk in the woods. They called this "the honeymoon wandering."

The romance between Marie and Pierre Curie ended like this. Their life story would be beautifully summarized by Eve Curie as follows:

She was a woman: she belonged to an oppressed country; she was poor; she was beautiful. A powerful calling made her leave her homeland of Poland and go to Paris to study, where she lived a few years of lonely life. There she met a man of genius like her. She married him; their happiness was perfect. Through unremitting efforts, they discovered a magical atom, radium. This discovery not only produced new science, but also provided mankind with a way to treat a dangerous disease.

Perhaps it is appropriate to repeat Einstein's famous praise here, he said: "Among all famous people, Marie Curie is the only one who has not been harmed by fame."

In 1906, Pierre Curie was crushed to death by a truck on the street, and Madame Curie continued to be a professor in Charpon, teaching where he had taught. In 1921, she visited the United States, and President Harding presented her with a gram of radium on behalf of the women of the United States, which was worth about 120,000 US dollars. She died in 1934, and the cause of the disease was that the radium experiments destroyed her health. (End of this article)
