The household registration in Nanshi has been investigated. There are 86,886 households with a total of 647,411 residents. The household registration survey in West Shanghai has not yet been completed, but it is estimated that there are more than 305,000 people. Therefore, together with the 1,586,002 in the Public Concession and 854,380 in the French Concession, the total population in the four areas of the two Concessions, West Shanghai, and Nanshi reaches 3,392,812. In addition, the household registration survey in Zhabei is also in progress. Although the exact statistics are not yet available, considering that Zhabei has a denser population than Nanshi, the number should be higher than that of the city. Therefore, the total population of Shanghai exceeds four million.

### Japanese Authorities Issue Statement Regarding Terrorist Defense

Following several terrorist incidents in the Public Concession on the 14th of this month, the Japanese Naval Landing Forces immediately sealed off the locations of the incidents and their surrounding areas. A portion of these areas remains sealed off. Yesterday, the Japanese Naval Landing Forces authorities issued another statement, stating: After several terrorist incidents occurred in the Public Concession on the 14th of this month, the Japanese Naval Landing Forces partially sealed off four areas where the incidents occurred, including Henan Road, Avenue Edward VII, Rue Chauchow, and Suzhou Creek. The circumstances have already been announced by the authorities. Subsequently, the authorities paid close attention to the situation in the sealed-off areas. Recently, because the residents of these areas understood the intentions of the authorities and prepared to organize a baojia system to automatically carry out self-defense measures to prevent the recurrence of such terrorist incidents, it is truly cause for celebration. However, based on past experience, although residents in the sealed-off areas temporarily implemented such measures, this organization would disappear imperceptibly once the seal was lifted, leading to the recurrence of similar terrorist incidents. Therefore, this time, the authorities are closely monitoring the implementation of the baojia system and whether it has sustainability before deciding on the issue of opening up the areas. The authorities hope to improve the welfare of the citizens and maintain peace and order, which goes without saying. Even if residents endure temporary hardship, they will gain permanent peace and prosperity. Residents in the sealed-off areas should understand the true intentions of the authorities and establish practical and continuous measures. At the same time, it is hoped that the general public outside the sealed-off areas will also understand the true intentions of the authorities and take similar measures, and cooperate with the authorities to prevent the occurrence of such incidents. The Naval Landing Forces will monitor the future situation in the sealed-off areas and gradually open up areas where self-defense and cooperation measures have been completed. The Naval Landing Forces also stated that the authority to open up the sealed-off areas rests with the Naval Landing Forces. It has been heard that recently, some unscrupulous individuals are demanding money as a condition for opening up the seal. Residents should not only reject such demands but also immediately report them to the Naval Landing Forces for investigation and prosecution. It is hoped that all citizens will cooperate to prevent such incidents.

### Gangsters Meet, Police Attempt Arrest but Fail

### Retailers Purchasing Bureau Rice: Refund Method

Cancellation of the method of using refunds as down payment for next rice purchase.

The Municipal Council announced that when the Bureau sells rice to retailers, refunds for short weight or warehouse fees have been mailed to the merchants with checks from the Bureau's general accounting office. This method will be discontinued from March 1st of this year. From this date, this check will be delivered by the Bureau's Office No. 701 together with the sales order for the rice purchased by the retail merchant. The merchant may only use this check to offset the payment when paying for the newly purchased rice. This means that this check cannot be cashed, but retailers can deduct the amount from the check from the rice payment when purchasing rice from the Bureau. By doing so, retailers do not need to send the short weight refund to the Claims Office, nor do they need to send the sales order of the rice that has been sold to the General Accounting Office. The practice of sending the General Accounting Office check to others can also be avoided. For details, please inquire at the Claims Office of the Bureau's Office No. 703.

### Shanghai Municipal Police Plans Civilian Policing System

Hoping that the public shares police affairs to prevent crimes and plans to recruit new police regardless of nationality.

The English "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury" reported that the new police commissioner of the Shanghai Municipal Police, Watanabe Masami, told reporters yesterday (25th) that the police department is currently drafting a civilian policing system, which will be implemented in the Public Concession soon to eliminate crime. Tokyo has already implemented this type of

### Prevention System

Therefore, residents can walk the streets at night without fear of disturbance. In Shanghai, many crimes occur every day. He hopes that the citizens of Shanghai will cooperate with the police department to make the city a more peaceful place. The details of the civilian police plan are currently being drafted by the police department, and it may be based on the system currently used in Tokyo. All civilians in Tokyo are organized by the authorities, and if there are crimes in the vicinity, they are assigned tasks to deal with them. Another important issue that the police department is considering is the recruitment of new police officers. This matter

### Depends on the Budget

However, if recruitment is implemented, the basis for admission will be the talent and qualifications of the applicants, regardless of their nationality. The recruitment of Americans and British will be on the same basis as the recruitment of Japanese, Chinese, or citizens of neutral countries. Americans and British who serve in the police department, if they accept their new missions and fulfill their responsibilities, their promotion will be as rapid as that of Japanese and Chinese. However, any police officer who dares to engage in misconduct or dereliction of duty will be severely punished without exception. All of this is related to the future. As for the police department this time;

### Major Changes

Initially, only Japanese personnel were promoted. Foreign police officers dismissed in this change will receive their due pensions and severance pay. Those who have not served enough to receive a pension will also be paid a pro-rata amount based on their years of service.

### Car Windows Smashed, Suspected Kidnappers Visit
Youth Heartbroken, Asks Friends for Revenge, Car Owner and Woman Encounter Accident on Outing

At 9 PM the day before yesterday, an incident of smashing car windows occurred at the intersection of White Road and Datong Road. Although the incident was small, it was quite interesting. The cause was a love triangle, and the protagonists involved were children of relatively well-off families. The details are as follows:

### The New Overlooks the Old

Zhang Huanrong, a Cantonese girl, 19 years old, lives at No. 41, Lane 138, Datong Road. Her father, Mr. Zhang, has a prominent position in the cotton yarn industry. She used to have a close relationship with Yao Tingliang (who lives at No. 80, Lane 1081, Jing'an Temple Road). However, recently, Zhang abruptly abandoned Yao and fell in love with Wu Zhenpeng, a Cantonese overseas Chinese (21 years old, who lives at No. 11, Lane 1352, Yuyuan Road). Wu is studying at the police academy and is wealthy, owning a Shunfeng brand car with the number 30270. The two go out and return together every day, neglecting Yao Tingliang. After losing his love, Yao could not help but feel resentful. He and his friends Yan Yongquan and Wei Shangbin waited at the entrance of Zhang's lane every day, preparing to confront Zhang after meeting her and questioning her for abandoning the old for the new.

### Unexpected Encounter

At 9 PM the night before, Yao, Yan, and Zhang were wandering at the entrance of Zhang's lane when they suddenly saw Wu driving car No. 30270 at high speed. Zhang was conspicuously in the car. The three immediately stopped the car. Wu did not know the details of Zhang's previous relationship with Yao. Seeing the three stopping the car, he suspected that they were kidnappers and immediately stopped the car and locked the car door. When stopping the car, the car body folded close to Yan Yongquan's body. Yan suddenly picked up a stone from the ground and threw it at Wu's car, smashing a piece of glass in front of the car worth more than 500 yuan. Wu then shouted loudly,

### Accused of Destruction of Property

Hua Detective Ri Chen Baozhong and Hua Constable No. 2844 arrived and took everyone to the New Jail Police Station. After investigation, they found out the details and took Yan into custody and will be charged with destruction of property. The others were all dismissed. It was found that the above-mentioned people are all students, and their parents are all prominent people. Now they do not study diligently, but actually do such a boring thing, which is a pity. It is hoped that their parents will take good care of them in the future so as not to ruin their future.

### Hong Kong Soccer Players Are Safe

Many soccer players from this city are in Hong Kong. Since the outbreak of the Pacific War, Hong Kong has been the first to bear the brunt, and the safety of Shanghai soccer players in Hong Kong has been of great concern to the people of Shanghai. However, due to the lack of transportation and the disruption of communications, no definite news has been received. On the 23rd of this week, a friend arrived from Hong Kong on a Japanese mail ship and reported the safety of the soccer players in Hong Kong. According to the talk, the soccer players were fortunately safe and healthy in this battle. Only Mr. Lu Zhongyu, a former Shanghai Jiangnan basketball star, was unfortunately hit by a stray bullet and died in the hospital after an unsuccessful operation. He is now temporarily buried in the Hong Kong Cemetery. Lu is the younger brother of Shanghai soccer and basketball stars Lu Zhongen and Lu Zhonghui. He was injured in the liver by a car when he was studying at Shanghai Jiangnan and had an operation to recover. He went to Hong Kong for business last summer and unfortunately suffered this disaster. Mr. Lu's death occurred nearly two months ago, and his family in Shanghai has not yet received the bad news. Xu Ting has gone to Shaoguan. Soccer stars Xu Wenkui and Meng Yiliang went to Chongqing with Mr. Gao Xing, the son of the late Gao Huaide, the chairman of the Shanghai Lidu Sports Association. Chen Fuyu and the star Xu Jingcheng also left Hong Kong in an emergency. It is said that they went to Australia with Mr. Wu Binghao, who was withdrawing from the Shanghai Datong Bank. Wu Binghao did not arrive in Hong Kong and turned to the Philippines. Zhou Qilin went to Rangoon beforehand, and Cai Shengsen and Wu Qixiang and others are living in seclusion in one place and will return to Shanghai as soon as transportation resumes. However, everyone is safe, which is enough to relieve the distant thoughts of the people of Shanghai.

### Tianjin Gang Appeared in Cash, Military Ticket Rise Has Been Calmed

It opened at 13,500 yuan in the early morning, 70 yuan higher. The next opening was 13,550 yuan, with 10 taels sold, bought by a gold shop. Tong Kangyong suddenly came to sell it hard, and Yongfengyu Wanfeng and a bank also came to compete for sale. The Tianjin Gang sold out secretly, but at around 13,400 yuan, it was absorbed by a gold shop. The market was once in a good state, but not for long. Sellers increased, and it fell back by 100 yuan to 13,250 yuan. Sheng Dayong Hefa and a gold shop bought in, and it rose to around 13,300 yuan. Then it tended to fluctuate again. It once rose to 13,370 yuan, and cash shops sold. The closing price at noon was 13,300 yuan, 130 yuan lower than the previous day. The difference today was 300 yuan, and trading was sparse.

### The Need for Ding is Especially Strong, Foreign Stocks Still Show Little Improvement

The grey market for public bonds was stable again yesterday, and buying and selling were peaceful. Transactions also decreased as a result. The trend seemed to be high and then low. Ding bonds were particularly cheap and in high demand, so they were slightly better. The rest were slightly weak. Buyers and sellers seemed to be competing with each other. Initially, Shuntai, Lianyi, and Tongyi bought in, and C bonds fell below the 70 yuan mark again. Later, Dingkang, Tongkang, Yuxing, and Xinhua sold out, and they broke into the 70 yuan mark, competing to buy and sell. It seems that they will not be able to get out of the fluctuation without news stimulation. The market price resulted in the highest and lowest prices, with a difference of only two or three corners. The turnover was about 400,000 yuan. A simple table is listed below. Category Highest Lowest Closing Price Compared to Previous Day

### 300 Yuan a Stone Price, Not Far Apart

Yesterday, the arrival of Guomi was affected by the weather, and the sales in this street continued to be lively. Southern and Northern japonica rice rose again by five or six yuan due to insufficient supply, and the arrival of Yuan rice was limited. The remaining bags sold the day before and the few arrivals before that were raised to 280 yuan due to the hoarding of goods, and the buyers were greedy. However, because the price was suddenly increased by 15 yuan compared to the previous market, the negotiation was not successful. The demand for thick and thin japonica rice was also strong, and the public's expectations were still positive. Yesterday, the opening price of Southern Gang late japonica reached 270 yuan to 268 yuan and a half, and early rice was 268.9 yuan.

### Dutch East Indies Military Spokesman Claims: Javanese Situation Extremely Critical; Dutch Main Force Now Concentrated on Java; Japanese Forces Have Gained Footholds on Three Sides

Batavia, 26th (Havas) – A spokesman for the Dutch East Indies High Command stated last night that since the Japanese forces occupied Bali and Timor, Java has been surrounded and the situation is extremely critical. Therefore, reinforcements are urgently needed. The main Dutch forces are now concentrated on Java, with only a small number of troops stationed on the outer islands.

Saigon, 26th (Haitong) – A spokesman for the Dutch East Indies broadcast to Australia today, stating that Java's position is very important and the situation is quite tense. Radio communications between Java and Australia were temporarily suspended at one point, but the spokesman did not explain the reason.

London, 26th (Reuters) – Dutch sources here stated yesterday that the situation in Java is now very critical. Japanese forces have gained footholds on the northwest and east sides of the island and have occupied several airfields, enough to bomb the Dutch air force bases and the main naval base in Surabaya.

Batavia, 26th (Reuters) – The Dutch East Indies Vice-Governor Mook broadcast last night, saying that the period of withdrawal and automatic destruction is over, and the period of steadfast resistance has begun. Foreign troops originally in the Dutch East Indies have decided to remain and not withdraw, and all countries have decided to continue to send troops here for reinforcement. The outcome depends on people's efforts, and they should bravely exert their power to the world.

Strait of Sunda Threatened

Batavia, 26th (Reuters) – Now that most of southern Sumatra is in the hands of the Japanese army, the Sunda Strait between Sumatra and Java (the normal route from the Indian Ocean to the West Java Sea) is now under direct threat. The Japanese are further increasing the threat to Java's transportation by air raids on Batavia and Surabaya ports. Batavia and Surabaya are now almost daily targets of Japanese aircraft attacks. There is still no news from the Bali battlefield, but it is believed that the fighting on the island is continuing.

Batavia, 26th (Reuters) – The Dutch East Indies Gazette stated that the fighting in southern Celebes is still quite fierce. Japanese forces advancing from Pontianak have occupied Sinjiang in western Borneo. Parts of Bangka Island, the Menggulin area in southern Sumatra, and Tanjung Karang have been largely occupied by the Japanese. A large number of Japanese bombers, escorted by fighters, fiercely attacked Tanjung Priok (Java), causing gasoline piles to catch fire. At the same time, Surabaya was also heavily attacked and suffered minor damage.

Canberra, 26th (Reuters) – The Australian Air Force Gazette stated that Japanese aircraft reconnoitered the Darwin area sky this afternoon, flying very high. No bombs were dropped last night.

Japanese Planes Bomb Aircraft Carrier

Several Japanese naval aircraft, loaded with bombs, crashed into the aircraft carrier with both the planes and the pilots. The ship caught fire after being hit. At that time, the enemy fleet air force and anti-aircraft fire resisted fiercely. The ship was severely damaged and is thought to have sunk, but this has not yet been confirmed. In addition, one enemy warship was severely damaged.

### Japanese Army Spokesman Ohtaira Discusses the War Situation

Tokyo, 26th (Haitong) – Japanese Army spokesman Colonel Ohtaira stated yesterday morning that the loss of Japanese transport ships has not yet exceeded ten, and sixteen were injured, of which six have been repaired. Because the enemy only has 1,500 aircraft and 60 submarines, the lightness of their losses is truly beyond the expectations of the Japanese military headquarters. The slightness of the Japanese losses is due to the good cooperation of the Japanese forces. In the South China Sea campaign, the natives there have not participated in guerrilla warfare. Japanese military currency is deeply welcomed everywhere. Regarding the situation in the Philippines, Colonel Ohtaira said that since the Japanese army occupied Manila, the Japanese offensive has been concentrated on Corregidor Island, so the battle there cannot be concluded immediately. However, all important locations in the Philippines have fallen into the hands of the Japanese army, and we are only waiting for the fall of Corregidor. When the island's food supply is exhausted, the fortress there will inevitably surrender. While all parties are paying attention to the Japanese army's progress in the south, we must not ignore the Japanese troops defending the Manchurian border in climates 40 degrees below freezing. The Japanese pressure on Chongqing has also not been reduced.

At the same time, according to reports in various newspapers here, "an indescribable object was discovered in the sky over Los Angeles." This object traveled approximately 20 miles every 30 minutes, so it is assumed to be a type of small aircraft. Several American aircraft immediately took off to intercept. Some people saw several aircraft in the searchlight beams, but these were American army aircraft. Furthermore, Secretary of the Navy Colonel Knox told reporters in Washington yesterday that the reports he received indicated that this alert was actually a false alarm. There were no aircraft over Los Angeles last night. We conducted a large-scale search and found nothing.

### Hua Weier Discusses Military Talent (6)

Although modern commanders can no longer stand in front of their troops to fight, they can still have a great impact on the morale of their subordinates. Here is a notable example. In the spring of 1917, Murray was defeated twice in Gaza. That summer, Allenby reorganized the Egyptian Expeditionary Force. Australians have never been easily impressed by British generals, but the following record from the Australian official documents proves that Allenby had a very deep impression on them.

"The way Allenby kept in touch with the various regiments and battalions under his command was unusually unprecedented. He would patrol in the hot and dusty barracks, like a strong, fresh, and invigorating breeze. He would suddenly drive to the light cavalry regiment, shake hands with a few officers, and hurriedly inspect them, but he would see at a glance what advantages or disadvantages a certain team's mounts had. After only a few minutes, he would drive away in a cloud of dust. His tall and active figure, his sharp eyes and prominent nose, his concise and powerful words, and his awe-inspiring inviolable demeanor showed his determination, decisiveness, and strictness. In less than a week after taking office, Allenby's impression had penetrated the hearts of every cavalryman and every infantryman."

Should a general speak to his subordinates collectively or individually? I think this is not something everyone is capable of. The so-called talent does not necessarily require eloquent speech, as long as the wording is appropriate and the words are to the point. One must first have full confidence, otherwise, even a single slip of the tongue, a loss of voice, or a loss of composure is enough to undermine one's prestige, and will do more harm than good. I only remember one time when Allenby spoke to a large group of soldiers, and the result was not well-received. Napoleon's maxim says: "Giving a speech before a battle does not inspire the courage of soldiers. The old soldiers are almost deaf, and even if the new soldiers listen, they will forget everything as soon as the firing starts. If talking and speeches are effective, they must be during the course of the battle; they can be used to remove bad impressions, correct erroneous news, maintain the spirit of the army, and comfort the monotonous and lonely garrison."

Individual conversations between generals and soldiers often make them flustered and give irrelevant answers. It is said that Haig has always remained silent during inspections. Later, a staff officer told him that it would be best to talk casually with one or two people to give a better impression to his subordinates. So, on one occasion, he asked a soldier: "Where did you start this war?" The soldier replied: "Reporting to the officer, I did not start this war. I think the German Emperor started it." Once, Allenby was inspecting in the trenches and saw a soldier sitting on the step where he stood when shooting, catching lice on his clothes. He casually said: "Uh, catch them." The soldier bowed his head and replied: "No, sir, no, I only catch them when they run out."

### Cripps Delivers His First Speech After Taking Office; Encourages the British to Continue Fighting; Colonial Policy to Be Announced Soon

London, 25th (Havas) – Sir Stafford Cripps, Leader of the House of Commons, delivered his first speech in the House of Commons since taking office this month, encouraging the British people to continue fighting. It is said, "We are now in a difficult and uneasy transition period, the situation of which is almost unprecedented in British history. But in the coming weeks, or even months, we will still encounter unprecedented difficulties. Therefore, everyone should eliminate personal luxuries and avoid unnecessary consumption. At this time, activities such as dog racing and boxing matches are not allowed by the country. During this critical period, Members of the House of Commons must remain calm and firm, and maintain unity, as an example to the people."

London, 25th (Havas) – When the House of Commons met today, Leader of the House of Commons Sir Stafford Cripps delivered a speech on the Indian issue, saying briefly, "I do not believe that the Indian issue should be discussed under the current circumstances. This matter is too important, and it is not convenient to discuss it at this time. The government authorities are also extremely anxious about this, no different from other people, and deeply know that our country is now encountering this kind of problem, which is extremely dangerous. Therefore, the government is currently taking all possible methods to maintain the unity of India in the face of external threats. I hope that in the near future, the government will be able to submit this important issue for discussion. Regarding the issue of our country's colonial policy, the government has also made a decision. The Colonial Office is currently studying various plans and will be able to announce them soon. Regarding the Indian issue, there are almost two points that can be said. First, whether the Indian army has received sufficient training, and second, whether our country's wartime production has been fully developed. India has a dense population and sufficient manpower, and all kinds of training equipment are complete. The difficulty lies in the item of military supplies. All kinds of supplies must be increased. The government also attaches great importance to the development of Indian industry. However, various labors have not been effective due to the impact of our country's own industrial development. If possible, the government will try to find new measures to accelerate the development of Indian industry. Regarding the Malayan campaign, the government has been criticized by all parties for saying that it should not send troops to the Far East to make a last-minute effort in the hope of saving the situation. This is true, but if the government really did not send troops to reinforce, then the House of Commons would unanimously criticize the government for not trying to protect Britain's most powerful base in the Pacific. In addition, Sir Harris asked about the living conditions of civilians in Hong Kong and Malaya. The government cannot consider the rumors contained in various newspapers to be correct, but it is not convenient to make any comments until complete and reliable information has been obtained."

Beaverbrook's Speech

London, 25th (Havas) – The House of Commons met today to debate the war situation, and was presided over by former Secretary of War Beaverbrook, who expressed his happiness at Prime Minister Churchill's cabinet reshuffle, saying, "The people are all satisfied, and hope that this change of cabinet members will be a prelude to a complete change in British strategy. In terms of the setbacks suffered by the British army in the Far East this time, it has caused the British Empire to lose a large part of its territory and sources of raw materials. British civil servants must bear a heavy responsibility for this, but there is still time to catch up, especially in India. Therefore, I specifically request that the British army should use more dive bombers, and in the future, without sufficient air force protection, the army and navy should not be sent to any battlefield. In my opinion, if the navy and air force can be unified under command, then the kind of regrettable event in which the German fleet safely sailed across the English Channel will not occur." Secondly, the majority of members continued to speak, and all of them focused on the Indian issue as the topic of discussion. For example, Liberal Party member Auckland suggested that the government quickly issue a declaration expressing its approval of allowing India to be independent. Conservative Party member Major General Knox believes that issuing this kind of declaration is very dangerous at this time and will inevitably cause a rebellion among Indian Muslims. At this point, Conservative Party member Weston took the floor and shifted the topic from the Indian issue to general policy, briefly saying that Lord Beaverbrook's departure was due to dissatisfaction with the views of the government authorities. In addition, several members requested that the government intensify its adjustments to the use of the British army, navy, and air force, and immediately take measures to increase wartime production.

London, 25th (Reuters) – U.S. Presidential Representative Harriman delivered his first public speech today at a banquet held by the British National Defence Committee.

This item has already produced a significant effect. I know this sacrifice has already been rewarded. He expressed his deep respect for Beaverbrook's efforts.

The achievements established by your country's Prime Minister are indeed beyond praise. Everything that we admire most about the British people is possessed by Churchill. From our perspective, he represents Britain in the war. He has almost become a figure in mythology. From our perspective, no matter how turbulent the waves are, no matter how rough the road ahead, we see Churchill as a savior.

They believe that in the beautiful world of the future, we will be able to live together with Stalin and the Soviet people.

### China and Iran Will Conclude a Treaty of Friendship

London, 24th – A correspondent for the Daily Telegraph in Ankara reported that Chinese Minister to Turkey Zhang Pengchun left here today for Baghdad to conclude the Sino-Iranian Treaty of Friendship. After the conclusion of the treaty, the two countries will exchange ministers. This news has created a deep impression here. It seems that Zhang has been ordered to carry out the anti-Axis cooperation movement in the Near East initiated by President Chiang and Indian leader Nehru. China seems to be playing a leading role in this diplomatic action and has won the approval of Indian nationalists. If this matter is successful, China will conduct similar talks with various small countries in the East and Near East, including Afghanistan. The importance of this action cannot be underestimated.
