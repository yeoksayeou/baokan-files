### The Imminent Burmese War, Influencing the Entire Pacific Situation: Australian Army Ordered to Adopt Offensive Strategy; Japanese Troops Continue Landing in New Guinea

Rangoon, 11th (Reuters) – “Too little, too late.” These four words can summarize the tragic history of the fall of Rangoon. Too few personnel, too few supplies, and too few fighter and bomber planes, coupled with inadequate defenses and pressure from a strong enemy, made it impossible to cope. By the time reinforcements arrived, it was too late. The "too late" refers to failing to hold the Qian River, then failing to hold the Baolin River area, and ultimately failing to save Rangoon. The battle of Rangoon has now ended, and the battle of Burma is unfolding. The victory or defeat in this battle is tied to the national fortunes of India and China, and is closely related to the overall situation of the Pacific War.

### British Daily War Expenditure Requires Over 14 Million Pounds; Bill for Issuing Public Bonds Passed by the House of Commons

London, 10th (Reuters) – Chancellor of the Exchequer Wood spoke in the House of Commons today, requesting the House to pass a supplementary war expenditure of 250 million pounds. It is said that in the past six weeks, Britain's daily war expenditure has reached 14.5 million pounds, and in the coming weeks, it will increase even more. The war expenditure previously approved is insufficient, and it is necessary to allocate another 250 million pounds. In 1918, Britain passed a war expenditure totaling 2.5 billion pounds. The war ended thereafter, and it was not fully used. After the last World War, Britain's expenditure increased greatly, and our needs continued to increase. Two years ago, Britain's daily expenditure was 5 million pounds, of which 4 million pounds was for military expenditure. Wood continued to discuss the needs for the coming year, requesting Parliament to vote to allocate 1 billion pounds to cover the expenses for the first few months of the new fiscal year. This amount is determined according to the current rate of expenditure and will be exhausted around mid-June. The primary task is to use funds for war expenditure properly. All consumption should be economical, and everything should be based on the country's needs. Any waste must be eliminated. (The crowd cheered) Any government agency or personnel should avoid wasting national funds and abusing materials and manpower that can be used for war. The Chancellor of the Exchequer continued to explain the importance of national savings. It is said that the national savings movement can make the people clearly understand their responsibilities, avoid waste, and reduce consumption to a minimum. This is the most important task, and its significance has become clear with the progress of the war. The key to our financial success or failure lies in this.

London, 10th (Reuters) – The House of Commons unanimously passed two proposals: the continued issuance of 250 million pounds in public bonds for the current fiscal year and the first installment of 1 billion pounds for the new fiscal year starting April 1st. A short debate was held in the House of Commons beforehand. Financial Secretary Crook stated at the end of the debate that the House of Commons spent a total of 174.2 million pounds during the last World War. In this war, if the two proposals of today are included, the expenditure has exceeded the last World War by 300 million pounds. The current interest rate on public bonds is 2.5% or 3%, while it was 5% or 6% during the last World War, so the cost of borrowing is extremely low. The value of this "Warship Week" lies not in raising more public bonds, but in promoting the meaning of savings. "Savings" should be the national motto. The House of Commons then unanimously passed the government's two requests.

### About the Island of Ceylon and its Creation Myth

As naval warfare continues to spread, the ancient Buddhist kingdom of Ceylon is also threatened by the flames of war.

Ceylon is a sacred site for Buddhism, and is appropriately located at the traffic intersection of the Indian Ocean, so it has been famous in the world since very early times. In the first century AD, Pliny the Elder, who sacrificed himself to Mount Vesuvius and Pompeii, mentioned the place in his "Natural History," naming it Taprobane; The Periplus of the Erythraean Sea, also from the same time, called it Palaesimunden (meaning Buddhist Dharma.) In addition, there were other names such as Salika, and Sihalaka, all referring to this island. Starting in the fourth century, the name Serendivi appeared, which is the origin of the later name Ceylon. In China, knowledge about Ceylon also appeared very early. During the Wu Dynasty of Sun Quan, Kang Tai was sent as an envoy to Funan (present-day eastern part of Thailand), and upon his return, he wrote "Funan Customs," in which he mentioned "Sidiaozhou," which according to French scholar Paul Pelliot, is a transliteration of the ancient Ceylon name Sihadiva. This view is probably correct. However, the most common name for Ceylon in ancient China was Shizi Guo (or Lion Country). This name first appeared in Faxian's "Record of Buddhist Kingdoms" from the Jin Dynasty, and Xuanzang's "Records of the Western Regions" named it Senggaluo Guo or Wuyou Guo. The latter name is because King Ashoka promoted Buddhism in this place after Sakyamuni's death. As for Senggaluo Guo and Shizi (Lion) Guo, both are translations of Sihalaka, one being a transliteration and the other being a translation of the meaning.

Regarding the origin of the name Shizi (Lion) Guo, the Great Tang Records on the Western Regions has an interesting myth. It is said that in ancient times, a king from South India hired a princess to marry into a neighboring country. On the way, they suddenly encountered a lion, and the escorting officers and soldiers all fled, abandoning the princess in the carriage. As a result, the princess was taken by the lion into the deep mountains, where she became husband and wife, and they had a son and a daughter. When the son grew up, he was extremely brave and strong. As his intelligence gradually developed, he asked his mother about the reason for his father being a lion and his mother a human. His mother told him the whole story, and then persuaded him to return to his country when his lion father was away. At that time, the king's ancestral sacrifices had been cut off, and he had no choice but to go to the homes of the people and receive supplies to live. When the lion returned to its lair and did not see its wife and children, it was enraged and searched for them in the villages, wreaking havoc. The king could not bear the disturbance and offered a large reward for a brave warrior who could eliminate the lion. The son, driven by hunger and cold, went to apply, ignoring his mother's dissuasion, and went straight to the mountains and forests to find his lion father. When the lion saw its son coming, its anger disappeared immediately, and it became tame and loving. The son stabbed the lion in the abdomen with a knife and killed it. The king was amazed and asked about the reason. He thought that the son had contributed to eliminating the barbarians but had committed the great crime of killing his father. He then rewarded the mother heavily and kept her in the country, and prepared a large ship to exile the children. The son sailed to Ceylon, saw that the local area was rich in treasures, and stayed on the island. Later, his descendants multiplied. Because their ancestor had eliminated the lion, they named the country after the lion. This type of legend often exists among various primitive peoples, such as the Khitan people's connection to dogs and the Turks' connection to wolves. According to modern folklore knowledge, the so-called lions, dogs, and wolves are probably just the totems of those ethnic groups in ancient times.

It is said that Sakyamuni once transformed into Senggaluo and was born on the island, and later passed away there. Therefore, there are many stories about the island of Ceylon in Buddhist books, such as Senggaluo subduing the Rakshasa woman, which is one of the famous stories. As a result, Buddhist relics are found everywhere on the island. For example, the huge Buddhist hall and pagoda of Abhayagiri and the Buddha's footprint on Adam's Peak are all famous historical sites. Although Islam and Brahmanism each have their own explanations for that footprint, Faxian's "Record of Travels" already attributed it to the Buddha. In various Chinese records, it is generally said to be a Buddhist footprint. Only Yingya Shenglan advocates the Islamic legend of Adam's footprint because the author Ma Huan was a Muslim.

Ceylon has been famous for its production of pearls and gemstones since ancient times, so it is also called Baozhu (Ratnadvipa) in Buddhist scriptures. Will this "lion descendant" jewel country be able to escape the baptism of artillery fire this time? I am afraid that only future history can answer this question.

### Australia's Material Resources

Since the unconditional surrender of the Dutch East Indies, the Australian continent has been potentially exposed to a Japanese invasion. The Australian Federal Government has authorized military authorities to destroy roads, highways, railway lines, canals, airfields, docks, and embankments when necessary. This is the so-called "scorched earth strategy." The Allies have placed very high expectations on Australia's human and material resources in this war. Its resources, such as sugar cane, timber, sheep, cattle, fruits, wheat, cheese, and vast amounts of minerals, are constantly supplied to its mother country, Britain, over long distances. "Top image": Australian timber, available everywhere, especially in Western Australia, where the largest trees can grow to 280 feet tall and 24 feet in diameter. "Bottom image": Most of Europe's wool and mutton come from Australia's 140 million sheep. Some sheep can be sheared three times a year. The sheep in this image are just the smallest of the smallest group.

### Germany Greatly Strengthens Defenses in Northern Europe to Prevent British and American Supplies from Reaching Soviet Union; Large-Scale Naval Battle Brewing in North Sea

Stockholm, Swedish Capital, 11th (Havas) – The Swedish newspaper Dagens Nyheter's Berlin dispatch states that the main mission of the German battleships "Tirpitz," "Scharnhorst," and "Gneisenau" is to prevent British and American escorted merchant fleets from reaching the Soviet port of Murmansk.

It is known that the defenses of the Norwegian naval base of Trondheim have been greatly strengthened in recent months, so it can be known that a large-scale naval battle is about to occur in the North Sea. At the same time, German warships will also prevent the Allied forces from invading Norway. German newspapers have repeatedly mentioned the possibility of Norway being invaded.

### Soviet Forces Attack on All Fronts; Italian Aircraft Participate in Combat on the Eastern Front

Berlin, 11th (Kaito) – According to authoritative sources, fierce fighting is taking place in the Donets River Basin, around Taganrog, and around Stalino.

Berlin, 11th (Kaito) – The German High Command announced last night that, under the cover of a large number of aircraft and tanks, the enemy attacked the positions of a certain German division between Lake Ladoga and Volkhov on Monday morning. At one point, the Soviet army launched as many as five attacks, all of which were repelled. Although the Soviet army was able to break through the German line in some places, they were driven out after a German counterattack. The situation in Crimea was relatively quiet on Monday morning, but in the afternoon, the Soviet army attacked the German positions in Sevastopol, but was repelled by the fierce artillery fire of the German infantry artillery. The Soviet counterattack in the Kerch region was also repelled. By evening, there was an artillery battle, and many Soviet artillery positions were destroyed. German aircraft continued to heavily bomb enemy port facilities and positions in Crimea on Monday, with considerable success.

Berlin, 11th (Kaito) – Military experts, supplementing yesterday's German military report, stated that the German army's deep penetration into the enemy's echeloned positions in the middle section of the Eastern Front is a remarkable achievement. These positions are not fixed straight-line positions, but countless irregular fortresses built according to the terrain, so it is very difficult for the enemy to attack, because there is always the danger of being attacked from the side.

Rome, 11th (Kaito) – A communiqué issued here last night stated that Italian air force personnel have been very active on the Eastern Front recently. On Monday, a squadron of Italian fighters encountered a large number of Soviet aircraft. Although the numbers were greatly unequal, they shot down three Soviet aircraft.

### French Misconduct Case: Riom Trial

Riom, 10th (Havas) – The Riom Supreme Court continued its session today. Former Prime Minister Blum of the Popular Front Cabinet spoke, stating that during his term as Prime Minister, French industrial production had in fact increased sharply. The labor legislation formulated by the government was truly "a manifestation of public opinion" and did not hinder national defense. He was only fulfilling his duty as Prime Minister of a republic. It is noted that during the general election held in April 1936, strikes broke out in many places throughout the country, and hundreds of factories were occupied by workers. This shows that the wave of strikes occurred before he took office. "At that time, every citizen, including employers, demanded the immediate implementation of social legislation, and employers did not ask the government to drive the workers occupying the factories out of the factories, nor did the representatives of the employers ask me to use force. Moreover, if I had suppressed the workers by force at that time, a civil war would have inevitably occurred, and the result would have affected military production and made the people favor foreign warfare. Furthermore, in 1936, unemployed workers were all over the country, and most French factories could not allow workers to work more than forty hours a week. In addition, military orders had been handed over to private factories by the former Prime Minister. The most important of these was the order for the Hotchkiss machine guns, which had already been handed over to private factories before I took office. As for the situation of political parties at that time, I suggested to the opposition parties to form a 'nationally united' government composed of all parties and factions. At that time, the international situation was becoming increasingly tense, and the Popular Front government also worked hard to step up military production and placed the free economy under state control, controlled foreign exchange, and increased the working hours of factories manufacturing military equipment from forty hours to forty-five hours per week. It should be noted that before we took these measures, the previous cabinet had even watched some factories related to military production working less than forty hours. At the same time, employers, in view of the large number of unemployed workers, also mostly demanded that working hours not be extended. It can be seen that it was not easy for the Popular Front cabinet to increase working hours to forty-five hours. In short, the labor legislation of 1936 was enough to encourage workers to increase production efficiency. Moreover, in 1936, there were three cabinets in succession, namely Blum, Xu Dang, and the third Dala cabinet. Today, I and Dala are being tried here, but it is a pity that Xu Dang is enjoying himself overseas. In fact, during his tenure, the development of the international situation was very important," he said. Blum finally said that he would also submit a lengthy defense to the court tomorrow.

### Post-War France Implements Rural Revitalization Plan

Havas World News Agency, Vichy Dispatch – Regarding the agricultural situation in post-war France, Marshal Pétain delivered a speech on June 6 of this year, outlining its main points. According to the report, although millions of French farmers were captured on the battlefield, the area of cultivated land nationwide has now increased by one million acres compared to before the war. However, agricultural production cannot meet normal needs, which is still one of the main factors constituting France's poverty today. The phenomenon of insufficient production should not be attributed to the defeat in the war, but rather to the inevitable consequence of the war itself. The result of this war, in addition to ravaging sixty provinces across the country, requires our country to pay materials in accordance with the armistice agreement. In addition, raw materials are extremely scarce, and farmers often have farming machines but lack fuel, and there is a shortage of fertilizer and harvesting equipment, as well as a lack of seeds and livestock feed. In order to remedy the situation, the government has taken various steps to establish "Farmers' Associations" to protect agriculture and rural families, and to prevent their families from being separated. Stabilizing rural life is an urgent task to improve agriculture. The rural revitalization plan currently underway requires a total of 300 billion francs. Since the establishment of the French-German armistice agreement, farmers whose cultivated land has been damaged by the war have been given advances by the government to enable them to continue operating. This advance is limited to 200 billion francs. As for relief for the unemployed, there are many outlets in rural areas. Four thousand unemployed youths have found work in rural areas, and more than 20,000 acres of land have been irrigated. 25,000 acres each of newly reclaimed wasteland and gardens have been opened up. In addition, afforestation and improvement of grazing areas are also being carried out. The government has allocated 150 billion francs for the expenses of these projects. The entire plan will take ten years to complete.

### The Mystery of Reincarnation in the "Indian Spirit"

Anyone who sees the "Indian Certificate" of a Red-headed Ah San will feel a bit of mystery. A face full of curly hair and a beard, thorny rain-like thick eyebrows drooping over round eyes, a large and oily nose, covered with reddish-black granules and warts, and the nostrils are stuffed tightly with two tufts of hair, making it truly unknown how they breathe.

Mystery? Where exactly is the mystery of Ah San? The first of course is the large pile that is coiled on the head all year round, and the second is that pair of drowsy eyes that seem to be dreaming a demonic dream; they are like two dark caves, like unfathomable abysses; the face cannot be seen, it is all hair, a messy mess of hair, which of course makes people feel a bit of awkwardness and mystery; and then there is the occasional murmuring-like moans or dream-talk—said to be chanting Hindu scriptures.

However, these are not enough to represent the mystery of the "Indian spirit".

For example, referring to John Gunther's "Inside Asia", the mysterious things mentioned in India, such as the lock is turned backwards to open it, the railway has three tracks, the hotel does not install doors, nor does it use bells, the person's name, the name is placed first, the surname is second, and everyone's name and surname must put the clan name on it as a public surname; the number of tonnage above one hundred is two digits at a time, such as the writing method of ten million is "1, 00, 00, 000" called one lakh, and so on.

These, in our Chinese view, are not mysterious; there is no need to be surprised or to treat everything as supernatural. In addition, it is rumored that the two hands of Indian Ah San must be assigned different tasks. The right hand is very noble, only the right hand can grab rice and stretch it into the mouth, and the left hand can only do some piecemeal services after going to the toilet, such as using toilet paper. The level of distinction is very strict, even in military situations as urgent as fire, at the moment of imminent disaster, the functions of these two hands cannot be confused.

This is a small matter, nothing surprising. But looking at the big picture, there are indeed some confusing places. For example, anyone who has read some books on the Indian problem will say that India is a poor country, and beggars all over the country, including monks, are everywhere; however, in the 562 native kingdoms that have not been invaded by the British, each native king is so rich that they do not know how much gold, jewelry, and other properties they have. As for the characters, it is easy to count several famous figures, male poet Tagore, female poet Pandita Ramabai, Nehru in the political circles, Jinnah, the leader of Islam, and Mahatma Gandhi weighing 112 pounds. For someone like Gandhi, in the eyes of the British government and public, they just can't do anything about him. He would go to jail himself and refuse to come out. Then he refused to eat and starved himself, starving for ten or twenty days, without caring at all. The British could only succumb to this 73-year-old thin old man and even call him "the contemporary Savior Jesus".

There are some strange things. In the forests by the Ganges River, if we are willing to take a trip, we can see many hermits practicing, meditating on the ground, in thorn bushes, or on branches. They sit all year round and refuse to get up. It is said—perhaps it is a tall tale—that some hermits have been sitting for too many years, and their toenails and fingernails grow like withered vines wrapped around their bodies, knotted together with grass vines, and cannot be pulled apart. Some also have hair and beards that grow tangled with tree branches.

When it comes to religion, there may be some incomprehensible mysteries. There are countless types. Worshipping cows, rats, monkeys, crows, each according to their own kind, is a religion. However, in general, there are only two major religions: Hinduism and Islam. What is considered mysterious is that people of these two religions are often in antagonistic positions with deep-seated animosity. Believers in Hinduism account for 66% of the country, about 239 million people, while Islam only has 77 million, but because Muslims are mostly soldiers and are inherently fierce, conflicts between these two religions are inevitable and affect politics. The country is generally unable to settle down year after year.

One thing that the two religions have in common is that they do not associate with the "lowly" Dravidians. Not only do they not associate, but if the Dravidians are unable to avoid it, and step on the shadows of people of the two religions, or their shadows pass over the bodies of people of the two religions, then their followers will be considered unlucky, and they must solemnly perform a ritual chanting scriptures to remove the bad luck.

There are also some strange things about industry and agriculture. 66% of the country's population is engaged in agriculture, but the production of rice and wheat is always not enough. Fortunately, tea and cotton occupy a very high agricultural production index. The north of the country is a landlord-tenant system, while the south is small peasant owners, farming and eating for themselves; this is not particularly special, but the difference is that the situation of tenants is a bit different from that in our country. The name is tenant, but they are actually just hired workers, and the wages of the hired workers are so small that it is hard to believe. Each season, each day, each worker only gets one dime of silver. However, it is still higher than the wages of factory workers by one-fifth, because factory workers only earn eight cents of silver a day after working for more than ten hours. Isn't it too little? A miner who sells his life, if he gets five dollars a week, that is considered great. Therefore, the British say that in the world, the labor is cheap, and even China is considered too cheap to get any cheaper. But India insists on being so cheap that it is not worth mentioning, isn't it strange?

The reason may be because Indian industry is too backward: there are only two industries in the country, textiles (mostly handmade) and a little steel manufacturing. However, although workers only account for one-tenth of the country's population, the number has reached as many as 35 million. The most peculiar point is that a famous factory has a general foreman who contracts the job of recruiting workers from the factory owner. If you want to work, you have to buy a position from the foreman, the price of which is about one pound ten shillings, equivalent to 20 rupees. Please think, although these 20 rupees are a small amount, isn't it a large sum of money for these poor Ah Sans? What to do? You have to beg the foreman to lend you money. Oh, borrowing money from Indian Ah San is bad luck: many friends in Shanghai may have tasted this taste. Therefore, some Indian workers can't clear the small loan of 20 rupees in their entire lives, because the average interest rate per rupee per month is two and a half annas (each anna is one-sixteenth of a rupee). Calculating like this, the annual interest rate will be 150% (ten times larger than the "add one" interest rate in our country).

Most of the factory owners are British and French. Why don't the British eliminate such bad practices? There is a reason for this. Because it is easier to save trouble and use cheap labor. Therefore, factories can get an annual dividend of 100%, or even 150%.…

However, are these strange situations the "Indian spirit" referred to in this topic? Is it the mystery of reincarnation in the "Indian spirit"? No.

According to Buddhist terms, all living beings in the world are subject to birth and death in the six realms, like the rotation of a wheel, so it is called reincarnation. The six realms are the realm of heaven, the realm of humans, the realm of gods, the realm of ghosts, the realm of animals, and the realm of hell. Among them, the realm of heaven is the happiest, and the realm of hell is the most painful.

Since its inception, India has always been in these six realms, constantly reincarnating. Because of its constant reincarnation, it has forged a kind of Indian spirit. This spirit has been dying and reborn for five thousand years, with the living dying again, reincarnating again and again, but it can never be extinguished.

To understand what the Indian spirit is and why it cannot be extinguished, you must first look at its geographical situation, and then observe its history and society, and you can understand.

Unfolding the map of Asia, you can see that India is second only to China in size, covering more than 1.8 million square miles. Compared with Europe, it can be said that except for the Soviet Union, it is all India. However, the situation is very special, a bit like an inverted triangle. In terms of terrain, the northern part has a naturally created screen—the world's highest Himalayan mountains. This mountain blocks all northerly winds and rains, with a length of 4,500 miles, a width of 400 to more than 600 miles, an average height of about 20,000 feet, and the highest peak is almost 30,000 feet. Even the new type of Flying Fortress in the United States has great difficulty in crossing this barrier.

About four-fifths of the country's land extends into the Indian Ocean, forming a sharp angle. If you want to use warships to attack, it is not easy; because the sides of the lost angle are all straight-cut shapes, and the west side is adjacent to the sea and is all stone cliffs; the east side is swamps and forests, and there are shoals along the coast, and large ships have to anchor quickly six miles away. Can't you use shallow-water wheels, rubber wheels, and amphibious tanks? Wait a minute, even if you can land, there are still the stone walls and swamp forests for defense. Even if you overcome these obstacles, if you want me to fight Ah San, you have to go deep within ten or hundreds of miles before you may encounter a few isolated villages of "lowly people" and three or two monks. Can't fight, right?

### Two Concessions Rice Shops to Sell Corn Tomorrow; Merchants and Residents Applying to Purchase Flour Must Hold House Tickets and Licenses

Datong News Agency reports that all 395 rice shops in the two concessions are scheduled to sell corn tomorrow morning. This corn has been milled by the Shan Li and Company 洋行. From this week on, the rice shops will pick up the corn from the Lihe Warehouse at No. 195 Suzhou Road. The corn has been delivered. When the rice shops sell it tomorrow, each person will be limited to one and a half sheng, selling for 1.7 yuan in national currency.

Flour Applications Require Verification of House Tickets

The Flour Office of the 工部局 issued a notice stating that those applying for flour must hold a 1942 house ticket and license to apply. Otherwise, applications will not be accepted. Regarding the allocation of flour in recent days, the amount supplied to merchants producing flour products is approximately enough for three to five days of use each time.

### Applications for Sealed Assets of French Nationals

### Borrowing Ships to Dredge Silt at the Confluence of the Huangpu River

The浚沛局, in order to prevent the accumulation of silt in the Huangpu River, which caused flooding during the continuous spring rains in April, has dredged the Huangpu River and its two confluences with Suzhou Creek and Xujiahui Hong. The dredging work has been going on for a long time. The 浚浦局 recently borrowed a ship from a certain company in Hong Kong to strengthen its dredging fleet. To date, there are a total of three main dredgers and several auxiliary ships that are constantly active. Because a large amount of silt has accumulated in the Huangpu River from the mouth of the Yangtze River to the downstream, if one section is not dredged, then the dredging work elsewhere will be in vain. The dredging of Xujiahui Hong has a significant impact on reducing flooding in the western district. Before the situation in Shanghai changed, the 浚浦局 paid special attention to the dredging of Xujiahui Hong and Suzhou Creek, in order to jointly form the main silt gathering area at the various confluences along the Huangpu River.

### Garbage Cans Should Be Tightly Covered; Sanitary Regulations of the French Concession Will Be Implemented Strictly

In order to avoid rats serving as a medium for infectious diseases, the French Concession Public Works Bureau hopes that residents in the concession will cooperate with the French Public Works Bureau's rat extermination methods. Therefore, all regulations regarding garbage removal in the sanitary regulations will be strictly implemented. In particular, residents must not ignore the regulation prohibiting the dumping of garbage on the roads. According to the regulations, "Garbage cans should always be kept clean, tightly covered with a lid that is appropriate in size to prevent the intrusion of rats and the breeding of flies, and should be washed frequently with plenty of water and disinfected with quicklime. When the Public Works Bureau sends people to collect garbage, the garbage cans should be sent to the roadside by their owners. If negligence is allowed, resulting in scavengers scattering garbage on the roads, the owners will be responsible. Health inspectors and officers of the French Concession Police Department have all received instructions to strictly enforce the above-mentioned methods.

### Pharmacy Apprentice Steals Medicine after Suspension

Tong Shuen, an apprentice at the Wanguo Pharmacy on Fuzhou Road, was suspended by the pharmacy's 常局 due to poor conduct. Recently, Tong stole the pharmacy's 印章 and fraudulently obtained several dozen boxes of 活立生 from the Xinyi Pharmaceutical Factory. After being discovered, Ren Fengwu, a Chinese detective from the Central Police Department, arrested Tong. Tong confessed that he had stolen ten 打 of 活立生, worth about 8,000 元, while working at the pharmacy, and sold them cheaply to Xu Zhimin, the owner of the Dafeng Western Medicine Store at No. 2, Lane 60, Baike Road. Xu was subsequently apprehended. The management of Wanguo Pharmacy was negligent. 童's theft was discovered only after 童 confessed. The case has now been concluded, and Tong has been sentenced to six months in prison. Although Xu is suspected of serious involvement, he was found not guilty due to 童's protection and failure to prove intentional conduct.

### A Quick Sketch of Proletarian Restaurants
   The Wretched's Eating Place

   The so-called proletarian restaurant is simply another name for a popular restaurant. The word "proletarian" is an abbreviation of the English word "proletariat," just as in literature there are distinctions between proletariat, petty bourgeoisie, and aristocracy. In this city, restaurants stand in great numbers, but open-air food stalls cannot be compared with the grand restaurants, hence the use of the name "proletarian."

   Long Tables Under Big Umbrellas

   Walking along roads such as the Avenue Petain, Route Pellesier, and Route Massenet, one can see rows of long tables set up at the edge of the sidewalk. Whether the weather is good or rainy, there is always a large oilcloth umbrella standing beside the tables. On the long tables, there are disorderly rows of dark, gleaming containers. Because some are wooden, it is not correct to call them all something specific; a huge chopstick holder, capable of holding dozens of pairs of chopsticks. These bamboo chopsticks have lost their original appearance and look as if they have been coated with a thick layer of mold-colored lacquer. Most of the porcelain bowls are chipped, resembling ancient pagodas on desolate mountains. Oil and water drip down from the highest bowl, and the downward-sloping area of the long table, which we might call a basin, is filled with water. Next to it, a large iron pot sends out a strong aroma of rice, attracting those who are already hungry. An empty rickshaw slowly approaches, the driver preparing to take a break and enjoy a quick lunch. At the same time, the young man at the stall, seeing an empty rickshaw passing by, will run up and grab the shafts, forcefully soliciting business. The customer base of these food stalls is very broad, even including men and women waiting for their fate at labor broker shops, who all flock to them to fill their bellies.

   Pickled Vegetables, Yellow Soybeans, White Rice

   In such a simple restaurant, there is actually a menu, though of course, it cannot be compared with those printed by the Wenrui Printing House. However, a wooden frame with a few lines of ink has its own unique charm. In fact, they don't even need a menu, because the contents of each container, such as pickled vegetables, tofu, and yellow soybeans, clearly inform the customers, and the variety is limited and the price is uniform, so regular customers already know what to expect. Most of the patrons in a proletarian restaurant do not "sit properly." Some put their feet up on the bench, others scratch their backs with their left hand while holding chopsticks in their right. Their postures vary greatly, and their shapes are distinct. When eating, they all devour their food like wolves, and their speed is astonishing, which is clear evidence that the more expensive rice becomes, the more the poor eat.

   So Poor, Yet Still Seeking Fun

   The Xi Shi of Huansha Creek probably did not apply for a patent, so her beautiful name is used everywhere. In addition to soup Xi Shi and tofu Xi Shi, the proletarian restaurants are also bound to have a food stall Xi Shi. It is guessed that this is an elegant nickname given by poor and bored youths to a food stall girl with some beauty. Sometimes, when passing by a proletarian restaurant, one sees three or five patrons teasing the girl behind the stove. The girl raises her spatula as if to strike, shouting, "Shameless! So poor, yet still seeking fun?" However, most rickshaw pullers are desperately poor and lack amorous thoughts. If they encounter a beautiful woman calling for a rickshaw, they wipe their mouths and rush to pull the rickshaw. Making a living is the priority, and they cannot afford to worry about the suitability of strenuous exercise after a meal or the appeal of feminine charm.

   He Pulls the Rickshaw, I Sit in It

   There are also wealthy people among the rickshaw pullers. Once, while eating downstairs in a restaurant alley, there were few tables and many people crowded together. My neighbor was a barefoot friend in short clothes. After eating, my bill was two dollars and sixty cents, but his exceeded mine by one-half. At first, I thought he was a dockworker from the Bund who exerted himself too much, so he ate too much. Unexpectedly, he was a rickshaw puller. Walking out the door, I saw him stand between the shafts of a rickshaw, take a flint from under the cushion, and start smoking a cigarette butt stuck in his ear. Because I hesitated at the door, he shouted at me, "Sir, want a ride?" The spring rain was incessant, and the roads were muddy. Not wanting to ruin my cloth-soled cotton shoes, I agreed to six cents. We sat shoulder to shoulder while eating, and afterward, he pulled the rickshaw while I sat high up. It can be seen that although those of us who ride in rickshaws are more comfortable than those who pull them, even those who frequent proletarian restaurants sometimes have extravagant moments.

### Bold Robbers Attempt to Plunder a Westerner's Residence; Scheme Discovered, Arrests Made

Thirty-two-year-old Ji Shilin, a notorious robber residing at No. 8, Lane 614, Route Tenant de la Tour, French Concession, conspired with his accomplices Wang Zhiyi and He Sanliu on the night before last at No. 49, Huabei Apartments, Route Massenet, to rob the property of Lithuanian resident Li Namen at Room C, No. 255, Haig Road Apartments. Yesterday morning at 10:00 AM, Li, armed with a four-inch live-ammunition handgun, along with Wang and He, proceeded to the location. As they were about to conduct the robbery, due to inadequate confinement, a Chinese servant named Lu San managed to slip out of the room and loudly called out for thieves. Wang and He, realizing the situation was unfavorable, immediately fled. Ji was unable to escape in time and was apprehended by the apartment's concierge. Subsequently, Chinese Detective Zhang Hongkui and French Constable No. 179 arrested Li and took him to the police station, confiscating the handgun. They are currently being detained pending investigation.

### Four Robbers Near Zhengjia Wood Bridge Open Fire, Resisting Arrest

Near the intersection of Zhengjia Wood Bridge and Rue Cardinal Mercier in the French Concession, around 8:45 PM last night, four individuals with suspicious appearances were stopped and searched by a patrol team from the French Concession police. In an attempt to preemptively strike, the robbers drew their firearms and opened fire. The constables returned fire, resulting in over ten shots exchanged. Fortunately, no one was killed or injured. The robbers managed to escape into the crowds and disappeared without a trace.

### Cash Prices Surge in Afternoon Trade, Reaching Around 19,000 Yuan

Yesterday, the cash market was sluggish, but as trading resumed, prices initially rose before briefly declining, ultimately rebounding as the 17,000 yuan mark was breached. This recovery was largely due to the return of Japanese military notes to the six-yuan level, prompting large-scale bullish traders to re-emerge. Market sentiment remained strong across the board. Starting in the morning, each tael (ten liang) was driven up in the silver shops, rising 150 yuan from the opening price of 17,600 yuan. The price continued to climb to 17,800 yuan, with the Tongkang, Yongsheng, and Da Yong silver firms, along with Tianjin traders, actively selling. As money changers competed to sell, the price gradually declined by 1,000 yuan, falling below 17,000 yuan, reaching a low of 16,800 yuan. The Sheng Da Yong firm stepped in, and limit-order buyers flooded the market, quickly pushing prices back above 17,000 yuan. The rise in military notes further strengthened confidence. Xieji, Chengji, Datong Securities, and retail investors collectively returned to the market, and sellers hesitated. The bullish momentum continued into noon, pushing prices up to 17,700 yuan. The closing price was 17,600 yuan, a further increase of 150 yuan compared to the closing price of the previous afternoon, and 600 yuan higher than the after-hours price, representing a difference of 1,000 yuan on the day. Trading volume was not strong. In the afternoon, military notes soared, rising to around 19,000 yuan amidst heavy buying. Today is Arbor Day and a holiday. Silver shops, including Da Xin Tonghang, uniformly raised the price of gold ornaments by 50 yuan per tael to 1,800 yuan. Soon after, the price increased to 1,850 yuan, then to 2,000 yuan in the afternoon. (Purchase price reduced by 200 yuan.) Silver was exchanged at a premium of 150 yuan, and the rate was 18 yuan. Black market rates rose to 16 yuan. Silver coins rose to nine yuan each.

Yesterday, the interest rate for overnight loans among the money changers remained at two percent. Discounts and cash rates for remittances and checks remained the same.

Yesterday, foreign exchange rates saw gains for the British and American gold pounds, rising by five yuan each, to 400 yuan and 405 yuan respectively. American dollars rose to 19 yuan, Hong Kong dollars were at three yuan, with large notes reduced by five fen. Military notes rose to 6.60 yuan.

### Government Bonds Show Positive Sentiment, Not Diminished from the Past

The government bond market continued its strong upward trend yesterday, reversing the previous days of sluggishness and significant declines. Absorption by various trading groups continued actively, with some previous sellers returning as buyers. Firms such as Da Zhongjinwei and Tongkang Xiekang were particularly active in covering positions, and Jiufeng Hefeng showed strong buying interest, creating a very positive atmosphere. As financial changes occurred and a peaceful atmosphere returned, even though firms such as Shunli, Dechang, Tongyi, Lianhe, and Hu Heji sold large amounts, they were promptly absorbed by buyers, leading to a strong market advance. The positive sentiment was undiminished from the past, suggesting that the market is unlikely to decline in the near term.

### Cotton Yarn Market Bounces Back After Initial Dip

As the price dropped, buyers returned, pushing it back above the 3,000 yuan mark. However, short sellers remained active, pushing it back down to 2,900 yuan. As soon as the low price appeared, buyers with ample capital aggressively purchased, and the market quickly turned upwards, rising to 3,030 yuan at the close. 42-count Lanfeng closed at 6,850 yuan, fluctuating between 6,710 yuan and 6,650 yuan. 60-count Niutou was at 12,350 yuan, 60-count Caiqiu was at 14,600 yuan, 40-count Riguang was at 6,100 yuan, 32-count Xiantao was at 5,450 yuan, 20-count Yueqin was at 3,670 yuan, 20-count Lanfeng was between 3,750 yuan and 3,900 yuan, 20-count Shuangdiqiu was at 3,280 yuan, 18-count Zhi Nv was at 3,200 yuan, 16-count Fuyan was at 3,150 yuan, 10-count Deli was at 1,700 yuan, factory-produced 16-count Feiji was at 3,150 yuan, 10-count Songhe was at 2,120 yuan, and 16-count Hongkuixing was at 3,130 yuan.

The price of rainproof cloth has continued to rise. The red plate price was 10 yuan per yard, rising to 11 yuan ten days ago, soaring to 11.5 yuan last week, and now reporting an increase to 12.5 yuan. The reasons for the continued increase are:

Rising prices of all goods and increased factory taxes.
Rising raw material costs and increased processing fees.
Difficulties in production and sales due to various environmental factors.
The gradual disappearance of imported raincoat materials.
Rainproof cloth has become popular and well-known, with rapid sales growth.
Only Youzisheng Factory has stock, and Rentai is in the blockade zone. Jin Xiong rainproof cloth dominates Shanghai, causing prices to rise frequently, yet demand still exceeds supply.

### Banana (III) by Gao Jiannong

A type as large as lotus root, six or seven inches long, squarely shaped, slightly sweet, is the lowest quality! Jia Sixie's "Qi Min Yao Shu" and Li Shizhen's "Compendium of Materia Medica" quoted Cao Shuya's "Wu Zhi" saying: "The banana bears fruit, its skin is red as fire – this sentence may be mistaken – its flesh is sweet as honey, four or five pieces can satisfy a person, and the flavor lingers between the teeth, hence the name Gan Jiao (Sweet Banana)." The Song Dynasty person Fan Chengda also recorded its properties and effects in "Gui Hai Yu Heng Zhi": "Jiao Zi, the largest of the bananas... The leaves have roots with fruit, remove the skin and take the flesh, soft and mushy like green persimmon – this green character is also strange! Extremely sweet and cold!... Locals sometimes feed it to small children, saying it is cooling and removes heat. Preserved with plum juice and dried in the sun, pressed flat, the flavor is sweet and sour with a light frost, what the world calls "Banana Jerky"... " Judging from this "Banana Jerky" description, bananas can also be dried and preserved like people making peach preserves, apricot preserves, or "persimmon cakes"; I don't know if this method has been passed down to the present, and I don't know if anyone still makes them this way. Unfortunately, in Shanghai, I have not had the good fortune to taste this unusual flavor!

The Ming Dynasty person Gu Wei of Wu County said in his "Hai Cha Yu Lu": "Hainan bananas bloom and bear fruit year-round, there are two types: one is called 'Ban Jiao' (Board Banana)", large and bland; one is called 'Fo Shou Jiao' (Buddha's Hand Banana) small and sweet; commonly called 'Jiao Zi'...." As for the Fuzhou Fu Zhi, it also says that there are "Xiang Ya Jiao" (Ivory Banana) and "Fo Zhi Jiao" (Buddha's Finger Banana) among the local products; one describes the color of the banana, and one describes the shape of the banana, the names are all very elegant and lovely." From the above cited books, the most common names for bananas in ancient times were "Gan Jiao" or "Jiao Zi"; (To be continued)

### Spring and Autumn Dynamics by Zhou Mo

"Confucius was at leisure, and Zigon entered to attend him, seeing that his face had a worried expression. Zigon did not dare to ask, and went out to tell Yan Hui. Yan Hui then took up the lute and sang. Confucius heard it, and summoned Yan Hui in, asking, 'Why are you so happy?' Yan asked in return, 'Why are you so worried, Master?' Confucius said, 'Speak your mind first.' Yan said, 'I once heard the Master say that he who is happy in Heaven and knows his destiny does not worry, and this is the reason for my joy.' Confucius looked grave for a while and said, 'Are those my words? You only know the happiness of knowing Heaven and destiny without worry, but you do not know the great sorrow in knowing Heaven and destiny; now, if I tell you to cultivate yourself, be content with poverty and prosperity, and know that coming and going are not of your own accord, then that is what you call happiness in Heaven and knowing your destiny without worry. I cultivate poetry and books, correct ritual and music, to govern the world and leave it to future generations, not just to cultivate myself; now the Way is not practiced, there is no saving the world from chaos, and I do not know how to reform it, this is the sorrow of knowing Heaven and destiny; although I have attained it, without joy and without knowledge, that is true joy and true knowledge, therefore there is nothing that is not joyful, nothing that is not known, nothing that is not worried about, nothing that is not done, what is there to abandon in poetry, books, ritual, and music. Yan Hui bowed and said: 'I have also attained it.' He went out and told Zigon. Zigon was confused, returned home and pondered for seven days, without sleeping or eating, until he was emaciated. Yan Hui went to enlighten him, and when he returned to Confucius's school, he chanted and recited books, never ceasing until the end of his life."

The above anecdote is, of course, from a distant past, but Confucius's virtue matches Heaven and Earth and his teachings are the crown of the ages. This spirit of learning should not be ignored. Zigon excelled at trade, but fortunately, Yan Hui did not die young; otherwise, Zigon would not have been educated and would have wasted his life. It is also fortunate that there is still this record in Liezi, otherwise, would Confucius's teaching of not abandoning poetry, books, ritual, and music in times of chaos have been passed down to this day?

The commendable spirit of learning, regardless of location or age, should still be diligent and studious.

The salary for actors in Peking opera is calculated monthly, but one day's absence results in the deduction of one day's salary. The Great Stage has been closed since the New Year. Not only can extras not survive, but even minor actors are finding other ways out, just as a large number of dancers from the Great Eastern Ballroom are developing into the Gaoshiman Xin Xianlin. After yesterday's reopening, the lineup for "Three Gate Street" will likely be rearranged.

The "business" between the Co-Stage and Wang Guixiang cannot be finalized. Recently, they have been holding onto a "little pigtail," namely seven-year-old, eight-year-old, and nine-year-old actors.

The New Stage is preparing a new play, "The Great Hero Gan Fengchi," scheduled to be performed on Saturday evening, with Guo Yukun as Gan Fengchi, Zhao Songqiao as Liu Er, Xiao Yang Yuelou as Xue Cuihua, Wang Jun as Emperor Qianlong, and Liu Wenkui as Xi Qingru. If it is well-received, a sequel will be arranged.

### Idle Talk on Tofu by Weimo

The popular phrases "hatching soybean sprouts" and "eating tofu" are ultimately difficult to reach the hall of elegance. The so-called gentlemen of virtue rarely quote or study them; this is not surprising. In fact, tofu, in the eyes of most people, is too humble and worthless.

Putting green vegetables and tofu together inevitably makes people's mouths taste like clear water, "bland and tasteless," and if one serves it for ten or eight days as the main dish, it may not be uncommon. However, on the other hand, those who "bite the vegetable root" and "eat tofu" always have an advantage in terms of survival, whether materially or spiritually.

In a broad sense, soybean sprouts can also be considered vegetable roots. Eating more soybean sprouts is beneficial and harmless to the body and economy. As for tofu, it can be said to be the "central idea" of vegetarians, the basic team in vegetarian restaurants, indestructible and unaffected by any environmental constraints or changes.

Both soybean sprouts and tofu come from soybeans. The former still has traces of its original form, while the latter is completely different. Putting the two together, there is no way to trace their lineage in terms of "appearance and expression." A small soybean can create two different situations between "hatching" and "pressing." It is not necessary to elaborate on this, but more importantly, its value to mankind is still to study "eating tofu" in a proper way.

Professor Litt of the Lester Institute in Shanghai, in his article "The Benefits of Vegetarianism," studied the nutritional value of various foods made from legumes and praised them highly. He used scientific analysis to answer the true value of these "common" foods.

Soybean sprouts are like tadpole script, and their position should be placed at the beginning of the chapter. According to Litt's research, it is richest in Vitamin C. Therefore, when mandarin oranges are treated like treasures and tomatoes have not yet appeared in large quantities, soybean sprouts are a rare source of Vitamin C, and eating them regularly will definitely be beneficial.

Before making tofu, the first step is to grind soybeans into tofu milk, whose nutritional value is no less than that of cow's milk. At the International League meeting in Java in 1937, the function of tofu milk was described as being almost as white as animal milk, and if it could be combined with an appropriate amount of egg yolk, maltose, and mineral salts, its nutritional value would be even higher. Even babies can be breastfed. Once it passes the dragon gate, its value increases tenfold, that is what is meant by tofu milk.

Tofu embodies all
