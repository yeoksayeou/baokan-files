### The Battle of Stalingrad Enters a Decisive Phase: German Forces Advance on the City in Two Pincers, Another Route Pushes Towards the Black Sea Coast

Berlin, 25th (Allied News Agency) - General Bock's mechanized forces, after crossing the Don River northwest of Stalingrad, have overcome fierce Soviet resistance and are advancing on Stalingrad, a major city on the Volga River producing tanks. Official announcements here remain tight-lipped about the specifics of the battle, but indicate that fierce fighting is taking place in the narrow strip of land between the Don and Volga rivers. The Battle of Stalingrad has entered a decisive phase. German forces are attacking the city in two directions. No new information has been received from the southern route in Kotelnikovo, only that German forces have driven a wedge deep into Soviet positions, and fierce fighting is taking place in that area. As for the German offensive against Soviet Black Sea positions, the German command has not provided detailed reports, only that German forces are rapidly advancing towards the coast, making the situation of Novorossiysk, the base of the Soviet Black Sea Fleet, even more critical.

Hitler's Headquarters, 25th (Haitong News Agency) - Today's German war report stated that Romanian forces have occupied Temryuk, a port at the mouth of the Kuban River. South of the lower reaches of the Kuban River, enemy forces launched several counter-attacks, all of which were repulsed, and the enemy was forced to retreat deep into the mountains. German mountain troops have occupied several key passes in the western Caucasus Mountains. At 11:00 AM on the 21st of this month, a team of mountain troops climbed the highest peak of the Caucasus (Mount Elbrus, 5,661 meters above sea level) and hoisted the German flag. Northwest and south of Stalingrad, despite the Soviets' valiant resistance, German forces continue to advance. 52 Soviet tanks were destroyed. On the Don front, Italian forces engaged in several hand-to-hand combat with the invading enemy, eventually repelling them. German planes bombed Stalingrad day and night, causing fires at several factories and other military facilities. Two transport ships were sunk in the Volga River. Southwest of Kaluga and northwest of Medyn, enemy aircraft attacks failed. In Rzhev, German forces engaged in fierce fighting with enemy infantry and tank formations, destroying 63 Soviet tanks. Southeast of Lake Ilmen and near Leningrad, only localized fighting occurred. Yesterday, German planes attacked the Soviet White Sea port of Arkhangelsk, causing several major fires.

Stockholm, 25th (Havas News Agency) - August 24, 1942, will be one of the most important days in world history. On this day, German forces began a general offensive against the central and vital points of the outer defenses of Stalingrad. For the past 24 hours, German light tanks, field artillery, and infantry units have been continuously crossing the Don River on pontoon bridges or being transported by barges. There are two important crossing points: one at Verkhny Chir, 37 miles northwest of Stalingrad. It is thought that the German forces crossing at the former location have already cut off the railway line connecting Stalingrad to Moscow, as this railway runs parallel to the Don River in several sections. The German offensive against Stalingrad this time still takes the form of a familiar pincer movement. One pincer is at Kachalinskaya in the north, and the other is at Abganerovo in the west. Both locations are the same distance from Stalingrad. The German army has an advantage in both manpower and tanks, and its air force is also very fierce. Fortifications around Stalingrad are being heavily bombed. Fortifications are heavily concentrated along the route from the Don to the Volga River, but the distance between the two rivers is not far, approximately 30 to 38 miles. According to German authorities, the fate of Stalingrad should be decided within this week. German newspapers also record that after the German forces reach the mouth of the Volga River, they will have reached "the natural boundary between Europe and Asia," and it seems that they will not advance any further for the time being.

Stockholm, 25th (Haitong News Agency) - BBC commentator Hale said today, "If we are still unaware of the plight of Soviet forces in the Caucasus and refuse to acknowledge that the German advance towards the Caucasus can be compared to the worst periods in France and Ukraine, then we are all blind. A certain member of the Communist Party's Central Committee warned the Soviet people on the radio that if the Germans conquer the Caucasus, the impact on the Soviet Union will be very significant. During the First World War, all of Europe opposed Germany, but today Germany can exert its full power in the eastern war and possesses the potential of the entire European economy and labor force. Now that German forces are only 40 to 50 miles from Stalingrad, I believe there has been a new, and increasingly worse, change in the Soviet war effort. This new change is enough to increase the difficulties of the war, and I believe the most difficult training period has arrived."

Berlin, 24th (Havas News Agency) - Regarding Brazil's declaration of war against Germany and Italy, the German Foreign Ministry commented that Brazil has become a slave to the United States. From a military point of view, Brazil's participation in the war is not of great significance. From an economic point of view, the country's resources have long been at the disposal of the United States, so there will be no significant increase or decrease in the future. The German government is not surprised by Brazil's decision, because the country's government has been constantly taking actions that violate neutrality under the instigation of the enemy. The people of Brazil will one day demand that those who plunged the country into the vortex of war explain their reasons. As for the Brazilian authorities' claim that five of its ships have been sunk by Axis submarines, it is not true and is merely an excuse.

Stockholm, 25th (Haitong News Agency) - According to a London dispatch from the "Daily News," there is very little news in London about the establishment of a new defense zone by British troops in Iran and Iraq, and the appointment of General Wilson as commander-in-chief of the zone. The development of this matter may be decided by the Moscow Conference, which is part of a joint British-Soviet strategy in the Caucasus. It is also rumored that former commander-in-chief of the Egyptian front, Auchinleck, will take an important position in the defense zone. It is almost certain that British troops will be sent to fight in the Caucasus, as the Soviets need war materials, not soldiers, so the Soviet Union has rejected the British suggestion. It seems possible that British forces will be responsible for supplying Soviet troops in the Caucasus. Therefore, the demarcation line between the British and Soviet armies will move north from south of Tehran. London has doubts about whether British troops will be able to carry out their responsibilities. London is also rumored to have landed US troops in Persian ports.

### From Lecturing to Imprisonment (7)

— Tie Ming

The next day, before dawn, we were on our way again. I still refused to sit in the front, but the back was much better arranged, so the jolting was not too severe. About fifty kilometers past Poligny, in a very desolate place, I got out of the car. I continued to make up a story, saying that I planned to walk through the Saint-Georges Gorge (Col de St. Georges) into Switzerland, which was about a day's journey. We then said goodbye, wished each other well, and parted ways. But my actual route was exactly the opposite of what I said, winding along small paths towards central France.

As I walked, I pondered the situation. The Maintenance Society must have thought that Martin had told me all the secrets of seawater alchemy, including the method of making gold mediums. At least I knew the general outline of the matter and was qualified to be silenced. If the Viyende Men's bomb had arrived five minutes later, perhaps I would have understood whether they still wanted to manufacture gold in large quantities, or whether they only wanted to prevent others from using this method to compete with them in the gold mining industry. I thought the second explanation seemed more plausible, because even if they wanted to produce gold in large quantities, the result would inevitably be the same as with Lee Gam, and it would be difficult to keep the secret for long. They probably only wanted to murder me and then hope that no one else would know about the method of seawater alchemy. Based on this idea, I decided to publish the entire experience, letting them know that I did not fully understand the method, so there was no need to bother murdering me. And to avoid suspicion, I would never buy real estate near the sea in the future, nor would I go to the beach for summer vacation again.

I am now publishing the details of this experience in common Chinese and English publications. Publishing it in England will allow the Maintenance Society's ears and eyes to see it early; publishing it in China will allow my family and friends to know my situation, quickly alerting the embassies abroad to pay attention and provide me with necessary rescue. Most readers will, of course, regard my account as a novel, but if I am killed in Europe or falsely accused like Ge Lehua, then the people of the world—especially those in academic circles—will understand that everything I have described is true, and that I am a victim who has sacrificed for science.

The Maintenance Society and the French police are probably tracking me. The French border and the Anglo-French transportation lines must be under close surveillance, and Oxford University is probably no exception. But no matter how clever they are, they would never imagine that I would publish the most important scientific invention of the twentieth century in common publications. This true account was written in Anvergne, an ancient small town. At the same time, I tried my best to change my appearance. I had already sent my passport to Mr. Zhang to keep it for me. I also exchanged my small handbag for a travel canvas backpack on the road. For the past few days, my beard has grown very long, not only making it difficult for people to recognize me, but I also sold my razor for fifteen francs.

The money on hand is decreasing day by day, but I can't ask the British side or Mr. Zhang to send me money, because it is necessary to prove my name when receiving the money, and this is the most dangerous thing at the moment. Now I must save as much as possible and still find ways to earn some money. One day, a car "broke down" on the highway. I helped the traveler carry a small box to a nearby village and earned five francs. Without money, it is impossible to live in France, so I must find a way!

Before this account is published, there is always a risk to my life. The day before yesterday, I saw someone following me. I ran desperately over a small hill to escape. I don't believe the Maintenance Society could have so many henchmen, and that person's staring at me was perhaps because he was surprised by my strange appearance and untidy clothes. But I would rather be overly cautious and dare not take it lightly.

My plan is to send out this text and then go to Ambert to spend my last thirty francs on getting completely drunk. The local police will definitely invite me into the local prison. This method is very agreeable to me, because prison is the only place in France where you can live without spending money, and you can also get complete safety, without having to worry about the Maintenance Society's conspiracy. I don't necessarily like French prison life, and detention is particularly difficult, but it is much better than following in Martin's footsteps. I plan to claim Dutch nationality and call myself Koning. Since I have no Dutch passport and am penniless, and only know a few sentences of Dutch, I don't think the nearby Dutch consul would be willing to take me in. Then I can wait calmly in the unnoticed Ambert local prison for the publication of this text and for the embassy or Mr. Zhang to come and rescue me from prison with my passport and money. I hope the printing house will not be afraid of the trouble of typesetting foreign words. The foreign names of people and places noted here are extremely useful for rescuing me in the future. Lives are at stake, so please do not delete or misspell them! If, by that time, no prisoner claiming to be Koning and with a long beard can be found in the Ambert local prison, then it would be that I did not even have time to implement my plan and had already met the same fate as Martin, Lee Gam, and Ge Lehua before obtaining the protection of the prison.

What will be the result after this account is published? I guess the Maintenance Society will understand that if I could make gold mediums, I would never reveal the secret so completely. If they kill me, it would be tantamount to admitting their guilt in murdering Martin, Lee Gam, and Ge Lehua. I don't think they would be so foolish! They must only hope that readers do not believe my account, and that those who do not know me will regard it as a novel; and those who know me may think it is a professor's trick to excuse himself after getting drunk and imprisoned in France! But in this vast world, there must be some insightful people who know the scientific value of my report. In a few years, someone will definitely use Ge Lehua's method to make gold somewhere, and those bad guys who murdered us may also realize that it is futile and reactionary to prevent the progress of science. Five or six mathematicians and physicists with considerable attainments, working together, should not find it difficult to calculate all the equations necessary for making gold mediums within four or five years. Therefore, in six or seven years, I want to advise my wealthy relatives and friends to quickly sell all their government bonds and gold mining stocks and buy stocks in other enterprises instead. But the Soviet Union has many good mathematicians, and if they start to study this method, they will not have less than 500 million rubles a year to use for the expenses of the world revolution. If that is the case, buying any stock may not be of any use. (The end of the whole article)

### Responsible Parties Fully Mobilized for Patrol, Blackout Drill Last Night, Aircraft Surveyed and Circled Several Times, Street Lights All Extinguished Around 9 PM

Last night's first blackout drill lasted for four hours, from 7:30 PM to 11:30 PM. Prior to the drill, the authorities of the two concessions temporarily posted notices, instructing citizens to completely cover indoor lights during the drill, so that they could not be seen from outside. Therefore, as soon as the drill began, the responsible parties patrolled the streets, and the situation was very tense. Vehicles on the street dimmed their lights or partially covered them with black cloth. Shops either closed early or turned off all advertising lights. Trams were covered with louvers, and all lights were turned off once they entered the depot. Therefore, the streets were half dark. After 9 PM, aircraft rumbled at a higher altitude, and many people looked up to watch. In addition, senior officials from the police departments of the two concessions, fire brigade personnel, and cadres from the health and public works departments all went out to inspect or conduct fire-fighting and rescue drills. At the same time, the newly established health committee of the Baojia Committee also set out to carry out rescue work. In yesterday's drill program, there were no obvious signs in the first hour because it was not dark. After 8 and 9 PM, the whole city seemed to be immersed in a serious atmosphere of air defense. Around 9:30, all the street lights were turned off, and the lights of thousands of homes were controlled. At 11 PM, the Greater East Asia Radio announced the end of the drill. The first blackout in this city ended.

Aircraft Drop Warning Signals

In addition, during the blackout drill last night, aircraft hovered and looked down, dropping signals on places that did not comply with the covering of lights. Areas such as Hongkou and West Shanghai were warned. As for the results of the drill, it remains to be announced.

Fire Occurs During Drill

At 8:26 last night, during the blackout drill in this city, a building in Lane 318, Wuchang Road, Hongkou, suddenly caught fire. Dense smoke spread immediately, and the fire blazed. The fire brigade drove to the scene to put out the fire. After about an hour and a half, the fire was extinguished. As a result, buildings at Nos. 121, 123, 125, and 127 were destroyed.

### How I Directed "Ruo Lan's Complaint"

— Lin Feng An

The story of Ruo Lan's Complaint is entirely based on Su Hui's palindromic brocade poem. Four years ago, I broadcasted it on the radio and also compiled the palindromic poem into a book on marital philosophy. Perhaps my fellow Cantonese compatriots have not forgotten it.

My motivation for writing this play stems from Su Hui's character and learning, which are truly moving. The so-called "approaching the end with uprightness, even in the face of frost and trembling leaves," those who lack this kind of character and thought will inevitably fail in society. In the play Ruo Lan's Complaint, the first act exposes Su Hui's shortcomings: in a nutshell, "impatience and jealousy." Originally, this kind of flaw is a common ailment among women throughout history and across cultures, and it is not unique to Su Hui. Especially in feudal China, it was simply commonplace. However, Su Hui unfortunately represents the typical woman! Therefore, in the first act, when discovering the location where Dou Tao was hiding his mistress, the atmosphere was emphasized.

As for the introduction of Zhao Yangtai's identity, it also creates a relief-like impression in the poetic and artistic atmosphere of the first act, reflecting Su Ruolan's character and status.

Dou Tao was indeed a romantic scholar, although his achievements are not as grand as Sun Kejian's, but just looking at the four sentences in Wu Zetian's biography of Su Hui, "elegant in spirit, well-versed in the classics and history, especially skilled in literature and martial arts, highly regarded for his discussions," one can know what kind of person he was. With such an outstanding and capable figure, he naturally deserves the title of a romantic scholar. Therefore, in the first act, I also briefly sketched the outline of the above four sentences. However, greed for wealth and a desire for quick success were also his lifelong shortcomings. The smile after receiving the imperial decree of "the General of Pacifying the South," however, subtly conveys Dou Tao's thoughts.

After the story unfolds, the greatest climax is naturally the "palindromic brocade poem," the thematic material. However, the original poem is profound and mysterious, and its syntax and meaning are scattered and misplaced. It is a purely literary work, and it must be popularized without losing the true meaning of the material. The handling of the dream scene in the third act and the introduction of the rotating sphere diagram are written according to the above method. With the climax of the second act, the fourth act is even more difficult to write, because the tragic atmosphere of the story in the historical theme material of the fourth act is almost impossible to find.

As for the directing, there were also many difficulties, but fortunately the results were finally overcome. Because this time I hope to realize my ideal of "improving Cantonese opera and dialect drama" for more than ten years, this time the integration of song and dance drama, Cantonese opera, and Qinghua in one furnace is indeed a bold attempt.

Finally, I must explain to everyone that the main purpose of this play is to guide the great way of marital life, hoping to achieve the effect of "joy without licentiousness, sorrow without injury." As for whether it is successful or not, I dare not boast here, and sincerely ask everyone for criticism and guidance, which would be greatly appreciated.

### Xiao Feng and Zhong Ma - Wedding Rescheduled

— Shadow

The engagement of stage artists Xiao Feng and Zhong Ma has been for a long time. The former is a high-achieving student in the English Department of Guanghua University; the latter is a Bachelor of Laws from Soochow University. Both are very enthusiastic about theatrical arts. The two have similar interests, and the groom and bride are both talented and beautiful. They are truly a match made in heaven. The wedding ceremony was originally scheduled to be held on the Double Tenth Festival in the middle of this month, but because both the International and Jinmen halls were already booked, they would rather choose an auspicious day, but will still borrow the site to get married.

### A Record of the Charity Rehearsal of the China National Opera School

— Xing Yan

The China Opera School has only been established for eight months. The other day I went to the Golden Theater to watch the first day of rehearsals. There were a total of six excerpts: Great Blessing, Caoqiao Pass, Hanging Turtle, Zhaoguan, Money Tree (i.e., Zhang Si Jie Descending to Earth), and Fourth Son Visiting His Mother. The weather was hot that evening, but the audience was twelve times full. The upstairs and downstairs benches were all full. The scene can be described as unprecedented. Children performing is very different from adults. Adults only focus on the protagonist in each play, while small opera troupes have wonderful performances by everyone. Even a supernumerary or an impersonator (i.e., those who play pigs, sheep, etc.) is spirited and dare not slack off. Just the four words "neat and solemn" are enough to satisfy the audience, and the children's liveliness and innocence and the greatness of the scene are unified, which is especially inspiring. For example, in the play Great Blessing, if it were performed by adults, it would not have much meaning, but the China Opera School added more than 20 cloud children who ran with the clouds and seized the championship, which made it very lively. The large mask in Caoqiao Pass, the old woman in Hanging Turtle, and the old man in Zhaoguan are all extremely talented, and the tunes are all above the main palace. The voice is broad and bright, which is especially rare and very promising in the future. The martial woman in Money Tree is extremely skilled with the knives, and the appearance is also beautiful. Although there was a slip in one place during the fight, it was in an unimportant place. However, the extremely dangerous and difficult moves such as throwing the whip, changing the double guns, and kicking the flower gun with the reversed feet were extremely stable. The audience applauded thunderously. It is truly admirable that a 13- or 14-year-old girl has such skill. The finale, Visiting Mother, has a uniform distribution, and the costumes are brand new, which is very spectacular. Before the public performance, the school can be charitable and undertake this righteous act in such a hot summer, which is enough to prove the enthusiasm of the school's teachers and students for social causes.

(Editor's Note) On the third night of the charity rehearsal of the China National Opera School, I was invited by a friend to visit and saw that Mulian Saving His Mother and Catching and Releasing Cao had already been performed. Then the plays Fan Jiangguan, Second Entry to the Palace, and Yang Paifeng were performed. The scenes were magnificent, and the sound and appearance were beautiful. The students are at their childhood, the older ones are thirteen or fourteen years old, and the younger ones are eight or nine years old, but the performance is meticulous and logical. Whether singing, acting, speaking, or doing, all are quite skilled. The audience praised and applauded. With eight months of training, they have achieved such results, which shows the hard work of teaching and is truly commendable.

### Advice to Those Planning to Stage "Begonia"

— Shi Mingyang

When "Begonia" was being serialized in this newspaper, I had already read it once. After the separate edition was published, I read it carefully twice more. Judging the novel as a novel, it is indeed a rare work in recent years. Although there are also warlords, actors, and concubines in the middle, the structure is very special, and the consciousness and technique are much better than novels written on the same subject. Especially the ending after the revision, there is endless wonderfulness to savor.

Now I hear that China United Film Company has decided to put it on the screen, directed and written by Ma Xuwibang. At the same time, the news of staging a stage play is also very loud. It is said that a certain director is indeed interested in trying it, but only because the two male protagonists in the book—Begonia and Zhao Yukun—are not easy to find suitable actors for, and fearing failure, so it has not been decided yet.

This is really the biggest difficulty in staging the book "Begonia". On the screen, perhaps a clever method can be found to solve it, but on the stage it becomes a big problem. Because Begonia is the protagonist of the whole book, if he performs well, the whole play will be full of life, if he performs poorly, the whole play may fail due to personal failure. In the Shanghai theater scene, there are far fewer excellent male actors than female actors, especially like Begonia's personality (persevering and resolute), it is even more difficult to do well. For example, Shi Hui and Huang Zongjiang, both have very refined acting skills. Letting them play Begonia, they will definitely be successful after the disfigurement, but in order to increase the atmosphere of tragedy, the undisfigured Begonia must appear as a beautiful young man, and with the attitude of a famous Dan actor, which is not very suitable for Huang and Shi. Moreover, a role like Zhao Yukun who is so bloody, righteous, and yet very humorous and lively is also not easy to find a suitable person for.

As for the adaptation of the script, it is really not an easy task. This kind of long masterpiece that focuses on psychological description is very easy to make the screenwriter fail. The famous work of Russia, "Les Misérables," performed on the screen is far less wonderful than the original book, which is a real example. Therefore, before starting the adaptation, the screenwriter must at least carefully consider it and solicit more opinions from readers, so as not to waste a lot of effort.

I am very willing to see this play, and I firmly believe that if the script is well written and the actors are properly assigned, this play is bound to succeed.

### The Future of Xue Youqin: Remarry or Remain Chaste?

— Xiepu Guest

I remember when Xue Youqin performed at the Great Toad Stage, I went to see her perform Lady Mi in "Changban Slope" and Consort Yu in "Farewell My Concubine", as well as Lian Jinfeng, etc. Xue Niang's performance was meticulous and delicate, and she won the praise of many music lovers. After Qiu Bin Gao Lansheng left last autumn, she stopped performing on the red carpet and followed her husband to rent a house in Betty Alo Road, Betty Fang, with more joy than painting eyebrows. According to Xue Niang, she was Gao Jun's third little star and was very much loved by Gao. However, flowers do not always bloom well, and the moon waxes and wanes easily. Gao suddenly suffered from damp and cold typhoid fever and fell ill in the Sino-Western Nursing Home on Pushi Road on the eighth of last month. Although he was treated by famous Chinese and Western doctors, he was still unable to recover from his illness and finally passed away. Because Mr. Gao was usually chivalrous and generous, and cared for orphans and the poor, all his students and old friends were crying. When the gentleman passed away, Mrs. Gao was overwhelmed with grief, and Xue Niang sobbed even more, unable to speak, tears sparkling, like pear blossoms in the rain. From then on, the separated birds and separated swans felt endless sadness! After Mr. Gao's death, I don't know what her future will be like? Whether she will remain chaste or remarry is what music lovers are eager to know. According to my speculation from the facts, I believe that Xue Niang will definitely not play the old tune again during the mourning period.

### Riding the Storm Together

— He Jia Zhi

(8) What to Do?

Because of Cui Zhen's disappearance, and because the robbers did not care about the property, Wei Cheng thought of Fei Changhe. He stood in the courtyard, his hands tied behind his back, took two steps forward, then took a step back, and suddenly slapped his palm on his thigh and said: "It must be him, it must be him!" Magpie, seeing little strange, hurried to report to Second Madam Ye, saying: "The young master is talking to himself." Second Madam Ye walked to the courtyard and saw that Wei Cheng had already walked out of the gate, so she called out: "Wei Cheng, where are you going?" Wei Cheng stopped and whispered a few words in Second Madam Ye's ear. Second Madam Ye said: "It shouldn't be, Fei Changhe, we have not treated him wrongly, he would not do this. Cui Zhen has not treated him wrongly either, he would not do this to Cui Zhen." Wei Cheng said: "I want to go to Fei Changhe's house unexpectedly to take a look. If he is the one who kidnapped Cui Zhen, I will grab his chest regardless of right or wrong, nearby, in the countryside, far away, in the city, anywhere is fine." Second Madam Ye quickly stopped Wei Cheng and called Ah Xing to close the bamboo fence gate from a distance, and then said to Wei Cheng: "My courage has been frightened smaller and smaller by you several times. Fei Changhe's house is a door of right and wrong. This kind of person is born a rogue, a gambler, how can you go to his house? Now, wherever you want to go, you can let Ah Xing go, He Zixing go. Just don't you go."

Wei Cheng was stopped back into the house by Second Madam Ye, and he kept saying that Wei Cheng must not run around outside. Wei Cheng said: "The more I think about it, the more it is him. Besides Fei Changhe, there won't be a second one. He sees me and still calls me Young Master Ye, saying that the Ye family of Shide Hall is the only one who can do such a vicious and rogue thing." As Wei Cheng spoke, he touched the table with his hand, clenched his fist, and hammered it up and down on the table. Second Madam Ye said: "Don't be so angry. I will send Ah Xing out to take a look. Ah Xing goes west, He Zixing goes east. If it is really Fei Changhe who did it, you can't see it on Fei Changhe's face, you can always see it on Fei Changhe's wife and daughter's faces. This is a robbery case. It's not child's play." Wei Cheng raised his face and said: "Aunt, then let them go. I want them to come back within an hour." (164)

### Artists at Shangjian: Han Fei Exercises Greatly with Dumbbells

— Shi Ren

It seems that fate has destined those surnamed Han to be thin. Han Fei's thinness is almost the same as Han Langen's. Audiences who have seen him play "Robinson Crusoe" at the Carlton will never forget his bare-footed, naked, skinny and funny state, right? The reason why he can make people remember him particularly deeply is, of course, thanks to his natural and humorous style, and especially his thinness has given us a very deep impression.

Logically, "thin" is beneficial and harmless to Han Fei, but he himself thinks otherwise. The day before yesterday morning, I went to the Shanghai Fitness Academy and accidentally met him also exercising greatly with dumbbells in the gym, his muscles all over his body were extremely tense, which is clear evidence that he is not willing to be thin for a long time. I also saw the great director Zuo Lin, famous actor Hu Xin'an, and Shi Hui, Yingzi, Shen Min, Mo Chou, etc.

More than a dozen people were there. It was a pleasure to meet them in the gym. I had a brief conversation with them. From Shi Hui's mouth, I learned that their hard work is: exercising their bodies, learning to dance, immersing themselves in literature, and devoting themselves to art.

After they finished their morning exercises, they rehearsed the new play "The Great Trap" at the academy, preparing to perform it in the autumn, but there is no ground yet, but that will certainly not be a problem, let us wait and see. When we meet them on the stage again, not only others, but also Mr. Thin Han Fei may become a strongman, because under the guidance of Zhao Zhuguang, the president of the academy, who is rich in experience and knowledge, there is indeed unlimited hope and confidence in the transformation of their physiques.
