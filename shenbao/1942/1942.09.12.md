### British and French Re-invasion: French Madagascar Coast Occupied at Three Important Points with Prior Full US Approval

Lisbon, 11th (Allied News Agency) – The British War Department announced yesterday that British forces again took military action against the French island of Madagascar in Africa yesterday morning. The battle is proceeding smoothly. After the port of Diego Suarez on the island was occupied, the British government negotiated with the governor of the island, so as to take the necessary steps on the island to prevent the Axis powers from obtaining military bases and other facilities. This proposal was rejected, and force was resorted to. However, it must be stated again that Britain has no territorial ambitions for the island.

Xiongcheng, 11th (Allied News Agency) – London News: British Prime Minister Churchill announced in the House of Commons today that British troops attacking Madagascar have occupied three coastal locations. It is believed that these three locations are Anjiaga (120 miles south of Diego Suarez), the important port of Majunga, and Morondava, 340 miles south of it. British forces launched attacks on these three locations simultaneously yesterday morning.

Washington, 10th (Havas News Agency) – The State Department has announced that Britain's offensive on the French island of Madagascar has been fully approved by the United States. If any of the Axis powers occupy part of the French colonies, it will pose a serious threat to the Allies. "Therefore, the British army's occupation of the entire island of Madagascar will make a significant contribution to defeating the Axis powers and will promote the common interests of the Allies."

### Protecting Shipping Lanes: Madagascar a Must-Have

Vichy, 10th (Havas News Agency) – The authorities announced this afternoon that British forces had again attacked French Madagascar. The news came suddenly, and public opinion was shocked. Four months ago, British forces first attacked Madagascar, intending to occupy the port of Diego Suarez on the island. The first landing was on May 5th this year, under the command of Major General Sturges and Rear Admiral Syflett. The French army and navy resisted strongly. It was not until the 15th that the British army completely occupied the area. Since then, the British army has controlled the northern corner of Madagascar and the good port of Suarez. At that time, the British army seemed to intend to stay there, but continued to advance south. A status quo situation was formed between the British occupying forces in the northern corner and the French authorities governing other parts of the island. During the fierce battle, Madagascar Governor Anet assured Marshal Pétain that the people of the entire island were loyal to the French government and had no second thoughts. Judging from the situation in recent months, this guarantee is true. Recently, after the opening of a regular air route between Madagascar and the French mainland, relations between the two sides have become even stronger. On July 2nd this year, the French island of Mayotte in the northern part of the Mozambique Channel (the boundary between Portuguese East Africa and Madagascar) was occupied by British forces again. The island's garrison had only a small number of gendarmes, so the British army did not encounter any actual resistance. The above is a brief history of the British army's invasion of Madagascar. As for the British army's decision to attack again this time, it is estimated that its goal is to completely control the Mozambique Channel, because the channel is the only way for British convoys traveling from Cape Town to the Red Sea. When landing at the port of Suarez, the British army used a powerful fleet and a large number of ground troops, as well as several naval aircraft squadrons to assist in the battle. The ports on the west coast of Madagascar were attacked simultaneously at dawn yesterday. The main force attacked the port of Majunga at the mouth of the Koba River, while other troops attacked the Morondava Lane between Mongoja and Zare Pihexima south of it. The French army and navy are resisting. According to reports, two days ago, French troops repelled the Tegol faction troops attempting to land north of the port of Majunga.

Berlin, 11th (Haitong News Agency) – After the news of the British attack on Madagascar spread, Berliners believed that this move had a strategic effect. The British army's supplies to the Near East are mostly shipped from West Africa. Therefore, the British army's attack on Madagascar actually has the effect of covering the shipping routes.

Stockholm, Sweden, 11th (Haitong News Agency) – The news of the British army's large-scale attack on Madagascar surprised the people of both Britain and France. Vichy has not yet received detailed information. The strategic importance of Madagascar can be seen from the map. It can protect Britain's sea route around the Cape of Good Hope to India. It is expected that the British army's plan to re-invade Madagascar this time must have been discussed during the recent meeting between Churchill and South African Federal Prime Minister Smuts.

### French People Express Anger at British Aggression

Vichy, 10th (Havas News Agency) – It is learned that the British army has launched an offensive on several points on the west coast of French Madagascar, and eight British warships have been seen in the port of Majunga. The official announcement on this matter is as follows: After the Tegol faction landed 10 miles north of the port of Majunga on the 8th of this month, the British army ordered a general offensive on the west coast of Madagascar this month. At dawn today, a team of British warships arrived off the coast of the French colony. The British army simultaneously attacked Majunga, Ayaga, and Morondala. Groups of British planes flew over the island, invading 100 miles inland. The French people are deeply indignant at this act of aggression and unanimously condemn it. They express deep sympathy and concern for those who are fighting bravely to protect France's glory and interests against all odds.

### Soviet Troops Hold Fast to the Black Sea Port: Fierce Battle on the Front Lines of the City of S.

Moscow, 11th (Allied News Agency) – Military sources say that the German army attacking Stalingrad on the Volga River has received reinforcements from a large number of German and Italian troops and air squadrons. At great sacrifice, they are expanding their wedge-shaped penetration into the Soviet defense line. The Red Army is determined to continue resisting, and in the past 48 hours, it has abandoned five locations around the city. More fierce fighting is taking place in the Black Sea naval port of Novorossiysk (Berlin has previously reported that it has occupied the port). The Soviet army is fighting against all odds to defend the city. Buildings in the city are on fire, and thick smoke is billowing. A German force that broke into the northwestern suburbs of the city received reinforcements last night and continued to attack the city. The Soviet army and the Black Sea Fleet's Marines are defending the city, fighting for every inch of land, and constantly counterattacking. The sound of artillery fire is deafening day and night.

Moscow, 10th (Havas News Agency) – The General Headquarters of the Red Army issued a battle report stating that in the past 24 hours, our army fought fiercely west, southwest, and in the Jzduk district of Stalingrad. Street battles are taking place in the urban area of ​​Novorossiysk. Except for the abandonment of three villages on the west side of the city, there were no major battles in other areas of the front lines.

### Siberian Troops Transferred Eastward to Defend the "Heart of Russia"

Berlin, 11th (Haitong News Agency) – According to the latest news from the front lines, the Soviet headquarters also acknowledged the seriousness of the situation in Stalingrad. All residents in the area, except for women and children, are now engaged in defending the central and important areas of the city. It is reported that the city's garrison also includes Siberian assault teams. Berliners believe that this is because after Timoshenko's offensive in Kharkov collapsed, the Soviet army also realized that the city of S. was threatened, so they transferred the Siberian army to fight in the heart of Russia. The city's defenders are still resisting the German army's attack to the death. People here claim that the German army had long expected that taking Stalingrad would not be easy, but the stubborn resistance of the Soviet army cannot change the fate of the city of S., which has already been decided. The encirclement of the city is being narrowed today. After the fall of Davidovka, it is now only 10 kilometers northwest of the city. On the Novorossiysk front, Romanian troops continued to make progress in the south of the area. The battle is still in progress. Soviet tanks suffered heavy damage in the east. On the Terk front, Berlin did not receive detailed war news yesterday, only that the Soviet army continued to attack the German bridgehead. On Lake Ilmen, the Soviet army used guerrillas to disrupt the German rear, suffering heavy casualties.

Soviet Aircraft Night Attack on Hungarian City

Budapest, 10th (Havas News Agency) – According to news released by the person in charge here today, when Soviet aircraft recently attacked Hungary, they did not bring paratroopers to land in the country. The paratroopers seen in some places are all those who landed secretly one after another, and did not come with the air raid aircraft. Therefore, the Hungarian authorities have ordered that when the people of the whole country discover enemy paratroopers landing, they must report to the authorities. Anyone who hides and does not report will be submitted to a military court for trial and executed within 24 hours.

Budapest, 11th (Haitong News Agency) – The night before yesterday, when Soviet aircraft bombed the Hungarian capital and other cities, the Hungarian anti-aircraft fire was very fierce.

### British Members of Parliament Attack the Policy Towards India: Prime Minister Churchill's Speech, Speaker Has Rejected Debate

London, 10th (Havas News Agency) – After Prime Minister Churchill delivered a speech in the House of Commons yesterday, elucidating the British policy towards India, some members of parliament spoke in succession, criticizing it. First, Labor MP Willer said, "The Prime Minister's words are exactly the same as the statements he made on the Indian issue several years ago, which will shock hundreds of millions of people in both Britain and India, and only make those who support Britain even more disappointed. We dare to ask the Prime Minister, does he believe that criticizing the Indian National Congress Party will improve the current situation? Or does he believe that suppressing the National Congress Party is enough to solve the Indian problem? It is rumored that 50,000 workers in the armaments industry have gone on strike. Please also answer whether this is true." Then, Labor MP Witte said, "Public opinion feels that the Indian incident is difficult to handle. We dare to ask whether the Prime Minister's government will issue a statement of its own on this matter." At this point, Prime Minister Churchill replied, "I also admit that it is necessary to explain the situation to the people of Britain and the United States." MP Witte then asked whether the National Congress Party had any intention of accepting the proposals made by Sir Cripps. Prime Minister Churchill replied again, "Whether this matter has developed to this point, or will develop to this point in the shortest possible time, there is no trace to be found at present. As far as the current situation in India is concerned, there is indeed a danger of foreign aggression, but at this time it is quite difficult to solve the constitutional problem." When Hearwell heard this, he asked again, inquiring whether the government had sent reinforcements to India to increase the number of probes to suppress the Indian independence movement when necessary. We often hear the saying that India will be the second war wound. Will the government really regard India as the second war wound? The Prime Minister immediately replied, "The task of the reinforcements sent to India is to protect the people of India." MP Willer then asked whether the government would allow the House of Commons to vote on the speech made by the Prime Minister to publicly express approval or opposition. The Prime Minister immediately replied, "I cannot amend the rules of procedure." At this point, Maxstone, leader of the Independent Labor Party, said, "I dare say that what Prime Minister Churchill said is completely true in essence, but I cannot but ask whether his words contain propaganda." Labor MP Bei Wang also fiercely criticized the Prime Minister and asked whether the wartime cabinet agreed with the content of Prime Minister Churchill's speech. The Prime Minister replied, "My speech actually includes the policies of the British government." MP Bei Wang then asked whether Deputy Prime Minister Atlee and Director of State Cripps agreed with the Prime Minister's speech. The Prime Minister replied, "I have various reasons to believe that my colleagues will be able to agree with my actions, just as I believe that the next parliament will be able to express its agreement, without any difference." Bei Wang also said, "If the House of Commons can do this, then all members will be ashamed of it." However, Conservative MP Aster supported the Prime Minister's speech and said, "The Indian army fighting in the Middle East will surely receive great comfort from this."

Stockholm, Sweden, 11th (Haitong News Agency) – The motion by Conservative MPs in the British House of Commons requesting an immediate debate on British Prime Minister Churchill's Indian broadcast was rejected by the Speaker of the House yesterday, stating that the document could not be submitted for debate immediately due to certain technical problems.

Britain and Gandhi No Longer Negotiate

Stockholm, Sweden, 11th (Haitong News Agency) – According to news from London, British Secretary of State for India Amery announced in the House of Commons yesterday that Britain has no room for negotiation with Gandhi.

One is to announce India's immediate independence and seek to break the current deadlock, requesting Britain to start negotiations with the main political parties in India.

### British, Soviet, and American Labor Union Cooperation Issues

Blackpool, England, 10th (Havas News Agency) – Sir Shettlin, Chairman of the British Trades Union Congress, gave a speech at the conference today, stating, "The Executive Committee of the American Federation of Labor has expressed opposition to the proposal to form a committee with the Soviet labor union. Regarding this matter, the labor unions of Britain and the United States originally scheduled to contact each other, and then, at the request of the British government, in order for British labor representatives to visit the United States at this time, the political exhibition has been postponed to this day, and has not yet been completed. It has been found that the joint committee organized by representatives of British and Soviet labor unions has seen its affairs develop daily. I think this is a normal and gratifying thing, so I have decided to invite representatives of the American labor union to participate in this committee together. It is a pity that the American labor union has failed to accept this invitation. As for the British labor union representatives' visit to the United States, the association and the government are in complete agreement, and it is appropriate to postpone the visit to the United States."

Stockholm, Sweden, 10th (Havas News Agency) – German High Commissioner to Norway Terboven has signed an order stating that Norway should compensate for the losses suffered by German expatriate property during the German invasion of Norway in 1940. Norway should also be responsible for the losses suffered by the German side during the British bombing and landing attacks on Norway.

Another message said that the German army is conducting large-scale exercises in the mountainous area of ​​Norway in recent days.

### French Anti-Semitism: Further Efforts

U.S. Chargé d'Affaires' Protest Ineffective

Paris, 11th (Haitong News Agency) - The Jewish question in France has now reached a new peak. Since the new Laval cabinet took office, due to the intensity of French anti-Semitic sentiment, the commissioner for Jewish affairs, Vallat, was dismissed and replaced by Pellepoix. All Jews who entered France after 1938 have been arrested. The French Catholic Church is divided on the Jewish issue. The pro-Vichy faction, led by the Archbishop of Paris, Suhard, is fiercely anti-Semitic, while the pro-Jewish faction is led by the Archbishop of Lyon, Gerlier. The U.S. Chargé d'Affaires protested the French authorities' mistreatment of Jews, but was rejected. General Vincent, the commander in Lyon, was immediately dismissed for refusing to send troops to arrest foreign Jews. It is rumored that the French government will soon launch a large-scale anti-Semitic campaign to make the French people aware of the Jewish threat faced by the country.

### 700 Romanian Jews Detained in Concentration Camps

### A Japanese Journalist in New York Recounts the Scenes of Japan-U.S. War (3)

Original work by Mr. Inamoto, Director of the New York Branch of the Japanese Domei News Agency

Mr. Kunio Inamoto, the former director of the New York branch of the Japanese Domei News Agency, was sent to Ellis Island after the outbreak of the Pacific War and has recently been repatriated to Japan. He wrote a detailed account of his experiences, which is very interesting. The translation of this article has been published in this newspaper for the past two days, and today we will continue to publish the final few sections.

Three Impressions Long Remembered

The impressions and facts that I will never forget are: First, the "Remember Pearl Harbor" warning posted in the waiting room at the pier; second, the sight of Broadway that I saw for the last time; and third, the annoyance of discovering that valuable items in my residence were missing. The next day, we returned to Ellis Island. On December 30th, we were sent to Pennsylvania Station and transferred to the Homestead Hotel in Hot Springs, Virginia, where we met personnel from the Japanese Consulate General in New York. On December 31st, we met with Japanese diplomats again.

Old-fashioned Hotel Accommodates 800 Guests

The Homestead Hotel, where we stayed, was established during the Civil War, and almost all of its employees were Black. The building was old-fashioned, but it could accommodate 800 guests. On New Year's Day, the Japanese Ambassador to the United States, Nomura, addressed us and bowed to the Imperial Palace from afar. The main points of Nomura's speech were that this war would be protracted and that there would be countless difficulties ahead. Everyone should maintain their health and train themselves spiritually so that they can return to Japan in the future and do their best to serve the country in their respective positions.

Engaging in Sports in Early Spring

In the hotel, we could freely purchase and read any newspaper, but a new rule was implemented at the end of January, allowing us to purchase only the New York Times. We could enter the garden in the hotel, and since it was already spring, we were able to engage in outdoor games. For a fee, we could also enter the 25-meter swimming pool, so we got plenty of exercise. The New York Times tried to give the public the impression that the overall situation was favorable to the Allied Powers, but after New Year's Day, the newspaper announced the fall of Manila and then admitted the successive losses of Singapore and the Dutch East Indies and the victory of the Japanese Navy in the Java Sea.

Second Relocation to White Sulphur Springs

At the end of March, the contract between the government and the Homestead Hotel expired, and we moved to the Greenbrier Hotel in White Sulphur Springs (also in Virginia), where we met German expatriates who were being detained there. The hotel was once extremely crowded, with about 400 German expatriates alone. By May 6th, the German expatriates had returned to their country, and we felt more spacious. We had no way of knowing the actual situation in the United States except by reading newspapers. However, the hotel began rationing sugar, which indicated that sugar would be in short supply, and the pants sold in the hotel's attached store had no pleats at the cuffs, indicating that clothing materials were also scarce.

Hearing News of Withdrawal, Everyone Was Delighted

At the same time, negotiations for the exchange of American and Japanese expatriates were progressing smoothly. At the end of May, a notice was posted in the hotel lobby stating that we would be evacuated soon, which made us very happy. The notice stated: "Detained Japanese expatriates will leave the hotel on June 8th and board the Gripsholm the next day in New Jersey, bound for Lourenço Marques. At 8:00 AM on June 11th, we boarded a train to Washington Station, but were not allowed to get off. When the train pulled out, we silently bid farewell to the gardens of the White House. At 12:30 PM, we arrived at the New Jersey pier, and around 3:00 PM, we boarded the ship one after another.

All Items

The ship belonged to Sweden and had a large white cross painted on it, as well as the words "Transporting Diplomatic Personnel." One Japanese expatriate said on the ship: "When we left the concentration camp, we all hoped to board the ship immediately, but we were sent to the Pennsylvania Hotel. The next day, government officials, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and customs officials came to inspect our luggage. Wireless communication devices, cameras, leather and rubber items were confiscated. Each person was limited to ten razor blades and was prohibited from carrying more than one undershirt onto the ship.

Refund of Deposits but Subject to Tax

Travelers were subjected to strict searches, and even the seams of their suitcases were searched to prevent the smuggling of documents. Another blow to us was that we had to pay taxes. When we arrived at the hotel, the money that had been taken from us in the concentration camp was refunded. Before long, the responsible official asked us to pay the taxes we owed from the time we were detained until May, and asked about the remaining cash. We could not lie, so we told the truth. For example, if we had 500 yuan left, we were only allowed to take 300 yuan, and the remaining 200 yuan was confiscated."

The United States Gradually Enters a Wartime State

Another traveler said: "I tried to get a general reaction from the American public to the Japanese military victories, but I failed. The only emotion of the residents of New York seemed to be indifference. The most obvious change in American daily life was the increasing number of men wearing military uniforms. Automobile traffic decreased due to the ban on the sale of tires and restrictions on gasoline consumption. Sugar was rationed, but the amount issued was still sufficient for daily needs."

### Major Department Stores Increase Prices Appropriately, Protecting the Legitimate Profits of Both Buyers and Sellers; Small Shops Will Soon Be Controlled

With the approval of the Central China Liaison Office of the Asia Development Board, major department stores on Nanjing Road under its supervision are allowed to increase prices by 10-20% based on the prices set on September 1st according to the new price control policy. The central reason for implementing this measure is the increase in the purchase price of goods for the companies. In other words, if the previous purchase price of the same goods was 120 yuan and the retail price was 140 yuan, it was obviously very reasonable. Now the purchase price may increase to 135 yuan. If the selling price continues to be 140 yuan, it would be unfair to the company. Therefore, it is necessary to slightly increase the price of new goods compared to the existing stock, which would not be unfair to customers.

According to the reporter's investigation, the most obvious manifestation of the above phenomenon is the China National Goods Company. Starting from September 2nd, the company reduced the prices of goods to half of the old legal tender prices in May, so business has been booming in recent days. However, in the past day or two, with the approval of the Asia Development Board to maintain legitimate profit margins, the prices have been slightly increased compared to before. The situation of other major department stores is similar. It is reported that the current pricing standards of various companies are quite complicated, including the average price of the old legal tender at the end of May, the previous purchase price, the previous selling price, the current purchase price, and the current selling price. These five stages of prices are intertwined. The Asia Development Board's pricing measures for major companies seek the fairest price among these five prices, so as not to cause losses to either buyers or sellers.

On the part of the Asia Development Board, since major companies on Nanjing Road are already under control, it is necessary to carefully plan the pricing of these companies. Small shops are usually controlled by the Public Works Department, the Municipal Council, or the Shanghai West Police Bureau. However, since September 1st, they have not followed the authorities' new method of suppressing prices. Therefore, these shops have been evaluated and priced by the industry price evaluation committee in the lower part of July, and implemented with the approval of the authorities in each district. In order to show consistency, the authorities will soon control each industry association and instruct them to re-evaluate prices according to the current situation, which will be of great benefit to the overall price situation in the future.

It is reported that the authorities' price suppression will definitely not end with the implementation of the new price management policy, but will intensify the promulgation of specific measures to promote its full implementation. Informed sources revealed that the current authorities are considering the preparation of a general list of price limits for goods, because the previous price lists for various items were too fragmented and unsystematic. In the future, it may be possible to combine the prices of various items into one list, and instruct all shops to follow it uniformly. Another consideration is the penalties for violations. The past penalties were fines or temporary suspension of business for a few days. In the future, if there are violations of the regulations, it may be possible to revoke the business license and order permanent closure.

### Repatriation of Overseas Chinese in the Americas Postponed, Possibly Delayed by a Month; Reason Still Unknown

The English-language "Great American Evening News" reported that a key official of the Japanese Consulate General recently stated that the repatriation of overseas Chinese in North and South America in Shanghai, originally scheduled for September 9th and 10th, has been postponed, and the postponement period is longer than previously expected. According to the latest information, it may be delayed by a month. Therefore, the repatriation ship will definitely not depart this month. The repatriation ship Conte Verde has now returned to Shanghai and returned to the Italian Shipping Company. If it is to be leased again and returned to Lourenço Marques, it will take at least two weeks of preparation. There is still no news about the reasons for the postponement of the repatriation of overseas Chinese in North and South America, and the approximate date of departure. It is reported that the Conte Verde was originally scheduled to leave Shanghai with the Asama Maru, sending 1,350 to 1,500 overseas Chinese, including about 800 American expatriates in Shanghai. The plan for 400 North American expatriates to gather in Shanghai had already been drafted, but so far only 15 people have arrived in Shanghai, and the rest have been temporarily blocked and will come to Shanghai when the repatriation ship is about to set sail.

### Three Extravagant Guests at Entertainment Venues Fabricated a Business Name: The De Wei Trading Company Was Lavishly Decorated, and They Were Arrested and Investigated for Issuing Large Amounts of Bad Checks

Yao Yongtao (resident of 85 Dunxin Road), Cheng Qingquan (also known as Ding Ding Cheng, resident of 6, Lane 40, Rue de la Cathédrale), and Shi Bosun (resident of 3, Lane 6, Xiaoshadu Road), all of Shanghai, opened the De Wei Trading Company in Room 209 of the Sassoon House on Nanjing Road. The company was lavishly decorated and employed female staff. When Cheng and the others went out to play, they frequented high-end venues such as the International Hotel, the Paramount, the New Celestial Forest Dance Hall, and the Red Cotton Restaurant. They spent generously on dance tickets and tipped the waiters hundreds of dollars at a time. Therefore, almost everyone in the entertainment venues knew these three extravagant guests. The three were even able to sign the bills when they were playing, without having to pay in cash. Little did they know that their actions were actually part of a

Planned Fraud

The De Wei Company, run by Yao Yongshou, Cheng Qingquan, and Shi Bosun, did not engage in the import and export of any goods. In order to make the customers believe that the company had strong assets, they spared no expense in their extravagant actions. This plan was successful in achieving its goal. For example, Hongda Company, located in Room 301 of the Cishu Building on Nanjing Road, recently sold goods worth more than 10,000 yuan to De Wei. At that time, De Wei issued a check from the Zhejiang Industrial Bank, but it bounced when it was due, and repeated demands were unsuccessful. Therefore, the Central Detective Bureau was reported, and the Chinese detective Cheng Renkun arrested Yao, Cheng, and Shi. According to a rough investigation, the De Wei Company recently issued

Six or Seventy Thousand Yuan

worth of bad checks to defraud goods of equal value, while the actual amount of money in the Zhejiang Industrial Bank was only 20 yuan. The money they owed at the International Hotel, the Paramount Dance Hall, the New Celestial Forest Dance Hall, and the Red Cotton Restaurant was not included. Because further investigation is still needed, they are being detained for investigation before being sent for further examination.

### Rice and Flour Rationing for the Eleventh Period

One Sheng of White Rice, Half Sheng of Broken Rice, and Half Jin of Flour at Will

The Public Works Department recently issued a notice stating that the No. 10 coupon of the rice purchase certificate, which is used to purchase rice and flour from the Public Works Department, is only valid until the 12th of this month and will be invalid after the expiration date. During the period from the 14th to the 19th of this month, rice shops and the Public Works Department's rice sales offices will only sell rice with the No. 11 coupon of the rice purchase certificate. At that time, the rice shops marked with the registration number on the coupon will sell one sheng of white rice and half a sheng of broken rice for a total price of 3.8 yuan per coupon. At the same time, the coupon holder can freely purchase half a jin of flour for a price of 1.15 yuan.

Rice Shop Numbers May Have Changed

The fourth batch of rice purchase certificates has been distributed. In order to prevent taxpayers from colluding with rice shops and engaging in fraud, the rice shop numbers on the certificates may be changed again. Therefore, those who hold rice purchase certificates should note the number on the coupon when receiving household rations and purchase from the rice shop with the same number to avoid errors.

### French Concession Civil Police Accelerate Organization

Full Service in the Near Future

The pilot patrols of the French Concession Civil Police Corps will be extended from the Central District to other districts starting today. The full list of members will be reviewed by the police stations in each district within one or two days, and it is expected that the entire organization will be established within one or two weeks. It is reported that the current French Concession Civil Police Corps is only temporary in nature, so the equipment is not complete and there are no fixed posts. Once the authorities have compiled the list of Civil Police Corps members, they can be officially established. At present, the authorities are actively purchasing a large number of items for the Civil Police Corps, such as batons, whistles, police ropes, etc. After procurement, they will be distributed to the Civil Police Corps members separately. The French Concession Civil Police should be able to be fully completed in the near future.

The French Concession Police Department is vigorously promoting the Baojia system and has recently ordered each district to expedite the Civil Police Corps and pilot patrols. It has been several months since the implementation of the Baojia system. There are frequent cases of residents moving in and out of the concession, and some residents have not reported the move in accordance with the regulations because they are not familiar with the procedures. Therefore, each district has been instructed to instruct each joint Baojia to conduct a re-examination of household registration. If there are cases of movement that have not been reported, they should be strictly urged to handle the reporting procedures immediately. Otherwise, if the police authorities send personnel to investigate and discover them in the future, they will be dealt with according to the law. Therefore, the joint Baojia heads in each district of the concession are currently conducting re-examinations separately.

### More Than 300 Shops in Nanshi and Zhabei Are Raising Prices; Punishment Has Been Implemented

More than 300 shops in Nanshi, Zhabei, Pudong, and other places have been found to have raised prices in violation of regulations. The investigations have been completed separately, and fines or business suspensions have been imposed in various places. The enforcement has started in the Nanshi District and will be extended to Zhabei, Pudong, and other districts in turn. On the one hand, the market situation is still being investigated. According to information learned from the Public Concession, four more shops have recently been charged in court for using inaccurate weights and measures. One of them is a rice shop, and in the past month, two illegal rice shops have had their registration certificates revoked for cheating with measuring instruments.

### Counterfeit Whiskey Case Cracked; Contacted Restaurant Waiters to Purchase Empty Bottles of Original Product; Inferior Foreign Liquor Mixed with Coloring to Deceive the Public

The Public Concession Police Department cracked a counterfeit Johnnie Walker Red Label whiskey operation early last week and arrested three principal offenders. The trial opened yesterday (the 11th). According to Detective Konovalov, who handled the case, the counterfeit whiskey had been sold for two months. The

Counterfeit Method Was Ingenious

so that even Johnnie Walker's sole agent in the city, J. L. Morrison & Co., could not distinguish between the genuine and the fake. The principal offender was named Zhang Yuguang (transliteration), and the accomplices were Kong Linzi and Wang Yuxin (both transliterations). These people first contacted waiters in major restaurants to purchase empty bottles and boxes of Johnnie Walker, ensuring that the bottle caps were not damaged. The price for each bottle was 10 to 20 yuan. The counterfeiting site was located in the principal offender's residence on Chengdu Road. They mixed inferior Scotch whiskey with coloring to create a product that was almost indistinguishable from the real thing. The accomplices were responsible for selling the counterfeit whiskey. When they encountered buyers, they lied that the whiskey had been stolen from the Wing On Company's warehouse and that they were eager to

Sell at Half Price

the market price. The average price was 150 yuan per bottle and about 1,800 yuan per case. The counterfeit whiskey was stronger than the genuine product, but the quality was far inferior. The police first received a report that someone was selling counterfeit whiskey at a low price, so they sent a detective to pose as a buyer and make contact. They arrested the person on the spot and seized a dozen bottles of counterfeit whiskey. They then arrested the principal offender and the accomplices and seized 20 cases of counterfeit whiskey, thus completely cracking the case.

### Private Hotel Did Not Provide Meals and Refused to Obtain a Sublease License

Sentenced to Seven Days of Detention

Yu Changsheng operated a private hotel at 40, Lane 41, Rue Cardinal Mercier. There were no meal facilities. According to Public Works Department Announcement No. 5896, he should have obtained a sublease housing license. After being notified by the department, he delayed in doing so and cut off the electricity supply to some tenants in an attempt to force them to move out. After being discovered by the department, he was prosecuted in the First Special District Court. On the 10th of this month, he was sentenced to seven days of detention as a warning.

### Anhui Native Place Association Actively Evacuating People; Now Relocated to New Office

The Anhui Native Place Association in Shanghai has been participating in the Chinese Evacuation Committee to assist in the evacuation of fellow Anhui natives for half a year, reaching more than 2,000 people. There are many fellow natives from various counties in Anhui Province in Shanghai, especially unemployed workers. The association, seeing that life is becoming increasingly difficult and that fellow natives are requesting relief, has appealed to fellow natives in Shanghai and other places for assistance and has received considerable support. They are still actively issuing return-to-hometown certificates every day, providing various conveniences. They hope that fellow natives who return to their hometown will register as soon as possible. Those who are poor and unable to afford it only need a guarantee from the Baojia head. After investigation and confirmation, they can apply for subsidies from the authorities for travel expenses. The association can also provide some financial assistance to help them return to their hometown as soon as possible and find a new livelihood. The original office at Caobao Road is no longer in use. It has recently been relocated to 13, Zhaofang Lane, Zhaofangli, Laoximen.

Recently, someone claiming to be a Chinese scientist, Yang Ming, invented so-called Chinese-made kerosene and distributed a prospectus for raising shares in the Chinese-Made Kerosene United Company, which included a section on the "Public Test by the Municipal Chamber of Commerce." It is now heard that the Chamber of Commerce denies this prospectus.

### Mingfu Library to Reopen Regularly

Generous Donations of Books

The Mingfu Library on Avenue Albert in Shanghai was established by the Science Society of China. The books in its collection are all of a specialized scientific nature and are used by society members and the academic community for research and reference. Due to financial difficulties, the library dismissed its staff and temporarily closed in April of this year, which caused great inconvenience to society members and scholars. Now, at the request of the majority of its members, the Shanghai Alumni Association of the society has come forward to manage the library and has organized a library committee to manage the library's affairs. The committee members take turns to the library for voluntary office work and internal sorting. For nearly half a month, members and people from all walks of life have been donating books generously. A notice has been issued stating that the library will reopen regularly on the 15th of this month. The reading hours are from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM every Tuesday to Saturday, and from 8:00 AM to 12:00 PM on Sunday mornings. The library is closed on Mondays. The reading fee is 10 yuan per year for members and 20 yuan per year for non-members.

### Mr. Pu sends longevity bowls; Re-gifted to the Lun Society

Serving society is the duty of colleagues; Over-the-top praise makes me deeply ashamed

Our newspaper received a letter from Mr. Pu Qiting yesterday, which reads, "Dear Sirs, I deeply admire your service to society and promotion of good deeds. I am now sending five pairs of longevity bowls for Mr. Ma Xiangbo's 100th birthday, wishing you good health and happiness, and longevity like Mr. Ma. This also expresses the gratitude of poor compatriots who, with every meal, remember your kindness as if reborn. The gift is small, but the meaning is great. I hope you will accept it with a smile and not refuse. Sincerely, Mr. Pu Qiting, bowing, September 11th," and also sent five pairs of longevity bowls to the office. Our colleagues at the newspaper, after reading this letter, felt deeply ashamed and frightened. The excessive praise is truly beyond our deserts. We believe that newspapers are public instruments of society, becoming one with the readers. Everything that our newspaper can do to contribute a small amount is due to the support of the public. Serving is our duty. We dare not accept Mr. Pu's generous gift. However, because the letter is sincere and the intention is earnest, and we have nothing to return, after repeated consideration, we respectfully re-gift the five pairs of longevity bowls to the colleagues of the Lun Society who have contributed the most to this year's student aid fund, to thank Mr. Pu for his kindness. Furthermore, our colleagues at the newspaper do not accept gifts from outside. If readers are willing to fulfill their grand aspirations and support our newspaper, working together to serve society, the blessings that our colleagues will receive will be immeasurable.

### Piecework

"Better than nothing, even if it's just two pennies" is the general mentality of general laborers. Although there are those who genuinely want to earn money, like the woman mentioned above who makes two hundred bags a day, that mostly happens when the man of the house can't earn money and the woman does some helping. But even that is barely enough for one person to eat. It's better to be a maid. In addition, there are those who show off their skills, but to say that it's something they absolutely have to do... that's simply not the case.

"Piecework" is the humorous term for this type of work (the meaning is almost the opposite). The cosmetics factory and medicine bag factory mentioned above are just two examples. It's common in other industries as well. Let me give you some examples: In medicine factories: labeling bottles, wrapping covers. In candy shops: peeling broad beans. In bean sprout farms: removing the roots of yellow bean sprouts. In northern goods stores: cracking walnuts, picking melon seeds. In tailoring shops: making buttonholes. In felt factories: making tassels for felt rugs. In tea shops: sorting tea leaves. In undershirt factories: sewing buttons. In small cigarette factories: tearing cigarette leaves… These are just the industries I can think of. There are even stranger industries, like medicine bag factories, etc.

The common characteristics are low wages, the workers are all women, more freedom than ordinary workers, and short-term work. Let me explain the last point: This type of work is not something you can do year-round. At the very least, it's intermittent. After working for a week or a month, you take a break for a certain period, waiting for the next batch of goods to come before doing it again. This is because some of the work is seasonal, like peeling broad beans and picking melon seeds. After a few days, there's nothing left to do. Some of it is opportunistic, like making buttonholes and felt rugs. Once this batch of business is contracted, they're busy for a while. They don't know if there will be a next time. Some of it is dependent. For example, pasting labels on bottles and tearing cigarette leaves. They have to wait for the regular workers to produce a certain amount of medicine or cigarettes before they get busy. The degree of busyness also depends on how the medicines and cigarettes are selling. Think about it, if workers rely on this kind of work to live, wouldn't they often go hungry?

Wages and the worker's freedom are inversely proportional. Although wages are generally low, there are differences. For example, picking melon seeds is much better than removing the roots of yellow bean sprouts. Cracking walnuts is much better than peeling broad beans. Actually, "freedom" is too fashionable of a term. This point is true: If the wages are higher, people are more eager to do it, so they are more cautious towards the staff and such.

Let's compare picking melon seeds and removing the roots of yellow bean sprouts. Both pay two cents per catty. However, the dirt and rotten things in melon seeds are much less than the roots of yellow bean sprouts. So, a fast worker can pick up to twenty catties of melon seeds a day. If you're lucky and the melon seeds are all clean, picking yellow bean sprout roots is a different story. I remember that sometimes my mom would buy a catty of yellow bean sprouts, and my two younger brothers and I would remove the roots. We'd be hunched over, silently working, and often wouldn't be finished after more than half an hour. Strangely enough, there was actually someone who could remove more than twenty catties a day! I didn't see this person, but I've seen people who can usually remove fifteen catties a day. Wiping away sweat, chatting loudly, while both hands work at the same time. The index fingers of both hands have two or three-tenths of an inch long fingernails. *Chacha li!* As soon as the bean sprout touches the fingernail, the root breaks off. Both hands move back and forth quickly. Soon, a big pile is finished. Fingernails, fingertips are all clean and white. The skill is amazing.

In Shanghai, there are always dozens of people doing "piecework." Besides the name being relatively new, if you live in a lane house, you should often see them.

Speaking of Shanghai, how many women are likely to do this kind of piecework? I dare say, there are hundreds of thousands! If prices keep rising, this situation will become public. That is to say, the old women will no longer say: "Better than nothing, let's make some extra money..." but will say: "Should I do it or not? Doing it is better than nothing, there is some money to be seen..." People will have the mentality of: "Better than nothing, I will do it", and will be clamoring to do this kind of work.

Those bosses are of course clever people. Society excludes women from the ranks of production. It is like discarding goods on the ground, wasting countless amounts of labor. They take the opportunity to pick up the "goods". This is what is meant by "getting extra work". The term "piecework" is correct.

If China had such a day, where it could rationally and fully utilize labor, I don't know how many treasures, like mining, would be developed. (To be continued)

### Purchasers of Government Bonds Mostly Take Actual Delivery, Creating a Situation of Soaring Prices

Yesterday, the unified government bond market continued its upward trend, soaring again. This was because most purchasers took actual delivery, causing the number of chips on the table to become increasingly tight. Moreover, sellers were floating and uneasy, making up for losses even more. The frenzy to find air in the wound can be described as unprecedented. Although the sellers tried to suppress the market at the opening, they could not resist the ease of money due to limited chips. Therefore, all bonds saw gains. However, due to the talk of a five-yuan limit, those watching the future must be cautious. As a result of the ups and downs of each bond, the Class A bonds only rose by one dime. Classes B and C have already seen a high price of five yuan, each up one yuan and one dime. Classes D and E also rose by about one yuan. The turnover was about four million yuan. A list is provided below.

### Wing On Textile Mill Shares Reach 1,450 Yuan

Yesterday, the Chinese stock market rapidly advanced towards its peak. Investors surged like wind and clouds, a sight not seen in nearly two months. Those holding stocks raised prices and refused to let go, while those seeking to acquire them did not hesitate to pay high prices. Although there was a slight pullback near noon, it did fall back, but it still mostly closed at the highest price in the trading momentum. It is rare for textile stocks to only rise and not fall back. Wing On Textile Mill rose by another hundred and several tens of yuan, reaching a highest traded price of one thousand four hundred and fifty yuan. Hung Sang Weaving reached nine and a half yuan. Great China Weaving rose by two dimes and a half. Shanghai Cotton and Wool rose to fourteen yuan. Foo Chang Dyeing and Weaving also rose by half a yuan. In the department store industry, Wing On Company rose the most, up nine yuan to one hundred and fifteen yuan. Sincere and China National Goods each rose by four or five yuan. Underwear also jumped by one yuan, with thirty-three yuan and seventy-five cents being the last traded price. In the new pharmaceutical industry, Sun-Ya Pharmaceutical Factory rose by another yuan, with forty-seven yuan being the most frequently traded price. Sino-French Friendship was stable, rising by one and a half yuan to one yuan. In the public utilities industry, Zhabei Water and Electricity and China Merchants Electric Power each rose by five cents, the former at thirty-seven yuan and the latter at thirty-two yuan. The cultural industry still had the weakest trading momentum, with only World Book Company rising by two and a half yuan. Commercial Press and Chung Hwa remained flat. Great China Matches soared by seven and a half yuan, rising close to the two hundred yuan mark. According to the speculation of people from all sides, the previous upward trend has changed to a flat trend. New investors have already seen high prices and sold, offsetting the gains. Today, the price list of each stock market is recorded below.

### Gilded Jewelry Market

All buyers should also pay attention.

### Sweet Potato Noodles Easy to Rise, Difficult to Fall

Yesterday, the supply and demand for beans were flat. The market first loosened slightly due to late sales by floating households, but then strengthened due to weak sellers. It is estimated that there were sixty packages of Tianjin red beans, priced at one hundred and sixty-seven yuan, and ten packages of Chongming sandy red beans, priced at one hundred and sixty-one yuan.

Corn street sales were not weak, and the market continued to be firm. It is estimated that one truckload of Nanjing corn was delivered in the South City, priced at one hundred and twenty-three yuan, and one truckload of Wuhu corn, priced at one hundred and seventeen yuan.

Although the arrival of sweet potato noodles was considered not deserted, the actual sales were particularly strong, so the market presented a trend of easy to rise and difficult to lower. Yesterday, forty packages of Qingdao sweet potato noodles were opened, priced at one hundred and thirty-eight yuan, delivered in sacks, and sixty packages of Jiangbei sweet potato noodles in straw bags, priced at one hundred and nineteen yuan to one hundred and eighteen yuan.

### Sugar Shares Can Issue Additional Profits; Prices Then Turn Upward

The opening price of brown sugar shares was three hundred yuan, and the closing price was three hundred and zero yuan. The total turnover was more than two thousand bags.

Retail prices are sold uniformly according to the price limit list approved by the Association authorities.

### Western Suit Flannel is Strong

Western suit flannel has been very strong these days. The market and wholesale prices are all below the price limit.

The various colors of Chinese-character and non-Chinese-character Western suit flannels of Yihe, Hongkang, Yongxing, Shanghai, Zhanghua, Yuanfeng, Dahua, Daguangming, Yinfeng, Runfeng, Deda, Xiexin, Dalong, Dalu, Hualun, and Weiyi, in yuan, Tibetan, gray, brown, green, herringbone grid stripes, are also trending upward.

### Bean Vermicelli Opening Price is High

Recently, the consumption of Longkou thread bean vermicelli has increased in various regions, and experts who specialize in it have also been purchasing, so the price has risen frequently. Therefore, the opening price has exceeded the trading range. The opening price of Longkou brand vermicelli is six hundred and thirty yuan, rising by fifty yuan before and after, but the trading range has not yet reached it, but there is no hope of loosening.

### Cigarettes Show Signs of Tightening

The cigarette market has been trending down for several days due to sluggish sales and the continued distribution of British and American goods. People are in a state of anxiety.

### Manager of Huatong Carbon Paper Factory Accused of Embezzlement

In April of this year, Qian Qitai, Cao Ding, and Nong Hua jointly established the Huatong Carbon Paper Factory at No. 17 Denian New Village, Old Bazizi Road. Qian Qitai was immediately elected as manager. Since the business started on May 15th, Qian Qitai actually did not include Wu Nonghua's share capital of 5,000 yuan in the shareholder register. In addition, Wu entrusted the factory to sell goods worth several thousand yuan. Whether or not they have been sold, the accounts have not been handed over. Wu had no choice but to first file a lawsuit with the Civil Court for the handover of accounts. After the account book copy was handed over in court, it was discovered that there were numerous malpractices. Wu immediately filed a criminal self-accusation. The trial was held a few days ago, and Qian was released on bail pending trial on the grounds of serious criminal suspicion.

West Committee members Di Fei, Fu Liutuo, Fei Ximen, and Chinese Committee members Chen Linsheng, Chuan Guiqing, etc. were present.

First, the chairman reported the significance of convening the standing committee, and discussed the steps to restore the organization, and to jointly promote table tennis in this city with the Shanghai Table Tennis Association. Then, Di Fei reported on last year's financial situation.

Performing Arts

### Xi Suqiu and Sheng Zhang Collaborate

— Xu Muyun

This time, the Golden Theatre invited Wu Suqiu, a talented student from the Peking Opera School, and Ye Shengzhang, the young leader of the Fu Sucheng Society, to collaborate in a performance. Ten years ago, when I lived in the old capital, I was responsible for supervising and guiding the school and society. Moreover, when the two students were studying at the school, I often visited the school, and during the performance period, I went to listen every day and night. Therefore, the day after arriving in Shanghai, they came to visit me. I recalled that when they were still studying, whenever it was the day to perform the main show, the president would specially reward them with two large coins (i.e., four copper coins) to fill their snack money. Those who received it were overjoyed. Now, in the blink of an eye, their salaries are each earning more than 100,000. As the saying goes, the world is nothing but a play. It is especially known that the changes in the drama world are so amazing, and the progress is so rapid, that even the fleeting clouds cannot be compared. Moreover, in the past ten years, the two of them have grown from young to strong, while I have come south and co-founded the China Opera School with Mr. Li Songling, spending my days with children, rejuvenating myself and becoming an old child again. How can I not sigh!

Although Suqiu is from Shandong (Penglai origin), her makeup is charming, lively and innocent, and she is indeed a rare talent among the rising female actors. Her singing and acting are excellent, especially in Xun-style opera. She is proficient in many plays. Her several visits to the south have all won her high praise. This collaboration with Shengzhang and the performance of many female lead plays is even more mutually beneficial. Shengzhang's martial clown can be said to have no peer in the north or south. Seniors such as Wang Changlin and Chuan Xiaoshan have personally given him guidance. Therefore, his performance of the teacher in "Stealing Hooks", "Beating Melon Garden", "Stealing Armor", and "Celebrating Top Pearl", his recitation, expressions, gestures, and martial arts all possess the classic style of the older generation, reminiscent of Wang Shuanzi in those years. His performances in "Stealing Armor", "Lying Chicken", and "Stealing Silver Pot" are also based on different masters and are truly the works of those in the martial clown profession. At a time when there is a lack of talent in the drama world, among those who open their mouths and jump, only Shengzhang and Shiju are the only two or three people left. Fortunately, Shengzhang is doing well, and I hope that he can pass on what he has learned to the younger students, so that the unique skills of the Wang and Chuan elders will not become a Guangling San.

### What I Saw of Li Nansha

— A Jin

On the mysterious green lane of Yuyuan Road in the western district, one can often meet an old man with silver hair. He seems to be over seventy years old, but his spirit is very strong. His pace is not very slow when he walks. He wears old glasses on his nose. When he sees people, he always smiles kindly and reaches out his hand to shake hands with people first. Sometimes he carries several books and a blanket in his hand, with the aim of going to the park to spend his reading life. Who is this old man? He is Mr. Li Junpan, the author of the new film "Roses Everywhere".

That day, a reporter went to visit him at his home. Director Fang Peilin was also present. They were discussing the story and layout of "Roses Everywhere". Later, the reporter also casually pulled over the script and flipped through it, only to see red lines crisscrossing it, all the opinions provided by various playwrights and directors. Yes, the achievement of a work is not a matter of chance but the crystallization of hard work.

He is not only a playwright but also a group of "old stars" on the silver screen. I remember that in the film "The Goddess", in which he co-starred with Ruan Lingyu, he played an "old principal." For the issue of a "goddess" child's reading qualification, his unique style of speaking out righteously is still deeply imprinted in people's minds.

His private life is very frugal. He has been a vegetarian for more than ten years. He proudly tells people: the rise in prices has not had much impact on me. A piece of fermented bean curd that costs four cents is my delicious side dish for the day. I am happy for him that he still has a very lively beloved daughter accompanying him in his old age, so his life is not lonely. However, his beloved daughter is not a girl who sits deep in her boudoir. I heard that she is a bookkeeper at a certain company.

Tan Fuying and Liang Xiaoluan Formally Collaborate

Song Baoluo and Zi Ping Hong Sweep Suzhou and Wuxi

A Grand Private Performance Is Coming to the City

Wang Yurong's Farewell Talks in the Old Capital

Tan Fuying was hired by the Tianjin China Grand Theatre, and Liang Xiaoluan, a second-line female lead who has become a force of her own, was hired to play the female roles. In addition to the original Yang Shengchun, Ha Baoshan, Gao Weilian, Ji Yanhua, Wang Quankui, and Liu Yanting, Xiao Changhua, the King of Clowns, was also hired to join the collaboration. The completeness of the lineup can be called invincible. Yesterday, Xiaoluan sent me a letter reporting on the general situation of the collaboration with Fuying. Excerpts of the main points are as follows: "Last month, the Tianjin China Grand Theatre invited Tan Fuying, and the female lead insisted on inviting me to cooperate with him. After I contacted Boss Tan several times, it was decided on the 5th of this month. It is now set to go to Tianjin on the 7th and take the stage on the 8th. The first day will be a performance of Visiting Mother Pot Ling, and the second day I will sing 'Spring and Autumn Match', with Gao Weilian and Xiao Changhua accompanying. The third day I will sing 'Yutang Chun', with Gao Weilian and Ha Maishan accompanying. The three days of continuous performances were decided in Beijing. I will send another letter to report on the subsequent programs and performances."

Song Baoluo and Zi Ping, siblings, have been performing at the Suzhou Dongwu Grand Theatre for a month, and their popularity is increasing. In the last few nights before departing, Master Jin happened to be a guest and was invited to be a guest of honor, a temporary lucky encounter. The Song siblings' performances in Suzhou were very popular, especially the nights before departing, with "Crying at the Qin Court" and "Emperor Tang Minghuang Crying for Yang Guifei" being the best. The term ended on the 9th, and on the 10th they went to Wuxi for a performance at the "Jincheng Grand Theatre", scheduled for ten days. After the term expires, they will return to Gusu, because the "Kaiming Grand Theatre" in the city has an early agreement, so they must return to Suzhou for a trip.

On the 19th of this month, there will be a surprising grand private performance in this city. Wu Suqiu, Song Dezhui, Ye Shengzhang, Li Yuzhi, Wang Yurong, Li Hezeng, Wang Jinlu, Yu Zhenfei, Cao Huilin, Li Huifang, Wang Yurang, Zhu Chuanming, Zhang Chuanfang, Zheng Chuanjian, Ci Shaoquan, and Liu Binkun are being recruited. The repertoire has been drafted and will be announced soon. The location of the performance, the event sponsor requested to be kept secret, so it is omitted.

Wang Yurong was hired by "Empress" and will come to Shanghai soon. Before leaving, she made a brief statement to the newspapers in the old capital, which roughly meant: "Recently, there are four major theaters in Shanghai competing to perform old plays. The roles invited by each theater are all famous figures of the time. My art is not of the highest quality, but I have also participated in it. I can't help but feel both happy and afraid. I am happy to take this opportunity to revisit the old place, but I am afraid that so many famous actors gathering in one place will make it difficult to sell tickets. But since I have accepted the invitation, fear is useless. I can only move forward bravely, boldly do it, and do my best to contribute to the audience of all of Shanghai. I will not be lazy, I will not be afraid, I will not cut corners, and I will sing my play with the utmost sincerity, not seeking merit, but seeking no fault." According to Yurong, she is a proud disciple of Wang Yaoqing and has always been known as the Golden Voice Qingyi. Her popular records of "The Entire Fourth Son Visiting His Mother" and "The Entire Wujiapo" have long been popular. This time, her return to her hometown, the high praise she receives can be predicted. Moreover, Zhou Xiaotian, Wu Yanheng, Guan Shengji and other roles are all excellent talents, and with the help of capable people, it will definitely have the effect of flowers and leaves shining each other. Yurong's words are just humble remarks. I know that when she leads the team south, she will definitely be happy and proud.

### A Tour of Shanghai's Storytelling Theaters

— Jianfan

Oriental Theater

The Oriental Theater, attached to the Oriental Hotel, has a history of about twenty years. The hired storyteller, Qiang Niu, is a top-notch talent with outstanding storytelling skills, so his career has never declined. A year after the war, due to the large audience, a second theater was opened on the second floor, which was later changed to perform local opera. Now only the first theater downstairs remains, but it has been rebuilt into a small theater, with a seating capacity of about eight hundred. There was a time when the evening performances were dedicated to spoken drama. From this year on, the evening performances are purely storytelling again. Taking advantage of the empty period in the evening, adding a midday performance between the daytime and evening performances was also first pioneered by the Oriental Theater. Furthermore, regarding the facilities of the storytelling theater, apart from the few newly opened modern storytelling theaters, the Oriental Theater is undoubtedly the best. The seating is similar to that of a first-run movie theater, with leather cushions in winter and mats in summer, making it very comfortable and quiet. However, sometimes the faint sound of gongs and drums from the second theater upstairs can disturb the hearing, and there is no way to avoid it. The current lineup includes Cao Ren'an in the morning, telling stories about the kingdoms and Japan. He once used the pen name "Basic Storytelling" to write a piece in this newspaper titled "Why Do I Want to Tell the Romance of the Three Kingdoms?" He is very knowledgeable, speaks elegantly, and is very popular with customers who enjoy morning tea. In the afternoon, Huang Zhaolin tells Three Kingdoms stories, Yan Xueting tells Strange Wrongs Recorded, Xu Jixiang tells Heroic Righteousness, and Zhang Shaochan tells Changing Pearl Phoenix. For the midday performance, Zhou Yuquan tells Jade Dragonfly, Shen Jian'an and Lü Yi'an tell Pearl Pagoda, Xia Hesheng tells Three Smiles, and Tang Fengchun tells Wobo. For the evening performance, Xu Tianxiang specializes in singing opening pieces, Xia Hesheng tells Gilded Phoenix, Zhang Hongsheng tells Heroic Martyrs, and Yu Xiaoyun tells Xiao Xia's Legend of the White Snake. With such a grand lineup, the theater is naturally always full!

### Sharing the Same Boat Through Storms

— He Jia Zhi

(9) Human Hell

Wei Yunqing said angrily, "First you said someone would come at dawn to take Miss Bian away, and now you say it's in the middle of the night. Is it dawn or midnight? "Cao Ma shook her head and said, "That, I don't remember clearly." Wei Yunqing was bursting with anger and said, "A person who has come to my house will be snatched away by others. If I say it, people will laugh their heads off. None of you are giving me any face, see if I will spare you." Wei Yunqing gritted his teeth, his teeth creaking, nodded to Cao Yan, and then nodded to Mrs. Qi; he said, "Hey! Fei Changhe's woman, you say, if you don't let Miss Bian go easily, then it's none of your business. You have a daughter. If you let Miss Bian go, I will take your child to be a maid to replace Miss Bian." As soon as Mrs. Qi heard this, she immediately knelt down to Wei Yunqing and kowtowed several times, saying, "Thank you, Master Wei, thank you, Master Wei. If Master Wei is willing to take our Aqiao into the house as a maid, then I am Master Wei's mother-in-law. I have suffered with Fei Changhe for a lifetime. If one day I rely on Aqiao to become the master's mother-in-law, then I will wake up laughing in my dreams. Master Wei, I will kowtow to you a few more times, begging Master Wei not to go back on his word." As she spoke, she kowtowed to Wei Yunqing several more times.

Wei Yunqing said, "Fei Changhe's woman, don't talk nonsense, who wants your daughter? I have the good fortune to marry a concubine, your daughter doesn't have the good fortune to be a wife. Get up! Do you think staying on the ground will lessen your guilt?" But Mrs. Qi refused to get up. At first, she was smiling and talking, but now she had a bitter face and was weeping. Wei Yunqing stroked his beard and instructed Cao Ma and A Si to pull Mrs. Qi up. Mrs. Qi got up, lifted her trousers to take a look, and there was an abacus bead embedded in her knee. When she lifted her trousers, the abacus bead fell out, but it had already left a deep pit. She was obsessed with becoming the master's mother-in-law, so she didn't even know that the abacus bead was embedded in her flesh. (179)
