### Strong Defense of Stalingrad, Fierce Fighting Continues, Soviet Forces Launch Tank Assault in Several Areas Near Rzhev

Berlin, Allied News Agency, 31st – According to an announcement from the German High Command, one week after General Bock's mechanized units attacked Stalingrad, the vanguard of their pincer movement was only fifteen miles away from this industrial city on the Volga River. At the same time, the German Air Force was exerting all its strength to bomb Stalingrad, causing numerous fires and extensive damage within the city. As for the area near Rzhev, 130 miles northwest of Moscow, the Red Army launched attacks in several locations with strong forces of tanks and infantry but encountered fierce German resistance, destroying 45 Soviet tanks.

Stockholm, Havas News Agency, 31st – The third year of the European war has ended, and the battle for Stalingrad is raging fiercely, attracting global attention. The situation in this battle is as significant as the battle for Leningrad a year ago. Although the German army's attack on this Volga city is fierce, the Soviet forces seem to be holding firm and, it is claimed, have improved their defenses in several locations. Yesterday, German forces penetrated the outer defense line of Stalingrad, but the location of the penetration was not specified, presumably in the west of Stalingrad. As for the northwest and western areas of the city, the German offensive has slowed down slightly.

German Supreme Headquarters, Huitong News Agency, 31st – This afternoon's German war report stated that the German-Romanian forces continued to advance south of the Lower Kupen River, forcing the enemy to retreat towards the Black Sea coast. Anti-aircraft guns sank a Soviet gunboat. Enemy positions south of Stalingrad have been breached by our forces, and German troops have now reached a certain stronghold south of the city, only 25 kilometers away. The railway and airfield east of the Volga River are constantly bombed by our aircraft. Fierce fighting broke out as Soviet forces attacked our positions near Rzhev, and four Soviet tanks were destroyed by our forces. The Soviet offensive south of Lake Ladoga also failed. On the 14th, Italian fast boats sank a Soviet gunboat and a merchant ship each in Lake Ladoga.

Berlin, Huitong News Agency, 31st – German military figures recently commented on the German army's breakthrough of the outer defense line of Stalingrad, stating that although the fighting has not yet occurred within the city, the situation in Stalingrad has now entered a decisive stage. The outer defense line is approximately 30 to 50 kilometers away from the city. Although the enemy is putting up stubborn resistance, the situation in the city is becoming increasingly serious. Regarding the Caucasus front, while the German side has not disclosed the progress of German forces, it has also not denied the locations reported by the Soviet side as having been reached by German forces.

Berlin, Huitong News Agency, 31st – The German High Command announced last night that German infantry and mechanized units have broken through the strong Soviet defensive fortifications around Stalingrad and penetrated deep into them. The terrain around the city is treacherous, and the defending forces use it as a natural barrier. In addition, the Soviet side has deployed multiple defense lines around the city, so the entire defensive structure is up to 30 kilometers deep. The fortifications are mostly built according to the terrain and can be called a first-class fortress. Although the Soviet forces are holding firm based on the dangerous terrain, they have still failed to stop the German advance. The enemy suffered heavy losses, and the German army captured a considerable number of prisoners and war spoils.

Berlin, Huitong News Agency, 31st – Since the German army broke through the defense line of Stalingrad yesterday, the fighting has intensified. In addition to infantry, the German army also has mechanized units assisting in the battle, so the German threat has significantly increased. The news that the headquarters of a certain Soviet division was suddenly occupied by the German army has been confirmed. German bombers fiercely attacked Soviet bunkers during the week, opening up a major road for ground troops. The task of the German Air Force yesterday was to prevent Soviet counterattacks. When German aircraft attacked enemy tank concentration areas, they destroyed thirteen tanks. Timoshenko's mechanized units, which were used to impede the German advance, have been defeated. The German command believes that the capture of Stalingrad will still require a considerable amount of time and a large number of troops for two reasons: 1. The defensive circle of the city is up to 30 kilometers deep. 2. The Soviet forces have used the terrain to build strong fortresses. Berlin's well-informed sources remain tight-lipped about the Caucasus front, which does not mean that the German offensive has not made progress. Other information about the names of the mountain passes occupied by the Axis powers and the distance of Axis forces to Oktyabrsky and Grozny has not been released. However, one thing is certain: the Axis advance towards the Black Sea is still continuing. The difficulties encountered by the Axis forces in the forests of the western Caucasus must first be overcome before they can occupy Anapa, Novorossiysk, and Tuapse. The stubborn resistance of the Soviet forces is only enough to delay the fall of these ports. The offensive launched by General Chuikov in the central sector of the Eastern Front has been contained. Judging from the heavy losses suffered by the Soviet forces in Kaluga and Rzhev, it can be said that the Soviet offensive in that area has failed. Soviet forces continue to attack between Lake Ladoga and Volkhov, and fierce fighting is currently taking place on the single-track railway line in that area.

Berlin, Havas News Agency, 30th – Soviet reports that their troops had broken through German defense lines in the Rzhev area have been denied by military circles here. It is claimed that the German army in the central and northern sectors of the Eastern Front has remained on the defensive in recent days. On August 28th, Soviet troops launched several counterattacks west of Kaluga, north of Metyatino, and near Rzhev, but were repelled. Twenty-one Soviet tanks were destroyed. On the night of the 28th, Soviet troops again launched a fierce attack with heavy artillery bombardment, followed by a large number of tanks. However, they were again stopped by German defensive artillery fire, and the Red Army suffered extremely heavy losses. However, in one location, a Red Army unit crossed a small river and invaded a German base. The German army immediately counterattacked, destroying eight of their tanks, and the Red Army was driven back to its original defense line. In addition, another Red Army attempted to cross the upper reaches of the Volga River, and several tanks were destroyed by German aircraft. As for the enemy in the northern sector, they launched several local counterattacks near the southern shore of Lake Ilmen and the stronghold at the head of the Volkhov River but were repelled, and five tanks were destroyed by our army. Our army counterattacked south of Lake Ladoga and repelled those approaching our defense line. Our aircraft fiercely bombed enemy defense areas and their artillery positions.

### Unsuccessful British Landing on New Britain Island, Submarine Sunk, Landing Party Captured

Rabaul, New Britain Island, Allied News Agency, 31st – The British-Australian side previously attempted to use a submarine to transport a small number of naval units to land on New Britain Island at night. The submarine has been sunk, and the landing attempt has failed. The landed units have been captured by the Japanese Navy. When the enemy landed, they carried a short-wave wireless radio with strong power to report to headquarters. The telephone lines on the island that were destroyed will be repaired by September 1st.

### Roosevelt to Deliver Speech Today

Washington, Havas News Agency, 31st – President Roosevelt is scheduled to deliver three consecutive speeches tomorrow and on the 3rd and 9th of next month. This is an unprecedented arrangement. It is believed that the President has been silent for quite some time, and the public believes that he knows that there is a need to quickly explain some issues that can stir up emotions. Because in some aspects, there has been a kind of dissatisfaction recently, and the opposition party is taking advantage of this opportunity to strengthen their position, the danger of which is very significant. In general, the President will discuss four issues in these three speeches: 1. Control of wages and agricultural product prices; 2. Tax plans; 3. New consumption restriction measures; 4. Mobilization matters. Regarding the first item, the control of prices and wages is closely related to the increase or decrease in the cost of living. The government has repeatedly studied this issue for several months. Regarding the second item, the American people constantly hear government exhortations to support the heavy national treasury burden of the coming year, but the authorities have not yet provided concrete guidance on the tax items. Regarding the third item, the so-called new consumption restriction measures probably include a weekly ban on eating meat for one day. The President mentioned this matter when he received reporters the other day. As for the fourth item, military circles believe that young people aged 18 to 20 will be rapidly mobilized. Until now, this step has been shelved and not implemented. It is expected that the President will not intensify implementation before the congressional elections next month of this year, but due to military needs, the authorities will have no choice but to call up reservists, and even married people and parents will be hard to spare. Regarding this matter, the President will surely call on all Americans to stop infighting and unite in several future speeches in order to cope with the current international situation.

Lisbon, Huitong News Agency, 31st – Washington dispatch: President Roosevelt will deliver a speech on Labor Day, September 7th, announcing measures to prevent inflation and adjusting wages and prices required under the current situation.

### Soviet Aircraft Bomb Germany, British Aircraft Also Attack Germany, France, and Belgium

Lisbon, Allied News Agency, 31st – Moscow Radio announced last night that Soviet aircraft had bombed Berlin, Königsberg, Danzig, and Stettin last Saturday night, which was the second time in the past week. According to German news yesterday, Soviet aircraft flew over Greater Berlin, but due to accurate anti-aircraft fire, these aircraft flew very high, only dropping sporadic fierce bombs and incendiary bombs in the suburbs of Berlin, causing very little damage. As for the areas bombed by Soviet aircraft in eastern and northern Germany, the area was very wide, but there were no targets, and the damage was also minimal.

London, Havas News Agency, 31st – Officials announced that as a result of the Air Force's bombing of Germany last week, a total of fifteen aircraft were lost, and another crashed over the country.

Stockholm, Huitong News Agency, 31st – The Washington correspondent of the Swedish Evening News reported that the US government, in view of the people's excessive optimism about the war situation, issued a warning urging them not to ignore the various difficulties of the future. At the same time, it also pointed out that empty words cannot create victory, and emphasis must be placed on reality in order to have hope of success. In order to eliminate this excessive atmosphere of optimism, the authorities sometimes deliberately point out the difficulties in supply and production, and openly admit that production figures are still far from the original plan. The American newspapers also support the government's policy, stating that the victory of the US military on various fronts is only a small part of success and should not be overemphasized. At the same time, they warn readers to prepare for a long war.

### Tensions Rise in the Near East, Iranian Government Announces Martial Law to Facilitate Allied Military Deployment Within Its Borders, Prevent Any Attacks from the Caucasus

Istanbul, Havas News Agency, 30th – According to news from Tehran, the Iranian government announced martial law today. According to well-informed sources in the country, this move is a precautionary measure and does not mean that the domestic situation has become serious. The purpose of implementing martial law is threefold: 1. To facilitate the Allied military deployment within Iran to prevent any attacks from the Caucasus; 2. To prevent any pro-Axis rebellions against the government within the country; 3. To reduce the suppression of bandits by insurgents to protect the safety of residents' lives and property.

Ankara, Huitong News Agency, 31st – Recently received a dispatch from Cairo stating that there has been talk of the Allies opening a second front in the Near East after the Moscow Conference. Judging from the activities of British and American military leaders and political representatives in the Near East, the statement is particularly credible. 1. General Stone has consulted with the Egyptian Chief of Staff many times, and the main issue discussed seems to be the intention to deploy the Egyptian army in the Near East. 2. The Syrian government has decided to establish a 5,000-strong National Guard, trained by officers under General Catroux. 3. The regular army of Iraq has been incorporated into the British, Indian, and American troops stationed in northeastern Iraq. Recently, Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Said has repeatedly stated that if the Caucasus war expands to the vicinity of the Iraqi border, Iraq has the determination to declare war on the Axis powers. 4. News from the Iranian capital: The American military delegation there has reorganized the Iranian army into an elite force for wartime deployment. 5. Iraqi officials revealed that the shipment of military supplies through the port of Basra has recently increased, and the number of American troops landing has continued to increase. The American military mission in Syria is negotiating, and the US Air Force is attempting to take over part of the Syrian airfield. Many American troops and military engineers have arrived in Syria. 6. The British and American military missions have newly arrived in Tbilisi and secretly discussed important matters with Soviet military leaders. In summary, it can be seen that the Near East is on the verge of a storm.

London, Havas News Agency, 30th – The Under-Secretary of the Navy, Hall, declared here today that there is no doubt that the second front will be opened in Europe. As for when it will be opened and where the battlefield will be, it cannot be predicted at present. The various guarantees put forward by the British government can satisfy Stalin and should also be acceptable to the people of our country. Therefore, the opening of the second front is only a matter of time. At present, only the Communist Party and a part of the people who do not understand the truth are still dissatisfied and insist on immediately opening the second front, which is a mistake.

Stockholm, Huitong News Agency, 31st – The British Naval Secretary, Hall, said yesterday that some people believe that the second war front can be opened soon, which is extremely ignorant.

Istanbul, Huitong News Agency, 31st – A dispatch from Tehran states that the situation in the Soviet-occupied area of Iran is becoming tense. Several British staff officers have arrived in Tabriz City in recent days. Soviet and Iranian troops patrol the streets day and night, and the roads used by Soviet military convoys are heavily guarded. The Soviet transportation team has troops on board who can shoot at suspects at any time.

### Second Anniversary of French Veterans' Association, Pétain Delivers Speech Encouraging Loyalty to the Motherland

Clermont-Ferrand, France, Havas News Agency, 30th – Marshal Pétain recently took advantage of the second anniversary of the Veterans' Association to deliver a speech, saying, "Veterans, on the occasion of the second anniversary of the establishment of this association, I would like to share with you my confidence and passion. I was born in this land, so I never forget to love my country. Your difficult situation is like our nation, and your spirit of resolutely encouraging yourself is like our country. Although you wear military uniforms yesterday and civilian clothes today, you are always ready to be loyal to your motherland, obey discipline, relieve poverty, and promote truth. These are your daily duties. Today, our country must implement constructive policies, practice the slogan of national revolution, organize a sound and free government, abide by systematic occupations, and support the family system to enable everyone to live and work in peace. The labor law and farmers' associations have already made important reforms, but there are still some obstacles in practice. And some nationals yearn for the comfortable life of the past, lingering and not forgetting him, such as frustrated congressmen, selfish businessmen, and defeated merchants who are not hostile to the government. At least they take a negative attitude, so I would like to say a word to you, that is, our country's history has changed a page, the past is gone, and in the future, we must implement unity with fortitude, loyalty, and patience. This is the way to save the country, and it is also what the government's top leader, Laval, is determined to carry out to the end. Our national revolution, regardless of all difficulties, after the defeat and fragmentation of the previous government, cuts through thorns and thistles to create a new France, raising its head proudly in the world. I take this opportunity to express my hope, because my previous speeches to persuade the people have gradually taken effect. For example, the selfish and greedy have gradually disappeared. I have been given the important task of the country to revive the country, and I am deeply determined. I hope you will actively support it, then our prisoners of war and the people of the country will be able to admire your spirit. Veterans, you should do your sacred duty every day to restrain yourself, this is the way to save the country."

Clermont-Ferrand, France, Havas News Agency, 30th – A group of French veterans took public buses to this place today to participate in the second anniversary ceremony of the Veterans' Association. On the way, the bus suddenly overturned, killing one person on the spot, seriously injuring five people, and slightly injuring several people. The local authorities immediately reported to Marshal Petain after the incident.

### Sentences Reduced for Five Northern Irish Youths

Stockholm, Huitong News Agency, 31st – According to news from Belfast last night, the Duke of Abercorn, the Governor-General of Northern Ireland, ordered the reduction of the death sentences of five of the six Irish youths who were sentenced to death for killing a British policeman. Among them, one person's sentence was reduced to life imprisonment, and another person's sentence was changed to fifteen years' imprisonment. The Governor-General's action was the result of a petition from the British people to the British authorities, especially the Irish Republican Army's request to the Governor-General. The names of those who were not reduced in sentence have not been announced, and all the people of Ireland are paying close attention to see if the British authorities dare to carry out the death sentence. The oldest of the six Northern Irish youths is no more than twenty-two years old. They were sentenced to death by the Ulster Supreme Court for killing a policeman in Belfast. The death sentence was scheduled to be carried out on September 3rd. During the interrogation, the defendant's lawyer argued that the case was not premeditated murder, so even if only one of the six people was executed, it would give the Irish people a bad impression.

### Japan to Establish Company to Capture Sea Otters

Tokyo, 31st (Central News Agency) Sea otters, which live in the North Pacific, have been protected by a treaty signed in 1911 by Japan, the United States, the Soviet Union, and Canada. For the past thirty years, capture has been restricted. Experts estimate that there are now about 2.5 million sea otters. The protection treaty expired last October and was abolished. The Japanese Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry plans to begin capturing sea otters this winter and has already planned to establish a sea animal stock company to manage this. The estimated capital is 3 million yen. They are currently consulting with relevant parties in preparation, and the company should be established by the end of October at the latest, and set sail to capture sea otters by the end of November. The area will be the seas around the Kuril Islands, the Kamchatka Peninsula, and the Sea of Okhotsk. The annual quota for capture is 15,000 sea otters, plus several thousand other sea lions and seals. It is estimated that 3 million kilograms of meat can be obtained. Sea otter meat is said to be similar to whale meat and quite delicious, and is the best nutritious food for winter. It is expected to be available in Tokyo by early December, with the price set at 12 sen per kilogram. Sea otter fur is also a high-quality item for keeping warm in winter.

### Egypt Considering Expanding Martial Law

Cairo, 30th (Havas) According to an official announcement, due to the recent enemy air raids on cities in northern and southern Egypt, the Ministry of Interior is considering extending the current martial law to the entire country.

Cairo, 30th (Havas) The British Middle East Command announced today that enemy reconnaissance troops fired on British troops in the central area near El Alamein, Egypt, with machine guns on the night of the 28th of this month. There were no battles yesterday, and there was little air force activity.

Berlin, 31st (Haitong News Agency) In the third year of the German war, the achievements are significant, and the goal of victory is getting closer. The German victory in southern Russia destroyed the cornerstone of Soviet war industry. Although the production of North American munitions will be higher next year, Germany and its allies firmly believe that the United States cannot prevent the collapse of British and Soviet forces. Germany will point out the following reasons to prove the correctness of this belief: German forces have sunk enemy ships totaling 23.1 million tons, which is about one-third of the world's total merchant tonnage on September 1, 1939. Even if Britain and the United States can produce large quantities of munitions, they cannot be transported to Europe, so what is the use of having more? German forces have occupied a vast area of the Soviet Union, and Japanese forces have occupied some islands in Southeast Asia, making economic resources more abundant than before. Furthermore, looking at the expansion of the war zone, the achievements of the German forces are increasing, and the situation is getting better and better. A. Japan's entry into the war last year not only defeated the British and American fleets and occupied Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaya, Borneo, and other places, but also caused significant losses to Britain in terms of resources. For example, 92% of the world's rubber production and 60% of tin production are now in the hands of the Japanese. B. Malta has been severely bombed by German planes and is no longer an important base for the air force and navy. C. Tobruk has been occupied by Axis forces and is now only 60 miles from Alexandria. D. Control of the Mediterranean has fallen into the hands of the Axis powers. E. The Soviet Union has lost 1.5 million square kilometers of territory. F. The Soviet Union has lost half of its national population. British air raids on Germany have not had a significant effect, and the German people have not suffered significant economic or psychological impact. In summary, as the fourth year of Germany's participation in the war begins, everything presents an optimistic outlook.

### Reaffirming Price Restriction Notice, Strictly Controlling Prices, Severe Punishment for Merchants Who Violate

Mr. Okazaki Katsuo, Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council, issued a public notice on the matter of price controls. The text is recorded below: "In order to control prices within the Settlement and stabilize people's livelihoods, this Council previously issued Public Notices No. 5948 and 5983 on June 15th and 30th of this year, respectively, which stipulated regulations regarding the retail prices of all goods. The purpose of issuing the above notices is, on the one hand, to prevent the sharp rise in prices and thereby protect the interests of the citizens, and on the other hand, to allow legitimate merchants to submit sufficient reasons to the Council to increase their prices so that they do not experience hardship. Therefore, all merchants within the Settlement should fully cooperate with the Council for their own benefit. This Council hopes that merchants will voluntarily comply with all notices issued regarding price controls, as this is the Council's consistent policy. However, if there are merchants who do not understand the meaning of these notices and violate the regulations without authorization, which affects the living conditions of the citizens, then the security of the Concession will be greatly affected. For the sake of public interest, this Council will have to take severe measures against such illegal merchants. Regarding the matter of price controls, the Japanese Army and Navy authorities also issued a joint public notice today, expressing the hope that all merchants will fully understand the intentions of the authorities and will not violate the regulations. At the same time, this Council hopes that citizens will also fully understand the intentions of the authorities and will not engage in hoarding, so as to avoid causing unreasonable price increases."

Previous Notices Canceled

The contents of the previously issued Public Notices No. 5948 and 5983 are as follows: Public Notice No. 5948 states in brief, "This Council hereby cancels Public Notices No. 5596, 5611, 5627, and 5737, which were previously issued regarding price limits on general goods. From June 17th of this year, the retail prices of all goods sold in the Public Concession, regardless of their nature or type, shall be calculated in New Legal Tender. The retail prices calculated in New Legal Tender shall not exceed 150% of the average prices calculated in Old Legal Tender between May 26th and 28th of this year. Without the approval of this Council, no unauthorized increases beyond the above-mentioned limit shall be made. Applications for price increases should be submitted to the Price Control Office of this Council at No. 209 Jiangxi Road for review."

Violations Will Be Punished

The measures outlined in Section 2 of this notice do not apply to goods for which the Council has set price limits. The prices of these goods shall still be charged in accordance with the notices repeatedly issued by this Council.

If there is any refusal to comply with the measures stipulated in this notice, this Council will handle the matter in accordance with Section 53 of the Land Regulations or Public Notice No. 5798 of this Council.

Public Notice No. 5983 states in brief, "The retail prices of all goods sold in the Public Concession, regardless of their nature or type, which have been converted to New Legal Tender on or before May 26th of this year, shall not be increased without authorization after May 26th of this year, without the approval of this Council. Violators will be punished in accordance with Section 53 of the Land Regulations or Public Notice No. 5798."

Mr. Faber Publishes Statement

Lieutenant Colonel Faber, Commissioner of the French Concession Police, made a statement regarding the price control oath. The French authorities, in order to control the prices of various goods and stabilize the lives of residents, issued two notices on June 15th and 30th, 1942, regarding the retail prices of various goods. The purpose of these notices is to prevent the rapid rise in prices in order to maintain the welfare of the residents. However, in order to avoid causing undue losses to legitimate merchants, the authorities will allow them to increase prices if they can provide legitimate reasons. Therefore, for the benefit of the merchants within the Concession, they should comply with these regulations and fully cooperate with the authorities. The policy of the French authorities has always been to seek good faith compliance with the price control notices from merchants. However, some merchants may not understand the intentions of the authorities and neglect to comply, which affects the lives of the residents, and the security and order within the Concession may be seriously affected. For the sake of public interest, the authorities currently find it necessary to severely punish such unscrupulous merchants. At the same time, the Japanese Army and Navy authorities have also issued similar declarations. Therefore, it is hoped that all merchants will fully understand the purpose of the authorities and will not test the law. In addition, this authority urges residents to pay attention and cooperate with the authorities, and not to engage in hoarding, so as to avoid unreasonable price increases. (The French authority notices of June 15th and 30th of this year are omitted.)

Japanese Statement

According to Domei News Agency, relevant Chinese and Japanese authorities consider it extremely important to stabilize commodity prices and improve the people's livelihood. The Japanese Consulate General has issued a notice stipulating measures for retail prices. The Xingya Yuan Central China Liaison Department and the Japanese Army and Navy authorities have also issued statements clarifying the authorities' comprehensive policies for controlling materials and prices in the future. At the same time, they hope that the general public will cooperate with the price control measures and work together. The contents of the notice and statement are excerpted below:

Notice from the Japanese Consulate General

"In accordance with Article 2 of the Regulations for the Suppression of Illegal Profits, stipulated by Consular Order No. 2 of Showa 17 (1942), the following regulations will be implemented regarding the retail prices of goods from September 1st: Retailers of goods shall not sell at prices exceeding the average prices between May 26th and 28th of this year, except in special circumstances where permission has been obtained from this Consulate General." The Japanese Consulate General authorities also issued a statement, earnestly hoping that all businesses and consumers will understand the importance of the current price control measures and take the lead in cooperating with the authorities' measures.

Statement from the Xingya Yuan

The statement from the Xingya Yuan can be divided into four points: 1. In response to the current situation of implementing currency unification, relevant agencies are closely cooperating and working together to establish comprehensive price control measures. 2. Central and local price control committees will be established at the central level and in necessary locations as joint Chinese-Japanese institutions. Chinese and Japanese agencies will work together to effectively unify price control. At the same time, given the special political and economic significance of Shanghai in Central China, the Shanghai Price Control Committee will be established separately. Relevant authorities and the Price Control Committee will closely coordinate to explore various price control measures. 3. Setting and maintaining appropriate prices. In the future, this authority will closely cooperate with various Chinese and Japanese departments to overcome any difficult situations. In addition to seeking to increase local production and promote its transportation, efforts will be made to secure resources from Japan and other areas within the Southern Co-Prosperity Sphere, so as to appropriately allocate Shanghai's and other local industries. Planning the expansion of local productivity, accelerating the establishment of distribution organizations, and rationalizing consumption are among the tasks. 4. The implementation of these measures is a major undertaking that directly affects the lives of the entire population and is of utmost importance to the well-being of the people. Therefore, regardless of whether one is engaged in the production, distribution, or consumption of goods, it is hoped that everyone will be aware of their responsibilities and cooperate with the policies of the relevant authorities to ensure the smooth progress of price control. (Note: This price control measure excludes the Hankou area, as local military and police authorities have their own measures. This is specially noted.)

Statement from the Army and Navy Authorities

Regarding price control measures in Central China, the Japanese Army and Navy authorities in this city issued a statement on the 31st, instructing on the policy of suppressing prices and hoping that the people of Central China will unanimously assist in the implementation. The statement briefly stated that, in light of the recent high prices of general goods in Central China, it is necessary to study appropriate measures for the stability of the people's livelihood. In order to smoothly carry out the current material control and currency unification, the authorities will suppress the rising prices in Central China and strive to maintain reasonable prices, thereby ensuring that the people can live and work in peace and that the maintenance of law and order is without regret. All residents of Central China, regardless of nationality, should unanimously assist the authorities' policies, thereby protecting their own lives and contributing to the Great East Asia War of Liberation.

### Postal Rates to Double Starting Today

The postage for all items in the first, second, fourth, and fifth categories will be subject to a temporary surcharge of 100% of the original rate, starting today. The increased postal items include ordinary letters, express letters, registered mail, ordinary express mail, postcards (single and double), books, newspapers, and trade contracts.

Charity Football Match

Father Wang Fang, Director of Physical Education at Xuhui Middle School, wrote: "We initiated a small-scale charity football match, specially inviting the strong Shanghai United Security Team to play against the Xuhui team on the 19th. Due to rain, the match could not be held, so it was postponed to the 28th. The first ticket sales totaled 491 yuan, which was sent to your committee on the 22nd. The second match was a make-up match, and the tickets sold for the first match were still valid, so only 18 five-yuan tickets were sold, totaling 90 yuan, and 187 one-yuan tickets were sold, totaling 187 yuan, bringing the total to 277 yuan. We are now sending the money for your receipt. I am very impressed by the great spirit with which your newspaper has organized scholarships in the past.

### Thorough Investigation of Wang's Family Situation

The Shen Bao Readers' Scholarship Fund strives to be strict and fair in its review of scholarship applications. However, we may not always have complete information. Therefore, when we receive letters from enthusiastic people pointing out that a certain student's family situation is acceptable and that a scholarship may not be needed, we conduct a thorough re-investigation to ensure that the donated funds are not used wastefully, even down to the last penny. We publish the lists of scholarship recipients in this newspaper every day. Recently, we received a letter from Mr. Liang, a reader, describing the family situation of Wang, an approved applicant. After our staff conducted a thorough investigation from all aspects and obtained proof that he meets the qualifications for a scholarship, the results did not match what was stated in the letter, and a fair person provided proof. Therefore, it has been decided to continue to approve the scholarship. This newspaper appreciates the generosity of the readers' donations and sympathizes with poor students. We also admire the enthusiasm of the readers who report cases and their concern for public welfare.

### Xu Daquan's Fratricide Case Sentenced to Death

Xu Songyao, the young owner of Huamei Pharmacy, was fatally injured by his younger brother Xu Daquan with an axe on October 21st of last year. After the incident, Daquan was arrested and investigated by the French police and sent to court for prosecution. After repeated trials, he was sentenced to ten years in prison, as reported in previous issues. We have learned that the prosecutor of the High Court Branch did not agree with the first-instance judgment and appealed against Xu Daquan. After repeated hearings, Daquan remained silent and bowed his head without a word. His defense lawyer, Zhao Xizhen, argued that after the previous judgment, the original prosecutor appealed, but the Criminal Court of the District Court rejected it due to procedural irregularities. The prosecutor did not file an appeal, and the police affairs office also withdrew its appeal. Therefore, this appeal trial clearly does not comply with the litigation procedures and the agreement for the establishment of Chinese courts. The appeal should be dismissed. The court declared the debate concluded and scheduled the judgment. The original judgment was revoked yesterday, and Xu Daquan was sentenced to death for murder, deprived of public rights for life. After the sentence was pronounced, Xu's defense lawyer declared in court that Xu did not accept the sentence and would appeal. The court approved the appeal and Xu was taken back into custody.

### Consistent Absorption by Buyers, Government Bonds Rise Slowly

Yesterday, the market for unified government bonds saw a slow upward trend with an unusually solid base. It seems that those who had been selling at high prices after many days of hovering realized the difficulty, while the demand from various parties maintained its consistent firmness, taking advantage of opportunities to raise prices. The activity of absorption was not as sluggish as in the previous few days. Therefore, most bonds opened at higher prices. Although there was a slight pullback later, due to continuous purchases by large investors, sellers ultimately gave in, and market prices gradually rose, eventually closing at high prices across the board. This shows that market sentiment still favors buyers, and the upward trend indicates a promising outlook for all bonds. However, if Category C bonds can stabilize above 40 yuan, the momentum will be more sustained. Otherwise, if they hover around 40 yuan, the momentum will be short-lived and may turn back before breaking through again. The most active buyers in the entire market were Hu Heji, Qianyi, Lanxin, Xie Kang, Tonghe, Runli, and Yuanhe, while Xinhua, Hengyu, Runde, Jiufeng, Lianhe, and Hongxing were selling. The net result of the price changes for all bonds was a uniform increase of 3.5 jiao. The trading volume was approximately 1.2 to 1.3 million yuan. A table is provided below:

### Fuchang New Shares Debut and Trading Begins

As for the old stocks, only Xinya Pharmaceutical Factory of Xin Pharmaceutical experienced a large purchase by a certain investor, rising from 43.25 yuan to 45 yuan, an increase of 1 yuan. Sino-French Minyi showed signs of fatigue, down 1.5 yuan and 1 yuan. The department store Xinxin Company rose to 104 yuan, eventually closing flat. Wing On retreated to below 100 yuan, down 4 yuan. Innerwear was down 2.5 jiao. In the cultural sector, Zhonghua did not open, and the market was flat. Commercial Press and World Book Company were down 4-5 yuan. Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company rebounded slightly by 2 yuan. Great China Match maintained a steady trend. In the public utilities sector, Zhabei Water & Electricity rebounded slightly by 1 yuan. China General Edison and the prices on the previous Saturday were similar. Other stocks saw sparse trading and stagnant prices. Overall market sentiment was fairly calm. The stock price table for each stock market is listed below:

Yesterday, the quoted price for gold jewelry sold by the Daxin and other silver shops in this city was 2,150 yuan per tael, unchanged (purchase price reduced by about 300 yuan). The price for gold exchanged among the shops initially remained firm, but then turned weak. In the morning, it was 1,890 yuan, up 5 yuan, and once rose to 1,900 yuan. However, it then retreated back to 1,880 yuan, down 5 yuan compared to the previous Saturday, with a difference of 20 yuan. Trading was very thin. The quoted price for silver jewelry was 16 yuan per tael, also unchanged. The price for inter-shop trading further decreased to 10.078 yuan, with few buyers.

### Cotton Cloth Sees Slight Gains, Colorful Ball Fine Cloth Has Tightest Supply

Yesterday, the factory cloth market defied expectations and rose instead of falling, with the situation turning firm. The sentiment in various quarters was to take advantage of small dips, which led to a particularly stable base. Coarse and fine cloth rose by 1.5 to 2 yuan per piece. 16-pound "Earth" coarse cloth was 177 yuan, "Flying Goose" was 175 yuan, 9-pound "New Character" was 109 yuan, 8-pound "Zhenzhong" was 107 yuan, 12-pound "Earth" fine cloth was 162 yuan, "Fugui" was 151 yuan, "Dapeng" was 150 yuan, and "Peach Blossom Lady Lin" was 256 yuan. Starting with a slight increase to 254 yuan, the eastern cloth rose, and the number of buyers increased sharply. By the afternoon closing, it was 258.25 yuan, and it continued to rise by 0.5 yuan in the after-market, to 258.75 yuan, an increase of 2.75 yuan. Poplin and serge also increased in price accordingly. "Three Sheep" serge spot goods were 5.85 yuan, with buyers, up 0.1 yuan. "Longevity" poplin was 5.85 yuan, "Volleyball Yarn" poplin was 3.95 yuan, and "Qin Meiren" plain cloth was 163 yuan, also up 2 yuan.

Eastern cloth initially fell and then rose. Fine cloth rose sharply by about 2.5 to 4 yuan. The factory price for 12-pound "Dragon Head" fine cloth opened at only 166 yuan, but gradually rose to 172 yuan. "Colorful Ball" fine cloth rose to 164.5 yuan, and after the closing, it was 164.75 yuan, with buyers wanting it. Supply was the tightest. "Flying Fish" and "Yang He" also required 160 to 161 yuan. "Trumpet" was 158 yuan. "Four Gentlemen" serge opened at a low of 7.1 yuan in the morning. There were more buyers than sellers in the market, rising to 0.24 yuan, then falling back to 0.19 yuan, and then rising again. By the afternoon closing, it had risen to 7.28 to 7.29 yuan. Market sentiment was very strong.

### Woolens Suddenly See Excitement

The overcoat market suddenly became lively yesterday. Because the association's price limit has been released, buyers are requesting samples and inquiries, and real money has increased. People are excited. The large wholesalers on Qipan Street, who have not had any purchases for a long time, have recently been competing to buy. At the same time, business at various stores is gradually improving, and the market atmosphere has suddenly improved. Men's and women's colored overcoats are more popular than other woolens. Given the weak inventory, imported goods are even stronger. Yesterday, the limited sales price for No. 1 cashmere overcoat was 1,000 yuan, and most sellers were unwilling to sell. The limited sales price for Meifeng overcoat was 450 yuan, while the market price for entire box purchases was 370 yuan.

### Oil Merchants Buy In, Japanese Military Notes Stabilize

Yesterday, in the foreign exchange market, Japanese military notes stabilized. Small oil merchants bought in, but many were selling off hundreds and thousands of yuan, resulting in an inter-bank trading price of 5.55557 yuan, the same as the previous Saturday. Silver shops and small money shops sold at 5.5565 yuan, slightly higher, and some required 5.557 yuan, while purchasing at around 5.555 yuan.

Yesterday, the interest rate for inter-bank lending was 0.12 yuan, unchanged. New loans and cash were exchanged at the same price.

### Limited Deliveries, Bean Prices Increased by Owners

The source of beans is not smooth, and the supply is limited, which has led to an upward sentiment and increased prices. Yesterday, more than 30 packages of Hongqiao Qing beans opened at a price of 162 yuan. 20 packages of Tianjin tea beans were priced at 230 yuan, and 20 packages of Chacha red beans were priced at 166 yuan.

Bran is in short supply and is selling well. Yesterday, due to considerable demand from rural areas, and the owners intending to hoard goods, the price jumped. 500 small bags of Sanxin bran with a warehouse receipt dated June 15th were priced at 110 yuan.

### Cantonese Branches Arrive in Large Quantities, Outlook Loosens

The second batch of glutinous rice branches and yuan branches/flat branches produced in Guangdong Province has arrived, with a total of 13,000 boxes. Calculated by dan, there are only 5,000 to 6,000. Given that sales were not widespread before, the quantity seems excessive. Therefore, the current quotation will inevitably loosen.

### What is Expected of School Authorities

— Reporter

Books must be read, and tuition fees must be paid. Everyone is complaining about the high tuition fees, but for the sake of their children's future, they still have to pay the fees with great difficulty.

School expenses have increased, and teachers' lives are even more difficult. There is a justifiable reason for increasing tuition fees, but we are very concerned about whether teachers' salaries can increase proportionally, given that the tuition burden on students' parents has increased several times.

If the school authorities can consider the needs of poor students or the difficulties of poor teachers when collecting tuition fees, high tuition fees would be justified, and low tuition fees would also be justified. Only schools that profit are unacceptable.

Frankly speaking, we feel that the general tuition fees this semester are too expensive. It is not enough that tuition fees are expensive; we need to understand the teachers' compensation in schools with high tuition fees. In other words, we do not want tuition fees to be very expensive while teachers are still suffering.

What we expect is that, in addition to a relatively uniform standard for fees in general schools, we would like schools that charge higher or even very high fees to publicly announce their income and expenses within the school. In that case, even if teachers' compensation is poor, it would be reasonable. Otherwise, even if the school authorities are just covering expenses, it would still be difficult to silence the criticism. Wise school authorities may not consider my words to be too blunt.

### Teachers' Complaints

— Xin Meng

The calendar pages are torn off quickly. After Teachers' Day, the two summer vacations have passed in the blink of an eye. Every school is also moving with the seasons, preparing for the start of the semester.

Everyone in China knows that being a teacher is the least promising career. Although the responsibility is quite heavy, the meager pay exceeds that of any other profession. Especially in the past half year, due to low salaries, high prices, and currency fluctuations, the suffering of ordinary teachers has been even greater than in previous years.

When the summer vacation began, I visited several colleagues and learned that everyone had run a deficit during the half-year of teaching. At the same time, they were worried about how to survive the two months of summer vacation. Not to mention those with families, even single people felt that the money they earned was not enough!

After much thought, at the beginning of this autumn semester, ordinary teachers, recalling their past hardships and thinking about better-paying professions, found it difficult to find a new job for the time being. They had no choice but to return to the old path, pick up the teaching whip again, live that cold, unpromising life, looking both helpless and pathetic.

School principals should know very well the suffering of teachers. However, most principals only care about themselves and not about others, and they are very harsh on teachers' compensation. If the school is not making money, it is understandable; but some schools are clearly making money, yet the principal is indifferent to the suffering of teachers.

This semester, in Shanghai, the tuition fees in various schools have increased significantly. One of the main reasons for increasing tuition fees is to increase teachers' salaries and improve teachers' compensation. However, as this school year begins and teachers’ salaries are about to be decided, it remains to be seen whether they will be increased to meet the needs of teachers' lives.

Based on past experience, teachers' salaries this semester need to be at least three to five times higher than last semester to make ends meet. If the principal still only cares about himself and not about others, only slightly increases salaries, and teachers' lives are not truly improved, then it would truly be a betrayal of the parents who are burdened and solemnly paying the tuition fees.

### My Reading Method

— Yu An

When my grades in school are slightly better, people will ask, "What is your secret to studying?" Most people answer, "There's no secret to it. I listen when the teacher teaches, and then I constantly review the lessons every day. I don't cram before the exam, and then I don't have to worry about my grades." But experience tells us that there are a dozen or twenty subjects in school now. Even if you don't read so-called "leisure books" every day and go over these subjects, even students with a slightly better natural ability feel that they are running out of time, let alone ordinary students! Moreover, if you spend all your time buried in books, you don't care about anything in the world—because you really don't have time to take care of these things—you will inevitably become a bookworm, which is of no use!

I just finished high school, so let me write down my study methods, not to call them secrets, to provide you with some reference during this time of school opening!

There are two ways to read: the first is "raising an army for a thousand days to use it for a day," which is a method with long-term planning; the second is "digging a well when you are thirsty." In the eyes of some people, needless to say, the second method should be stopped. But I think both are valuable: the first is for being precise, the second is for being fast. If you only use the first method, you won't have enough time for a dozen or twenty subjects; if you only use the second method, you will get nothing and sometimes it is even harmful to your health. If you want to talk about secrets, it may just be whether these two methods are used properly or not.

Among a dozen or twenty subjects, you always have a few that you are interested in, or at least you can always find a few. Then you can divide these many subjects into two categories: Category A is what you like, and Category B is what you are not interested in. Then you read Category A using the first method and Category B using the second method. When reading Category A, you can find a few more reference books in addition to the textbook, so that you can get a deeper impression. After listening to the teacher explain the textbook, read the textbook carefully when you get home that day, and then when you have some space, read the section related to this in the reference book. It would be even better if you have some notes. If you like physics, chemistry, and biology, it is best to do it yourself. When reading Category B subjects, you should pay the most attention to listening in the classroom. When speaking, you should use a pencil to summarize the main ideas of each paragraph in the margins of the book or use a colored pen to make a mark. This can make it much easier when you are "digging a well when you are thirsty".

This reading method can be used for all subjects except foreign languages. For subjects that are similar to your personality, you can understand them more precisely and thoroughly as a result; you can also have a general idea of the subjects you don't like, so that you don't remain ignorant. Even better, you can take some time to see the world.

Teachers of education: The current education method that does not focus on the development of individuality is too hard on us students. If we study to death, we may not be applicable after graduation. If we don't study, we will feel ashamed if we don't pass. The study method I said above is not about being lazy. You only know how to compromise with the status quo and don't think about ways, that is lazy! Students, what do you think? (Donation to Student Aid Fund)

### Between Humans and Ghosts

— Si Nai

Mr. He eats lunch at the company during the day, so the sumptuous feast for the Hungry Ghost Festival, with both savory and festive dishes, was saved for dinner. Mr. He was indeed respectful and pious towards his ancestors. Every Ghost Festival, he offered savory dishes and burned paper money very piously, and even did it a few days early. This was not really a rule, but Mr. He believed that it was able to "carefully trace the origins and pursue the distant." Whether or not it was a rule was irrelevant.

Mr. He drank three cups of old wine, and almost half a duck was in his stomach. He ate too much, so he put a cigarette in his mouth and lay on the rattan chair, sipping rain-harvested tea at one dollar per tael.

"How much did today's dishes cost?" Mr. He suddenly asked his wife.

"More than sixty yuan, plus paper money and incense, it's about a hundred yuan."

"What?" Mr. He opened his eyes wide. "Isn't this month's budget already stretched?"

"Of course, this July, you only said that it would be enough to use a hundred yuan more. Now, the Qiaoguo cost ten yuan, I donated twenty yuan to the Taoist ritual, and the festival cost a hundred yuan, which is already one hundred and thirty. There's also going to the City God Temple on the fifteenth and offering incense to Dizang at the end of the month. I'm afraid that'll be another fifty or sixty yuan!" Mrs. He kept counting with her fingers.

"That's not right. Going on like this..." Mr. He's budget always seemed to be "shattering."

"That's not right, that's not right! What can you do?"

"I'm saying we're spending too much. I think we should save on things like the Dizang incense."

Mrs. He also had her own opinion. "How can we? Ancestors are important, and Bodhisattvas are even more important. They protect the peace of the family. Don't you remember when you had that serious illness? You made a wish in front of the Bodhisattva!"

"Alright, alright, wife, I'm saying even if you want to use it, save a little."

"How am I not saving? You bought the Qiaoguo; the children always want to pick one. For the Taoist ritual, people usually give fifty or sixty, but I only wrote twenty. The prices of incense and candles are also rising sharply now, but I only bought a pair of two taels, and I only bought a thousand pieces of paper money..."

Mr. He had nothing to say. This July was the world of ghosts, and the result was that people were suffering. In Mr. He's mind, ghosts and humans were a little related. Mrs. He also said that you can't completely believe it, and you can't not believe it. Mr. He took a sip of tea and said, "I think it's better to have more elaborate dishes. That's considered our sincerity towards our ancestors!"

(Eight) What to Do

The old woman nodded at first and said she had it, but after nodding, she shook her head and said no, no. Mrs. Ye Er said, "Why did you say you had it before, and then you said you didn't have it? You said that Miss Bian was in there, you told us, and we will definitely not tell your master that you said it." The old woman still shook her head and said, "No." Magpie shouted in Mrs. Ye Er's ear, "Mrs. Er, let's go inside." The old woman said, "That's right, that's right, go inside. Guests should go inside, I'll accompany you." She threw the bucket on the ground and led Mrs. Ye Er and her maid into the door, turning around and asking, "Are you here to see the master or the young master?" Mrs. Ye Er said, "Here to see the master, is he at home?" The old woman didn't say whether he was home or not. Inside the house, they went from one room to another, and finally to a room where the accounting books were stacked high on the desk, and there were three or four abacuses. The hateful Wei Yunqing was sitting sideways inside.

Wei Yunqing was also wearing glasses. Seeing that someone was visiting him, he pushed his glasses up, and the glasses were placed on his forehead. He looked at Mrs. Ye Er and immediately cracked a smile, and immediately stood up. With this smile and stand, the glasses still fell on the bridge of his nose. But he still took off his glasses and said, "Is this Mrs. Ye Er from the Ye family? Why did you come today, please sit down, please sit down. "Tea, Longjing, original brew." These last few words of his were to order the people below. The old woman was gone, and no one answered outside the door. Mrs. Ye Er said, "No need, no need. Mr. Wei, I wouldn't come without a reason. I'm here today to inquire about a person, Fei Changhe, is he at your residence?" Wei Yunqing said, "He has been here, but he is not here now." Mrs. Ye Er said, "What about Fei Changhe's wife and daughter, are they also at your residence?" Wei Yunqing said, "They have also been here, I don't know if they have left." Mrs. Ye Er said, "And Fei Changhe's niece, Cui Zhen, she, come to think of it, has she been here too?" (169)
