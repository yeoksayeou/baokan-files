### Frontline Silence for a Month and a Half, North Africa Sees Renewed Fierce Fighting: Cairo Announces Offensive Launched, German Army Also Warns of Preparations to Respond

Lisbon, 24th (Allied News Agency Telegram)

According to news from Cairo and Berlin today, the British Eighth Army on the Egyptian Alamein front launched an attack on Axis positions last night, breaking the month-and-a-half-long silence on that line. During this period, the weather was harsh, with sandstorms obscuring the sky and hindering military operations. Now, fierce fighting has resumed along the line. Both British and German sources report that fierce battles are developing, but clear information cannot be obtained from these reports, nor is it known whether the British attack was successful. Cairo sources said that the British offensive had strong air support, but Berlin did not indicate the trend of the battle, only stating that the Axis forces had launched a spring offensive in North Africa three months ago, traversing Libya and reaching Egyptian territory, within 100 miles of Alexandria, the British naval base, posing an unprecedented threat to Egypt.

Cairo, 24th (Havas News Agency Telegram)

The British Middle East Command has just announced that the British Eighth Army began launching an offensive on the Egyptian front last night, and a major battle is underway.

Stockholm, 24th (Reuter's News Agency Telegram)

A Cairo war report stated that the British Eighth Army, with the assistance of the Air Force, launched an offensive in Egypt last night and is currently engaged in fierce fighting. From the night of the 22nd to the 23rd, the Allied Air Force continued to put pressure on enemy airfields, shooting down eight German aircraft and destroying many Axis warplanes. A Taito aircraft was shot down by us.

Stockholm, 24th (Reuter's News Agency Telegram)

British military officials in Cairo stated that the offensive launched by the British Eighth Army last night was intended to defeat the Axis forces in North Africa and thereby determine the fate of the Mediterranean. In the days before the British launched this offensive, British aircraft bombed Rommel's lines of communication.

Stockholm, 24th (Reuter's News Agency Telegram)

News of the British Eighth Army launching an offensive on the Egyptian front quickly spread to London. Although the British people knew that the British and Americans would take action in Africa, they did not expect it to be so fast. People in London were skeptical about whether the British and Americans could launch a large-scale offensive, but this news brought some relief. The British have recently publicized their preparations for North Africa, so people have a strong impression that a major war will occur in North Africa, especially the large-scale air battles on the Egyptian front.

Berlin, 24th (Reuter's News Agency Telegram)

Reuter's military reporter Steelfried wrote that the British Eighth Army launched an attack on the German positions in Alamein last night and is currently engaged in fierce fighting. Details are unknown. According to the British, the British offensive was assisted by the Air Force. According to the German-Italian Allied forces' offensive this spring, they have penetrated deep into Egypt, about 100 kilometers from Alexandria, making it impossible for the British to defend their position in Egypt, greatly threatening their prestige in the Near East countries. At the same time, the German-Italian air bases are also close to the Nile region, and Axis aircraft can bomb the naval bases in Alexandria and the Suez Canal area. Therefore, the British have long wanted to obtain American assistance to launch a counter-offensive to consolidate their position. The German army was prepared to respond to the British offensive.

### A Great Fire Occurred Yesterday Afternoon in Yangjiadu, Pudong, Destroying Over 5,000 Shantytowns and Covering an Area of Three Li

At 10:30 AM yesterday, a fire suddenly broke out in the shantytown at No. 1675 Beicaonitang, south of Yangjiadu, Pudong, at the home of Gao Changnian, a native of Yangzhou, due to carelessness. The fire quickly intensified, and the wind fanned the flames, making it impossible to extinguish. The area was filled with shantytowns of poor migrant workers, densely packed like pigeon coops, so the fire spread rapidly and uncontrollably. Soon, firefighting boats from the Customs Water Police Station and the Pudong District Fire Brigade arrived one after another to extinguish the fire, which was finally put out at 1:00 PM. It is estimated that the fire burned about 5,000 households, covering an area of about three li. During the height of the fire, Yang Jin’s six-year-old daughter, Liu Juzi, was buried in the flames, and Liu Changshun’s three-month-old son was also burned to death. Many livestock also perished, and the cries of mourning were deafening, a truly unprecedented disaster.

The English-language North China Daily News reported that several hundred poor people lived in Yangjiadu Village (transliterated) in Pudong. Due to carelessness, a fierce fire broke out this morning (the 24th). From the Bund, across from the Roosevelt Wharf, a plume of thick smoke billowed up, not dissipating even in the afternoon. Upon receiving the news, the Water Fire Brigade dispatched the Puji (transliterated) fireboat to Pudong to assist in extinguishing the fire. Another fireboat also set off from its berth in Yangshupu to assist. As of noon, the Harbor Master's Office had not yet received a detailed report, so it was unknown whether any large warehouses, factories, or wharf buildings were affected or threatened by the fire. It is generally believed that since the fireboats could not reach far and the Pudong fire brigade was poorly equipped, the material damage would be extremely significant. It was reported that the fire started around 10:00 AM, and by 11:00 AM, black smoke began to rise into the sky, visible from the opposite bank of the Huangpu River.

### Cloth Prices Continue to Rise

Mill Cloth

Market sentiment continues to rise, mainly due to stable raw material prices and optimistic sentiment. Yesterday, white cloth prices also increased by 5 jiao to 1 yuan per bolt. 16-pound Earth coarse cloth was at 201 yuan. The same weight of Feihong was at 198 yuan. 9-pound New Character was at 113 yuan. 8-pound Zhenzhong was at 110 yuan. 12-pound Earth fine cloth was at 171 yuan. Dapeng New Single was at 167.5 yuan.

Eastern Cloth

Prices fluctuated upward. Although trading was sparse, the foundation was solid. The closing price of 12-pound Dragon Head Fine Cloth New Single in the afternoon was 178.5 yuan, up 1.5 yuan. Bank Single Dragon Head rose from 169.5 yuan to 71 yuan, closing in the afternoon at 170.5 yuan, also up 1 yuan. Caiqiu was at 169.5 yuan. Feiyu was at 167 yuan. Changhe was at 166.5 yuan. Trumpet was at 165.5 yuan. Wufu was at 165 yuan. Four Gentlemen Serge Red Single started at 7.13 yuan and closed in the afternoon at 7.15 yuan, up 7 fen.

### Continuous Acquisition of Large Tinplate

The 24-gauge and 26-gauge large tinplate circulating in the market have been continuously acquired by yarn factories and others for making rollers every day. The available stock is becoming increasingly scarce. At the same time, those in the industry who hold the remaining stock are extremely shrewd. Although only a dozen or so sheets have been traded, prices have reached a new high. Currently, 24-gauge is selling for 150 yuan per sheet, and 26-gauge is selling for 130 yuan per sheet, both up 10 yuan per sheet compared to the previous market. In addition, other hardware items, such as new angle iron, are at 16,000 yuan per ton. New Russian leather is at 14,000 yuan. New foreign square plates are at 12,000 yuan. Cement rebar and foreign square plate angle iron heads are all selling for 10,000 yuan per ton (prices for the above items are subject to slight increases). Prices are high, and sales are sluggish.

### Amidst the Crackdown on Pickpockets, the True Face of Pickpockets is Exposed: Well-Organized, Wide Range of Activities

Special Report from This Newspaper

The Shanghai Municipal Council Police Department is actively carrying out the crackdown on pickpockets, arresting an average of 20 to 30 people every day. Since the campaign began on October 6th, minor theft cases have decreased. At the same time, the French Concession Police Department has recently mobilized a large number of detectives to conduct searches for pickpocket gangs in various parts of the concession. A senior official of the Police Department stated that the most effective way to crack down on pickpockets is for citizens to closely assist the police.

### An Exploration of the Term "Pickpocket"

It is said that pickpocketing is one of the 360 trades, with apprenticeship and industry regulations, and a well-organized structure. However, it is not easy for outsiders to understand its inner workings. According to Xu Shen's Shuowen Jiezi, the character "pickpocket" is not found, and it is also not recorded in the Kangxi Dictionary. It is undoubtedly a product of modern times. The person who created the character was quite clever because this character is quite in line with the ideographic principles of the Six Writing Styles. When they commit their acts, the victim is unaware, and onlookers are indifferent. In that instant, property is transferred as if they had an extra skillful hand compared to ordinary people, hence the three hands.

### Small Coins Replaced by Razor Blades

The more crowded the place and the more tense the mood, the more ideal it is for them. In the past, their treasures were two Kangxi small coins ground to an extremely thin and sharp edge. In recent years, it is said that they have progressed to using razor blades. When they act, they usually have accomplices with them to avoid detection. For example, on a tram, once they find a target, one person will push you in front, and as you shake slightly, another person will quickly use a razor blade to cut through your underwear, and the wallet falls out, which is caught immediately. Their techniques are truly swift, so-called "not allowing even a hair's breadth." What is especially magical is that the lightness or heaviness of their cutting must be just right. Viennese underwear is different from old cloth short jackets. Indian silk and serge have different thicknesses. If they cut too hard, they will easily be noticed. If they cut too lightly, the incision will be too small, and the wallet will not fall out. Otherwise, if they cut a silk underwear with too much force, the blade will go straight into the victim's buttock skin, and the wallet may not be obtained, but the crime of assault has been committed. Wouldn't that be terrible?

### A Clever Trick: "Feigning Capture to Let Go"

In addition, how to identify the target is also a relatively difficult skill. Those wearing Chinese clothing have pockets on both sides, while those wearing Western suits always hide their wallets in their back pockets, which look full and bulging, or it could be a diary or cigarette case. Pickpockets often use a trick to deal with this difficult situation: they suddenly shout loudly, "It's crowded, be careful of your pockets!" Careful people cannot help but press the place where they keep their money after this reminder. This is tantamount to saying, "The silver is not buried here!" And the second act is that the Wang Er next door did not steal it.

### Lost Items Can Be Returned

Pickpockets have a gang organization and are probably not able to "debut" without rigorous training. They operate in designated areas with order. According to the reporter, if the victim is familiar with the ins and outs, they can entrust someone in the pickpocket world, spend a little tip, and recover the lost property. Their slang term for this is "transfer Zhao," but it is limited to three days. This is a fact. A friend named Zhang once used this method to recover a bundle of important documents.

### A Foreign Story

A certain writer who traveled to Europe and the United States told the reporter that the famous American pickpocket Eddile Jackson reigned supreme in the Midwestern states. His colleagues respected him as a master of his generation. His pickpocketing skills were so exquisite that the police could do nothing about him. A certain honest gentleman, because he was often favored by Jackson, hated him to the extreme. Once, he specially filled a money bag with waste paper and wrote two sentences on it: "This time, you've fallen for my trick, you beast!" He waited for several days, but it was not pickpocketed. This made the honest gentleman feel extremely surprised, thinking that this villain's awareness was truly unmatched. However, the surprise did not end there. When he opened the money bag to inspect it, he found that the sentences had been changed to: "Don't joke around, you beast!"

### Demonstrate Magical Techniques

Cracking down on pickpockets is a virtuous act. The reporter believes that in addition to diligently catching pickpockets like bedbugs, it is also important to instill preventive knowledge in citizens. In the past, a kind of film was often seen, the purpose of which was to analyze sports movements. When the film was shown, it would start with a fast-paced action shot, and then the film would be slowed down so that the action process of each movement would be clearly shown. For today's plan, the police authorities might as well have the many pickpockets they have caught demonstrate their various pickpocketing techniques, filming them and showing them on a tour so that citizens can understand the process of their "third hand" activity and know what to guard against, which will be very effective (Qin Meng).

### Chinese vs. Western Round Gateball Tournament: Nanyang vs. Western Youth Today

The Chinese vs. Western Round Gateball对抗大賽, with the Chinese champion Nanyang team, is scheduled to play its first match against the Western Youth team at 3:00 PM today at the Guangxia Middle School field at the intersection of Moore Road and Fuxu Road. The referees are Wu Zibin and Zhang Juefei. The Nanyang team has many multi-talented basketball and double-squash players, such as goalkeeper Zhang Banglun and forward Han Longhai, who are particularly well-known. In addition, Xu Xilu and Li Zhuang's defense is impenetrable, and Fan Qingcheng and Han Longquan are all top-notch players. Today, they have also invited famous basketball players Qu Xilin and Qu Xilong to assist, which is most exciting. The blue-and-white main player Bao Songyuan will also play for Nanyang, making a guest appearance as center, which makes them even stronger. The Western Youth team has been engaged in this sport since the spring of this year. In the early summer, they played against the round gateball originator Blue and White, and the result was a narrow defeat by only one goal, 3 to 4. However, their crisp and sharp style has already left a deep impression on the audience. Their lineup includes strong players such as Du Laiye, Long Gong, Sasha Jin, Feng Kaikeman, Miluofu, Founike, Smith's Wei and her husband, and Taoblinji's center defense. With Sasha Jin guarding the goal, the lineup is complete and very ideal. This time, they are making a comeback and will surely pose a serious threat to Nanyang. The competition will be decided by a best-of-three series for the championship. The date of the second match will be announced soon. In addition, the English translation of round gateball has been determined to be Areh Ball, which means "semi-circular arc shape," which is very accurate.

### Yousheng vs. Jewish Team A at 4:00 PM Today

A wonderful friendly soccer match between the Yousheng team and Jewish Team A is scheduled to take place at the Jewish Club field at No. 680 Zhaofeng Road at 4:00 PM today. Yousheng is a strong team in the Western League B group, with many fierce generals under its command. Last week, they defeated Jewish Team B, showing their strength. The Jewish Team A has an exceptionally complete and valiant lineup this year. Even Northwest Children will be captured by them, which demonstrates their strength.

### Saving Household Expenses to Subsidize Meal Expenses for Impoverished Students

— Hua

Everything is very expensive now, and meal expenses for young students are even more problematic. Some students have simple living arrangements because their families are not in Shanghai, and some have already burdened themselves with tuition fees and have no extra resources to cover meal expenses.

Students are mostly in the developmental stage, and they require more nutrition than people of other ages. Moreover, studying requires focused thinking. However, if even eating is a problem, how can we talk about so much else?

However, the number of students is still a small part of the total population of Shanghai. In other words, Shanghai does not lack people who can afford to subsidize them. If we can possibly control household expenses, we can use the money saved to subsidize these impoverished students.

Doing good is the greatest joy. When we think of our own happiness, we can express sympathy for the impoverished and rise up to help them.

(Note: The YMCA is now establishing a fundraising committee to subsidize meal expenses for impoverished students to comprehensively plan and carry out relief efforts. Readers who wish to make donations can send them directly to the YMCA at Baxianqiao.)

### Heart-to-Heart Talk

— Si

Someone once asked a novelist what he thought was the happiest time. His answer was "four feet on the fireplace rack." He meant that the husband and wife were quietly talking heart-to-heart together. This is what our countrymen call "conversing intimately."

Indeed, if we have nothing to hope for, we can get rid of work worries, and the children are playing on their own. The house is quiet and silent. The husband and wife can talk about everyday family matters, reminisce about the past, review the present, and plan for the future. It can truly be said to be the joy of life.

The reason is very simple because family life can be divided into material and spiritual aspects. Many families have reached the extreme in material enjoyment, but their spirits are in pain. It is better to have less material enjoyment and get spiritual comfort.

And holding this spirit is in line with the art of living: "A humble room is fine; why must it be large? Fragrance is not in abundance; it is in quality."

### Children's Emotions

— Dr. Gui Zhiliang

Human emotions have a considerable development in infancy, so a violent sound or suddenly moving the hands of the person holding the baby will cause the baby to show signs of fear. When the baby's little hands and feet are restrained, it will also get angry and cry loudly. Conversely, when a baby cries, gently stroking its body will make it feel comfortable and stop its crying.

Simply put, emotions are beneficial to people. For example, fear is a means of self-defense in the process of human survival. Knowing the dangers of flames can avoid the pain of being scorched. Fearing the shame of failing a grade can make many children work hard. Appropriate competitiveness can encourage the success of many careers. In summary, moderate emotional impulses are beneficial, but violent emotional impulses or unreasonable impulses are unhealthy.

What emotions are reasonable? Losing a close relative inevitably causes grief, but this sorrow is completely different from someone with a mental illness pitying themselves all day and night. It is excusable for children to be happy because the New Year is approaching or because a certain classmate has an upcoming date, and they refuse to go to sleep as usual. It is also a natural reaction to feel troubled by poor grades in school. These are all reasonable reactions.

Emotional impulses can also affect physiological functions. Physical fatigue, disappointment, and depression often cause headaches and dizziness. During exams or other times of emotional stress, urination is frequent. When frightened, the skin turns pale, the heart races, the pulse is weak, and the appetite is poor. If these symptoms are short-lived, then the emotions will disappear as the environment changes, which is the usual reaction. If the reaction is too violent or lasts too long, it is a sign of unhealthiness.

Among the more common emotions, jealousy is the first to consider. The firstborn child is the center of the family, and the entire attention of parents, relatives, and friends is focused on them. Suddenly, a younger sibling arrives to invade their world, and jealousy often arises. Smart parents will make good use of the child's sense of responsibility to help them prepare for the arrival of the new sibling.

Children's tantrums are common. Except for children with intellectual disabilities, this behavior is due to improper family or school education. These crying and wailing children are testing their elders. If they give in, they can temporarily stop crying, but they have grasped the winning weapon in their hands, and they will cry, jump, and roll around whenever they encounter unpleasant things in the future because they already know that prolonged victory belongs to them. For this kind of child, we must first check whether there is any physiological stimulation that makes their emotions unstable. Do not easily believe in treatments that promote rest and blood enrichment, because these treatments make the child self-pity, demand more special attention, and the parents must control their own emotions, because children are the smartest observers. If they see their father full of anger at home and their mother gossiping about the neighbors all day long, they will also imitate them. Therefore, parents must lead by example, otherwise, they will lose the right to manage their children.

For the child themselves, we should adopt a "do not ask, do not listen" attitude. When emotions are high, no one will be willing to listen to advice. It is best to ignore them. When a child throws a tantrum, they expect adults to give in or wait for punishment. In any case, they get some attention. If they see that they are ignored and they do not get any attention, they will be very disappointed and will not repeat this behavior in the future.

Parents or teachers should deeply understand that the future of emotionally unstable children is not optimistic. Because parents can never protect them by giving in to them for life, once the parents die, who will have the same love, patience, and obedience to all their demands? Their future loneliness, pain, and annoyance are unimaginable. Therefore, parents who truly love their children must first train them to control their emotions.

Family Mailbox

Mr. Editor:

I am a young man of marriageable age and I also hope to have a family to call home. However, due to my economic circumstances, I cannot fulfill my wish. Furthermore, I did not find a suitable match before leaving vocational school, so I inevitably feel pessimistic about my outlook on life. I have long admired your publication and the writers for being a beacon of light for those in difficulty. I dare to ask you to answer the following small questions on my behalf:

(1) How can one cultivate optimism in life and suppress the occurrence of pessimism? (2) What is the latest age a man can postpone marriage? (3) Can a satisfying result come from getting to know someone through introduction? (4) What are the necessary conditions for marriage and how to manage a typical household?

Respectfully, Feng

XXXXXX

Mr. Feng:

The issue of marriage is indeed one of life's important problems. Many young people become anxious because they cannot resolve this issue when they reach a certain age. Now, we will answer your questions below. (1) It is not difficult to cultivate optimism in life. You can find legitimate pastimes or establish a plan for advancement and follow that plan. There was once a patient who felt that life was beautiful after listening to the music of Doskonnay. These opportunities are numerous, it all depends on whether you seek them out. (2) As long as the reason is acceptable, there is no limit to the age a man can marry. (3) Yes, it is possible. In fact, getting to know each other between men and women must go through procedures, and you can also hear about the other person's general situation from the introducer. (4) Marriage is an art that requires a lifetime of effort to study exhaustively. As for the necessary conditions, there are physical health, similarity of interests, beauty of the environment, common cooperation, etc. Due to space constraints, it cannot be fully described. This publication has always strived to contribute some useful materials for families to refer to. You can purchase various books describing family issues and read this publication regularly. If you have any other questions, feel free to write to us. This publication sincerely welcomes you.

### Song of Four Essentials

— The late Mr. Shen Zhuren

This publication previously published Mr. Shen Zhuren of Qiantang's "Words on Relishing Poverty," whose meaning was refined, incisive, and extremely cherished by readers. Now, Mr. Zong Hao has sent a copy of Mr. Shen's "Song of Four Essentials" to "Frosty Sky" for publication, which criticizes worldly customs and is truly beneficial to society and people's hearts. Therefore, we are publishing it urgently to share with readers.

Rise early, rise early, the sky is high, the earth is vast, the air is fresh. Fragrant flowers and singing birds, good morning light, cultivate habits, become natural, increase life and preserve the body forever.

Walk, walk, walk at a leisurely pace, safe roads without dangers. Call friends and companions, tread the fragrant suburbs, realize heavenly opportunities, temper disposition. Activate collaterals, relax tendons, dispel vulgar worries.

The heart should be good, the heart should be good, cultivate oneself, regulate family, govern state, and bring peace to the world. Benevolence, righteousness, and morality are the real treasures. Strive tirelessly, infinite expectations, why necessarily pray before the gods?

Ambition should be high, ambition should be high, humans are the triad alongside heaven and earth. Qi soars above the clouds for ten thousand ages. Unlike grass and trees, each is matched with rotten talent. Possessing virtue and talent is calculated as a hero. (Contribution of Aid to Education Fund)

### Twenty Letters from the Ge Family

— Sincerely, Xu Baiyi

Mr. Ge Laiheng's son has been promoted from the position of managing mail to being a bookkeeper. This made him very happy, so he specifically wrote a letter to express his joy and give him some encouragement.

Mr. Ge Laiheng does not treat his own child as a spoiled brat and puts business first in everything. This can also be said to be worthy of admiration.

Eighth Letter

Promotion and salary increase. The doctor here is treating me for rheumatism. He says that it can be cured in about thirty days, so I think I can return to Chicago in about two weeks. My doctor is just like some doctors. He can cure poor people two weeks earlier, and he needs two weeks for rich people. He claims to be a specialist, but I think that is the reason why he charges ten dollars for every time he looks at my tongue.

But this is not the intended beginning of my letter. What I want to tell you is that I was unspeakably happy to read your letter saying that you have been promoted from the position of mail manager to bookkeeper. I feel very gratified that your superiors can actually appreciate you.

I used to hire a Kryto, who had lost his mother. His father had worked for me as a bookkeeper before he died. In the first three weeks of the month, he always put away the ledgers half an hour before the end of office hours, and at the end of the fourth week, he worked overtime every day to find the eight cents that was missing. After he passed away, his wife found that his life insurance had expired for a month, so she brought her children to the company to ask me for a job.

In my opinion, Krelan was not a lovely child, but just a miniature of his father. However, his mother thought he was a very remarkable talent. I felt it was difficult to refuse her plea, so I assigned him to be an errand boy. His mother couldn't help but shed tears as she watched him leave her arms, and repeatedly asked me to take care of him. There were many jokes that morning. He was looking for things in the ashtray, it turned out that he was smoking, but since it was his first day at the company, no one paid attention to him. However, not long after, a customer came from Barton, leading a child wearing velvet pants. While the customer and I were discussing the terms of the contract, the child inadvertently walked to the place where the errand boys ate, and Krelan actually started to play with the child. As a result, the customer cancelled the contract and criticized my company as a place with a bad environment. I had no choice but to immediately fire Krelan, although his mother said many complaints, blaming me for burying her husband's whole life and refusing to promote her children.

The reason I cite this example is simply to let you know that my policy is that I am very slow to decide on my judgment, so I want you to work under Mr. Millingen so that I can understand you through his eyes. If he thinks you can be promoted to bookkeeper and receive a salary of twelve yuan, I don't think there will be any mistakes.

Of course, I am very happy to see talents gradually progressing, whether he is my child or not, so I hope that this promotion for you is the starting point for your rise, and I wish you a bright future.

Your loving father, Ge Laiheng
