### Kharkov Front: Battle Reaches its Peak; Both Germany and the Soviet Union Claim Victory

Stockholm, Sweden, 21st (Havas) – Regarding the battles in the Kharkov region, a dispatch from Havas World News Agency reporters states that the fighting in the area is intensifying and has reached its peak. Stretching from Belgorod in the north to Lozovaya in the south, the line is only 150 miles long, but the combined forces of both sides number hundreds of thousands, with hundreds of tanks also in use. As of now, it is difficult to determine which side holds a strategic advantage. What is known is that the large-scale offensive of the Red Army south of Kharkov is still progressing. This offensive was launched from the Belgorod-Volchansk line and is being coordinated with the Red Army concentrated in Chuguev. According to Moscow, the northern forces have made no progress, while the Red Army advancing from Chuguev has made good progress towards Merefa (15 miles south of Kharkov, also a railway hub). Other units have advanced southwest from Chuguev and reached the Kharkov-Lozovaya railway. South of Kharkov, the German forces under General von Bock have launched an offensive, attempting to pressure the Red Army's left flank and cut off its lines of communication. This offensive may determine the fate of the battle of Kharkov and will have a significant impact on the future development of the Eastern Front. Both belligerents are very optimistic, claiming victory and stating that their positions have not been breached.

Soviet Left Wing Reinforced to Counter German Offensive

Soviet border, 21st (Havas) – Today is the 334th day of the German-Soviet war, with the most notable event being the major battle of Kharkov. On this front, Soviet forces are exerting pressure in the north, while German forces are counter-attacking from the south. Fierce fighting continues. However, the speed of the Soviet advance has noticeably slowed. According to the Red Army newspaper "Red Star," Soviet forces occupied several villages and towns yesterday. The German counter-offensive line stretches from Izyum in the north to Kupyansk, extending along the Donets River east to the Slavyansk region. Therefore, General Moskalenko had to withdraw troops from the Chuguev front to reinforce the left wing. Consequently, the Soviet offensive towards Merefa is no longer as important. Currently, military observers still believe that the struggle for Kharkov is merely a series of isolated battles preceding the winter campaign and the overall German offensive. Germany will soon launch major military operations on all fronts. The Soviet army is now preparing to face the overall German offensive. Furthermore, it is generally believed in Britain and the United States that the Soviet Union should immediately attack Taganrog to prevent German advances towards Rostov and the Caucasus.

22nd (Reuters) – According to Soviet front-line reports, the Battle of Kharkov has entered a new phase, with fighting taking place in the open fields or undefended towns and villages. German forces are launching attacks from the Izyum area, counter-attacking the flanks of the Soviet forces that have penetrated the German defenses around Kharkov. The Soviet side officially announced, "Yesterday, Soviet forces continued their offensive operations in the Kharkov area and continued to advance. The number of Soviet attacks in the Izyum area." The battle for the Kerch Peninsula continues in the east. "Red Star" reported from the front lines that in the Battle of Kharkov, German troops in several areas have been encircled but are still holding out in strongly fortified positions. Soviet units are surrounding these German garrisons and destroying them before they can break out or be reinforced. The Germans are now deploying all of their reserves from their spring offensive to try to stem the Soviet advance. A major tank battle occurred in one sector of the front, the outcome of which is still unclear. After the Soviet forces broke through the main German defense line, the fighting has become localized. The German army, having suffered heavy tank losses, is now changing its tactics, counter-attacking with infantry units and using small groups of only ten to fifteen tanks and aircraft for support. When attacking artillery positions, the German army uses "tank pincer tactics," with the central tanks prepared to sacrifice themselves so that other tank units can flank and destroy the artillery teams. However, this tactic was foiled by Soviet artillery fire from the front and sides. Soviet infantry, equipped with anti-tank weapons, also repelled the German tank attacks.

Bitter Fighting in the Far North; Advances and Retreats on Both Sides

Berlin, 22nd (Haitong News Agency) – Over the past few weeks, Soviet forces have used 37 battalions to attack the German defense lines on the Murmansk and Lapland fronts, but they have all been repelled by German mountain troops. The first attack began on April 26. Subsequently, between April 28 and May 13, Soviet forces launched a total of 129 attacks. The climate there is still extremely harsh. Soviet forces launched 67 fierce attacks on the German lines on the southern flank, all of which were unsuccessful. While the fighting was in progress, the Soviets used six battalions of marines to launch an amphibious assault on the German northern flank. The German forces, whose coastal strength was weaker, retreated, preventing the Soviet plan of encirclement from being realized. Before long, the Germans launched a concentrated counter-attack and annihilated most of the Soviet troops. From May 14 to 15, the Germans continued their counter-attacks many times and recovered the previously abandoned areas. More than 8,000 Soviet troops were killed, and a large number of prisoners and war equipment fell into German hands. It is estimated that from the end of April to mid-May, the Soviet losses in the battles of Murmansk and Lapland have reached more than 20,000.

London, 22nd (Reuters) – According to reports from Moscow, Soviet troops in the northern Karelia region, wading through knee-deep cold water and crossing forests, advanced 12 miles and penetrated deep into the right flank of the German-Finnish lines, reaching within a few miles of the Axis forces' vital lines of communication. These lines of communication are now under Soviet artillery fire. The Axis forces have deployed all their reserves, including a Finnish regiment, advancing from Ukhta on the north bank of the Koito River. However, within a few hours, they were surrounded by Soviet forces and completely routed.

Defense of Kerch: Heavy Soviet Casualties

Stockholm, Sweden, 21st (Havas) – According to Moscow, German attacks near Kerch have been repelled. The Red Army launched repeated attacks in the Kerch area, but were met with staunch German resistance. However, the Red Army is fiercely defending Kerch Peninsula and still fighting hard. According to reliable sources, the Soviet military authorities have ordered the Red Army in the area to resist to the end in order to contain the German forces and prevent them from launching an offensive on the east bank of the Kerch Isthmus.

Berlin, 21st (Havas) – German military officials recently commented that, on the Kerch Peninsula, because the enemy is scattered and hidden in the terrain, appearing unpredictably and suddenly attacking the German rear when the Germans are unprepared, this phenomenon will not recur after the enemy is completely cleared out. According to reports, the battle for Kerch is extraordinarily fierce, with corpses littering the fields in the areas of Voykovo and Yenikale. The Red Army is holding artillery positions and vowing not to retreat, suffering heavy casualties. In one sector alone, the Red Army suffered 18,000 killed or wounded and 4,000 captured. The Red Army is using cellars as bases for counter-attacks. The fighting at the Yenikale fortress is also extremely fierce. The Red Army is defending this position heroically as its last stronghold. In this battle, the Red Army suffered 3,000 killed or wounded and 5,400 captured. Berlin, 22nd (Haitong News Agency) – German officials pointed out that the number of Soviet soldiers captured by German forces on the Kerch Peninsula has reached 169,198, with 284 tanks and 1,397 artillery pieces seized.

Lisbon, 22nd (Haitong News Agency) – Renowned British military commentator Liddell Hart wrote in the "Daily Mail," commenting on the German occupation of the Kerch Peninsula, stating that the amazing thing about the Battle of Kerch is that the Germans used as many as 2,000 dive bombers, which exceeds the British estimate of the total number of dive bombers used by Germany on the entire Eastern Front. It can be seen that Germany has intensified its production of dive bombers during the winter in order to engage in larger-scale group offensives. Generally speaking, the German conquest of Kerch, although a preparation for advancement, is not enough to indicate that it has inflicted a major blow on the Soviet offensive and can only be regarded as a probing action. The consequences will depend on the future movements of the German army.

### Mexico May Declare War on Axis Powers; Protesting Note Rejected by Germany; Two More Mexican Ships Sunk

Mexico City, 22nd (Havas) – A government spokesman said last night that after the Mexican oil tanker "Potrero del Llano" was sunk by an Axis submarine, the Cabinet will hold a temporary emergency meeting today to decide whether to declare war on the Axis powers.

Mexico City, 22nd (Reuters) – Officials here announced today that Germany has refused to accept Mexico's note regarding the sinking of a Mexican oil tanker last week. According to a Mexican government spokesman, the war issue will be decided by the parliamentary committee meeting today. Because the German reply to Mexico's protest was unsatisfactory, many members of the Mexican cabinet advocated an immediate declaration of war. Former Mexican President Cardenas has been summoned to Mexico City, and the Minister of War and Chief of the Senate said that the Mexican army is prepared to take necessary actions. However, there are also cabinet members who favor only declaring a state of emergency and confiscating all or part of the Axis countries' property in Mexico. Rumor has it that two more Mexican ships have been sunk, one between Cuba and the United States, and one off the coast of Brazil. The Mexican Ministry of Foreign Affairs has not commented on this.

New York, 12th (Reuters) – According to news from Mexico City, the Mexican oil tanker "Faja de Oro" has been torpedoed off the coast of Brazil.

Mexico City, 22nd (Havas) – The 22 rescued crew members of the Mexican oil tanker "Potrero del Llano," which was sunk by an Axis submarine, arrived here yesterday. As many as 10,000 people welcomed them at the pier, and 2,000 children scattered flowers along the way.

### Chongqing Construction; India-China Highway; High Mountains and Ridges; Numerous Obstacles

Hankou, 21st (Allied Press) – According to reports from Chongqing, after the Japanese army invaded Yunnan Province, all routes to Chongqing were blocked. In order to open a lifeline, Chongqing began to construct the Chongqing-India highway. Starting in May, 400,000 laborers were mobilized to first build the highway between Ba'an and Zayu. However, due to the mountainous terrain and numerous natural obstacles, its construction is extremely difficult, and whether it can be completed is still in doubt. Recently, the Wuhan Daily published an article on whether the road can be completed, stating that the road must traverse the rugged mountains of Xikang and Tibet, causing the project to be delayed. During the winter snow season, people and horses cannot pass at all. In addition, there are large rivers and streams running north and south between Ba'an and Zayu, which is the biggest difficulty in the entire project, as bridge construction is difficult to achieve quickly.

### Japanese Army Attacks Eastern Zhejiang

A certain front line, 22nd (Allied Press) – The Central China Japanese Army reporting team announced at 4:00 PM today that strong Japanese forces launched a general offensive against the newly organized 9th Army and the 88th Army in eastern Zhejiang on the morning of May 15, defeating them in a pincer movement on the banks of the Dongyang River.

### Nehru Delivers Speech; Resolves to Fight with All His Might; Opposes the Partition of India

US Technical Delegation Returns Home – Lahore, 22nd (Reuters) – Yesterday, Nehru delivered a speech opposing the partition of India, saying that he supports organizing a federation of India, China, Iran, and Afghanistan. He is willing to fight with all his might against the issue of partition, but he must state that he cannot force others to adopt the same attitude as him. He believes that if a majority of the people in a particular area advocate partition, no one can prohibit it. However, his views differ from those of former Madras Prime Minister Rajagopalachari. Nehru himself is willing to do his utmost to prevent the partition of India, while Rajagopalachari's movement advocates the establishment of a people's government in Madras, which is tantamount to advocating acceptance of the British Indian government. This is something that Nehru cannot agree to. Nehru also said that the matter of participating in the war has long been on his mind. He expresses absolute sympathy for the Soviet Union and China, and has guaranteed sympathy for China and aid to China, but it is beyond his capabilities. However, he cannot therefore sit idly by.

Such rumors are not only dangerous but also violate the revolutionary spirit. Therefore, anyone found spreading such rumors in the future must be sentenced to the most severe punishment."

### The World's Only Peaceful City: Ramblings in Lisbon (4) Exchange for International Diplomats

For such a small country, if Spain's Franco were to become ruthless and create some incident as an excuse, he could swallow it alive. But in reality, that is not the case. This is due to the Portuguese's "small size, large substitute." Although the mainland is small, its territories are not, becoming a ratio of 34 to 800. Secondly, it is due to its close relationship with Britain throughout the generations: people even call it a province of Britain. This time, its capital, Lisbon, is able to serve as a contact point for warring countries, which is of course due to its suitable transportation position, but its friendship with Britain is also a major factor.

Having said something about Portugal and its capital, Lisbon, we must return to the issue of exchanging diplomatic personnel that we mentioned earlier.

As mentioned earlier, diplomatic personnel are representatives and envoys sent by the commissioning country to handle all matters related to promoting friendly relations. However, human hearts are no longer as ancient as they used to be, and they often engage in some deceptive practices. Therefore, for the sake of prudence, one must treat each other as petty people. Originally, in a conflict between two countries, envoys were not killed. Therefore, even if both sides were at war, diplomatic envoys could always be safe and sound.

There are several ways to deal with diplomatic personnel from enemy countries after a declaration of war: some are recalled by their own country in advance, and some are returned their passports by the host country's government, ordering them to leave the country within a certain period of time. Before leaving the country, there is also a considerable period of hesitation. During this period, if no conduct detrimental to the host country is carried out, then all security issues must be borne by the host country, and they must not be treated as enemies, and they must be allowed to enjoy extraterritoriality and inviolability. When the last World War began in 1914, all the warring countries were well-mannered and acted in accordance with the terms of international law.

Diplomatic personnel can request to stay for some time, on the one hand to handle all outstanding paperwork, and on the other hand to pay attention to the safety of their expatriates. Originally, once the diplomatic personnel left, the expatriates were like orphans who had lost their milk, and would suffer all kinds of hardships and bullying. There are also several ways to deal with this issue. One is to entrust a neutral country to protect them. Another is the current method of handling British, American, and Japanese expatriates, which is to exchange them between the two sides.

However, according to international law regulations, there are approximately three types of punishments for enemy nationals according to international practice: one is expulsion, two is detention, and three is refusal. (Refusal means not allowing enemy nationals to enter the country after a declaration of war). From the first article, like ordering diplomatic personnel to leave the country, there must be a deadline. However, this deadline cannot be too short, as too short would inevitably appear somewhat vicious and extreme. For example, during the Franco-Prussian War, France only gave three days, ordering all Prussians to withdraw. During the last war, the French government ordered Germans to leave the country, giving only two days, causing the Germans to flee in a hurry.

As for the issue of detention, there was no precedent in the nineteenth century. Although Napoleon detained 10,000 Englishmen during the Anglo-French War in 1803, Napoleon did not acknowledge that this was detaining enemy nationals, but rather a retaliatory measure, because Britain had detained two French merchant ships before the declaration of war.

However, there must also be some deliberation between expulsion and detention. For example, in today's situation, manpower is an extremely important factor in war. If everyone is expelled, wouldn't that be deliberately causing the enemy country to add a vote of labor or military strength? Moreover, there may be some important figures or outstanding geniuses among them. If they are released, it would be like adding wings to a tiger. But when it comes to detention, you have to provide them with all food. At today's prices, rice sells for five or six hundred yuan per dan, and White Pagoda Oil is eighty yuan per pound, and it is as rare as phoenix feathers and unicorn horns, and cannot be found. How can you afford to supply these expatriates in the hundreds or thousands?

Detention is also very troublesome in terms of management. The host country has to send considerable manpower to supervise them. According to procedure, those detained should not engage in conduct detrimental to the host country. If they do, they should be punished on charges of espionage. But when there are a large number of people, even if the detention area has a certain range, how can it be monitored everywhere?

Therefore, the recent rumors of the Japanese side exchanging expatriates with the British and Americans is a wise measure. According to news from May 15th, next month, over a thousand British and American expatriates will set sail from Shanghai on the scheduled Japanese ship Tatsuta Maru and the Italian ship Conte Verde to East African Portuguese territory to exchange with Japanese expatriates. This should be realized. Square in front of the Lisbon Independence Monument.

### First Batch of Citizen Certificates for the Public Concession Expected to be Issued Next Week; Completion and Issuance Handled by Each Police Station

In order to simplify the procedures for the replacement of citizen certificates, the Public Concession Police Department's Baojia Section has assigned the direct handling of this matter to the Baojia system of each police station and has abolished the office of the department that specializes in issuing citizen certificates. Completed citizen certificates have already been sealed and are scheduled to be sent today, along with blank citizen certificates, to the Central, Chengdu Road, Jing'an Temple, Gordon Road, Putuo Road, and Xinzha police stations. The Laozha police station, due to its dense population, did not send the application forms to the Baojia Section. Now that the issuance is handled directly by each police station, there is no need to send them in again. It is found that the first batch of citizen certificates that have now been completed can generally be issued by each police station to the Lianbao Chiefs next week, who will then issue them to the Bao Chiefs, who will then issue them to the Jia Chiefs, and then distribute them to the heads of each household and residents.

### Bureau Rice Price to Increase Tomorrow

The Municipal Council announces, "From May 24th of this year (Sunday) until the date specified in another announcement, the highest retail price of rice for this bureau shall be three yuan and eight jiao in half a liter of new legal currency, or six yuan and three jiao in old legal currency, at the option of the buyer."

### Milkfat and Flour to be Rationed Separately; Those Receiving Artificial Milkfat Must Also Apply for Registration

According to information released by the Municipal Council Information Office, the Public Concession, French Concession, and Huxi authorities hereby announce to the public that the fourth coupon for milkfat rationing cards has been extended, as announced today. Please take note. This extension is due to circumstances beyond the control of the two municipal authorities, which is deeply regrettable. It is hoped that a satisfactory agreement can be reached soon and the distribution measures can be continued. No further user registration will be accepted at this time. Those holding the second coupon may purchase from the retail store listed on the coupon during normal business hours today (Saturday, May 23rd). Regarding the supply of artificial milkfat, users must also register. Although there is public sale on the market at present, the authorities have also decided to implement restrictive measures. Only genuinely registered users will be allowed to purchase. The authorities also want the public to pay close attention to this. Applicants may send their applications to any of the following locations: Post Office Box 597, Office for the Control of Prices, French Municipal Council, No. 2 Fuxing Road. For detailed information on registration, please refer to this bureau's announcement No. 5875 of April 28th of this year. As for the flour rationing method, an agreement has now been reached. Those holding flour rationing cards for May may use the two flour coupons attached to the card to purchase 5 pounds each of flour and cornflour from the food stores and department stores designated by the authorities. The names of these food stores and department stores were announced on the 19th of this month. The public is also requested to pay close attention.

### Impersonating Investigators to Swindle Rice Money; Do Not Trust Easily

A clothing store owner in the French Concession recently inquired with the Central Police Station of the French Concession about the results of his application for rice. It was claimed that a certain Li Heming, claiming to be an employee of the Grain and Food Price Management Section, had the store hand over a blank application form, saying that he would come to collect it after it was filled out. In reality, this application form was different from the one prescribed by the French authorities, and there was clearly no doubt that it was a preparatory act of fraud. After investigation by the police, Li Heming and accomplices were apprehended. They had impersonated investigators from the Grain and Food Price Management Section of the French Concession and told five Chinese stores in the concession that if they were willing to pay a reward, they could supply rice. They also claimed to have discovered several bags of rice hidden somewhere, and defrauded them of 600 yuan on the pretext of secretly storing rice. Of course, these people had no rice to supply to others. As they said, they were just swindling others out of money. The offenders have all been questioned and will be interrogated on the 29th of this month. It is hoped that members of the public, when encountering someone claiming to be dispatched by the authorities, will carefully examine their identity documents and inquire about their origins, and not trust them easily.

### Bank Deposits Should be Withdrawn Quickly

The Chosen Bank, which is liquidating the British Yieh United Bank in this port, announced yesterday that Yieh United Bank has been issuing the first batch of deposits of 2,000 yuan to depositors since the 4th. Many days have passed since then, and the majority of depositors have gone to withdraw their money. However, some depositors have not yet gone to withdraw their money and should complete the withdrawal procedures as soon as possible.

### Foreign Baojia Section Established in the Municipal Council Police Department

Implemented simultaneously with the Chinese Baojia System; Annual Budget Exceeds 70,000 Yuan

The Public Concession Municipal Council Police Department will establish a foreign Baojia Section, under the Foreign Affairs Section of the Special Department, to be implemented simultaneously with the Chinese Baojia Section. The total cost is estimated at 71,390 yuan in savings currency, which will be allocated from the 2,373,896 yuan approved by the Municipal Council for the 1942 Baojia budget. The personnel for this section include one Japanese police officer, two Western police chiefs, and four Chinese staff members. Each police chief will be paid 1,200 yuan per month, and each Chinese staff member will be paid 300 yuan per month.

The total Baojia expenditure for the Suzhou River area of the Public Concession for this year is estimated at 2,373,896 yuan, of which 2,302,506 yuan is allocated to the Chinese Baojia Section and only 71,390 yuan to the Foreign Baojia Section. The salaries of the Chinese Section's staff total 940,800 yuan, while the salaries of the Foreign Section total 57,600 yuan. The budget for the equipment of both sections is estimated at 63,380 yuan, the equipment for the Self-Defense Corps is 38,290 yuan, and the cost of establishing watchtowers, obstacles, and alarm bells is 1,125,550 yuan. The remaining 148,375 yuan will be used to purchase stationery and other items.

Although the Municipal Council has already approved the Baojia expenditure for this year, if various sectors wish to make voluntary donations to improve various self-defense facilities, they can send them directly to the Finance Department of the Municipal Council at No. 209 Jiangxi Road. Do not have them collected and transferred by private individuals. If money has been prepaid by someone for the purchase of furniture and equipment, a letter should be sent to the Chief Superintendent for consultation with the Municipal Council for reimbursement. The Baojia system run by the Police Department is divided into Chinese and Western sections. The Chinese Baojia Section has a general office responsible for issuing citizen certificates and managing the entire general affairs. Branch offices are also set up in each police station, responsible for the household survey in each district. Personnel from each police station assist in contacting the Bao chiefs in each district. The entire concession is divided into two zones, A and B. Zone A includes the Central, Laozha, and Chengdu Road districts, and Zone B includes the Xinzha, Jing'an Temple, Gordon, and Putuo Road districts. The Chinese Section has two Japanese police chiefs, each with a monthly salary of 1,200 yuan, two Chinese police chiefs, each with a monthly salary of 800 yuan, and 248 staff members, each with a monthly salary of 300 yuan. The organization of the Western Baojia Section has been described above. Its work is similar to that of the Chinese Section, but its scope is different.

### Ningbo Natives in Shanghai Sending Coffins Back to Hometown; A Batch Can Be Loaded Every Three or Four Days

The number of Ningbo natives in Shanghai requesting registration to send coffins back to Ningbo at the Siming Public Association's Guohua Funeral Parlor has been very enthusiastic recently. It is learned that the authorities have designated that starting on the 27th of this month, shipments will begin on various ships. The first shipment will be handled by the Changshan Maru (Taikoo Wharf). After that, a batch can be loaded every three or four days. Today, Guohua issued an urgent announcement, notifying those who have registered to go through all the loading and shipping procedures within two days. All expenses, as well as the guarantee, shipping manifest, etc., must be completed. Family members escorting the coffin who must return to Shanghai should prepare four photos, and the office will apply for a special round-trip certificate on their behalf. Those who have not registered should contact them as soon as possible, as the deadline may be very short.

### Insufficient Sales Quantity: Business Community Seeks Remedy

Repeated Weighing and Verification, No Fear of Tedium; Situation of Short Weight Possibly Eliminated

Regarding the recent incident of a company being fined for insufficient sales quantity, yesterday, responsible individuals from several major department stores claimed that they could guarantee that the same situation would not occur again in the future. They stated that their companies have adopted the most cautious methods to check and verify orders from manufacturers, ensuring that the quality and quantity are correct. This way, when selling to customers, issues such as quantity shortages can be avoided. Customers can obtain the most substantial goods, and companies can avoid the loss of being fined. Previously, the Wing On Company was fined forty yuan for selling Swan brand white sugar in insufficient quantities. According to an explanation from an employee of the company, the occurrence of this unfortunate incident should be attributed to the manufacturer, not the company, because when the company received the order, it only conducted a general verification, and the small packages were not checked before being sold, which led to the discovery of the quantity shortage. Now, whenever the Wing On Company receives goods, regardless of size, it conducts strict inspections. First, the entire batch is weighed, and then it is estimated in installments. Although the procedure is cumbersome, it is essential. Previously, when the company purchased goods from manufacturers and sold them, there was no concern about quantity shortages. Recently, manufacturers have been quite negligent in shipping goods, causing difficulties for the selling companies. Other major companies are now inspecting incoming goods with their own scales to verify the quantity before proceeding, so that both the company and its customers can benefit. It is reported that the authorities recently reminded citizens to observe carefully when purchasing food at various stores, as some unscrupulous merchants often take advantage of customers' carelessness to sell goods in insufficient quantities.

### Violent Temper: Beating a Beggar to Death

Cai Yongqing, a Tongzhou native residing at No. 10, Wu'anfang Lane, is known for his violent temper. The day before yesterday, around 5 p.m., an approximately thirty-year-old man in rags came begging. Cai suspected him of stealing items, slapped him twice, and punched him in the chest, causing him to fall to the ground, barely breathing. The patrolling police arrived and sent the man to the hospital for treatment, but he died en route. The body was taken to the Jiaozhou Road mortuary for examination. Cai Yongqing was taken to the Huishi police station and charged with causing death by injury.

### French Concession April: Health Report

Typhoid Fever Expected to Run Rampant This Summer

The French Municipal Council's Health Department recently released its health report for April, stating that typhoid fever is expected to be rampant this summer. Typhoid fever has been on the rise since the beginning of this year. Among foreigners, although cases of epidemic typhus slightly decreased last month, the mortality rate reached 30%, indicating that it remains a serious danger. The number of Chinese people suffering from epidemic typhus is also increasing daily, exceeding the record for the same month last year. As for the general health situation in the French Concession in April, the total number of illnesses and the overall mortality rate have decreased, and the total number of patients is fewer than in the same month last year, but the number of deaths is slightly higher. The number of corpses collected by the Tongren Fuyuantang last month increased by 25% compared to the same month last year. Cases of smallpox have slightly increased, with three Chinese people suffering from smallpox, two of whom died as a result. The report continued to describe the vaccination efforts in the French Concession. The total number of injections in April was 150,483. The smallpox vaccination program was slightly delayed due to the preventative injections, but 15,149 people were vaccinated last month, bringing the total number of people vaccinated this year to 180,926. The number of people receiving typhoid fever preventative injections was 1,646. The danger posed by typhoid fever became more serious last month. In addition, the French Health Department conducts regular disinfection of rickshaws and rickshaw pullers. In April, 3,834 people underwent health inspections, and 1,562 pieces of clothing and 3,452 rickshaw wheels were disinfected.

### General Situation of Shanghai's Book Industry Amidst the Flames of War

Very Few New Books Due to the Impact of the Situation; However, Business Can Still Maintain the Status Quo

Yesterday, a gentleman familiar with the situation of the book industry in the city told this reporter that Shanghai has always been the cultural center of the country, with numerous bookstores. The textbooks, reference books, periodicals, and even stationery and instruments used by large and small schools are mostly supplied by bookstores in the city. After August 13th, some bookstores suffered significant losses because their factories were located in Zhabei or Hongkou and were affected by the war. However, business can generally maintain the status quo. Therefore, most of the books needed in the city and the Yangtze River basin are still edited and printed by bookstores in the city, and the books needed in the southwestern provinces are printed by the Hong Kong branches or sub-bureaus of bookstores in the city. In addition, they can be sold to various parts of Southeast Asia, which is very profitable.

High Costs Slightly Increase Prices

Since December 8th of last year, the business situation of bookstores in the city has changed significantly. The reason is that some books are related to current affairs, which makes it impossible to publish them. Paper is also one of the controlled goods, and transportation is very inconvenient. Moreover, even if new books are published, they are difficult to sell because of the high costs, which are beyond the purchasing power of general readers. Therefore, the publication of new books can be said to have completely stopped. All bookstores are now selling their inventory to maintain their businesses. The categories include literature, medicine, health, technology, science, children's books, rubbings, and calligraphy. The selling price is 40% to 50% higher than the original price. If calculated at the current paper prices, the increase can be said to be minimal. The sale of these books will continue until the inventory is sold out. Each bookstore is not yet prepared to plan and print new books. For most books, such as series, there will be no immediate reprint after they are sold out.

Employees' Lives Become Increasingly Difficult

Major bookstores are struggling to maintain the status quo because their businesses cannot be expanded. Most of them have reduced staff or cut salaries, and have stopped providing vehicles, medical subsidies, children's education, and subsidies to employees. Many employees continue to work, but because the cost of living is increasing daily, they cannot bear the pressure and have resigned or engaged in small businesses to supplement their income. Their lives are extremely difficult. Fortunately, the employees are well aware of the difficulties currently facing the book industry, and are very understanding of the employer's treatment, which has prevented the occurrence of labor disputes, which is fortunate.

Stock Prices Are Quite Good

Of the losses suffered by the Commercial Press and the Chung Hwa Book Company, the Commercial Press suffered more. This is because the late general manager of the Chung Hwa Book Company, Lufei Bohong, fearing that the Second European War would extend to the Pacific, ordered a large amount of paper, ink, etc. from abroad and quickly printed them into books after the goods arrived, selling them to various places. After the outbreak of the Pacific War, the Chung Hwa Book Company still had a considerable amount of paper in Shanghai, which has been permitted to be sold. Part of the proceeds are used to dismiss workers and employees, and the treatment is quite good. Moreover, its factories are all located within the concession, and have not suffered losses during the Shanghai war, which is also one of the reasons for its better situation. The Commercial Press, on the other hand, has purchased less paper in the past two or three years, intending to avoid suspicion of hoarding. Although its business is slightly affected by the current situation, its stock prices are still very good, probably because the museum has a long history, a large scale, and real estate distributed in various provinces, so it will not be difficult to restore its original state after the situation is stabilized. In addition, bookstores such as World, Datung, and Kaiming have also suffered considerable losses, but the situations are different. Among them, the World Book Company has a very solid asset base, and the price of stationery has skyrocketed, so the value of its stock is particularly high.

Students Feel Increasingly Burdened

After the operations of large bookstores are affected, small bookstores are also hit hard. This is because most small bookstores do not print books themselves, and rely on selling books published by major bookstores to make a profit. Now that major bookstores have mostly stopped publishing new books, the source of books will inevitably be difficult. Therefore, many small bookstores have changed to selling stationery. Recently, the selling price of various stationery has also increased sharply, making it increasingly difficult for students of all levels to bear, which is a distorted phenomenon in the cultural world.

### Fifteen-Year-Old Boy Actually Participated in Robbery

Reflection of the Pressure of Life

A certain Western clothing store at No. 167, Xiafei Road, was suddenly invaded by five or six armed bandits on the evening of the day before yesterday (the 19th). More than 20 sets of Western suits worth more than 20,000 yuan were robbed. The store owner reported to the French police to investigate. The next day, Xie Guangming, the Chinese inspector of the French police, and detectives Weng Huanzhang and Guo Shaorong received a tip that several members of the gang were hiding in Room 57 of the Sān Péng Hotel in Yúqìng Lane, Bālǐ Bridge Street, Xīnxīn Bridge. They immediately led a team of detectives to the hotel, arrested twelve bandits, and found three pistols under the bed. They were taken to the police station. After interrogation, they confessed to robbing more than ten Western clothing stores and other businesses. They also issued arrest warrants for the remaining accomplices who were at large. The strangest thing is that among the gang, there was a boy of only fifteen years old who participated in the robbery, which shows the severity of the pressure of life.

### Solving All Problems: Shanghai Municipal Council's New Organization (6) 3. Rent Dispute Mediation Committee

Actual Staff

On January 7th, the Shanghai Municipal Council announced the list of committee members as follows:

G. G. Goldthwaite (Chairman) - Chuan Liang
B. A. Bretschneider - Li Zhishan
P. Brunet - Li Shuxiong

Among the six people, Chairman Goldthwaite is its guiding light and driving force. He is extremely enthusiastic about the work of the committee and dedicates most of his time to solving problems and improving efficiency. He is an expert linguist, fluent in several languages. He is a tower of strength and the foundation of the entire structure.

Among the other committee members, Brunet is a technical specialist in engineering. Bo Liang and Li Zhishan handle all legal aspects of each case. Bretschneider and Li Shuxiong are well-known figures in the business community.

Public Service

Here, a little-known fact should be pointed out. None of the above people received any compensation for undertaking this difficult work and heavy responsibility. These are purely honorary positions, and they have contributed most of their valuable time for an ideal of service.

The Rent Dispute Mediation Committee is a bold attempt that has achieved remarkable success. Its achievements have convinced the world today that no municipal authority can be without such a mediation committee. It has established itself as an indispensable asset, helping the Shanghai Municipal Council work to improve the living environment of the people of Shanghai.

It is said that all the trivial matters of the committee are currently handled by the legal department of the Municipal Council. Therefore, all disputes between landlords and tenants should first be sent to the legal department, which will then forward them to the Mediation Committee for review.

Legal Limitations

It is also pointed out that the committee can only mediate disputes between landlords and tenants, and has no power to intervene in disputes between second landlords and third tenants.

It is also said that when a tenant refuses to pay rent, the landlord may request the Mediation Committee to review the matter. If a tenant is unable to pay the agreed rent due to economic reasons, he may also submit it to the committee. The committee will consider whether the rent should be reduced, temporarily suspended, or paid in full.

Another point that should be clarified is that the Mediation Committee is not a judicial body and cannot overturn the rulings of the competent courts. Therefore, it cannot intervene in cases that have already been tried by the courts.

### Sudden Changes in Shuangma Factory Due to Profit Taking

The cotton yarn market initially rose and then weakened. This was because the continuous sharp rise had led to some profit-taking, and the market then turned to stabilize. However, spot goods are based on solid foundations due to high raw material prices, so speculative transactions cannot be treated the same. 42-count Lanfeng was 18,500 yuan, falling to 17,300 yuan, and the closing price was 17,900 yuan. 42-count Shuiyue was 17,200 yuan, 42-count Lima was 17,200 yuan, 42-count Yanghe was 17,500 yuan, 42-count Wuzi was 30,000 yuan, 32-count Xiantao was 15,500 yuan, 60-count Lima was 20,700 yuan, 40-count Caiqiu was 16,300 yuan, 40-count Riguang was 16,400 yuan, 20-count Lanfeng was 10,500 yuan, falling to 10,200 yuan, 20-count Shuangma was 9,540 yuan, 20-count Shuiyue was 10,000 yuan, 20-count Shuangma was 9,200 yuan to 9,350 yuan, and the closing price was 9,000 yuan. 20-count Shuangdiqiu was 9,400 yuan to 9,000 yuan, 16-count Hongshuangma was 7,250 yuan to 7,100 yuan, 10-count Tongzijun was 7,100 yuan to 7,000 yuan, 10-count Jinqiao was 7,100 yuan, 16-count Hongkui was 9,000 yuan. The initial opening price for the 20-count Shuangma factory order was 8,500 yuan, which soon rose to 8,750 yuan. Unexpectedly, as soon as the first order appeared, the speculators from nearly seven yarn factories had made huge profits and unanimously sold off in large quantities. The market loosened, and the market fell sharply to 7,950 yuan. Such a situation was very frightening, but the speculators were still excited. The closing price was 8,000 yuan. In the afternoon, rumors spread that there would be changes in the Old French currency and the Central Reserve Bank currency, and the market price rose again to 8,700 yuan.

### Cotton Cloth Rapidly Declines and Rises Sharply

Longtou Cloth Breaks the 400 Yuan Mark

Factory Cloth Yesterday, the cloth market fell in the morning and rose in the afternoon, reaching a new high. The shouting of prices was chaotic to the extreme. The reason was that in the afternoon, the Central Reserve Bank coupons and military notes rose wildly, causing people to panic and scour the market for spot goods. The prices of coarse and fine cloths rose by 20 to 30 yuan per bolt. The final transaction price for 16-pound Feihong coarse cloth was 324 yuan, 12-pound Diqiu fine cloth was 310 yuan, Fugui fine cloth was 302 yuan, Taohua Nvshi Lin was 443 yuan, Chuji was 441 yuan, and Jinbang Le was 435 yuan in the morning, rising to 440 to 443 yuan in the afternoon.

### Currency Prices Change Repeatedly, Raw Gold Greatly Increases

Soared to 27,500 Yuan in the Afternoon

Yesterday, the black market price of cash gold rose sharply again, breaking through the 15,000 yuan mark. The reason was that the Central Reserve Bank coupons and French currency were repeatedly unpegged, and the discount rate for drafts (per thousand yuan) was above 100 yuan. The soaring of military notes and other currencies caused people to panic and stand firm. The price per tael (ten taels) opened at 25,000 yuan in the morning amidst buying, up 1,400 yuan. Qian Dui Ye made a bid of 25,100 yuan. Securities companies (on behalf of the Tianjin gang) sold forcefully, and a certain gold shop sold down to 24,700 yuan. Another gold shop and a certain gang and Qian Dui Ye bought even better. Two other securities firms absorbed, and the price soared by 1,200 yuan, reaching an unprecedented high of 25,900 yuan. The Securities Gang and Tianjin Gang sold again, and a certain gold shop supplied generously, falling sharply by 1,100 yuan, making a minimum of 24,800 yuan. Another securities firm and a cash firm absorbed, and the price rose by 500 yuan at noon, with the closing price at 25,300 yuan, up 1,700 yuan compared to the previous day. There was a high and low of 1,200 yuan on the day, and the trading was quite active. In the afternoon, the price rose again to 27,500 yuan, with demand exceeding supply, due to rumors of further changes in the French currency.

The price of jewelry gold was raised five times by new firms in the industry, for a total increase of 300 yuan, to 2,700 yuan (200 yuan less for purchases). Refined silver was listed at 18 yuan, and the black market price had risen to 17 yuan. Silver coins were said to be 10 yuan, 2 jiao and 3 fen each.

### Military Notes Exceed the 10 Yuan Mark

Yesterday's foreign currency market saw British and American gold pounds rise by 30 yuan each. The former reached a high of 560 yuan, and the latter reached a high of 570 yuan. US dollar notes also rose to 38 and 39 yuan. Hong Kong notes rose to 5 yuan, 2 jiao and 3 fen. Military notes once exceeded the 10 yuan mark, reaching a high of 10 yuan and 1 jiao, and finally at 9 yuan and 9 jiao, a sharp increase of 1 yuan, 2 jiao and a half compared to the previous day.

Yesterday, the discount rate for the Qianye Gonghui was still listed at 1 jiao and 5 fen. The discount rate for drafts was raised from 85 yuan to 105 yuan per thousand yuan, an increase of 25 yuan. The difference in price between the Central Reserve Bank coupons and the French currency was 6 jiao and 7 jiao for cash, and 7 jiao in the morning for remittances, falling to a minimum of 6 jiao and 8 fen, and then rising to a maximum of 9 jiao and a half, with a final price of 9 jiao. The price for cash was 6 jiao and 8 fen and 7 jiao and 3 fen, which was the buying and selling price for operators.

### Public Bonds Luckily Have Substantial Support

The over-the-counter market for public bonds felt increasingly stable yesterday. Major holders sold over one million, but the market never showed signs of decline. Ren Chang was the first to sell at a low opening price. For example, Class C bonds opened at five yuan, with only a few transactions. The next price was six yuan, showing the eagerness of buyers, unmatched by others. Despite the surge in sales, it was like pouring water on a fire. The reason is that the difference between "clearing house" and cash was less than 10%, and public bonds were settled using "clearing house" without further discounting at a rate of 88%. Moreover, the use of "clearing house" is now minimal. With prices of goods soaring day and night, the unique decline of public bonds seemed illogical. Therefore, financial circles seized the opportunity to widely acquire them, which was not without reason. Yesterday, Ren Chang started the pricing, and there was some dispute regarding Class C bonds, which eventually opened at five yuan. However, due to the large number of buyers in the market, the next price was called at six yuan. Tong Kang Fu sold some, followed by Tong Li's large-scale selling. Hu He Ji, Hong Da, Wu He, Bao Long, and Jiu Feng also sold. Amidst such extensive selling, the buying frenzy of Tong Shun and Lian Yi was sufficient to absorb it. Additionally, Zhong Fu, Yong Kang, Xie Kang Cheng Kang, Tong Yuan, Hong Xing, Run De, and general retail investors were all actively buying. The market price showed no signs of weakness at the close. The strength of the bullish side was evident. As a result, Class A bonds remained unchanged, Class B bonds slightly decreased by three cents, while Class C and E bonds rose by five, five, or nine cents, showing that high pressure was ineffective. The transaction volume was about 1.6 to 1.7 million yuan. A simplified table is provided below:

| Category | Highest | Lowest | Closing | Compared to Previous Day |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Unified A | 3.60 | 62.80 | 62.80 | 3.20 (Flat) |
| Unified B | 57.40 | 56.50 | 56.50 | Down 0.30 |
| Unified C | 56.80 | 55.0 | 56.50 | Up 0.50 |
| Unified - | 50.60 | 49.00 | 50.20 | Up 0.90 |
| Unified E | 52.00 | 51.50 | 52.20 | Up 0.10 |

Yesterday, Chinese stocks were affected by the fluctuations of new and old legal tender, and the rising trend expanded. New Asia Pharmacy (New) stood out, exceeding 40 yuan, with the highest price at 11.25 yuan, later at 11 yuan. Sino-French (New) reached a maximum of 69 yuan, later at 68.5 yuan.

### Wheat Bran Hoarding Strengthens the Market

Price Increases by Five to Six Yuan. Soybean Cake Hoarders Also Active.

The wheat bran market was quite stable yesterday. Due to the repeated reductions in Central Reserve Bank notes, people's confidence continued to rise, hoarding increased, and prices rose by five to six yuan. Three Stars large-bag wheat bran was traded at 200 bags for 120 yuan, and small-bag wheat bran was traded at 600 bags. The April warehouse receipt price was 115-116 yuan, and the May end warehouse receipt price was 121-123 yuan.

The soybean market slightly strengthened yesterday. However, due to the approaching mold season, buyers were still not eager, and the market was difficult to revitalize. The market conditions were generally similar to the previous day. Sangyuan soybeans were traded at 140 bags for 112 yuan, self-pickup. Pinghu Du beans were traded at 20 bags for 250 yuan, self-pickup. Red beans were traded at 21 bags for 222 yuan. Chongming sand red beans were traded at 5,000 bags for 223 yuan, delivered. Jiangbei beans were traded at 40 bags for 185 yuan, self-pickup.

Corn prices rose yesterday due to the high price of wheat bran, with prices increasing by about two yuan compared to the previous day. Four truckloads of Wuhu corn were traded at 184 yuan, and spot was traded at 171-173 yuan.

The soybean cake market saw investors actively absorbing large quantities amidst favorable buying sentiment, leading to a sharp rise in prices, with a consistent increase of six to seven yuan. Li Zi cake's March new warehouse receipt was traded at 500 pieces for 73 yuan. The May new warehouse receipt was traded at 1,000 pieces for 76 yuan.

The April new warehouse receipt was traded at 7,500 pieces for 73 to 79 yuan.

### Firewood and Soap Are Remarkably Popular

The selling prices of daily necessities strongly follow the rise in the cigarette market. Generally, the drastic financial changes are causing various parties to actively pull in real goods from the market, resulting in soaring prices with no end in sight. Phoenix brand was priced at 6,100 yuan, Beauty brand at 6,200 yuan, Golden Tripod brand at 5,200 yuan, Gu Ben soap at 420 yuan per box, Bai Xiang Mao soap at 360 yuan, and Huang Xiang Mao soap at 325 yuan. All goods were priced higher than the previous day.

### Cigarette Prices Continue to Rise

Cigarette prices are soaring due to the continuous rise of military notes and Central Reserve Bank notes, causing extreme panic. Everyone is sparing no effort to search the market for various goods, leading to skyrocketing prices. The trading prices are: Great Britain brand at 11,700 yuan, Old Knife brand at 8,500 yuan, Pin Hai brand at 6,550 yuan, Little Fairy brand at 5,700 yuan, and Five China brand at 5,250 yuan, all of which have increased by 200 to 400 yuan compared to the previous day. Japanese cigarettes are particularly popular. Golden Gun brand is priced at 1,550 yuan, Golden Building brand at 3,150 yuan, Red Rose brand at 1,950 yuan, Quan Lu brand at 3,000 yuan, and Guide brand at 2,000 yuan. 25,000 sticks have also increased by a huge margin of over 200 yuan. The trend is quite tight, and further price increases are possible in the future.

### Agreed Sugar Prices Continue to Rise

Sugar prices are rising as military notes reach new peaks. Calculated using "clearing house" notes, the highest prices are 662-663 yuan for coarse white and cotton white sugar, and nearly 620 yuan for Dutch red sugar. Calculated in cash, coarse and cotton white sugar are 587 yuan, and Dutch red sugar is about 549 yuan.

### Opening Price of Shui Dong Branches Slightly Loosened

Due to the long storage of the Shui Dong branch company's goods and the weather conditions, the quality has changed, with some mold and worms mixed in. Therefore, the opening price has decreased by dozens of yuan, but it is still slightly higher than the low price by 20 yuan. After the company opens, it is necessary to carefully sort through them before selling, so the company's price cannot be too cheap.

### Ningbo Jellyfish Skin and Head Both Rise

The jellyfish head and skin produced in Ningbo have recently seen rising market prices due to scarce arrivals and repeated increases in the discount rate, while sales have also been active. Yesterday, the market price for jellyfish skin was 270 yuan, up 70 yuan from the end of last month. Jellyfish head was 175 yuan, up 40 yuan.

Arts and Entertainment

### Watching the Shanghai Opera School's "Jinshan Temple"

— Zhuo Ran

"Jinshan Temple" is one of the most brilliant scenes in the entire "Legend of the White Snake." The reason why Peking Opera has this play is due to the adaptation of the Kunqu Opera "Yi Yao Zhuan." The role of Bai Suzhen not only emphasizes singing and acting, but also requires a foundation in martial arts. Among the Four Great Dan Actresses, only Qi Xia excels in this play and even performs "Sacrificing the Pagoda." Wan Hua occasionally performed it in her early years during seasonal celebrations. Hui Sheng's adaptation of "Lady White Snake" has already deviated greatly from the original. Yan Qiu has never performed it in Shanghai because the "Water Flooding" fight scene is difficult to master without early training. The reason why "Jinshan Temple" requires a fight scene is that predecessors stipulated that all female demon plays must have fight scenes to demonstrate magic. However, modern martial arts actors often show off their skills with fight scenes, which is a violation of the rules, and this must be attributed to Bai Yu Kun. Bai Yu Kun came from a martial arts background, and his tricks are similar to Tan Xin Pei's technique of stealing Qing Yi (female role) tunes and incorporating them into Lao Sheng (old male role) tunes. Among the younger generation, Song De Zhu, Mao Shi Lai, and Yan Shi Shan are famous for "Jinshan Temple." Song is known for his thrilling performance, Mao for his steady performance, and Yan for his agile performance. All three lack good voices, and their skills are based on the old actors Zhu Gui Fang and Yan Lan Jiu, so they are quite standard. Recently, the Shanghai Opera School also performed this play last Saturday. I was curious and went to watch it. Gu Zheng Qiu's Bai Suzhen and Zhang Zheng Fang's Xiao Qing, in the "Begging for Mercy at Jinshan" scene, sang a large section of Kunqu tunes clearly, and their movements were graceful and pleasing, not inferior to Zhu Chuan Ming in Kunqu troupes. The "Water Flooding" fight scene was performed by three unnamed students. It is said that these three students had only been training for two months and were already able to perform on stage, skillfully wielding double-headed spears and single whips, with calm and steady movements, which is truly rare. Compared to a certain famous actor who drops his weapon three times in a single scene, their glory has far exceeded. However, I don't know the names of these three students. In addition to martial arts, they also have good voices. I sincerely hope that the opera school authorities will provide more training, so that their future is limitless and they will not let Yan Shi Shan and others monopolize the stage. I write this to encourage them.

### Thoughts on "Blood and Sand"

— Er Ming

As the name suggests, this is another film that tells the story of heroic deeds. However, the background here is not the boundless ocean, nor the desert, nor the American continent, but the bullfighting arena in Spain.

Active on the screen is a bullfighter named Juan Gallardo. He rose from humble beginnings to become the most famous bullfighter in Spain. He forgot his childhood sweetheart Carmen, even though he had married her, and was captivated by the seductive noblewoman Dona. As a result, his wife left, his friends abandoned him, his relatives became distant, and Dona was snatched away by Munolo, his childhood companion who had now become one of the most famous bullfighters. Finally, during his last performance, his wife Carmen returned to encourage him and pray for his safety, but unfortunately, he was fatally wounded in this final performance!

The plot is quite tortuous, but the director's technique is not refined enough. The most unfortunate thing is that many of the tense climaxes are shown and obscured in a very bland way, making the second half of the script particularly ordinary and weak. Of course, the acting also bears half the responsibility. Tyrone Power plays Juan Gallardo, and while he has courage, he lacks subtlety. Several reunions and sad scenes are portrayed very ordinarily. Linda Darnell does not have many scenes, and her performance is also mediocre.

Only Rita Hayworth is a very successful member. She plays the seductive noblewoman Dona and is remarkably lifelike, fully expressing the personality of a wanton woman who manipulates men at her fingertips, which feels just right. Another noteworthy aspect is the bullfighting scenes, which are even more magnificent under the rendering of color! The whole play is full of Spanish colors: Spanish scenery, music, and dance, which will give you a novel feeling.

### Opera World News

— Opera Fan

Li Song Ling, chairman of the board, Xu Mu Yun, principal, and Li Qin Xuan, dean of academic affairs of the China National Opera School, have decided to use "Song" as the students' stage names. Therefore, all students are now ranked with the character "Song."

Huang Jin and Li Shi Fang will perform a farewell performance in the coming days. It has not yet been decided whether Ma Lian Liang or Huang Gui Qiu will be in the supporting cast.

Dong Zhao Bin, the owner of the Gengxin Stage, wrote from Beiping, saying that Song Bao Luo, Song Zi Ping, Xue Mei Fang, and others are waiting to receive their travel permits and will be heading south soon.

The tenth installment of "The Eccentric Ouyang De" at the Gongwu Stage will be completed in about three weeks, and then the seasonal play "Legend of the White Snake" will be staged.

Zhao Song Qiao, the backstage manager of Gengxin, intends to resign and go to Hangzhou. The theater has not approved it because his contract still has two months left.

Qilin Tong and his wife often come to the International Tea House for tea in their spare time. They can also be seen riding in rented cars on the road from time to time. Sometimes his wife goes out alone, preferring to take a taxi, but Qilin Tong cannot accompany her.

The Mudan Opera Troupe took the Hua Ping wheel to Nantong yesterday. The main plays are "Fairy Peony and Silver Peony's Farewell My Concubine," "Yu Tang Chun," "Pink Peony and White Peony's Four-Five Flower Cave," "Chun Xiang Teasing Learning," and "Spinning Cotton."

After his contract with Gengxin expired, Xiao Yang Yue Lou went to Zhenjiang yesterday and will perform at the Heping Theater today.

Kun Dan (female role) Zhao Wan Shuang intends to perform in Nanjing after her contract with the Nantong Jiangbei Theater expires at the end of the month.

Kun Dan Cao Hui Lin formally became a student of Fu Rong Cao the other day at noon at the Xin Li Cha Restaurant.

### About "Autumn" and Others

— Feng Huai

Ba Jin can be said to be the most influential writer. After his "Home" and "Spring" were adapted into stage plays, even audiences who never frequented stage plays came to see them, creating a new box office record. Now, the third part of his Torrent Trilogy—"Autumn"—will also be staged at the Lyceum Theater today. The adapter of "Autumn" is Li Jian Wu, the director is Huang Zuo Lin, and the cast includes high-profile artists such as Ying Zi, Shi Hui, Lan Lan, Huang Zong Jiang, and Huang Zong Ying. The performer is the powerful Rong Wei Company. This is undoubtedly a stimulant for drama lovers.

In addition to the Lyceum Theater, Rong Wei Company is also holding a long-term performance at the Longmen Theater. The recently performed plays are "Hong Luan Xi" and "Zhong Fa Bai," two famous comedies. Rong Wei's new plays in preparation are rumored to include "Bi Yi Niao," "Holmes," "The Family of Formos," and "Thunderstorm."

### Brief Account of Little Amateur Actor Xu You Geng

— Mei Hua Ji Zhu

Xu You Geng, the third son of Yu Yun Shan, loved singing at a young age. In just a few years, he has learned more than a dozen plays such as "The Empty City Stratagem," "The Fourth Son Visits His Mother," "Borrowing the East Wind," "Ascending to Heaven Terrace," and "Dingjun Mountain," all taught by famous masters. He occasionally performs on stage, and he does everything in an orderly manner, with lively and colorful performances. Recently, he has been taught the play "Lin Chong's Night Flight" by the Kunqu Opera master Zheng Chuan. The work is complete, and he will perform it next month in a charity play organized by the Shanghai Women and Children Relief Association. It is also said that his "Ascending to Heaven Terrace" was personally taught by the famous actor Yan Ju Peng. (The circle is a photo of Xu You Geng as Zhuge Kongming in "The Empty City Stratagem")

### Scene of the Performing Arts

— Xin Juan

Hu Ti Wei's "Ren Jian Shi" was originally scheduled to be performed by the Shanghai Art Theater. After several consultations, it was finally decided that the China Art Theater would perform it due to actor issues, and Zhu Duan Jun was invited to direct.

The Carlton Theater is currently staging "Plum Blossom Dream" by the Shanghai Art Theater, and the results are very good. It is said that in the near future, Sun Jing Lu, who will be heavily promoted, will perform "Startling Phoenix Flying," written by Gu Zhong and directed by Ma Xu Wei Bang.

Gu Lan Jun and Huang He starred in "Warm Spring in a Foreign Bed" (formerly known as "Love Waves on the Sea"). The final dance scene was filmed at the Lilac Garden the night before last (the 21st).

Amidst the opening of "Shadow of Red Tears," Hu Feng's "Spring Water Love Waves" has also been completed. The new film "Brother and Brother" will begin filming within days, directed by Zheng Xiao Qiu, with Shu Shi and Xu Feng playing the male leads.

Mei Xi has signed a contract with the new company. His first new film is "Grand View Garden on the Sea," co-starring with Gu Lan Jun and directed by Zhu Shi Lin.

Ma Xu Wei Bang's "Opium War" has been temporarily suspended, and it has been decided to direct "Wind and Moon Anecdotes" (originally named "Night Rain in Hanshan") instead.

### (18)

— Li Yan Xiu

I don't know much about Li Yan Xiu's academic career. I only know that she is the daughter of Li Shun Lai, a martial arts actor. So, although Li Yan Xiu is a bit clumsy due to her weight, she is quite skilled in the use of weapons. However, apart from this, her performance in other plays is not only unremarkable, but it also seems that she doesn't know the script of every play." She came to Shanghai that year and performed at Geng Xin for a period, but her reputation was mediocre. In fact, it can be said that she was "not unlucky." Among the Kun Hui (female opera troupe) actors who play Dan (female role), there are two of the fattest: one is Li Yu Ru, and the other is Li Yan Xiu. It is interesting that these two chubby girls both have the surname Li. However, although Li Yu Ru is fat, she is really willing to work hard on stage and really knows how to act. With her cleverness, she is liked by people and her clumsiness is not noticed. In comparison, this chubby Li Yan Xiu is not as good as that chubby Li Yu Ru. (Note that Li Yu Ru's fatness is not as extreme as Li Yan Xiu's, and her facial features are also more elegant than Li Yan Xiu's. This is another reason why one is clumsy and the other is not.)

### Sharing the Same Boat

— He Jia Zhi

(5) Reciprocal Repayment

Guo Fang saw her expression and asked, "Sister Cui Zhen, do you want to say something? If you don't find it difficult to speak, it's good to say it. Keeping your worries in your stomach is also a kind of pain." Cui Zhen lifted a corner of the blanket and rubbed her chest. Guo Fang said, "It's not right for you to be so worried. No matter what you want to say, say it. Although I didn't grow up in the countryside, I consider myself to know more about the ways of the world than my brother. Sister Cui Zhen, I understand you, and Wei Cheng understands you the same way. Sister Cui Zhen, speak." Cui Zhen stared at Guo Fang with her big eyes for a while, and said, "Both my brother Cheng and Miss Chen are children without mothers. Miss Chen is still okay, but brother Cheng and I don't even have fathers." Guo Fang said, "Yes, but this cannot be undone. There's a saying in Chinese: 'The child wants to provide for his parents, but they are no longer there.' It's not that the children want to abandon their parents, but that the parents abandon their children. There are countless orphans without parents in the world." Cui Zhen lay on her side, looking sad, and said, "I'm even worse than brother Cheng. Although he says he has no parents, he still has an aunt who is like a mother, and he still has houses and fields. As for me, I have no houses or fields, but I do have an uncle." Guo Fang said, "Yes, I've heard Wei Cheng say that Sister Cui Zhen has an uncle, but he doesn't seem to care much about you. Logically speaking, an uncle has an undeniable duty to care for his orphaned niece. Like Wei Cheng's uncle, he wouldn't treat his nephew's affairs as someone else's."

Cui Zhen's voice became even lower and said, "He came today, he and his daughter came, who is my cousin." Guo Fang said, "Is that your uncle? I didn't see him. I overlooked Cui Zhen's cousin as well. So, my hospitality was just nominal. Did your uncle say anything when he came?" Cui Zhen said, "My uncle came and probably found the gift registry in the accounting room. When he saw my name and that I had given a ten-dollar gift, he asked his daughter to say to me: Cui Zhen has spare money to send to the dead Granny Ye, but doesn't have money to send to her living uncle. Your uncle wants ten dollars now." Guo Fang said, "Ah! In the mourning hall, there was a girl wearing a floral cloth dress who whispered in your ear, that was your cousin, that's what she said."
