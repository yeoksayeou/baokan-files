Haitong News Agency telegram from the German Führer's headquarters, 28th: Today, the German military report stated that enemy positions on the peaks of Sevastopol were broken by the German-Romanian allied forces. The enemy was forced to abandon the fortress and flee. Our aircraft bombed enemy positions and airfields in the east. A Soviet destroyer south of Feodosia was hit by a large bomb.

Several small merchant ships in the Gulf of Finland were sunk by our aircraft, and some were set on fire after being hit. The railway in the central Laihe River basin was bombed by our aircraft, causing great damage and several fires.

Havas News Agency from Stockholm, Sweden, 27th: It is generally expected that the German army will soon launch another major offensive against Moscow. Therefore, occupying the key railways centered on Moscow will again become the primary objective of the German High Command. As for the northern sector, the German army is engaged in mopping-up operations in the Novgorod region, clearing out the remnants of the Red Army. Once this task is completed, the German army will likely concentrate its efforts on attacking Leningrad. In addition, in the Murmansk region, General Dietl's troops have already begun attacking the Murmansk railway in order to cut off this important Soviet supply line.

Havas News Agency telegram from a certain location in the Ukrainian region, 27th: The Red Army in the port of Sevastopol is currently defending the last line of defense from the coast to the Balaklava road. The German-Romanian allied forces have approached this line. Although the Red Army has launched several counterattacks, the allied forces have held their strongholds northeast of the city firmly. According to Soviet sources, the German troops on the west bank of South Bay have not been able to reach the sea. Although the Red Army has fought hard for twenty days, there are no signs of weakening in terms of manpower or material resources. According to the latest news, three German infantry divisions have arrived from Mariupol to reinforce. As for the Soviet naval landing force that landed at Yelta Port on the 25th, they are still fighting and awaiting assistance from the Allied Navy. In the Kharkov region, the Rostov railway has been cut off by the German army, and fierce battles are taking place east of the line. The German right wing has reached the upper reaches of the Krasnaya River and occupied the city of Pokrovskaya. General Timoshenko's main force has withdrawn and is setting up new positions to continue resisting. The situation in the Volchansk district has stabilized, and the Red Army is currently covering the main force's retreat to the rear. As for General Bock's troops, they are continuing to advance south from the cities of Kupiansk and Izyum, their objective being to force the Red Army to retreat. Therefore, the battle of the Caucasus can effectively be considered to have already begun.

Haitong News Agency telegram from Berlin, 28th: According to German military sources, German aircraft concentrated their attacks on enemy troops east of the Oskol River yesterday, strafing at low altitude, inflicting heavy casualties on the Soviet army. German light bombers attacked railways in the Soviet rear, achieving considerable success, with multiple trains being hit and catching fire.

### Washington Talks Concluded; Churchill Flies Back to London; Immediately Convening Wartime Cabinet Meeting and Plans to Address the Nation in a Broadcast Speech

Havas News Agency telegram from London, 27th: British Prime Minister Churchill returned here today. Deputy Prime Minister Attlee, Lord Privy Seal Cripps, Soviet Ambassador to Britain Maisky, Chongqing Ambassador to Britain Gu Weijun, and British Cabinet officials welcomed him. Upon returning to London, Churchill immediately convened a wartime cabinet meeting and planned to deliver a broadcast address to the nation, reporting on the trip. He is also preparing a speech to respond to the motion of no confidence in the House of Commons. Furthermore, while in the U.S., Churchill maintained contact with the Foreign Office via telephone. His rapid return was unexpected. It is reported that he traveled back and forth on a British giant seaplane, the world's largest commercial aircraft, weighing 40 tons, 35 meters long, with a wingspan of 45 meters, and 8 meters high, equipped with four engines totaling 6,400 horsepower, capable of carrying 66 passengers and 10 crew members.

Havas News Agency telegram from the capital of Switzerland, 27th: Newspapers here recently carried London news stating that the House of Commons will likely request that Churchill remain Prime Minister, but must resign from the post of Minister of Defense. Furthermore, according to the Neue Zürcher Zeitung, the British people greatly admire Prime Minister Churchill but believe that the government must streamline and select talented and capable individuals to fill important positions. In addition, a Geneva newspaper reporter also wired that "although Britain has encountered a truly serious juncture on the battlefield, there is no political crisis to speak of."

Haitong News Agency telegram from Lisbon, 28th: According to the London "Daily Express," the British House of Lords will also debate the war situation. Lord Addison will propose a motion focusing on the overall war situation and the North African and Mediterranean campaigns.

Anglo-American Declaration

Havas News Agency telegram from Washington, 27th: The talks held by Prime Minister Churchill and President Roosevelt over the past few days concluded yesterday. Prime Minister Churchill immediately flew back to London. A joint Anglo-American declaration was simultaneously issued in London and Washington, stating: 1. Prime Minister Churchill and President Roosevelt conducted talks this time, lasting a week. The President and Prime Minister comprehensively studied the major issues arising from the operations of the Allied forces on various continents and seas. They were fully aware of each other's advantages and did not underestimate each other's strengths. The strength and resources of the other party were fully taken into account during the talks. In the future, Britain and the U.S. will do their utmost to step up wartime production. 2. In view of the length of the battle lines, they are keenly aware that mobilizing troops and transporting military equipment are major issues that the Allied forces must address. In addition, the Axis powers are engaged in submarine warfare, causing significant losses to our merchant ships. Therefore, both countries should make maximum efforts to develop the shipbuilding industry. 3. "The British and American are deeply admire the "heroic resistance" of the Soviet troops."

Haitong News Agency telegram from Stockholm, Sweden, 28th:

After Churchill returned to London, Washington and London simultaneously issued a communiqué, stating that the actions and plans of the British and American governments could not be disclosed, which was obvious. However, it can be asserted that the war plans discussed at the Washington meeting will disperse the German forces attacking the Soviet Union. The friendly cooperation between Britain and the U.S. is in complete agreement on the plans and views for achieving victory. The British and American navies will reduce the losses of merchant ships, and the details have been discussed by military advisors. The joint communiqué stated that Roosevelt and Churchill had met twice in August and December 1941. At the recent meeting, the hope of victory has increased even more.

Berlin Commentary

Haitong News Agency telegram from Berlin, 28th: Berlin commented last night on the documents released by London and Washington, stating that since Marshal Rommel has put Egypt in a new position, Churchill no longer dares to exaggerate and make promises. This statement is clearly different from those released after the previous two meetings because at a time of such a crushing defeat, it is impossible to announce future victory. It is particularly noteworthy that the statement does not mention the air force and the predictions that Britain and the U.S. will soon control the skies. Another omission is the lack of any mention of the "Second Front" issue. The statement solemnly declares that the lack of ships and the difficulty of transportation make it impossible to transport military supplies to the Soviet Union on a large scale and establish a second front. There is no mention of the Libyan second front, which has been effectively established for a year. The statements regarding dealing with Japan and assisting China are also very vague. There is no mention of whether any practical measures were decided at this meeting. The statements regarding hindering the German forces from fully attacking the Soviet Union are also very ambiguous. According to the New York Sun, the arrival of the U.S. commander-in-chief of the European theater in Britain can be seen as the establishment of a second front.

Haitong News Agency telegram from Lisbon, 28th: According to news received here, Churchill visited U.S. military exercises in the southern U.S. during his visit to the U.S. At that time, U.S. Secretary of War Stimson, Chief of Staff General Marshall, and many senior British and American military officers accompanied him. Churchill was deeply impressed by the realistic nature of the exercises.

### Egypt is of Great Importance to Britain

Haitong News Agency telegram from Lisbon, 28th: The "Daily Express" states that if Britain loses Egypt, it will lose the Mediterranean and Britain will be reduced to a third-rate power. However, Britain has not made the greatest sacrifices to defend Egypt. If German troops drive British troops out of the Egyptian coast, Germany will have six major benefits: (1) Turkey will be isolated, and German troops can control the Black Sea and the Dardanelles Strait, and the transportation of products from the Balkan Peninsula can also be changed to sea routes. (2) The Suez Canal cannot be defended, opening up a road to the Mosul oil fields for German troops. (3) A large amount of food in North Africa will fall into the hands of German troops. (4) France and the French fleet will be under German influence. (5) Germany can occupy a large amount of land in North Africa. (6) Controlling the Mediterranean is the key to Germany's future victory.

### Residents Evacuated from Various Locations in the Near East; Cairo to Be Declared a Fortified City; Prime Minister Nahas Requests British Troops to Withdraw from the City; British 9th and 10th Armies Rush to Reinforce Egypt

Havas News Agency telegram from the capital of Switzerland, 27th: The "Journal de Genève" reports that Cairo may be declared a non-defended city. Egyptian Prime Minister Nahas has requested General Stone, commander-in-chief of the British forces, to withdraw his troops from Cairo if the German-Italian allied forces continue to advance. According to "Swiss Newspaper," the evacuation of residents from the major cities of the Egyptian Nile Delta has begun. At the same time, news from the Bulgarian capital confirms that the Egyptian government has indeed made this decision. Furthermore, news from Alexandria states that the port authorities have begun distributing evacuation permits, and the railway authorities have prepared everything to transport civilians and their property to safe areas. Those who are responsible and cannot evacuate will live in the suburbs and take public transport to the city every day for work.

Havas News Agency telegram from Berlin, 27th: It is reported that the British military authorities in the Middle East, in view of the increasingly urgent threat to Egypt and the Near East from the Axis powers, are stepping up the evacuation of residents from the coastal cities of Syria, Palestine, and Egypt. According to reliable sources in Syria, the British 9th and 10th Armies stationed in the Near East have rushed to reinforce Egypt. According to German military experts, although these units have new equipment, they are suitable for garrison duty. It is doubtful how their combat effectiveness will be if they are to be deployed on the battlefield. The 8th Army is the elite of the British army and has been defeated by the German army, let alone others. In short, the Battle of Mersa Matruh is about to begin, and the strength of this British army will be known. This battle will undoubtedly determine the fate of Egypt. As far as the current situation is concerned, General Rommel's troops have been fighting for several weeks, and the supply line has been extended. On the British side, General Auchinleck's transportation line has been shortened, and fresh troops and better-equipped units can be sent to the front line. Since the German troops have arrived under the city of Mersa Matruh, it is unknown how much reserve strength the British have and whether their number is above the German-Italian allied forces. In any case, the British clearly intend to engage in a decisive battle in the Mersa Matruh area. If so, General Rommel will surely have the advantage, as evidenced by past battles.

German Troops Attack Matruh in Three Routes

Haitong News Agency telegram from Stockholm, Sweden, 28th: According to news from Cairo, General Rommel's armored units have reached a place fifteen miles west of Mersa Matruh, only 275 kilometers from Alexandria. German troops are attacking Mersa Matruh in three routes: the first route is advancing along the coastal highway, the second route is attacking along the railway from Tobruk to Mersa Matruh, and the third route is advancing from the south, only forty miles from Mersa Matruh. The British side admits that the Axis forces are pursuing the British forces day and night, but the British forces are avoiding engagement.

Haitong News Agency telegram from Stockholm, Sweden, 28th: The German High Command announced that the British public was shocked after German troops reached the west and northwest of Mersa Matruh. British semi-official sources believe that the German-Italian allied forces will not easily advance because the British have blown up the roads. According to the "Daily Intelligence" military reporter, Mersa Matruh is an important stronghold for the British forces in Egypt. If the city falls, the British forces will have to retreat to Alexandria. If the British army does not receive reinforcements of artillery and tanks, General Rommel's advance cannot be stopped. If the British 8th Army is defeated again, retreating to Alexandria is inevitable because there are no other defenses between Mersa Matruh and Alexandria.

Allied News Agency telegram from Lisbon, 28th: The brief lull on the Egyptian front was broken yesterday afternoon by two major engagements. The great battle of Egypt is thus launched. According to news from Cairo, German General Rommel's mechanized units, which crossed the British positions west of Mersa Matruh, have encountered the British army south of the city. Further west, there has also been contact between the Axis forces and the British forces. The goal of the Axis forces' attack is now to capture Mersa Matruh. As for the results of these initial contacts, the Cairo dispatch did not disclose them.

Havas News Agency telegram from a certain location on the Libyan border, 27th: According to news from the Egyptian front, the main forces of the British and German armies have not yet made contact. Rommel's troops are still seventeen miles away from the British positions in the Mersa Matruh area. It is reported that the German High Command has ordered the German troops to slow their advance in order to calmly prepare for the future great battle. At present, the German troops are concentrating along the coast, appearing to be launching a large-scale offensive on the coast. It is most likely that General Rommel intends to move south to trap the positions held by the 8th Army, so this should not be ignored, as this would allow the German troops to continue advancing towards Alexandria. In short, the eve of the outbreak of the great battle has arrived. The positions occupied by Rommel's troops are as follows: (1) The 21st German Mechanized Division is concentrated in the so-called "Tel el-Eisa depression"; (2) The 15th German Armored Division is deployed along the railway line; (3) The 20th German Light Division is advancing along the coastal highway. In addition, the facilities of Tobruk Port and the Ballani airfield have been quickly repaired after being destroyed by British troops. The British High Command is very concerned about this. With the assistance of U.S. aircraft, the British Air Force is sparing no expense to prevent Axis reinforcements from arriving in North Africa. The airfields of Crete have also been bombed by British aircraft. In the "Battle of Egypt," the British are aware of the importance of air power.

Havas News Agency telegram from Berlin, 27th: The German fleet in the Mediterranean is actively assisting in the operations on the Egyptian coast, with the main goal of preventing the British 8th Army from receiving supplies and reinforcements on the Egyptian front. Furthermore, German torpedo boats are operating near Tobruk Port, resulting in the sinking of six British patrol boats and one 4,500-ton ship.

### Two U.S. Commanders Killed in Action in North Africa

### Speech by South African Prime Minister

Haitong News Agency telegram from Stockholm, Sweden, 28th: According to news from Johannesburg, South African Prime Minister Smuts appealed to the South African people in a radio broadcast yesterday to actively enlist in the military to replenish the losses suffered by the South African troops during the fall of Tobruk. The Prime Minister called on his listeners to complete the unfinished work of the South African troops in Libya. Although the battle of Libya is over, the South African troops have not collapsed. Therefore, although the South African troops have suffered losses, the plan to establish a South African division will still be realized as much as possible.

Havas News Agency telegram from Sydney, 27th: Former Australian Prime Minister Hughes declared today that "the importance of the Atlantic war surpasses all other wars because if Britain cannot obtain fuel supplies, its air force will be rendered useless, thus making it impossible to protect shipping and bomb Germany.

### Over 600 American Nationals Evacuated This Morning Aboard the Conte Verde; British Nationals to Evacuate to East Africa Next Month

The Times reports that 130 British, American, and White Russian nationals and officials arriving in Shanghai from Manila last week have arrived on Friday. It is reported that there are 36 British officials stationed in the Philippines and 26 Shanghai Municipal Council employees among them. The majority of these 130 people came to Shanghai with the intention of returning to their home countries by ship, and most of them will return to their home countries tomorrow morning (29th) aboard the Conte Verde for evacuation.

British National Evacuation Ship to Depart Next Month

Yesterday, a senior Japanese official revealed that this first batch of Americans will be evacuated from Shanghai aboard the Conte Verde, while the British will be evacuated aboard the Felstore Macru, sometime between July 20th and 30th. The exact date has not yet been completely determined. It is understood that some of those who arrived in Shanghai from the Philippines on Friday last week were originally residents of Shanghai who had temporarily resided in the Philippines for a short period before the outbreak of the Pacific War. At the same time, it is rumored that the second batch of American evacuation matters is also currently under consideration by the Swiss Consulate in the area, but this news has not been officially confirmed.

Conte Verde Departs for East Africa This Morning

According to Masaki, the chief translator of the Japanese Consulate, 636 American officials and civilians gathering for evacuation assembled at the New Customs Wharf at 6:00 AM this morning. The reason for the slight delay of this Italian mail ship a few days ago was to adjust the roster of the evacuating nationals. The Conte Verde is about to sail to Magas, East Africa. In order to avoid confusion and unnecessary delays, heavy luggage has already been loaded onto the ship in advance, and each evacuee is only allowed to carry three light travel bags. Twenty-two buses have also been dispatched to transport the evacuating Americans from four locations: the Columbia Country Club, the Cathay Building, the American School, and the International Hotel, to the New Customs Wharf to board the ship.

Hoping the Nationals Obey Orders

On this evacuation ship, the Japanese and Swiss Consulates have distributed ribbons to each national, stipulating that officials wear red ribbons and civilians wear white ribbons. Officials from the Japanese Consulate and those responsible for the American Nationals Association will go to the New Customs Wharf to provide guidance when departure begins. Masaki also earnestly stated that to avoid unnecessary delays and confusion, the nationals should obey orders.

### Exemption of House Tax and Household Registration: Rice Rationing Measures

The first step before the implementation of rice rationing based on household registration in the Concessions, issuing rice purchase certificates, began on the 22nd. The method for receiving the certificates is in groups every two days, and will continue until July 4th, except for yesterday's suspension of issuance due to Sunday. After the rice purchase certificates have been issued, each sub-office will, within one week from the 6th to the 13th, handle matters related to those who have not yet received rice purchase certificates, such as stating reasons and applying for reissuance. Starting the second week, preparations will be made for issuing rice purchase certificates for August. As for the issuance of rice purchase certificates in the International Settlement, although only the house tax receipt needs to be presented, temples, shantytowns, and some schools, which have always been tax-exempt, have no way to present tax receipts. The Rice and Grain Management Committee has decided on a workaround for this situation so that they can also obtain rice purchase certificates and receive household rice. The date for these households to receive rice purchase certificates is generally expected to be handled within one week from the 6th to the 13th of this month. In the French Concession, those who have already obtained rice tickets could purchase household rice from designated rice shops yesterday.

### Opposing Rent Increase: Taking Advantage for Fraud

The houses in Dun Hou Li, Julai Da Road, French Concession, are managed by the Nanjing Commercial Bank. In August, all tenants were notified that their rents would be increased by 30%. At that time, Chen Zhaogui, the owner of Chen Gui Ji Fruit Store, No. 197 along the road, initiated and convened a meeting of all tenants to discuss opposing the rent increase. Chen had ulterior motives and falsely claimed to the tenants that each family should pay four months' rent in order to negotiate with the landlord. The tenants believed him and paid the money in full, totaling a huge sum of 3,000 yuan, for which Chen issued receipts. However, after Chen collected the money, he did not negotiate with the landlord and embezzled the funds. The landlord continued to urge the tenants to increase the rent, so the tenants inquired with Chen, but Chen turned his back and made disrespectful remarks, stating that the money had already been spent and asking what they could do about it. At this point, the tenants could not help but feel angry and accused Chen of intentionally defrauding them. Liu Wangshi and Hong Xinxiang jointly reported to the French authorities, accusing Chen of fraud and embezzlement, and stated that they wanted to resolve the issue with the landlord earlier, but were delayed by Chen's fraud, and the landlord has already sued them, all due to Chen's actions. They requested a thorough investigation. The authorities, based on their statements, ordered the summons of the defendant, but Chen Zhaogui avoided appearing in court and was instructed to be summoned again on another date for questioning.

### Silver and Money Industry: Referencing Market to Increase Interest Rates; Money Industry Association Agrees on Daily Rate of Two Jiao for Deposit and Loan Interest Rate

At the same time, the Bank Joint Reserve Association decided to increase the interest rate for interbank loans among members to 2 jiao per day from July 1st. It is also heard that each bank and shop will seriously handle loan business in the future to avoid fueling speculation. Mortgage loans for daily necessities and those related to people's livelihood will be rejected. Credit loans will adopt a guarantee system and be limited to domestic industrial and commercial enterprises and sales firms.

### Guangdong Repatriation Committee: Third Batch Repatriated to Hometown

The Guangdong Shanghai Fellow Association Repatriation Committee handled the repatriation of the second batch of fellow villagers to their hometowns, along with stranded sailors, totaling 157 people. They were transported yesterday by the Dongya Shipping Company's Toushan Maru, setting sail at 8:00 AM. At that time, there was a light drizzle and the order was orderly. However, this repatriation was limited by the ship's capacity, and fellow villagers from Shantou who had registered with the association for more than two months happened to meet the quota, so they were given priority for repatriation. As for fellow villagers returning to Guangzhou, they will be sent out around the beginning of next month. It is heard that the association has telegraphed the local authorities and charitable organizations in Shantou, requesting them to take care of them upon arrival.

### Workers' Technical Training Night School: Promoting Industrial Education (Continued from the 26th)

Theory and Practice Go Hand in Hand Without Contradiction

This school, in view of the fact that Chinese education is often too far removed from theory and practice, and that graduates of ordinary schools have more theoretical knowledge but very little practical experience, believes that to become a specialized technical talent, special training is necessary. Ordinary factory technicians and apprentices rely on sight and hearing to explore practical experience, but they only know what happens and not why. The school's teaching methods, therefore, use enlightening students' theoretical knowledge as the guiding principle. Therefore, its characteristics are: (1) not enrolling students without factory experience, (2) not teaching basic knowledge that can be obtained in factories, and (3) not teaching overly profound theories or cultural knowledge unrelated to work. The hired teachers, such as Hu Yunsheng, Jin Zhixuan, Zhang Zihui, Wu Chao, Mo Chengzhang, Cao Fengshan, Fu Haiqiu, Shen Baochang, Shen Jichao, and Huang Hongxi, are all knowledgeable and experienced engineers or university professors. The courses taught are all self-compiled lecture notes, and sometimes slides are shown to aid in the explanation.

Applying Knowledge to Practice, Studying Hard

The teaching materials are tailored to the needs of the students. What is learned today can be used tomorrow. Therefore, the students' interest is extremely strong. They are mostly young people in their twenties. If there is no proper way to use their spare time, they are prone to moral decline. Now, studying in their spare time is not only beneficial to their own future development, but also makes a great contribution to the country. Moreover, China's industry is backward and construction is immature, and specialized technical personnel are needed to promote the development of light and heavy industries. Three students work at the Pudong Yuanzhong Tobacco Company. Every night, they cross the river to study at the East One School on Jingzhou Road. After class, it is late, and they cannot catch a ride back, so they rent a house nearby and lodge there, and then rush across the river the next morning to go to work, making it a habit. Another student living in the eastern district is in the second grade. Because this grade does not have classes at the East School, he rides his bicycle to the West School on Gordon Road every night to attend class. The journey is arduous, but he does not think it is bitter. His spirit of learning is deeply admirable.

Expanding Organization, Establishing Electrical Engineering Class

In order to meet the needs of various sectors, the school plans to expand its organization next semester. In addition to the original mechanical engineering department, which plans to enroll 160 new freshmen and 50 transfer students in the second and third grades, it will add an electrical engineering class, enrolling 80 new freshmen. Any adult factory apprentices or technicians with three or four years of experience and an elementary school diploma may take the entrance exam. After three years of specialized training at the school, the Municipal Council will issue a diploma certifying them as strictly trained specialized technicians. Those with less than an elementary school education should first enter the Municipal Council's vocational supplementary night school for two or three years of study, and then take the exam to enter the Workers' Technical Training Night School. It is hoped that factory authorities will encourage workers to use their evenings for self-study. It is hoped that workers will hurry to receive industrial technical training, which can not only enrich their knowledge and experience, but also improve their position and income.

### Tianjin Distillery Establishes Distribution Office

The Tianjin Distillery in this city was founded by industry giants. The main factory is located on Xihua Road, Yangshupu. More than a dozen famous winemakers have been specially hired from Tianjin to be responsible for brewing. The products are trademarked with Golden Bell and Sorghum brands, and several kinds of pure dry wine, sorghum wine, Wujiapi wine, and rose wine have been produced. The quality of the wine is extremely fragrant and mellow, even better than those brewed in Tianjin. Recently, a distribution office has been established at No. 3 Baliqiao Street, Aiduya Road. During the opening period, special discounts are offered. All distribution points in the city are also selling at special prices at the same time.

### Chongde Lecture Series: Second Lecture

The Chongde Lecture Series, initiated by the elders of this city, will be held on schedule every Monday afternoon at 5:00 PM. Mr. Fu Bao, Yao Minghui, Yang Jianxing, Sun Xiangzhong, Yang Zhenru, Liu Qizhang, and Zhang Chunhua will take turns lecturing. The third lecture will be held on June 29th at No. 2 Houzaili, Baike Road, inside the Chongde Society. All sectors are welcome to attend, free of charge.

### You Pengxi Opens Clinics

Dr. You Pengxi, a medical doctor with a doctorate from the University of Halle, Germany, will be practicing at his residence at No. 15, Alley 21, West End, Jin Shenfu Road, West Aisi Road, from 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM every day starting July 1st. The original clinic at No. 18 Beihe Road, West End, Shanjiayuan, Baike Road, will still be open for practice from 3:00 PM to 5:00 PM.

Economic Supplement No. 420

Weekly Market Commentary

### The Prospects for the City's Economy After the Crackdown on Speculation

The market has been turbulent in recent years, and speculation is responsible for a considerable part of it; no one can deny this. Similarly, the distorted prosperity of this city's economy in recent years lies in the development of speculative activities, is also an undeniable fact, right? Although this is like drinking poison to quench thirst, if there is another way to go, the crackdown on speculative activities is not enough to affect the maintenance of the social economy; it can be asserted that if, after suppressing speculation, no new ways to earn a living are opened up for the industrial and commercial sectors, then the prospects for the economy seem to be not negligible?

Ideals should always be based on facts: In recent years, the fear of unemployment has been alleviated by speculation, accounting for perhaps 100% of the effect? If the stagnation of freight transportation and the industrial and commercial industry did not have a speculative market as a background, then perhaps 70% or 80% would be in a state of shop closure and business suspension? If the portion of salary income that cannot cover living expenses does not have speculative side income, there is really no difference in degree from a life of complete unemployment. So-called unemployment is not just the absence of a fixed occupation. These manufacturers who are opening and closing shops, these employees whose salary income is not enough to maintain their lives, are the mainstay of the unemployment ranks. Shanghai is actually completely immersed in the fear of unemployment. If dispersing the population targets dispersing the unemployed, then perhaps there will be no Shanghai anymore? If this view is not wrong, then the result of cracking down on speculation is to aggravate the fear of unemployment. Speculative activities should be cracked down on, and there is nothing to regret, without a doubt. But can the problem be simplified like this?

Those hot money that regarded Shanghai as a paradise have probably learned a painful lesson in the past week? If they think of this publication's past advice, should they feel regret?

### Market Trends

Public Bonds

Regarding the bond market, this publication issued a warning in the previous issue: many who heeded this warning were likely spared from the bond market's downturn last week.

The most significant declines last week were in types B and C, each falling by a substantial four to five yuan compared to the previous week. Next were types A and D, which fluctuated by two yuan during the week but also experienced a four- to five-yuan difference compared to the previous week. Type E only fluctuated by one yuan, with a three- to four-yuan difference from the previous week. This shows that the continuous surge two weeks ago has now been followed by a corresponding correction over the past two weeks; this can be seen as a natural adjustment in market prices.

Rumors of overall control have caused widespread anxiety in the speculative market. However, securities trading is fundamentally different from other types of transactions. While theoretical arguments against it may be valid, there remains room for discussion regarding practical considerations. The issue of "chips" (market participation) raised in the previous issue remains important. The emergence of a stable situation indicates a level playing field is in sight.

Chinese Stocks: The sentiment in the Chinese stock market remains in a state of stability. This is rare and commendable at a time when various markets are suffering from nervous breakdowns, but it is also due to its unique characteristics.

Chinese Stocks

Chinese stocks represent the securitization of industrial capital, and indeed the capitalization of real resources. Holding them is like holding paper, but it represents tangible assets; it shares a form with public bonds but differs in essence, and it differs in form from material goods but shares the same essence. However, the key lies in the degree of control over material resources.

Foreign Stocks: The foreign stock grey market has a poor climate, and the future is difficult to foresee.

Foreign Currency: Foreign currency is only available in the form of banknotes. Military scrip is only available through 183 money shops authorized by the military, and these money shops can only conduct transactions at the official rate. The official rate is 18 yuan of military scrip per 100 yuan of fiat currency. Therefore, the market rate for military scrip last week was between 5.50 yuan and 5.55 yuan.

Yarn and Cloth: Yarn and cloth are weak and declining. Weekend prices for "Phoenix" brand yarn returned to 5,400 yuan, from 5,200 yuan the previous week. "Dragon Head" brand yarn fell from 211 yuan to 176 yuan. Sixteen-pound "Globe" brand cloth was about 20 yuan cheaper than the previous week, and twelve-pound "Big Roc" also fell by about 20 yuan. There is currently no room for optimism.

New Wheat: There are reports of a 20-30% increase in the harvest of new wheat, which is beneficial for purchase prices. The purchase of Jiangbei wheat is centered in Taixian. Taidong is under the Jiangbei Company, and Taixi is under the China Branch Grain and Flour Joint Association. The lower-level purchasing organizations are uniformly managed by Mitsui, Mitsubishi, and Yoshida. It is estimated that this year's spring wheat production will be 4 million bags in Jiangnan and 2 million bags in Jiangbei.

Based on the barter system between North and Central China, the quota for flour transported from Central China to North China this year is 5.1 million bags. The first shipment of 1.5 million bags is scheduled to be loaded before August.

Beans: Bean transport permits cannot be obtained, and the market is quiet with little trading. In addition, rumors abound, and no one dares to get involved, so market prices are increasingly weak.

Grain: The market conditions for corn, bran, red sorghum, etc., are slow, and prices are fixed.

Oil Cakes: Agreed prices for various oil cakes remain unchanged, but the market situation in North China remains weak. The shipment of bean cakes is delayed, domestic sales are stagnant, and trading is scarce.

Sugar Market: The sugar market has long been selling at agreed prices, and prices remain stable at 71 yuan for refined white sugar and 66 yuan for Dutch red sugar. However, speculators are using the share certificates of the cooperative business office as trading chips. Although sugar prices remain unchanged, these share certificates fluctuate wildly, engaging in intense speculation. Last week, refined white sugar shares rose by 10 yuan from 304 yuan, and red sugar shares rose from 292 yuan to 300 yuan. However, by the weekend, prices had fallen back again.

Cigarettes: The cigarette market has suffered a major setback and continues to decline. Stockpilers are scrambling to unload their inventory to avoid risks. However, given the increasing number of moldy cigarettes being sold, rationing is anticipated; therefore, there are few buyers.

Firewood and Soap: Matches, candles, and soap are also in dire straits. Market sentiment is extremely depressed, partly due to the downturn in the cigarette market and partly due to the threat of price controls.

### A Plea for Orphans

— Mu

The Children's Protection Section of the Shanghai Municipal Council's Industrial Department, in order to find warm homes for homeless and orphaned children, specially invited people from all walks of life to watch MGM's film "A Mother's Heart" at the Grand Cathay Theatre on the 27th. This heartwarming film tells the story of a poor American widow who struggles to raise and adopt homeless orphans and illegitimate children, seeking joyful and warm homes for them as their final destination. She fearlessly overcomes social and environmental obstacles and difficulties, striving to eliminate the term "illegitimate children" from legal and birth certificates, establishing immortal achievements on the path of human civilization.

She said, "There are no illegitimate children, only illegitimate parents!" This outcry breaks through social traditions and prejudices, and this voice illuminates the future of unfortunate children.

In our country, due to the powerful traditional forces of the old society, orphans and illegitimate children are often still discriminated against. As long as a child is born and raised in a relatively poor family, he often cannot have a smooth path, he is often looked down upon and ignored by the world, and he cannot receive the same opportunities as others, even though he has the same abilities as others. Is poverty and misfortune a sin? Of course not! A thousand times no! But the facts we see are completely the opposite.

The Children's Protection Section of the Shanghai Municipal Council is seeking suitable families for more than 3,000 children housed in more than 30 charitable organizations in Shanghai. Their work is difficult, their responsibilities are significant, and what they are engaged in is a work that will never be finished under the current social system. What they are appealing to the public for this time is not financial donations, but spiritual assistance. What they need is the noblest and purest love and compassion. They need every caring person to help them find a good home, a sweet home, and a warm home for the orphaned children.

(The address of the Children's Protection Section of the Industrial and Social Affairs Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council is Room 605, 109 Jiangxi Road, telephone 15349. Anyone who can help them can contact them directly.)

### The Pain of Biting

— Ke Qi

To My Third Brother

Five years ago, we parted in the heavy silence of the military, which left me with a deep impression that time cannot erase. That day, the day we parted, our meeting was like the confluence of the Jialing River and the Yangtze River in winter and spring—meeting but not merging. From the shore, you can see the two rivers merging, but one is muddy yellow, and the other is emerald green. I thought we would no longer have the opportunity to talk, but unexpectedly, today Weiguang brought me your news and mailing address, saying that you have been living under the biting of bookworms and poisonous snakes, unable to get rid of the constraints in your heart, and suffering. This information prompted me to restore the friendship and brotherly feelings that we have always had. I want to send a few words from this distant hometown, hoping they will please you.

For five days, I haven't received any news from you. Although it hasn't disturbed me much, I have been thinking of you. You are young and intelligent. Because of this, you have the ability to appreciate everything, and in front of people, you seem to look down on everything. However, you have overlooked that you cannot yet independently use everything. Perhaps in the process of trying, you occasionally achieve success, which not only cannot accelerate your progress but will instead place an obstacle in your path. You are arrogant and suffer from nearsightedness. At the same time, your views on things are relatively detached from reality. This is what I have always told you. Have you ever thought that these might be the main reasons why you are suffering?

I remember one evening in middle school, when you and I were walking on the tennis court, you dropped a sentence before returning to the dormitory that made me think for several starless nights. You said in imitation of Rudin's tone: "I sowed seeds, but I don't see the results. I lack something, but I can't say what I lack... I must lack something." What do you lack? At the time, I didn't give you an answer because I couldn't answer. Now I think you don't lack the passion, courage, or perseverance that Rudin lacked. It seems that you have a lot of these in your clever brain. What you lack is a correct observation of things, and such a lack is more serious than Rudin's lack.

You often make some plans for yourself without sufficient basis (also known as nearsightedness) and live all day in unrealizable hopes (which is a waste). You overestimate yourself but ignore the opinions of experienced people. In this way, you wait day after day. What kind of response have you received today? The pain of biting!

Do you feel bitten? Compared to the pain of biting, it is better. The suffocation of boredom is what really requires patience. For you, to fundamentally solve the problem, I hope you will once again make a strict self-criticism, dig out the evil roots of your personality—eliminate arrogance, learn from all aspects, and in dealing with life and career, start from the distant perspective and practical approach.

I cherish your intelligence and ability, and I care about your physical and mental health. I write these sentences with the most sincere friendship, hoping to give you a little comfort and help. We are all young. Why are we being eroded by bookworms all day long?

### The Uncrowned King

— 

1.  Self-Analysis

People who flatter newspaper reporters say that their pen is equal to three thousand Mausers, wielding the power of life and death and possessing supreme authority. Therefore, they are given the honorable title of "Uncrowned King." Even now, people who do not clearly understand the situation of newspaper reporters still express some goodwill and the utmost respect, and even have some envious feelings.

In reality, newspaper reporters are also people, very ordinary people. The reason why they are valued by people is simply because they have a pen that can express power. Therefore, newspaper reporters are not respected for themselves, but because they can express power that can attract public attention. Just look at how many retired senior gentlemen, when they were in office, were so glorious, with piles of letters on their desks, each opened, full of excessively flattering words, and after reading them, they were almost all the same, all saying "Please publish..." or "Deem it unworthy to publish." Disputes and difficulties arise due to "publish" and "not publish." However, it is very surprising that these senior gentlemen, once they put down their pens and left, are no longer respected or praised. Are they forgotten? Or have they lost their effectiveness?

Take Shanghai as an example. Apart from people who read newspapers for the sake of reading newspapers, the rest who are willing to interact with newspaper reporters have only two reasons. One is "liaison." What is meant by "liaison" is not that they are afraid of what the newspaper reporters will do, but that they are afraid that something will happen to themselves, or that it will not look good if it is reported in the newspaper. Therefore, they "give a little benefit in normal times to facilitate liaison," which also contains a "prevention" effect. The other is "utilization." People with this core reason hope that the newspaper reporters will always praise them, for example, publish their name at meetings and remove their name when they are sued.

People with these two kinds of mentality are certainly undesirable, but if the newspaper reporter himself sets his own principles, keeps himself clean, and minds his own business, he can avoid being contacted and not be utilized. What is most distressing is that the profession of newspaper reporter is inherently a troublemaking business. It is said that "eating your own food and minding other people's business" is like this. If you don't look for trouble, people will come looking for you. You can't please the east, and the west complains. After all, the pen is not a gun. What three thousand Mausers? I am afraid that it is not even as good as one Mauser. The "Uncrowned King" is on the path of going from high to decline.

Therefore, when you first become a newspaper reporter, you are very enthusiastic. As long as your stomach is healthy, you can attend three or four banquets every night, or watch free dramas two or three times a week. At this time, you can taste the pleasure of being praised by people. But as time goes by, you will feel a little bored. After two or three years, you may feel bored. After eight or ten years, you will recognize that being a newspaper reporter is just this. It is not until you have been grinding for ten or twenty years that you recognize yourself as small and pathetic, manufacturing sins every night, and getting further and further away from the ideal situation.

Human Affairs

### On the Australian Aborigines (Part II)

— Da Ke

The Australian aborigines usually have a chief, sometimes two (one old and one young). If there is no chief, then all disputes in the tribe are decided by the elders. If there is a dispute that cannot be resolved, the outcome of the fight is used as the standard for right and wrong. Often as many as two or three hundred people participate in the fight. The causes of disputes rarely involve theft, because they value other people's property quite a bit. Most of the disputes arise from the theft of women.

However, they also have the concept of family. Their way of getting married is the most modern group marriage. If a certain tribe is divided into two parties, then every man in party A has the right to marry every woman in party B, and vice versa. However, this is only a hypothetical law. If a man and woman in the two parties love each other, then the elders in the tribe will act as matchmakers to make their good deeds come true. However, sometimes a man steals a woman and declares that he is taking her as his wife. Of course, if this is a married woman, then her husband will inevitably have a conflict with the man who stole the woman, and may even cause a dispute between the two tribes. Sometimes, the elders in the tribe allocate a woman to several men, then the older men can enjoy priority.

Boys in the tribe, at about the age of fourteen, hold a ceremony to impart secrets. An old man climbs up a tree, holding a wooden board tied with human hair in his hand. The sacred wooden board, as it rotates, emits a sharp sound, and women and children hurriedly avoid it, otherwise they will be in danger of being executed. At this time, the boys are all dressed up, each accompanied by their godfather. The godfather first gives the child his own blood to drink, then orders the child to crawl on the ground, and then cuts many knife marks on his neck and waist, and pours his own blood into these wounds. If the child calmly endures this ceremony without showing any signs of pain, he will be publicly recognized as an adult. Then he learns the secrets of the warriors, and at the same time obtains a stone wrapped in hair as the warrior's amulet, which must never be shown to women.

Women are treated better when they are young, but once they get old, they are abused by their husbands, and can even be killed by their husbands without anyone intervening. Old men often possess the youngest and most beautiful women in the tribe, while young men can only have an old woman at most. However, wealthy or brave and skilled young men can also steal a few other women to fill the ranks of concubines. However, sometimes old women can also serve as judges, and in the middle of war, they also bear the responsibility of protecting prisoners, otherwise all prisoners will be executed.

Australian women are not very good at producing children. Although they do not often abuse children, infanticide is not uncommon. There are even a few gluttonous mothers who even eat their own children.

There are many kinds of funeral ceremonies for the Australian aborigines. Sometimes the dead person's legs are tied tightly together—it is said that this way, the dead person's ghost cannot come to the human world to cause trouble—the dead person's mouth is stuffed with pieces of wood, and then the whole body is wrapped in bark and buried in a pit in the middle of the earth. If there is a large tree nearby that has been hollowed out by insects, then the dead person is placed in the tree, and then the tree is set on fire and burned, becoming a kind of cremation. Sometimes, the corpses are smoked into dry mummies in the fire and then preserved. If the deceased was a warrior who had experienced many battles, then his skin would be carefully peeled off by experts, and his flesh would of course be eaten by people, but his bones would be washed clean and placed in his skin for everyone to see.

If a young child dies, his mother wraps the dead child in bark and places it beside her until the child turns into bones before burying it. In the southern region, believe it or not, the family of the deceased even cuts off the head of the deceased and uses it as a drinking vessel.

Of course, we cannot believe that the Australian aborigines are completely primitive people. They also have a considerable degree of civilization, for example, they know how to weave baskets and other things. However, they live in remote areas and have little contact with the outside world, so their progress is much slower than that of other peoples. Their daily life and customs still preserve a part of the legacy of our ancestors.

### Concentration

— Ye

The secret to concentration is to be interested in the work you are doing.

If possible, the profession you choose should be one that you are interested in. This makes it very easy for you to concentrate on it.

### Sharing the Same Boat in Storms

— He Jia Zhi

(6) A Snap of the Fingers

Wei Cheng told Second Mrs. Ye and Cui Zhen about his beliefs. Mrs. Ye said, "Time really flies. How come it's summer vacation so quickly?" Cui Zhen said, "I often think that going to Shanghai is like something that happened yesterday, but it's actually been many days. Brother Cheng, Miss Chen wrote a letter asking you to go to Shuangqiao. Are you going or not?" Wei Cheng said, "Now, Sister Cui Zhen and them are more enthusiastic than I am. Because Sister Cui Zhen has been to their home in Shanghai, but I haven't. When they come back, Sister Cui Zhen and I will go to Shuangqiao together." Wei Cheng asked for Cui Zhen's consent in advance. Cui Zhen looked at Second Mrs. Ye and smiled, "I'm not going. The fields are busy. They will be busy until July before they can be free. Cows eat straw, ducks eat grain, it's everyone's fortune. I can't compare to Miss Chen." Second Mrs. Ye said, "That doesn't matter. Cui Zhen, if you want to go, you can go with your brother Cheng. Anyway, let the hired workers work a little harder in the fields."

After saying this, suddenly it was the beginning of June in the lunar calendar. This year, it didn't rain much during the plum rain season. Once it was June, it was so hot that it was unbearable. Wei Cheng was at home, wearing only an upturned collar shirt on his upper body and sports pants that were short to the thighs on his lower body, still waving his palm-leaf fan and complaining about the heat. But in front of Second Mrs. Ye and Cui Zhen, he usually didn't dare to complain about the heat. He was thinking, "I'm sitting at home complaining about the heat, what about them working in the fields?" One evening, the sun had passed, and rattan chairs, round stools, square stools, and reclining chairs were scattered in the courtyard. Wei Cheng, Second Mrs. Ye, and Cui Zhen were sitting casually. Wei Cheng looked at the sky and smiled, "Unknowingly, today is the fifth day of June." Second Mrs. Ye said, "You said that you would go to Shuangqiao in early June. Are you going or not?
