The southwest of the city is the most dangerous. The German army, with 200 tanks and 150,000 troops, echoed the dive bombers that covered the sky, and carried out a tragic encirclement along the entire line from Stalingrad south to the Volga River. In addition, the Soviet troops in the northwestern war zone of the city are currently carrying out desperate counterattacks to prevent the German advance.

Berlin, 4th (Haitong News Agency dispatch) - Military authorities revealed that the battle of Stalingrad has entered its final stage from the most intense stage. Stalingrad's guards have been assisting in the battle and are doing their best to defend the city.

German Führer Headquarters, 4th (Haitong News Agency dispatch) - Today's German war report stated that on September 1, the German and Romanian allied forces, with the assistance of the navy and air force, crossed the Kerch Strait, defeated the enemy's strong resistance, broke through their coastal defense line, and quickly advanced.

### Soviet Troops Retreat to New Front Lines in Several Areas of Stalingrad

Ensk, 4th (Havas News Agency dispatch) - The General Headquarters announced this morning that the Red Army continued to retreat in the southwest of Stalingrad and the northwest of Novorossiysk yesterday.

Sweden Jingcheng, 4th (Domei News Agency dispatch) - The Soviet front lines northwest and southwest of Stalingrad were attacked by 25 divisions of the German army and hundreds of tanks, and were defeated. Soviet troops in several areas are retreating to new front lines. The Soviet Red Star newspaper reported that the intensity of the fighting northwest and southwest of the city, and the large number of soldiers and weapons deployed by both sides, were unprecedented in Soviet battles. Soviet sources admitted that the German forces north of the city were strong, and the number of German troops in several areas in that direction had increased by two or three times yesterday. German troops in several areas in the northwest have broken through the outer defense line of the Soviet army and are currently engaged in fierce fighting. German planes have repeatedly carried out dive bombing attacks over the city of Stalingrad, and Soviet fighter planes have intercepted them, resulting in continuous air battles. The Soviet communique admitted that German tanks and infantry south of the city of Stalingrad had made advances, and Soviet troops in another area were also forced to withdraw to new front lines. The communique also revealed that Soviet troops continued to maintain a defensive posture in the battle of Novorossiysk. German tank troops and motorized infantry, after heavy bombardment by aircraft and artillery, broke into the Soviet positions. It is also reported that German troops have re-entered the Grozny oil fields, but the details are unknown.

Sweden Jingcheng, 4th (Havas News Agency dispatch) - The emergency situation of the German army's general attack on the inner defense line of Stalingrad is increasing. The fighting in the north and west of the city is also very fierce. The Soviet troops are retreating step by step and have to concentrate in a narrower area. According to a Soviet communique, the losses suffered by the German mechanized units have yet to be fully accounted for. It is only known that in one war zone, only six of the 38 German tanks were destroyed. In another area, 11 of the 20 German tanks were overrun. At this point, the number of places where the German army has broken through the inner defense line of Stalingrad is too numerous to count. Military experts today generally believe that the hope of the Soviet troops saving Stalingrad is becoming increasingly slim. Although the defending troops have launched counterattacks in several places, they have been unable to turn the tide. The German side admits that the enemy's resistance is strong and the fighting is brave, but expects that the fall of Stalingrad is only a matter of time. However, they do not believe that the defending troops will surrender suddenly, as there is a precedent of Odessa and Sevastopol. The German offensive in the south of the city has intensified in the past 48 hours, and has captured a mountain after fierce fighting. The mountain is enough to overlook the town of Krasnaya Sloboda. As for the west and north of the city, the Soviet troops' resistance is more effective. As for the other two objectives of the German army, one is the Black Sea port of Novorossiysk, and the other is Grozny in the Caucasus. On the Black Sea front, the German offensive has been hindered by heavy rain and terrain. The Soviet side intends to resupply Novorossiysk by sea, and seems to intend to hold it for a long time. However, whether reinforcements can arrive in time is questionable. On the Grozny front, German infantry and tanks have crossed the Terek River, and the oil area is under direct threat.

### News from the Northwest of Novorossiysk

Moscow, 3rd (Havas Agency) – The Soviet High Command has issued a war report stating that in the past twenty-four hours, our forces engaged in combat with German troops northwest and southwest of Stalingrad, and northwest of the port of Novorossiysk. There have been no significant changes in other regions.

Ukrainian Border, (Havas Agency) – The most significant development in the former region yesterday was the German advance towards the vicinity of Novorossiysk. The city of Shapshugskaya, only ten miles from the port, has already been occupied by German and Romanian forces. Moscow issued a communiqué for the first time this morning mentioning the fighting northeast of Novorossiysk. German aircraft are continuously bombing the port, and it is expected that a large-scale retreat is currently underway in the area. It appears that there are currently three Soviet divisions in the port of Novorossiysk. The situation on other fronts in the Caucasus is relatively stable. The positions of both German and Soviet forces remain unchanged. Soviet defenses appear to be stronger than before. According to German military experts, there is no unified front in the small Caucasus region, and each army is currently operating independently.

Berlin, 4th (DNB Agency) – An official announcement stated that German troops who landed on the Taman Peninsula in the Pokrovsky Strait on September 1st have today made contact with Romanian troops advancing from the east. Soviet forces cut off on the Taman Peninsula continue to resist, but their military strength is not significant.

Somewhere on the Soviet Border, 3rd (Havas Agency) – Today is the 438th day of the German-Soviet war. The pressure on Stalingrad remains as before. German and allied forces are attacking from the north, south, and west, with the front lines about fifteen to twenty-five miles from the city. The Soviet forces west and southwest of the city are in a very dangerous situation. German troops on the northern route have also reached the city of Dubrovka on the banks of the Volga River. However, German supply lines there are frequently attacked by Soviet forces, so the situation is not yet extremely critical. The Soviet side now also acknowledges that the situation in the city is critical, but Soviet resistance is extremely strong. General Timoshenko's counter-offensive in the Kletskaya region continues to keep the German High Command on edge. According to reports received in Berlin today, Stalin left Astrakhan yesterday aboard a gunboat and arrived in Stalingrad today to take command, demonstrating the Soviet determination to defend the city to the end. As for the former region of Rzhev, the Soviet offensive remains very strong. The Soviet side has mobilized a large number of tanks to assist in the battle, suffering heavy losses. However, to date, the Soviet forces have not achieved any significant gains. There have been no major changes on the Caucasus front. The pressure from German and Romanian forces on the port of Novorossiysk continues to increase. The Soviet position is critical. Although they are making every effort to use the terrain to stop the German forces, it is expected that the collapse of their resistance is only a matter of time. There is also fighting in the area of the Terek River in the southeast. It is reported that German troops have crossed the river in the Mozdok area. However, Moscow claims that German troops have not yet been able to establish a bridgehead in the south.

Currently, the authorities are conducting various studies, all strictly in accordance with the recently issued price control notice, and the actions of the Shanghai Municipal Council are being carried out in cooperation with the Japanese authorities. As it stands, only retailers are subject to control, so it is extremely important to make a more thorough adjustment of the prices of transactions between wholesalers and retailers, and to adjust the sales prices between wholesalers and retailers. Similarly, the sales prices between manufacturers and wholesalers must also be adjusted.

Consideration of Appropriate Rationing Plans

In order to effectively control manufacturers' sales prices, the authorities have now instructed them to submit detailed reports of manufacturing costs. They will also collect information on the costs of wholesalers. Finally, they will investigate the costs of retailers. The authorities will also study methods of rationing goods and considering appropriate rationing plans is also a necessary measure in order to discover shortages or inadequacies. For this reason, manufacturers, wholesalers, and retailers must each establish associations separately.

There are still several types of retail businesses that are not included in ordinary retailers and will be strictly controlled by the Shanghai Municipal Council to ensure that they maintain reasonable sales prices. The prices of all goods currently controlled by the Japanese authorities may be greatly reduced, and goods shipped to Shanghai from Japan and other places will only be allowed to obtain reasonable profits. Regarding the supply of goods from the interior to Shanghai, he believes that "cheap supply and cheap purchase" can smoothly transport products from the interior to Shanghai. At the same time, there should be greater freedom in the transportation and movement permits for goods.

Shop Prices Have All Fallen

The Datong News Agency reports that the overall economic situation of the city's people has improved as a result of the authorities' active adoption of strict price suppression measures. Major department stores have gradually marked the prices of goods they sell this month to conform to the price limits set by the authorities.

The shopkeepers of these stores all expect that in the near future, the authorities will put pressure on the scope of the goods they sell, so they are now eagerly getting rid of their stock, and have slightly reduced prices, so as not to be

### Jewelry Store Maid Conspires with Gang to Commit Theft

Hongxing Jewelry Store at No. 63 Avenue Joffre has been the victim of successive thefts of jewelry and precious stones worth more than 100,000 yuan from July until the middle of last month. The day before yesterday, a shop assistant saw the maid, Lin Wei (30 years old, Chaozhou native), opening the iron safe in the jewelry room on the second floor to commit theft. He immediately grabbed her and called the police, who took her to the police station. Under interrogation, Wei confessed that after successively stealing jewelry, she transferred it to her fellow villager, Huang Xu (37 years old, working as a domestic helper at No. 4, Lane 27, Avenue Joffre), and then entrusted Lin Deshun (36 years old, fellow villager, street sweeper in Guangdeli, Songshan Road) to sell it, sharing the profits. According to the confession, the police chief dispatched detectives to arrest Huang Xu and Lin Deshun one after another, recovering a portion of the stolen goods and detaining them pending investigation.

### Mr. Zhao De's Memorial Service Held Yesterday
### People from All Walks of Life Came to Express Condolences
### Staff of This Newspaper Held a Public Memorial Ceremony

Yesterday was the date of the memorial service for Mr. Zhao Dezai, the father of Zhao Youhao, a reporter for this newspaper. People from all walks of life came to express their condolences in an endless stream from morning till night. The details are as follows:

Mr. Dezai devoted his life to history and geography and the development of education, making contributions to society. His sudden death has caused grief in all circles. Those who went to offer condolences yesterday included elders Shen Enfu, Ding Fubao, Yuan Ludeng, Feng Bingnan, Jiang Weiqiao, Pang Diancai, and other leaders from all walks of life, totaling more than 1,000 people. Eulogies and scrolls were hung on all four walls, all deeply respecting Mr. Zhao's achievements.

At noon, the staff of this newspaper held a public memorial ceremony, presided over by Wang Ziqin, with Lu Yiming and Tang Shichang as assistant officiants. The Banjiang Children's Home first played sad music, presented flowers and wine, and solemnly read the eulogy. The ceremony was solemn and lasted for an hour. In the afternoon, people from all walks of life continued to offer condolences. The entire road on Kuling Road was filled with white horses and elaborate decorations, showing great respect.

### Thinking about the Value of Life from Mr. Zhao's Memorial Service

Life is originally a journey. Some devote themselves to academia, completing their journey of establishing a career. This is a meaningful and valuable life. Reading the eulogies and couplets from people of all walks of life at Mr. Zhao Dezai's memorial service in Shanghai yesterday, we deeply felt the value of life. Mr. Dezai devoted himself to education and the study of history and geography, and his filial piety and friendship were respected by scholars. He enjoyed a long life and completed his journey of devoting himself to academia. Now, we select excerpts from the condolences from all walks of life to show that although Mr. Zhao's image is gone, his virtue still remains:

Elderly man Shen Enfu (79 years old) couplet: Skilled in history and geography, accomplished in filial piety and kindness, this old man should enter the Confucian biography, worrying about the times when he was ill, and his soul returned to the land of happiness, knowing that he achieved Buddhahood through the Pure Land sect.

Chen Taoyi's eulogy: Living in the empty mountains, writing books to show his ambition, ascending to the land of happiness forever, abandoning his body in peace.

Hu Pu'an's eulogy: Alas, Mr. Zhao, lofty in his aspirations, pure in his body, versed in all the books, knowledgeable and virtuous, living in harmony, teaching his sons with righteousness, treating people with sincerity, but not reaching the age of hope, what is the reason for the heavens? The younger generation looks up to him, and the autumn water is born. Alas, since Mr. Zhao's death, who is the true Confucian?

Feng Bingnan's eulogy written by Qian Chongwei: Venus is dim, and Shao Wei star falls. A philosopher has passed away, and the sound of virtue is lacking. Only Mr. Zhao, in his prime, was famous in the school. Observing the times and judging changes, his eyes were like torches. Seeking practical knowledge, he devoted himself to mathematics and astronomy, and studied geography. He had a thousand years in his heart and recorded them in his writings. Studying the past to verify the present, he wrote a general history. Building a school in Guangling, he held grand lectures, cultivating future generations, with many talented students. He tried his best to serve his parents, cutting his own flesh to treat their illness, moving the gods with his sincerity. His filial piety was a model, his righteous ways taught his sons, and he passed on a clean family, bringing prosperity to his descendants, becoming the essence of the country. Strolling with a cane, he lived in seclusion in the fields, planting flowers and bamboos, searching for mountains and asking questions. Suddenly encountering chaos and hardship, he became ill with worry and abandoned the world. An elder achieved a good end, and his model did not fall. The thoughtful ones are virtuous, shedding tears in the wind.

Jiang Weiqiao's couplet: Skilled in the three fields of learning, using the original principles, nothing is better than history. Four phoenixes in front of the hall, virtuous generations have talented people.

Li Haoran's couplet: Indulging in reading historical records and geography, studying the past and the present. What is the difference between his far-sightedness and Gu Jingfan? Passing on the family is only accumulating learning, inheriting the methods of his predecessors, and future generations will not be ashamed of Hui Songyai.

Du He's couplet: Melting the classics and history, developing learning and nurturing talents, saving the world from chaos, he can be regarded as a pioneer. Filial piety and friendship, cautious in the small and upright in virtue, his pure fragrance will leave a legacy, blessing his descendants.

E Sheng's eulogy: In the past, Xiao Yan wrote a general history. When Jiangling was burned, both civil and military officials were saddened. For thousands of years, only the sound of Dongshui was respected. Mr. Zhao's foresight matched that of his predecessors. He roamed the past and the present, collecting records and weighing changes, uniquely marking new ideas. His son, bearing his father's teachings, reported on current affairs, holding a pen in Shanghai, independent and unyielding, accumulating knowledge and benefiting future generations, encouraging the present world. His high style will last forever.

All the staff of this newspaper couplet: The world has experienced disasters, and the land is full of chaos. Mr. Zhao used Buddhist principles to prove the three vehicles. Let us wait and see for the rosy clouds, and his soul will have a basis to transform. His son's fame is widely known. Heaven does not destroy his filial piety, leaving an old man. Waiting for the Pleiades to set and the moon to fall, his spirit is like a fragrance. If he returns,

### Spotlight on Hong Kong Football Stars (3)

Versatile Forward Zhuo Shijin

Zhuo Shijin is a versatile forward from Hong Kong, able to use both feet equally well and comfortable in any forward position, hence his reputation for versatility. He comes from the South China Athletic Association, known as the Hong Kong football academy. At the age of eighteen, he became famous on the football field. He was selected as one of the representatives of China's World Games team. At the age of only twenty-two, he was the youngest member of the team. Before the incident, he transferred to Hong Kong Guanghua, once leading the team to defeat the mighty South China team, especially impressing in the past.

Rising Star Zheng Yingquan

This gentleman comes from the military, and is physically strong. Hong Kong soldiers also fear him when playing football. The Hong Kong Engineering Corps once invited him to help out, and he then played for the Eastern Association. In 1931, Eastern won the Hong Kong-Guangzhou final, and he contributed to the victory. This year, at the age of twenty-seven, this treasure from Fuan, Fujian, is able to play any football position and is also versatile.

Jin Jiabiao Revisits Old Haunts

Jin was originally from Shanghai and once played for Donghua. He then went to the interior and then to Hong Kong for employment. Recently, he served as a central defender for Guanghua's Group A team. He has been studying to become a football referee in Hong Kong. This gentleman has a diploma, and now he is revisiting old haunts. He has been separated from Shanghai for three days and should be looked at with new eyes.

### Under the Coverage of Buying Sentiment, the Bond Market Becomes a Straight Line

Yesterday, the unified government bond market was thriving, the market sentiment was strong, and it was exceptionally stable. This was because various banks received a lot of cash, and people's hearts were refreshed. Because the number of chips was rare, it caused short covering, so the rising trend became stronger and stronger. The whole city was covered by buying sentiment, almost becoming a straight line up. Judging from the trend, with the actual receipts of new entrants and large holders, the potential of sellers in terms of chips is slightly inferior. Therefore, for the time being, the buyers are in a better position. In the morning, Hongda, Tongyuan, Shuntai, Qianyi, Xie Kang, etc. first bought in. Although Tongshun, Xin Kang, Lanxin, Runde, Tongyu, Lianhe, Hu Heji, etc. sold hard along the way, it was slightly softer for a while. However, later, due to the needs of Runli, Tongli, and retail investors, it was pulled up. As a result, except for Class A bonds which only rose 7 jiao, the other bonds rose about 1 yuan each. The turnover was about 3 million yuan. The table is listed below.

### Chinese Stocks at a Loss
### Except for Department Stores Which Have Turned Around
### Others are Exhausted as Before

Yesterday, the Chinese stock market was still falling sharply. Only the stocks of the three department stores, Wing On, Sincere, and China National Goods, have rebounded due to excessive declines recently and the activity of bargain hunters. The market has stabilized. Wing On rose 5 jiao, Sincere added 1 yuan, and China National Goods rose 1 yuan and 5 jiao. China Underwear has shown little improvement. Due to news of a fire at the factory this morning, it fell by a huge 1 yuan and 5 jiao. The new pharmaceutical industry was particularly depressed. New Asia plunged by 2 yuan. Sino-French broke through the 70 yuan mark, small 3 yuan and 5 jiao. Minyi fell 1 yuan to 60 yuan. In the cultural industry, only China Bookstore saw stability. The Commerce Press was at a small 7 yuan and 5 jiao. World Book Company was down 5 yuan. In the public utilities sector, Zhabei Water and Electricity was down a small 5 jiao, falling close to the 30 yuan mark. The Chinese market sentiment was stable. The Great China Match Company continued to decline by 2 yuan and 5 jiao. The Nanyang Tobacco Company was down 1 yuan. The new stocks also fell accordingly. Fu Chang Dyeing fell by a small 5 jiao. Great China Weaving and Shanghai Cotton Weaving returned to the previous day's price. As of today, people's hearts are still difficult to stabilize. The turnover was not lonely. The prices of each stock are recorded below.

### Woolen Fabrics and Guang Goods are Uniquely Popular

The trend of Guang goods and woolen fabrics has been quite popular recently. The supply of raw materials, wool, is cut off, and there is no doubt that the production of factories will inevitably decrease in the future. Therefore, those in the industry with inventory are mostly hoarding and not selling. Also, because the inventory is not large, the retail demand is not weak, and people's hearts are more optimistic. Yesterday, such as fine wool woven medium-thick flower呢, various patterned and plain western-style suit 花呢, ビジ海林棒, 宜維華達呢, 馬褲呢驼叫巾 and the like, were popular in the market, with brisk transactions. The prices are rising, and the demand and supply are still equal.

### Commodity Price Limits - Very Little Grain Trading

Yesterday, the grain market saw scarce supply and little demand, resulting in very light trading. This was because sellers were unwilling to easily sell due to a lack of inventory, while shops on Muji Street were reluctant to purchase due to price controls. Thus, the market was mutually exclusive. Only 50 bales of Chongming sand silkworm pupae were traded, priced at $134. 300 bales of July futures contracts for Sanxin small package bran were priced at $116.

### Preserved Tangerines Watched Closely

The preserved tangerines that arrived from the suppliers sold out quickly because the Northern merchants have quite a need for them, and the market was brisk. It is said that the supply of tangerine cakes in the producing areas is already low, so even if telegrams are sent to urge shipment, the number of arrivals will be limited. Therefore, the future market may see further price increases.

### Few Sugar Shares Offered

Sugar merchant cooperative business office sugar shares, recently because the place has dividends to distribute, so the output is very small, transaction is sparse crude sugar shares of 301 yuan, and a small five corners, the deal four white bags, after the lack of make, raw sugar shares called the original price, no deal.

### Jewelry Gold - Even Inter-Dealer Trading Is Light

Yesterday, the retail price of jewelry gold at Dasin Jewelers in this city remained unchanged at 2,100 yuan per tael. The buying price was reduced by about 300 yuan. Inter-dealer trading prices fluctuated within a small range, and the trading volume was even lower. Initially, it was 1,877 yuan and 5 jiao, up by one and a half yuan. Then, it was seen at 1,870 yuan. Xiangrong was buying in small amounts, pushing it up by 15 yuan to 1,885 yuan. At noon, it was 1,875 yuan, the same as the previous day's price, with a difference of 15 yuan. Trading was light. Jewelry silver was listed at 14 yuan per tael, and the inter-dealer price was around 11 yuan.

### Military Note Discount Rate - No Change

Yesterday in the foreign exchange market, the Japanese military notes were flat. The inter-dealer price was about 5 yuan, 5 jiao, 5 fen, 5 and 7 li, unchanged. As a result, the banks and small money shops sold them at 5 yuan, 5 jiao, and 7 fen and bought them at 5 yuan, 5 jiao, and 5 fen.

Yesterday, the discount rate of the Commercial Practice Association remained flat at one jiao and three fen. The new clearing houses are settling cash at par. Five Continents Jiangsu Local Banks.

The exchange number of the Five Continents Bank in the exchange is 52-12, and the exchange number of the Jiangsu Local Bank in the exchange is 52-14.

### As I Heard It: Song Dezhu

— Sick Dove

Song Dezhu is famous in the opera world as a female martial role, partly because of her skills and partly because of her good relationships. A guest inquired about Song's life experience, so I wrote this article to tell you about it.

Learning Experiences

Song Dezhu is from Tianjin, Hebei. Her family was in business, but by the time of her father, the family fortune had declined. Song's father sent Dezhu to a drama school. At that time, Dezhu was only twelve years old. She started with female lead roles and then studied female martial roles. She was nurtured by famous teachers such as Jiu Jianfeng, Zhu Guifang, Guo Jixiang, and Yu Yuqin, and her skills became great. In 1937, the Beiping Liyan Daily organized a child actors' election, and Dezhu received the most votes and won the female martial role champion, and her reputation became even more loud. When she was in school, Vice Principal Li Boyan loved her the most. He singled Dezhu out from among hundreds of students in the school, and taught and supervised her strictly, as if she were his own daughter, and also choreographed a new play "Princess Pingyang" for her. The martial arts in the play had many new and interesting things, such as the dance of "Ruyi Shuang Gou," which was matched with ancient melodies such as the Suzhou Narcissus and the Beside the Dressing Table. The ancient colors were ancient, and it was pleasant to hear and entertaining to see, and people called it that. At the same time, he also hired national martial artist Gao Ziyun to teach Tai Chi Arhat Qiankun sparring sword. This kind of technology can work hard, and it will help the figure of the female role. Song Dezhu's achievements today are based on this.

First Time Forming a Group

On New Year's Day in 1939, Dezhu formed a group for the first time and performed at the Xin Xin Theater in Beiping, taking the lead as a female martial role, creating a record in the opera world. The repertoire was the entire Yang Paifeng. Her supporting cast included Chen Shengsun and Wang Shengyi as female leads, Zhong Mingqi as a male martial role, Lu Fengshan as a male character with a beard, Xiao Debin and Zhao Xun as martial roles with painted faces, Yin Jinzhen as a martial clown, Xiu Dexin as an old male character, and Li Debin as a young male character. Most of them were former students of the opera school.

Failed to Go Abroad

In 1939, the Golden Gate Exposition was held in San Francisco, USA. At that time, Li Boyan was working overseas and wanted to send the Song troupe to the United States to participate in the performance, to win glory for the country and individuals. In addition, with the encouragement of Chinese-American movie star Anna May Wong, he was willing to provide economic assistance. Therefore, letters and telegrams were exchanged, and negotiations had already begun, but in the end, personnel problems could not be resolved. Moreover, the country was in a time of turmoil, and she did not want to make a show of it. The effort failed, which is a pity.

A Glimpse of Artistic Affairs

Song Dezhu is a specialist in female martial roles. Most of her skills were learned from Jiu Jianfeng. The thrilling and swift movements of the audience's shots are quite similar. The set of moves she plays is complete, with many patterns, and rarely the same. Her attitude is calm and unhurried, and there are often beautiful female lead movements interspersed between them, graceful and charming, and very lovely. Dezhu is the first person to be both strong and soft in martial roles. The "standing" and "slope" of the high-soled shoes are mutually available, deeply containing the doctrine of the mean, advancing and retreating as desired, and are beautiful. It is a pity that the skills of going down the stairs and standing still are slightly lacking, and they can often be seen when playing fast guns. Song Dezhu's narrow voice is suitable for singing female lead roles, and she should practice more diligently. Otherwise, in addition to martial roles, she may as well learn flower roles, and she may not be able to show her strength in the role. Art is valued for its excellence rather than its breadth, and I deeply believe that the latter is true.

### Sun Jianqiu's Artistic Achievements Are Rapidly Improving

— Hai Sheng

Beautiful female lead Sun Jianqiu, who performs at the Gengxin Stage, is excellent in both beauty and art. This time, Song Dezhu came to Shanghai to perform Butterfly Lovers, Mermaid, An Accidental Romance, and Flower Field Wrong. Jianqiu's co-performance is a wonderful combination of green leaves and shadows. Jianqiu strives for further studies. Yi Yang, a famous comedian, told him about He Zhu Pei and Little Shepherd Boy. Playwright Weng Ouhong praised him very much and recommended him as a rising star. Jianqiu will soon be listed as a goddaughter under the tutelage of famous amateur opera singer Hu Gengyun.

### Dynamics of the Qingguang Troupe

— Liang Ren

The Qingguang Troupe's first performance of "Parasitic Grass" was directed by Zheng Gezhi, an overseas Chinese from Malaysia, and won unanimous praise from all walks of life. It is now actively rehearsing the seven-act sad literary drama "A Good Time for Flowers and Moon", which is tortuous, bizarre, new and extraordinary. It is decided that the Mid-Autumn Festival will be performed at Longshan, and the location is being negotiated with a major theater. Then, the five-act passionate song and dance drama "South China Sea Love Song" was directed by Gezhi, and Zheng Lizhen, a dance expert from overseas Chinese, and musician Yang Songping were the song and dance instructors. It is said that the troupe still does not have enough actors, and those who love drama and have some experience can apply to participate by sending a letter to the troupe at 123 Datong Road.

### Xue Jin in "Blood and Tears"

— Fan Shiren

Mentioning the name Xue Jin seems to be very unfamiliar to everyone, right? Indeed, even I had not heard of it before. I discovered this artist with great acting talent only recently. On a clear and breezy autumn night, I was invited by a friend to see the premiere of the "Blood and Tears" drama by the Unnamed Troupe at the Xuan Palace. I saw this excellent and promising young man for the first time. He played a romantic bandit leader in the play, appearing in the second act. When he appeared on stage, the audience in the whole theater immediately fell silent, no longer as noisy and restless as in the first and second acts. Everyone sat quietly and attentively, and gave a warm round of applause when they were happy. I don't criticize how delicate and expressive the acting skills of the people on stage are, but I can see whether the emotions of the people off stage are controlled by the performers; as long as the spirit of the actors and the hearts of the audience are intertwined, and the emotion is like an electric shock, then the artist's artistic career can be admitted to a proper state; and all the essence of an artist is also placed here. Xue Jin, among many unknown artists, is one who is full of this kind of charm.

The moment when the bandit's lair was wiped out in the fourth act was the climax of the whole play. Like other excellent actors, he was able to grasp the center of the climax and keep the atmosphere of the whole scene in extreme tension from beginning to end. In the midst of the gunfire, his last action was to drink bullets and die. When the curtain fell, the stage was full of corpses, and my forehead was covered with beads of sweat.

Someone who knows Xue Jin said that he is only twenty years old this year, and he has not been a basic actor in the Unnamed Troupe for long. He has played roles with absolutely different personalities, such as Wang Weiren in A Woman's Heart, Zou Ping in Thunderstorm, and Committee Member Luo in Women's Apartment. He can be said to be good at acting, but it is said that the owner of the troupe does not value him very much. This disadvantage may be based on his youth and poverty!

### Dynamics of the Art Garden

— One Qing

Tang Huaiqiu and Tang Caiqing will prepare to go to northern China to perform with a large number of people in the name of "China Touring Troupe" after the end of the Huanghou.

The Art Troupe is actively preparing for The Earth. I have invited Shu Shi to be the director, and Shu Shi is still considering it.

Lan Xin decided to seal the building today. Zhao, Zhu, and Sun, the managers of the theater, personally inspected everything. After Lu Luming's "The Young Lady's Fan" is finished, the right to perform will be officially exercised, and two gentlemen from the drama world will be responsible for carrying it out.

After the CZC company was dissolved, Li Jianwu showed discouragement and had no intention of operating it. "Kugan" organized by Zuo Lin may have the possibility of cooperating with "Huayi".

### Peace Charity Performance

— Hai Zi

Today, the Peace Box Office will hold a charity performance at the Grand Stage for the Tongren Fuyuan Hall. There will be two performances day and night. The main repertoires of the daytime performance are "Broken Bridge" by Gu Zhenxiang, Zhu Biming, and Zhu Chuanfang, "Qianyuan Mountain" by Er Chen Dingxin, and "Fishing and Killing Family" by He Songnian, Gu Yixiang, and Cao Xueqin. The evening performance is "Battle of Changsha" by Li Yuanlong and Zhan Xiaoling, "The Story of the Horse Trader" by Fei Xizhen and Gu Zhenxiang, and "Catching and Releasing Cao" by Gu Yixiang. It is said that sales and donations have reached 50,000 to 60,000 yuan. The picture shows a small casual photo of Mr. Gu Yixiang.

### Sharing the Same Boat in Wind and Rain

— He Jia Zhi

(8) What Can Be Done

Wei Yunqing forgot that the abacus hit the table, smashed a nail, and broke the copper skin. Now he picked up the abacus and slapped it on the table again, shouting: "Shao Yun, are you my father or am I your father? Speak, why are you so unreasonable? I'm so old, I've long wanted to hand over the household affairs to you, but I see that you're just a frivolous young man and I'm not very relieved. You don't study, and you don't do business. I don't ask you to take care of the family's affairs, but you're starting to take care of the family's affairs for your father. Go! Go read a book, even if you don't read it out loud, just read, read until the new year, and I'll give you some money, at least ten yuan, so you can have fun in the new year." Wei Shaoyun heard that ten yuan was a small amount, but Wei Yunqing said that ten yuan was a large amount. The two people's psychology was different, so Wei Shaoyun smiled and said, "Dad, why are you using ten yuan to tempt me? I'm asking you, who is the woman in my house? I want to take a look, why won't you let me see? I guess it's the woman that Fei Changhe brought, and she won't be pretty. But the pretty that I'm talking about is not that high of a standard, as long as she's better than your daughter-in-law, then she's pretty."

Wei Yunqing said, "Beast! In the end, I don't know where I'm talking about. You think that just because you married a wife, I can't hit you? There's no such thing. If you make me angry, I'll still hit you. Have you forgotten? Ten years ago, I broke a bamboo pole. Go! Go to your daughter-in-law's place! See how much of the blue-striped red-checkered cloth she's woven. You don't listen to me when I talk nicely, you won't get any benefits. Qin Runzhi said that he's coming today, it's about time he'll be here. If you don't listen to me, and people outside know about it, it'll be a joke." Wei Shaoyun raised his head and thought for a while, stomped his leather shoes on the ground, and walked out. Wei Yunqing walked lightly to the door. When he saw where he was going, he was walking outside the gate, and then he was relieved. He muttered to himself again, "Rebellious wife and wicked son, intertwined in the past life. Sigh! (173)"
