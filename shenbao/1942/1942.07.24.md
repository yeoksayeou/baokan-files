### German Breakthrough on the Front Lines, Rostov Increasingly Critical, Don River Bend Completely Occupied by German Forces, Soviet Reinforcements Prepare for a Decisive Stand

Lisbon, Allied News Agency, 22nd - According to a Moscow dispatch from the Soviet Information Bureau on the night of the 22nd, it was admitted that German forces had broken through Soviet resistance and advanced to a point 25 kilometers northeast of Rostov. Fierce close combat is currently underway in that area. The German forces advancing towards Stalingrad are fiercely attacking Soviet forces along the Don River at Nikine Kaskaya, 110 kilometers southwest of the city. Due to the heavy pressure from the German forces, the Soviet forces on all fronts have been forced to retreat to new positions.

Soviet Border, Havas News Agency, 22nd - Today marks the 295th day of the German-Soviet war. The general situation on various front lines is as follows: (1) The Don River "bend" is almost entirely occupied by German forces; (2) The lower reaches of the Don River have been crossed by German forces and their allies; (3) Rostov is surrounded on three sides and can only maintain communication with the outside world by sea; (4) The two major battles of Rostov and the Don River bend are coming to an end. The Red Army, which has been holding the Donets region, is now retreating across the Don River via Rostov. However, bridges near Rostov have been bombed by German aircraft, and the Red Army is practically surrounded. The number of those surrounded is estimated to be about one million. At the same time, according to Soviet sources, the Red Army authorities have transferred a large number of reinforcements behind the Krasnodar-Stalingrad railway line, preparing for a decisive battle.

Berlin, Havas News Agency, 22nd - The High Command announced this morning that German forces and Slovak troops have broken through the front lines of Rostov and advanced to the suburbs of the city. The enemy forces on the front lines were unable to retreat towards Rostov, and a portion has already been annihilated. The German Air Force has been bombing the railways south of the Don River day and night, and enemy troop movements have also been bombed. Repeated fierce offensives by the Red Army northwest of Voronezh have been repelled after fierce fighting. A German infantry division destroyed 39 Red Army tanks in the fighting. The Red Army, which was surrounded behind our lines in the central sector, attempted to break through unsuccessfully. General Ivanovo, commander of the 18th Cavalry Division, and many officers were killed. Enemy attempts to break through the lines at Voronezh and Leningrad were again unsuccessful.

Ankara, Allied News Agency, 23rd - According to Soviet reports, a large number of Soviet reserve troops are concentrated northeast of the Voronezh-Stalingrad-Astrakhan railway line to prevent German forces from advancing towards the Volga. The commander of the reserve troops is reportedly Marshal Voroshilov, former commander of the Leningrad Military District.

Moscow, Allied News Agency, 23rd - The Soviet communiqué, issued at midnight, stated that a major battle was taking place in the Tsimlyanskaya area, which is only twelve miles from Rostov. The communiqué also stated that on the 22nd of this month, Soviet forces fought in Voronezh, Tsimlyanskaya, and Novocherkassk (20 miles north of Rostov). There were no changes on other fronts.

Stockholm, Havas News Agency, 22nd - According to Berlin sources, the Red Army's position in the Rostov area is extremely critical. German forces are only three miles from the city center. It is reported that the German attack on the city from the east was unexpected by the Red Army General Staff. Although the German advance encountered various difficulties, such as crossing large rivers, adverse weather, heavy rain, and determined Red Army resistance, the German forces were still able to advance rapidly along the Don River basin. As for the German forces advancing on Rostov from the west, they were ordered to advance only after the city was practically completely surrounded. At present, communication between the city and the Red Army to the south has been cut off. According to German military experts, the garrison of Rostov cannot escape encirclement by German forces. However, the Red Army High Command will organize a strong defensive line, as the fate of the Caucasus hinges on the city. Abandoning it rashly will inevitably affect the Red Army's morale. General Timoshenko may sacrifice the garrison of Rostov in order to gain enough time to establish a second line of defense to protect the Stalingrad-Voroshilov railroad, thereby blocking German forces from directly approaching the Caucasus. Another major military action is expected in the eastern sector. It is reported that German forces have reached a point 30 miles from Stalingrad, in the Donets River basin. German forces are continuing to pursue the retreating Red Army, but recent heavy rains have made the roads muddy and transportation difficult, slowing the German advance. General von Manstein's troops crossed the Kerch Strait yesterday and occupied a stronghold on the Taman Peninsula. The German Air Force is very active in the skies over the Eastern Front and has contributed greatly to defeating the retreating Red Army units. However, according to Moscow, the Red Army is fighting well between Voronezh and the Don River. News reports from war correspondents also state that fighting is still raging in Voronezh. German forces have had to withdraw their heavy artillery from the left bank of the Don River and have lost three strongholds, one of which has been recaptured by the Red Army, while the other two have been destroyed by Soviet aircraft. This has been confirmed by Berlin. The German Air Force is playing an extremely important role in the fighting in the Voronezh area. Since the fall of the city on the 7th of this month, German aircraft have been constantly bombing both banks of the Don River, as the Red Army has repeatedly attempted to cross the river and recapture the city under the cover of motorized units and artillery. However, repeated Red Army counterattacks have been repelled by German forces. In one day, German bombers destroyed 44 Soviet tanks, and a large number of trucks carrying troops and ammunition were also destroyed, so the enemy forces were unable to break through the defensive line or approach Voronezh.

### Gordov Promoted to Lieutenant General

Moscow, Havas News Agency, 23rd - The People's Committee today promoted Major General Gordov to Lieutenant General.

### Kuybyshev Air Raid Alert

Angora, United Press Agency, 23rd - According to information received here, Kuybyshev, the temporary capital of the Soviet Union, issued an air raid alert for the first time yesterday morning. The first alert was at 2:00 AM and lasted for two hours before being lifted. The second alert was issued at 9:00 AM, but was lifted after a few minutes. Further details are unknown.

### Heavy Snow in Southern France

Paris, United Press Agency, 23rd - According to information received here, the weather in southern France is abnormal. After many days of hot weather, heavy snow has suddenly fallen in the past two days.

### Explosions Heard Miles Away as Rostov is Surrounded on Three Sides

Rome, Havas News Agency, 22nd - An Italian war correspondent recently reported from the Eastern Front that the capture of Rostov is only a matter of hours. The city is ablaze, and the Red Army is destroying all factories and important buildings throughout the city. The explosions can be heard for miles. Rostov is now surrounded on three sides, and the first line of defense has been breached by German forces and their allies. All the bridges over the Don River have been destroyed, and the Red Army can only continue to retreat by rafts and small boats. The first German force to make contact with the defenders came from the south, starting from Taganrog and advancing along the coast of the Sea of Azov. The area is full of bunkers, making combat difficult. The second force came from the north, consisting of motorized units. It first captured Voroshilovgrad and then crossed the Donets River east of the city, unexpectedly attacking the rear of the Rostov defenders by advancing south through the swampy area. The third force came from the east. After dispersing the Red Army at Millerovo and cutting off rail communication between the Donets River region and Stalingrad, it advanced along the Don River and then changed direction southwest at the confluence of the Donets and Don Rivers, thereby approaching the outskirts of Rostov. The Red Army did not anticipate this move by the German forces and had not prepared for it. The German forces were therefore able to drive straight in, sweeping all before them. In addition, German forces are now rushing towards Stalingrad at maximum speed. The city will soon be surrounded, and its rail link with Moscow is in danger of being cut off, as the line passes near the Don River and is now within range of German heavy artillery. The force attacking Stalingrad is about an army corps, advancing along a broad front. The main task of the Red Army High Command at present is to defend the northern Caucasus oil fields.

### Soviet Union at a Life-or-Death Crossroads, Troops Encouraged to Fight Hard

Moscow, Allied News Agency, 23rd - General von Bock is intensifying his attack on Rostov with fresh troops from the rear, with a view to seizing the Caucasus and Stalingrad. German forces are pressing Timoshenko's infantry and gradually increasing their mechanized units, aiming to cut a corridor through the Soviet lines. The attacks on the above-mentioned two cities have clearly begun. In 1919, Stalin repelled General Denikin at Stalingrad. This time, he is facing a formidable enemy for the second time in the same location. Therefore, the Soviet press is earnestly appealing to Soviet soldiers and the people in the rear to defend with all their strength, saying that today is a life-or-death crossroads that does not allow for the slightest relaxation. Ilyichov said, "The motherland must be saved, and the enemy must be destroyed."

### Roosevelt and Litvinov Hold Important Talks, Opening of a Second Front Expected to Be on the Agenda

Lisbon, Allied News Agency, 23rd - According to a Washington dispatch, Soviet Ambassador to the United States Litvinov met with President Roosevelt at the White House yesterday. This matter is extremely important. Afterwards, Litvinov declined to comment, saying, "I cannot disclose what I discussed with the President." However, he only said that the issue of opening a second front would certainly be on the agenda. When reporters asked if it was true that he had asked the President to immediately open a second front, as reported yesterday, Litvinov replied, "This statement was made before I met with the President." After the conclusion of President Roosevelt's meeting with Litvinov, a lengthy Pacific military conference was convened, making it all the more clear that their talks were related to the issue of opening a second front.

London, Havas News Agency, 22nd - President Roosevelt met with Soviet Ambassador to the United States Litvinov today. A few hours later, he also met with Brigadier General Brett, commander of the first American air force aid to the Soviet Union.

Stockholm, Havas News Agency, 23rd - According to reports, a London dispatch stated that when Soviet Ambassador to the United States Litvinov met with President Roosevelt today, he insisted on immediately opening a second front. Otherwise, German forces would invade the Caucasus, at which point Soviet troops could only resort to guerrilla warfare. It would then be impossible to prevent the Germans from transferring three million troops to Western Europe. This second front need not be large in scale and need not be on the European continent. A diversionary offensive in Europe or elsewhere would be sufficient.

Bern, Havas News Agency, 23rd - The Swiss News Agency reports from New York that President Roosevelt and Soviet Ambassador Litvinov met today with members of the Pacific Military Committee to discuss the issue of American air force aid to the Soviet Union. Whether the opening of a second front in Europe was discussed is unknown. Admiral Leahy, the newly appointed chief of staff to the president, also attended the meeting, but he declined to comment on his new responsibilities.

Berlin, Havas News Agency, 22nd - A correspondent for the Swedish newspaper *Svenska Dagbladet* recently visited American troops stationed in Northern Ireland. It is reported that the American troops there are not currently preparing for action. They can only participate in the European war at a later date. As for the issue of opening a second front, everything depends on the degree of British preparedness.

#### U.S. Publicly Acknowledges the Seriousness of the Situation

Washington, Havas News Agency, 22nd - Political figures here are fully aware of the Red Army's setbacks on the Don River and today publicly admitted that the current situation is nearly the worst the "Allies" have faced since the Dunkirk evacuation. "If the Red Army were to unfortunately collapse, then victory would become impossible." Soviet Ambassador to the United States Litvinov's two meetings with President Roosevelt today have increased the general tension here. However, Ambassador Litvinov refused to make any comments, presumably he again appealed to the United States to "immediately open a second front in Europe before it is too late." The newspapers here are not only examining the significance of the Red Army's defeat in the Ukraine, but also discussing the successes the Axis powers have achieved on other battlefronts, including shipping problems. For example, the renowned military expert Baldwin published an article in the Washington *Evening Star* today, saying, "After the Nazis drive the Red Army out of the Don River region, the fertile plain between the Don and Volga Rivers will lose its shield and become wide open. From now on, every inch of land occupied by German forces will be a fatal blow to the Soviet Union. This is one. In North Africa, the enemy will soon advance to the Nile Valley and are currently concentrating troops, tanks, and artillery, preparing to launch a decisive attack on the Middle East. This is two. Although our merchant ship losses along the coast and in the Caribbean Sea have decreased compared to the past, their losses are still greater than the number of new ships being built. This is three." The tone of the press is pessimistic, clearly influenced by the White House, as the government wants to make the people aware of the environment, thereby creating a sense of being in extraordinary times. When President Roosevelt hosted the press yesterday, he announced that Secretary of State Hull plans to give a radio address to the nation in the coming days, clarifying "the seriousness of the current war." As for the issue of opening a second front in Europe, it remains the focus of discussion among general military experts and strategists. According to the Washington *Evening Star*, the Allies need at least 500,000 "elite British and American troops" to land in Europe. These troops and their necessary supplies are undoubtedly already in Britain. In addition to this, the Allies probably still have sufficient air power to gain air superiority over the coasts of France, Belgium, and the Netherlands. The Allies' only weakness is probably the issue of ship tonnage. All the current ships are only sufficient to transport arms and supplies to Britain, Australia, and the Soviet Union. In addition, their sinking rate is higher than the rate of building new ships. For this reason, the Allies are estimating ten tons of shipping per soldier for the 500,000-man expeditionary force, meaning that the existing ships are still likely to be insufficient.

Stockholm, United Press Agency, 23rd - According to Swedish newspapers, Britain and the United States are loudly proclaiming the opening of a second front, but the two governments have not yet shown the slightest indication of how they will proceed with this matter. The London correspondent of the Swedish newspaper *Svenska Dagbladet* said that, in principle, the Allies want to wait until next spring, but in order to relieve the plight of the Soviet Union and Egypt, it may be possible to launch operations in Western Europe earlier. If the Soviet Union knows for sure that there is no possibility of opening a second front this year, the Soviet military's morale may collapse. Moreover, the Soviet government has acknowledged in principle that the second front needs to be implemented as soon as possible. Workers in Morecambe and Lancaster, England, held a mass meeting yesterday and unanimously resolved to remind the government of its promise to establish a second front in Europe this year. The resolution stated that this front could relieve the Soviet Union on the one hand and prevent Germany from establishing a second front against Britain on the other. This shows one aspect of the attitude of the British working class.

### Gandhi Leads Indian Masses in Advancing the Disobedience Movement, Indian Government Withdraws Ban on the Communist Party

Lisbon, Allied News Agency, 22nd - According to a broadcast received here today from San Francisco, Gandhi has implemented the preliminary work of the disobedience movement on the 22nd, asking all Indian merchants to support the resolution passed by the Congress Working Committee demanding that British forces withdraw from India, and ordering all shops to close in order to resist the British.

Tokyo, Allied News Agency, 23rd - The Saigon special dispatch of the *Asahi Shimbun* stated that, according to information received in Saigon, after Gandhi issued several statements, it is generally believed that the matter of his guiding the Indian people to launch a non-cooperation movement cannot be avoided. The anxiety of political circles in London is therefore all the more profound. According to a report from the New Delhi correspondent of the Independent News of India, it is rumored that in order to promote the resolution of the National Congress against British resistance over the past month, as soon as the All-India Committee of the National Congress Party convenes in Bombay on August 7, the National Congress Party will begin an open resistance against the Indian government on the issue of Indian independence.

Lisbon, Allied News Agency, 22nd - After the Indian National Congress adopted an anti-British resolution, the British side used all kinds of hard and soft tactics against the Indian independence movement. According to a Reuters dispatch from New Delhi, the Indian government has announced that, in view of the fact that the Indian Communist Party has recently changed its position and expressed its support for the current war effort, the Indian government has withdrawn its ban on the party in order to give it the opportunity to implement this attempt. The ban on the publication of its organ newspapers, "National Front" and "New Age," has also been lifted.

### Sumatra: Administrative Policy Includes Six Principles

Tokyo, United Press Agency, 23rd - Sumatra has been placed under the jurisdiction of the Malayan Administrative Bureau and is no longer directly governed by Japan. Japanese political circles regard this as a sign of Japan's emphasis on the future development of Sumatra. According to the *Yomiuri Shimbun*, Sumatra's administrative policy includes six principles: (1) The advantages of the Dutch East Indies administrative structure will be retained as much as possible; (2) The hereditary rights of the local chiefs will be respected so that they will cooperate with Japan; (3) Efforts will be made to improve plantations; (4) The economic power of the overseas Chinese will be utilized; (5) Local customs will be respected and the lives of the natives will be improved; (6) The east coast will be the center of Japanese power. The east coast, along the Strait of Malacca, is very important strategically. The plantations and economic power there will be controlled by Japan.

### Nanjing Central Political Conference

### British Forces Launch Fierce Counterattack on the Egyptian Front, Occupy the El Alamein Heights in the North

Stockholm, United Press Agency, 23rd - According to a report from the Exchange Telegraph Company, British forces in Egypt began attacking the German-Italian positions at El Alamein yesterday. Axis forces are resisting fiercely. The front line is 64 kilometers long, and the sandstorms make combat extremely difficult. General Auchinleck is now using various different tactics, which are completely different from those used by former General Ritchie.

Stockholm, Allied News Agency, 22nd - According to news from the Egyptian front, fierce fighting has taken place in the El Alamein area in the central sector of the Egyptian front in the past few days. The territory occupied by Axis forces in the area of the British positions has formed a salient. British forces in North Africa are now actively seeking to reverse the imminent collapse of the situation. Marshal Rommel is waiting for an opportunity to begin a major offensive.

Cairo, Havas News Agency, 21st - The British Middle East Command recently issued a war report stating that fierce fighting has taken place on all sectors of the Egyptian front in the past 24 hours. Last night, our forces carried out a counterattack in the central sector. Our forces in the north have occupied the El Alamein Heights. Enemy forces are also carrying out counterattacks on all lines.

Madrid, United Press Agency, 23rd - According to London reports, British newspapers stated that it takes 40 to 50 days for Britain to transport artillery and other war materials to North Africa. Although bombers can fly to North Africa in 22 days, fighter planes cannot fly long distances non-stop. At present, they are all transported by ship to the coast of West Africa and then flown to Egypt. Americans are actively active in Africa and have a strong tendency to seize the power of the British Empire. Traces of Americans can be found everywhere on the new transport route from West Africa to the Suez Canal.

London, Havas News Agency, 23rd - The Air Ministry announced this morning that there was slight enemy aircraft activity over Britain last night. Southeastern England was the main target of the bombing. Property has been damaged and eight people have been seriously injured.

Berlin, Havas News Agency, 22nd - This morning's newspapers reported that fresh German troops have arrived on the El Alamein front in Egypt to assist in the fighting.

Rome, Havas News Agency, 22nd - The High Command announced this morning that fierce fighting continued in the El Alamein area of Egypt yesterday, with results favorable to the Axis forces. The enemy suffered heavy losses, and 800 prisoners were taken, mostly New Zealand and Indian troops. 130 enemy tanks were destroyed. The Axis Air Force participated in the battle several times. German fighter planes shot down six enemy planes, and Italian fighter planes shot down three enemy planes. Italian anti-aircraft guns also shot down one plane. As a result of an air raid on Malta, the damage to the Mikabba air base was the most severe. As a result of an aerial battle northeast of Port Said, four enemy Spitfire planes were shot down. Italian aircraft launched aerial torpedoes and sank a 10,000-ton merchant ship in an enemy convoy. At that time, enemy anti-aircraft fire was very intense, and several Italian aviation personnel were injured.

### Turkish Border: Taking Precautionary Measures; Turkish President on Tour in Anatolia

Berlin, 22nd (Allied News Agency) - According to a German news agency, it is rumored that the Turkish government has suddenly sealed off a portion of its border adjacent to the Soviet Union. Political circles believe that this action by Turkey is to guard against the possibility of Soviet forces on the southern section of the Eastern Front, after some shifts in the war situation, invading Turkish territory for safety. This already indicates the approach Turkey is taking towards the war on the Eastern Front.

Ankara, 23rd (Haitong News Agency) - Turkish President İsmet İnönü, accompanied by Prime Minister Refik Saydam, is touring the central Anatolia region and has now arrived in Konya. The second stop is expected to be the city of Ereğli.

### Enhanced Friendship Between Germany and Turkey

Istanbul, 22nd (Havas News Agency) - In accordance with the German-Turkish economic agreement signed last October, Germany has begun supplying Turkey with railway materials. The first batch, including multiple locomotives, 400 passenger and freight cars, and other railway materials, has already arrived here. It is noted that last winter, Britain transported 90 locomotives to Turkey, but this shipment was ordered from Britain before the outbreak of the current war.

Berlin, 23rd (Haitong News Agency) - The Turkish press delegation currently visiting Germany yesterday visited the Wünsdorf tank training camp. The head of the Turkish intelligence service, Salih Omurtak, also participated. After the delegation's inspection, the camp commander hosted a banquet.

One British destroyer was shot down, and two were heavily damaged.

Berlin, 23rd (Haitong News Agency) - According to a German High Command announcement, British aircraft attacked military targets along the Channel coast yesterday but were repelled by German aircraft and anti-aircraft guns. One Spitfire was shot down, and there was no military damage.

### Japan and the United States Exchange Nationals at Portuguese East Africa

Lourenço Marques, 22nd (Allied News Agency) - The Japanese ships "Asama Maru" and "Conte Verde," carrying British and American diplomatic personnel and others evacuated from Japan, China, the Philippines, Thailand, and various parts of East Asia, arrived here today. They will exchange with Japanese diplomatic personnel stationed in the United States and Central and South American countries, who are expected to arrive there on the "Gripsholm" on July 20th. They are scheduled to sail back to the Far East on July 26th.

Lisbon, 23rd (Haitong News Agency) - The exchange of Japanese nationals and British and American nationals evacuated from enemy territory recently took place in Lourenço Marques, with amicable attitudes and good results. According to British and American nationals, they traveled from Shanghai or other major cities in the Far East aboard the Italian ship "Conte Verde" or the Japanese ship "Asama Maru" to Europe, and their treatment was excellent, which they were very pleased with.

London, 22nd (Havas News Agency) - Foreign Secretary Eden recently announced in the House of Commons that the British and Japanese governments, through the mediation of the Swiss government, have reached an agreement to exchange 1,800 British and Allied nationals in the Far East with an equal number of Japanese and Thai nationals in Britain for repatriation. The exchange will be conducted at the port of Lourenço Marques in Portuguese East Africa. The Portuguese government has expressed its permission. The exchange will be conducted in two batches. The first batch will include all British and Allied officials in Japan, Manchuria, Vietnam, Thailand, and the Philippines and is scheduled to arrive at Lourenço Marques on the 27th of next month. The second batch will be British nationals in those countries, who will be repatriated on ships carrying Japanese nationals from Britain back to Japan. The first batch of British nationals and officials evacuated are expected to arrive back in Britain from Portuguese East Africa around September 30th of this year. The other batch will wait in South Africa for the 900 British nationals evacuated from the Far East on September 7th to arrive before traveling west together, with an estimated arrival in Britain around October 7th. The Japanese government has not agreed to exchange British nationals in Hong Kong, Singapore, and other British territories occupied by Japan since December 7, 1941. At the same time, the Japanese-American exchange of evacuated nationals does not include American nationals in the Philippines, but the Japanese government has accepted the principle of exchanging non-official nationals in the Philippines. The evacuation list will be announced soon. In summary, the government will continue to work on this matter, and perhaps other achievements may be made in the short term, but I do not believe that public debate will help these negotiations. The German side is expected to issue a note soon regarding the safety of the evacuation ships. British and German negotiations are also being conducted through Switzerland and are progressing smoothly, but it cannot yet be said that guarantees have been secured.

Saigon, 23rd (Haitong News Agency) - The Australian government has announced that it will exchange nationals with Japan. The ship carrying Japanese nationals will depart within half a month, including the Japanese minister to Australia. Exchanges will also be made with Germany and Italy in the future.

### Allied Military Conference Held in Australia Yesterday

London, 22nd (Havas News Agency) - Labor Minister Bevin recently announced in the House of Commons that the government has drafted measures to expand conscription, stipulating that Britons residing overseas are also subject to enlistment. This bill is scheduled to be submitted to Parliament for discussion next week and will first be implemented in Egypt, as the situation there is urgent and all manpower must be mobilized. Britons residing in the various dominions, colonies, and mandated territories are not included. When this bill is implemented, difficulties will inevitably be encountered in certain countries, such as France, where it will be difficult to implement.

### United States Collects Scrap Metal Nationwide

Washington, 22nd (Havas News Agency) - Secretary of War Henry Stimson today ordered all military agencies across the country to collect scrap metal and all old, useless iron products, such as useless cannons and vehicles, etc. However, "ancient weapons" of historical value are not subject to requisition.

### Rumor of Argentine Foreign Minister Saying They Are Leaving the Pan-American Group; Hull Claims to Know Nothing

Buenos Aires, 22nd (Allied News Agency) - Foreign Minister Ruiz Guiñazú stated in a foreign policy speech in the lower house on the 22nd that Argentina is severing relations with the Pan-American Group and that Argentina will no longer be bound by any resolutions of the Rio de Janeiro Conference.

Buenos Aires, 22nd (Allied News Agency) - Argentine Foreign Minister Ruiz Guiñazú announced in the lower house on the 22nd that the Argentine government, in view of the fact that some countries in the Americas disregard the decisions of the Pan-American Foreign Ministers' Conference and declare war on the Axis without prior consultation with Argentina, hereby announces that Argentina is no longer bound by the resolutions of the Third American Foreign Ministers' Conference held in January of this year. The U.S. government declared war on Japan three days after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, which left ample time to consult with countries in the Americas, but the United States did not do so and did not obtain the understanding of the countries in the Americas beforehand. Argentina does not wish to fulfill the obligations of the Third American Foreign Ministers' Conference Convention, and that is the reason. The United States previously proposed that Argentine ships escort a portion of the American coastal shipping lines, which the Argentine government immediately rejected. Avoiding being drawn into the dangers of war is, of course, the proper course of action at this time. If Argentina participates in the implementation of the escort system, unfortunate incidents will inevitably occur. In the past, Argentina suffered a torpedo attack. I dare to assert that it will not hinder Argentina's friendly relations with Germany. The Argentine government has decided that it will never associate with American countries that take hostile actions against the Axis.

Washington, 22nd (Havas News Agency) - It is rumored that Argentine Foreign Minister Ruiz Guiñazú made a speech during a secret meeting of the Argentine Congress, criticizing American imperialism, stating that it is undoubtedly true that the United States wants to control the American continent, which is an even more serious threat than the threat of a German victory. When Secretary of State Hull met with reporters today, he was asked about this. He replied that he had no knowledge of it and that the State Department had not received such reports. He himself did not believe that Guiñazú had made such remarks.

Buenos Aires, 22nd (Havas News Agency) - The Argentine oil tanker "Victoria" was torpedoed in the Caribbean Sea and sailed to the United States for repairs. The U.S. government has now decided to offer to buy the ship. Regarding this matter, the Foreign Minister recently spoke with the Minister of the Navy to discuss what attitude Argentina should take. President Castillo was also present. Afterwards, the Foreign Minister announced that although the U.S. government is willing to offer to buy our country's oil tanker "Victoria," the issue of whether the flag flown by the ship should be allowed to be changed is a matter for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and must be studied.

Washington, 23rd (Havas News Agency) - According to news from various news agencies here, Argentine Socialist Congressman Rapetto yesterday condemned Foreign Minister Ruiz Guiñazú, saying that he had leaked details of the recent secret meeting of the House of Representatives to the press and demanded that the House of Representatives publish the full text of the Foreign Minister's speech at the secret meeting, especially asking the Foreign Minister to explain why the government did not sever relations with the Axis countries.

Buenos Aires, 23rd (Havas News Agency) - An English newspaper reported that during a recent secret meeting of the Argentine House of Representatives, Foreign Minister Ruiz Guiñazú gave a speech, expressing satisfaction with the debate on foreign policy and that the motion to sever relations with the Axis countries was rejected by a majority.

### Portuguese Ship Sunk by Submarine

Washington, 22nd (Havas Agency) - The Navy Department announced that a small Portuguese ship was sunk by a submarine in the North Atlantic. Thirty-two crew members have arrived at a U.S. port, and only two are missing. This is the first Portuguese ship sunk in the North Atlantic.

### German Side Announces Tonnage of Merchant Ships Sunk

Berlin, 22nd (Allied News Agency) - German submarines have been actively operating in a vast area from the Arctic Ocean to the South Atlantic. Since the United States entered the war, their scope of operations has further expanded, and the number of merchant ships sunk has surged. Since the initial success of German submarines off the coast of the United States, only half a year has passed until the 24th of this month, but during this period, approximately 3,500,000 tons of merchant ships have been sunk, an average of 20,000 tons per day. Nearly half of them, about 200 ships totaling 1,500,000 tons, were oil tankers. The oil carried by these oil tankers is estimated at about 2,500,000 tons. The issue that Britain and the United States are most concerned about now is the problem of ships, and the German side is focusing all its efforts on sinking merchant ships to undermine the British and American economies. Therefore, the actions of German submarines and the development of the Eastern Front are both worthy of our attention.

### Japanese Military Administration in Burma Actively Develops Burma; Laying Railways to Facilitate Transportation; Plans to Utilize Hydropower for Electricity Generation

Rangoon, 22nd (Allied News Agency) - The Japanese military administration in Burma has decided to utilize the superior Japanese civil engineering science and technology to promote Burma's railway construction and power development plans. Firstly, in the Shan States in the north and south, which were previously ruled by the British policy of separation, resulting in thirty to forty large and small feudal tribes, mineral resources such as lead, zinc, copper, tungsten, and nickel are very abundant in the area, and most of the agricultural and forestry resources have not been developed. The current development plan is to first lay a new railway, starting from Taunggyi, establishing a transverse railway line, crossing the upper reaches of the Salween River eastward, crossing the new Mekong River, and connecting with Hanoi in Vietnam, with a total length of 1,070 kilometers and an estimated construction cost of over 255 million yuan, which can be completed in two years. Secondly, the waters of Burma's large rivers, the Irrawaddy and Salween Rivers, are quite abundant and can be used for hydropower generation. Personnel have been dispatched to investigate Burma's hydropower, and hydropower generation plans have been prepared. Currently, the total power generated by 174 large and small power plants in Burma is 93,000 kilowatts, of which only 17,000 kilowatts utilize hydropower. Since the Japanese army entered Burma, it has begun to study hydropower generation, and the plan will be completed when all of Burma is pacified. According to surveys, Burma's hydropower generation can actually reach a massive 3,000,000 kilowatts. If it can be fully completed, not only can the problem of floods in Burma during the rainy season be solved, but also the foundation for industrialization can be completed simultaneously. The military administration's power generation plan aims to generate 1 million kilowatts, designating two areas in the middle reaches of the Salween River and four areas including the Taunggyi area and the upper reaches of the Uyai River to begin work, with a total construction cost estimated at 610 million yuan. The initial stage of the project is planned to start in the Taunggyi area.

### To Prevent Collusion and Fraud; Food Ration Rice Shop Locations Changed; Implemented Starting with the Second Batch of Rice Purchase Certificates; Quantity of Rice Rationed in the Fourth Period to Be Announced Separately

The two concession authorities implemented rice rationing based on population. The deadline for purchasing rice with the third coupon of the first batch of rice purchase certificates is tomorrow. The fourth period will be sold from the 27th to the 1st of August. Regarding the allocation of rations for the fourth period, only white rice and flour are included. The broken rice item has been decided to be temporarily suspended. The quantity and price will be announced separately. However, the rice and grain office of the Public Works Department only allocates white rice and flour for the fourth period to each rice shop, without broken rice. The quantity of flour remains the same. The quantity of white rice is less than the combined quantity of white rice and broken rice in the previous period. For example, if the previous period was a total of forty bags of white rice and broken rice, this time there are only thirty-five bags of white rice, while the flour remains the same.

#### Rice Shops Changed Monthly

The location for receiving rice next month has changed. The rice purchase certificate issued by the Concession Rice and Grain Management Office to taxpayers does not have the same contracted rice shop number each month. For example, if the first batch of rice purchase certificates received in July designates purchasing rice from a certain rice shop, the second batch of rice received in August will change to a rice shop with another number. The method is designed to prevent collusion and fraud between rice shops and rice purchasers.

#### Authorities Urge Submission of Rice Sales Lists

The Rice and Grain Office of the Public Works Department issued a notice to rice shops, stating, "We hereby inform you that each rice shop selling rationed rice should submit a list of the quantity sold in the previous week every Monday, along with the rice purchase certificates collected, as notified in the letter of June 20th. However, we have found that some rice shops have not complied with the above regulations, which is deeply regrettable. Therefore, we are issuing this reminder. Those who do not comply with the above regulations will be in violation of the contract signed with this Bureau, and their license will be suspended, or a fine of 200 to 600 yuan will be imposed for the first offense, depending on the number of days the list and other documents are delayed."

(2) The refund locations are the Shanghai Branch of the Bank of China at 702 Jing'an Temple Road and the Shanghai Branch of the Farmers Bank of China at 984 Avenue Haig. (3) The refund date is from July 24th, from 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM. (4) Deposits of 5,000 yuan or more must be proven to be non-enemy-related before they can be withdrawn.

Holders of red-stamped epidemic prevention certificates must be revaccinated.

### Mr. Ding Fubao's Birthday Celebration: Public Congratulation Arrangements - Supporting Mr. Ding's Consistent Advocacy - Birthday Gifts All Allocated to Social Welfare Undertakings

This year marks the 50th anniversary of Mr. Ding Fubao's writing career and on August 3rd, it coincides with Mr. Ding's 69th birthday. His friends, including Mr. Tang Wenzhi, Xu Qianlin, Shen Enfu, Hu Puan, Wen Lanting, Jiang Zhuzhuang, Lin Kanghou, Yuan Lvdeng, and others, wanted to offer Mr. Ding a toast. However, considering that Mr. Ding has never celebrated his birthday in his life and should not be influenced by worldly customs, they have specially decided on commemorative arrangements. The announcement is recorded as follows: "August 3rd is Mr. Ding Fubao's 69th birthday. Colleagues are well aware that Mr. Ding has never celebrated his birthday. In these difficult times, we should uphold his advocacy and set an example for the world. Considering Mr. Ding's dedication to writing, admired by the world, and his years of commitment to relief efforts, characterized by compassion, it is truly impossible not to commemorate his 70th year. Therefore, we specially initiate a public celebration. To implement Mr. Ding's advocacy of not celebrating birthdays, the following commemorative arrangements are specifically made: (1) No birthday celebrations, (2) No sending invitations, (3) No banquets, (4) Mr. Ding has been most devoted to supporting young people and educating orphans and children in recent years. All monetary gifts from those who admire Mr. Ding and participate in the public celebration should be in cash, to be fully donated to the Shen Bao Readers' Scholarship Fund and the Shanghai Fuyou Orphanage, thereby expanding Mr. Ding's aspirations and bringing blessings to everyone. (5) All participants in the public celebration will receive a copy of Mr. Ding's book, 'How to Create My Healthy Life.' This book is a commemoration of Mr. Ding's 50-year writing life, detailing his medical, literary, and Buddhist works, as well as all methods of health preservation and longevity. In the commemoration of Mr. Ding not celebrating his birthday, obtaining this commemorative item can also assist everyone in pursuing health and longevity, which perhaps does not contradict Mr. Ding's intention of 'self-longevity and longevity for others.' The Shen Bao office is the place to collect monetary gifts."

### British Consul Gibson and Eleven Others Arrive in Shanghai from Nanjing - Departing Shanghai Next Month on the Repatriation Ship

The English "China Press" reported that according to the daughter of Mr. Masaki, the Japanese interpreter-general, Mr. Gibson, the British Consul in Nanjing, and his party of eleven people are expected to arrive here today (the 23rd) at 2:30 PM. The eleven people also include Vice Consul Smith and the two wives of the consular officials. The other seven people are Mr. Shaw, the manager of the International Trading Company, and Mr. Barrass, an engineer of the company; Mr. Shi Shu, the manager of Nanjing Cheng Song Co., Ltd.; Mr. Wilkinson, the manager of Nanjing Asiatic Petroleum Company; as well as the wife of the former Nanjing Postmaster, who had already arrived in Shanghai when the reporter filed the article, and her two children, a girl of ten and a boy of four.

Foreign Residents Arriving in Shanghai in Batches from Other Areas

The eleven were originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai last week, but were delayed because the British Consul and Vice Consul were handling transfer matters at the Swedish Consulate. They will travel to Lourenço Marques on the *Tatsuta Maru* or the *Ryokuyo Maru*. It is expected that most of the foreign residents from other ports and inland areas will arrive here during the final period. According to Mr. Masaki, among these people is a village group from Yingzhou, Zhejiang, including seven or eight foreign residents.

The Scheduled Number May Change

The repatriation list was still being prepared yesterday morning. Apart from the British nationals to be repatriated and the nationals of other European countries that declared war on Japan after the Pacific War, totaling about 1,800 people, nothing else is known. However, in any case, the residents selected for repatriation from other ports will be more than the foreign residents in Shanghai. The *Tatsuta Maru* will arrive here on August 1st and leave Shanghai on the 3rd. It is also learned that the *Ryokuyo Maru* will set sail on August 14th and depart for Lourenço Marques on the 16th. Each of these two postal ships can carry about 900 passengers, so it only applies under the current list plan. But many believe that the scheduled number may change, just like the previous repatriation of American nationals.

### Issuance of Identity Cards in the French Concession Temporarily Suspended - Too Busy with Rice Rationing - Re-issuance to Resume from August 1st

Since the issuance of resident identity cards for citizens in the French Concession began on the 1st of this month, issued by the Baojia offices of the Central, Avenue Joffre, Avenue Pétain, Avenue Foch, and Xiaodongmen districts, a considerable number have been issued. It is now learned that the police stations in each district responsible for issuing the certificates, due to the issuance of rice ration coupons for August starting on the 20th of this month, are too busy and the issuance of identity cards has been temporarily suspended from that day. It will resume on August 1st after the results of the verification of rice ration coupons at the end of this month.

### French General Association Refuses Allied Nationals Membership

Shanghai's "North-China Daily News" reported that yesterday (the 23rd), it was heard from the management of the French Ball Game General Association that the association has decided to refuse nationals of Britain, the United States, and other countries that have severed diplomatic relations with Japan as members. This decision has been implemented since July 15th to seek closer cooperation between Japan and France. It is heard that the association has not asked former British and American members to withdraw, but a few of them told reporters yesterday that they will withdraw voluntarily. The French General Association is located in a residential area and has long been a social center for British and American nationals. Although it is named French, the membership is international, with British, American, and Russian members being the majority. The association's lawn is neatly arranged, converted into a tennis court in summer, and has the largest indoor swimming pool in the city for members to swim.

### Municipal Council to Increase Plainclothes Chinese Detectives - Total of Ninety-Nine Additional Detectives Assigned to Various Police Stations

The "North-China Daily News" reports that on the 22nd, it was learned from officials that the Municipal Council has newly assigned ninety-nine Chinese as plainclothes detectives to strengthen the Chinese detective force, in order to more effectively combat minor crimes within the Public Concession. It is heard that these individuals are all uniformed patrolmen belonging to various police stations in the Public Concession. According to a police officer, the current assignment of new detectives is not a sign of further changes in the police force, as this happens annually. However, in order to eliminate the lower-level social activities in the Public Concession, the police force has assigned more new detectives this year than in previous years. It is heard that ten of the new detectives have been added to the Chinese Detective Division of the Central Police Station, eleven have been transferred to the Louza Police Station, eight each have been transferred to the Sinza, Hongkew, and Yangtszepoo Police Stations, six each have been transferred to the Jingansi and Wayside Police Stations, another forty have been transferred to the Criminal Division of the Fuzhou Road Police Headquarters, seven have been transferred to the Political Division, and five each have been transferred to the new Chinese Detective Divisions of the Gordon Road, Putuo Road, Jiaxing Road, Dixwell Road, Yangtszepoo, and Yulin Road Police Stations.

### Pimping and Robbery of Hostess's Clothes - Accomplices Continued to Be Apprehended

Lu Xuemei, a hostess from the Meilongzhen Guide Agency, responded to a call at room 132 of the New World Hotel on the night of the 3rd of last month. Unexpectedly, the lodgers in that room were members of a criminal gang. Seeing that Miss Lu was wearing jewelry, they revealed their ferocious faces, threatened her with knives, and intended to rob her. Miss Lu resisted, causing her arm to be injured. She then shouted for help, and a waiter, hearing the alarm, immediately arrested the perpetrator Yan Renfa on the spot and interrogated him for punishment. Now, Chinese Detective Ni Runsheng of the Chengdu Road Police Station has continued to apprehend the accomplices Li Afu and Chen Ji, bringing them into the police station. In addition to confirming their involvement in the above case, it was also learned that these people have committed many crimes in the concession. For example, Wang Hehua, a hostess from the Huangong Guide Agency, was swindled out of a watch worth 500 yuan at room 439 of the Wugong Hotel on Fujian Road on May 26th; Wang Lizhu, a hostess from the Guangming Guide Agency, was swindled out of a coat at room 133 of the Xin Travel Agency on Jiujiang Road on May 28th; Yin Huahua, the top hostess from the Taotao Guide Agency, was swindled out of clothes worth 550 yuan at room 12 of the Huangong Hotel on Zhejiang Road on May 30th, etc., all of which were committed by Li and others. There are other serious cases that cannot be investigated in detail at this time, so they have been ordered to be detained for further processing.

### Celebrating the Birthday of Mr. Ding Fubao (1)

Mr. Ding Fubao's venerable age and great virtue are admired by the world. In recent years, he has devoted himself to cultivating students and benefiting young children, which is worthy of emulation by future generations. Mr. Ding has never celebrated his birthday in his life. Now, Mr. Tang Weizhi and others believe that it is truly impossible not to commemorate Mr. Ding's 70th year, so they initiated a public celebration, which embodies Mr. Ding's intention of helping the world and extending longevity to others. This reporter believes that this move is sufficient to encourage degenerate customs, and thus comes. Therefore, I specially visited Mr. Ding, and he graciously received me, pointing out the various aspects of life cultivation and health protection, as well as Mr. Ding's academic experience and a glimpse of his writings. Although the description is inevitably incomplete, it is quite sufficient for people in society to learn from each other. Therefore, celebrating Mr. Ding's birthday today is also celebrating society, not just publicly congratulating Mr. Ding alone. - Editor's Note

The word "寿" (longevity/birthday) has at least two interpretations: "做寿" (celebrating a birthday) is called "祝寿" (congratulating on a birthday). There are people who simply do not need to "做寿" (celebrate a birthday), but they insist on celebrating their birthday, so they celebrate their 30th birthday, their 40th birthday, and the older they get, the more they want to celebrate their birthday, to show that they have "寿比南山" (longevity as long as the Southern Mountains) and "福如东海" (happiness as vast as the Eastern Sea), and at the same time, they want to win people over to "祝寿" (congratulate them on their birthday). There is another category of people who are not without a birthday to celebrate, nor are they without a birthday to congratulate. In other words, they might as well celebrate their birthday, and they might as well be congratulated on their birthday, but they themselves do not want to celebrate their birthday, but because there is actually a birthday to celebrate, they cannot force people not to congratulate them on their birthday. In order to comply with the principle of "自寿寿人" (self-longevity and longevity for others), so that more people in need can obtain practical benefits, they express the birthday celebration in another better and more noble form. If the difference between these two typical types cannot be mistaken, then Mr. Ding Fubao should belong to the latter.

Birthday Gifts Donated to Social Welfare Undertakings

This year is the 50th anniversary of Mr. Ding Fubao's writing life, and next month on the 3rd is his 69th birthday. According to his morality and articles, he is admired by the world, and in recent years, he has been doing his best to promote charitable undertakings, which is what the public expects and society praises. When this "life of seventy is rare since ancient times" comes, there must be something to commemorate. However, he has never celebrated his birthday in his life and cannot be influenced by worldly customs. Therefore, after the design of his relatives and friends, it was decided that under the three major principles of not celebrating birthdays, not sending invitations, and not holding banquets, all cash birthday gifts will be transferred to the Shanghai Fuyou Orphanage and the Shen Bao Readers' Scholarship Fund. Behind such a respected figure, there must be a series of exemplary deeds and unwavering beliefs that can serve as a model for the world. Like an explorer, with a curious and seeking heart, the reporter decided to visit Mr. Ding Fubao, whose great name has long been heard but has not yet been met.

In a fine room surrounded by bookshelves, sat a kind old man with a refined spirit overflowing between his eyebrows. Although he is already nearing his 70th year, his face is still full of radiance, and his spirit is vigorous, adorned with a sparse, mottled white beard under his chin. He sat serenely in a circular chair, waving an elegant folding fan in his right hand, gesturing with his left hand, and talking at length to the guest. He is like a courteous and sincere scholar, more like a solemn and dignified immortal. With an attitude and conversation that is both humorous and solemn, without hiding secrets, without pride or arrogance, and with a frank and straightforward style, no matter how confused your mind is or how complex your thinking is, you will definitely sit quietly opposite him, with anticipation and interest, letting him open the conversation.

The Secret of Longevity: Tranquility First

Everyone knows that Mr. Ding is an authority on longevity methods, and he is most willing to tell people about his own experience in longevity. So before I could settle down, he said with a smile, "I want to talk about the secrets of longevity. People who are weak can become strong, and focusing on longevity and health can be grasped. The way of decay can lead to longevity."

According to the experience of this "Longevity Elder," the first secret of longevity is tranquility: physical tranquility and mental tranquility. The second is to do deep breathing. This is a very effective method for preventing lung disease. It can be done three times a day, morning, noon, and dusk, each time about forty times. He himself even runs outdoors in the middle of the night to stand upright and do deep breathing. He said that if you get used to doing this, you can avoid coughing, spitting phlegm, and asthma for a lifetime. In addition, sufficient sunlight helps to maintain health. He approves of air baths and sunbaths, and even in the cold of winter, he has to take off his shirt to enjoy the grace of natural sunlight.

Dietary hygiene has a very close relationship with the length of life. Food is not about quantity, but about quality, the most important thing being the even distribution of nutrients. Although these things are simply out of the question for some people, Mr. Ding's views are still worth referring to for those who want to maintain longevity. He believes that what should not be missing from the daily diet is half a pound of milk, two half-cooked eggs, three tablespoons of soybean powder, three tomatoes, white radish juice (the nutrients in one white radish can be worth four Florida tangerines), three bananas, vegetables, and white porridge and white rice, etc. In order to ensure health, things like tobacco and alcohol should be banned.

### Deadline for Storing Imported Goods in Customs Warehouses Extended to the End of September

The General Affairs Section of the Jianghai Customs issued Notice No. 132 yesterday regarding the extension of the deadline for storing imported goods in customs warehouses: "It has been found that the regulations of the Ordinary Customs Warehouse stipulate a time limit for storing imported goods in customs warehouses.

### Shanghai Branches of the Central Reserve Bank Establish Defaced Banknote Exchange Offices

The Shanghai branch of the Central Reserve Bank, in view of the fact that Central Reserve Bank notes circulating in the market are often rejected for acceptance if they are slightly damaged or torn, has specially formulated and announced the implementation of measures for exchanging defaced banknotes. After the Joint Committee of the Silver and Money Trade Association received the letter, it officially notified all member banks and firms that they must not be picky or arrogant in their behavior. Therefore, recently, there have been no cases of merchants or civilians rejecting the use of defaced banknotes. It is now learned that in order to facilitate the exchange of defaced banknotes for citizens in remote areas, the Shanghai branch of the Central Reserve Bank has specially set up defaced banknote exchange offices in the West Shanghai Office and the French Concession Office to facilitate the exchange.

### A Loose Woman's Quadrangular Love Affair - Indian Constable Strangled to Death - For Money or Out of Jealousy?

The 40-year-old Indian constable Wintesing, a watchman at the Municipal Council Waterworks Plant at 267 Ningguo Road, had been having an affair with Hu Shen, a 23-year-old loose woman from Yangzhou, for two years. They often met in the plant's workshop, and the Indian constable gave her dozens of yuan a month. Mrs. Hu's husband, Hu A'er, works as a laborer at the Shenxin No. 6 Factory. His income is not enough to cover expenses, so he allows his wife to do as she pleases and does not interfere. Unexpectedly, Mrs. Hu recently had an affair with Zhou Baoqing, a fellow villager who works as a waiter at the Tianxin Yangzhou Theater at 40 Songpan Road. They rented a small house at 41 Songxingli on the same road and have been living together for about two months, as if they were husband and wife. Mr. Hu A'er, her husband, has ignored everything. From then on, Mrs. Hu Shen, a woman with three husbands, has a loose reputation in the Yangshupu area. Unexpectedly, the Indian constable Wintesing was strangled to death in his bedroom with a red cloth used to tie his head at midnight on the 18th of this month. His boxes and chests were opened, overturned, and messy, and all his belongings were gone. It was not until the next morning that a friend of the deceased, the Indian Baidaxing, went to another place to withdraw 250 yuan in legal tender that he discovered the incident and was greatly shocked. He reported the situation to the Yangshupu Police Station, which sent Detective Ji Xiucheng to investigate. Hu Shen and her lover Zhou Baoqing are highly suspected, either for money or out of jealousy, of harming him. Yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM, they secretly went to the original address and brought her and Zhou into the police station together, escorting them for investigation to ascertain the truth.

Yesterday, Mr. Lu Shoulun of the Lun Society handed over the first scholarship donation of 5,000 yuan in Central Reserve Bank notes for this year. Upon receiving it, we would like to express our gratitude on behalf of the poor and needy students. The letter from the Lun Society is recorded as follows: "Since your newspaper has been running the scholarship fund, the summers and winters have changed many times, and you have always persevered, benefiting the people, which is very admirable. In this time of rising prices and difficult livelihoods, poor and needy students have no way to raise funds, resulting in many dropouts. Since your newspaper has initiated the scholarship fund in the past, my colleagues should make an effort to donate and fulfill our responsibility of mutual assistance. We have entrusted Mr. Lu Shoulun, a member of our society, to first present the first batch of donations collected by our society for your newspaper's scholarship fund, totaling 5,000 yuan in Central Reserve Bank notes. We hope that you will accept it. My colleagues secretly wish to continue to contribute our modest efforts and continue to donate and collect the full amount in the near future. We hope that you will understand. Respectfully, The Lun Society, July 22nd."

The Master of Kuzhai Is Eager to Do Good

"I am from Ningbo and have always been a paper merchant, and also one of the directors of a paper mill. Two months ago, when the factory was sold, I was given 30,000 yuan in Central Reserve Bank notes as director's remuneration. I thought to myself that I had no significant contribution to the factory and did not want to accept it. I declined repeatedly, but in the end, I reluctantly accepted it because of the factory authorities' sincere intentions. It would be disrespectful to refuse it, and I would be even more ashamed to accept it. Therefore, I donated the above-mentioned remuneration of 30,000 yuan entirely to good deeds. I also received generous and righteous assistance from Mr. Zhang, the chairman of the factory, who added 10,000 yuan in Central Reserve Bank notes, totaling 40,000 yuan. In addition to the 10,000 yuan donated separately to the St. Francis Xavier Scholarship Fund on the 15th of this month, and the 25,000 yuan sent to the Shanghai Epidemic Hospital, Children's Hospital, Tongren Fuyuan Hall, National Medicine Civilian Hospital, Sze Ming Orphanage, Qinghan Loan Fund of Fuchun Primary School, Qinghan Loan Fund of Xicheng Primary School, Difficult Children's Education and Care Center, Xinwen Bao Scholarship Fund, and Xinwen Bao Small Capital Loan Fund, I respectfully offer 5,000 yuan as a donation to the Shen Bao Scholarship Fund. The above totals 40,000 yuan. Furthermore, Shanghai is a gathering place for industry and commerce. In recent years, prices have soared, and most companies and factories have been able to make profits. I have been in business for 30 years and have experienced many hardships. I am usually diligent and self-disciplined, but my family is not from a wealthy background. Therefore, this time, when a paper mill was sold, I had an unexpected result. I will allocate the remuneration I received in full to public welfare. I secretly think that most of the gentlemen who serve as directors and supervisors in our industrial and commercial circles are high-ranking and are definitely not just relying on remuneration to make a living. Therefore, in addition to doing my best for society and promoting it, I would like to appeal to the gentlemen who serve as directors and supervisors in our industrial and commercial circles, or to allocate a part or all of the remuneration and transportation fees they receive to public welfare, benefiting the people, which is not a small matter and is easy to do. I hope that the gentlemen will be happy to follow suit. Master of Kuzhai, July 21st."

Yesterday's Scholarship Collection Broke Records

The scholarship funds received yesterday are recorded as follows: Lun Society 5,000 yuan, Master of Kuzhai 5,000 yuan, Zhu Jiabin 500 yuan, Dai Jiji 100 yuan, Hua Ziqiang 50 yuan, totaling 10,650 yuan in Central Reserve Bank notes. Previous balance 68,945.54 yuan, total balance 79,595.54 yuan

The scope of application for this year is the same as the previous two years, namely the university group, the middle school group, the primary school group (limited to grades 5 and 6), and the industrial and commercial employee group.

### True Cholera Cases Continue to Be Discovered - A Boy Dies of the Epidemic

The weather is hot and humid, and the seasonal diseases are prevalent. In order to prevent the spread of cholera, the authorities are conducting second injections of vaccines for prevention. According to the Shanghai Emergency Epidemic Hospital Second Hospital on Daxi Road, the number of patients with seasonal diseases who come for treatment has been endless in recent days, resulting in the hospital's staff being insufficient. Now, many nurses have been hired to work in two shifts, day and night. Because most of the patients in the hospital need to be injected with physiological saline, with some needing more than 20 tubes, which takes three or four hours. According to the inspection report, three people were found to have true cholera: Lin Fengming, an 11-year-old boy living at 19, Lane 684, Haig Road; Cao Zhou, a 25-year-old woman living at 1 Lincoln Road; and Qiu Qiming, a 23-year-old man living at 30 Yuyuan Road. Lin Fengming could not be saved, and the others are being treated with all their strength. Their progress is good. More than 20 other patients are still under examination. The hospital is hosted by the Shanghai New Pharmaceutical Industry Association and is responsible for medical affairs by Dr. Tong Zhiqing, a medical doctor from the University of Heidelberg in Germany. Other doctors and nurses are graduates of famous medical universities at home and abroad. Patients who come for treatment do not have to pay any fees, and those who are truly poor and sick can go to the hospital for treatment. The hospital has had many cholera patients in recent days, and the cost of medicine has been very high. It is hoped that all sectors of society will rise up to assist. Telephone number: 22395. Address: 47A Daxi Road.

### Bao Pei Returns to Shanghai, Discusses the Indian Independence Movement, Previously Attended a Conference in Bangkok

According to the Allied News Agency, Mr. Bao Pei, President of the Indian League in Shanghai, previously traveled from Shanghai to Thailand to attend a conference of the Indian Independence League General Assembly and the Independence League Committee. Having completed his official duties, he recently returned to Shanghai via Saigon and Guangzhou. He discussed the development of the Indian independence movement in various parts of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, as follows:

"I, in order to attend the Indian Independence League General Assembly, departed from Shanghai on June 1st, along with Mr. Pei Xin and Mr. Du Xi. On the morning of the 14th, we arrived in Saigon, where we heard that the General Assembly had been moved forward from the 18th to the 15th. Therefore, on the 15th, we, along with the representatives from Java, flew to Bangkok. More than 120 representatives from Burma, Saigon, Batavia, Malaya, Hong Kong, Manila, China, and other places participated in the conference. At that time, I made every effort to explain Japan's true intentions to the representatives who had lived far away for a long time and lacked the opportunity to contact Japan. The conference did not fully conclude until the 27th. At that time, Thai Prime Minister Pibulsonggram specially hosted a banquet to welcome the representatives and provided various conveniences. Japanese Prime Minister Tojo also sent a congratulatory telegram to express his support for the General Assembly. I am extremely grateful for the kindness shown in various aspects. After the conference concluded, I traveled by train from Bangkok to Saigon on the 28th. Along the way, I saw Japanese sentries at each station, wearing mosquito nets on their faces in the hot weather, guarding the railway. I was greatly moved and even shed tears. The residents of Saigon also respected the Japanese soldiers guarding the area. At the same time, thinking of India, which is currently under tyranny, I felt the necessity of achieving independence as soon as possible. After traveling and inspecting for more than a month and a half, I realized that wherever the Japanese army went, they maintained strict military discipline and treated the general public very kindly. At the same time, under the protection of the Japanese army, the residents were working hard to build a new East Asia. Britain has always used threats as its only means to deceive the Indian people. In order to respond to the independence movement in India, we pledge to work with China and Japan to build a new East Asia with all our strength, so that this movement can be completed as soon as possible and save 350 million compatriots from fire and water."

### Fried Rice (1) - A Sketch of a Restaurant Worker's Life -

— Da Jun

As soon as I wrote the title, I immediately felt it was difficult. Originally, when talking about a certain industry, the history of that industry is indispensable. For example, when talking about the carpentry industry, one should talk about Lu Ban, and when talking about the tofu industry, one should talk about what old lady of some prince couldn't chew soybeans, etc. However, regarding the history of the "fried rice industry," I don't know anything at all. People who are good at textual research can write "to be determined" on it. My father is someone who is not good at textual research, what should I do?

However, I don't have any ambitions in writing this article. I don't want to criticize the ways of the world, nor do I want to contribute to knowledge and academics. I'm just familiar with a few people who eat "fried rice," I know them, I understand them, and I find them very cute. Therefore, I have developed a strong interest in their lives and can't help but want to write about them. Even though I know I don't know much, I don't care.

This "fried rice" name is not unfamiliar to readers, right? Wherever you go on the street, you can always see large or small restaurants and hotels. The large restaurants are full of people, and the small restaurants are also full of people. So you nod and sigh: "Ah, Shanghai is so prosperous!" But please don't forget that no matter what restaurant or hotel, it can't operate without people who eat "fried rice" to "make a living" there.

Speaking of "making a living," people who eat "fried rice" will pull up their greasy apron, wipe the sweat from their noses, and say: "It's hard!"

Indeed, it is hard. Think about it: on hot days, the guests sit and eat comfortably in elegant seats with electric fans on, but they are making a living between dozens of red, flame-spewing stove holes. The heat forces their faces to turn red and their veins to bulge. Oily sweat flows from their heads to their feet. Large and small iron pots are placed on each stove hole, letting the flames lick them, "hissing, hissing, hissing" and moaning. Occasionally, with a "pa!", a spoonful of oil enters the pot, and something inside "bibi bo" starts to tell about the suffering of being fried in the fire. The smell of oil, the smell of blood, the smell of various dishes, the smell of coal... mixed in the dirty, irritable air, it can make people feel suffocated and dizzy, and they work in the middle of it from dawn to late at night.

But there are also different levels and types of hardship. The workers are not all hired hands. There are bosses and apprentices. The boss does the easiest work and gets the most money. The hired hands are second, and the apprentices are the hardest, doing the most laborious work and getting the least money.

All the bosses who come down to the floor to work are not necessarily rich. They are generally just promoted from the position of a hired hand to a boss. On the one hand, they are somewhat nostalgic for the work they have been doing for many years, and on the other hand, they actually want to gain some profit. This profit is in addition to the profit of opening a store. The boss goes to the vegetable market to buy goods early in the morning, fearing that if he sends someone else, they will be taken advantage of. When the hired hands are working, he helps here and there, gives instructions, and scolds a bit, so the hired hands are not able to be lazy. In addition, when dividing small accounts, the boss has a large share.

The hired hands are the legitimate "fried rice eaters." Restaurants and hotels also have different natures. Some specialize in large banquets, some specialize in snacks, some specialize in dim sum, and some have two or three of these. If there are all three types, then the hired hands are also divided into high and low. If the hired hand has great cooking skills and can cook a whole table of dishes, he will be particularly valued by the boss. His work will be light, and his reward will be great. He often doesn't have to work at the stove himself, just telling how a certain dish should be made, giving instructions. His position is equivalent to the so-called "Ah Da" of a store, with the power to hit and scold people. They have a very funny name for themselves, called "Number One Coal Stove." The hired hands with slightly less skills, who can only cook scattered stir-fries, are ranked as "Number Two Coal Stove." They have more work and less reward. The next one is "Number Three Coal Stove," who has just left the apprenticeship stage and can only fry pork chops, puff up pork skin, and cook soup noodles and fried cakes. The treatment is naturally worse.

The boss is not happy and scolds the hired hands; the hired hands are bored and take it out on the apprentices; and the apprentices dare not resist. Needless to say, it's hard. In the morning, they have to get up one or two hours earlier than the hired hands. Several coal stoves have to be lit. Then they clean up, and when the boss brings the vegetables, they cut fish and wash meat. At this time, they are not busy, as long as they try to please, it's okay. When it gets busy, it's a disaster. Usually, there are not many apprentices, at most two or three, while there are dozens of hired hands. With two or three people responding to dozens, it's impossible to be attentive. "Little devil, bring a plate of shredded pork!" "Little ball bag, bring a bottle of soy sauce!" "Damn you, the oil is boiling..." These kinds of calls are everywhere. If you take care of this and are one step late there, you will get a chestnut knock on your head. During the day, at most, you can eat twenty or thirty chestnut knocks. From five o'clock in the morning until two o'clock in the afternoon, you can have lunch. After lunch, you can take a nap for one or two hours, and then you will be busy again, until nine o'clock in the evening, when you have dinner. After dinner, the hired hands are off work, but the apprentices still have things to do. They have to put out the coal stoves, take out the coal, and pick out the coal slag for reuse. In addition, a large pile of dishes have to be washed, tables have to be wiped, and the floor has to be swept. At least it takes until after eleven o'clock to go to sleep, dazed. Apprentices have no salary, only a few dollars for bathing and haircuts. They can also get some small accounts, but very little, only one-tenth of the "Number One Coal Stove." For example, usually a "Number One Coal Stove" can get two or three hundred yuan a month, then an apprentice can only get twenty or thirty yuan.

Zi Guang Sunglasses Lately, the weather has been hot, and sunglasses have become extremely popular. However, buying sunglasses requires considerable experience. Most of the glass sold on the market is made of poured pieces (i.e., lenses that have not been polished), with uneven light intensity, which is very harmful. It is said that the sunglasses produced by the Zi Guang Optical Factory at 136 Park Road have lenses that have been finely polished, and the styles are also beautiful. Moreover, the factory sells directly to customers, without being exploited by a second party, so the price is cheap.

### Public Utility Charges to be Reduced by 15%

According to the Allied News Agency on the 23rd of this month in this city, public utilities, including water, electricity, and gas, will reduce the charge rate by 15%. This is because the relevant authorities have decided to reduce the price of coal supplied to the Shanghai Power Company by 14 yuan per ton. Among them, the Shanghai Gas Company will not immediately reduce its fees due to its current financial situation.

### Tight Credit Makes it Difficult to Invest in Chinese Stocks

Yesterday, the Chinese stock market softened again, mainly due to tight credit. Investors had the will but not the means, which is a pity. The rumor that Dasheng No. 3 Factory would return capital was still strong, and the price rose again to a high of 230 yuan, ultimately rising by 10 yuan. Among department stores, Daxin Company alone rose by 5 yuan. Although Yong'an and Xinxin did not make progress, the future looks promising. Intimate apparel stocks were flat and weak. Wu Hai Woolen rebounded by a small amount of 5 jiao and insisted on staying above the 20 yuan mark. There was no shortage of buyers at the limit price. Cultural stocks had a significant decline. Commercial Press broke the 300 yuan mark, Zhonghua entered the 200 yuan range, and Shijie fell by 2.5 yuan. Both Zhabei Water and Electricity and China General Edison rose, while the latter fell, each by 5 jiao. Among new pharmaceutical stocks, Minyi was weak, while the rest turned firm. Zhongfa rose to the 80 yuan mark, and Xinya rose by 5 jiao. Nanyang Tobacco fell again by 2.5 yuan, entering the 80 yuan range, and was the only one to slump. Shengsheng Art and Dahua are still in a weak state. Trading was not lonely, and people's hearts were stable. The market prices of each stock are recorded below:

### Five Things That Should Not Be Done in Speculation

According to a survey report by the Xu Shi Industrial and Commercial Service Center, when the speculation craze in Shanghai was at its peak last summer, there were more than 1,300 yarn firms selling short and buying long. Setting up a few telephones, co-renting half an office, or placing a desk could form a yarn firm or silver firm. It seemed like a flowery brocade, very prosperous. If one observes it with a long-term vision, there are indeed five things that should not be done.

(1) Eradicating the Inferior National Character: The inferior national character of the Chinese people is to gamble on luck. Everyone wants to gain without labor and is unwilling to work hard. Everyone wants to make money, and if they have money, they are "tycoons." They should know that money should come from their own sweat and blood to be valuable! Most speculators, if they speculate successfully, make money easily and spend lavishly. If they don't speculate successfully, they cry out in despair! The Huangpu River has seen many promising young people lose their lives in this way, and it has reinforced the inferior national character of Chinese people who gamble on luck and want to get rich without labor. Therefore, Chinese people rarely create and build. Suppressing speculation means eradicating the inferior national character.

(2) Idle Funds Can Have Legitimate Uses: The legitimate use of idle funds is to increase social production. Humans need resources for survival, which are produced mutually. When production and consumption are balanced, the problem of people's livelihood is naturally solved. What production can be said to be involved in the speculative market, where people sell short and buy long? Using capital for production or social welfare is a legitimate use. Suppressing the speculative market means directing idle funds to legitimate uses.

(3) Avoiding Wasted Time and Enabling People to Seek Legitimate Work: Chinese people's time is the least valuable (?). People only live for about 20 years of their 60-year life. Smoking, drinking tea, chatting idly, gambling… have always been the only ways for Chinese people to kill time. The speculative market is a casino, the manager of the speculative market is the owner of the casino, the staff are the male and female attendants of the casino, and the customers are the gamblers. When the speculative market in Shanghai was at its peak, how many people were well-fed and well-clothed, doing nothing, wasting time listening to telephones, reporting market conditions, selling short and buying long? Is this the work of life? Suppressing the speculative market is to prevent people from wasting time and enable them to seek legitimate work.

(4) Curbing Prices: With idle funds, a large amount of idle funds, one can do business. In the past, speculators, gentlemen, ladies, and grannies, speculators concentrated capital and further hoarded goods. During the war, the source of goods was not smooth, there were few producers, many consumers, and they also encountered "hoarding tigers, hoarding monkeys, hoarding dogs, hoarding cats," how could the price not rise? Suppressing the speculative market is the key to suppressing price increases.

(5) Saving Resources: How much is spent in the speculative market, such as electricity, fans, electric stoves, telephones, etc.? Now, legitimate production factories have limited electricity bills. Is it not good to save the electricity consumed by the speculative market and transfer it to other uses? As for the houses rented by the speculative market, all equipment, and other paper and ink consumption, how much is that? Suppressing the speculative market is to save resources.

Xu Shi Industrial and Commercial Service Center was established in the autumn of the 29th year of the Republic of China. It is a private organization that handles sporadic work in the industrial and commercial circles. It has long conducted investigations on the speculative market and has the "National Financial Market Investigation Record" edited by Xu Wancheng, which contains a wide range of content and can be seen at a glance. It can clarify the evolution of the Chinese financial industry. This book is published by Longwen Bookstore and is currently being printed. It will be published at the end of this month.

### Gold Ornaments and Silver Stand Still

Yesterday, the price of gold ornaments and silver sold by the New Line gold shop in this city remained unchanged at 2,250 yuan per tael (350 yuan less for purchases). The inter-industry trading price was low first and then rebounded. Initially, it was 1,920 yuan per tael, and the lowest was 1,910 yuan. Buyers were seen at low prices, and it immediately rebounded. At noon, there were few offers for 1,950 yuan, a gain of 200 yuan compared to the previous day, with a difference of 400 yuan. Transactions were sparse. In the afternoon, it was 1,960 yuan. The price of gold ornaments and silver sold for 16 yuan per tael, unchanged. The inter-industry trading price was 11.67 yuan.

### Call Loan Rate Still at 2 Jiao

Yesterday, the interbank call loan rate of the Qianye Guild remained at 2 jiao. The tightening of credit is due to the banking industry raising interest rates to attract funds and prevent them from being used by speculators. The discount rate for new remittance bills was flat. Yesterday, the inter-industry trading price for military tickets was still 5.5 yuan, with a bid-ask spread of 7-8 li. The over-the-counter price was 5.4 jiao and 5.5 jiao.

### Slack Trade in Coarse Grains

Yesterday, the number of people visiting the coarse grains market decreased sharply, so the trade was quite quiet. The Tong Market only opened for the sale of 500 pieces of new Kai Li Zi soybean cake for May, priced at 69 yuan. 500 pieces of Xing Ji soybean cake for April, Yoshida Wharf bill of lading, were priced at 69 yuan. The market was slightly bullish, with little remaining transaction.

The supply and demand for bran were both scarce. Cargo owners continued to hold firm in their intention to sell, and the price rose by about 1 yuan again. It is estimated that 200 small bags of Sanxin bran, May wharf bill of lading, were priced at 97 yuan.

### Ningbo Dried Cuttlefish Has Not Arrived

Due to the small amount of Ningbo dried cuttlefish produced this year, the new goods have not yet arrived in Shanghai, and the old goods are also very scarce, resulting in firm prices with very few signs of easing. Yesterday, the market price for Zhoushan goods was 500 yuan, Ningbo dried cuttlefish was 450 yuan, and Yantai goods were 600 yuan.

### Sprout of Chinese Toon Soars Due to Scarcity

Sprout of Chinese toon is a wonderful seasonal delicacy. Recently, the production price has been difficult to determine, and there has been no continuous replenishment, leading to a firm market trend. Currently, the higher prices at the market range around four hundred yuan per bundle, followed by three hundred eighty yuan to three hundred sixty yuan. Transactions in this street are the most active.

### U-nails Return to Seven Hundred Yuan

Due to the shortage of raw materials, the production of U-nails from our factory has been scarce. The standard "倍司" (a unit of weight) was once priced as high as seven hundred fifty yuan. However, recently, due to hoarders rushing to release their stocks at high prices, the market has shown an imbalance between supply and demand. People's sentiment softened for a while, and the price of standard "倍司" per barrel returned from seven hundred fifty yuan to seven hundred yuan. Moreover, actual sales remain sluggish, and there are still many sellers.

### Ribbed Steel Bars - Actual Sales Still Stagnant

Sales of forty-foot ribbed steel bars are slow because the construction industry in this city has plummeted, and the "客幫" (contractor groups) have also stopped accepting goods. Therefore, the confidence of the industry is also difficult to see strengthened. Standard market trends are weak. For example, forty-foot, three- and four-point colored ones are selling for ten thousand five hundred yuan per ton. Five-point to one-inch goods are priced at ten thousand yuan per ton. Three-foot starter goods are priced at seven thousand yuan per ton.

Spring and Autumn

### Diary of a Private Tutor II
— Wang Mingwei

If you are accustomed to the life of chalk dust, then spending this long summer vacation as a private tutor is the most suitable thing to do. It can save you a lot of unnecessary expenses during leisure time, and it will prevent your spirit from feeling dull and monotonous. At the end of the term, you can also get some travel expenses for drinks or theater. If you are even luckier and can find a family that respects teachers, it will make you feel refreshed and realize the purity and prestige of the teacher's position. Although many people in society regard teachers as "teaching artisans" and "those who sit on the cold bench," there is no such phenomenon here. You will be so respected by them that you will feel uneasy. From this, it can be seen that our country's custom of respecting teachers has not been completely extinguished.

However, it must be said that how much people treat you well depends on your ability. If you want to try the method of Mr. Nanguo, you are guaranteed to fail and have to run away, unless the master of that family is the foolish King Xuan of Qi, otherwise, who wants you to occupy a position without doing any work?

One of the biggest turning points between school and home education is that someone proficient in school teaching methods may not be qualified for home education. Knowledge, experience, and psychology are all the qualifications of a teacher. Lacking one of them will make you feel ineffective. However, home teaching places more emphasis on the latter. Furthermore, you must have the ability to assimilate, which means that when you discover the personality and temperament of each child, you can integrate your personality and words with them. In this way, you will be welcomed by any parents and children. Over time, they will regard you as an indispensable good teacher and good friend, and difficulties will no longer haunt you. At that time, no matter if the other party is a naughty, cunning, or stupid inferior student, they will be like tangled hemp meeting a knife, and they will obediently accept your teachings. The author is someone who teaches by example and is also addicted to chalk. If the chalk dust that has been worn away over the years is accumulated, its weight will definitely be no less than a loaf of bread. The following is a record of the author's recent experience as a private tutor. Because there are not many dates yet, it is titled "Two-Day Diary":

On the first day, I followed the address on the letter of introduction and found it easily. Looking from the outside, one could tell at a glance that it was a large residence. When the doorbell rang, an old porter opened the door. Before I could ask, a thirteen- or fourteen-year-old boy suddenly appeared behind the old porter. Seeing me, he didn't greet me but said straight to my face, "Are you Mr. Wang? Mom is waiting for you in the living room. Come, I'll take you there." After saying that, without waiting for my reply, he turned around and dashed forward. It turned out he was wearing a pair of ice skates on his feet. His skating skills were indeed excellent. I saw him slightly twist his legs and waist, and in a few seconds, he was already several yards away from me, forcing me to sigh in the back with the idiom "unable to catch up with his dust." After a while, the boy and his mother came out to greet me. So, we returned to the living room. Inevitably, there was some polite exchange between host and guest. Through conversation, I learned that he had a total of five children who needed tutoring: the eldest daughter, seventeen years old, was studying at a certain girls' high school on Avenue Joffre (霞飛路). She just graduated from junior high school this semester and needed tutoring in Chinese, English, and mathematics. The following three were all boys. Two were studying in junior high school, and the youngest and the fifth were still in elementary school. They also needed tutoring in the main subjects. At this time, several different heads suddenly peeked in from the window, some thin, some strong, and some with braided hair. These many little figures all had curious looks on their faces, intently sizing up this newly arrived teacher, wondering if he was fierce or kind. The shortest fifth child was also climbing in the middle of the slide, tilting his head and staring at me from outside the window. The hostess called them in one by one to perform the ritual of greeting the teacher. The sixteen-year-old second son was the most stubborn. Everyone else was very well-behaved, but he only gave me a reluctant bow of less than twenty degrees, his eyebrows still filled with the meaning of "Who wants you to come?"

The classroom was arranged in the west wing, and the layout in the middle was quite suitable: four long desks, with a teacher's seat at the head. On the long table behind the seat were a fan and two worthless antique vases, filled with red gladiolus flowers. On the right was a large natural history cabinet, I don't know where they collected so many specimens of animals, plants, and minerals. Because it was the first day, I had to talk to them first. After the talk, I felt that the levels were too different, and there were too many classes. So, I first arranged a daily schedule to try it out. When arranging the schedule, the eldest daughter wanted to add piano lessons, and the fourth child clamored to add art lessons. In the end, I couldn't bear to disappoint them and allowed them to practice after class. So, one morning passed by unnoticed.

At lunchtime, I became their teacher at the table. After the meal, everyone went to do their own activities, and I pulled the fifth child over to talk. He said, "My eldest sister loves to eat candy and ride a bicycle. The second brother has a very bad temper. He tricks people into eating things and never returns them. He likes to ask people to do what he should be doing and also likes to catch insects and fish. The third brother is his uncle's child. He's good. He likes to skate and eat Consort Gao pastries. The fourth brother is the dumbest and also cries the most, but Mom loves him the most." I asked him what he liked. He said he liked to play on the seesaw and watch speed-drawing pictures. Coincidentally, I had a few speed-drawing books from the Children's Book Bureau, so I promised to bring them to him tomorrow. He was as happy as anything. In the afternoon, the third child asked me if I could ride a bicycle. I said maybe I could be your teacher. The eldest sister heard this and asked me to accompany her to buy books by bike. The third child also wanted to join, so he pushed out a men's bike from the porter's room. But he thought it was too high. When he sat on the seat, his feet couldn't reach the ground, so he had to sway his body left and right to pedal. He looked very strenuous. Off we went! But not far from home, he fell down with the bike, scraping his leg. Blood seeped out from the wound covered with dust. But he restrained himself and said it didn't hurt. We hurried back home for treatment, and I became his only nurse. After bandaging, he refused to rest at home and insisted on using Nezha's wind-fire wheels to follow us. I couldn't force him, so I had to let him. On the road, the eldest sister praised my riding skills as very skilled and said, "If I had your skilled technique, I wouldn't be afraid of bad people on bikes." It turned out she had once been embarrassed by someone. As we passed Gujiazhai Park, because we were busy talking, when I turned my head, I couldn't see the third child. Turning back, I saw him squatting far away on the ground with a few wild children holding long bamboo poles catching cicadas. He spent two dimes to buy a cicada that would squeak even when held in his hand. When we got to the bookstore, the cicada had already taken a sweat bath in his hand and was suffocated to death.

With the new books in hand, the fourth child said the cover was ugly. The fifth child said why there were no people. After another round of you pasting covers and him snatching scissors, we finally wrapped the books. It wasn't until the sun set that I embarked on my return journey.

The next day was for the trial lesson. Stepping into the classroom, many people were crowding around the second child's seat, watching him write small characters. The third child and others were standing aside, mutually admiring. It turned out that the second child had gone to climb a tree in the backyard early in the morning and fell down, breaking a large goldfish bowl under the tree, getting himself covered in water. Fortunately, he was quick-witted and hurriedly put the goldfish one by one into the lotus pond with firewood, otherwise, if his father's beloved goldfish died, it would be terrible. So, the second child was punished by his mother to write five pages of small characters, with the deadline before 4 pm, and the grade was required to be no less than 80 points.

During class, while I was writing on the blackboard, the fourth child secretly slipped out. The third child also wanted to go out, and I agreed. After a while, the two of them came back slowly. I asked them what they were doing, and they said they were helping Afu push the newly bought lawnmower. I finally gave them each a lesson in Chinese and assigned some questions for them to do, and they finally quieted down. Then I lectured the eldest on Chinese. When I was lecturing on the passage in the Book of Rites, "When leaving the seat or standing up, the mother must participate..." the third child also stopped writing and listened quietly. Suddenly, he stood up and asked, "Teacher! Why do plants and animals have male and female sexes? And why are the children born sometimes male and sometimes female?" Good heavens! This child is really amazing. If Cao Xueqin were still alive, he would definitely invite him to be assigned to the Dream of the Red Chamber.

It was lunchtime again. A rush of wheel sounds started in the corridor. This was clearly the third child indulging in his Nezha addiction again. Suddenly, there was a "bang" sound, followed by the maid's "Oh dear!" The wheel sound stopped. Everyone knew something had happened again. Running over to take a look, I realized that Little Nezha had knocked over the soup plate in the corridor. Fortunately, the soup wasn't hot, and no one was scalded, but the third child's top was soaked in the smell of dried shrimp and pickled vegetables. When his own mother found out about this, she imitated the method of punishing the second child and also fined him a piece of Consort Gao pastry for the afternoon. The third child's eyebrows were furrowed together.

After lunch, he was riding the eldest sister's bicycle in the hot sun again, dragging a toy duck that the fifth child played with behind him, dragging the duck until it was exhausted! Quack! Quack! It kept quacking.

### On "Living and Seeking Survival"
— Shunyi

Yan Yan's article "Living and Seeking Survival" on July 21st's Spring and Autumn made me have another different opinion.

Indeed, "Why do I ride in a car while he pulls the car?" Under the current social circumstances, it cannot be said to be inhumane. On the contrary, it can be said to give him more food and is humane. Rickshaw pullers look for customers on the road every day, giving themselves the opportunity to sweat. They hope so because if there are no customers and they don't need to run, they can't live. However, the problem lies in "life is painful." The life of a rickshaw puller is indeed painful, and pulling the rickshaw is also painful; but his life should not always be bitter, and his pulling the rickshaw should not always go on. There is an "should" in it. Similarly, many people's lives are like this. On the contrary, rich and wealthy people spend their days leisurely and comfortable, living a life without any pain. Is that supposed to be the case?

Originally, a person should have the psychology of respecting and enjoying their work, but the effort and reward in current careers are often very unbalanced. Rickshaw pullers work so hard, but the labor wages they receive are very meager. Therefore, they should have the desire to strive for jobs that are lighter and more rewarding. It is a pity that they do not have this opportunity due to various restrictions. A person will always have at least a little hope for something, even if it cannot be completely successful. Therefore, rickshaw pullers must have a sense of envy for the lives of the rich and famous; but even though they envy them, they certainly still have their strong courage to survive.

I understand what Mr. Yan Yan means. It is to tell those of us who seek survival in pain not to lose the courage to survive because of the pain of life. This is certainly an absolute theorem, but there are also many people whose lives are not painful (even if there is pain, it is self-inflicted). In order to satisfy their desires, they spare no effort to pursue various things. This is not seeking survival but seeking the enjoyment of survival.

### A Quick Sketch of Entering Aurora University
— Li Guang

After the graduation ceremony, I was a high school student as usual. When I firmly grasped the hands of my beloved classmates and wished each other well, I, fortunate enough, returned home with excited steps. After reporting my school report card to my parents, I proudly took out the diploma issued by the school and showed it to them. They were all very happy, but Dad frowned and said dejectedly, "Graduation means unemployment. If you can choose a more complete school, it's really hard to do. Either the tuition is expensive or it's hard to get in. Relying on this little salary of your father, making you continue your studies will create problems for our whole family’s life…"

"Dad, I thought I could find an apprenticeship position to do, at least it can make up for some to you, Dad, what do you say, right?" I eagerly comforted.

"Your idea is also very right, but your foundation is not deep enough to become an apprentice. I'm afraid you will regret reading less in the future... How about this, Aurora University also has an attached middle school. It is very good for you to study medicine there. You try it out, that is, if I unfortunately owe you your study time," Dad said earnestly, which is the motivation for my exam! The next day, I took the seven or eight yuan of blood and sweat money that my father gave me, stepped out of the alley, and took the tram to Aurora. Because it was far away, I couldn't walk. When I turned at Luban Road, I saw a wide building, a vertical church, lush trees on both sides, and the middle school opposite. Looking up, I only saw the four gilded characters of Aurora University, which fully showed that it already had a long history. In contrast to the newly built school building, this is so meaningful... At first, I didn't know the way, so a teahouse worker led me to the registration office. Along the way, I saw trees on both sides, also showing their thousands of years of history. The tall dormitory was many times bigger than the room in my house. The little birds on the branches were singing their happy songs, and the fresh flowers on both sides fully highlighted their beauty. It was truly a beautiful picture. The wide tennis court was worlds apart from my alma mater. At the end, it was where I wanted to register. It was quiet inside, fully showing their spirit. The gentleman inside said, "Are you here to register for the exam?" I nodded and said, "Yes, sir." "Then please pay the registration fee of three yuan and show your school's certificate." So, after I paid the money and submitted the certificate, "Then you come to test on the 14th," he continued... On the day of the exam, timid me had already seen countless high school students and college students taking the exam. They were all smiling and waiting for you to take the exam. Soon, the bell rang, and all the students moved to the auditorium to take the exam. A solemn atmosphere made people feel respectful. The exam papers had been distributed to each person's seat. When I picked up the question, the composition was still good, but the students were probably saying that the arithmetic was very difficult, with sweat all over their faces, scratching their heads and ears, a grotesque appearance, indescribable. There was one question I couldn't solve. Looking around, everyone had already handed in their papers. Only a few, like morning stars, were still calculating. The priest was next to me, urging me urgently. I was so anxious that tears were about to come out of my eyes. Physics and chemistry were considered easy, but some people also said they were difficult. When I got home, my father asked worriedly, "How did the exam go?" I replied, "Still good." When it came to the day of the announcement, I waited early for the deity of the announcement to reveal it. Sure enough, my name was revealed on the announcement board. I was surprised and happy to report the good news to my father that I was admitted. But my father was still worried about where the tuition would come from, "We must find a way to make the child continue to study so that he can pursue further education in the future, won't we be able to settle down as a family..." So my father has been busy with work lately!

### In the Same Boat Through Wind and Rain
— He Jia Zhi

(7) Lightning

Wei Cheng sat down and argued with Cui Zhen. Seeing that the veins on both sides of his temples were swelling up, Cui Zhen didn't dare to say more, and only smiled: "It's good that Chengdi is not worried. These days, the weather is especially cold. The sun doesn't come out, and the clouds are yellow. The daytime is only like dusk. It's going to snow. Chengdi, can you wear a fur robe this year? I sunned that dark blue fur robe for you during the hot summer days. It's not bad, the fur doesn't fall off, and the worms don't eat it." When Wei Cheng heard Cui Zhen talk about the problem of wearing clothes, he said, "I haven't worn a fur robe for three years, and I don't wear it even more during mourning; I don't feel cold either." At that time, he went from sighing to cold, and that was it, but in Cui Zhen's heart, she always felt that Wei Cheng had encountered a great electric event, and she was not willing to give up her responsibility of always being attentive.

One day, Wei Cheng walked from his bedroom to Shuangmei Bookstore, and Cui Zhen slipped into his bedroom, wanting to find a clue from everything in the bedroom. Cui Zhen found it. She saw a piece of paper pressed under the glass pad on the table. This piece of paper was somewhat familiar to her. She put one finger on the paper on the glass pad and quickly pulled the paper out. Taking another look, it was exactly what she had seen in Shuangmei Bookstore. She tore it open and inserted it into her arms, and immediately went to send it to Mrs. Ye Er. Mrs. Ye Er was flipping through several rental books. Cui Zhen walked to her side with a happy look on her face. Mrs. Ye turned her head and saw that it was Cui Zhen. Cui Zhen took out the paper and smiled: "Second Aunt, look, last time, Chengdi saw this paper, and his face changed. Today I found it in his room. Since the day he saw this paper, he has been uneasy..." Mrs. Ye Er didn't listen to Cui Zhen's words, but only cared about picking up the will to read. After reading a few lines, she said: "This was written by my sister-in-law." After she finished reading, she folded the paper together, raised her head and thought, and said to herself: "Oh, she also wrote this paper for the child, I didn't know." Cui Zhen said: "Second Aunt, what is so deadly in this paper, killing someone, that makes people's hearts scared when they read it." Mrs. Ye Er said: "Don't make a sound, this is our Ye family's unfortunate event, it has nothing to do with you, don't be so happy, when your Chengdi sees this paper, I think his heart is like having a dozen knives stabbing him."
