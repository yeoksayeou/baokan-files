### US National Promotion: Metal Collection Campaign
Washington, December 12th, Havas News Agency - The iron and other metal collection campaign initiated by the War Production Board will begin tomorrow. Newspapers and radio stations will call on the public to donate unneeded steel, lead, copper, aluminum, bronze, tin, and other metals, as well as lubricants and rubber, to the relevant authorities.

US Wartime Labor Force
Vichy, December 12th, Allied News Agency - According to Havas' Washington dispatch, Mr. McNard, Chairman of the American Manpower Resources Committee, recently announced the number of American workers in wartime as follows: The total number of workers in the United States reaches 50 million, of which 12.5 million are engaged in military industries. In the next six months, another 5 million people will be assigned to serve in military factories, and female workers will be employed. It is noted that the number of workers in military factories was 1.4 million in 1940, 5.3 million in 1941, 6.9 million in January of this year, and is expected to increase to 12 million in June. However, there are still 2.6 million unemployed people in the United States, most of whom are unsuitable for working in military factories due to lack of training. The government has spent $90 million to train 3 million workers.

British Aircraft Lay Mines in the Baltic Sea

Thai Prime Minister Hosts Special Envoy Hirota
Bangkok, December 13th, Allied News Agency - Mr. Hirota, the special envoy leading the Japanese delegation to Thailand, along with Ambassadors Tsubogami and Yano, and their staff, attended a dinner party hosted by Prime Minister Phibun at his official residence at 7:30 PM on the 13th. In addition to Prime Minister Phibun, all cabinet members from the Thai side attended. Prime Minister Phibun delivered a welcoming speech, stating that the so-called alliance treaty is a manifestation of the close relationship between the two countries. It expresses mutual respect for the independence and sovereignty of both countries, eliminates all hostile actions, and cooperatively fulfills the mission of building a new order in Greater East Asia. The friendly relations between Japan and Thailand began hundreds of years ago and will become even closer in the future. Japan absolutely respects Thailand's territorial sovereignty and its independent integrity, and will strive to restore world peace, build the East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, and cooperate with Japan in political, military, and economic aspects. After Prime Minister Phibun's speech, Ambassador Hirota delivered a response, saying, "This is my first visit to your country, but I have long known and admired your people's traditional spirit of upholding independence and autonomy. Under the leadership of Prime Minister Phibun, your people have demonstrated independent brilliance in this complex and ever-changing autumn, skillfully managed the environment, maintained the dignity of Asian nations, and promoted a great national spirit. In particular, your great contribution to the construction of Greater East Asia is something I deeply admire."

Okamoto Praises German and Italian Victory
Bangkok, December 13th, Haito News Agency - Lieutenant General Okamoto, a member of the Japanese delegation to Thailand, told a reporter from Haito News Agency today that the recent victories of Germany and Italy in Europe have significant implications. He predicted that extremely significant events would occur within this year. Okamoto believes that the destruction of British and American escort fleets in the Arctic Ocean by German air and naval forces is worthy of attention from people around the world. Lieutenant General Okamoto arrived in Germany in 1929 and followed the German army in handling overseas affairs for six years before returning to his country. In 1940, he went to Berlin again to serve as the military attach√© at the Japanese Embassy, and was transferred to another position the following year.

The Scenery of the Aleutians
Before the final outcome of the Southwest Pacific battles is determined, Americans are already shouting, "The future battlefields are in Australia and Alaska." Why are they indicating this so quickly? According to my speculation, there are no more than the following three reasons. First, they have already seen that the American operations in the Southwest Pacific will definitely fail. Second, they are afraid that Japan will extend its offensive to the Aleutians and Alaska in order to directly threaten the American mainland; third, they are intimidating Japan by saying that although the United States has lost its southern strategic base, it can still attack Japan from the north.

When I heard the Americans shouting like this at that time, I couldn't help but smile and say, "Yes, the future battlefields are in Australia and Alaska." But when will that time come? Australia is a longer story; the Aleutian campaign, I think it will be around June. I make this statement not based on simple speculation, but because of experience. Based on this experience, I have been waiting for the opening of the Aleutian war. Sure enough, on June 4th, Japanese naval aircraft were already flying over the American air and naval bases in the Aleutian Islands. Seven days later, its ground troops also launched attacks on key points on the islands one after another.

Regardless of what Americans say afterwards, whether the Aleutians are priceless islands, judging from the fact that the United States spent 100 million US dollars to build fortifications on the islands before the war, we can also appreciate the military significance of the Aleutians. From Dutch Harbor (the largest air and naval base in the Aleutian Islands) to Tokyo, it is only 4,560 kilometers. This is 360 kilometers shorter than Midway Island, which the United States planned as a base for air raids on Japan. If there are excellent aircraft, then it is not impossible to plan to use this as a base to bomb Japan back and forth. British military commentator B. H. Liddell Hart said, "The United States is a firebrand aimed at Japan's head," which is why he said that.

However, if the United States wants to use the Aleutians as a base to attack Japan, it must be limited by natural conditions, namely the seasons. The Aleutians are a chain of islands that divide the Bering Sea and the Pacific Ocean. For two-thirds of the year, the climate is winter. In winter, snow and ice fly, and the cold is biting, and airplanes and warships have no room to maneuver. In May of each year, although the ice and snow on the plains have begun to melt, they are still sometimes threatened by snow and fog. By June, true spring gradually arrives, with green grass and blooming flowers, and the weather gradually stabilizes. At this time, the residents often use the words "Sun Shines" as a greeting when they meet each other every day. In August, autumn begins. After the middle of the month, the fog becomes more and more frequent day by day, and the snow becomes heavier and heavier day by day, until winter arrives. This is the limitation that the seasons impose on the Aleutians, so if the United States wants to attack Japan from the Aleutians, it can only take advantage of the good season in June. However, time and routes are shared; the time and routes that the United States can use to attack Japan, Japan can also use to attack the United States. The Aleutians are America's route to attack Japan, but in the eyes of the Japanese, they are also Japan's route to attack America. The road is not only for one person to walk; Japan will eventually take the first step. I am an amateur when it comes to military strategy, so I won't talk about the significance of this capture of the Aleutians, but I can report a fact: I heard that the Naval Ministry was extremely excited after learning of the success of the attack on the Aleutians. They believe that this success can be compared to the air raid on Pearl Harbor and the sinking of the Prince of Wales.

The operations in the Aleutians are extremely difficult geographically. The first is the danger of navigation. The waters around the Aleutian Islands are surprisingly shallow, and there are many reefs. Even today, there is still no accurate nautical chart. When I sailed across the Aleutians in the past, I was only on a small ship of 220 tons. Because at that time, the shipping industry was in a slump, and shipping companies were unwilling to risk sailing 3,000-ton ships here.

The Aleutian Islands belong to the volcanic system. On the white ground, you can see volcanoes spewing smoke and fire everywhere, so earthquakes are also common. Submarine changes and the emergence of new islands have not yet stopped today. Fifty miles northwest of the famous Unalaska Island, there is Bogoslof Island, which appeared in 1928. Its shape changes every year. Near the coast of Adak Island, near the Kamchatka Peninsula, there are also magnetic storms. When I went to the Aleutians before, I encountered such a big storm at sea.

Although it is not completely dark on the islands, the night in the Aleutians is particularly short. In summer, it is only after 11 PM that the sky begins to darken. When I lived on Atka Island, I had nothing to do. Sometimes I fished in the melting snow water, sometimes I hunted some game in the mountains and fields, and sometimes I found some unknown shells on the sand. After playing for a long time, I also felt hungry, and the sky seemed to be dusk, but looking at my watch, it was past 10 PM. The night came so late, but the east was already bright before 2 AM.

Kamchatka, Alaska, and the Aleutians are at the same latitude. However, the former two are full of lush forests, while the latter is a land without trees. There are grasslands, but unfortunately, what appears before people's eyes is desolate and monotonous. This is because the seasons affect the soil quality.

With such seasons and such terrain, not to mention fighting a war, it is not easy to spend a severe winter here.

If we look at the northern theater of operations with the eyes of resourcefulness in the southern theater of operations, no one can avoid being surprised and at a loss. In the south, underground resources are of the utmost importance. But in the north, except for Alaska, there are no underground resources in the Aleutians. The Aleutians also have their treasures: salmon, trout, cod, halibut, and other aquatic resources. The production of salmon and trout in the Bering Sea once accounted for seven-tenths of the world's production, and the amount produced is truly amazing. In addition to aquatic products, the Aleutians also produce fur, which, although not as abundant as aquatic products, is also quite large.

The people on the islands belong to the Aleut people. Their lives are mainly maintained by hunting blue foxes. I once conducted a survey among the residents there, and a family has an average annual income of five or six thousand US dollars, most of which comes from hunting. The Aleut society is still a primitive communist organization. The hunting of blue foxes is carried out jointly by the residents. The benefits obtained are also equally distributed among the families. There is no exploitation among them. Although under harsh natural conditions, they live a kind of ideal life.

Emergency in the Don River Battle Situation: Soviet Troops Retreat from Two More Cities
Southern Germany Advances Towards Rostov, Voronezh Falls (Unconfirmed by Soviets)
Moscow, December 12th, Havas News Agency - The Red Army General Staff announced in a battle report tonight that the Red Army has abandoned the areas of Gremyachaya and Lisichansk, located southeast of Kharkov, due to the continued advance of General Bock's forces from Southern Germany.

Moscow, December 13th, Allied News Agency - The Soviet Information Bureau's midnight battle report acknowledged the abandonment of Gremyachaya (45 miles south of Rossoch) and Lisichansk (60 miles east of Izyum) on the Don River front. Fighting is currently taking place around Panenza. According to military observers here, the situation on the Don River front is critical. It is estimated that German forces in the Volokonovka area are reorganizing to prepare for a second offensive. It is also acknowledged here that the German military operations are entirely dependent on the concentration of a large number of aircraft. On a 200-mile-long front, the German forces had only 50 to 70 aircraft at certain key points before the offensive, but the number of aircraft suddenly increased to 500 or 600 when the offensive was launched. It is claimed that the German forces had 10,000 to 11,000 aircraft in the spring, of which 5,000 to 6,000 were at the forefront.

Ankara, December 12th, Haito News Agency - Moscow officials acknowledged yesterday that the situation for Soviet troops on the Don River front is very serious. According to recent information here, a large German force has already crossed the Don River near Voronezh. The Soviet newspaper "Red Star" stated that the German forces had received a large number of reinforcements, so the German forces and military equipment on that line far exceeded the Soviet forces. The situation is very critical at various points where the German forces have broken through our army's defenses. The fighting near Kantemirovka, south of Voronezh, is particularly fierce. German reinforcements have also arrived there. The Moscow side has not yet acknowledged the news that Voronezh has fallen, which was claimed by the German side a few days ago, only stating that the situation in the city is very difficult.

Somewhere on the Ukrainian Border, December 12th, Havas News Agency - According to reports from the front lines, after breaking through the strong Soviet defenses in the Taganrog area, the German forces are advancing towards Rostov, progressing 10 miles. Another German armored unit is advancing towards the city of Volov, which is north of Taganrog and southeast of Voronezh. German forces occupied the city of Boguchar last night, 40 miles southeast of the city of Rossoch. In this way, the next target of the German forces should be Stalingrad, which is a prelude to the attack on the Caucasus. According to various telegrams, it is said that the German attacks on Rostov, Voroshilovgrad, and Stalingrad are becoming increasingly fierce, and since the above three places are the gateway to the Caucasus, there is no doubt that the German target is the Caucasus. Six days ago, General Timoshenko led his troops to counterattack, and at first forced the German forces to retreat to the other side of the Krasnaya River, but since the German forces occupied the city of Rossoch and Boguchar, the rear of the Soviet troops on the east bank of the Donets River has been threatened. Timoshenko then ordered his troops to retreat to the Don River area. Since the German forces occupied Lisichansk (the end point of the Rostov oil pipeline), Slavyanoserbsk, and Nikolayevsk, almost the entire Donets River area has fallen into the hands of the German forces, and only Voroshilovgrad is still in the hands of the Soviet forces, but the German forces have now approached the city walls directly. The German forces in the northern Donets River are advancing even faster. Since occupying the city of Starobilsk on the 10th of this month, the German forces have continued to advance. Last night, they crossed the city of Belovodsk and reached a point 30 miles west of the Voronezh-Rostov railway line. In addition, a large bag-shaped position has been formed between the Don River and the Donets River. In order to preserve its strength, the Soviet Union has only concentrated its main force in the Don River basin, so the battle for Stalingrad and the Volga River is likely to unfold in the Don River basin. German military circles expect Rostov to fall soon, as the main Soviet defenses there have been broken through. Also, the counterattack by General Chukov's Soviet forces north of Orel has come to an end, as Chukov knows that if the German forces attack from the north, he will be surrounded.

Berlin, December 13th, Haito News Agency - Responsible authorities here recently stated that the German forces in the Orel area are attacking the enemy effectively, which has greatly weakened the enemy's combat power. On October 10th, with the cooperation of the German army and air force, the invading enemy was repeatedly dealt a head-on blow, resulting in heavy losses in Soviet soldiers and material resources, and their offensive power has been significantly weakened. The German forces then launched a counterattack, recaptured several villages, and finally restored the original front line. On Saturday, German reconnaissance aircraft observed that the enemy had concentrated a large number of infantry and tanks, seemingly intending to attack, so they notified the German bomber squadrons to launch a concentrated bombing attack. Afterwards, it was discovered that 60 tanks and a large number of artillery, ammunition, and vehicles had been destroyed. In the Erziel area, the German forces began to attack the enemy on July 10th, and encountered weak resistance. After the Soviet forces disintegrated, they lost many prisoners and artillery, and the enemy's attempt to encircle them failed. In the air battles on Saturday in the Lair and Hansichief areas, a total of 20 Soviet aircraft were shot down.

Berlin, December 13th, Haito News Agency - A certain air force unit of the German army stationed in the central sector of the Eastern Front once made its 5,000th air raid into the Soviet Union, penetrating deep into enemy territory to bomb its transportation lines and airfields, destroying 100 aircraft on land. Railway lines were bombed 673 times. Enemy positions, concentrated troops, tanks, and other military targets were also bombed, destroying 68 tanks, 4 armored trains, and many artillery positions. Since the beginning of the war, this unit has bombed the enemy 8,000 times.

Berlin, December 13th, Haito News Agency - The German High Command issued a special war report stating that the Rzhev fortress, a key point more than 200 kilometers west of Moscow, being both a railway junction and a military stronghold, was the site of fierce fighting by German and allied forces on the 11th, destroying the Soviet positions southwest of Rzhev. Several divisions of enemy infantry and cavalry, as well as a tank brigade, were surrounded and annihilated, capturing more than 30,000 prisoners. 218 enemy tanks were damaged, along with 591 cannons, hundreds of machine guns, and countless other military supplies and equipment. There were also many enemy soldiers killed.

German Army's Victory on the Eastern Front Due to Egg-Shaped Armored Vehicles
Rome, December 13th, Allied News Agency - According to a report from the front-line reporter of the Roman newspaper "Il Popolo di Roma," the German army used a new type of egg-shaped tank in the fighting on the Don River front. This tank can transport troops and can also be used for attacks. After capturing a location, the German army can quickly transport a large number of reinforcements to occupy the location, making it impossible for the enemy to counterattack. This type of tank can drive over mud and any obstacles.

Stockholm, Sweden, December 12th, Havas News Agency - It is reported that the German army is fighting with all its strength on the Eastern Front, and its most effective tactic is the close coordination of armored vehicle formations, infantry units, and air force units. For example, the number of tanks concentrated when attacking a certain point is almost unprecedented. This type of operation has long become the golden rule of German military tactics, but new tactics are still constantly being developed at the beginning of the offensive. The offensives on the Kursk and Vyazma lines are examples of this. According to disclosures from the German military authorities, for several days before ordering the offensive, the German army mobilized countless armored vehicles and infantry on the front lines. Soviet aircraft only knew from aerial reconnaissance that the German forces were concentrating on a large scale in various places, and the Soviet military authorities could not ascertain where the real offensive would be launched. And when the German offensive was launched, the battle line was extremely wide, and there was no sign of an encirclement operation. For example, in the recent battles in the Donets River and Don River basins, the German forces launched a full-scale frontal attack, and the Red Army was unable to defend against it and had to retreat step by step, even retreating to the east bank of the Don River, as it already felt that the city of Voronezh was in a dangerous situation. In addition, according to reports from the south, the German air force is launching large-scale bombing attacks on the ports of the Sea of Azov, seemingly as a prelude to the attack on Rostov and the Caucasus.

German Troops on Crete Will Advance Towards Egypt
Fierce Fighting in the Alamein Area
Bern, Switzerland, December 12th, Havas News Agency

Correspondents from Turkish newspapers recently reported that shocking events will soon occur in the Near East. General Rommel's forces, the commander-in-chief of the German forces in North Africa, have completed their assigned tasks, and the decisive battle that should be launched in the future will be undertaken by the German forces on Crete. This force is likely to attack various important centers in Egypt, and the motorized units led by General Rommel are only achieving preliminary success. In addition, a bulletin issued by Berlin this month strongly stated that German aircraft are very active on the Egyptian front lines and bombed enemy barracks, supply convoys, and artillery positions in the Alamein area of Egypt yesterday. Although British anti-aircraft fire was fierce, the German aircraft's bombing work proceeded smoothly, destroying many of their motorcycles. Several enemy tanks were hit, and seven fighter planes were shot down.

Tokyo, December 12th, Allied News Agency - Reports from Zurich, quoting sources in Rome, state that the German and Italian forces in North Africa have launched a major offensive against the British forces in the Alamein area. A fierce battle between the mechanized units of the two armies immediately broke out. The Axis forces forced the British forces on the entire front line, and the counterattack of the British forces in the north was completely hopeless. After a fierce attack, the British forces in the south also gradually collapsed eastward, so a semi-circular encirclement of the left flank of the British forces has been formed. At the same time, the German and Italian artillery units also launched a fierce bombardment of the British positions in Alamein, causing them heavy damage.

Berlin, December 13th, Haito News Agency - According to military correspondent Bockelmann, armored units have broken through the Alamein positions. The enemy is resisting desperately. The remnants of the British Eighth Army are concentrating many vehicles between Alexandria and Alamein, as well as in the Nile Delta and Qattara. German aircraft attacked the enemy's rear, while British aircraft bombed the airfields of the Axis forces.

Rome, December 13th, Havas News Agency - The High Command announced this morning that a major battle continued in the Alamein area yesterday. The Axis forces repelled various new offensives by the enemy and inflicted heavy losses on them. Axis aircraft carried out bombing attacks, and fires broke out in many places in the enemy's rear.

Activities of the Italian Navy in the Mediterranean
Rome, December 13th, Haito News Agency - Responsible authorities recently released a report on the activities of the Italian Navy. It is claimed that in the two years since the start of the war, the average voyage of Italian battleships was 9,880 miles, while the voyage of the battleship "Vittorio Veneto" was 15,073 miles. The average voyage of Italian cruisers was 20,450 miles, with the highest individual record being 28,103 miles set by the cruiser "Attilio Regolo." The average voyage of destroyers was 39,200 miles, with the highest individual record being 54,658 miles set by the destroyer "Nori." The average voyage of torpedo boats was 35,200 miles, with the highest individual record being 50,538 miles set by the "MAS 1." As for what Churchill often called "the great victory of Taranto," claiming that the Italian fleet had been completely destroyed, this is not true. In reality, only three battleships were hit, while the rest of the ships were safe and sound. Moreover, two of the battleships rejoined naval service after four months, and the third battleship, although hit by two torpedoes, was also re-enlisted into the fleet after eighteen months. According to documents from the British Admiralty, since the beginning of the war, Britain has lost a total of 11 cruisers in the Mediterranean, while Italy has lost only 7 of its 39 cruisers in 1940, three of which were sunk in a battle with a strong enemy fleet on the night of March 27, 1941. At that time, the Italian ships had no special protection equipment, but now the Italian ships have been improved. Regarding Italy's new ships, matters are military secrets and cannot be disclosed, but the number is not small. The Italian Navy will continue to control the Mediterranean.

British Aircraft Fly Over Swedish Airspace
Danzig Port Attacked by Air
German Aircraft Attack Southwest Coast of Britain
Stockholm, Sweden, December 12th, Havas News Agency

German officials released a bulletin last night stating that a squadron of British bombers violated Swedish neutrality yesterday, flying over southern Sweden, especially the Kattegat and √ñresund Straits, seemingly intending to drop mines. They also attacked the port of Danzig once. The targets of the British aircraft were concentrated on schools and civilian residences, destroying several houses and killing several civilians. A hospital and a nursing school, despite having Red Cross markings, were still bombed by British aircraft. Also, the Swedish Air Force Command issued a bulletin stating that last night from 8 PM to 10 PM, British aircraft flew from the west over Bohusl√§n and then flew south. Swedish fighter planes searched in the air, but did not come into contact with the British aircraft due to poor visibility. It was then reported that another 15 British aircraft were flying over Skaia and the archipelago of Arholma. Local anti-aircraft guns fired at them, and the ferries between Simrishamn and Simpersdal temporarily stopped.

Danzig, December 13th, Haito News Agency - According to authoritative sources, British aircraft bombed the town of T√∏nder in Denmark, killing and injuring many civilians. One woman and two girls were bombed to death, and a house was severely damaged. A train was bombed near Durstrup, the engine was severely damaged, the driver was killed, and the fireman was also injured. One British aircraft was shot down by German anti-aircraft artillery near Lesby, and two pilots were killed. One British aircraft raided Denmark and caused no damage. German anti-aircraft artillery shot down one British aircraft.

London, December 12th, Havas News Agency
According to official announcements, two German destroyer aircraft dropped several bombs on the southwest coast of England this afternoon.

Former Prime Minister Tardieu, who has retired, is seriously ill. It is reported that his life is not in danger.

Special Article in This Newspaper: Arabia, Past and Present (7)
In order to encourage the Arabs to revolt against Turkey, Britain outwardly allowed that, after the success, Arabia could independently establish a country. But secretly, Britain and France had already divided Arabia. Syria was assigned to France, Iraq to Britain, while the Arabs were kept in the dark. Britain used various means, on the one hand, to lure Hussein, the Sharif of Mecca, to establish the Kingdom of Hejaz, and on the other hand, to secretly win over the chieftain of the Najd State in the center of the desert, to restrain Hussein. Britain's intention was to use the slogan of Arab unification to let most of the Arabian Peninsula fall into their own hands, but Britain had to have the opportunity to manipulate it. The Arab coastal areas and the Crescent region were completely controlled by Britain.

After the end of World War I, several mandate rule states were indeed established in the Crescent region. Iraq, Palestine, Syria, and Transjordan were assigned to Britain and France respectively, and the King of Iraq and the King of Transjordan were both sons of Hussein. This was considered Arab unification.

Unfortunately, King Hussein of Hejaz was an unsupportable dead dog. His politics were corrupt and autocratic, and his religious life was not strict. Therefore, the people of Hejaz unanimously opposed him politically and religiously. He called himself the king of all Arabia, so he also occasionally showed resistance to British domination. This made the relationship between him and Britain not very smooth, so Britain contacted another Arab leader in the desert.

Another Arab leader was the tribal chieftain of the Najd region in the desert, Ibn Saud, the chieftain of the Najd State. This tribal chieftain was not only in a position to oppose Hussein politically, but also in a position to oppose Hussein religiously. Because the sect of the people in the desert is the puritanical sect of Islam, called the Wahhabi sect. They deeply believe in the teachings of the Quran, strictly adhere to the rules of life, and do not recognize the principles of the Caliphate. This is the opposite of Hussein's religious life.

Ibn Saud's father lost his country due to enemies. Saud, as an orphan, led his soldiers and restored the old country of Najd, and gradually prospered. In 1912, he had a war with Hussein, the Sharif of Mecca, and the two formed a deep feud from then on.

Ibn Saud trained the youth of the tribe, mixed religion, politics, and military affairs into one, and established a Brotherhood to conquer the world for him. He led this powerful army and developed in all directions, attempting to unify Arabia. In 1913, [illegible] from al-Hasa to the Persian [illegible]. In 1918, [the end of] World [War], Hussein of Hejaz, [armed] soldiers, attacked Najd, and Saud rose up and [launched a counter] attack on Hejaz. In 1921, the border of the Najd State directly bordered Iraq, and a conflict occurred with the British, who were attacked by the British air force and driven back. At the beginning of 1924, Ibn Saud sent troops out on three routes again, one route to Transjordan, one route to Iraq, and one route to Hejaz. The former two troops suffered losses from the British, and the latter troop easily entered the city of Mecca. Hussein had to flee, and Ibn Saud became the King of Najd and the King of Hejaz. This large area of territory was called the United Kingdom of Najd and Hejaz. From then on, this kingdom gradually moved towards modernization, and adopted Western methods in politics and economy. He built a new railway from the port of Jeddah on the Red Sea directly to Mecca for pilgrimage. His behavior was somewhat like Kemal of Turkey. In 1932, he changed the name of the United Kingdom to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. In 1934, he annexed Yemen, and the work of unifying Arabia seemed to fall on his shoulders. However, the heart of this unified country was not the old city of Mecca, but the newly emerging Najd tribal capital, Riyadh.

Judging from Ibn Saud's position, he has always disliked Britain, and has suffered losses in British hands. However, he understood his own strength, and did not launch any attacks on Britain. But because this desert hero existed, Britain's plan to protect Greater Arabia was hindered. Moreover, the security of the Crescent region and the security of navigation on the Red Sea were somewhat discounted. In the current Second World War, although Arabia is hiding in the corner without any involvement, the heroic Ibn Saud is probably destined to be a pivotal figure in the Near East stage of the World War!

The Port of Muscat on the Arabian Coast
Muscat was a place often passed through when African slaves were sold into Arabia. Although the slave trade has been prohibited by law for many years, it has not completely disappeared. In the past, when Portugal was at its strongest, it once occupied this place and built a high fortress, which still exists today, namely the houses on the mountains. The Arabs say that hell is under this bay, so it is extremely hot.

Re-vaccination to Prevent Cholera
Re-issuing Vaccination Certificates
The first vaccination certificates will be abolished soon
French Authorities Hope Residents Will Get Vaccinated Quickly
There has been an outbreak of genuine cholera in the Nanshi area of this city. Twelve people have been infected, and one has died. In the Zhabei area, four people have been infected. A blind beggar in the French Concession collapsed near Xiaodongmen after contracting the disease in Nanshi. The French Concession authorities urge residents to get vaccinated immediately to prevent infection. Vaccination locations are 630 Baille Road and 840 Xujiahui Road, and the time is every afternoon.

Second Vaccination Starts on the 16th
The English "Shanghai Times" reported that, according to an announcement made by the Shanghai Epidemic Prevention Committee at a meeting of the Xingya Yuan last week, the health authorities of this city have decided to implement a second cholera vaccination starting this Thursday (the 16th). It is believed that this decision was made due to the discovery of genuine cholera cases in the two concessions and the Chinese area.

Advise Housewives Not to Buy Raw Fish
Due to the encouragement of the health authorities, most of the residents of Shanghai have now received the first vaccination. It is believed that this second vaccination will guarantee that every resident will not suffer from the transmission of terrible germs. The sale of raw fish in local vegetable markets will soon be prohibited, and most housewives have also been advised not to buy raw fish anymore, as cholera germs often spread in raw fish.

Total of Fourteen Cholera Cases
In the past week in Shanghai, fourteen cholera cases have been discovered. On July 6th, eight Chinese residents were found to be suffering from cholera. These patients are all staying in Shanghai's infectious disease hospital. The next day, three more cholera cases were discovered in Zhabei. At the same time, one person was discovered in Zhabei on the 8th, and one person in Nanshi. The most recent cholera case was discovered in the French Concession.

Vaccination Certificates Reissued
The announcement of the second compulsory vaccination to be implemented by the authorities of this city will be published soon. The vaccination certificates issued by the doctors or health departments for the first vaccination will also be explicitly abolished, and the second certificates will be reissued at that time.

Eighteen More Cases of Infection Discovered in Nanshi
Although the intense heat subsided yesterday, a large number of cholera patients continued to be discovered. In addition to the eighteen previously discovered, another eighteen have been confirmed to have genuine cholera. Their names, etc., are listed below: 19. Zhang Lianfu, resident of Huining Road, Nanshi; 20. Xu Yinshi, resident of Fahua Town; 21. Sun Yuhe, resident of Fangxie Road, Nanshi; 22. Chen Rufeng, resident of Xietu Road, Nanshi; 23.

### Rumor: Britain Demands Egypt Declare War on the Axis; Mechanized Units Surround the Palace; Egypt‚Äôs Farouk Refuses to Accept

Stockholm, Switzerland, 12th, Havas Agency

According to a telegram from a Chang in front of "Swiss Daily", a major incident of "British troops forcing the palace" was heard in the Egyptian capital yesterday. The general situation is as follows: The British Ambassador to Egypt paid a visit to King Farouk yesterday morning and presented him with an ultimatum, demanding that Egypt declare war on the Axis powers, with a deadline of several hours to decide. If there is no satisfactory answer, the king will be treated as a prisoner. The ambassador had previously contacted General Stone, the commander-in-chief of the British forces in Egypt, to prepare. When the deadline expired and the king did not answer, British motorized units surrounded the palace, attempting to abduct the king. Upon hearing the news, the Egyptian Minister of Defense immediately rushed to the head of the British military delegation in Egypt, informing him that if the British tank fleet did not immediately withdraw from the vicinity of the palace, Egypt would declare war on Britain. The British hesitated upon hearing this. The outcome of this matter is still unclear. It is rumored that the British originally intended to send King Farouk to Cyprus for confinement. The Egyptian government is now quickly taking various steps to deal with all incidents.

Tokyo, 13th, Allied News Agency dispatch: According to a telegram from Lisbon, the British Ambassador to Egypt, Lampson, and the commander of the British forces in Egypt, Stoneton, handed King Farouk of Egypt an ultimatum demanding that the Egyptian army participate in the war against Germany. The Egyptian Prime Minister Nahas was also present at the time. Farouk has completely rejected this British demand. Prime Minister Nahas told reporters on the 12th that the Egyptian people are determined not to take any action to participate in the war. According to the Asahi Shimbun, a special telegram from Stockholm states that according to Cairo intelligence from Ankara, the Egyptian House of Representatives recently held a secret meeting to discuss in detail the development of the North African war and Egypt's attitude. It is said that it has been decided that Egypt will continue to strictly maintain neutrality in this war.

Cairo, 12th, Havas Agency: Egyptian Prime Minister Nahas met with King Farouk today to report on the recent military situation and its impact on the domestic political situation. He then convened a cabinet meeting to discuss countermeasures. In the evening, the Egyptian Minister of Defense also met with General Cravering, the head of the British military delegation, for a long time. Many senior military officers were also present at the time.

Stockholm, Switzerland, 12th, Havas Agency

The Geneva Tribune today published an article reviewing the Egyptian political situation, stating that after the North African troops threatened Alexandria, Egypt's political situation became even more unstable. Britain had to go beyond the scope of cooperation stipulated in the 1936 Anglo-Egyptian Treaty and take various emergency measures. Although the general public in Egypt is still in a passive position, the political parties have been unusually active recently. Many members of the Nationalist Party believe that they can take advantage of the current situation to demand new concessions from Britain and abolish the article in the 1936 Anglo-Egyptian Treaty that allows British supervision of Egyptian internal affairs. The leader of the Nationalist Party, the current Prime Minister Nahas, has convened a general meeting of the party to eliminate the divisive elements recently discovered in the party. Some powerful party members who refused to attend the general meeting have been expelled from the party.

Officials claim that the actions of these people will not undermine the power of the Prime Minister, and that the public will not echo the insurgents. However, there is reason to believe that the national political agitation is more profound than officials acknowledge. Student demonstrations have recently occurred in Cairo, and there have been calls for a general strike. If this is realized, railways and other forms of transportation will be paralyzed. At a time when British troops are frequently being transferred along the Nile, and normal and rapid transportation is indispensable, the impact will be significant. Judging from other factors, it can also be proved that quite a few members of the public and the Nationalist Party trust the Axis powers and fully rely on the guarantees from Germany and Italy that Egypt will be freed from foreign pressure and restore its independence. At present, there are quite a few people who are determined to cooperate with the Axis powers once the environment is favorable. Britain is well aware that its position in Egypt has been greatly shaken, and has taken various measures to deal with it. The Egyptian indigenous army, which was originally stationed at strategic points throughout the country, especially at key fortresses and dams along the Nile, has now been transferred elsewhere and replaced by British troops. Britain has also sent a senior official to supervise the various measures taken by the Egyptian Minister of the Interior. In addition, a military officer has been appointed to assist Prime Minister Nahas in supervising national military affairs. All these measures have gone far beyond the scope of the 1936 Anglo-Egyptian Treaty and are tantamount to Britain establishing a protectorate over Egypt. What we want to know now is how the Egyptian people will react to this.
