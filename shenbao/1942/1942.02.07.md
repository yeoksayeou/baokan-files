### The Burmese War Gradually Intensifies; Japanese Troops Cross the Salween River; Intense Artillery Battles in Singapore Yesterday

Tokyo, 6th (Domei News Agency) – Aerial activity is high on the Burmese front today. According to a British military communiqué from Rangoon, Japanese troops have crossed the Salween River 40 miles north of Moulmein. Japanese forces advancing north from Moulmein have occupied Pa-an, 20 miles north on the east bank of the Salween. With the Japanese crossing the Salween River westward, Martaban, opposite Moulmein, will be surrounded. British forces will likely retreat from Martaban in the near future, otherwise they will be cut off and encircled.

Rangoon, 5th (Havas Agency) – The British General Headquarters here has just released a battle report stating that Japanese troops crossed the Salween River at several points and are currently advancing westward.

Rangoon, 6th (Reuters) – Army authorities announced last night that there was some artillery fire yesterday on the Salween River front. British Air Force authorities also announced that British aircraft continued to provide cover for infantry forces in the Moulmein area, bombing Japanese positions. Japanese aircraft also bombed the airfield north of Rangoon on Wednesday night.

Burma Front, 6th (Domei News Agency) – A large squadron of Japanese bombers heavily attacked the airfield south of Rangoon for three hours this morning. All aircraft returned safely.

Bangkok, 6th (Haitong News Agency) – According to news received here, after Japanese aircraft bombed Rangoon again, the local radio station fell silent yesterday morning, presumably destroyed by bombing. Several locations in the eastern suburbs and western areas of the Rangoon River were also hit.

Rangoon, 5th (Reuters) – A military spokesman stated tonight that although Japanese forces have sent advance units to patrol the Salween River, there has been no large-scale attempt to cross it. Pa-an, 25 miles above Moulmein on the east bank of the Salween, has well-constructed roads and ferry services. Japanese activity there may indicate preparations for using it as a central point for a major crossing. Therefore, the Royal Air Force is continuing operations in the same manner as before. The main objective of the Japanese offensive in Burma is to occupy Rangoon, thereby cutting off the Yunnan-Burma Road. However, the Japanese advance cannot be allowed to continue indefinitely. The spokesman continued that we have formulated countermeasures, but the details cannot be announced.

London, 6th (Reuters) – British officials are equally concerned about Singapore and Burma. The Burmese campaign is a battle for the Yunnan-Burma Road. There is reason to believe that the Japanese may not cut off the road in the northern section near Lashio but prefer to cut it off at the southern terminus in Rangoon. Well-informed sources believe that the Japanese have concentrated troops to prepare for operations along the Salween River to cover the advance on Rangoon and the Irrawaddy River basin, simultaneously cutting off the railway connecting to the Yunnan-Burma Road. Japanese aircraft and artillery bombard Martaban and Pa-an (both cities along the Salween River) to make it difficult for the defending forces to hold the positions, facilitating the Japanese advance. It is reported that Japanese forces have penetrated deeply along the Salween River basin. The Japanese strategy is to (1) gain a foothold in Pa-an to advance on Rangoon, (2) surround the British forces in Martaban, and simultaneously force a crossing of the Sittang River to take Pegu, thereby cutting off Rangoon. Martaban has road and rail links to Rangoon, passing through Thaton and Pegu. Pegu is the junction for railways from Martaban to Lashio and Mandalay. The Sittang River is the next water defense line after the Salween River in the Japanese invasion route. After the Sittang River is the continuous road and railway from Rangoon to Lashio. Lashio is the starting point of the Chinese section of the Yunnan-Burma Road. If the Japanese strategy succeeds, it will have unfortunate consequences. A military spokesman from General Hutton's headquarters said that we will spare no sacrifice to defend Rangoon. Even if Rangoon falls, it is not the end. We have multiple plans to ensure the supply of goods to China.

Rangoon, 6th (Reuters) – The Burmese Minister of the Interior recently issued a broadcast stating that although the current situation is serious, there is no reason for pessimism. British Prime Minister Churchill has promised to strengthen military forces here, and China has already provided us with assistance. These two events are a ray of light in the darkness. The people should know that the future of Burma depends on the battle today. If we fail, the future of Burma will be utterly ruined.

### Germany and Italy Will Launch Large-Scale Offensive in the Near East; Important Decisions Made During Goering's Visit to Italy; Turkey Deeply Concerned About This Trend

Rome, 5th (Haitong News Agency) – German Air Minister General Goering returned to Germany by special train last night after an eight-day visit to Italy. Before his departure, Goering exchanged views with Italian Air Minister Fougier on cooperation between the German and Italian air forces. He then inspected Italian air force facilities with the Italian minister. The night before, General Kesselring hosted a banquet for air force officers from Germany and Italy, attended by Italian Foreign Minister Ciano and German Ambassador Mackensen. General Goering returned to Germany by special train at 11:30 PM that evening. Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, Foreign Minister Ciano, the ministers of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, the German ambassador, and other military and political dignitaries saw him off at the station.

Bern, Switzerland, 5th (Havas) – German Air Minister General Goering met with Italian Prime Minister Mussolini two days ago, and it is widely rumored that the two sides have reached important decisions. According to the Basler Nachrichten, Germany and Italy have decided to launch a large-scale offensive this spring. The theater of operations will be the eastern Mediterranean, where they will not only attack Egypt but also use Crete and the Dodecanese Islands as bases to attack Cyprus, Syria, Palestine, and even Malta. Although Turkey is a neutral country, it will have a direct stake in this new action by the Axis powers, as the new theater of operations could endanger Turkey's coast and land borders. Moreover, news from Syria and Cyprus indicates that important construction work has begun along the coast, and a large number of reinforcements have been sent to Palestine. The Turkish government is deeply concerned about this. According to the National Day Daily, London has long been wary of the future movements of the Axis forces. The British public is very concerned about whether General Rommel's rapid advance in North Africa will threaten Egypt. However, the British optimists believe that the country's position in Syria, Iraq, and Palestine is very solid, so the British General Headquarters can cope with any situation. On the contrary, Germany's greatest difficulty lies in obtaining a large supply of oil needed for combat, so the German General Headquarters will have to launch a "fuel offensive." In short, this offensive was expected by the British, and Turkey will bear the brunt.

He hoped that the British ambassador would also take the opportunity to formally express the same sentiment and maintain friendly relations within the scope of the existing treaty. Lampson replied, declaring that Britain regards Egypt as an independent ally and that the principle underlying British policy is to cooperate faithfully with an independent Egypt and implement the provisions of the existing Anglo-Egyptian Treaty without interfering in Egypt's internal affairs.

Rome, 6th (Havas) – After being ordered to form a cabinet, National Party leader Nahas, in addition to serving as prime minister, also concurrently manages the Ministries of Interior and Foreign Affairs.

At approximately 7:00 PM last night, bandits suddenly broke into 4 Lane 324, Nanjing Road. One bandit threatened with a sharp blade and robbed clothing and cash worth over 8,000 yuan.

### Announcement to Students Applying for Financial Aid; Also Requesting Readers to Continue Supporting the Righteous Cause

The Shenbao Readers' Student Aid Fund has been handling the second round of student aid matters for a month. The forms filled out by students applying at all levels, as well as the submitted transcripts, have been strictly reviewed. All those who can be assisted have been assisted to the best of our ability. The lists of names have been grouped and arranged and disclosed in this newspaper in succession. It is hoped that readers will take note. As the end of this round of student aid approaches, we dare to make a simple statement of the review process in order to report to all enthusiastic donors and to offer words of encouragement to all applying students.

When this round of student aid began, it was during a time of economic decline. The balance of funds was approximately 50,000 yuan. Continuing donations seemed difficult to accumulate into a significant amount, while the number of students from all levels coming to the office to apply was exceptionally large, more than double the previous round. Academic reports and school regulations were presented together in a mixed manner, piled up to a foot high. The staff of this newspaper therefore sorted through them daily, almost forgetting the hours. They thought to themselves that among these thousands of youths awaiting assistance, it was not easy to decide who could be selected and who would be disappointed, and how could a wide building be found to shelter them all and make them all happy?

The reason why the number of applicants in this round was so high was that the loan amounts for tuition fees managed by various newspapers had mostly been suspended, and private scholarships had also been temporarily discontinued. As a result, impoverished students were in a state of panic and had nowhere else to turn, all relying on this newspaper. The fact that the number of applicants was twice as high as before was not the only concern, but the increase in tuition fees at various schools was a major burden this time. For a junior high school student to raise more than 100 yuan for school fees in an impoverished family is a serious problem. In light of the increasing cost of living, education is already a difficult endeavor. It is unbearable to excessively criticize the schools for increasing fees. However, this newspaper, with limited aid funds, bears the great hope of society. The number of applicants is large, and the amount of aid requested is also higher. If it is not handled carefully, how can we be honest with the readers who donate money? And how can we comfort the countless youths who are waiting?

The staff of this newspaper has always held a belief that since the aid money is taken from the readers, and this newspaper is entrusted by the readers to handle the student aid affairs, we should abide by the readers' wishes, be fair and impartial, and handle matters with seriousness. The staff adheres to the established regulations, strictly examines and verifies, and does not allow any personal opinions to be mixed in. In other words, the readers' money, even a cent or a mill, should be put to proper use, and no waste should be allowed. Before the start of the review for this round, the staff resolved six matters: (1) This round will only provide aid for tuition fees, and books and miscellaneous fees will not be included; and the amount of aid may be half of the tuition fee, depending on the circumstances; (2) Applicants with excellent grades but whose family situation is still barely manageable will generally not be approved; (3) Conversely, applicants whose family situation is very poor but whose grades do not meet the standards or whose conduct is below B grade will be rejected; (4) Schools that are not widely respected will be subject to particularly strict screening; (5) Old students who applied and were approved in the previous round will be subject to more thorough examination of their grades and conduct, without favoritism; (6) For supplementary schools, applications without a report of grades from the previous semester and proof from the supervisor of the place of employment will not be considered.

Among the thousands of application forms, each one was reviewed individually, and there were indeed many cases that were unbearable to witness. The fathers and elder brothers of the applying students were mostly unemployed. Some families had returned to their hometowns, leaving only one person in Shanghai with nothing to eat or wear. Some were dependent on relatives, only borrowing a bed. Some fathers and brothers had not yet received their severance pay even though they had lost their jobs. These types of cases accounted for a significant portion. In another example, tuition fees were paid by the father last semester, but now the student has become a fatherless orphan, with a widowed mother and two or three younger siblings, struggling in poverty and unable to make ends meet. As for those whose parents were serving in the interior, in Chongqing or Kunming, with no way to remit money and the whole family focusing solely on food and clothing, there were countless others. The staff was heartbroken by what they saw, and when considering the applications, they often deliberated again and again, unwilling to easily reject them. Therefore, the review of every hundred applications took more than ten hours. The staff realized that what was recorded in these thousands of application forms was mostly the dark side of society at this time and in this place. If they were carefully analyzed and statistically tallied one by one, they would undoubtedly become valuable historical materials for this era.

However, there were also some disappointing events. In the reception room of this newspaper, students were interviewed daily, and some children from wealthy families entered with their heads held high, showing displeasure with the trivial questions from the staff, and even stating directly that the food in the school was bad and that they had to go to restaurants for every meal. The staff was accustomed to a simple life and only felt ashamed of themselves. They did not want to generously give the valuable tuition money to those people to increase their spending on food and drink. They could only send them away with a bitter smile and ask them to return home and reflect on themselves.

People must insult themselves before others insult them, and people must respect and love themselves before others respect and love them. The application forms of many students had illegible handwriting, which was daunting to look at. What was most regrettable was the applicant's signature, which was like earthworms or ghost symbols. At first glance, it could not be recognized, and only after careful examination could it be vaguely discerned. How can one expect to gain the respect and love of others when one does not respect and love one's own name? Furthermore, the principal of a certain private middle school led more than ten students in single file, filled out the forms on the spot, and signed and stamped them after completion, with a clear hierarchy. The grades of the students attached were also extremely excellent, with no major subjects below 80 points. The staff was not entirely foolish and certainly knew to carefully consider these kinds of well-planned applications.

What has been stated above is only a general overview. There are many other examples that could be cited, but due to space limitations, they will not be repeated. Now that the review work has come to an end, the names of the qualified students have been published in the newspaper in succession. However, in recent days, there have been students who were not approved who have come to the office weeping, hoping for a re-evaluation. The staff has also been moved by this, but upon reviewing the forms again, there are reasons why they cannot be accommodated. The meaning of student aid is completely different from the nature of giving out porridge or clothing. Therefore, even if a family is extremely poor, if the grades do not meet the standards, there is no possibility of approval. The staff made a decision in advance and swore an oath. When they reflect on themselves, they feel no shame. It is hoped that the applying students will cooperate with the staff to maintain this noble spirit. As they write this, they have received more than ten letters of inquiry, asking in detail the reason for not being approved. The staff has already said repeatedly that all those who can be assisted have been assisted to the best of their ability. If they were to change the established regulations and re-evaluate based solely on pleas for compassion, how could the staff face the readers who donate money?

Due to the large number of applicants and the increase in tuition fees, this round of aid will likely deplete the entire fund. Looking to the future, the next round of student aid will be difficult to continue. The staff of this newspaper is currently planning to organize group aid and is willing to lead the way, hoping that enthusiastic people in society will give broad sympathy and actively provide assistance so that the student aid work can be carried forward, become grand, and be permanently maintained. If readers truly consider the difficulty of finishing well what was started well, how can they bear to see it abandoned halfway?

Finally, there is something to say to the applying students. Education is the lifeline of the country, and youth are the pillars of society. At this difficult time, everyone shares a sense of shared hardship. Students who are still able to get the opportunity to continue their studies should face reality squarely, strive to acquire unlimited knowledge, save it for future use, and bear the heavy burden of their responsibilities. At this time, they should know to work hard and encourage themselves. The wealth of students is different, and the social environment also changes due to the changing times. However, the desire to learn and improve is not limited by wealth and environment. Those who receive help today will help others a hundredfold or a thousandfold in the future. Time waits for no one and passes quickly. Each has a conscience, why not strive forward! May all students encourage themselves!

### Existing Yarn Prices Continue to Hold Firm

The yarn market continues to show firmness. However, after the Yarn Industry Association registered cotton yarn but did not formally announce it, they decided not to open for business. All market prices are based on occasional off-the-book transactions by some traders. Transactions are limited to only three to five bales. 42-count Lanfeng yarn is priced at 4,150 yuan for factory orders and 4,330 yuan for spot goods. 40-count Xiantao yarn is priced at 3,700 yuan for spot goods. 20-count Yueqin yarn is priced between 2,380 and 2,370 yuan, with spot goods priced at 2,450 yuan. 20-count Shuang 지구 yarn is priced at 1,790 yuan. 16-count Hongkui Star yarn is priced at 1,900 yuan for factory orders. 20-count Shuangma yarn initially traded at 1,620 yuan and then rose to 1,690 yuan, an increase of 70 yuan compared to the previous day.

### Cotton Cloth Supply Falls Short of Demand

Factory Cloth: The market continued to rise yesterday, but due to the thin inventory, there was difficulty in meeting the demand. White cloth prices rose by one yuan, while blue cloth and bleached cloth prices rose by one to two yuan. Hua Die cloth was priced at 119 yuan, 14-pound Yongyu cloth at 85 yuan, 8-pound Zhenzhong cloth at 56 yuan, Dapeng fine cloth at 95 yuan, Jinbang Le blue cloth at 160 yuan, Chuji blue cloth at 154 yuan, and Lunchang floral cloth at 40 yuan.

Eastern cloth prices continued to rise sharply. 12-pound Longtou fine cloth factory orders opened at 94 yuan in the morning and continued to rise, reaching a high of 95.75 yuan. The closing price at noon was 95.5 yuan, an increase of three yuan per piece compared to the previous day. Longyu cloth was priced at 91.5 yuan, Caiqiu Yanghe at 91.25 yuan, and Laba at 90 yuan. These were all factory orders, and there was a situation of supply not meeting demand. Sijunzi serge for January new tax orders opened at 3.24 yuan, for October to December at 3.22 yuan, and for July to September at 3.19 yuan.

### Gold Prices Rise for Six Consecutive Days

Yesterday, the cash market for smelted gold continued to rise unabated. Prices jumped to over 12,000 yuan, mainly due to continued strong demand and the continuous absorption by Tongkangyong and jewelry stores. The general sentiment was bullish. The price opened well at 12,000 yuan per tael (ten taels) in the morning, with the first transaction at 12,150 yuan, an increase of 200 yuan. A certain gold shop sold a small amount at 12,100 yuan, which was then bought up by retail investors and another gold shop, pushing the price up to 12,200 yuan. Dacheng Yong and a certain securities firm sold, causing the price to fall back to 12,130 yuan. The initial market situation was quite unstable. Soon after, the upward trend suddenly gained momentum. Tongkangyong, Shunyuan, Wanfeng jewelry stores, and a certain gold shop, acting on behalf of clients, aggressively bought, pushing the price up by 400 yuan. At 11:32 AM, the price reached 12,550 yuan. Hefat sold on behalf of a certain Qianzhuang, and gold shops sold again, leading to a rush of selling by retail investors, which finally stopped the rise and caused the price to fall back to 12,370 yuan. The final transaction price at noon was 12,400 yuan, an increase of 450 yuan compared to the previous day. The price has risen for six consecutive days, with a total increase of 1,590 yuan. The daily range was 450 yuan, and the trading volume was still brisk. The price of jewelry gold at Daxin and other shops rose by 50 yuan at 11:00 AM, reaching 1,300 yuan per tael. Purchases decreased by 150 yuan. Silver was priced at 14 yuan, and the black market price was 10 yuan. There were already buyers, it was said.

Yesterday, the foreign exchange market saw a general rise. The price of British and American gold pounds rose by 20 yuan, with the former at 310 yuan and the latter at 320 yuan. The price of US dollar notes also rose to 16.75 and 16.8 yuan. Hong Kong notes remained at 2.8 yuan. Large notes decreased by a small amount. Military notes rose slightly to 3.9634 yuan.

### Government Bonds Soar, Foreign Stocks Mostly Rise

The government bond grey market continued to advance. Type C bonds surprisingly broke through 70 yuan. Investor sentiment became increasingly bullish and firm. There was no shortage of short sellers in the market who were gradually panicking and covering their positions. Small banks continued to buy. Market prices rose further, continuing to increase by one yuan. This has already equaled the price on November 17 of last year. However, on the 21st of that month, Type C bonds traded at 71.1 yuan. The prospects may be comparable to this high price. Type A bonds were priced at 74 yuan, with a high of 74.1 yuan. Type B bonds were priced at 71.5 yuan, with a high of 71.16 yuan. Type C bonds were priced at 70 yuan, with a high of 70.02 yuan. Type D bonds were priced at 66.1 yuan, with a high of 66.65 yuan. Type E bonds were priced at 68 yuan, with a high of 68.82 yuan. They all rose by seven or eight cents to one yuan. Yuxingchang, Jidingkang, Chengkang, and Tongyi bought, while Runde Yichang and Zhenchang Lianyi sold. The trading volume was approximately 600,000 to 700,000 yuan.

Yesterday's foreign stock market mostly rose. 14,300 shares of industrial and utility stocks were traded. Yangzi was priced at 10.05 yuan, Shanghai Wool at 5.8 yuan, Public Bus at 9.3 yuan, Tramway at 34 yuan, Telephone at 22 yuan, British Alliance at 19.3 yuan, Jardine Brewery at 5.5 yuan, Paper Industry at 5.5 yuan, rising to 5.85 yuan, then back to 5.8 yuan, Asian Shipping at 8.5 yuan, Ken Zhi initially at 21 yuan, rising to 22.5 yuan, Steel Industry initially at 15.3 yuan, then 15 yuan, and then back to 15.2 yuan, Kaiping at 30 yuan. Rubber traded over 2,000 shares, with Crohore initially at 1.9 yuan, then 2 yuan. Other stocks, such as Shanghai Bank, had sellers at 14 yuan, Zhongying had bids at 8.25 yuan and sales at 10 yuan, Xinhe Yarn had bids at 5.9 yuan and asking prices at 6.5 yuan, Zilai Fire at 8.5 yuan, Yeguang at 15 yuan, Zhongfang at 8.3 yuan, Wheelock Marden at 52 yuan, Kung Ho Hong at 140 yuan, Electricity Preferred at 80 yuan, Yinda District at 13.5 yuan, Yingzhahua at 21 yuan, Lan Gezhi at 14.4 yuan, and Rubber at 13 yuan. All had buyers and no sellers, it was said.

### National Rice Prices Rise Unceasingly

National rice prices are rising without end. Yesterday, northern and southern japonica rice increased by another six to seven yuan. Late rice opened at 235 to 238 yuan, while early rice reached 240 yuan. Northern Kunshan japonica rice rose to 255 yuan. Even the lowest-quality rice required 216 yuan. White Yuan surface prices were lower. Once dealers on this street inquired, prices also followed suit, increasing by five to six yuan. Jintan White Yuan rose to 2135 yuan. If the weather clears up, the source of national rice may increase. However, the output of the surrounding areas is limited, and the food prospects for the people are a cause for great concern.

The rice market will be closed for ten days for the Spring Festival, from the 9th to the 18th of the month. Real buying will resume on the 19th, it is said. Yesterday, rice bran made a comeback. Sanxin bran has already risen to 60 yuan.

### Miscellaneous Grains Remain Expensive

Corn prices continued to rise sharply when the market opened yesterday morning. Sellers were asking very high prices. However, as actual users found the prices too high, demand turned weak. Only speculators were buying. Therefore, the market situation slightly eased. The final result was roughly two to three yuan higher than the previous day. 100 bags of Holland white corn were priced at 56 yuan. 300 bags of Xigui new corn were priced at 62 to 63 yuan, and then reached 67 yuan. Yinghua Si had more than 400 tons of goods, with Hongkou warehouse goods priced at 88 to 89.5 yuan, and Hongsheng warehouse goods at 106 to 107 yuan.

Yellow beans were priced too high yesterday, and demand declined. However, the underlying trend remained firm. 20 bags of Tianjin new Jinyuan were sold at 153 yuan. Two cars of Wuhu yellow beans were priced at 130 yuan. 100 bags of Pudong Du beans were priced at 133 yuan. There were also a few sales of red beans at the same price. Ten bags of Chongming sand red beans were traded at 90 yuan.

The soybean cake market was firm. The price of soybeans was high, and market sentiment was bullish. Speculators were eager to buy. 3,000 pieces of Shengji soybean cake were sold, with May warehouse receipts priced at 26.9 to 27 yuan and June warehouse receipts at 28 yuan, an increase of about one yuan.

### Publicly Sold Sugar Awaits Delivery

Applications for sugar from retailers to the Public Sugar Sales Office totaled more than 50,000 bags. However, because there was not much stock of Taikoo granulated sugar, only half of the originally requested amount was supplied, so the actual number was about 40,000 bags. Furthermore, due to procedural issues, it will take another three or four days to open the warehouse and deliver the goods. Currently, there is an even greater shortage of spot goods. For example, both Dutch red sugar and cane red sugar are out of stock. The factory's cotton white sugar rose by about five yuan, granulated sugar rose by ten yuan for the top grade and five yuan for the lower grade.

### Citrus (3)

— Gao Jiannong

Especially with grafting, their varieties can be increased to infinity, so classifying them is very difficult and prone to disputes. Generally speaking, people can divide them into eight or nine types, including oranges, pomelos, citrons, etc., each with different shapes and forms. As for the most common characteristics of citrus, they are evergreen trees, ranging in height from one or two zhang to three or four zhang, with sharp and soft thorns growing on the stems. The leaves are about two cun long, oblong, pointed at the end, and either entire or with small, blunt serrations. They are green, glossy, and have oil-secreting glands that emit a fragrance. The petioles often have winged leaflets. The flowers are waxy white, with a refreshing fragrance. The petals range from four to eight, thick and fleshy, with three or five lobes. There is one pistil with a clearly visible stigma, which also secretes a white milky substance. There are many stamens, ranging from twenty to sixty, and they are connected to each other at the bottom, with only the filaments separated at the top, resembling a palm with several fingers sticking out. The pollen is a beautiful golden color and abundant. The flowers usually grow in the leaf axils, singly or in clusters in racemes. As for the fruits, they are the familiar and beloved "golden balls with jade-like liquid" of various sizes and colors that everyone knows. I don't think I need to describe them further to waste space.

What is the meaning of the two characters "citrus"? Li Shizhen explains the character "ju" (橘, mandarin orange) in the Compendium of Materia Medica: "Ju, derived from 矞 (yù, luxuriant), a phonetic loan. It is also said that five colors are auspicious, and two colors are luxuriant. It describes an image of outer red and inner yellow, neither smoke nor mist, lush and colorful. The fruit of the mandarin orange is outer red and inner yellow, and when cut open, fragrant mist rises, resembling luxuriant clouds. The derivation of ju from 矞 also takes this meaning." Zhang Ji of the Wei dynasty explains the character "gan" (柑, mandarin orange) in Guang Ya: "...before frost, the taste is sour; only after frost does it ripen and become sweet, hence the name based on taste." Zhu Meixi's commentary on poetry also says: "Other fruits are not without sweetness, but only the mandarin orange takes its name from sweetness, implying the most sweet." Although these explanations are somewhat far-fetched, they are also quite interesting, so I have copied them here. (To be continued)

### A Child's Heart — The Contradiction of Education

— Yu Ming

After the New Year, Ming'er will be eight years old.

Ming'er has a father and mother, and his mother and father love him very much. Every night, returning from the nightclub at twelve o'clock, his father and mother would gently stroke Ming'er's forehead before going to sleep.

However, every morning, when Ming'er finished his milk and bread, his father and mother would still be sound asleep, snoring loudly. So, Ming'er would tiptoe and go to school alone.

Thus, Ming'er doesn't have many opportunities to talk to his dad and mom, except on Sundays.

But one morning, his father woke up unusually early and seemed exceptionally happy. It turned out that his father had won money last night.

"Where's Ming'er?" His father asked the servant waiting on him, "Hasn't he gone to school yet?"

"Not yet, I think he's having a snack?"

"Ming'er, Ming'er!" So, his father called out happily, his voice kind and amiable, waking up his sleeping mother.

Ming'er hurried into the room, his little face looking very flustered, which made his father suspicious.

"Where were you?" As he spoke, his father carefully examined Ming'er. Suddenly, he noticed that the child's hands were stained with something that looked like white powder.

Ming'er was standing by his father's bed. His father took Ming'er's hands and asked strangely, "What's this?"

Instantly, a strange color appeared on the child's face, a color that Ming'er had never shown before his father and mother.

"It, it's..." The child's stuttering voice made his parents even more suspicious. Suddenly, his father noticed that the child's pockets were bulging. He reached into them and pulled out—rice, rice, rice!

"This, this, this—what are you doing?" His father was extremely surprised.

The child's small face flushed red, and he stared blankly. His father got out of bed, put on his pajamas, and ran to the rice storage room. He saw that among the stacked rice bags, one bag had a large hole cut in it, and a lot of rice was missing.

"Ming'er has been stealing rice more than once!" The father looked very angry. He stepped into the room, grabbed Ming'er's little hand, not knowing what to do. After all, his father loved Ming'er very much.

Ming'er started crying at this moment. As a result of his mother's quiet questioning, everyone learned that the child was taking the rice to give to his little friends at school.

The father never expected that his child would "fall" to this point. So, he opened the child's schoolbag and took out his books.

The first lesson in Ming'er's civics book was: "Be upright and honest in life, and do not do things that cause shame. Whether at home or at school, never take anything privately without informing your teachers and parents."

But the second lesson was: "We must help others, especially when they are in danger..."

Seventeen: A Final Destination

"Alright, since Third Brother has this intention, let's go quickly! Fortunately, we'll be back in an hour at most." Saying that, he turned around and gently patted Mei Bao on the shoulder twice. "Good girl, your father insists we go, so let's go...!"

Without waiting for Mei Bao to ask anything, the Han father and daughter, one in front and one behind, hurried and supported her out the door, not even having time to give Autumn Begonia another dose of medicine.

"Auntie, please pay a little more attention, we'll be right back." She finally felt uneasy, hurriedly turned around, and quietly instructed the old Mrs. Han a few words.

The old lady, of course, readily agreed. However, less than ten minutes after Mei Bao and the others left, the old lady once again leaned back in a large rattan chair and dozed off as usual. —For obese people over fifty years old, expecting them to stay awake after sitting down is as impossible as asking a rooster to lay eggs!

"Sister, my heart is beating very fast, let's go back after sitting in the Dragon Phoenix Restaurant for three or four minutes!" Mei Bao also knew very well that old Mrs. Han was unreliable, so she kept thinking about going back while walking on the road.

"It doesn't matter, your father seems very unwell today. My mother already said it during the day, so she will definitely be especially attentive now." The Han girl hurriedly comforted her. "Besides, your father has been sick for so many days, it's unlikely that something will suddenly happen today."

"In any case, let's go and come back quickly!" Old Han also felt very uneasy in his heart, so he sped up his pace while talking. In his opinion, there was no need to sing any plays or say other nonsense at the Dragon Phoenix Restaurant today. He would be honest and direct, and negotiate directly with that Luo fellow. If he truly had feelings for Mei Shi, everyone would rush back together to fulfill his wish before Autumn Begonia passed away. (327)

### The Stage and the Silver Screen

Yao Ke's contract with the Lyceum Theatre is scheduled to premiere on the first day of the Lunar New Year. The play will be "Chu Hegemon," with Shu Shi playing Xiang Yu and Yingzi playing Yu Ji.

The Shanghai Art Theatre Company will also stage "The Palace of Eternal Life" during the New Year according to the Gregorian calendar. From Wang Baochuan, Chu Hegemon, and Yang Guifei, it seems that the source of materials for spoken dramas will shift from fashion to historical costumes in the future.

It is said that there was quite a bit of contention over the new film for the Shanghai Guang Lunar New Year. The three question marks on yesterday's advertisement contain a double gimmick. Because those who are contending are "Sunny Day" and "Strange Woman," both films have three characters. With the outcome uncertain, the three question marks have their own logic. (Editor's note: It is rumored that "Sunny Day" may be renamed "Woman's Heart" (also three characters), but confirmation is pending.)

Ye Yifang's film "Moonlit Night" has been rushed for several consecutive nights and is about to be completed, it is said.

It is heard that Fox Film Company has a slapstick film starring Laurel and Hardy, titled "The Great Guns." The content is about the funny history of the two men joining the military. It was shipped to Shanghai before the outbreak of the Pacific War and will soon be released in Shanghai.

The Yun Sheng Ji ticket office is located in the Hebei Native Place Association in Shanghai on Fuxu Road. It was founded by Shan Ximian, Qin Lu, Fu Liang, and others. The biggest goal of the association is not only to provide a place for amateur entertainment, but also to carry out social charitable undertakings in the near future, it is said.

### About "Wang Baochuan"

— Zhong Ma

"Local is not hot," meaning that foreign goods are always more popular than local products. Therefore, the play "Wang Baochuan" is only so-so in China, but it became very popular in the UK. When it arrived in the United States, it became even more popular. This is not without reason, because Europe and America feel novelty about the traditional performance of Chinese drama. To put it more simply, they think our symbolic approach is simply—mysterious.

Western art is realistic, while Eastern art is symbolic. Therefore, our Chinese opera is symbolic drama.

If someone asks what is the consciousness of the script itself, "Wang Baochuan"? Forgive me for speaking frankly—it can be said that there is no consciousness, but only an attempt at a traditional style. It can also be said that it is "Chinese food eaten in the Western style!" This way, we may be subject to less criticism.

The script "Wang Baochuan" is a revised translation of Mr. Xiong Shiyi's English version. In order to maintain the original style, it is necessary to draw materials from Peking Opera. Recently, "Our Town," which was performed in the United States, used the symbolic techniques of our Chinese drama and was very popular. It can be seen that this path is not completely absurd.

Our Chinese "Wang Baochuan" has made a splash in the UK and the US, and is very popular. After this gilding returns, we cannot help but look at it differently. It is hard to say, maybe some people are not used to this style. In that case, I can only ask them to forgive me.

(The copper engraving shows the situation when "Wang Baochuan" was performed in London. The upper corner is Lan Lan, that is, what this article calls "our Chinese Wang Baochuan.")
