### Announcement from the Japanese Imperial Headquarters: Recent Naval Battle Results - Over 250,000 Tons of Enemy Ships Sunk

Tokyo, 7th (Domei News Agency) - The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 3:30 PM today that Japanese warships had sunk 21 enemy submarines from late July to late October. During the same period, the Japanese Navy sank 34 enemy ships, totaling 252,400 tons. The Japanese side only lost two submarines. The Japanese Imperial Headquarters also admitted that the Japanese side lost 29 merchant ships, totaling 122,500 tons, during the three months. According to military observers in Tokyo, as reported by Domei News Agency on the 7th, the Japanese military results announced by the Imperial Headquarters this afternoon included the sinking of 21 enemy submarines and 24 enemy ships, totaling 252,400 tons. Combined with the Japanese Navy's battle results since the start of the war, a total of 89 British and American submarines have been sunk and 39 damaged, totaling 128. In addition, a total of 391 ships have been sunk or damaged, approximately 220,000 tons. It is expected that most of the enemy submarines sunk in this announcement belong to the United States. Therefore, it can be estimated that the U.S. submarines have lost about 60 ships since the start of the war. Thus, most of the U.S. submarines in the Pacific have been lost, and those that remain are restricted by the Japanese Navy's control of the sea. Therefore, it will be impossible for the United States to implement a commerce raiding war in the Greater East Asia area. Most of the ships lost by Japan are transport ships in combat, and the loss of ships engaged in commerce is extremely minimal. From this, it can be seen that the Japanese army has established a strong and complete defense line in the Greater East Asia area against enemy submarine attacks. In the future, U.S. Navy submarines will have no room to be active under the power of the Japanese Navy. In addition, the number of enemy ships sunk by the Japanese Navy since the start of the war has reached 391, approximately 220,000 tons. Although this number is still small compared to the battle results of the German and Italian navies, the waters in which the Japanese Navy operates are much wider than those in which the German and Italian navies operate. The purpose of the Shanghai Naval operation is mainly to destroy the British and American maritime forces, and the commerce raiding war has no important position. Therefore, the focus of the Japanese Navy's operational goals is completely different from that of the German and Italian navies. Since the start of the war, the overall battle results of Japanese submarines have been very significant. The surprise attacks by submarines on Pearl Harbor, Sydney Harbor, and Madagascar, as well as the sinking of the USS Wasp and USS Hornet aircraft carriers by Japanese submarines, are all important battle results.

### Sino-Japanese Joint Celebration Night in the Capital: Minister Lin's Speech

Nanjing, 7th (Central News Agency) - The Sino-Japanese Joint Celebration Night, sponsored by the Propaganda Department and the Japanese Embassy, was held at the Grand China Theater at 7:30 PM today. Minister Lin personally attended and delivered a speech. The main idea was: "Tonight, the Japanese Embassy and the Propaganda Department are holding a celebration party here. I am deeply grateful for the enthusiastic participation of all officials and people from all walks of life. Originally, during the war, it is time for us to shed blood and sweat, not for singing and dancing. The reason why we are celebrating today is not for singing and dancing, but for another important meaning. First, today is the eighth anniversary of the Greater East Asia War. In the past year, the brave soldiers of the Allied Powers have achieved an absolute victory in the Greater East Asia War. This victory is not only the glory of the Allied Powers, but also the glory of the entire East Asia. We have today's celebration to show the bright future of East Asia to the people of both countries. Second, with the progress of the Greater East Asia War and the collapse of the Anglo-American aggressive forces, the success of the peace movement is determined. However, to win a thorough victory, we still need the continuous efforts and joint cooperation of the two major nations of China and Japan. We have today's celebration to continue our past efforts. We have today's celebration to step up our future cooperation. Third, the chairman often tells us that to cooperate in the Greater East Asia War, the people of East Asia must share weal and woe. To complete the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, the people of East Asia must love each other. During the war, we don't need to ask how to share weal in the future, but only ask how to share woe now. Only by being able to share woe can we talk about sharing weal. We have today's celebration with this spirit. Based on the above three points, we want to express our infinite respect to the heroic soldiers of the Greater East Asia War. We want to express our infinite sympathy to the majority of hardworking and resilient people. We must have the same brave and diligent spirit as the soldiers to fight. We must have the same hardworking and resilient spirit as the people to work hard. We must expand today's celebration in continuous efforts and continuous struggles, and make it a grand celebration held simultaneously by 550 million people in China and Japan."

### East of Mersa Matruh, German and Italian Forces Counterattacked Several Times: Armored Forces on Both Sides Fiercely Engaged; Genoa, Italy Bombed the Night Before Last

Berlin, 7th (Domei News Agency) - Fierce fighting continues east of Mersa Matruh in Egypt. German General Rommel and British General Alexander's armored forces are fiercely engaged. Although the Axis forces have been subjected to fierce attacks by British tanks and infantry, they are still maintaining an unbroken line. The British side claims that the Axis forces have been driven back, while here it is announced that the Axis heavy bomber squadrons have continuously bombed the British motorized units between Mersa Matruh and El Alamein, inflicting heavy damage. Informed sources here say that the British claim that a large amount of German and Italian military equipment has been destroyed and captured is absurd. General Rommel is withdrawing from the El Alamein positions according to a pre-determined plan. When the German army withdrew from the old positions on the nights of November 3rd and 4th, only unusable war equipment, heavy artillery, and other military equipment were left behind. The artillery had been moved to the new positions to bombard the British army. The Axis forces are still outnumbered on land and in the air, so reinforcements have begun to arrive. There are no continuous lines on the current front. The fighting is currently taking place along a 60-mile front from north to south.

Fuhrer Headquarters, 7th (DNB) - Today's German military report states that fierce fighting continues in Egypt. German and Italian troops counterattacked, inflicting heavy losses on enemy tank formations. German and Italian air forces in batches attacked enemy mechanized units between Mersa Matruh and El Alamein. The anti-aircraft guns of German warships shot down five enemy aircraft in the Mediterranean in recent days. A few British planes, under cover of floating clouds, flew into western Germany and harbors yesterday during the day. The damage to the people was very small. Six enemy aircraft were shot down.

Rome, 7th (DNB) - Today's Italian military headquarters communique states that operations continued yesterday east of Mersa Matruh. The Axis forces counterattacked several times, inflicting heavy damage on enemy tanks. Our aircraft attacked the airfields on Malta several times last night. British aircraft bombed Genoa last night, causing greater damage to the eastern part of the city. Twenty civilians were killed and fifty were injured. However, the general public observed discipline and the order was quite good. Only one enemy bomber was shot down.

Bern, Switzerland, 6th (Domei News Agency) - Regarding the fighting in North Africa, the London military believes that the first phase of the large-scale offensive launched by General Alexander has come to an end. It will take some time to see how it develops in the future. Since the battle has changed from trench warfare to mobile warfare, General Rommel has been known as an expert in mobile warfare in the Axis countries. Therefore, the final outcome should be judged carefully and not be too optimistic. Moreover, although the British army has won, the German and Italian forces on the Egyptian front have not completely collapsed, and their retreat is a planned one.

### German Reinforcements for North Africa - Constructing Two Lines of Defense

London, 6th (Havas) - According to semi-official sources, the Axis countries are currently sending a large number of reinforcements to North Africa. In addition to multiple trains full of troops seen in Greece, troops are also about to depart from Sicily and Genoa in Italy. It is estimated that the strength of all the reinforcements is at least four divisions.

Berlin, 7th (DNB) - German military figures pointed out that the German and Italian air forces are able to continuously bomb North Africa, which proves that fresh troops have flown in to help. But we cannot assume that the German and Italian air forces have gained the upper hand in Egypt, because there are more British planes than ever before. It is estimated that the British Eighth Army is larger than the British army that went to France in 1940. However, the British claim that the Allied forces in North Africa number no less than one million is doubtful.

Stockholm, Sweden, 7th (DNB) - According to British sources in London, the fighting in the El Daba area is still going on. This morning's news from Cairo states that the British army has occupied the landing place of Fuka. It is reported that the landing place of El Daba has also been occupied. The British army has also crossed the El Daba defense line. Military circles in Cairo believe that Marshal Rommel has built two defense lines in the past two months to protect Libya. The first line of defense starts east of Mersa Matruh, passes through the Libyan plain, and reaches the Siwa Oasis. The second line of defense is based on the Halfaya Pass and extends to the south of the Siwa Oasis.

### Western Caucasus, German Troops Fight in the Rain - Soviet Reinforcements in the Terek Area; Street Fighting in Stalingrad Still Fierce

Fuhrer Headquarters, 7th (DNB) - Today's German military report states that in the western Caucasus, our army launched a surprise attack and repelled the enemy on a certain high ground. German infantry north of Tuapse made progress in the rain. East of Alagir, the enemy counterattacked several times. German aircraft destroyed 30 Soviet tanks and an armored train. German reconnaissance bombers attacked Soviet troops advancing along the Georgian Military Road. There were only local battles in the Stalingrad area. Our dive bombers attacked enemy artillery positions east of the Volga River. Our suicide squads destroyed many enemy bunkers in the central sector. German aircraft bombed enemy concentrations in the Volga River and Vinnitsa River areas.

Rome, 7th (Havas) - According to reports here, the resistance of the Soviet army in the Terek area of the Caucasus has been strengthened, and fresh troops are constantly arriving. Special forces are busy building fortifications at night.

Stockholm, Sweden, 7th (Havas) - The German-Soviet war has lasted 72 weeks, and there are no major changes. In the Stalingrad area, a large number of German reinforcements have arrived in recent days, and the air force has also stepped up bombing. Street fighting in the city is still very fierce, but there are no large-scale battles on either side.

### Fighting on the Island of Madagascar has Ended - Both Sides are Negotiating a Treaty

Stockholm, Sweden, 7th (DNB) - London formally announced yesterday that the British High Command has agreed to an armistice with the French Governor-General of Madagascar. An official statement issued here states that the War Office announces that at the request of the French Governor-General of Madagascar, hostilities ceased at 2:00 PM on November 5th. The armistice agreement has been signed by both sides, and the battle of Madagascar has come to a smooth end.

Vichy, 6th (Havas) - The French Cabinet held a state council meeting today, chaired by Marshal Petain. The head of government, Laval, reported on the course of the fighting on the island of Madagascar and explained the difficulties faced by the island's garrison, saying, "The French army on the island has fought to the last breath, but the greatness of their spirit of sacrifice has been fully demonstrated and is worthy of the respect and admiration of the people across the country." After the meeting, officials confirmed that hostilities on the island of Madagascar had ceased and that negotiations for an armistice agreement had begun.

Vichy, 6th (Havas) - The French garrison on the island of Madagascar was in dire straits and had no choice but to request an armistice. Marshal Petain, upon hearing the news, immediately sent a telegram to Governor Annet of the island, saying, "The government has complete confidence in you. Your actions are like those of a glorious and resistant warrior. Do not accept any conditions of a political nature." The government also decided to award the War Cross to Annet and the garrison commander, General Guillemet.

### A Squadron of British Warships Sails into the Mediterranean

Bern, Switzerland, 6th (Havas) - According to news from Berlin, a large squadron of British warships, including several aircraft carriers, sailed from Gibraltar into the Mediterranean last night.

Algeciras, 7th (DNB) - Yesterday, a large convoy flying British and American flags sailed from the Atlantic through the Strait of Gibraltar into the Mediterranean at 5:00 PM. The convoy included 24 merchant ships, including several oil tankers and troop transports. Two oil tankers, three destroyers, and four flat-bottomed battleships joined the convoy at that port. The battleship HMS Rodney sailed away from the port yesterday morning under the protection of fighter planes. Shortly thereafter, 16 fighter planes flew to the port from the Atlantic.

Algeciras, 7th (DNB) - According to news received here, the Gibraltar authorities have ordered the detention of ships, motorboats, and sailboats. Naval exercises were held in Gibraltar yesterday afternoon. There are currently four aircraft carriers anchored in the port.

### Stalin's Radio Address on the Anniversary of the Soviet October Revolution - Strongly Argues that Britain and the United States Should Open a Second Front and Explains the Goals of the Current War Against Germany

Moscow, 7th (Domei News Agency) - In a radio address to the nation yesterday on the 25th anniversary of the Soviet Revolution, Stalin again argued that Britain and the United States should open a second front in Europe. He said that if Britain and the United States could launch a second front on the European continent within the year, they would be able to draw 60 German divisions from the Soviet side and 20 divisions from their allies, thereby preventing the German army from winning on the Eastern Front. In the Egyptian sector, only four divisions of the German army are being restrained and 11 divisions of the Italian army, while the Soviet side has a total of 240 divisions of the Axis forces. In the last world war, there were two fronts in Europe, east and west, but in this European war, there is no second front, so the ratio of enemy and our forces is two to one. The suffering of the Red Army and the magnitude of the sacrifices can be imagined. In short, the second front must be realized, not because of our needs, but also because it is necessary for our allies. As for the German plan to fight in southern Soviet Union, the original goal was to encircle the Soviet army and isolate it from Moscow. The German army's attack on the Soviet oil-producing areas was not its main goal, but only a side effect. Because the German army has no worries, it can concentrate all its forces and win a major victory on the Eastern Front. If Britain and the United States could open a second front as in the last world war, the situation on the Soviet side would definitely take a sharp turn for the better. In the last world war, Germany had a total of 220 army divisions, of which only 85 divisions were used to fight against Russia, plus 27 divisions of the Austro-Hungarian army, three divisions of the Bulgarian army, and three divisions of the Turkish army. In September this year, according to accurate records, of the 256 German divisions, 179 divisions were used to deal with the Soviet Union, plus 20 divisions of the Romanian army, 14 divisions of the Finnish army, 10 divisions of the Italian army, 13 divisions of the Hungarian army, one division of the Slovak army, and one division of the Spanish army, totaling 240 divisions. Compared with Napoleon's invasion of Russia, the strength of the forces is also very different. Napoleon invaded Russia with an army of 600,000 people, and no more than 300,000 to 400,000 people reached Borodino, and no more than this number reached Moscow. Now the Red Army is dealing with more than three million people and is equipped with the latest weapons. Stalin elaborated that the goals of the enemy and our armies in this war are completely opposite. Our operational policy is to crush the new order in Europe.

Moscow, 6th (Central News Agency) - Stalin delivered a radio address to the nation at Red Square here on the evening of the 6th, first reviewing the achievements of the Soviet Union on the front line in the past year. He said, "The activities of the Soviet government in the past year have focused on organizing the domestic front and the Red Army's operations. In terms of domestic industry, it has been moved to the east, the area of cultivation has also been expanded, and the discipline of rear workers has also been strengthened. Therefore, the organization within the country can be said to be sound."

### Africa in the Midst of Shifting Winds: The Independent Nation of Liberia, Founded by Eighty Freed Slaves (Part 2)

This place was originally a small British West African territory called Sierra Leone. The expedition team sent a few representatives ashore to take a look, but they felt something was amiss. On the one hand, their fellow countrymen were too uncivilized, refusing even to wear trousers; on the other hand, the white landowners on shore were treating the local black people worse than animals; those who had already regained their freedom were certainly unwilling to be whipped again. They would rather die in the sea.

After a discussion among the eighty people, they decided to sail further south, willing to go to a place where no one had set foot and fight for their lives against lions and crocodiles. As fate would have it, they found a small island at the mouth of the Mano River, which had all kinds of trees, flowers, and fruits, only lacking human care. The eighty people, old and young, landed here and named the island Paradise Island.

While living on this small island, they also explored the mainland across the river, and discovered that the Mano River basin could indeed be a place for great achievements, so they moved a portion of the people there. This is the Mesurado Cape, which is now the capital of Liberia, Monrovia. The following year, the black slaves in the United States heard this news and were greatly encouraged, and two thousand men, women, and children crossed the ocean to come. Two thousand was indeed a large number, and the newly discovered place, even after being developed, could not accommodate them all, so another group was organized to head south along the coast, hoping to find a place where they could settle down.

This group of people walked and lived along the way, spending eleven or twelve years (1833), roughly walking more than three hundred miles, and found a good piece of land at Cape Palmas, which they named "Maryland in Africa." This free area later prospered, and in 1857, it was finally decided to merge into Liberia and be called Maryland County.

What is the origin of the name Liberia? It turns out that in the second year after the eighty people discovered the capital Monrovia (1824), a missionary named Gurley saw that the area was lush and green, with flowers and fruits everywhere, and with inspiration, he named it Liberia. The first five letters of the word spell "liber" in French, which means "free." (Phonetically, it should be translated as "Lai Bei Li Ya" to avoid confusion with the Italian territory of Libya).

In fact, this land was not exactly a new discovery by free black slaves. In the fourteenth century, a Portuguese explorer had been here and drawn a map, so many of the old place names still in use today are of Portuguese origin. In the fifteenth century, Portuguese merchants also came, and in the sixteenth century, exploration teams from England, the Netherlands, Germany, and France came one after another, driving away the Portuguese who had first discovered the area.

Since the free black people arrived in Liberia, black people have continued to migrate from the United States every year, with the largest number being more than three thousand. Within twenty-five years, most of the people on Paradise Island and in the capital were under the management of the British, while those in the free area of Maryland were truly self-governing.

In 1841, when the last white official died, an outstanding talent, a pure black man named Roberts, took office. At this time, Liberia was not yet a country, nor was it an official colony of any country; it was just a free area for black slaves. But because it did not have an official name, it was difficult to handle all affairs. What was especially hateful was that there were often conflicts between the British and French colonies on the borders of the area, often involving negotiations, and often breaking out into fights. In addition, within this free area, there were many indigenous tribes who often caused trouble for them. Throughout the year, things like this happened every day.

The black leader Roberts, although not one of the original eighty pioneers, was indeed a member of one of their families. He graduated from the black university in Virginia, the state best known for its tobacco; although he was not a specialized talent or a famous scholar, he was indeed worthy of being the leader of the entire free area in terms of learning and knowledge. As for his spirit, courage, and great talent, he was indeed extraordinary.

The free area had such an incredible figure, and seized the right opportunity to enter the political arena, so of course he was going to make a big difference. In the first six years, all his energy was devoted to internal stability and external resistance. Internal stability meant subduing several leading barbarian tribes and getting them to submit. External resistance meant directly negotiating with the colonial powers of England and France.

In 1847, everything was handled quite well in terms of political affairs and foreign affairs, so with a thunderclap from the ground, the free area officially declared the establishment of the Republic of Liberia. All political organizations and laws were modeled after the United States; at the same time, a passionate declaration of independence was drafted; a rough translation of the main points is as follows:

We, the citizens of Liberia, are all originally citizens of the United States of North America.

During our time as citizens of that country, in certain regions, we were unable to obtain the rights that human beings should have; in other regions, the customs of the people, which had more power than the law, looked down on us to the extreme.

Everywhere that calls itself a place of civilization, we are excluded.

We have no say in any administration.

We are not allowed to express our opinions on taxation and levies.

We are oppressed horizontally, and although we offer our products, we receive no national protection.

We are distinguished as a special ethnic group, and we have no right to enjoy any improvements, while other foreign ethnic groups with different skin colors from us are given priority in everything.

We have repeatedly appealed, but have been ignored, or even dismissed on the pretext of special organizations.

Our hard work and hope have finally been shattered; what hangs before our future is only depravity.

Since landing on the coast of Africa, we have been able to freely admire a glimmer of light in our future, hoping that we can develop the personality of human beings endowed by nature; nurture our sincere and upwardly mobile fire; develop the inspiration given to us by the creator; and show those who have always looked down on, mocked, and oppressed us that we are the same round-headed, square-footed beings, with the same natural gifts; and that we can also obtain the cultivation of a refined nature, and also obtain the evolution that decorates so-called noble human beings....

Discovered Paradise Island.

### Authorities Determined to Suppress Commodity Prices. Public Announcement Addressed to Citizens. Calling for Citizen Cooperation and Encouraging Production, Discouraging Speculation and Excessive Profits in Order to Stabilize Prices.

Yesterday, the Shanghai Municipal Council of the International Settlement and the French Municipal Council jointly issued a public announcement addressed to citizens regarding commodity price controls. It stated, "Now, in order to stabilize commodity prices and ensure the well-being of the people, we specially call on citizens to cooperate. Although the authorities can find ways to control commodity prices, this matter requires the cooperation and understanding of citizens to be effective. The harms of rising commodity prices are well known to the public. If the trend of rising prices is not curbed, not only will the wage-earning class experience great difficulties, but the economic foundation of this city will also be shaken. Whenever commodity prices rise beyond the affordability of the general wage-earning class, social and physical harms will follow, and their impact will be obvious. Therefore, the rise in commodity prices, if not checked, will always be a source of social unrest."

Credit Loans; Encouraging Production

The true key point of our research into economic problems is the purchasing power of money. Therefore, our actions must be determined by whether their impact can increase or decrease the purchasing power of money. When commodity prices rise, the purchasing power of money decreases. For example, if a person has 1,000 yuan to buy goods, and the price of the goods doubles, their money will also double to 2,000 yuan. But at this time, the 2,000 yuan they obtain has the same purchasing power as the previous 1,000 yuan, or even less. On the authorities' side, there are currently plans for various methods, such as credit loans, limited to production enterprises, and encouraging major industries, etc., to improve the situation.

Focus on Investment; Do Not Engage in Speculation

On the citizens' side, the following items can also be implemented for cooperation: (1) focus on the operation of production enterprises; (2) individual purchases should be limited to practical and essential items; (3) do not hoard any goods; (4) rather than engaging in the distribution of manufactured products, focus on investing in genuine production enterprises; (5) do not engage in speculation in goods and stocks to seek excessive profits; (6) carefully study various investments based on the previous ratio of dividends and profits, and do not rely on impressions and rumors. Before investing, you should also carefully check the company's balance sheet and profit and loss statement. If citizens can implement the above methods, not only will rising commodity prices be suppressed, but also the wealth they already possess and will obtain in the future will be protected.

### Issuance of Purchase Certificates for Restaurants and Wine Shops Temporarily Suspended

The Shanghai Edible Oil Industry Wholesale Department has finalized an order for 500 tons (equivalent to 10,000 dan). In addition, retail stores began selling their stock yesterday. Such lines can be seen at edible oil stores on Xiamen Road, Fujian Road, Tiantong Road, and Baker Road. Therefore, citizens do not seem to need to worry excessively about edible oil at present.

Oil Purchase Certificates; Suspended This Month

The Edible Oil Industry Wholesale Department, regarding the item "Restaurants and Wine Shops Receive Oil Purchase Certificates" published in various newspapers yesterday, stated to the Datong News Agency reporter with great emphasis that, as there are discrepancies with the facts, in order to avoid misunderstandings from the outside world, the issuance of oil purchase certificates for restaurants and wine shops began several months ago. Starting this month, due to the insufficient supply of edible oil, the authorities of the wholesale department issued a notice temporarily suspending the issuance.

500 Tons of Oil; Scheduled for Distribution

According to the person in charge of the Edible Oil Industry Wholesale Department, the 500 tons of edible oil that has been finalized has made headway in moving permits. It is expected that it will be distributed to retail stores for sale next Tuesday or Wednesday. However, in order to avoid hoarding and creating black markets, the initial distribution volume is temporarily set at 1,000 to 2,000 dan.

### Air Defense Exercises; Continued Exercises Starting Today

Since the highest air defense authority in this city announced that large-scale blackout exercises would be held again starting on the 8th of this month, all districts of the city have paid close attention and have held local exercises one after another. Yesterday, for the sake of caution, the Lianbao chiefs of the two concessions issued notices separately, with roughly similar wording. It is noted that the large-scale air defense exercise in this city will be held again starting tomorrow, or warning exercises may be held at any time without prior notice. Therefore, residents must pay attention to the sound of the air raid siren at all times, and pay extra attention to covering up all lights. The police authorities have dispatched detectives to patrol in sections, and residents who violate the rules will be severely punished.

### Shanghai Municipal Council; Continued Distribution of Butter

The Shanghai Municipal Council recently issued a notice stating that butter can be purchased from designated stores with coupon number 11 from the 9th to the 14th of this month. Australian butter is priced at 30 yuan per pound, and Qingdao butter is priced at 25 yuan per pound.

### Shanghai Russians; Commemorate the October Revolution; Two Factions with Completely Different Attitudes

The English-language "China Press" reports that the more than 2,000 Russians in Shanghai are today (the 7th) commemorating the 25th anniversary of the Soviet October Revolution in vastly different ways. Soviet expatriates are celebrating joyously, while White Russians are banning entertainment and praying for the end of Communist rule. Both the Soviet and White Russian newspapers in Shanghai have special editions today. The former is filled with photographs of Soviet leaders and the country's war efforts, as well as texts commemorating this great Soviet holiday. The White Russian newspaper has a large headline, "Day of Sorrow for Russians," and the entire page of the White Russian Shanghai "Chara" newspaper is surrounded by a thick black border and contains anti-Soviet texts, such as the assassination of Tsar Nicholas II and his family.

### Guangdong Fellow Countrymen's Dissolution Meeting; Last Batch Going South This Morning

The last batch of fellow countrymen from Guangdong traveling back to their hometowns, organized by the Guangdong Shanghai Association Dissolution Meeting, will depart this morning after repeated negotiations by the association. With this, the association's business will be declared completely over. Once the accounts are settled clearly and audited by an accountant, they will be printed and published as a credit record, distributed to all fellow countrymen for verification and to show fairness. The association was established in March of this year, and within eight months, it has sent nine batches of unemployed fellow countrymen back to their hometowns, totaling 800 people, benefiting the unemployed in their hometowns, which can indeed be said to be no small feat.

### Exorbitant Black Market Profits Have Yet to Be Curtailed; Thorough Elimination Is Urgently Needed; Swift and Severe Action Is Required to Prevent the Resurgence of Speculation in Various Commodities

The English-language "Shanghai Times" reports that, according to a recent investigation by reporters, although the municipal authorities have enacted various regulations and trade associations are attempting to curb the evils of hoarding, the trend of hoarding and speculation in sugar, oil, rice, and meat has not yet been curtailed. Therefore, the citizens of Shanghai are now demanding that the authorities take immediate and severe action to completely eliminate black market activities in food.

Hoarding and Excessive Profits; Should Be Severely Punished

All Shanghai newspapers, whether Chinese, Japanese, English, or Russian, are clearly aware of the seriousness of the situation faced by citizens and are unanimously supporting the movement to crack down on hoarding and excessive profits, and pointing out that the authorities must take swift and severe action to prevent the intensification of speculation in various commodities. Some people even advocate that hoarders and profiteers should be punished with the utmost severity, and at the same time, the current food distribution system should be reorganized to adapt to current needs. According to general opinion, the most important reorganization step is to establish a per capita rationing system to distribute various foods. The police are currently closely monitoring the issue of controlled foods, and the public welcomes any announcements by the authorities regarding controlled foods.

Black Market Activities; Have Yet to Be Curtailed

At the beginning of this year, Chinese and foreign citizens were still suspicious of the authorities' plan to ration rice, flour, bread, and butter per capita. Now, they are eager for all daily necessities to be distributed through a per capita rationing system. The discovery of black market activities in the buying and selling of items such as rice, sugar, oil, and meat has aroused serious concern among the public. Although the authorities are making every effort to promote a low-price policy, the black market prices of food are constantly rising, and sugar and oil are already in short supply. So far, the rationing of sugar and oil has been handled separately by the Shanghai Sugar Merchants Cooperative and the Oil Merchants Wholesale Department. The situation of sugar has not improved since the beginning of this month. As for vegetable oil, the Oil Merchants Wholesale Department is now taking strong measures to prevent the same situation from occurring in vegetable oil transactions.

Why Is There a Shortage of Edible Oil?

According to people from all walks of life interviewed by reporters yesterday (the 6th), even if the authorities allocate the minimum amount of sugar and oil, it would be better than the current method of lining up to buy half a pound of sugar. Over the past two weeks, Chinese newspapers have been reporting daily on the black market prices of food. For example, the price of rice along the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway is 250 yuan, while the price of rice in Shanghai has tripled (rice rationed per capita is not included in this example). According to well-informed sources, the daily distribution of 1,000 dan of vegetable oil is not only sufficient to meet the needs of the residents of the two concessions, but also to meet the legitimate needs of residents in the western district and Pudong. Of the approximately 2,000 oil shops in Shanghai, 400 are suspected of engaging in speculation, which has led to higher oil prices. Some of these black market speculators are currently not being allocated vegetable oil.

Thorough Control; Per Capita Rationing

As for sugar, although the Shanghai Sugar Merchants Cooperative has repeatedly announced that stocks are sufficient, hoarders and speculators continue to be active, and the public has not been able to obtain the sugar they need daily. With regard to meat, the authorities issued a price limit on October 11, but very few food shops and vendors complied with the price limit when selling meat. The pork market situation was quite bad about six weeks ago, but it has improved slightly since then, but not completely. And the market price of beef and mutton is also openly higher than the price limit. Since unscrupulous merchants disregard official regulations, the public is even more urgently demanding a thorough control and per capita rationing system for all foods.

### The Masses Are Re-publishing Books

The "Public" monthly magazine, founded by the contemporary erudite scholar Qian Xumi, sold out within three days of its premiere on the 1st of this month. Distribution points in Shanghai and other places have requested additional copies, so an additional edition was immediately printed and released yesterday. The content is wonderful, and it has a good reputation. The whole book is 250 pages and sells for 5 yuan. The office is located at No. 48, Lane 228, Baker Road, phone number 91131. The distributors are Wuzhou Pictorial Society, and the distributors are Huxi, Bai Peng Chunming, Zhongxi, and Qiuyi.

### Record of an Interview with Mr. Xia Jingguan

The old seniors in the literary and academic circles, in the present day, are as sparse as the morning stars. The countable ones are the five old gentlemen Jin (Songcen), Li (Bake), and Qian (Mingshan), and Chen (Hecai). Some are known for their classical Chinese, others for their poetry. But besides poetry and prose, the one who can write and paint is Mr. Xia Jingguan.

At the extreme west of Avenue Joffre, a place called "Jingcun," I met two old men with flowing white beards. When I arrived, they had probably been quietly wielding their brushes and ink, busy with their art. After readjusting their clothes, they slowly came out to meet me. At that time, Mr. Xia put down his pen and chatted with me. He had unique insights on politics, society, science, and all kinds of knowledge, and was by no means as stubborn as ordinary people. He pointed me to a completed painting under a corner of the bright window. It had faint peaks and sparse forests, and was inscribed with twenty-four characters: "In a world of great peace, people do not travel to and fro, new houses are built, leaning against the mountains, dogs bark sparsely, and roosters crow harmoniously." A kind of unattainable ancient style seemed to awaken my tired soul, which had just swallowed a full "world of dust." He told me that he always leaned over this corner of the bright window to wield his brush for an entire morning. As soon as one piece was finished, another would come next, it was a bit overwhelming. He is not an ordinary artist, he is a famous veteran in the literary world, a craftsman in the art world. From November 6th, at the urging of his friends, he held a painting exhibition at the Ningbo Fellow Countrymen Association for three days, and today is the last day.

Jingcun, how fortunate to have this noble and old gentleman residing there. "Only through purity and quiet can one travel freely in the spirit," this is the meaning of Yang Ziyun's "Mystery," perhaps he loves Jingcun for this reason! I thought. (Huazi)

Yesterday's newspaper reporting time was 6:40 PM

### Summer Goods: Woolen Fabrics ‚Äì Speculation and Trading

Yesterday, the woolen fabric market saw significant progress, mainly due to the Zhuma Company's high-priced purchases of grass-green broadcloth and serge. Merchants from Nanjing, Xuzhou, and Bengbu showed slight interest. Simultaneously, favorable buying news spread frequently. With the first ten days of the month passed, buyers began to take action, leading to a surge in both retail and wholesale transactions. Consumer confidence rebounded, and prices began to rise. Flannel, palis, white drills, white serge, "Guang Huo" (plain weave) spring light tweed, summer gauze and rubberized fabrics, and similar items from various brands were successively acquired by major wholesalers in the industry. As a result, market sentiment improved significantly, with prices rising and shortages appearing.

### Beans Remain in Demand

The arrival of beans has been delayed for a long time, and the allocation of goods is also scarce, resulting in high demand and prices. About ten bags of Pudong Du beans were traded at a price of 280 yuan.

The supply and demand of bean cakes are relatively balanced, and there are no significant price changes. 500 pieces of Changji bean cake were traded at 72 yuan and 7.5 jiao. One cart of Yuanlong bean cake was 76 yuan, and two carts for delivery in two weeks were 74 yuan and 7.5 jiao to 74 yuan and 5 jiao.

### Gold and Silver Ornaments Remain Weak

The jewelry gold price quoted by large silver firms such as Daxin Tonghang at the storefront was initially 2,650 yuan per tael. At 9:30 AM, it dropped by 50 yuan to 2,600 yuan (buy-back price reduced by approximately 300 yuan). The inter-dealer price remained weak, opening 30 yuan lower at 2,340 yuan.

### "Shuang Ma" Factory Receipts ‚Äì Trading Vanishes

The yarn market has recently experienced rapid and unpredictable fluctuations, causing anxiety and fear. Previously, due to the higher price of current yarn in the Beijing-Shanghai Railway area, speculators became very active, and buyers were even more crowded. Under these circumstances, the market price soared, breaking through the 7,000 yuan mark. At this time, short sellers, unable to cover their margin calls, began to falter. In particular, one company, with a large number of short positions, was unable to cover and was forced to close down, causing significant market turmoil. Simultaneously, news of stricter government control further unsettled those with long positions. The market price suddenly reversed, plummeting from over 7,000 yuan to 6,500 yuan, with a low of 6,430 yuan. Today, the Shanghai Municipal Council issued a notice strictly prohibiting trading in "Shuang Ma" factory receipts, with penalties for violations. As a result, trading in "Shuang Ma" factory receipts ceased immediately. The previously transacted amounts were generally settled at a price of 6,600 yuan to finalize the transactions, although most have not yet been accepted.

### Black Melon Seeds: Slight Easing in the Beijing Market

According to a quick letter from Nanjing yesterday, prices for black melon seeds showed a slight easing, but the amount was very small and still difficult to transfer to Shanghai. Xu Da Pian Zi (Xu large slice seeds) were priced at 840 yuan, Tongcheng Zi (Tongcheng seeds) at 720-730 yuan, Wuhe Zi (Wuhe seeds) at 580 yuan, and Linhuai Zi (Linhuai seeds) at 560 yuan.

### Fleeceflower Root: Slightly Increased Offer

The previous arrival of guest goods (fleeceflower root) has been held up until now due to unmet offers. Yesterday, the market offered slightly increased bids, only about 20 yuan higher than before, still under negotiation and potentially leading to a transaction.

### Cigarettes, Soap, and Candles: Prices Fall

The market prices of cigarettes, matches, soap, and candles are all trending downwards. This is largely due to the tight credit conditions affecting all goods, causing them to decline successively. The cigarette market price has been difficult to stabilize, following the downward trend. British brands fell to 9,000 yuan, Old Knife brand to 8,000 yuan, Pin Hai to 7,900 yuan, Fairy brand to 7,150 yuan, and Wuhua brand to 7,000 yuan, a decrease of 100-200 yuan compared to the previous day. Japanese cigarettes: Golden Gun brand at 3,150 yuan, Golden Building at 3,500 yuan, Quanlu brand at 3,250 yuan, Compass brand at 2,700 yuan, Beauty brand at 5,400 yuan, and Golden Mouse brand at 3,900 yuan, Pyramid at 6,250 yuan all showing weakness. Phoenix brand matches at 2,500 yuan, Gubensao soap at 395 yuan, Huangxiangmao soap at 290 yuan, and Arrow Knife soap at 260 yuan, also down slightly less than ten yuan.

### Rayon Also Trending Down

Recently, the rayon market has also been trending downward due to the decline in yarn and cloth prices. No. 120 Tianqiao (Sky Bridge) bright silk opened at 7,380 yuan yesterday morning, closing at 7,400 yuan, down 85 yuan from the previous day. Xuhui was at 7,400 yuan, Jin San Ma (Golden Three Horses) at 7,465 yuan, Toyo at 7,200 yuan, Silver Bird at 7,340 yuan, Fuji at 7,150 yuan, and No. 150 Golden Ring Star at 7,200 yuan, No. 75 Golden Chicken semi-gloss at 5,800 yuan.

### Foreign Silver Dollars and Square Ingots Stable

Recently, there has been no improvement in sales of new foreign silver dollars and square ingots. Guest merchants have lost interest, and local manufacturers and users are also showing little interest, so the market price has not fluctuated much. New foreign silver dollars and square ingots are selling for 12,000 yuan per ton, with a slight premium for different patterns.

### Tinplate Continues to Increase

Yesterday, the local yarn factory used rolling machines to search for more than ten sheets of No. 24 and No. 26 tinplate, and the market atmosphere inevitably revived. Standard asking prices continued to increase. Currently, No. 24 pattern is offered at 160 yuan per sheet, and No. 26 goods at 140 yuan.

### Enthusiastically Participate in the Winter Clothing Drive

‚Äî Hua

Cold weather is the most threatening season for impoverished compatriots. They are plagued by hunger and cold, and it is truly difficult for them to survive. This is proven by the annual statistics of people freezing to death on the streets.

We experienced a scorching summer this year, and we anticipate an exceptionally cold winter. Thinking of our impoverished compatriots, we cannot help but worry about them, because everyone has compassion.

However, unorganized relief efforts also have significant drawbacks. Now there is an opportunity for us to fulfill our responsibility of human mutual assistance, because the YWCA is launching a winter clothing drive, with five ways to participate. In addition to donating money or labor, we can also donate unused old clothes and socks to the YWCA.

While taking care of our own winter preparations, participating in the winter clothing drive is arguably the most meaningful work we can do right now.

### The Greatest Happiness is Doing Good

‚Äî Mrs. Huang Zuoting, Huang Xuepa

The happiest person in the world is not the one with a house full of gold or lofty fame, but the one who can build their own happiness on the happiness of others, helping others everywhere and working diligently for the happiness of others.

The YWCA's annual winter clothing drive is about to begin again. Perhaps in these difficult times, you may feel "powerless" to contribute to these good deeds. However, I believe that you and I are still living a happy family life with plenty of food and clothing, which is much happier than the many people suffering from hunger and cold in the icy and snowy weather. As long as we slightly economize on our personal and family daily expenses, we can accumulate a small amount into a large sum, which is enough to sew thin cotton clothes for these many starving and freezing people.

"The greatest happiness is doing good." Please donate generously!

### Twenty Letters from the Ge Family

‚Äî Translated by Xu Baiyi

Mr. Ge Laiheng's son was once again promoted, from an accounting clerk to a traveling salesman, and set off to another city. Mr. Ge Laiheng did not have a good impression on the day of his departure, so he immediately wrote a letter to give him many pieces of advice. This kind of advice would not be given to ordinary people who know that Mr. Ge Laiheng's son is the company's young master. His father's ability to put aside the private feelings between father and son and frankly speak his mind from the company's perspective is very valuable to him.

Letter 10: The Way of Doing Business

Dear Son:

When I watched you depart yesterday to begin your travels, I felt somewhat uneasy because you seemed very proud, as if you were now the most important person in the entire company. But you need to know that what we need are orders, not the flamboyant demeanor of an external employee.

Sausage is one of the main products of our company, so everything should be planned very carefully. Last week, the director of the sausage department suggested adding a lead tag to the sausage. I immediately stopped him, because that would invisibly become a trademark, which would add a lot of trouble when selling in the future. This proves our prudence in handling affairs.

I hope you will firmly remember in your mind that this trip is somewhat of a test. Whether you can succeed completely depends on your own efforts. A true salesperson is one-tenth speaking and nine-tenths judgment. He should use nine-tenths of his judgment to determine when to use that one-tenth of speaking. Many salespeople think that purchasing agents are interested in baseball and funny stories, and that doing business is only secondary. However, people who can reach the position of purchasing agent cannot succeed by listening to jokes.

Of course, it is best if you can be amiable in dealing with people, but excessive amiability becomes useless. A truly shrewd purchasing agent is not interested in anything other than the quality and price of our goods. You don't have to give in to your competitors, but you don't have to talk about their shortcomings. You don't have to kneel down to beg for orders, but you can't hold your nose too high either. During your travels, you will inevitably meet many people you don't like, but those people are precisely the ones who can have a business relationship with the company.

If you want to be a top-notch salesman, you should aim for the following three points: (1) Send orders to the company, (2) Continue to send more orders, (3) Send orders of greater value. If you can do these three points, then you will definitely not have time to write long letters, and we will definitely not have time to read long letters, because we will be busy manufacturing and shipping goods. We are not interested in the orders that others have obtained, so if someone else steals your order, you don't have to report to the company, because the most appropriate way, of course, is not to have your business stolen by others. The best way is to send your address and orders to the company every day, so that we can know all your dynamics.

I once represented a company and went to Cairo, Egypt to sell clothing supplies. When I arrived there, I initially came into contact with the new environment and thought that there was a very good possibility of sales, and that business would definitely succeed in the future. However, the results of the sales were not as ideal as I had imagined, so I often wrote letters to the head office reporting the reasons for the failure and the details of how the competitors were stealing business. As a result, the head office sent a telegram with the text: "We know all the movements of the competitors, they have obtained all the business, but what are you doing?" At that time, I immediately understood that it was useless to explain any further, and the only thing to do was to resign, so I sent out the resignation letter. Now we have the same attitude towards you, waiting for your orders or your resignation letter.

Your loving father, Ge Laiheng.

### A Letter to the Children

‚Äî Lu Qi

Dear Children:

Time flies so fast, and the cold winter is coming again. Are the children also unhappy about the arrival of winter? Because it is too cold, your fingers will freeze and turn red, and your mother will not allow you to go out to play. But children, have you seen many poor children on the road? They are wearing thin clothes, walking and working on the road, hungry and cold. They are just as good children as you are, and their mothers love them too, but they are too poor. In order to live, they have to work in the wind and snow.

The day before yesterday, I walked past Yu Qiaqing Road and saw many people surrounding a bundle. There was a dead child lying there, his small face convulsed with terror. Alas, children, I was extremely sad. You see, this child died without doing anything wrong.

In this cold winter, children, I don't know how many poor children will freeze to death or starve to death. People should help each other. Now the YWCA has launched a winter clothing drive to help these many suffering children. Children, would you be willing to save a little bit of your candy money to help these many suffering children? We hope that you and your parents will save together to sew cotton clothes for these many suffering children.

Your friend, Lu Qi

### YWCA Launches Winter Clothing Drive

The weather is getting colder and colder, and there seems to be a bleak atmosphere on the streets. Of course, on the roads in the cold winter, you can see fur coats, woolen coats, and velvet coats! Warmly dressed pedestrians, but have you ever seen those hardworking and impoverished people, who for their own lives, wear only their thin winter clothes, braving the fierce wind, stepping on the ice and snow, and working? Do their teeth chatter, and their bodies and legs tremble? When you walk past them, have you ever had the compassionate thought of reaching out a hand to save them? Seeing the need for this relief work, the Shanghai YWCA has distributed winter clothing in previous years. This year, everyone knows that life is more difficult, so the need for this relief work has also increased accordingly. Although this work is quite complicated and difficult, the YWCA, based on its consistent spirit of service in the past, will continue to promote this work this year. Naturally, the completion of this work still depends on the sponsorship and promotion of enthusiastic people in society.

"Relief Targets" The relief targets this year are still the general elderly, weak, and women and children.

"Purpose of Donations" The purpose of the donation is "30,000 yuan." It is estimated that new clothes can be sewn at 60 yuan per set, which can make 500 sets, that is, 1,000 pieces. It is hoped that 5,000 sets of old clothes can be collected (that is, 10,000 pieces). If the donation exceeds that, then of course there will be more clothes.

"Methods of Donation" The YWCA is just a social service organization. The donation of funds depends entirely on enthusiastic people in society, who cooperate and pledge donations. The methods of donation can be divided into the following aspects: (1) Donating cash‚Äîpledging set donations (60 yuan per set) or donating arbitrarily (amount not fixed). (2) Donating winter clothes and asking our association to distribute them on your behalf. (3) Donating new and old fabrics, cotton, thread, foreign currency, etc. (4) Donating labor‚Äîvolunteering to sew clothes. (5) Donating old clothes, old shoes, old pants, old socks, etc. All the above items are very welcome if donated.

"Sewing and Distribution of Clothes" is in line with the nature of relief. We will use generally unemployed women to sew clothes. Under the principle of paying by the piece, their lives can be slightly subsidized. In addition, we will invite our members and enthusiastic people in society to jointly undertake this sewing work. As for the distribution of winter clothing, it is also very strict.

### Talking about Making Steamed Buns (Mantou) from Experience

‚Äî Xingye

Every time we receive flour, we always make pancakes and noodles to eat. It is inevitable to get tired of it. I wanted to make steamed buns, but I didn't know how to ferment them. Once, I received flour at the rice store and bought a piece of Xinya yeast. I took a sheet of instructions and went back to try it, and it turned out very well. Now I will write down my experience below for reference.

First, dissolve a piece of yeast in lukewarm water and mix well, add a little sugar. Then weigh two catties of flour, put it in a ceramic basin, slowly pour in the dissolved water, kneading as you pour, and knead it into a soft dough. Cover it with a damp towel and place it in a warm place (such as near the stove), and then wait for it to ferment.

After three hours, go and take a look. The dough has swelled to more than twice its original size. I was very surprised and thought that this yeast was indeed good. Immediately, I made individual steamed buns and arranged them on the table (sprinkle some dry flour on the table first). Because if it is not covered well, the steamed buns will be blown by the wind and form a hard skin, so they will not be soft.

At this time, prepare the pot, steamer (or steaming rack). Put a damp cloth in the steamer, first use a strong fire to boil the water. Then put the prepared steamed buns into the steamer, steam for about ten minutes, the hot steam rises straight up, and the steamed buns are ready. I ate the soft steamed buns that I made myself, and my heart was happy, which is truly indescribable in words.

If the reader is interested, you may as well make them to change the taste, since Xinya yeast is sold in rice stores and food stores. (Advertisement)
