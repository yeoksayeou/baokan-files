Hundreds of Indians have been executed by the British authorities, but the anti-British movement has not diminished.

Geneva, May 9 (Dōmei News Agency) - According to a report from Crete, the British and Indian authorities have issued martial law orders in several states of India. It is reported that the reason is due to the recent executions by the British and Indian authorities, with approximately one hundred Indians being executed daily.

The Indian government knows that the Indian people are prepared to overthrow British rule and therefore plans to establish a military dictatorship in India to increase oppressive measures.

If we want to obtain India's independence, the only way is through full-scale open rebellion.

Sevastopol Faces Unprecedented Offensive and Defensive Battle; Germany Gains Air Supremacy; Soviet Union Uses Fleet as Main Defense

Headquarters of the German Leader, May 10 (Kaitō News Agency) - The German High Command announced in its war report today that the German army, with the effective assistance of the air force in Sevastopol, has continued to capture numerous defensive works after fierce fighting. In the battles southeast of Lake Ilmen, from June 3rd to 5th, 483 enemy positions were destroyed by our forces. The enemy concentrated attacks on our bridgehead on the Volkhov front but was defeated by the brave soldiers who firmly defended the bridgehead. From June 8th to 9th, 24 enemy tanks were destroyed by our forces.

Lisbon, May 9 (Dōmei News Agency) - The German offensive on Sevastopol intensified on the 9th. German and Soviet forces have deployed their land, sea, and air forces, respectively, engaging in a major offensive and defensive battle. According to news received here from Moscow on the 9th, a war correspondent from the Red Army newspaper Red Star reported on the situation in Sevastopol, stating that today is the fifth day of operations in Sevastopol. The German army launched its third general offensive with large forces including tanks and aircraft. Our forces are defending from three-dimensional defensive positions and are engaged in fierce fighting with the German army. Subsequently, the German army deployed reserve forces and launched a fierce attack on our positions. Both sides are currently engaged in bloody combat. According to a Reuters report from Stockholm, although the Sevastopol naval port has a large supply of weapons and ammunition, as well as underground arsenals, the Soviet forces are at a disadvantage due to a lack of aircraft and are only engaged in arduous fighting. The crisis of the port's fall is imminent.

Berlin, May 10 (Kaitō News Agency) - Authoritative sources here declared today that the German army continued to make progress in Sevastopol yesterday. Soviet counterattacks suffered heavy losses and retreated. The battle of Sevastopol may continue for some time because the city's defensive works are extremely strong. Many of the enemy's positions are built on cliffs, so their resistance can only be destroyed by aircraft and artillery fire.

Stockholm, May 10 (Havas Agency) - In the eastern front, the battle in the Sevastopol area is intensifying. German artillery, aircraft, tanks, and infantry are jointly attacking the Red Army. The intensity of the Red Army's resistance is unprecedented. The situation is truly as the German side stated yesterday: it is not a major battle every mile but a major battle every yard. German aircraft dropped thousands of bombs and incendiary bombs on the city of Sevastopol. The army is attacking the outer defenses of the city. The Red Army admitted that the defense line was breached in one place, but it was quickly restored to its original state. The slopes around the city are covered with Red Army corpses. The accumulation of tanks and field guns is countless. According to German sources, the troops of General von Manstein are only six to twelve miles from the city. All residents of the city have mobilized to participate in air defense work. In five days, a total of 70 German aircraft have been shot down. It is rumored that a portion of the Soviet fleet in the port of Sevastopol is commanded by British officers and soldiers, but this has not been confirmed. Over the past week, several ships fully loaded with soldiers and military equipment have sailed to the port. The Soviet Union is using its fleet as its main defense, so even though the German army has gained air supremacy, it is still difficult to capture the port, which remains steadfast.

Berlin, May 10 (Kaitō News Agency) - Military circles in Berlin stated yesterday that the battles around Sevastopol are extremely fierce. Soviet forces are actively increasing their defensive fortifications, and their technology for constructing fortifications and shelters and burying landmines has improved. This need not be kept secret, so the German advance must proceed step by step. Since Sevastopol was besieged, it has lost its value as a naval base. However, sources believe that the Soviet army has not completely stopped using sea routes to transport reinforcements and supplies to Sevastopol.

German High Command Prepares to Launch New Offensive in Southern Sector

Stockholm, May 9 (Havas Agency) - Military sources here stated that over the past four days, the port of Sevastopol has suffered heavy bombardment. The German forces are concentrating on the southwestern part of the Crimean Peninsula, preparing to attack this fortress. The main force is the 11th Army, with 130,000 officers and soldiers and hundreds of aircraft, under the command of General von Manstein. A spokesperson for the Soviet government stated that the port of Sevastopol has underground factories, and there is no shortage of military equipment and ammunition for the defenders. The only shortcoming is that the fortress lacks an air base. This statement can almost be seen as an implication by the Soviet government to public opinion that the fortress will soon fall. However, the Soviet government's war report released today still stated that the German army's repeated attacks on Sevastopol were repelled by the Red Army and suffered heavy losses. In addition, the Red Army newspaper Red Star had a dispatch from the front stating that the pressure exerted by the German army on the port of Sevastopol is increasing. Axis forces briefly invaded Red Army positions yesterday but were repelled by the evening. The Red Army counterattacked victoriously. Considering the facts, it is undeniable that the Red Army there is in a weaker position than the German army. Military circles in Germany say that the fall of the port of Sevastopol is only a matter of time because the German land and air forces have superiority, and the Soviet side cannot transfer large numbers of reinforcements to strengthen the defenses. Foreign observers here believe that the German attack on the port is a feint, a strategic preparation for launching an offensive elsewhere. The eastern front is relatively quiet at the moment, but a major battle is expected to occur soon. After the battles of Kharkov and Kursk concluded, the German High Command is fully prepared to use the newly occupied positions as a starting point for launching a new offensive. At present, people's attention is not only focused on Kalinin but also on the Kharkov, Rostov, and Leningrad regions. The Red Army has launched a counterattack near the city of Volkhov. The Red Army's positions from Lake Ladoga to the city of Vologda are as solid as a fortress. This route is also one of the German army's offensive targets. Volkhov is located on the railway line from Arkhangelsk to Moscow, which is the starting point for the transport of British and American military equipment to Moscow. The German army intends to cut off traffic on the two railways between Murmansk and Arkhangelsk this summer. If the German army occupies the city of Vologda, it can cut off the transport on these two railways. However, the German army must attack the city after the fall of Leningrad because the German army is still surrounding Leningrad and cannot withdraw troops to attack the city. According to neutral observers, Germany will launch an offensive in the southern sector. Rostov and the Caucasus region remain the German army's targets.

Odessa Port: Underground Caves Extend for Miles; Romanian Army Intensifies Blockade; Soviet Guerrillas Captured

Bucharest, May 9 (Havas Agency) - The southern Soviet port of Odessa is built on a mountain and is extremely strong. The underground caves extend for miles and are full of defensive works. The Red Army previously put up a tenacious resistance in the port, creating an epic history of war. Later, when the Red Army retreated, some of the troops remained entrenched in the caves, engaging in guerrilla warfare. Although the German and Romanian forces occupied the port and the city, they are still struggling to deal with the elusive Red Army guerrillas who appear and disappear in the caves. For several months, the Romanian military authorities have been working to block off the caves. As a result, the remaining strength of the Red Army is dwindling. Recently, another secret cave was discovered. This cave had been carefully hidden by the Red Army staff, so it was not discovered for a long time. It contained more than 50 guerrillas, who were often captured together. A small-scale power plant with an electric engine, a radio, and all kinds of military equipment were also seized in the cave.

Weather Improves in North Africa; Fierce Fighting Continues; British Correspondent Describes Situation as "Libyan Hell"

Somewhere on the Libyan Border, May 9 (Havas Agency) - In the past 24 hours, fierce fighting has continued in the areas of Hagino and Knightsbridge. The positions of the two armies are inextricably linked. To summarize, it is roughly as follows:

The German and Italian allied forces once again attacked the British army's positions at Knightsbridge. At the same time, the German army also launched a separate attack on the precipitous positions west of Knightsbridge.

The main force of the British army is busy dealing with the enemy's motorized units and attempting to mend the gaps breached by the German army on the defensive line. Generally speaking, General Rommel of Germany is advancing with his troops toward Acroma and Tobruk, while the British army intends to encircle the Axis forces from the east and west in order to cut off their communications.

Madrid, May 10 (Kaitō News Agency) - Asia, the London correspondent for "Ya," stated that when British war correspondents describe the Libyan war, they call it "Libyan Hell." According to British war correspondents, only the most hardy and brave soldiers in the world can withstand the heat and difficult conditions of the North African front. Regarding the war itself, London believes that the war is not very favorable to Britain and has admitted that British losses have been significant.

Stockholm, May 10 (Kaitō News Agency) - British newspapers today reported that the weather in Libya has improved, so the fighting is even more intense. British newspapers do not want to comment on this, only saying that the epoch-making battle currently taking place in Libya may determine who will have hegemony over the Mediterranean.

Battle Zone Shifts to Bir Hakeim

Stockton, May 10 (Dōmei News Agency) - The combat zone in the Libyan desert has suddenly shifted 25 miles south of Knightsbridge to Bir Hakeim. The Axis forces mobilized more tanks, dive bombers, infantry, and artillery yesterday, launching a very fierce attack. Reports from Cairo today state that German and Italian forces engaged in combat with heavy tanks and aircraft at Bir Hakeim, one end of the Gazala Line. German and Italian armored units and infantry stormed the positions held by the Tegol forces. According to a Cairo communiqué today, British armored and mechanized forces assisted the Tegol forces in defending Bir Hakeim yesterday, resisting the increasingly intense Axis attacks.

Rome, May 10 (Kaitō News Agency) - This afternoon, the Italian military report stated that fierce fighting occurred in many locations on the Marmarica front yesterday. The enemy launched a counterattack under the cover of tanks but was heavily damaged and repelled by our forces. The air force's bombing was very effective. German and Italian destroyers were very active, shooting down 17 enemy aircraft in air combat. Two of our aircraft did not return to their original defense. British aircraft engaged in combat with Axis aircraft over Malta, and five British aircraft were shot down by our side. British aircraft continued to raid Taranto, destroying three houses. To date, 20 people have been killed and 74 injured in the area by bombings.

Berlin, May 10 (Kaitō News Agency) - Military circles in Berlin state that whether General Rommel's ultimate military objective in the current North African war is Tobruk remains a matter of open discussion. It is believed here that control of the Mediterranean is the greatest military objective of the desert war. However, military circles here refuse to comment on each stage of the war. It is believed here that if Rommel's intention is to occupy Tobruk, then what he wants is undoubtedly a good supply base. Military circles in Berlin confirmed that the current war in North Africa is the largest war ever fought in the desert. The number of troops and military equipment involved is unprecedented. Military circles here refused to comment on the British reports that German Generals Bismarck and Nering had arrived in North Africa, only saying that they had contributed greatly to the construction and training of German armored forces.

In general, it seems that the Soviet Union intends to smuggle its agents into Turkish territory.

Ankara, May 10 (Kaitō News Agency) - Authorities here have not yet confirmed the rumors that Soviet paratroopers have landed in Turkish territory. The atmosphere in the Turkish-Soviet border area is extremely tense, and passage is impossible.

In his address, Hayes strongly emphasized Roosevelt's desire to promote friendly relations between the U.S. and Spain, saying, "As a former professor of history, I am well aware of how much the United States and other countries have benefited from Spain. Approximately 450 years ago, a Spanish admiral discovered the New World and then introduced European religious and cultural institutions, as well as the noble ideals of human character, to the New World, creating the Americas of today. The United States believes that international trade should be free from any restrictions, so that all countries can obtain resources from all regions. These raw materials should also be equally distributed among all countries. In view of the difficult situation under the current circumstances, the United States is very willing to trade with friendly countries and exchange goods."

A Special Collection on Countries of the Near East, Three, A Brief History of Syria (Three)

(VII) After the Outbreak of the Great War

After the outbreak of the Great War, both Britain and France recognized the importance of the Near East and sent troops there. Syria had the most troops stationed within it. Syria’s capital, Damascus, was an important location in communication between British Transjordan and Palestine. At the same time, Damascus was also west of Iraq, which could be described as the gateway to the oilfields in the Near East. In order to protect the petroleum resources of the Near East, Syria had to be secured. At that time, no one made the number of French troops stationed there public, but according to general reports, the number of troops ranged from 100,000 to 150,000. General Weygand was the commander-in-chief of the French forces in this location before the French entered the Great War, and also served as the Allied commander-in-chief.

The British army, in light of the failure in Crete, and the pressure that came with the looming crisis in the Near East, on the morning of June 8, 1941, in conjunction with the Tegol army, separated into four divisions and entered Syria. In less than two weeks, the war came to an end. Syria changed from a French mandated territory to a "temporary occupied area" by the British and Tegol armies.

(VIII) Declaration of Independence

After the British and Tegol armies occupied Syria, Syria's political system did not change much. As for personnel changes, former Prime Minister Taj al-Din al-Hasani was elected as the Grand President, and issued a declaration of independence on September 27 of last year. It was written:

Syria exercises its sovereignty as an independent Syrian. The Allied forces of Britain and Tegol ensure the local security, only for the duration of the war. Syria is a new member of the Allied nations, so Syria's policies should be consistent with the Allied powers' policies. Under the continuation of the war, the Syrian government, in light of the necessity of the objective situation, especially appointed the Allied Commander-in-Chief as the commander-in-chief. All of our people should work together with him.

This declaration was issued in the name of the Syrian government. The issuance of this declaration by the Syrian government was the result of negotiations with the British and Tegol armies. However, whether Syria can truly gain independence after the war will depend on the situation at that time.

(IX) Current Situation

Currently, the strength of the British and Tegol armies in Syria is said to be about five divisions, and their distribution is as follows: In Aleppo, there is a British division and a brigade stationed; in Beirut and Damascus, there are about two British brigades and a Tegol division stationed. In addition, in Palestine, Kerak, Iraq and other places, the British have also sent heavy troops to garrison. At the same time, the military railway that crosses Syria from Palestine to the Turkish border is also being built to facilitate transportation. All these facilities are naturally intended to strengthen the defense of Syria and the entire Near East.

However, although the British army is strengthening the defense of Syria on the one hand, the crisis in Syria has not been resolved. The military threat of the German army aside, even with Syria itself, all kinds of crises that should be pointed out are exposed...

The Arab movement within Syria has always been fierce. The British and French authorities' broken promises for their own benefit after the last Great War are still resented by the Arabs. The issuance of the Taj al-Din al-Hasani Declaration of Independence, although owing to the success of former French Governor of Vietnam, Catroux, in uniting the Syrian nationalists, is still viewed with suspicion and disbelief by the majority of Arabs. If the war expands to Syrian territory in the future, the allegiance of these indigenous peoples should be noted.

In the Near East, the Jewish and Muslim races originally regarded each other as fire and water. Since last June, the Jews of Palestine have taken advantage of the British influence to extend into Syria and have moved into Syria from Palestine one after another. As a result, the commerce of Syria and Lebanon has gradually been manipulated by the Jews. The military railway that crosses Syria is contracted by a company run by Jews, and the resentment of the Muslims is growing deeper. If this is not harmonized, the situation in the future is quite worrying.

Syria is an agricultural country, and there was no food problem originally. After the British army entered Syria last year, the British army purchased all the grain stored in the country, so the price of food has been high since this spring. As the saying goes, the people regard food as heaven. If this is not resolved, local peace may also be at risk.

Number of Rice Shops in the Two Concessions Increased to Over 600; Actively Preparing for Metered Rice Distribution Method

The number of rice shops in the two concessions has increased from 372 to 668, an increase of 296. Although rice has not yet been allocated for sale, the guarantee money they have paid to the Public Works Department has already been submitted, so they have actually resumed business. The increase in the number of rice shops is to prepare for the implementation of the metered rice distribution method. The Rice and Grain Management Committee of the Public Works Department has been carrying out all preparations for metered rice distribution in recent days, and is currently proceeding with this in a dedicated manner. The method starts with the compilation of charts of the household registration and door numbers in each area of the Public Concession, paying special attention to the rice shops near the area. According to the rice distribution method, the head of the household will purchase one week's worth of rice for himself, his family

### Japanese Imperial Headquarters Announces Japanese Naval, Land, and Air Forces Attack Alaska; Fierce Assault on Dutch Harbor in the Aleutian Islands While Naval and Air Forces Attack Midway Island

Tokyo, 10th (Domei News Agency) – The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 2:30 PM this afternoon: Imperial Navy units operating in the Eastern Pacific Ocean on June 4th launched a swift attack on the enemy stronghold of Dutch Harbor in the Aleutian Islands and the surrounding area, repeatedly attacking on the 4th and 5th. Simultaneously, on the 5th, they attacked the enemy base of Midway Island in the central Pacific, fiercely assaulting the American fleet reinforcing that area, heavily damaging enemy naval and air power, as well as important military installations. Furthermore, from the 7th onward, in close cooperation with ground forces, they attacked key points in the Aleutian Islands. The war is currently in progress. Preliminary investigations reveal the following results to date: "Midway Island Area" – Sunk two American aircraft carriers, the "Endeavor-class" and the "Hornet-class"; shot down approximately 120 enemy aircraft in aerial combat; destroyed numerous important enemy military installations. "Dutch Harbor Area" – Shot down 14 enemy aircraft; sunk one large enemy transport ship; destroyed two heavy oil depots and one large hangar. "Our Losses" – One aircraft carrier sunk, another heavily damaged; one cruiser heavily damaged; 35 aircraft did not return.

Tokyo, 10th (Domei News Agency) – The two American aircraft carriers sunk by the Japanese Navy, the "Endeavor-class" and "Hornet-class," are of the same type as the medium-sized "Yorktown-class" aircraft carrier sunk during the Battle of the Coral Sea. The "Endeavor-class" was launched in October 1936 and completed in May 1938, with a displacement of 19,900 tons, a crew of 2,072, and armed with eight 127mm anti-aircraft guns and sixteen 40mm anti-aircraft guns. It also had sixteen anti-aircraft machine guns and carried 80 aircraft. This ship was damaged by Japanese forces during the Hawaiian naval battle and is thought to have been repaired before returning to battle. The "Hornet-class" was launched in December 1940 and completed in November 1941, carrying 80 aircraft. The "Hornet-class" is smaller than the "Saratoga-class," with a reduced target area, but possesses excellent speed. It carries roughly the same number of aircraft but has the advantage of being exceptionally maneuverable. Since the losses of the "Saratoga" and "Yorktown," the American Navy has relied on these two ships as its main weapons of war. Before the war, the United States possessed a total of seven aircraft carriers, and now only the "Ranger" and two others remain.

### Overview of Dutch Harbor

Tokyo, 10th (Domei News Agency) – Dutch Harbor is located on the eastern shore of Unalaska Island in the Aleutian Islands, with a normal population of about one thousand. During the fishing season, this number greatly increases. The climate is mild, not overly hot in the summer, but often experiences dense fog from autumn to winter. The harbor is a deep-water port and also serves as a connection point for the North Pacific air route, making its position quite important. Recently, the United States has established an air force base in the area, actively strengthening its military equipment and building wireless stations, gasoline tanks, large piers, and aircraft repair facilities. Naval fleets are also frequently stationed here for exercises. Additionally, there is a submarine base, serving as the center for the defense of the Bering Sea and the Aleutian Islands, and also as a foothold for the United States' attempt to attack Japan.

Tokyo, 10th (Domei News Agency) – Colonel Hirade, chief of the naval press section of the Japanese Imperial Headquarters, delivered a radio address today entitled "New Operations Unfold in the Eastern Pacific." The main points of his speech are as follows: Only half a year has passed since December 9th of last year, and the Japanese Navy has already completely driven out the British, American, and Dutch navies from the Western Pacific. Now, it is turning its attention to the Eastern Pacific to launch new operations. On the 5th of this month, it conducted an air raid on Midway Island, the forward base of the United States, inflicting heavy damage, and repeatedly raided the Aleutian Islands, heavily damaging enemy air force bases. However, the United States is again resorting to old tricks, spreading an atmosphere of great victory. For example, the commander of the U.S. Pacific Fleet, Nimitz, falsely claimed to have sunk two Japanese aircraft carriers and three battleships, and heavily damaged two others. However, when we recall the naval battles of Hawaii, Makassar, and the Coral Sea, the United States engaged in large-scale rumor-mongering after major defeats, which undoubtedly proves this to be false propaganda. While the enemy at Midway Island is in a state of panic, foreign telegrams have reported that Sydney and Newcastle on the east coast of Australia were shelled by Japanese forces, and that Japanese ground and naval forces have launched a surprise attack and occupied key locations in the Aleutian Islands. This shows that the Japanese army has cut off the US's reliance on the northern route of attack against Japan. In this naval battle, the Japanese army surprised and destroyed Dutch Harbor, the most militarily important base in the Aleutian Islands, and the western parts of these islands were also occupied by the Japanese forces. The Japanese army contained the enemy by attacking the Midway Island area, so the enemy had no time to worry about the north. Following the naval battle around Midway, the Japanese army attacked its forward base and lured out enemy aircraft carriers to sink them. From the naval battle of Hawaii to the naval battle of the Coral Sea, the majority of the US aircraft carriers and battleships have been lost, and only three or four aircraft carriers remain. Therefore, if these are completely destroyed, the enemy's naval power cannot be rebuilt in a short period. In contrast, the Japanese Navy still retains a large number of aircraft carriers, and even a one-on-one attack method is acceptable. In short, no matter how the US government spreads false propaganda, the facts are obvious, and it will only increase the panic of the American people.

Countries participating in the establishment of a new Europe will not allow internal forces to undermine the work being done for national and ethnic interests. During my visit to Germany, I witnessed various great achievements and felt that our strength must be concentrated to move towards the same goal. Regarding the results of this trip, I will submit a report to the Foreign Affairs Committees of both houses on Friday.
