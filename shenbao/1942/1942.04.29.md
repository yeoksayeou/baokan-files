Tokyo, 28th (Domei News Agency dispatch) - Japanese naval forces, since March 31st, have launched a large-scale offensive operation against the Moluccas Islands and western New Guinea. The Japanese army overcame fierce enemy resistance, and by April 19th, all key locations had been occupied by the Japanese army. In this operation, 124 enemy soldiers were captured, and the Japanese army seized 715 heavy machine guns, 1,883,000 rounds of ammunition, 5 river motorboats, and large quantities of gasoline, jute, and cotton. From now on, the Japanese army's offensive operations in New Guinea will enter a fierce stage. The Japanese forces have gradually expanded from the northern half of New Guinea to the southern half. At the same time, the Japanese naval forces are active in the Solomon Islands area, and the attack on Port Moresby is becoming more intense, threatening northern Australia.

New Guinea is Rich in Resources

Tokyo, 28th (Domei News Agency dispatch) - Mr. Fujiya, of the Japanese Nanyo Kohatsu Company, visited the South Seas several times after the Japanese army occupied western New Guinea. According to his recent remarks, the company has established an office in Sarem, on the northwest coast of New Guinea. Sarem is a key port in western New Guinea, and Nanyo Kohatsu Company has purchased 56,000 acres of land there, initially planting 8,000 acres with jute, with excellent results, due to the well-distributed rainfall and suitable climate in the area. Sarem also has facilities such as government offices and small schools. There are only five Japanese people there, but many overseas Chinese, mostly engaged in commerce. There are also 350 Portuguese people. Five hundred miles east of Sarem, there is an oil field with abundant oil reserves. Oil gushes out from the upper reaches of the Tair River and near the Billy River. The Japanese have spent decades developing the oil field in that area. With the Japanese army occupying the area, future development work should proceed more smoothly.

Tokyo, 28th (Domei News Agency dispatch) - The main points occupied by the Japanese navy during the offensive operation in western New Guinea and their general conditions are listed below: "Puna" is located on Seram Island and has large piers for oil fields, airfields, hospitals, power plants, and other facilities, which can be described as complete. Large-scale oil extraction projects have already been carried out there. "Pupu" is a strategic point at the western end of New Guinea. "Babaw" is located at the western end of New Guinea. Two years ago, 1,000 oil extraction workers were engaged in oil extraction there. "Isuren Island" is one of the islands in western New Guinea, with a population of about 400 people. There are many facilities such as civilian airfields and oil fields. "Kannadi" is located at the western end of Gilolo Island and is an important location in the central part. "Maroguaya" is located in northern New Guinea and has urban facilities such as government offices, telegraph offices, and power plants. "Muwei" is located in northern New Guinea. The Japanese army occupied the rubber plantation operated by the Dutch government. Nearby is the farm of the Japan Southern Development Company. "Serui Island" is an island in northern New Guinea, with facilities such as an airfield and telegraph office. It produces wood resin and dried coconut, etc. "Nabire" is a strategic point in northern New Guinea. "Sarem" is located in northern New Guinea, where the Japanese Nanyo Kohatsu Company has established a farm. "Hollandia" is located in northern New Guinea and is a key point between eastern and western New Guinea, with a telegraph office. In addition, western New Guinea has traditionally been developed by the Japan Southern Development Company. The company now has offices in Maroguaya, as well as business locations in Muwei, Nabire, and Sarem. The company's main products are jute, cotton, timber, rice, and resin, etc.

### US President Submits New Wartime Economic Measures to Congress; Main Contents Include Seven Items to Prevent Vicious Inflation

Washington, 27th (Reuters dispatch) - President Roosevelt sent a letter to Congress today proposing a plan to prevent vicious inflation, which stipulates that private and public expenditures will be strictly limited, and the general standard of living will be reduced to the greatest extent. The scope of the plan includes taxation, profits, prices, rents, wages, savings, fixed allocation, and installment purchases, divided into seven points: 1. Levying heavy taxes to limit the profits of individuals and corporations to a reasonable level, with "reasonable" meaning "minimum level." 2. Setting maximum prices for wholesale and consumer goods, and maximum rent restrictions in areas related to various wartime industries. 3. Stabilizing wages. 4. Stabilizing agricultural product prices. 5. Encouraging people to buy wartime government bonds. 6. Implementing a rationing system for essential goods, which are already showing signs of shortage. 7. Contracting credit, restricting installment purchases, and encouraging people to pay off debts, mortgages, and other debts to avoid rising living expenses.

### Roosevelt Makes a General Comparison of the Situations of the Two World Wars

In his message, the President made a comparison between the situation in this war and the previous wartime situation, stating briefly: The enemy has already gained various initial advantages, so all those responsible for protecting civilization must endure painful setbacks and significant losses before the Allied countries establish their advantage in manpower and armaments to reverse the situation. The United States on December 7, 1941, was better prepared for war than the United States on April 6, 1917. However, since the Pearl Harbor incident, the American people have begun to implement a nationwide plan for wartime production, which was considered absurd by the general public two years ago. The implementation of this plan requires most of American industry to switch from the production of peacetime goods to the production of weapons of war. Therefore, the disruption of the way of life of industry, labor, agriculture, and finance, as well as every citizen and every family, is unavoidable. We are once again in the same situation as in the last World War, only on a larger scale today. The rise in the cost of living during this war has begun to parallel the situation in the last World War. Today is the time to stop this spiral rise. We must recognize the fact that the standard of living must be severely reduced. Based on the average price of necessities, our cost of living has increased by 15% since the autumn of 1939, so we must find a way to stop it now, to avoid a further increase of 80% or 90% in the next year or two, so that it can be maintained at the current level. I still remember the years after the last World War, when the American people lost their homes and farms and searched for work everywhere. After this war, we are determined not to let the brave soldiers fighting heroically on the battlefields today see this tragedy again.

Nationwide Broadcast Address Elucidates the Policies Adopted

Washington, 27th (Havas News Agency dispatch) - President Roosevelt delivered a nationwide broadcast address today, explaining the plans adopted by the government to enable the US economy to adapt to the current environment, and emphasizing the need to increase taxes, limit private and commercial profits, stabilize agricultural products.

Nationwide Broadcast Address Elucidates the Policies Adopted

Prices, canceling installment payment methods, and reducing the consumption of various important commodities are all necessary. He said, "In order to prevent prices from continuing to rise, we must agree to increase taxes, so we must also determine a reasonable level for salaries and commercial profits, but what I mean by reasonable is a fairly low level. We must also 'freeze' the prices of various major commodities and the rents in areas engaged in the production of military equipment. For this reason, we must not only stabilize the salaries of senior officials, but also stabilize the income of farmers. In addition, we should encourage people to actively contribute and purchase national defense bonds, so that people can donate their funds to the country instead of using them to purchase goods that are not absolutely necessary. However, for certain important commodities that are currently in short supply, we must agree to implement consumption restrictions. This measure can enable us to evenly distribute various persimmon goods to consumers, instead of allowing various goods to be possessed entirely by the wealthy who can afford high prices. The best way to suppress rising prices is to cancel installment payment methods for shopping and encourage people to redeem all mortgages. This policy can indirectly reduce the sales of various non-essential commodities, and encourage the public to actively purchase national defense bonds. In short, we should immediately take measures to ensure that the price level does not continue to rise. Since the autumn of 1939, prices have generally risen by 15%. It is expected that if no severe measures are taken next year, prices will increase by 80% or 90% again. After paying taxes, American people must not have an annual income of more than $25,000. As for the bonds issued by the state or various states, they must also be taxed. During this national war against foreign countries, if some people can still obtain harmony from the bonds issued by public institutions, it is the most immoral thing. As for canceling the 40-hour work week method, I do not agree, because this measure is only enough to create the result of not paying wages for extra working hours. If the method I have proposed to you does not prove effective, and the people's standard of living continues to rise, then I will send another message to the Senate and House of Representatives, asking them to grant me the power to take necessary and effective measures."

### Cripps Debates India Mission in Parliament; Explains Reasons for Failure of British-Indian Negotiations; Believes Door to Improving Relations Remains Open

London, 28th (Reuters dispatch) - When the House of Commons began formally debating Sir Stafford Cripps' mission to India this afternoon, Cripps said in his speech that when he was in India, the Japanese army would soon be approaching the Indian coast, and some Indian public opinion expressed an atmosphere of inevitable defeat, and the Indian Muslims disagreed on the future government of India, making the negotiations extremely difficult. The situation needed clarification and the opinions of the Indians needed to be consolidated, forcing the British government to decide to take concrete steps quickly. When he was in New Delhi, Colonel Johnson of the United States happened to arrive in India with an economic mission, which was a coincidence, so there was no question of American interference, but only a personal assistance from an American citizen. There was no disagreement on the basic points of Indian autonomy and future constitutional self-determination. The only disagreement was on the method of implementing self-determination. He was fully authorized by the War Cabinet to find a solution within the scope of the original proposal. The detailed explanation he gave to the Indian leaders was his own responsibility. The difficulties in the negotiations were about the method of determining the new constitution and the defense and all methods of the interim government. The responsibility of the British government is to try to reach a compromise and not to give any party everything they want. Although the original proposal of the British cabinet has been withdrawn, the door to closer cooperation between India and solving the post-war autonomy issue has not been closed. At present, the British side cannot continue to take action and must deal with it patiently. Cripps' speech lasted 59 minutes before it was finished.

### Britain Adopts New Strategy: Concentrating Air Force Strength Against Germany; Destroying Military Equipment as Main Objective; Germany Vows to Inflict Terrible Retaliation on Britain

Bern, Switzerland, 27th (Havas News Agency dispatch) - The "Swiss Daily" reported from London that Britain has now adopted a new strategy, which is to concentrate air force strength to bomb German industrial areas and submarine bases. Although British aircraft bombing did not begin today, the British strategy has completely changed, that is, concentrating strength to bomb important targets. The successive bombings of Saint-Nazaire, France, and Rostock, Germany, are clear proof of this. Britain and the United States are now striving to reduce the threat to their merchant ships, but according to the experience of recent months, relying solely on the protection of aircraft and warships is still insufficient. Therefore, it is necessary to destroy the enemy's submarine bases and factories for manufacturing submarines. From this point of view, attacking the European continent is not yet the time. London political circles believe that "patience is the greatest virtue" and should not be rushed before the overall victory is guaranteed.

Berlin, 28th (Havas News Agency dispatch) - The Political Foreign Affairs News recently published an editorial stating that the British Air Force's barbaric bombing of the ancient cities of Lübeck and Rostock in Germany has greatly angered the German people. This bombing is not attacking military or industrial equipment, but wantonly ravaging residential areas and destroying their cultural buildings, and its purpose is unknown. According to wartime conventions, cultural relics should be regarded as common to all countries, but Britain seems to deliberately destroy them. If the country continues to do so, Germany can only implement its terrible retaliation.

London, 28th (Reuters dispatch) - A British Air Ministry communiqué stated that a large British bomber formation attacked targets in Cologne and the Rhineland area of Germany last night, causing fires. Another large British aircraft formation bombed the German naval base in Trondheim Bay, Norway, with unknown results. British aircraft also bombed the docks of Dunkirk and the airfields in the German-occupied areas, and laid mines in German territorial waters. Seventeen attacking British aircraft went missing. A British coastal aircraft also damaged a German supply ship off the coast of Denmark. According to reconnaissance, Rostov was recently attacked by British aircraft, and the main factories and affiliated buildings of the Heinkel aircraft factory in the area have been mostly destroyed. As of yesterday afternoon, the area was still burning.

London, 27th (Havas News Agency dispatch) - The Air Ministry issued a communiqué this evening stating that British aircraft, including Boston bombers and Whirlwind aircraft, today bombed various military targets in Lille, France, the port of Ostend, Belgium, and other airfields under German occupation again. The results of the bombing are not yet known, but it is estimated that 10 German fighters were destroyed. Sixteen British fighters and two bombers also failed to return to their bases.

London, 28th (Havas News Agency dispatch) - The Air Ministry announced this morning that enemy aircraft concentrated their bombing on a city in the East Anglia district last night, causing many civilian casualties and heavy material losses.

Berlin, 29th (Haitong News Agency dispatch) - German fighter aircraft formations bombed the city of East Anglia, southeast England, last night, dropping heavy bombs and incendiary bombs, and returned after completing their mission.

Stockholm, Sweden, 28th (Haitong News Agency dispatch) - London officials stated that German aircraft attacked Norwich, a city in East Anglia, on Sunday night. The area is a textile, machinery, and food center with a population of 140,000.

Berlin, 28th (Haitong News Agency dispatch) - According to the German High Command, British aircraft attempted to attack northern France yesterday, and German aircraft intercepted them, shooting down six Spitfire aircraft. Another aircraft was shot down by anti-aircraft artillery. During the second attack by British aircraft, nine more were shot down by German aircraft, and one was shot down by anti-aircraft artillery. Yesterday, the British Air Force lost a total of seventeen aircraft off the northern coast of France. British aircraft dropped very few bombs and caused very little damage. Only one German aircraft requested to return.

### Military Experts Observe the War Situation; Attacking Norway is the Best Strategy for Britain

Washington, 27th (Havas News Agency dispatch) - Military experts here recently stated that instead of attempting to carry out a large-scale landing in France, Belgium, or the Netherlands, the British and American Allied forces should invade Norway. Britain's military strength is still insufficient to launch an offensive in the English Channel or the North Sea, and this attempt will inevitably fail. Moreover, the British army cannot expect to obtain the assistance of the American army, because if the American army wants to concentrate in Britain, it will take months due to transportation difficulties. On the contrary, it is also more difficult for Germany to defend Norway than to defend France, Belgium, or the Netherlands. The transportation line between Germany and Norway is very long. For example, the port of Narvik in northern Norway is 1,010 miles away from the port of Kiel in Germany, while it is only 950 miles from the British base of Scapa Flow to the port of Narvik, so transportation between the Allied countries and the port is convenient and easy to attack, while it is quite difficult for the German army to defend the port. No matter how solid the German defenses are, because the coastline of Norway is very long, there is no way to prevent the British and American Allied forces from gaining a "foothold" in any one place. Moreover, since the United States and the Soviet Union have been sailing to Murmansk, the United States has been supplying the Soviet Union with military equipment, and Norway's strategic position has become increasingly important. Germany has repeatedly attacked this transportation line, which is related to the victory or defeat of the Allied countries, from the Norwegian naval base for this reason. In short, if the Allied countries can control Norway, they will use a first-class base to attack Finland. This small country has been exhausted by fighting with the Soviet Union, and this move by Britain and the United States may be successful.

### Malta Bombed - Severe Damage - Napoleon's Headquarters Destroyed Destroyed

Havas News Agency, Malta, 27th - Recent bombings of Malta have caused severe damage. The famous ancient Malta fortress and Napoleon's former headquarters, "The Palace of the Knights," were destroyed.

There were also extremely heavy civilian casualties, including the deaths of many officials and their families.

Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 28th - German aircraft formations bombed military installations on Malta yesterday, hitting and destroying many locations. A munitions depot southeast of Venice was hit by multiple bombs. Several aircraft on the ground between Luqa and Qormi were destroyed by our bombs. Several anti-aircraft gun positions on the north shore of the island were also destroyed by our bombs.

### Smolensk Front - German Offensive Fails - Soviet Forces on the Kalinin Front Destroy German Fortifications

Reuters, Moscow, 28th - Today's Soviet supplementary communique stated that German forces in several sectors of the Smolensk front in the central region, assisted by aircraft and tank columns, launched repeated offensives over the past few days, but were ultimately repelled. The Germans suffered considerable losses. A Soviet unit on the Kalinin front destroyed 25 German fortifications and killed over 200 enemy soldiers. Five Soviet partisan units in the Orel region killed 433 enemy soldiers and wounded approximately 200 German soldiers during March. They also destroyed four bridges and derailed a German troop train on April 13th. The Soviet midday communique simply stated: "Nothing of significance occurred on the front during the night of April 27th."

Havas News Agency, Berlin, 28th - The Supreme Headquarters has announced that German forces have launched successful localized counter-offensives in the central and northern sectors of the Eastern Front, inflicting heavy losses on the enemy. Our forces destroyed 13 enemy tanks in one sector. Simultaneously, our air force bombed enemy merchant ships in the Port of Leningrad and along the Sea of Azov. In the Arctic region, five Soviet aircraft bombed a German port and were shot down by our forces.

Molotov Describes German Atrocities

### Canadian Prime Minister May Announce Severance of Relations with Vichy - Conscription Referendum Result Soon to be Announced

Reuters, Ottawa, 28th - Canadian Prime Minister King is expected to address the House of Commons this afternoon regarding Canada's position.

Haitong News Agency, Vichy, 28th - The French Foreign Ministry issued an official statement last night regarding Franco-Canadian relations, stating that Canadian Prime Minister King will address Parliament today to announce Canada's severance of diplomatic relations with France. In reality, Canada has had no representative stationed in France since France signed the armistice agreement, so diplomatic relations have long been suspended, a situation similar to the relationship between France and the Union of South Africa. Therefore, this move only confirms a fact that already exists.

Reuters, Toronto, 28th - Canadian Prime Minister King had previously pledged not to implement conscription. He recently held a national referendum to seek the public's opinion on whether to rescind that pledge. Of the 31203 polling districts across Canada, results from 2348 districts have been tallied so far, showing that a majority of Canadians support rescinding the government's commitment. Prime Minister King issued a statement saying that the people's attitude is evident in the results of this vote. This vote should not be interpreted as a vote of confidence in the current government or a vote for any particular party, but rather as an expression of the national will, the importance of which cannot be overstated.

Havas News Agency, Ottawa, 28th - A national referendum on conscription was held yesterday. Although the final results have not yet been announced, current figures indicate that it will pass by a majority of approximately 1,030,957 votes to 716,669 votes. According to the voting results from Quebec Province, there were 339,329 votes against and only 109,536 votes in favor. However, the majority have not yet been announced. Demonstrations against conscription have occurred in certain locations, with protesters chanting "Down with conscription!"

Haitong News Agency, Stockholm, 28th - Canada held a referendum to decide whether to mandate the deployment of Canadian troops overseas for combat.

French Canadians largely expressed opposition. In Quebec Province, 909,835 people voted against, while only 367,361 voted in favor.

### Egypt's New Budget - Unprecedentedly Large

The Minister of Finance also announced that the British government has agreed to purchase 500,000 kantars of cotton at a price of £1.50, which is £0.50 higher than the price stipulated by the British Purchasing Commission. However, future transactions will not necessarily follow this price. As for Egypt, the taxes levied on large profits, beer, liquor, and essential goods have been increased. The Minister of Finance concluded by praising Britain for its assistance in supplying Egypt with tea and other goods.

### Tensions Between the Soviet Union and Turkey May Ease

Havas News Agency, Ankara, Turkey, 27th - The Soviet Ambassador to Turkey, Vinogradov, recently returned to his home country of Kuibyshev on official business. After completing his work, he returned here and yesterday accepted an invitation from the Turkish Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Aktay, for a lengthy conversation. Some people here therefore believe that the current tense relations between the Soviet Union and Turkey may ease. Reportedly, Britain is actively urging the Soviet Union to adopt a more moderate attitude regarding the trial of the Bahri case by the Istanbul court (which involves two Soviet citizens). It is said that the British Ambassador to Turkey, Knatchbull-Hugessen, has been working hard to mediate the situation.

### Indian Affairs Special

10. The Northwest Frontier of India (1)

The vastness of India, with its highly diverse population, is undoubtedly one of its most intriguing aspects. A journey through India provides endless opportunities to study many different ethnic groups, the lives of most of whom are interesting, especially those whose ancient costumes and customs have not yet been destroyed by the spread of civilization, making them even more fascinating.

Since time immemorial, foreign peoples have continually invaded India from the land, wave upon wave. The majority later settled in this land, which is why the Indian population is so diverse. Tracing back through history, we know that new ethnic groups have constantly and continuously entered India since historical times. Furthermore, archaeological research has proven that before recorded history, there were people who have now disappeared and whose names have long been forgotten who entered India in a steady stream.

Foreign invasions of India have, without exception, entered through the routes on what is today known as the Northwest Frontier. This is because the seas surrounding India on three sides, in an era when only small boats existed and there were no giant ships, offered no routes for large-scale migration. The northern frontier, meanwhile, has the snow-capped Himalayas as a screen, making it extremely difficult to cross.

In the northwest corner, however, the mountains are relatively low, roads are plentiful, and many are good. Many of the peoples of India, and the armies that have shaped India's history, have entered through this mountain range, such as Alexander the Great of Macedon, the Scythians, and the Muslims who established Muslim kingdoms in southern India.

Even today, the gateway of the Northwest Frontier remains a potential route for invasion into India, just as it was in the past. However, unlike the land frontiers of other countries, India's land border has its own unique characteristics. It is, in fact, not contiguous with the borders of neighboring countries except in two locations.

Generally, borders are based on demarcated lines or natural and terrestrial features such as rivers and mountains. The ethnicity of the inhabitants is also sometimes used to delineate the boundaries. For example, the Indus River, after entering Indian territory, divides the ethnicities of the region along its lower reaches. The Indus River is also one of the most prominent linguistic dividing lines on the Indian subcontinent. To the north of the river live the Pashtuns, who all speak Pashto, although there are many different dialects. They are all Muslims.

The countryside between the Indus River and Afghanistan is called the Northwest Frontier. Its eastern part is the North-West Frontier Province, and its western part is Balochistan. The Durand Line, demarcated by the Anglo-Afghan commission led by Sir Mortimer Durand more than thirty years ago, defines the boundary between the Indian Empire and Afghanistan. The area to the north and west of the line is Afghan territory. The core of India does not extend to the Durand Line. The term India refers to the areas under full modern administration.

Scattered along this 800-mile long frontier and the zone on the Indian side are independent tribes. They recognize no authority other than their own tribal laws and customs and are prone to unruliness. For this reason, military expeditions have been required to subdue them. Aside from this, this tribal zone is essentially another world, isolated from the outside. Its southern edge is called the administrative border, to distinguish it from the true frontier bordering Afghanistan to the north.

The tribal zone is a long chain of mountains, varying in depth. Some areas are as deep as a hundred miles, while others are only forty or fifty miles. Most of the area lacks modern roads suitable for modern vehicles. This zone begins in the north from the Chitral, Swat, and Buna hill regions, passes through Malakand, and reaches the Khyber Pass, continuing westward through Kurram, Tochi, Waziristan, Gomal, and Zhob, and entering Balochistan. From there, a southwestern turn leads across the Makran region and to the Indian Ocean. The ancient Greeks called the Makran region Gedrosia. Alexander the Great's army retreated from India through this region, during which many soldiers perished due to the hardships along the way.

Several rivers crisscross the mountains of the tribal zone, forming historical routes for communication. These rivers are still trade routes, although with advances in road construction technology, trade routes have, in many places, ceased to follow waterways. For example, the main route north into Afghanistan now follows the Khyber Pass. Alexander the Great, however, led his army into India along the Kabul River, northeast of the current road and railway line.

### In Order to Maintain Current Consumption Levels, Gas Customers are Asked to Conserve - Termination of Supply is a Misunderstanding

Usage Restrictions May be Tightened, Prices May be Revised

Recent rumors have circulated that the Shanghai Gas Company (commonly known as the British Gas Company) has terminated gas supply to certain users, leading to various speculations. Yesterday, the reporter specifically inquired about this matter with the responsible person of the company. According to the person, the above rumor is actually due to misunderstandings from various parties, as the company strictly refuses all requests for gas installation from "additional consumers." These measures are aimed at maintaining the normal supply of gas. The company's business continues as usual. The gas consumption of existing users still adopts the restriction measures issued in June of last year, with no changes so far.

New Consumption is Refused

The responsible person also stated that gas production relies entirely on coal. However, since the source of coal has been blocked, the company has had to adjust gas production to adapt to the changing environment. For this reason, it has refused "additional consumers" to avoid increasing the supply of this fuel. On the other hand, in order to reduce unnecessary consumption, restriction measures have been adopted, stipulating that the consumption of all existing users should not exceed the level of the same month in 1940. The excess consumption will be charged at twice the current price for the first time, three times the price for the second time, and four times the price for the third time and above.

Indian Coal Supply Cut Off, Reserves Borrowed

The coal used by the company originally came from India, with an annual consumption of approximately 42,000 tons. After the source was cut off, it relied on reserves in this port. However, since April and May, the supply of coal has not been as smooth as in the past. Therefore, the company's gas production has had to be reduced accordingly. If the supply of coal can continue as it is now, then the company's service to the public can proceed smoothly without being affected in any way.

Prices and Currency System May Change

The reporter further asked whether the company, in addition to refusing new industrial and household users, will tighten consumption restrictions. It was said that in order to plan ahead, taking further measures to tighten consumption is indeed possible. It is hoped that existing users can understand the current difficulties and implement "the most economical consumption" so that both the company and the public can benefit. As for the fees, the company has always considered the burden on the public. It once reduced the charging rate amidst soaring prices. However, in order to adapt to the current living standards, the prices may be revised soon. Users can still use the old legal tender to pay the fees, but according to the company's current expenses, new currency has been adopted for some expenses. Therefore, users may also have to use new currency to pay bills in the future.

### Beggars in Groups - Grab Buns and Money

The Hongyunlou Restaurant on French Avenue ordered 200 buns from a bun stall at the entrance of Tongkang Lane, opposite the slaughterhouse on Avenue des Soeurs, at a price of 40 yuan. After the buns were made at 1:00 PM that afternoon, the stall owner sent his apprentice, Wang Jinqi (16 years old, from Nantong), to deliver the buns to Hongyunlou. While passing in front of the Sino-French School on Avenue des Soeurs, suddenly more than ten beggars came forward and, without asking the reason, robbed all the buns and scattered in all directions. Wang Jinqi was frightened by the robbery and had no face to return to the stall to account for the buns. He was crying on the road when a passerby took pity on him and generously gave Wang Jinqi 10 yuan in banknotes. Wang took the money back, but misfortune did not come singly. After walking a few steps, two Russian beggars, Polyslov (transliteration) and his brother, passed by. Seeing Wang holding banknotes, they had bad intentions and rushed forward to snatch them, running westward. Wang chased after them, shouting "Robber!" At the location of Glock Road, two passersby, Mr. Zhang and Mr. Xu, helped to intercept the two Russian beggars, searched them, found the original banknotes, and called the police to take them to the police station for investigation.

### Sixteen-Year-Old Prostitute Found Dead After Overnight Stay, Client and Brothel Owner Both Detained

In room 406 of the Da Hu Hotel, No. 3 Sanjiao on Rue Edward VII near Dongxin Bridge in the French Concession, a traveler named Lu Wenxin, 32 years old, from Kunshan, engaged in the lime business, often traveled between Kunshan and Shanghai and had a surplus. Yesterday afternoon around 5 o'clock, Lu ordered a waiter to call a prostitute named Xu Didi (16 years old, local) from the Hongxiangyuan second-class brothel to drink and have fun. When it was late at night, they slept together. Unexpectedly, at 4:30 the next morning, the prostitute Didi, taking advantage of Lu's deep sleep, hastily put on her clothes and got out of bed, opened the window, and for some reason, had a sudden impulse, jumped down, and fell into the middle of the road, resulting in a broken neck and brain matter splattered, and died on the spot. After the patrolman arrived, the body was taken to the coroner's office for examination. On the one hand, the police ordered detectives to bring the client Lu Wenxin and the brothel owner to the police station for interrogation and handling.

### Gambling and Commission Extraction at the Central Club on Nanjing Road Leads to Punishment

The Central Club at No. 730 Nanjing Road, for which Mao Zhongyu obtained a license from the Public Works Department, was recently found by the police to be involved in gathering people to gamble and extract commissions for profit. Therefore, Mao Zhongyu was prosecuted according to the law. After interrogation yesterday morning, Mao was sentenced to two months imprisonment and fined 1,000 yuan. The imprisonment can be commuted to a fine at a rate of three yuan per day, and the fine can be commuted to labor service at a rate of six months for the total amount of the fine.

### Abandoned Infants Are Common Due to Financial Hardship

The financial hardship in Shanghai has reached an extreme point. Ordinary poor people who cannot make a living often sell their children, commit suicide, or abandon their children. This is a common sight. There are two unnamed male infants, only two or three months old, who were abandoned by their families in front of No. 413 Route Cardinal Mercier and No. 1089 Route Foch a few days ago. They were taken in by the French police and were both hungry and sick. They were sent to the Guangci Hospital for treatment, but it was ineffective. They died one after another the day before yesterday. The corpses were sent to the coroner's office and handed over to the charity hall for burial. It is truly tragic.

### Plans to Restore Trade with Southeast Asia, Decision to Establish a Control Association

Participating Businesses Must Prepay a Security Deposit

Concrete measures for restoring trade between Shanghai and Southeast Asia are being discussed among relevant parties. Among them, the issue of the control organization and the qualifications for participating in trade has been reviewed repeatedly. The final decision is to adopt the following methods:

Control Organization

Although there were initial suggestions to organize a joint-stock company, it has now been decided to establish the "Shanghai Southeast Asia Trade Control Association." The Import and Export Control Committee will serve as the highest executive body, under which there will be two departments: the Export Department and the Import Department. Under the two departments, divisions will be established according to commodity categories. Each division will be divided into two sections: the first section will handle Japanese business affairs, and the second section will handle Chinese business affairs. All businesses and companies wishing to participate in Southeast Asia trade must prepay a security deposit. The amount is approximately 1,000 to 10,000 Japanese yen per commodity for each business.

Participating Qualifications

On the Japanese business side, only those with strength in Southeast Asia trade, with branches or representative offices in various parts of Southeast Asia, or with liaison offices in various parts of Southeast Asia, or with commercial influence in Shanghai, may participate. In order to facilitate contact and negotiation with overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia, Chinese companies and businesses will also be allowed to participate. In the past, most Chinese businesses operating in Southeast Asia trade were represented by British and American companies. In the future, they will be handled by Japanese businesses.

### Chinese Leprosy Sanatorium is Run by Chinese, Dr. Harry Harbour Neeld Never Managed Finances, Now Completely Separated from the Sanatorium

Yesterday, Mr. Wu, the general secretary of the Chinese Leprosy Sanatorium, stated to the newspaper reporter that the association was originally located in Dachang and moved to Avenue du Roi Albert after the war. The American doctor Harry Harbour Neeld only served as the honorary president of the sanatorium and did not receive a salary, nor did he participate in the sanatorium's finances. Dr. Neeld has now completely separated from the sanatorium, and Wen Lanting has been hired as the honorary president, Dr. Yue Wenzhao as the president, and Dr. Zhou Liangquan as the chief of medical affairs. All directors are also Chinese. Therefore, the Chinese Leprosy Sanatorium is purely supported by Chinese. The record in a certain Western newspaper is slightly inconsistent with the facts. In addition, the recent situation of the sanatorium is briefly recorded as follows:

Source of Funds

The leprosy patient shelter currently located at No. 16 Route du Roi Albert is the temporary hospital of the largest Chinese Leprosy Sanatorium in Dachang, and is completely sponsored by the Chinese Leprosy Relief Association. All its expenses, in addition to the subsidies from the Public Concession's Public Works Department and the French Concession's Municipal Council and donations from various parties, are entirely borne by the association. Dr. Harry Harbour Neeld was only hired by the association as the acting honorary president and has been dismissed by the association's board of directors. Mr. Wen Lanting was newly hired as the honorary president, and Dr. Yue Wenzhao as the president. In the past, Dr. Neeld's work was only in medical and religious aspects, and he never managed finances. As for the Shanghai Leprosy Clinic at No. 41 Rue du Père Huc, it was initially jointly operated by the Chinese Medical Association and the Chinese Leprosy Relief Association, and later taken over by the Xin Zha Sanitary Experimental District. However, the Chinese Leprosy Relief Association still provides financial assistance. Dr. Neeld was only an advisor to the clinic and not the person in charge.

Number of Patients

Ten years ago, the Chinese Leprosy Relief Association had a leprosy clinic in Xiangyanqiao, Zhabei. More than one hundred people went to see the doctor every week. At that time, a field survey was conducted with the Municipal Health Bureau, and it was learned that there were no less than 2,000 people suffering from leprosy in the city of Shanghai. Recently, Shanghai has been affected by the war, and the population has surged. The number of leprosy patients has therefore increased, without any doubt. Therefore, the Chinese Leprosy Sanatorium shelter in West Shanghai and the Shanghai Leprosy Clinic on Rue du Père Huc are insufficient, and it is necessary to expand the scope. However, at a time when the cost of living is high and the source of funds is cut off, the funds of the two institutions are extremely lacking. The association hopes that people from all walks of life will generously donate to provide continuous assistance so that this important work can be maintained.

### Spreading Lime in Graves Can Be Handled by the Health Department

The Public Works Department's Information Office announced that the bureau will issue a notice that anyone wishing to spread lime inside the graves in the public cemetery can have the Health Department handle it on their behalf. The cost is 50 yuan per grave.

### Man Commits Suicide by Jumping from Building

In front of No. 72 Rue Hua Long in the French Concession, at about 3:20 PM the other day, a young man, about 24 or 25 years old, wearing a navy blue serge suit, gray flannel pants, and yellow leather shoes, for some unknown reason, suddenly committed suicide, jumped from the third floor, and fell next to the curb on the road. His brains were splattered on the spot, and he died instantly. After the patrolmen arrived, they searched a yellow wallet from his pocket, which contained 70 yuan in reserve tickets, 7 yuan in old legal currency, and a gold chicken heart pin with a photo of himself embedded in it. There was nothing else. After the police officers rushed to investigate, they moved the body to the small ward coroner's office and visited the family to claim the body for burial.

### Dancer Returns to Old Entanglements After Escaping from the Brothel

Sun Lili, a woman from Pudong, is currently twenty years old. When she was four years old, she was bought by a woman named Sun Suzhen to be her adopted daughter. When Sun was fourteen years old, Sun Suzhen sold her to a brothel in a lane for 300 yuan to become a prostitute. Last spring, the brothel closed, and Miss Sun escaped from the brothel and regained her freedom. She then went to a dance school to learn to dance. After graduating, she joined the Yangtze Dance Hall as a dancer. Recently, Sun Suzhen learned that her daughter had become a dancer and had some savings, so she often pestered her. One day, taking advantage of the girl's absence, she secretly moved away the girl's clothing and accessories worth more than a thousand yuan, and was still not satisfied. Sun Suzhen's lover, Mao Guofang, gathered several hooligans and invited the girl to room 241 of the Mengyuan Hotel on Hubei Road the other day to extort 3,000 yuan to settle the matter, otherwise, they would use various means to obstruct the girl's actions. The girl felt that Sun Suzhen's methods were too vicious, so she angrily reported to the Xinzha police station. Detective Ma Zigan went to Mengyuan and arrested two hooligans, Lu Zhenshan and Zhu Gongming. After confessing, they went to room 7 of the Geng'an Hotel at No. 579 Avenue Edward VII and arrested Mao Guofang and a Wu Gengfu. However, the principal offender, Sun Suzhen, was at large. The arrested criminals were all taken into custody to be investigated together after Sun was arrested.

### Home Storing Two Loads of Rice Suffers Extortion

Ye Yongcai, a Ningbo native who resides at No. 188 Broadway and runs an antique shop, has considerable savings. He recently purchased two loads of rice and stored them in the kitchen. This was known to Ge Du, a Ningbo woman who lived nearby. Knowing that Ye Yongcai was timid, she contacted the escaped gangsters Fang Shengfa, Xu Atu, and Zhu Haigen. At 8:00 PM on the 3rd of this month, Fang Shengfa, together with Xu and Zhu, and a Korean man, as well as Ningbo natives Xu Asan and Pan Asan as interpreters, carrying a pair of handcuffs, claimed to be inspectors from a certain agency and rushed in to intimidate Ye, saying, "You are hoarding rice and failing to register, violating the ban. If you want to avoid trouble, you must pay 20,000 yuan as a birthday gift, otherwise it will be very dangerous." Ye was anxious and unable to cope. At this time, the neighbor Ge Du came to mediate. As a result, he was extorted 5,000 yuan in legal currency. After the case was discovered, Detective Zhang Yunsheng and detectives Wang Lansheng and Zhang Jiucheng of the Wayside police station arrested Xu Asan, Pan Asan, and Ge Du yesterday and brought them to court. The verdict is scheduled to be announced on the morning of the 28th.

### Serial Robbers Arrested, Master Thief Caught

Wang Rusong, the Chinese Detective Inspector of the French General Police Station, detectives Wang Wenwei, Qin Bichang, Kang Hui, etc., received a tip-off the other day that a large number of bandits were hiding in the Yongchang Inn at No. 16 Route du P. Froc and in the Shuiju Inn on Avenue de l'Amiral Courbet. They rushed to the above two locations without revealing their presence, broke into the inns, and arrested the bandit gang Shaoxing native Zhang Maozhong (nicknamed "Xiao Niupi"), Lin Amao (i.e., Mao Mao), Lin Alin and his wife Lin Xia, and local Zhang Yongkang, a total of five people. They also found a real and a fake handgun under the bed. They took them to the police station. According to Zhang, they confessed that they had robbed a foreign cloth store at No. 485 Avenue Edouard VII and robbed Zhou Xuelian, a dancer at the Lido Dance Hall, of about 500 yuan in dance tickets and cash, as well as clothing and other items worth more than a thousand yuan from a household at No. 47 Tingyun Lane on Route Lafayette, and more than ten other cases. The police chief ordered them to be taken into custody to investigate and summon the victims to conduct a detailed investigation, track down the stolen goods, and then conduct further investigations.

### Man Arrested for Hiding Opium

An old woman from Chongming, Shi Zhu, 64 years old, bought five liang of opium for 700 yuan at the Lao Qichang opium firm in Jiumudi the other day and hid it on her body. When she was passing through the iron gate of Dongxin Bridge in the French Concession, she was arrested and searched. She looked suspicious and was stopped for investigation. The opium was found and taken to the police station. According to her, she was entrusted by a Mr. Wu to take it to the countryside to sell. The police chief ordered her to be taken into custody for investigation.

### Community Service

### Letter

To the Editor: According to my client, Mr. Jiang Zhongjia, the "Water Cut Dispute by Landlord of Dalu Lane" news published in the Shen Bao on April 26 is not in accordance with the facts. There are more than 50 buildings in Dalu Lane, and the rent for each building is only about 40 or 50 yuan in old legal currency, with a total monthly rental income of 2,687.46 yuan. However, the monthly water bill for the entire lane is more than 1,000 yuan. In addition, the monthly land rent and other expenses are 2,555 yuan. Zhongjia, unable to bear the losses, repeatedly consulted with the tenants last year, and the tenants finally agreed to pay the water bill themselves. Unexpectedly, in the first month (December last year), they did not fulfill the agreement. Zhongjia's family is not wealthy, how can he continue? He then negotiated with the tenants again and agreed to install water meters so that customers could pay the water bill separately. The meter installation fee was 220 yuan per household, of which Zhongjia paid one-third and the tenants paid two-thirds, which would be returned by Zhongjia when they moved out. Unexpectedly, after all the installation procedures were completed, the tenants ignored it again. For several months, the monthly water bill was more than 1,000 yuan. The tenants refused to pay, and Zhongjia was unable to pay the difference. If the water company cuts off the water supply, it is due to the tenants' refusal to pay the water bill as agreed, and the tenants should be responsible for it. Zhongjia is deeply afraid of causing disputes, so on the 17th of this month, he presented a detailed account of the matter to the French Concession Municipal Council's Rent Committee for record. The report that Zhongjia arbitrarily cut off the water supply because he failed to increase the rent is not true. He has entrusted a representative to send a letter to correct it. I have always admired your newspaper's commitment to justice, so I am sending this letter for your consideration and publication to clarify the truth. Thank you very much. To the Shen Bao, Attorney Zhou Xiao'an, April 28.

Yesterday, the newspaper was distributed at 6:30 PM.

### Another New Type of Vehicle

People living in a tense environment, if they can plan for themselves and adapt to the environment, there is always a way. Apart from anything else, just take the means of transportation as an example. Since private cars have been suspended, bicycles have become popular. This type of vehicle has also evolved into various types of vehicles. Some have attached seats on the side, and some have them at the back; some have three wheels, and some have four wheels. In addition to comfort, they also need to be aesthetically pleasing and fast. The more you plan, the more you can enjoy. It goes without saying. The bicycle in the picture has a sedan body attached to the side, which is much more unique than using a boat-shaped wicker basket.

### One Dollar Torn Notes Still Accepted as Usual: Silver Union to Stop Exchange - Effective May 1st

The Provisional Joint Association of Silver and Money Businesses in this city sent a circular to all banks and firms yesterday, stating, "We have received a letter from the Joint Preparatory Committee, stating, 'Recently, one-dollar notes are extremely scarce in the Shanghai market, causing great inconvenience to businesses. Merchants seeking to purchase one-dollar notes on the market must pay approximately 100 yuan extra for every 1,000 yuan. We believe that among the damaged notes received by our association for exchange, many of the one-dollar notes are only slightly damaged. These notes can still circulate in the market. Our association suggests temporarily suspending the exchange of damaged one-dollar notes, and resuming exchange when the quantity of one-dollar notes in the market increases. Please consider and advise on the feasibility of this proposal.' Upon review, the shortage of one-dollar notes is indeed due to a lack of supply. However, the market refuses to accept even slightly damaged notes, making circulation even more difficult. The association's proposal to suspend the exchange of damaged one-dollar notes is a temporary remedy. However, all banks and firms should accept one-dollar notes that are not severely damaged as much as possible, so that the market can circulate more easily and alleviate some of the difficulties. We have heard that all banks and firms are already accepting and issuing damaged one-dollar notes as usual. We hope that all citizens will accept and use them to alleviate the single-note panic. The bank preparatory committee has decided to temporarily suspend the exchange of damaged one-dollar notes starting from May 1st."

### Public Sentiment Rises: Spot Gold Re-Surges

Yesterday, the spot gold market re-surged, with prices nearing the 22,000 yuan mark. Certain gold shops suddenly entered the market to buy, and silver shops also showed strong buying interest. With military notes rising, public sentiment in all quarters was generally optimistic, and trading was quite active. The opening price in the morning was 20,600 yuan per tael (ten liang), up 100 yuan immediately. Securities firms and gold shops came to buy, and silver shops also showed strong buying interest. Sellers held back, and prices soared by 1,400 yuan, reaching a high of 22,000 yuan. Spot gold shops aggressively sold at limit prices, while silver shops and another securities firm (from Tianjin) sold off, causing prices to fall by 800 yuan to 21,200 yuan. At noon, gold shops and silver shops re-entered the market to buy, and with military notes rising, the noon price had risen to 21,800 yuan with few sellers, up 1,300 yuan from the previous day. The intraday price difference was 1,400 yuan. In the afternoon, prices rose again to 22,200 yuan.

The selling price of gold jewelry in silver shops was adjusted five times by Da Xin and its peers, eventually reaching 2,300 yuan per liang, a total increase of 150 yuan (buying price reduced by 300 yuan). Refined silver was quoted at 18 yuan, while the black market price ranged from 16.5 yuan to 17 yuan. Silver coins were quoted at 9.5 yuan each.

### Foreign Currencies Rise Across the Board

Yesterday, in the foreign currency market, British and American gold pounds each rose by 20 yuan, the former to 480 yuan and the latter to 490 yuan. American dollar bills were in demand at 33.5 yuan. Hong Kong dollar bills rose sharply to 5.2 yuan, with large bills trading one jiao lower. Military notes suddenly surged, opening at 7.12 yuan, retreating to 7.1 yuan after the opening, and then rising to 7.44 yuan in the afternoon, closing at 7.35 yuan, up 0.22 yuan from the previous day.

Yesterday, the interest rate for interbank loans in the Money Trade Association remained at 0.13 yuan, unchanged. The discount rate for "劃頭" (drawing head) notes suddenly increased to 10 yuan per thousand, up 0.07 or 0.08 yuan. The difference between old and new legal tender was 0.295 to 0.305 yuan per yuan.

### Public Bonds Short Selling: Disregarding Price

In the over-the-counter public bond market yesterday, because more bonds were expected to be issued in the future, many parties were absorbing them. Although the market was not weak, it could not withstand the pressure. The volume of selling was not very large, but the demand for absorption was not enough to meet supply. Furthermore, those who were cutting losses were even more eager to sell, and short sellers were selling off regardless of price, causing the market price to plummet. After opening at 2 yuan, Series C bonds immediately broke down. At 1 yuan, there was a long competition between buying and selling before it finally broke down, reaching a low price of 0.605 yuan. Series E bonds were very stable at 8 yuan, but suddenly closed at 7.4 yuan, which was a deliberate attempt by the short sellers to lower the price. The price was therefore unrealistic and should not be taken as a standard. There is no reason for 5,000 transactions to cause a sharp drop of 0.6 yuan. Other types of bonds did not exhibit this phenomenon, which proves the point. Yesterday, the sellers were mostly Tongli, with Hongxing and Fuyuan also selling. Qianyi and Hu Heji were mostly closing out positions. Xiekang had frequent ins and outs, with overall selling being more. The buyers were mostly Baolong, followed by Lianyi. Jiufeng, Tongkang, and Xufeng had uncertain movements, with overall buying being more. As a result of the competition, supply exceeded demand, and prices generally fell by 0.06, 0.07 yuan to several jiao or one yuan, with Series E falling by 1.6 yuan being the most. The total transaction volume was approximately one million yuan. A simplified table is listed below.

### Stocks Still Advancing to New Peaks

Yesterday, the trading volume of foreign stocks decreased. The morning volume was 30,100 shares, and the afternoon volume was 15,400 shares. Prices mostly continued to advance towards new peaks.

### Raw Cotton Hard to Cheapen: Yarn Market Turns Upward

The cotton yarn market has turned upward again, due to the difficulty in cheapening raw materials and the tight supply of existing goods. 42-count Blue Phoenix traded at 12,500 yuan to 12,730 yuan. 42-count Bao Guang traded at 12,250 yuan. 42-count Yang He traded at 12,500 yuan to 12,245 yuan. 32-count Xian Tao traded at 9,500 yuan. 32-count Xian Tao double-strand traded at 11,450 yuan. 32-count Shuang Ma traded at 9,400 yuan. 20-count Shui Yue traded at 6,500 yuan. 20-count Blue Phoenix traded at 6,850 yuan. 20-count Yue Qin traded at 6,150 yuan. 20-count Shuang Ma traded at 6,000 yuan to 6,100 yuan. 20-count Shuang Di Qiu traded at 6,050 yuan to 6,100 yuan. 16-count Da Bao traded at 5,500 yuan. 16-count Hong Kui Xing traded at 5,790 yuan. 16-count Jin Ta traded at 6,000 yuan. 16-count Fei Ji traded at 5,900 yuan. 14-count Yu Ta traded at 5,900 yuan. 18-count Zhi Nv traded at 6,000 yuan. 10-count Fu Yan traded at 4,650 yuan. 10-count Hong Shuang Ma traded at 4,500 yuan to 4,600 yuan. 10-count Shuang Di Qiu traded at 4,180 yuan to 4,200 yuan. 10-count Hong Bao Yi traded at 4,300 yuan to 4,350 yuan. 10-count Tong Zi Jun traded at 4,450 yuan to 4,520 yuan.

As a result of the consultation, it was said that each company would contribute 2,000 yuan. It was originally planned to open as usual today, but unexpectedly there were changes along the way, and business could not be restored. However, speculators were very enthusiastic, and the black market rose again from 5,280 yuan to 5,300 yuan. In the afternoon, it rose even further.

### Talk of Reopening Trading Exchanges: Quicker Increase in Cloth Prices

Factory Cloth: Yesterday, the cloth market, due to the soaring prices of Eastern cloth and the tightening supply, saw prices rise after an initial period of stability. 16-pound Earth coarse cloth traded at 260 yuan, and Flying Goose at 248 yuan, both extremely scarce. 12-pound Zhen Zhong fine cloth traded at 135 yuan, also extremely scarce. 12-pound Fugui fine cloth rose from 216 yuan to 220 yuan, and Earth fine cloth traded at 226 yuan. Peach Girl, Chick, and other brands of Shilin opened at 347 yuan in the morning and 350 yuan in the afternoon, with demand exceeding supply, up about 5 yuan. Changshou Fuchou traded at 7.6 yuan, Changting at 7.45 yuan, Yuemei New Stripe at 6 yuan, and Volleyball at 5.7 yuan.

Eastern Cloth: Yesterday, market news stated that the trading exchange had been scheduled to reopen on the fourth of next month, causing great excitement. The bulls were even more excited, because there were not many shares of each cloth, especially the medium-grade fine cloth, which rose the fastest, up 7.5 yuan to 10 yuan per bolt. For example, Rainbow Ball fine cloth closed at 246.5 yuan, Flying Fish at 243 yuan, and Yanghe at 240 yuan. As for the Longtou fine cloth, new orders opened at 268 yuan in the morning and closed at 273 yuan, up about 7 yuan per bolt. The Four Gentlemen serge red order was the most traded, and the price was also the firmest, closing at 9.2 yuan, up 0.27 yuan per yard.

### Spring Rain Causes Rice Merchants to Hesitate

Continuous spring rain has made it impossible for porters to transport rice, resulting in a sparse arrival of domestic rice and higher asking prices. Early and late rice, in the French Concession, initially traded from 505 yuan, then 508 yuan, reaching 510 yuan to 511 yuan. In the British Concession, it traded from 526 yuan and 527 yuan to around 530 yuan. Thick japonica rice traded at 530 yuan to 535 yuan. Since the market authorities issued an order to stop trading, the merchants have had no place to gather and have dispersed. Therefore, there is a lack of reliable information regarding prices in various places. It was rumored the day before yesterday that they would move to a certain park to resume over-the-counter trading, but this seems to be a temporary agreement among a small number of people and may not be as natural as in the past.

### Orchid and Bamboo Branches: Both Production and Inventory are Scarce

Orchid and bamboo branch producers report that existing inventory is almost depleted, leading to higher handling fees and external expenses. Shenhao's inventory is also low, but due to certain circumstances, transportation to and from the northern areas of the Upper River is temporarily difficult, preventing prices from rising accordingly.

### Movie Fans Adore Directors: Evidence of Improved Viewing Habits

— Xin

According to Hollywood experts who study film art, many movie fans recently have shown great admiration for the directing skills of famous directors. As a result of this mindset, they have shown excessive admiration for some directors and have begun to focus on who directed a particular film.

It is not surprising that movie stars have long been admired by movie fans. However, since the history of film began, Hollywood male and female filmmakers who have been considered big stars, such as Gary Cooper, Clark Gable, Taylor Power, Spencer Tracy, Pinky Babe, Claudette Colbert, Bette Davis, and Mona Law, approximately 50 to 60 actors, have been admired because they frequently appeared on the screen and met with movie fans. Now, however, people who have been hiding behind the screen and have never met movie fans in their lives are also being admired by movie fans, which can certainly be regarded as a peculiar thing.

Currently, the big directors in Hollywood who are admired include William Wyler, Cecil B. DeMille, Frank Capra, George Cukor, La Cava, Francis Ford Coppola, and Wistler Grieger, at least a dozen or more. They have never been on the screen, but they are admired by movie fans just like movie stars, and they often receive letters from movie fans they do not know, expressing their great admiration for their directing techniques.

Even many movie fans watch films without asking who the stars of the film are, but only pay attention to who directed the film. If the director is someone they admire, they will unconsciously rush to see the film. Who stars in it does not matter, so a film made by a famous director can attract many moviegoers. Undoubtedly, the fact that movie fans have begun to pay attention to directing techniques is evidence of a further step in improving their viewing habits. In general, this trend will become more and more prevalent in the future.

### After Seeing "Four Sisters"

— Tan Feng

The Li family has four daughters. Xiulian has a stubborn personality and is a frugal elementary school teacher. Xiufang loves vanity and eventually regrets it. Xiuhua is a tomboy who later becomes a hospital nurse. Xiurong is innocent and lively and eventually marries her sister's lover.

The entire play has five acts, and the director has handled it very well. Each act ends powerfully, with the fourth act being the most exciting. When Xiuhua leaves, she slams the table, expressing her determination, and a clap of thunder immediately follows, startling the audience and making it exceptionally wonderful.

The four sisters are played by Zhang Fan, Sally, Shen Hao, and Chen Qi respectively, truly a perfect combination. Chen Qi sings well, and her warbling voice has earned her many cheers. If she could be more active, making Xiufang's vain contours more clear to the audience, it would be even better.

Qiao Qi's Wu Huaiyuan is very successful. He plays the talented and arrogant character flawlessly. The country tycoon Wang Defa, played by Jiang Shan, is like Zheng Guoguang and Mei Shaoye in "Spring," making the audience roar with laughter. Qiu Quan's father and Ge's rice store owner are also commendable.

The weaknesses are very minor. At the end of the third act, when Xiufang slaps her fiancé Jingsheng in anger, not many characters in the audience react, and this high point is lightly dissipated, which is a pity. Especially the fact that Jingsheng's father is not moved at all seems somewhat careless.

The music helps to advance the plot, earning the audience a lot of praise. Ending the comedy of the four sisters with "My Family" satisfies the audience.

In short, "Four Sisters" is a good play that continues the success of "The Hunchback of Notre Dame" and is worth recommending to readers.

### The Composition Process of "Peacock Flies Southeast"

— Lan Tian

"Peacock Flies Southeast" has been performed in Peking opera and film in the past, but it seems that formal public performances of the play have not been seen in various places to this day. In fact, such a meaningful and excellent source material for a family tragedy should not be ignored. Now I finally dare to take on the responsibility of composing this script.

I have not seen the Peking opera and film versions of "Peacock Flies Southeast." It can be said that writing this script simply took the outline of the story, removed the dross, and selected its essence to create a plot. Another part was completely created by myself, so I believe that the content of this script is completely different from the Peking opera and film versions. Now I can briefly discuss its theme and plot.

"Peacock Flies Southeast" is a blood and tears history of resistance against feudal ethics. Although the deaths of Zhongqing and Lanzhi sacrificed two young people, how many more than just one pair were sacrificed! Thousands of young people have followed in their footsteps. This is certainly a heavy loss, but at the same time, it has also gained even greater gains, that is, the freedom and liberation of trillions of young people today. Recalling this point, we grieve, and we are also encouraged.

Therefore, I have strongly revealed the evils of the old ethics in the social background, strongly indicating the social background between the lines, using anti-feudalism as the theme of this script.

The plot is simply like this: Zhongqing and Lanzhi have a very deep relationship, but the mother-in-law is fierce and often abuses them. Lanzhi knows that it is difficult to be a daughter-in-law, but she endures it with tears. One day, due to some reason, there is a disagreement between the mother-in-law and daughter-in-law, and the mother-in-law angrily drives the daughter-in-law out. Helpless, the two make an agreement before parting, as firm as a rock, as soft as a reed, meaning that they will swear to stick together and wait for the mother-in-law to forgive them before reuniting. After Lanzhi is driven back to her parents' home, she is deeply disapproved of by her father and brothers. Her brother, who is usually harsh and shameless, forces her to become a concubine in a wealthy family. Lanzhi refuses, but is powerless to resist and attempts to kill herself by cutting her throat with scissors. Her mother takes the scissors, but she is injured. One stormy night, Zhongqing mistakenly believes that Lanzhi has married and secretly enters at night, coldly ridiculing her for being unfeeling and breaking her promise. After Lanzhi explains herself again and again, Zhongqing finally understands. Just then, her brother breaks in drunkenly, sees Zhongqing, and hates him extremely. He tries to stab him with a knife, but misses. Her mother arrives and stops him, and Zhongqing and Lanzhi flee in the middle of the night. In the vast dark night, surrounded by enemies, at the end of their rope, they finally embrace and throw themselves into the water, becoming a pair of doomed lovebirds.

After "Peacock Flies Southeast" was completed, Mr. Tang Huaiqiu praised it very much and was willing to perform it with the strongest cast, which made me feel extremely ashamed.

### Southern Ballads

— Ze Fu

Southern ballads are popular in eastern and western Zhejiang, named to distinguish them from the drum ballads of the north. What is called "Siming Documents" in Shanghai is actually the southern ballad sung by Ningbo people. In Ningbo, it is still called the southern ballad. Its lyrics are also a type of ballad singing, but the instruments used when singing are different from the ballads sung in Suzhou and Shanghai. The custom in Hangzhou refers to southern ballads as "reciting ancient and modern books and composing seven-character sentences. The person sitting in the middle strums the strings, and the dulcimer player assists. Each book has four or five episodes and is called a storyteller." It is said that in addition to one person playing the sanxian and singing, there must also be one person to assist with the dulcimer, unlike the simple use of the sanxian by the people of Suzhou. In addition, there are also three-piece and five-piece ensembles, where, in addition to the sanxian and dulcimer, there are also erhu, pipa, and yueqin to assist. However, usually one "person" is the main requirement. What is sung is nothing more than tender and sentimental love stories, such as "Legend of the White Snake," "Pearl Tower," and "Third Smile Marriage." There is a small introduction before the singing, much like the opening of a ballad singing. However, the opening is often unrelated to the text of the book, while the small introduction is sure to summarize the main idea of the book.

### Sharing the Same Boat in Storm

— He Jia Zhi

(4) In the Lingering Sunset

Wei Cheng listened to their warbling voices, and when they spoke, their tongues were not hindered at all, but fluent and clear. As soon as she finished speaking, she could not help but press her white and tender hand: "Look at my family, who else can I discuss with? Sister Cuizhen cannot participate in the slightest bit of written opinion. You say that I am asking a blind man, but I say that we are two blind men, so let us grope forward." Regardless of whether Guofang was willing, she went to retrieve the news reference materials and put them on the table, reading them one by one. Cuizhen walked in and saw them discussing the obituary, and then flashed out. Guofang saw Cuizhen coming in and then saw Cuizhen going out, so she traced behind her and said, "Sister Cuizhen, let us go outside for a walk. When a person arrives at a place that they have never been to before, they must always take a look." She took Cuizhen's arm and walked out of the gate. The yellow dog barked at Guofang, and Cuizhen shouted at it, and the yellow dog curled its tail and walked away. The oncoming wind brought a bit of chill, and Guofang smiled: "Sister Cuizhen, are you not cold wearing so few clothes?" Cuizhen said: "I am not cold, even when I am washing rice and vegetables, I am not cold. Miss Chen, you are not wearing much more than me either." Guofang pinched Cuizhen and said, "I am wearing more than you, a cotton undershirt and a velvet cord vest. It looks thin, but it is not. Sister Cuizhen, these big trees here are not small, how many years have they been here?" Cuizhen said: "We have seen them this big since we were little. There used to be crow nests in the trees, and they would call people and disturb them at dusk, but they have not been here for the past two years." Guofang looked up at the tree tops, and then lowered her gaze and looked into the distance, "Is all the land east and west of here Ye's?" Cuizhen said: "Some of it is, some of it is not." (62)
