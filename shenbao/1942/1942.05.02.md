### US Sends Note to Hungary

Geneva, Switzerland, April 30, Havas News Agency: The Neue Zürcher Zeitung reports that its correspondent in Budapest claims that the US government has asked a neutral country to deliver a note to Hungary. Although the exact content is unknown, it is generally believed that it is nothing more than another warning to Hungary that the United States is very dissatisfied if it continues to help Germany fight against the Soviet Union. The Hungarian reply generally stated that Hungary is fighting for self-defense and has no territorial demands on the Soviet Union. However, it firmly believes that if Soviet troops are allowed to advance westward, they will definitely not stop at the Hungarian border. Hungary has been pursuing an anti-communist policy for 20 years and finds it difficult to change.

### British Newspaper Advocates Establishing a "Foreign Affairs Department"

London, April 30, Havas News Agency: The Times published a surprising editorial today, advocating the establishment of a "Foreign Affairs Department" to oversee the existing Foreign Office and various departments directly and indirectly related to foreign affairs. At that time, the existing Foreign Office will become a purely "Foreign Relations Department," while the newly established "Foreign Affairs Department" will be responsible for determining British foreign policy, in order to relieve the government of direct responsibility for foreign policy. The newspaper's rationale is that "Britain's technical capacity cannot cover everything in relation to all current issues."

### Special Topic on the Indian Question

10. The Northwestern Frontier of India (4)

Geographically speaking, the central part of the frontier is the most interesting. Of course, there is no fixed administrative jurisdiction here. Tribal peoples set their own laws to resolve internal disputes, similar to the Sami people of ancient Scandinavia. The life of a man is extremely valuable, but the life of a woman is worthless. People who have been expelled from the protection of the law can be restored. Sometimes tribal feuds occur, and when the number of deaths on both sides is equal, peace is restored, just like the people of Iceland 1,500 years ago.

From Bannu, there is a highway along the Tochi River to Datakhel, near the Afghan border. A new highway in Waziristan, a few miles from the Afghan border, turns westward in a circular shape, running through the Wazir and Mahsud districts, and finally returning to Kilichi in the Dulai Qilla district within the administrative area. The highway connects with the railway here. From Bannu to Dulai Ismail Khel, the capital of the Dulai Qilla district, there is a car road or a train. However, taking the train requires crossing the Indus River back and forth, making the journey longer.

Dulai Qilla is a typical plain area on the frontier, at the foot of the tribal mountains. When the weather is cool, there are black dots everywhere on the plain, which are the black wool tents of the Powindah people. They all come here from Afghanistan along the Gomal River valley. When passing through the Wazir district, they may even kill and plunder, because robbing caravans is also the hereditary occupation of the Basan people. Caravans, of course, travel in groups, and the Afghan Powindah people are also brave and good at fighting, so there must be battles when they are robbed. In their own tribal areas, everyone in the Powindah people has a rifle. After arriving in the Dulai Qilla plain, some of them still have firearms, because the Mahsud people often infiltrate the plain to rob, and the Powindah people are more likely to be robbed if they have no weapons at all.

The Gomal district has a highway to the Sartman fortress, where troops are stationed in the Zhob River valley in Balochistan. The highway winds down from here, and people go to the Zhob River valley headquarters, to Loralai in the northern section of the ring railway in Balochistan, and then connect with the railway. The ring railway is one of the great achievements of railway construction in the world. Through the abyss, there are spider-web-shaped railway bridges, and the construction of vertical stone walls on the side is huge.

If you take a large car from Dulai Qilla to Zhob, you must return from Dulai Ismail Khan or Bannu, then go south to the Indus River Bridge in Sukkur. There is a sluice gate near Sukkur, and most of the Sindh Desert will soon be turned into fertile grain-growing land, just like the Aswan Sluice Gate in Egypt. After the railway crosses the Indus River Bridge, it passes through Sibi and over the Bolan Pass to Quetta. The Baloch and Brahui people here are closest to the tribal peoples in the Old Testament. After passing through Quetta, the railway passes through the Khojak Pass to Chaman in Afghanistan. There is no tribal area in Balochistan, so the entire administrative area extends to the Durand Line, which is the opposite of the policy adopted by the British in the Northwest Frontier Province.

The terrain of Balochistan is much higher than the rest of the frontier. Every winter, the leaves fall, the fields are covered with white snow, and the ice is hard. But in the spring, there are many flowers and fruits, because the snow on the high mountains gradually melts, and the stony and dry land is irrigated, which is quite fertile, and apricots and peaches are abundant. Since Balochistan is an administrative area, there is no tribal area, and its people are not as fierce as those in the northern border areas, so travel restrictions are much looser. Travelers can travel everywhere without having to take precautions as in other areas of the frontier.

If a traveler tours India in the winter and finishes the tour of the frontier at the end of spring, then they can go to Balochistan and take a train from Quetta for 24 hours to Karachi to take a boat, because at that time, the rest of India will gradually become hot and unbearable.

There are two trade routes in Balochistan that run through it. One in the south enters Afghanistan and goes to eastern Iran. Although there are cars running between Chaman, the border post of Balochistan, and Kandahar, the southern city of Afghanistan, caravans still come east on this trade route, the same as they have for thousands of years.

The monsoon is the lifeblood of India, but Balochistan is outside the monsoon zone, so there is little rainfall, the land is dry, and although the terrain is high, it is barren and there are no dense pine and palm forests. However, when the winter snow accumulates thickly, the silver light shines, which is very beautiful.

No matter how different the terrain and the people are, this is still part of the northwestern frontier of India. The land is strong and the people are fierce. The impression of India will not be real without visiting the frontier of India, including the area from North Waziristan to Quetta. India's past was established from the northwest, and its future history must also rely on the northwest and the people on the frontier, as well as the guards of the various gates.

India's art and scholarship are produced in the leisure life of southern India. The northwest has always contributed little to this, because people are leisurely and free, and can shift their thoughts and energy to more beautiful things, so that art and scholarship can be produced. The people in the northwest have never had leisure and freedom, and have always lived in the midst of war for centuries, so that the people in India behind them can live in peace.

Just as to understand England, one must know the ocean and its relationship to England's history and system, to understand the whole of India, one must inspect the four frontiers and make an investigation. (End of this article)

### German Army Intensifies Preparations
Will Launch Offensive with Full Force
### Soviets Claim to Have Sunk Large German Ship

Stockholm, Sweden, April 30, Havas News Agency: The Swedish Daily News recently published a dispatch from its Berlin correspondent stating that the German army is currently intensifying large-scale preparations to launch a spring offensive on the Eastern Front with full force, ensuring that the Red Army cannot escape. The German General Staff is paying special attention to transportation issues. People in Berlin often say that the date of the spring offensive and its fate depend on how this fundamental problem is solved. In previous battles, the supply of the front line has never been a problem. The baggage train followed the combat troops and advanced at the same time. However, the German side has decided to adopt a different method in the future spring offensive, namely, setting up supply stations in various locations on the front line, pre-stocking weapons, ammunition, and various foods. Once the offensive begins, there is no need for the baggage train to set off with the army. In addition, thousands of newly enlisted youth corps are still in the barracks, and reservists are not being conscripted for the time being. It is generally believed that it seems that they do not want to mobilize a large number of troops before the offensive is launched. However, as soon as the German army unexpectedly launches a sudden attack, these troops will be transferred to the battlefield to fight. At present, transportation to the Soviet Union is very convenient. On the one hand, the Soviet railway has been able to adapt to the German system, and on the other hand, German air transport has become more developed. Germany owns many giant aircraft that can transport soldiers and even small tanks. There are currently eight mechanized units belonging to the air force, and more will be added in the future. In addition, the so-called spring offensive does not only refer to the Soviet Union. Britain and North Africa are also often mentioned by people in Berlin. The German General Staff's active preparations in the West, especially in northern Norway, cannot always be regarded as purely defensive in nature.

### Soviet Troops Attack the Orel Region

Berlin, April 30, Havas News Agency: According to military sources here, Soviet troops have launched constant large-scale attacks in recent days in an attempt to occupy a certain area northeast of Orel City. They attacked with tanks again last night, but it still failed, with extremely heavy losses in personnel and materiel. Also, in a certain area of the Orel front, Soviet troops once broke through the German defense line. After a fierce counterattack by the German army, the Soviet troops were still unable to withstand it and retreated.

Moscow, 1st Day: The Soviet war report stated that on April 30, there were no major changes on the front line. On April 29, 31 German aircraft were destroyed, and we lost 11 aircraft. In the Barents Sea area, our warships sank a German transport ship of 18,000 tons.

Helsinki, Finland, April 30, Havas News Agency: The Finnish war report stated that Soviet troops launched repeated attacks on the northern route yesterday, but they were all repelled by the German-Finnish joint forces. There was only artillery fire and reconnaissance activity on the Karelian Isthmus front.

### Germany and Belarus in Negotiations

Geneva, Switzerland, April 30, Havas News Agency: The National Daily recently published that the German government has studied the possibility of establishing a "Belarusian government" in the occupied areas of the Soviet Union. According to well-informed sources in Berlin, this kind of government will exercise greater power over the people than the German commissioners currently enjoy. The establishment of such a government can give ordinary civilians infinite hope and constitute an important proof of Germany's anti-Bolshevik struggle. Moreover, this move will also have a major impact on the Slavic peoples of Southeastern Europe. For example, Bulgaria's position will be completely changed. The German government has conducted negotiations with several "Belarusian" dignitaries. However, whether they will accept Germany's suggestions and whether they can have sufficient power is still difficult to say at this time. It is only known that no agreement has been reached so far.

### German Military Communique

German Führer's Headquarters, 1st Day of Sea Communication News Agency: The German military communique this afternoon stated that our army is making progress in its offensive in Eastern Europe. The enemy's attempts to pressure the German defense line under the cover of tanks have failed. The German-Finnish joint forces in Lapland and Murmansk repelled the enemy's repeated attempts to attack. Our bombers attacked targets in Sevastopol, Novorossiysk, and Leningrad at night, dropping bombs and incendiary bombs, and returned with success. As a result of yesterday's air battles, 53 Soviet aircraft were shot down, and another three were destroyed on the ground. In North Africa, the German-Italian joint forces repelled the British army's night attack and captured many enemy soldiers. The airfield on Malta Island was bombed at night, resulting in heavy losses. Last night, a group of German bombers attacked port facilities in eastern England. Air Force Lieutenant Luke flew far for reconnaissance, showing extraordinary courage and obtaining valuable information before returning.

### Europe

US Naval Commander Stark Arrives in England
Vennant Returns to His Post on the Same Plane

US Warships to Cruise the Mediterranean and Indian Oceans

London, 1st Day, Reuters News Agency: The US Ambassador to Britain, Vennant, has returned to his post after being home for a long time for consultations. Today, the US Naval Commander for Europe, Admiral Stark, arrived at a British port by plane and will come here to take office. The British Chief of Naval Staff, Admiral Pound, welcomed Admiral Stark at a certain port.

London, April 30, Havas News Agency: It has been officially announced that the former US Chief of Naval Staff, Admiral Stark, arrived here by plane this morning, preparing to take up the new position of Commander of the US Fleet in European waters.

Stockholm, Sweden, 1st Day of Sea Communication News Agency: According to news received here, the mission of US Naval Commander for European Waters Stark's arrival in London is said to be to conduct negotiations with British officials to discuss the possibility of the Allies launching an offensive.

Stockholm, Sweden, 1st Day of Sea Communication News Agency: According to a London dispatch received here today, the naval expert of the Daily Mail reported that President Roosevelt has decided to send the two battleships "Washington No. 1 and North Carolina," several cruisers, and other fleets to assist the British fleet in the Mediterranean and Indian Oceans. The cruising of the US fleet in these two oceans has major political implications.

### Question of Opening a Second Battlefield

Berlin, 1st Day of Sea Communication News Agency: German Propaganda Minister Dr. Goebbels published an article in the Völkischer Beobachter, stating, "The British and American sides have declared that the second battlefield has been opened on the Western Front. We can assure Britain that the German army does not need to transfer one million troops from the Eastern Front to the Western Front. The Western Front defense army has sufficient troops to repel the British attack. The British attempt to attack will suffer heavy losses. The British and American sides have spread news of chaos in the Soviet Union. However, Germany does not hope for the internal collapse of the Soviet Union. The national defense mechanism of a country will inevitably be severely weakened after important industrial centers and fertile agricultural areas are occupied. It is not surprising that the Soviet Union urgently demands assistance from Britain. The British attack is not a serious military action. A few soldiers land in the dark of night and flee a few minutes later, which is ridiculous. The British military authorities also know this. The British attack is clearly a propaganda action rather than a military action. The British offensive seems difficult to satisfy the Soviet Union under heavy pressure."

Stockholm, Sweden, 1st Day of Sea Communication News Agency: British Dominion Minister Major Attlee formally refuted the request for the establishment of a second front proposed by Lord Beaverbrook, who is currently in the United States, on behalf of Prime Minister Churchill in the House of Commons yesterday, stating that he is currently not a government official and is only on an informal mission in the United States. However, the British government cannot prohibit him from speaking. Attlee's statement caused considerable surprise from all parties, because he was originally on an important mission when he went to the United States.

London, April 30, Havas News Agency: The Labour Party's newspaper, the Daily Herald, published an editorial today, strongly advocating that opening a second battlefield must be handled with caution. "The people of the country all want to see the plan to open a second battlefield become a reality, but they hope that it will not be done rashly, nor will it lead to the unnecessary sacrifice of soldiers and armaments. The people of the country are prepared to endure all necessary dangers, but only after confirming that there will be no unnecessary sacrifices can they act. The reason why we are currently stopping our activities is probably due to the lack of sufficient equipment. We must wait until this situation changes before we can do something."

### US and Soviet Officials in Talks

Kuybyshev, April 30, Reuters News Agency: US Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Steinhardt's conversation with Soviet leaders took place today in Molotov's office.

### Telephone Tax

Limited to Public Concession
Specific Collection Methods Still Under Discussion
Annual Tax Revenue Could Reach Over 3 Million

The Municipal Council recently issued a notice to collect telephone taxes starting this month. As this matter has a wide range of implications, this reporter visited the current highest-ranking person in charge of the Shanghai Telephone Company. According to him, the company has not yet received instructions from its superiors regarding this matter, and the Municipal Council's decision was only made within the last day or two. Only an oral notification was given yesterday, and no specific implementation methods were mentioned. Therefore, when and how the telephone tax will be collected is still subject to deliberation and agreement among the relevant parties.

According to the person in charge, the telephone tax will be borne directly by telephone users, and its scope is obviously limited to the Public Concession. Although the collection method has not yet been decided, it will likely be similar to the collection of entertainment tax, with the taxable amount added to the monthly telephone bill, which will be paid by users to the telephone company on a regular basis and transferred to the Municipal Council. This adds an extra layer of trouble for the company, but it is more convenient for users. When asked when the detailed rules for implementation will be decided, the person in charge replied that he did not know.

### Telephone Bills Still Paid in Old Currency

Recently, there have been rumors that the Shanghai Telephone Company will use Japanese military scrip to collect telephone fees, which has attracted a lot of attention. The reporter asked the person in charge whether this was true. He said that the company was completely unaware of this matter, and the company's superiors had not made any similar decision. Currently, telephone bills are still calculated in legal tender. When asked whether new currency will be used, the person in charge replied that the company had no such plans, but in his personal opinion, it was possible.

### Telephone Tax is a Substantial Amount

The telephone tax will be collected at 5 yuan per month for residential telephones, 2 yuan per month for extensions, 10 yuan per month for business telephones, and 4 yuan per month for extensions. The tax for new telephone installations is 50 yuan per unit, and the transfer tax is 20 yuan per unit. Currently, there are approximately 40,000 telephones in the Public Concession. On average

Berlin, 1st (Reuters) – After the Salzburg meeting, Mussolini sent a telegram to Hitler, stating, "At this critical historical juncture, the opportunity to exchange views on military and political issues of such far-reaching impact is particularly welcome. I am particularly satisfied that we have fully agreed on all the issues studied in this meeting. This is another sign that our weapons will surely win victory."

Rome, 1st (Haitong News Agency) – Italian journalist Gayda published an article in "Italian News" yesterday, stating that the political development of the Axis powers and the signatories of the Tripartite Pact increasingly proves that this trend is becoming more stable. There are two key points in the European war situation: the Soviet front and the Mediterranean. Italy will continue to send large forces to the Eastern Front to fight, and Germany will continue to operate in the Mediterranean. Germany and Italy will jointly advance the European war situation.

Rome, April 30 (Havas) – The Italian Daily reports that the authorities of the Axis powers are currently engaged in important negotiations, which will clearly lead to major decisions, as the war has entered a new phase, and all new plans and decisions must be properly determined. The main goal of the negotiations currently underway between the Axis powers and their allies is to unify the various battlefields into one large battlefield, so that the actions of all countries are synchronized. Currently, the operational efforts on the Eastern Front and the Mediterranean front have been effectively adjusted. The offensive on the Eastern Front is about to begin, and Italy will send more troops to the Eastern Front to participate in the fighting. Germany will send more troops and armaments to the Mediterranean theater.

Madrid, April 30 (Havas) – Reports indicate that shocking news will be transmitted from Berlin tomorrow. For example, the Berlin correspondent of "Arriba" cabled, "Astonishing rumors have been rampant for days, and have become increasingly powerful. Although I dare to assert that the publication of this news will be well received, we all know that in this difficult period, professional ambition must be put aside. Therefore, it is not convenient to publish it here. All I can say today is to warn you to pay attention to tomorrow's news." The Madrid Daily also reported, "Earlier this week, German Führer Hitler gave a shocking speech. By the end of this week, the German side will issue an even more shocking communiqué regarding the current European war. Rumors have been rampant in Germany and abroad in recent days, all claiming that shocking events will occur within a few days. However, the Axis powers have maintained their usual silence. All we can assert at this time is that the so-called shocking news has no direct relationship with the offensive on the Eastern Front, because the date of the German army's offensive in the east is approaching, and Berlin's attention is currently focused on the Eastern Front."

Washington, April 30 (Havas) – The two US Secretaries of State recently made a statement to the press, stating, "According to news from London, Germany has explored with the British government the possibility of signing an armistice agreement, or even a final peace treaty, but I cannot confirm this statement."

Berlin, 1st (Haitong News Agency) – British propaganda claims that internal difficulties have occurred in Italy, attempting to negotiate peace alone, etc. German newspapers regard this as a sign of British weakness. The newspapers strongly emphasize that Germany and Italy are closely united and unshakable. Britain has repeatedly been defeated in battle, and Churchill has no choice but to fabricate rumors to maintain appearances.
