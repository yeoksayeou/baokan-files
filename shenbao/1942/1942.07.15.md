### Main Battles Taking Place Between the Don and Volga Rivers; Soviets Admit General Situation Still Critical, Fighting in the Kalinin Region Also Tense

German Leader's Headquarters, 14th, Havas News Agency Telegram: This afternoon's German war report stated that German forces on the southern front of Eastern Europe are launching a major offensive, the battlefield is expanding southward, and several points of the Soviet army's heavily defended positions have been breached. Our tank forces are advancing rapidly northwest of Voronezh. Several Soviet attempts to attack in the central sector have been repelled. During the mopping-up of the remaining enemy forces in Voroshilov, we discovered the hiding place of Soviet Second Army Commander Vlasov.

Moscow, 14th, Allied News Agency Telegram: It is reported that more German troops have crossed the Don River near the bridgehead at Voronezh. German tanks and motorized infantry are still moving continuously from Kursk to the west bank of the Don.

Stockholm, Sweden, 14th, Havas News Agency Telegram: The Red Army General Headquarters has just issued a communiqué stating that the German side has concentrated large numbers of infantry and tanks in a narrow area on the front line and has broken through our army's positions, reaching the city of Voronezh. Our army is still fighting bravely. Large-scale tank battles are currently taking place everywhere on the front line. Our army is also resolutely resisting in the Boguchar district. The German side also dispatched paratroopers to land near Kalinin, but they have been defeated by our army. Some of them were shot down before they could land. At the same time, the Soviet radio station also broadcast news stating that the German Fourth Panzer Army is attempting to launch a large-scale offensive in the Voronezh area. The Red Army is resolutely resisting. The German side has concentrated a large army near the city, and its Third Motorized Army arrived at the front line yesterday. The German army is attempting to expand its bridgehead on the Don River in order to pour all its forces onto the east bank of the river. The German army also erected a pontoon bridge yesterday, but it was immediately destroyed by Red Army aircraft. According to the "Pravda" newspaper, the fighting on the front line of Kalinin City has become increasingly fierce in recent days, but the front line has been shortened, and the fighting is only taking place near the highway. The Red Army launched a counterattack at night and occupied several strongholds along the road, but the German army is constantly counterattacking, and the fighting is extremely fierce. In some places, corpses are piled up like mountains, numbering in the thousands.

Bern, Switzerland, 14th, Allied News Agency Telegram: The main battle on the Eastern Front is now being fought between the Don and Volga rivers. The German army is attacking in three directions, aiming to converge on Stalingrad. The Fourth Panzer Army is forcibly crossing the Don River and advancing towards Voronezh, while several motorized divisions are attacking Boguchar. It is reported that the third route army has crossed Lisichansk. The Don and Volga rivers are 350 miles apart, and Stalingrad is a tank manufacturing area.

Moscow, 13th, Havas News Agency Telegram: The "Pravda" newspaper recently reported, "The situation on the southern front of the Eastern Front is still very tense. In the Kalinin region, the German side has transferred a large number of reserve troops to the front line to fight, but the Red Army, despite being outnumbered, is still resisting. As a result of our army's counterattack yesterday morning, we have recaptured several villages and towns. In the Rostov region, fierce fighting took place all day yesterday. The enemy army repeatedly attempted to expand the bridgehead on the Don River. Their Fourth Panzer Division and motorized troops are concentrating on the left bank of the Don. Yesterday afternoon, the Hungarian Sixth and Seventh Divisions also attempted to cross the river but were repelled by our artillery, leaving 400 corpses behind. In addition, according to news from other war zones, although our country's tanks, aircraft, and infantry are resisting strongly, the general situation is still extremely serious."

German Forces Divide Into Three Routes To Attack Stalingrad

Bern, 14th, Allied News Agency Telegram: Judging from various reports received here, the entire southern Soviet front is now under threat. The German vanguard, advancing from the Taganrog region, has reached 40 miles west of Rostov (the road to the Caucasus). The German forces, entering the steppe from the Black Earth Region in the north, are also rapidly moving south, attacking Stalingrad, an important tank manufacturing city in the Volga Bend. It is rumored that the German forces, led by Bock, advancing on Stalingrad, have crossed Kechesk and reached the outskirts of Mikhulinskaya (approximately 125 miles west of the Don River bend). One report states that the situation in the Rostov front on the Azov is quite serious for the Soviets. German forces, cutting the Moscow-Rostov railway for 60 miles near Russoch, are now threatening the southern section of this railway line and will also cut it off. It is also reported that German forces are tightening their encirclement of the important industrial city of Voroshilovgrad from the northwest and northeast. The fall of this city is imminent. Currently, the main forces of the German and Red armies are fiercely fighting in the Don River bend. The outcome of the fierce battle between the Don and Volga rivers is expected to not only determine the fate of Stalingrad but also affect the entire southern front. It is reported that German forces are now dividing into three routes to advance on Stalingrad, with the second major force, composed of motorized divisions, fiercely striking in the Boguchar area, and the third German force having crossed Lisichansk and advancing forward. Reports from various sources indicate that Allied and neutral military experts generally believe that Soviet General Timoshenko will now defend the east bank of the Don River to prevent the German forces from continuing their advance, but it is feared that he will not be able to hold out for long.

Somewhere on the Ukrainian Border, 13th, Havas News Agency Telegram: The Red Army in the Don River basin is continuing to retreat. This situation is not only due to the German army's superior strength but also because the Red Army cannot utilize the railways in the area. The Voronezh-Rostov railway line is still in the hands of the Red Army, but because several sections of the track have been cut by the German-Hungarian allied forces, it can no longer be used for troop transport. A German motorized unit in the Belovodsk district occupied the city yesterday and crossed the railway eastward. The German army is now enjoying the convenience of the Central and Eastern European railway network. The Red Army has lost areas with dense railway networks, and future Red Army transportation will be greatly inconvenienced. The Soviet motorized forces are now dividing into three routes to advance on Stalingrad. The first route is advancing rapidly along both banks of the Don River and has crossed Mikhurinsk and reached the vicinity of the Shapin River's confluence with the Don River. The second route is advancing along the Donets River, reaching almost to Voroshilovgrad. The third route is advancing east of Millerovo. In addition, the German army is launching an offensive in the Taganrog area to coordinate with the German forces in the Don and Donets River basins and may later turn north and launch a general attack on Stalino.

Fierce Bayonet Fighting Between German and Soviet Armies on the Southern Front

Berlin, 14th, Havas News Agency Telegram: The German High Command announced last night that German and allied forces are pursuing the defeated enemy on the southern front of the Eastern Front and broke through the Soviet army's ranks on the 12th of this month, capturing many enemy soldiers and various munitions. Mechanized units, leading the infantry, are rushing forward, cutting off the Soviet retreat route. Fierce bayonet fighting occurred that day, lasting for a full day. The enemy army was finally defeated by our army. The German army then crossed the river and established a bridgehead. German air fleets bombed enemy artillery positions and supply units east of the Don River with considerable success. The Soviet army launched fierce counterattacks north and northwest of Voronezh, but as a result, they were heavily damaged and repelled by our army. On that day, the enemy lost 111 armored vehicles. German aircraft raided a Soviet airfield, destroying four enemy aircraft. The day before yesterday, German aircraft shot down a total of 47 enemy aircraft on the southern front.

Berlin, 14th, Havas News Agency Telegram: German dive bomber and fighter squadrons continue to bomb enemy concentration areas in southern Eastern Europe. The Soviet army is heavily concentrated in the Rostov area, with many tanks and motorcycles, making it the main target of the German air force. More than 50 Soviet heavy vehicles were destroyed, and several heavy tanks were also destroyed. At the same time, Soviet aircraft made low-level attacks on enemy railways. Soviet aircraft took off to intercept, and six were shot down. German bomber squadrons in the central sector also attacked Soviet railways and transportation vehicles. Other Soviet aircraft dispersed Soviet troops who were gathering and assisted the army in repelling the attacking Soviet troops. The Soviet army suffered heavy losses in manpower and material resources. In this area, five Soviet aircraft were shot down.

Berlin, 14th, Havas News Agency Telegram: Officials here announced that the rumors circulating outside that the Soviet army's offensive in the Orel region had broken into the city of Orel are purely unfounded rumors. The positions deployed by the German army in the Orel region have not been breached in any way. Several Soviet attacks have been repelled by our army with heavy losses. The Soviet army has made no progress whatsoever.

Berlin, 14th, Havas News Agency Telegram: Military officials here commented on the situation on the southern front of the Eastern Front last night, saying that General Timoshenko's army is approaching a dead end and that the military impact will be evident within days. German forces are pursuing the enemy army along the entire line and have now reached the steppe region. German aircraft continue to bomb the retreating Soviet army, while German mechanized units are using flanking maneuvers to create a huge pocket around the Soviet army. The Soviet army's situation is very chaotic. The Soviet commander can no longer control his subordinates. Regarding the fighting around Rzhev, German military officials said that there is only fighting to clear out the remaining enemy forces there.

The War Will Reach a Decisive Stage in a Few Weeks

Stockholm, Sweden, 13th, Havas News Agency Telegram: The most significant development on the Eastern Front yesterday was the Red Army's retreat from the two cities of Kantemirovka and Lisichansk southeast of Kharkov, which has been acknowledged by the Moscow government. According to the war reports issued by the Soviet Union, the Red Army's position in the Voronezh area is becoming increasingly serious. General Timoshenko's forces in the area between the Don and Donets rivers are continuing to move south. The industrial center of Voroshilovgrad in the Donets River basin is also directly threatened from the northwest and northeast. The Soviet side claims that the Red Army was forced to retreat because the German army's manpower is far greater than that of the Red Army. General Timoshenko's forces had to retreat voluntarily to avoid being surrounded. The German forces concentrated in the Voronezh area include four infantry corps, two or three panzer divisions, and 700 aircraft. There are also six or seven Soviet corps between Kupiansk and the Don River, with the panzer divisions of General Kleist assisting in the operation. In addition, there are three other German corps stationed between the Don River and the Black Sea. Therefore, the Soviet army that General Timoshenko is facing totals no less than 50 infantry divisions, 10 to 12 armored divisions, and 3,000 to 4,000 aircraft. For example, in certain areas, the German army had only 50 to 60 aircraft before launching an offensive, but by this time, it had gradually increased to 500 to 600 aircraft. Currently, the main force of the German army is continuing to advance between the Don River and the Donets River, forcing the Red Army to withdraw from the two cities of Kantemirovka and Lisichansk. Generally, the Red Army has abandoned the three cities of Starobilsk, Millerovo, and Gassansk, as the German offensive obviously puts the defenders of Rostov and the lower Don River in a difficult situation. However, the Red Army is launching large-scale counterattacks north of Voronezh and in the Orel region, but unfortunately, it is still difficult to stop the German side from implementing its operational plan. Recent Soviet war reports have not mentioned the Red Army's counterattacks, which is also noteworthy. German military officials have expressed great optimism about the future of the war, believing that the war on the Eastern Front can be resolved within this year. Since last winter, this is the first time that Soviet military officials have made such a statement. For example, the "Frankfurter Zeitung" published an editorial stating, "The German army's offensive on the Eastern Front has fully demonstrated Germany's military strength in the first one or two weeks. The progress made by the German army is greater than the enemy expected and has actually exceeded our expectations. Judging by what we can expect, the fate of the war can be said to have been decided at this moment. Everyone knows that in the coming weeks, the war will reach its final decisive stage. At that time, the Soviet Union can fully focus on dealing with Western Europe. However, the German General Staff must prepare everything to continue fighting in the Soviet Union next winter."

### Tank Battles Occur Southwest and North of El Alamein; Stalemate Between the Two Armies So Far, British Fleet Once Attacks Marsa Matruh

Bern, Switzerland, 14th, Allied News Agency Telegram: Tank battles occurred again yesterday southwest and north of El Alamein, Egypt. As of now, the two armies remain in a stalemate. The German army is on the offensive north of El Alamein, and although the British army has launched several attacks, the German army has been able to firmly defend its newly acquired positions. On the southwest front, the British army is on the offensive. The British Eighth Army is using a large number of tanks to cover the infantry's advance, and the German side is also deploying tank forces to counterattack, resulting in a major battle.

Cairo, 14th, Havas News Agency Telegram: The British Middle East Command announced that on the northern section of the Egyptian front, our army repelled the enemy's infantry and tank offensive. On the southern section of the front, our army attacked the enemy's positions. Our fighter-bombers attacked enemy airfields and tank concentrations in the El Adaba area, destroying several tanks and many other vehicles.

Lisbon, 14th, Allied News Agency Telegram: According to news from Cairo, German tanks and trucks carrying infantry in North Africa strongly attacked British army positions in the northern sector of the El Alamein line last night. It is reported that the German army was transferred from the central front to the northern sector to attack the Tel el Eisa station. The artillery of both sides exchanged heavy fire. The battle is ongoing.

Stockholm, Sweden, 14th, Havas News Agency Telegram: The "Nordische Beobachter" newspaper published a report from a London correspondent stating that no particularly important events have occurred on the Egyptian border. It is reported that General Auchinleck's plan is to keep the Axis forces busy day and night so that they will be exhausted. The British Air Force is constantly active, and the British Mediterranean Fleet once attacked Marsa Matruh.

Stockholm, Sweden, 14th, Havas News Agency Telegram: According to news from Durban, 4,000 British expatriates evacuated from Egypt will arrive in Natal within days.

### Soviet Union Urges Opening of Second Battlefield

Somewhere on the Soviet Border, 13th, Havas News Agency Telegram: According to Soviet sources here, the Soviet Union has been hoping for the opening of a second battlefield in Europe for some time. Since the German army launched its general offensive, putting the Soviet Union in a difficult situation, this desire must be even more urgent. This is because this fact is an indispensable condition for the Allied victory. Most Soviet political commentators believe that a second battlefield will be opened sooner or later, but they wonder whether it will be too late when the Allies decide to act.

Stockholm, Sweden, 14th, Havas News Agency Telegram: According to a London dispatch, the call for Britain to open a second front is becoming increasingly loud. All newspapers are urging Britain to launch it immediately to avoid being too late. The British government's attitude is more taciturn. British military officials point out that unless the situation in Egypt has improved, Britain cannot open another second front in Europe.

Stockholm, Sweden, 14th, Havas News Agency Telegram: Neutral sources here stated yesterday that Soviet Ambassador to Britain Maisky, representing Stalin, again asked Churchill to immediately open a second front. Since Sunday, official Soviet sources in Moscow have repeatedly told British and American journalists that unless Britain and the United States immediately launch a massive offensive in Europe, the Soviet Union may face the worst possible situation. Soviet propagandist Ehrenburg said in a radio speech, "We have been fighting alone until now. Now, some observers are still comparing the Don River battle with the Egyptian battle, which shows a lack of judgment. The German commander in the Voronezh area has about five times as many tanks as General Rommel." After openly criticizing Britain's attitude, the Soviet Union again hinted to British journalists about the need to establish a second front. As a result, the Reuters correspondent in Moscow telegraphed London, strongly arguing that the Soviet Union needs Britain and the United States to launch a counter-offensive against Germany. The war report from Moscow to London last night was extremely pessimistic. Soviet censors have not retained any of these reports, which shows that the situation is indeed quite serious. It is hoped that Britain and the United States can have an answer in action. Reuters correspondent Kim Harrow telegraphed that the Soviet army's successful offensive, approaching Stalingrad, has seriously threatened the Soviet Union's three major lifelines, namely the oil of the Caucasus, the coal and iron of the Donets region, and the grain of the black soil belt south of the Don River. The British Exchange Telegraph Company reported from the front line that the Soviet army's position in the Voronezh area is becoming increasingly critical. Large German tank forces are advancing towards both banks of the Don River. German forces have crossed the Don River in three places, one north of Voronezh and the other south of the city. The tank battle on the east bank of the Don River is intensifying. German forces have established three strong bridgeheads there. The railway from Rostov to Moscow has been cut in three places. Timoshenko's supply is experiencing extreme difficulties. Now, Moscow still does not know what the German army's goal is. There are two possibilities generally speculated: one is that after occupying Stalingrad, the German army can encircle Rostov and the powerful Soviet army in the area; the other possibility is that the German army will suddenly turn north from Voronezh and directly attack Moscow. The military correspondent of Reuters in London is also deeply afraid that the German army may occupy Stalingrad. General Timoshenko may have to withdraw his troops from the Taganrog area to avoid being surrounded.

### Nineteen Nationalist Party Members in Egypt Expelled; Britain Denies Threatening Egyptian King

Cairo, 13th, Havas News Agency Telegram: Nineteen members of the Nationalist Party recently issued a declaration strongly opposing the current government's pro-British policy. The leader of the Nationalist Party, who is now the prime minister of the current cabinet, Nahas, recently ordered the expulsion of these nineteen people from the party. According to the party's secretary-general, Makram Ebeid, was recently expelled from the party, and the party's executive committee resolved some time ago to crack down on all reactionary elements within the party during the current "emergency period."

London, 13th, Havas News Agency Telegram: The rumors that British Ambassador to Egypt Lampson and British military commander in Egypt General Stone threatened Egyptian King Farouk and that British troops surrounded the Egyptian palace have been denied by Reuters as unfounded rumors. It is only said that "British authorities acknowledge that when the threat to Egypt became increasingly serious, British Ambassador to Egypt Sir Miles Lampson and British military commander in Egypt General Stone jointly went to the palace to meet with King Farouk. The outcome of the meeting was very satisfactory to both sides."

Berlin, 13th, Havas News Agency Telegram: German semi-official sources recently issued a statement to foreign journalists stating, "Regarding the events that have recently occurred in Egypt, the German Foreign Ministry cannot decide on a position at this time. It is rumored that the British military authorities in Egypt have exerted great pressure on Egyptian King Farouk, forcing him to declare war on the Axis powers. This matter is very serious, but we have not received reliable information here." Rome, 14th, Havas News Agency Telegram: "Il Popolo d'Italia" reported that the chairman of the British military delegation in Cairo, Clutterbuck, is now holding meetings with the chief of staff of the Egyptian army, Atella, in the hope of persuading Egypt to formally participate in the war. The meeting is being held in the Egyptian Ministry of Defense. During the meeting, Clutterbuck reported on the military situation to Atella and requested that Egypt participate in the war. Atella refused and stated the difficulties in implementing this plan. Clutterbuck then made threatening remarks, saying that if Egypt does not change its attitude, the British military authorities will carry out sabotage.

### The Situation in India is Becoming Increasingly Difficult

Stockholm, Sweden, 14th, Havas News Agency Telegram: Since the Indian National Congress Working Committee decided to oppose the British authorities' defense measures, the situation in India has become increasingly difficult. According to the "Göteborgs Handels- och Sjöfartstidning" London dispatch, the situation in India has reached "the point of explosion." The Indian National Congress, after several hours of discussion, resolved that the appeal to boycott British measures was drafted by Gandhi. The British side considers this to be an open challenge to Britain. Gandhi's influence is growing, but the British authorities still do not dare to arrest him, because the British side does not want to regard Gandhi as a traitor, and Gandhi himself and the Indian National Congress are welcoming this step. However, the British authorities are now taking various harsh measures to suppress the opposition of the Indians, so India will once again be shrouded in an atmosphere of darkness in the near future.

Zurich, 14th, Havas News Agency Telegram: Newspapers here published a dispatch from a London reporter stating that the Indian government has now announced its decision to strengthen India's war potential and will rapidly develop transportation and various industries.

### Murmansk of the Soviet Union: A Seaport Within the Arctic Circle

Although the Soviet Union's area is the largest in Europe, almost all of its foreign transportation routes are under the threat of neighboring countries, which puts it in an extremely unfavorable position in this Soviet-German war. Before the war, Leningrad was one of the Soviet Union's largest distribution centers for goods. All goods imported from overseas mostly passed through Leningrad and were then transported to various parts of the Soviet Union along extensive railway lines. Goods from all parts of the Soviet Union were also mostly gathered in Leningrad before being exported overseas. Since the outbreak of the Soviet-German war, Germany, together with Finland, has blockaded the Gulf of Finland, which leads to Leningrad, and Leningrad itself has been besieged by German forces for ten months now. The Soviet Union's inability to continue using the port is an obvious fact. Secondly, there are the ports along the Black Sea, which is the quickest route to the Mediterranean and the only sea access to the Near East. However, with the Crimean Peninsula now under German control, the Black Sea is no longer a safe outlet. As for the Soviet Union's Asian seaport, Vladivostok, although it is the closest seaport to the United States, the Soviet Union seems unwilling to rely heavily on it. Moreover, goods imported from here must travel across approximately five thousand miles on the Siberian Railway to reach Moscow, which is both slow and uneconomical, and definitely not an ideal transportation route during wartime.

With Leningrad to the east, Vladivostok to the west, and the Black Sea to the south effectively blocked, the Soviet Union is, in fact, under a three-sided blockade. However, to the north, it has a continuous coastline that is not easily attacked by the enemy. Its only drawback is that it is frozen for most of the year. Navigation is possible along the coast for only three months of the year (or longer, depending on the climate cycle). However, amidst all these unfavorable conditions, the port of Murmansk suddenly appeared at the top of the Kola Peninsula. Although it is located within the Arctic Circle, the port of Murmansk remains ice-free year-round. However, this does not mean that there is no trace of ice here at all, but rather that even if it freezes, it does not hinder winter navigation at all. From the tip of the Kola Peninsula, ships can reach the Atlantic Ocean without passing through the Gulf of Finland, the straits between Germany and Denmark, and the English Channel. In the summer, sailing east from here can reach the Pacific Ocean via almost half the distance of the Panama Canal or the Red Sea. As for connections with various parts of the country, Murmansk has a railway line to Leningrad, as well as the recently completed Baltic-White Sea Canal.

Currently, Soviet ships or American ships, fully loaded with war supplies from the west coast of the United States, sail north, pass through the Bering Strait, and go directly to the year-round ice-free port of Murmansk. The Bering Strait and the area to its south can be easily controlled by a small number of Soviet troops. As for the voyage north, it relies entirely on the continuous assistance and instructions of Soviet radio stations, the guidance of reconnaissance aircraft pointing out routes between ice floes in the air, and the icebreaking work of icebreakers in frozen areas. British ships, fully loaded with aid for the Soviet Union, also pass through the Arctic Ocean from northern Scotland under the same conditions and arrive at Murmansk. On such a heavily burdened sea, even if it is not completely impossible to cut off this route, it is fraught with thorns.

The military supplies from the United States and Britain that are delivered to Murmansk are then transferred by rail to various parts of the Soviet Union to supply the Red Army in combat. The fact that British and American armaments can now flow into the Soviet Union in a steady stream is entirely due to the maintenance of this route. Therefore, Murmansk has become the lifeline of the Soviet Union today.

Since Murmansk occupies such an important position for the Soviet Union, the Soviet Union had already begun actively developing the port before the outbreak of this European war. Huge naval factories have already been completed, indicating that the Soviet Union was already prepared to use this port as a base for its European fleet.

The naturally dangerous terrain makes Murmansk a key port that is easy to defend and difficult to attack. No ship can enter Murmansk unless it is within 30 miles of the open sea. At the same time, the waterway into Murmansk's Kola Bay is very narrow. A British officer who once visited this place wrote: "This bay is extremely narrow. From any place on both banks, it is possible to be subjected to dense fire. Therefore, Murmansk is not only an important transportation port, but also a strategically impeccable key point."

### Subletter Subleases Houses: Rent Distribution Methods; Municipal Council Explains in Detail, Investigates and Severely Punishes Violations of Regulations

The Public Information Office of the Municipal Council announced that, according to recent investigations, some subletters are still inattentive to the Municipal Council's subleasing regulations, and these subletters are inevitably at risk of being severely fined or sentenced. Therefore, the following is a summary and explanation of the regulations promulgated in the Municipal Council's Announcement No. 5991:

Subleasing Houses Requires a License

Regardless of who it is, even if subleasing one room, a subleasing license must be obtained. As for subletters who, before June 30 of this year, held Western-style boarding house or private hotel licenses, or who have applied for such licenses and hold temporary receipts for the application, they must also apply for a subleasing license. This is because the Municipal Council has now promulgated new rules for Western-style boarding houses, so most of the previously obtained licenses cannot be renewed. Currently, they should immediately change to the newly implemented subleasing license without further delay.

Fairly Distribute Rent in Accordance with Regulations

The licensee of a subleasing license must comply with the following regulations: First, the licensee should hang the license number plate on the front door. Second, they should fairly calculate the rent of the house, the method of calculation should be based on their various expenses, plus a legal profit of 20%, and then distribute the rent among the subtenants according to the size and location of the rooms occupied by each subtenant. This provision is the most important. As for the method of calculating the rent, it can be obtained from the table below. When the subletter obtains the license, the Municipal Council will issue a form. This form should be carefully filled out and hung in a prominent place in the house, preferably inside the front door or on the stairs.

Rent Calculation Should Be Proportional

The total rent, including everything, must be totaled. Only the following five items are allowed to be included in the rent: Rent paid to the landlord (if the subletter is the landlord, then fill in the Municipal Council's rent valuation), Municipal Council's property tax, subleasing license fee (3 yuan or 8 yuan per month), tap water fee, electricity fee. Only a profit of 20% is allowed on the total of the above items. No other items may be added. For example, rent paid: 100 yuan; property tax: 50 yuan; license fee: 3 yuan; tap water fee: 14 yuan; electricity fee: 33 yuan; total: 200 yuan; profit of 20%: 40 yuan. The total rent including everything is 240 yuan.

Calculate Rent According to Area

Then, the area of each room in the house should be calculated in square feet (excluding the area reserved for public use), and the percentage of the total area that it occupies should be noted separately as follows. Each subtenant should pay rent equal to the percentage of the total area they occupy, including everything. The above-mentioned rent including everything may change monthly, so the subleased rent may also change accordingly. According to the previous table, the rent payable by each person is as follows:

Severe Punishment for Overcharging on Top Floors

Regarding the subletter's transfer of lease rights (i.e., transferring the house at a premium), a warning should be given, that is, this matter violates the Municipal Council's regulations prohibiting the solicitation of premiums. The office enforcing the subleasing license regulations of the Municipal Council will investigate all matters of solicitation of premiums once discovered. If the investigation is true, the person who violates the regulations prohibiting the solicitation of premiums will be severely punished. Recently, there have been several cases of imprisonment in court for soliciting premiums. In one case, the defendant was sentenced to three months' imprisonment.

Apartments and Hotels Are Not Under Jurisdiction

Rental disputes between the owners of Western-style boarding houses or private hotels and their tenants are not within the scope of the Municipal Council's subleasing enforcement office. Each qualified Western-style boarding house or private hotel must provide the following: room facilities, accommodation supply, and food supply. If the above three items cannot be provided, the lodging house should immediately apply for a subleasing license and comply with the license regulations. The subleasing enforcement office is only authorized to deal with cases related to subleasing license regulations, and other cases cannot be accepted. Furthermore, the office has no right to force subtenants to pay rent or order them to move out, but it also does not prevent subletters from asking their subtenants to move out.

### Citizens Receive Rice in Good Order; Shantytowns Begin Receiving Certificates

After the sale of the second phase of household rice in the two concessions began on the 13th with the second rice purchase certificate, since there are six days in total and one day can represent multiple people purchasing, there has been no crowding at the rice shops. The order has been very good. According to reporters, the rice shops in the two concessions have decided to collect the payment slips from the Rice and Grain Office today, pay for and collect the third phase of household rice. The quantity should be clear today. It is generally believed that the quantity purchased with each rice purchase certificate will not differ from the second phase. Also, the Rice and Grain Management Committee has notified the rice purchase certificate offices in each district to continue handling the reissuance of rice purchase certificates to households that have not received them. Complaints can be made at any time and there is no deadline. The issuance of rice purchase certificates to shantytowns has also begun, so that every resident in the two concessions can universally receive rice purchase certificates.

### More Than Three Thousand British Overseas Chinese Waiting for Evacuation by Ship

The English-language "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury" reports that, according to news this morning (the 14th), there are more than 8,000 British overseas Chinese in Shanghai, of whom approximately 3,280 have registered to await evacuation by ship, less than half of the total.

### Government Bonds Have Spot Goods Flowing Out

As expected, the over-the-counter market for government bonds fell by more than one yuan yesterday, with spot goods flowing out. A tall tree catches the wind, which is inevitable. Although it has nothing to do with the bonds themselves, if this outlet is not blocked, it will not easily attract the attention of large investors at a time when rumors are rife. Judging from yesterday's market, most of the buyers were still retail investors. Tongshun slightly replenished its holdings, and Xinyuan, Xinfeng, Lianhe, and Hu Heji made some purchases, but Tongli sold more than one million, and the rest were not counted. The trend has not yet been established. As a result, there was a uniform decline of 50 cents to 1.5 yuan. The turnover was approximately 2 million yuan. A brief table is listed below:

Category Highest Lowest Closing Compared to Previous Day

Unified A 39.50 38.00 38.40 Down 1.30
Unified B 37.50 36.00 36.40 Down 1.30
Unified C 37.60 36.80 36.90 Down 1.00
Unified D 34.50 33.80 34.00 Down 0.50
Unified E 35.70 34.40 34.00 Down 1.50

### Chinese Stocks Rise Unceasingly Triggering Offloading for Cash

The Chinese stock market situation yesterday turned flat and tired, as the recent steady rise has triggered the activity of buyers at high prices, offloading for cash. Cultural stocks declined more sharply, department store performance declined, new pharmaceutical stocks softened, and only textiles remained stable, as the industry's development prospects are good and there is no shortage of investors looking for bargains at limited prices. Yongxiang has news of a capital increase and is also firm. With people's minds relatively settled, the stock market situation will turn to fluctuate within a small range. The stock prices are listed separately below:

### Gold Ornaments Hang at Small 50 Yuan

Yesterday, the price of gold jewelry at Shanghai gold shops, with Da Xin and other shops quoted an initial price of 2,400 yuan per tael, but after 10:00 AM, it was lowered by a small 50 yuan, to 2,350 yuan (purchases were reduced by more than 300 yuan), which was actually due to the price-making among the industry, with the price further reduced to 2,070 to 2,080 yuan per tael, a further reduction of 40 yuan. Transactions were still clear. As for ornament silver, the price remained at 17 yuan per tael, but the price-making among the industry was only 12.5 yuan.

Yesterday, the Shanghai Money Trade Association's interbank lending rate was 1 jiao and 5 fen, and new remittance drafts were still clearing against cash.

### Raw Materials Not Cheap Cotton Cloth Returns to High Price

Factory Cloth Yesterday, the cloth market started to rebound due to continuous excessive declines. Judging from the cost of raw materials, it is difficult to go any lower. Moreover, the process of obtaining mobile licenses is faster than before, without much obstruction. Therefore, the industry slightly absorbed, and the selling prices of various cloths rebounded. Coarse and fine cloth increased by 2 to 3 yuan per bolt. 16-pound Earth coarse cloth was 187 yuan, Flying Swan 185 yuan, 12-pound Earth fine cloth 168 yuan, Da Peng 163 yuan, Fugui fine twill 145 yuan, Magnolia bleached cloth 168 yuan, Qin Meiren gray cloth 134 yuan, and Meiren fine twill 143 yuan, all had open transactions. However, the Peach Blossom Lady Lin, due to the factory's continued large-scale sales, was floating, following the market to sell. The morning market once rose to 274 yuan and 7 jiao, but in the afternoon it recovered to 272 yuan and 5 jiao, an increase of only 5 jiao.

Eastern Cloth Yesterday, the market atmosphere was stable, turning from wanting to fall to rising. 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth opened at 188 yuan for new orders, with a very small range of fluctuations, always hovering between 8 and 9 yuan. The noon closing was 188 yuan and 5 jiao. The Four Gentlemen serge was more lively in terms of ups and downs, but as soon as it entered the 3-jiao mark, buyers surged. Therefore, the opening price was 7 yuan, 2 jiao, and 7 fen, and the closing price rose to 7 yuan, 3 jiao, and 2 fen, a rebound of 7 fen compared to yesterday. Colored Ball fine cloth was 171 yuan and 2 jiao, Flying Fish 167 yuan, and Dragon Head Bank single 16 yuan and 5 jiao, approximately 2 yuan per bolt.

### Domestic Sales Continue to be Active Soybean Cake Jumps

Soybean Cake Domestic sales continued to be active, and cargo owners strengthened their intention to sell. The market continued to be strong, and the price jumped by 2 to 3 yuan. The unified market sold 1,500 pieces of Lizi cake, new goods from May, at a price of 62 to 63 yuan. Fengji cake, new goods from April, 500 pieces, at a price of 62 yuan, and another 500 pieces of new goods from May at a price of 62 yuan and 3 jiao.

Wheat Bran The supply for sale is very scarce, and the market is extremely firm. Yesterday, 200 bags of Sanxin small-packaged wheat bran, warehouse receipt from July 3rd, were sold at a price of 97 yuan.

Beans Due to the vitality of soup vendors, soybeans showed a rising trend. Red beans and yellow beans also strengthened. A total of over 100 bags of Tianjin soybeans were sold at a price of 189 yuan to 195 yuan, 150 bags of Sangyuan yellow beans at a price of 184 to 5 yuan, and 50 bags of Chongming sand red beans at a price of 170 yuan.

### Dried Sweet Potato Local Sales Proceed Smoothly

The sales of dried sweet potato are increasing smoothly, the market is quite firm, and the price has risen by 1 to 2 yuan. A total of 30 bags of Qingdao dried sweet potato were sold at a price of 119 yuan, and 70 bags of Jiangbei dried sweet potato at a price of 105 to 6 yuan.

### Sugar Stocks Continue to Fall Transactions Increase Slightly

Yesterday, sugar stocks of the Sugar Merchants Cooperative Business Office continued to soften due to large-scale sales. The opening price dropped by 1 yuan and 5 jiao to 315 yuan and 5 jiao. The midpoint price was 314 yuan. The closing price was even weaker, closing at 313 yuan and 5 jiao, a total drop of 3 yuan and 5 jiao. The amount of trading increased slightly, with a turnover of 1,200 yuan. There was a lack of supply and demand for red sugar stocks, and no transactions were made.

### New Foreign Coins Square Ingots Inventory Feels Scarce

Recently, the market situation of new foreign coins, new foreign square coins, and new foreign ingots has been fairly active. There are many people asking about the market price. Sporadic transactions are also quite frequent. However, after investigation, the inventory of these goods in Shanghai has been affected by requisition, and spot goods are felt to be in short supply. Therefore, wholesale trading is also difficult to achieve. The industry's sentiment is tending towards both firmness and weariness, and the asking price is only based on the official meeting price, with little profit or loss. Yesterday, the price of new foreign coins was 12,000 yuan per ton. Foreign square coins and ingots were also sold at the same price. However, patterned goods must be priced higher. In addition, the market for metal nails from the factory has an upward trend. The price of a barrel of basic nails will be close to 750 yuan, an increase of 50 yuan compared to the previous price. The standard for white bell silk is also very firm due to the insufficient supply of spot goods. The industry's sentiment is particularly firm, and each market load has been sold for 1,100 yuan.

### Industry Briefs

Xingsi Round Substandard Goods Cheaper The previous lots of higher-priced Xingsi round, because the industry counter-offer was too outrageous, the transactions did not close. However, those with mold and insect damage could not last long in the warehouse, and were opened for sale yesterday following the market, with a difference of about 300 yuan compared to the higher-priced goods. After selecting for mold and insect damage, the cost is no less than that of the higher-priced goods, so there were few buyers.

Galin Vegetables Arrive in Small Quantities Firmly Due to the long-term lack of Galin vegetables, the inventory on the market, including refrigerated warehouse goods, is less than 1,000 packages in total, so the market is not easy to see loose. The current market price for fine Western Galin vegetables is 1,000 yuan, second-grade 900 yuan, and Dragon Tooth vegetables 830 yuan.

Honeysuckle Season Sales Continue to Tighten Ordinary honeysuckle, the Nan City number board recently opened and rose another 50 yuan. Yesterday, another five pieces were opened, with a higher price of 1,750 yuan, which was then handled by the Xiamen gang for 1,800 yuan. The current sales order is very active. In addition, the Northern exchange is difficult to loosen, and the drafts are not light, with no thick profits to be expected.

Cigarettes Have No Big Difference The cigarette market is still quiet, and the sentiment on all sides is increasingly sluggish. Actual sales are also clear, so the price has no big difference. British Brand 8,700 yuan, Old Knife Brand 5,400 yuan, Pinhai Brand 4,600 yuan, Wuhua Brand 3,550 yuan, Fairy Brand 3,700 yuan, Japanese Tobacco Golden Gun Brand 1,350 yuan, Golden Building Brand 1,950 yuan, Red Rose 1,000 yuan, Guide Brand 1,200 yuan, National Tobacco Golden Mouse Brand 1,500 yuan, Beautiful Brand 2,900 yuan, Golden Pyramid Brand 2,850 yuan, very little buying and selling.

### The Recent Passing of Cheng Jixian

— Sick Dove

Not long after Yan Jupeng's passing, the veteran actor Cheng Jixian also passed away in Beijing on the 7th! Cheng enjoyed 69 years of age. His situation after death was bleak, and his funeral was taken care of by his disciple Ye Shengli. For a famous actor of his generation to meet such an end is truly a great tragedy!

Cheng Jixian was the direct grandson of Cheng Gengzhi and came from the Xiaorongchun opera school. His was a family of performers. In today's Peking opera scene, he is already respected as a senior and a model Xiaosheng. He was skilled in Kunqu and all kinds of miscellaneous opera, and proficient in both civil and military roles. Although his singing was slightly lacking, his skill was exquisite and had reached a state of perfection. Unfortunately, his later years were not good. Since leaving the Qiusheng Society, his livelihood became a problem. He once formed an elderly troupe with Shang Heyu, Shi Huibao, and Xiao Changhua, performing in Tianjin and Beijing, but because they were old and faded, they were not valued, and the troupe soon disbanded. Last year, he followed Xi Xiaobo and Hou Yulan to the south, occasionally performing on stage, with a fine spirit. I once watched several of his plays, such as "Heroes' Meeting" and "Imperial Stele Pavilion." When he appeared on stage, his body was stooped, his voice tired, and his energy waning. The unrestrained and heroic spirit was no longer visible. However, his movements were steady, his enunciation was clear, and his style was still there. Jixian was stubborn by nature and did not follow the trends. When he was popular, someone asked him to perform Zhou Yu in "Borrowing the East Wind," but he only performed up to the point of striking the lid, because the old version of "Heroes' Meeting" did not often borrow the wind. His attitude was so stubborn. Looking at his recent years, due to financial difficulties, he reversed his old ways, and people disliked him for being old and abandoned him. Was it because poverty shortens ambition?

Cheng, Shi Huibao, Shang Heyu, and Xiao Changhua were respected as the Four Elders by people in the Peking opera scene in the old capital. All four were outstanding figures of their kind who were still around. Now that Jixian has passed away, while Shi and Shang are still impoverished, recalling the ambitious days when they organized the elderly troupe, there must be a great sense of emotion. Jixian's art was mostly passed down from Yang Rongshou. His martial Xiaosheng plays, such as "Exploring the Village," "Eight Great Hammers," and "Suppressing Tanzhou," were once dominant. He once acted with Lao Tan and was equal in skill. People at that time praised him. In the past, there were three Xiaosheng immortals in the old capital, namely Xu Diexian, Wang Lengxian, and Cheng Jixian. It can be seen how much he was valued. He was very strict in teaching, selecting talents to teach, and unwilling to pass on his skills lightly. In today's theater scene, rising Xiaosheng stars such as Ye Shenglan, Bai Yunsheng, Yu Zhenfei, and Xu Huilie are among his disciples and have been cultivated by him, which proves that this statement is not false.

### Peking Opera News

— A Theater Fan

Song Dezhu's troupe will arrive in Shanghai on the 24th and will perform at the Xinxin Theater from August 1st.

Huang Jin and Huang Guiqiu and others are scheduled to return north within days. Yu Zhenfei also intends to return north to handle his teacher Cheng Jixian's funeral.

Song Shiluo and others will finish performing at the Xinxin Theater today and will move to the Golden Theater on the 18th for a period of half a month.

After Yan Jupeng's death, his wife, Ms. Gao Yian, returned north from Shanghai to pay her respects and fulfill her duties as a wife.

The students of the Shanghai Opera School will perform at the Xinxin Theater until the end of this month and will take a month off for summer break.

### My View of "Madame Butterfly"

— Xu Yige

Based on my own opinion, in the Chinese film industry, Yuan Meiyun and Chen Yanyan, who starred in "Madame Butterfly" this time, are the better actresses in tragedies.

"Madame Butterfly" is a tragedy. The outline of the story should be said to be based on the Western film "Madame Butterfly." The difference is that the male protagonist of China United's "Madame Butterfly" is a relatively enthusiastic university student, while the other is a sailor who forgets everything.

Li Pingqian is a director with delicate skills. He knows where to make the actors laugh and where to make them cry. However, regrettably, when her lover had left for more than a year without returning, the various expressions of Madame Butterfly were not enough to reach the level of sadness. This is not because the actor's acting skills were poor, but because the director gave her too few opportunities.

Her face can reveal true feelings, neither excessive nor forced. This advantage of "just right" is not something that newcomers in recent years can match. When Madame Butterfly returned from Beiping, she brought back the news that her lover had already married. In the instant before the suicide, the sad smile in front of the servant, hiding infinite pain, is the performance.

The male protagonist is Liu Qiong. His expression when he received the false report that "Butterfly Girl has an owner" was very able to make people understand the pain of the character in the play. However, Liu Qiong rarely showed any expression of comfort to his wife (played by Chen Qi), which is inevitably a shortcoming. It is also regrettable that Chen Qi was given too few opportunities to act this time.

### Sherlock Holmes Premieres Today

— Tianma

The Last Major Collaboration of Famous Actors

Sets and Costumes Break All Previous Records

Bringing detective plays to the stage is indeed a difficult task. Rongwei Company once concentrated manpower and material resources to prepare the play "Sherlock Holmes." As a result, the company terminated its contract with the Lyceum Theatre, and the play was suspended. However, the original cast of "Sherlock Holmes" was unwilling to disappoint the eagerly waiting audience. Therefore, they persevered and spent more financial and human resources to continue preparations for more than a month. Today, they will meet the audience at the Lyceum Theatre.

The plot of Sherlock Holmes, the story of this great detective, is of course familiar to everyone and does not need to be introduced in detail. However, the performance of the stage play "Sherlock Holmes" must be described in general:

The scenery has been rushedly made for weeks, with infinite mysteries. The customized costumes cost a huge amount, completely in the British style. In addition, the makeup is so realistic that you almost don't know that it is a group of Chinese people acting, The detective and the robbers fight fiercely, with no room to breathe, and there is also a full orchestra accompaniment, bringing out the effect of sound, which further increases the tense atmosphere.

There is one more thing to report to the theater audience. After Rongwei Company stopped, many more theater groups were established, and many excellent actors were dispersed to other theater groups. Therefore, in the future, there will probably be no chance to see a play with such a strong lineup and a great gathering of famous actors like "Sherlock Holmes." The Ziguang Troupe, formed by the female students of the Aurora Middle School, held its first performance on the 12th. The proceeds from the tickets were donated to the Tushan Bay Orphanage. The picture shows a scene from "The Parasitic Vine".

### Artistic Landscape

— Yu

Shanghai Art will stage "The Money Tree" from the 16th to the end of July, and Gu Zhongyi's adapted "Regaining Sight" from August 1st.

Li Yi recently completed a three-act comedy "Between Men and Women" with the story of an old maid as its theme, which will be performed by Shanghai Art after "Regaining Sight".

Mr. He Haisheng of the Xinxin Stage is recently planning a drama group and is also looking for a suitable venue for performances in the Jing'an Temple Road area. It is heard that the mature period is not far away.

Yue Feng's adaptation and direction of "Wasted Youth" opened filming on the 7th. The main actors include Chen Yanyan as Bai Ping, Gao Zhanfei as Lei Ming, Zheng Xun as Zhuo Da, and Zhao Zhenni as

It is now heard that Huang Han intends to adapt and remake "White Cloud Pagoda", a silent film starring Hu Die in the silent film era of Mingxing Company.

Zhu Shilin began writing "Phoenix Facing the Sun" after the Grand View Garden in the Sea, with Chen Yunshang in mind for the female lead.

### Sharing the Same Boat in Storms

— By He Jia Zhi

(7) Thunderbolt

Wei Cheng said, "I respect you as Mr. Wei, and it's right to repay the money, but I don't have it today. You don't need to come urging me for this matter. We have to wait until the autumn harvest is in and we can make an estimate. We'll either repay all of it, half of it, or a fraction of it. We'll talk about it when that time comes." Wei Shaoyun's attitude softened somewhat, saying, "Why not repay a portion now, and you can repay less in the future? Isn't it the same? I'm genuinely worried about the interest you're incurring. If you don't repay the principal, the interest keeps piling up day by day. When it's time to repay, and you can't, the interest turns into principal again."

Wei Cheng didn't feel much, but Cui Zhen became worried and rushed to tell Second Madam Ye. Second Madam Ye had just woken up from her midday nap and was worried that Wei Yunqing had sent his son Wei Shaoyun to demand the debt, and that Wei Cheng wasn't used to dealing with such matters, so she went outside. She saw Wei Cheng alone in the house and didn't see Wei Shaoyun. Second Madam Ye asked, "Who came?" Wei Cheng replied, "Oh, just a little local tyrant. He came abruptly, asking me for money. Even if I had money, I wouldn't give it to him. He said that one of your cows could be worth some money, and there's a market price for it at the gambling den. I gave him a scolding and chased him out." Second Madam Ye said, "There's no need to scold him; just talk to him nicely." Wei Cheng said, "If I don't scold this kind of person, there's no one else in the world worth scolding. Being in debt is one thing, but his evil intentions are another. Why did he have to ask about our cow? Anything that belongs to my family is off-limits for him to ask about, whether it's a person, a cow, or a dog."

Seeing that Wei Cheng was angry, Second Madam Ye began to tell him a story about Wei Shaoyun. She said, "I heard that once, the money Wei Yunqing lent out was still in Wei Shaoyun's hands, and Wei Shaoyun spent it all in two days without coming home. He went to the Guan Yu Temple, snatched the big sword from Zhou Cang's hand, and took it back to Wei Yunqing, saying, 'My son is unfilial and spent the money you worked so hard to earn. There's no other way but to ask you to kill this unfilial son.' Wei Yunqing was enraged and grabbed the sword, chopping it down on Wei Shaoyun's head. Wei Shaoyun quickly grabbed the sword, saying, 'Your son has already given you face, why won't you give your son face? Mother, please intercede! Just treat me like your grandson, not your son. If you treat me like your grandson, you'll love your grandson and be reluctant to chop me down!'" (128)
