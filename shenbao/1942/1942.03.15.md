### The Fall of Rangoon is a Major Blow; Warfare Nears India; Wavell Discusses the Military Situation

New Delhi, 14th (Reuters) – General Wavell, Commander-in-Chief of India, yesterday met with foreign correspondents, outlining the military situation. He briefly mentioned that the loss of Rangoon and most of Lower Burma is in some respects a more serious blow than the fall of Singapore, as the war is now increasingly approaching India. He said that our preparations were inadequate, reinforcements arrived too late, and were not sufficiently trained.

New Delhi, 14th (Havas) – The former Supreme Commander of the Southwest Pacific Allied Forces, now the Commander-in-Chief of the British Army in India, General Wavell, delivered a lengthy speech to the press today, emphasizing the grave significance of the fall of Rangoon. He stated, "The loss of Rangoon and southern Burma will ultimately prove to be even more important than the setbacks we suffered in Singapore. The reason is that after the fall of Rangoon, not only has our communication with our ally China been obstructed, but the war has already approached the gateway to India. In the past, our preparations were inadequate, reinforcements arrived too late, and to add to that, most of these reinforcements were poorly trained. Now that the Japanese army has the possibility of invading India by sea, we should learn from our past mistakes and take various measures to prevent it. In the British headquarters, we have always adopted a fixed line of defense, but the difficulty of defending India with this strategy is already obvious. In essence, our line of defense must become a very mobile one in the future. The main principle is to switch to offensive tactics. In threatened areas, we must have a large number of mobile units, and we must build more airfields, request the government to send fresh troops continuously, and the merchant ships previously requisitioned should also be formed into small fleets to undertake patrol work, even patrolling the rivers. Speaking of the Java campaign, before I set off for the war zone, I had the opportunity to meet with you. At that time, I was racing against time. In other words, my combat plan was entirely dependent on whether our land and air reinforcements could arrive in time to stop the Japanese advance. As a result of the race, we eventually failed in four or five weeks. The reason is that the date on which our reinforcements arrived was later than we had hoped, and the Japanese advanced faster than we had expected. Under these circumstances, it can be seen that the Dutch East Indies incident should not be judged hastily before the truth is investigated. What I can tell you is that the crux of the matter is that we were never prepared to fight in the Far East. If we had, we would have drawn troops from places where the threat was not so urgent, such as the Middle East and the British headquarters, to come to the Far East earlier. If so, we would have been better prepared to fight in the Far East. Also, when the Soviet Red Army was correcting the mistakes we had made before, if we could have stopped supplying the Soviet Union with military equipment and instead supplied the Far East, we would have obtained more military equipment in the Far East. At this point, a reporter asked about the situation when Rangoon fell. General Wavell immediately replied that our defense line stretched from northern Thailand to the Tenasserim area, running parallel to our lines of communication, so we had to fight hard under difficult conditions. In addition, the terrain between the eastern resistance line and Rangoon was very narrow, and we were unable to fully fortify it. In short, we made many mistakes in that area. Moreover, the fact that the Japanese army was able to adopt effective strategies and advance rapidly in this difficult area was beyond our expectations. Furthermore, most of our troops were not sufficiently trained, and it was difficult for them to resist the Japanese army in the dense jungles. However, all our officers and soldiers fought bravely until the very last moment. As of today, it is difficult for us to know how the Japanese army will use its victory to continue to advance, as they are free to choose among Hawaii, Australia, Siberia, Burma, China, India, and Ceylon."

Xi’an, 14th (Haitong News Agency) – According to news received here from New Delhi last night, General Wavell, Commander-in-Chief of the British Army in India, declared to the press yesterday that the fall of Rangoon and southern Burma was a more serious blow to Britain than the fall of Malaya and Singapore. The war has reached the gateway to India, and Britain has reached a critical juncture. Burma has followed in the footsteps of Malaya entirely due to a lack of preparation for war, the late arrival of reinforcements, and the inadequate training and equipment of imperial troops.

### British Army Determined to Defend Ceylon at All Costs; The Island's Gain or Loss is of Great Importance; British, American, and Dutch Reinforcements Have Arrived

Colombo, Ceylon, 13th (Havas) – Although Japan and Ceylon are far apart, British officials do not hide the fact that this strategically important island is difficult to defend, especially if the Japanese army occupies the two islands east of Ceylon, Ceylon will be even more threatened. Since the fall of Penang and Singapore, Ceylon has become Britain's foremost base in the Far East. If Britain wants to protect the Indian Ocean trade route and prevent the hope of a final counter-offensive from being completely cut off, it must defend the island at all costs. Not only that, Ceylon is also extremely important in protecting the ports of the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf from intrusion. The supplies for the Allied forces in the Soviet Union and the Middle East are transported through these ports. In addition, if Ceylon falls, the communication line between Britain and the Indian Empire will be controlled by the Japanese on both the east and west sides of the Indian Peninsula, and India will be completely isolated from the outside world. Fortunately, British, American, and Dutch reinforcements have already arrived in Ceylon, and new airfields are being built along the island's east coast, and various measures are being taken to improve the Trincomalee naval base in the southeastern part of the island.

Since December 8th of last year, shipping between this city and Southeast Asia, Europe, and the United States has been suspended for more than three months. In late January of this year, two French ships arrived in Shanghai from Vietnam, and then returned to Vietnam in February. The French mail ship D'Artagnan, which arrived in port before the outbreak of the Pacific War, also sailed back to Saigon on the 24th of last month.

Hua Lun Shipping Company has ceased operations

There is also the French ship Z.S.G.G.A. Varenne, which also arrived in Shanghai before December 8th of last year and was represented by the Norwegian Hua Lun Shipping Company. Due to the Pacific War, it was unable to return to Vietnam. Later, it was leased by the Japanese Asia Company to operate on the Shanghai-Qingdao line, transporting coal. It is heard that the lease is about to expire, and Hua Lun Shipping Company has now ceased operations. The head office of the Hai Fang Shipping Company recently entrusted the French Post Office Company in this city to take back the ship after its term expires and return it to Haiphong. It is also learned that the Asia Company intends to renew the lease and is currently negotiating.

No News of Shanghai-Hong Kong Service

Due to the obstruction of shipping routes, there is no hope of resumption of navigation for the time being. It has been confirmed that the French company's cargo ship Xijiang was bombed and destroyed in the Philippines.

### Najian's Conversation: Crack Down on Impersonators

Recently, there have been frequent incidents in this city of people impersonating the Japanese military police or the military headquarters to extort money and intimidate residents. The Japanese military police are making efforts to crack down on this. Shanghai Military Police Captain Najian gave a brief speech, stating, "Since the outbreak of the East Asian War, the Shanghai Military Police have cracked down on all illegal elements who take advantage of people's anxiety to impersonate the military police or the military headquarters to commit various illegal acts. Regarding such cases, 29 cases involving 108 criminals have been filed, but unfortunately, they have not yet been completely eradicated. When the military police exercise police powers such as detaining or summoning people, they must send military police from the military police headquarters to exercise those powers. Their measures are legal, fair, and impartial, and they will never exercise illegal or unreasonable powers. Residents should ask anyone who claims to be military police or Japanese soldiers to show their identification. If there is anything suspicious about their actions, they should immediately notify the nearest military police headquarters or other officials. If they know the criminals, they should report them in secret so that they can be filed and avoid being deceived. The authorities will keep the reports of these incidents strictly confidential, so there is no need to worry about any future troubles, and we welcome secret reports. Even if the information in the report is incorrect, we will not pursue it. We would like to call everyone's attention."

At the opening, the price per "tiao" (10 taels) was 18,200 yuan, 250 yuan higher than the previous day's noon price, and the same as the previous day's off-exchange closing price.

### No Major Fluctuations in Government Bonds

The government bond unofficial market was stable yesterday. The prices of those that had risen the previous day saw a slight pullback, while those that had fallen saw a slight rebound. There was nothing more than mutual swapping, and trading decreased. There was no longer enthusiastic momentum, and there was a feeling of satisfaction.

Tongkang, Tongyi, Dazhong, and Dingkang were all sellers. Zhongfu bought Category D and sold Category C.

There were no major changes in the others.

Spring and Autumn

### Violently Bashing into a Telegraph Pole - Meng Si

Today's weather is unpleasant, everything is gray. When I got to the alley entrance, there was a large crowd of people gathered there. In the center of the circle was a young worker, who looked to be in his thirties. He was wearing a blue cloth shirt and trousers, which were a bit tattered, but very clean. His face was flushed, his eyes were wide open, almost popping out of their sockets, his head was shaking, and his hands were holding a telegraph pole; he was obviously having trouble supporting himself. I thought it was another case of epilepsy or something like that.

"…Alive…Um…" He hummed like that, followed by a scene that was more great than tragic. I was so startled that I almost closed my eyes: he slammed his head violently against the telegraph pole.

"Bang" The man fell down. No one went up to help him, everyone just watched quietly, as if calmly speculating whether he was "dead". Sure enough, he slowly woke up, struggling to get up, and when he straightened up, he slammed into the telegraph pole again. I wanted to stop him from such a foolish act, but I also thought it might be better for him to die than to save him. Gradually, this happened again and again, and the "spectators" became a little numb. Someone spoke up.

"What a sin!"

"Why seek death!?"

"It's unavoidable!"

One person shouted as if he had discovered a miracle: "He's still wearing a hat!" At this time, everyone temporarily abandoned their discussions and focused their eyes on his felt hat. A "spectator" said in a very calm and humorous tone: "If you want to seek death, you should hit the iron pillar across the street." No one could guess his meaning, whether it was sarcasm or some other purpose; looking at his serious face, it seemed like he was instructing the "friend seeking death".

Everyone's new conclusion came again, saying that he was using a "bitter trick", that doing so, although painful, was more effective than begging like a "lady".

I didn't have the courage to watch any longer, and my own forehead seemed to be aching faintly.

Entertainments Anecdotes

### Shanxi Opera - Ze Fu

In Shanxi folk drama, in addition to the grand opera "Bangzi" and the small opera "Yangge" being extremely popular, there are also miscellaneous operas such as "Huihui" and "Eight-Person Band", which are unheard of in other provinces. These miscellaneous operas are mostly freely assembled by drama enthusiasts for costumed performances. There is no professional nature to speak of. In the past, Huihui performances mostly adopted a certain plot from old operas, such as "The Big-Headed Monk Teasing Yingying", which was adapted from "Romance of the West Chamber". In recent years, they have also performed many self-composed new dramas, such as "The Opium Addict" and "The Gambling Addict", all of which have the effect of awakening the public and are quite valuable in social education. The Eight-Person Band is a newly emerging drama in recent years. Each band has about eight actors, hence the name. Its nature is slightly the same as Yangge, but it is even more popular than Yangge. The lyrics are also very lewd. Most of them are rural stories, such as "Cutting Green Vegetables", "Stealing Watermelons", and "Picking Coriander", all of which are very close to the real lives of farmers, so they are very popular with the public and are gradually becoming professional. These actors are gathered temporarily, so there is no equipment to speak of. The so-called costumes and clothing, except for special ones, are mostly borrowed from local residents; and performances are mostly held during the lunar new year and slack farming season, it is said.

### Stage and Screen - Tai Xu

Jin Suwen's new husband, Hu Tiwei, has recently completed a stage play, titled "Human World". Suwen, is eager to participate in the performance, hence some say that the script was specially written for Jin Suwen by Hu Tiwei.

Chen Qi moved into Dacheng yesterday to film "A Date After Dusk".

There are two makeup artists in the film industry who are attracting attention. One is Chen Shaozhou, and the other is Song Xiaojiang, who did the makeup for Confucius for Tang Huaiqiu; it was Song Xiaojiang who worked on the muddle-headed magistrate in "Carnival Night". Now that Carlton has specially asked Song Xiaojiang to help to make the strange accent of "The Hunchback of Notre Dame" more realistic, Song Xiaojiang hopes that the Asia Cinema will re-screen Charles Laughton's "The Hunchback of Notre Dame" once, and Zhou Qi (who plays the hunchback) also wants to see it once, it is said.

Yang Liu, who accompanies the singing at the Lido Ballroom, recently went to Suzhou to work on the docks and returned to Shanghai the day before yesterday.

### Past · Present

— Pei

In the past, a load of rice, now a meal.

In the past, a suit, now a pair of shoes.

In the past, a foot of cloth, now a needle.

In the past, two preserved eggs, now a coal briquette.

In the past, a pound of meat, now a piece of tofu.

But, how many people who used to earn a salary of one or two hundred now have it increased to two or three thousand?

### Sharing the Same Boat in Storms

— He Jia Zhi

2.  Sorrow and Joy

Li Youxie was not advertising for Huang Shifu; indeed, the villagers who died after taking Huang Shifu's medicine were said to have died without regret. Wei Cheng, hearing his uncle say this, naturally did not object anymore; A Xing had already gone to Flower Harbor. Wei Cheng went to his mother's room again and asked, "How is she now?" The people in the room only replied with some comforting tone, saying, "She's a little better." Although they said that, no one could point out where she was better. Madam Ye was still in a state of sleep, her face pale, her appearance haggard, her lips scorched black, all of which were telling people that her illness was serious. Wei Cheng sat on the edge of the bed and said sadly, "It's truly something I never expected in my dreams." Li Youxie took a drag of his cigarette, quickly blew out a mouthful of smoke, and said, "After taking Mr. Huang's medicine, the illness will be cured. Mr. Huang's prescription from yesterday, you can give it to Wei Cheng to see." Cui Zhen immediately took out the prescription from a mirror box and handed it to Wei Cheng. The eldest aunt said, "Yesterday you used antelope horn tip, are you still using antelope horn tip today?" Wei Cheng nodded. The second aunt said, "Wei Cheng, don't worry. Sister-in-law will be blessed by the heavens and her illness will get better. Didn't we have one last year too, didn't we use the prescription of the 'mad' Huang? Once the storm passes, everything will be fine." Madam Ye the second said, "I'm most afraid of Wei Cheng worrying. Sister-in-law's illness is a chronic one, worrying won't help." Li Youxie said, "In both houses, there's only this one boy, mother, aunt, everyone treats him like their own life. I always say, in a year, once he marries a wife, it'll be better."

The conversation developed to focus on Wei Cheng, and Wei Cheng dropped a tear on the prescription. A magpie came to invite them to breakfast, and Wei Cheng said, "I'm not hungry. Uncle, go eat, aunt, go eat, I'm really not hungry." Madam Ye the second said, "You have to eat, now we're only worried about your mother, if you don't eat, we'll worry about you too." Almost everyone urged Wei Cheng to eat, Madam Ye the second knew that Wei Cheng liked to eat poached chicken eggs, so she cooked some, but Wei Cheng only ate one and gave the rest to the magpie to take away.
