### U.S. and Britain Plan Memorandum, Will Restore North African Shipping, France Maintains Neutrality in U.S.-German War, Islands and Fleets Will Never Be Transferred

Washington, 22nd (Reuters) – After the Vichy government guaranteed that it would not arbitrarily transfer Madagascar Island in the Indian Ocean and the French fleet to the Axis powers, British and American delegations have been drafting a memorandum at the State Department to restore North African shipping to transport food and other supplies to the French people there. However, this memorandum must be approved by President Roosevelt before it can be implemented. In addition, according to unofficial sources, French leader Pétain has assured U.S. Ambassador to France Leahy that no vessels of the French fleet will be moved from their current berthing locations.

Vichy, 21st (Havas) – On the 21st of last month, a sailor from a German submarine landed on the French West Indian island of Martinique. The responsible authorities here issued a statement today, emphasizing France's absolute neutrality regarding the U.S.-German war, which will not be altered in any way. In its recent note to France, the U.S. government mentioned the agreement reached between the French and American naval commanders in the Caribbean Sea in October 1940. This agreement was established before the U.S. and Germany went to war, that is, before the French government formally declared neutrality, but it remains valid in France's eyes. The French government is able to reaffirm its assurances to the United States based on this agreement and its neutrality policy. Therefore, it is believed here that the landing of a German soldier on Martinique Island on the 21st of last month should not be regarded as a violation of neutrality. This statement merely reiterates the consistent stance.

Vichy, 21st (Havas) – France and the United States have signed an agreement prohibiting German and American ships from docking at the ports of French Martinique. This agreement was made because the U.S. protested to France about a German submarine transporting injured crew members who landed at Fort-de-France. The United States reminded France to remember its obligations as a neutral country. France argued that rescuing wounded soldiers did not violate neutrality laws. Subsequently, the French Ambassador to the United States, Henri-Haye, signed this agreement with the U.S. Secretary of State.

New York, 21st (Havas) – Regarding the landing of a German submarine sailor on French Martinique, according to local newspapers, after the United States raised the issue, the French government provided various assurances to Washington. The incident occurred because a German sailor needed urgent surgery for a leg ulcer and landed on Martinique Island. The German submarine remained in port for only ninety minutes, undergoing neither repairs nor contacting the French authorities. The submarine was closely monitored by the authorities. Afterwards, the U.S. government requested that the French government reiterate its previous promise, stating that French Martinique would not be used as a base for the Axis powers. Otherwise, the United States would have to occupy the French islands in the Caribbean Sea. The French government immediately reaffirmed its assurances, stating that France would strictly adhere to neutrality and would not provide any assistance to either side of the warring parties, and would allow the United States to send observers to Martinique Island during the war and patrol the surrounding waters. The United States government should be satisfied with this.

Sydney, 21st (Havas) – The Sydney Daily Telegraph recently published an editorial, stating that the transfer of Ambassador Casey to the British Special Envoy to the Middle East is a bizarre matter that should be investigated. Prime Minister Churchill's report to the House of Commons did not provide a sufficient explanation. British and Australian politicians have warned Churchill that it would be unwise to replace Australia's ambassador to the United States at this time. The Australian government has also clearly expressed its opinion, but Prime Minister Churchill has disregarded it. Therefore, the Australian government should instruct Casey to remain in Washington, or Churchill should suggest candidates to Prime Minister Curtin to succeed Casey, not knowing that Curtin does not need such advice. The policy that our Prime Minister should follow is that all important positions should be filled by purely Australian officers.

### Japan-Soviet Fisheries Agreement Content of Agreement

Moscow, 22nd –

According to the Soviet announcement, Soviet People's Committee Vice Chairman Vyshinsky signed an agreement with Japanese Ambassador Tatekawa in Kuybyshev on the 20th, extending the 1928 Japan-Soviet Fisheries Agreement for one year (1942). The two parties also exchanged documents regarding this matter. The fisheries agreement between Japan and the Soviet Union signed in 1928 expired in May 1936. In view of the failure to conclude a new fisheries agreement, the two governments have extended the agreement annually for one year. In other words, after the agreement expired in 1936, it was extended annually for the years 1937, 38, 39, 40, and 41. As a result of recent negotiations between the two sides, the following terms have been agreed upon:

Article 1: The Japanese government agrees that Japanese fishing companies will cease participating in the auction of five fishing zones. These five fishing zones are part of the nineteen fishing zones whose lease term expired in 1941.

Article 2: The Japanese government agrees to pay an additional 20 percent of the rental fee and taxes, in addition to the various payments to be paid by the Japanese fishing companies.

Article 3: The rental fee for the fishing zones to be leased by Japanese fishing companies in the 1942 auction will be increased by 10 percent based on the principles of the document dated April 2, 1930, and the Japanese side must pay additional amounts. In view of the changes in the procedures for paying fishing zone leases, the Japanese government, at the request of the Soviet State Bank, agrees to pay in gold bullion. The Japanese side may transport gold bullion or foreign currency (at the discretion of the Soviet State Bank) to Vladivostok.

Article 4: The Japanese government also agrees that Japanese fishing companies must pay an additional 4 percent to the Soviet government when paying in gold bullion as a fee for transporting the gold bullion.

### Fenghua Association Evacuates Unemployed Fellow Villagers

The Fenghua Fellow Villagers Association in Shanghai has recently established an office to assist the Concession authorities in evacuating residents who do not need to stay in Shanghai. The office is dedicated to helping fellow villagers returning to their hometowns obtain special return travel permits. The number of people going to the association to obtain permits has increased significantly recently. It is reported that the journey from Shanghai to Ningbo and then back to Fenghua has become smoother than before. After arriving in Ningbo, travelers can take a small steamer to Xiwu Port, which only takes five or six hours, and the ticket price is about one yuan. It only takes a few hours to enter the city after arriving at Xiwu.

According to news from Ningbo organizations in Shanghai, the Ningbo Shanghai Fellow Villagers Resettlement Team, operated in Ningbo, aims to assist unemployed returnees, those with limited luggage, female factory workers who have run out of money, orphans with no one to rely on, and other returnees facing difficulties. The team sends members to meet each arriving ship from Shanghai, identify those in the above situations, talk to them, and explain the team's goals to benefit them. As a result, the number of people assisted each time is quite large. It is reported that the team plans to allocate more than 100,000 yuan to carry out this relief effort.

### New Methods of Rice Cultivation (Continued and Concluded)

Fertilizers: The hope of increasing rice production with fertilizer is 50%. Compared to seed selection, which only achieves 10% to 20%, its importance is clear. Ordinary paddy fields must replenish nitrogen and phosphorus. The best fertilizers for paddy fields are "ammonium sulfate" and "superphosphate of lime." However, it is necessary to test the soil first and then make appropriate supplements. Irrigation: The most important key to increasing rice production lies in irrigation. Without irrigation, there is simply no solution. It's like humans needing air. The best paddy fields are located near rivers, making water lifting more convenient. Human power, animal power, or machine power can be used. If farmers can organize water-lifting cooperatives and invest freely, they can then use electric power to lift water, saving labor and money, which is truly a win-win situation. Farm Tools: Among the contributions of science, Japanese-style cultivators and threshers are the most convenient. We can imitate them in our country.

Insect Pests: There are two main diseases of rice: one is rice blast, and the other is sesame leaf spot disease. If we pay attention to seed selection and farmers work together to prevent them, these diseases and pests can be reduced. As for rice pests, one is the rice stem borer, and the other is the rice leaf roller. Stored grain pests include grain moths, grain weevils, and grain borers. Recently, there has also been a method of prevention: covering the top of the granary with a layer of yellow sand, which can control these grain insects. Other methods include cooperative rice nurseries, where farmers use the same amount of improved seeds to jointly germinate seedlings, and then transplant them. As for the method of transplanting seedlings in rows, if you want to make the rows neat, you can imitate the Japanese-style "straight-row planting," a hexagonal wooden frame, which is pulled and pushed by manpower to draw intersecting patterns on the paddy field, and then the seedlings are transplanted, which can be very neat. New Method of Planting Chinese Yam: The second question is the new method of planting Chinese yam. Due to time constraints, I will briefly describe one or two points for reference. The soil for planting Chinese yam must be loose and well-drained. If it is too sticky and moist, it is not suitable. Fertilizers need potassium, nitrogen, and wood ash. If you want to make the Chinese yam larger, you can use the "hybrid vigor" invented by Americans in 1939. Chinese yam planted in this way can be doubled in size, and the yield will naturally increase.

### Japanese Army and Navy Issue Measures: Taking Over British and American Enterprises in Central China

Shanghai Allied News Agency: Since December 8th of last year, the Japanese Army and Navy authorities in Shanghai have been taking over and managing British and American enemy-owned enterprises in various parts of Central China that are deemed unsuitable for operation by enemy nationals due to the ongoing war. Detailed measures were announced yesterday (the 22nd). At the same time, the heads of the Japanese Army and Navy's Public Relations Department issued a statement clarifying the significance of this move.

The full text of the announcement is as follows: In order to achieve the goals of the Greater East Asia War, the Greater Japanese Army and Navy in Shanghai will, from December 8, Showa 16 (1941), transfer the management of enemy-owned enterprises in Central China (excluding the Wuhan area) that are deemed unsuitable for operation by enemy nationals to the Japanese military. According to the following items, the highest commanders of the Greater Japanese Empire's Army and Navy in the Shanghai area will manage these enterprises. Japanese military-managed enterprises will be directly managed by the Army and Navy units to the extent necessary for military purposes, or the highest commanders of the Army and Navy will designate entrusted operations, or establish managers, supervisors, etc., to assume management responsibility. Among the Japanese military-managed enterprises, with the exception of those directly managed by the Army and Navy units, all management affairs will be handled by the Director-General of the Central China Liaison Department of the Asia Development Board. The original owners of the Japanese military-managed enterprises, or those who originally had operating rights, will have all their legal actions regarding the enterprises invalidated during the period of Japanese military management, unless specifically approved by the highest commanders of the Army and Navy. Those with claims, debts, or other property interests related to Japanese military-managed enterprises should notify the trustees or supervisors by April 30, Showa 17 (1942). Regarding claims and debts established before December 7, Showa 16 (1941), related to Japanese military-managed enterprises, our side will exercise or perform them in accordance with the following items, but exceptions will be made if there are reasons why our side cannot be held responsible for not being able to exercise or perform them. A. Claims will be exercised by the trustees or managers. B. Debts will be performed by the trustees or managers within the scope of the assets of the enterprise as of December 8, Showa 16 (1941), and only to the extent that it does not hinder future operations. If it is necessary for military or other related reasons to order changes to the already designated Japanese military management methods, or to sell the assets of Japanese military-managed enterprises, or other dispositions, the highest commanders of the Army and Navy will designate the Japanese military-managed enterprises. Enterprises with enemy nationality as of December 8, Showa 16 (1941), and enterprises invested in by enemy countries or enemy nationals, other than those already announced to be managed by the Japanese military, should report to the Central China Liaison Department of the Asia Development Board by April 20, Showa 17 (1942).

Content of the Statement: The Japanese Army and Navy in Shanghai will, from December 8, Showa 16 (1941), manage enemy-owned enterprises in Central China (excluding the Wuhan area) and have decided on management methods, which were announced on the 23rd. Today, Japan bears the great mission of freeing the people of East Asia from the political and economic shackles of Britain and the United States and is moving towards the completion of the Greater East Asia War. Therefore, it is necessary to mobilize various economic facilities within the East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere and make the most effective use of them in order to enrich the co-prosperity and national defense of the East Asian nations. However, important economic facilities in Shanghai have been controlled by British and American merchants. If these enterprises continue to be operated by British and American merchants as in the past, it would be extremely inappropriate in terms of carrying out the Greater East Asia War. The Japanese Army and Navy, in view of this, have transferred the management of British and American enterprises that are deemed unsuitable for operation by enemy nationals to the Japanese military. In addition, enemy-owned Chinese enterprises that do not understand the true meaning of Sino-Japanese cooperation and hinder our economic policies will also be transferred to the Japanese military for management. However, if the entrepreneurs can reflect on their past mistakes and realize that they were wrong, and cooperate to achieve the ideal of Sino-Japanese cooperation, the Japanese military management will be lifted. Those enemy-owned enterprises that are especially necessary for military purposes will be directly used by the Japanese military, or entrusted to a third party designated by us for operation. For others that are necessary for national defense and economy, we will designate managers or send supervisors to manage or supervise them. If any of these enterprises are unsuitable for work, they will be ordered to cease work, and the Japanese side will send managers to sort out and keep them. Enemy-owned enterprises such as banks, insurance companies, and trading companies that have lost their economic function will be liquidated. During the period of Japanese military management of these enemy-owned enterprises, the legal acts of the original rights holders will be invalid, unless specifically approved by us. This is naturally the case from the perspective of the purpose of Japanese military management. In order to avoid economic chaos, the debts that these enterprises should bear before the start of Japanese military management will be limited to those established by December 7, Showa 16 (1941), and will be paid by us within the scope that does not hinder the operation of the Japanese military-managed enterprises. Among the enemy-owned enterprises, those that seek to be managed by the Japanese military, if it is necessary for military purposes in the future, will be ordered to be transferred to the Japanese military for management, or sold off, or otherwise disposed of. It is heard that our overseas Chinese in various British and American countries have been subjected to extremely cruel measures, but our country still maintains the demeanor of a great power, and only manages the minimum necessary for the conduct of the Greater East Asia War, and continues to employ enemy national employees related to these enterprises.

### The Poor Man's Grandmother – the Pawnshop

—Zhi Zhi

The pawnshop is the back door for the poor, and also their grandmother's house. When a hero falls on hard times, this road is not yet cut off, then urgent appeals are not a way to escape from desperation, although "being pawned," "being fooled," has been a common phrase, the impression is not very good, but since commercial capital occupies a great advantage in social economy, pawning is such a thing. The pawnshop door opens in the shape of the character "八," those without goods should not enter. People have put out capital, so they will profit from this capital, this method is legal, and the "pawn interest" is jointly discussed by the industry and has always been approved by the government, and because it is big money, the "pawn merchant" is also considered the most respectable merchant.

The pawn ticket in the bag makes rustling sounds, and occasionally "revealing blue," a group of upper-class gentlemen will stay away, as if a touch of the Great Qing Dynasty's would dissipate the wealth, naturally, it is not as bright and beautiful as a bank check. However, in the countryside, there are many reliable local households, if they have some movable goods like gold jewelry in hand, during the busy farming season, they will secretly want to "insure" them in the pawnshop, and the money they get will be lent to farmers, of course, the interest they extract is very high, comparable to the "usury" of Guangdong's Tiaoyin Mountain; however, the tenants will take this ticket in times of urgent need.

The relationship, if necessary, can also gamble with pawn tickets, although these bosses raise their fox-like eyes and investigate the holder of the pawn ticket to determine the price. Naturally, the poorer, the more difficult, the more difficult, the pawn value is 100 yuan, the pawn ticket price is only one or two or three yuan.

Taking the goods to the "mother's brother's house" to insure them is ultimately different from the warehouse of hoarders. However, it is not easy to live in Shanghai, a group of petty citizens often have a close relationship with "pawn" and "mortgage," until it is "hanging by a thread," either transforming into someone who rides in a car (now a chartered car), or being demoted to someone who lives in the alley.

In the past, the pawn interest was 1.8%, and the transaction could be negotiated and reduced if it was large, which was similar to the commission of a real estate broker, giving a sense of fair trade. Therefore, some young masters often lost urgently, they would drive out a "Citroen" and put a diamond on the high counter, and the principal and interest would be calculated as usual in the morning. There were also some who didn't want to pick up brand new notes, and would exchange them at the pawnshop. ...

However, at a time like this, these leisure activities are probably fewer. At the beginning of this year, the pawnshop industry discussed and increased the monthly interest to 3%. The so-called 3% is actually more than that, (this was also the case in name and in reality in the past) like "storage fee," interest prepaid, ticket face premium, etc., both sides may as well tacitly agree. Now, most of the pawned goods, in addition to the popular women's jewelry, are eating up the price, the price will inevitably rise day and night when writing the ticket and when "packing" at the expiration date, which is very different, therefore, the "call" of the expired goods to the supplier inevitably increases the price, which is the opposite of the psychology of fearing that the pawn customer will not come before the war.

But the reason for increasing the pawn interest is naturally "rising tide lifts all boats," in today's situation, the interest must be increased for more pawns (using neon lights and chrome to decorate the facade, the cost is even higher). However, pawn customers are not experts who intend to "hug tigers," they always want to buy some rice and coal briquettes, but how much can be hoarded by "digging flesh to mend sores?" After careful calculation, they can't help but "throw the ticket" and stomp their feet with three long sighs!

Some humorists tell a joke, saying that not long ago, some shrewd and strong pawnshop experts would also suffer "losses," originally, the price of gold rose rapidly, and the pawned jewelry was sufficient, when the situation changed sharply and gold fell sharply, they could reveal their bad debts. However, this situation is rare after all, and the customer should be "calm" when pawning, and not be greedy for more; and it must also be attributed to the "general trend of the world," and blamed more on the components of "insect-eaten and moldy, each according to fate" engraved on the ticket.

"The ancient saying" goes: The threshold of Chaozhou has eighteen bars, generally "mortgaging" is not as steady as "pawning," but judging the characters of the world is often infallible, even if you are like Feng Yuxiang in his childhood in his hometown of Gegerzhuang pawning things, carefully calculating the interest on the road, is not as accurate as the calculation of a few old on the high counter", that's all.

However, this is ultimately because the situation is getting more and more difficult, so when the poor return to their grandmother's house, they have to bring more "door gifts" to support the scene, isn't it?

### Scribes in Ancient Egypt

— Su Feng

Egyptian culture developed very early. During the Fifth Dynasty, from 2560 to 2420 BC, royal families, wealthy households, and government offices all employed scribes specifically for writing. These individuals formed a special class of excellent people in society. They were exempt from the labor of slaves, served in clean positions, and were highly regarded.

To become a scribe, one had to undergo specialized education, training at the "Scribe" schools in Memphis and Sibus. After graduation, they were not only able to write, read, and draw, but also had considerable foundations in language, literature, and history. In addition, all scribes had to understand arithmetic, accounting, law, personnel, and public administration; mechanics, surveying, and architecture were also required to have some knowledge of.

When writing, they sat cross-legged on the ground, bare-chested, with the front part of their linen skirt stretched out as a "desk." The writing ran from right to left, like Chinese characters. Using the tip of a reed pen, dipped in red and black pigments, they could write freely on papyrus paper. This type of paper was made from the fiber strips of a papyrus plant, processed through weaving, flattening, and polishing.

The "ink" among the Four Treasures of the Study was the red and black pigment, placed in a basin made of alabaster. A string was attached to one end of the basin, dragging a piece of cloth as an "eraser," which was used when writing wrong words or making corrections. In addition to the pigment basin, there was also a stone palette and a copper water bowl for mixing and retouching.

Blank sheets were bundled into rolls, placed in a leather bag with a lid that could be sealed. A leather bag could hold ten or so rolls of paper. The papyrus paper is no longer visible in the "mummies" excavated from ancient Egyptian tombs by later generations, but the linen cloth is still sometimes discovered. The corners of the cloth are engraved with seals, names, or government departments. Most importantly, the dates of weaving are mostly recorded on these linens, which is of great help to archaeologists in determining the age of ancient Egyptian dynasties. Zhu Yu

Historical Anecdotes

### The Origin of Rice

— Zhu Yu

The state of Qi was poor, but not just a "minority" was poor. Here is a wealthy man from the state of Qi, with tens of thousands of gold coins around his waist and a precious son - just a little stupid. He opened a rice store, and the business was so prosperous that it was amazing.

One day, Ai Zi walked past his store and was stopped by him, insisting on inviting Ai Zi to the inner chamber to talk.

The wealthy man said, "I heard that the price of rice has risen again."

"That's another opportunity for you to make a fortune. Although you are rich, I'll be frank, your son is so ignorant of the world that he lacks three points." Ai Zi said, sipping tea.

"I don't believe it!" The wealthy man believed in the "scabby-headed son" doctrine.

"Please bring your son out to try."

The son came out, oily-haired and powdered-faced, wearing brocade and silk, not even knowing how to bow. The wealthy man gestured to Ai Zi, and Ai Zi said:

"Does your son know where the rice comes from?"

The young master said in a voice like singing to a lover, "Rice? I knew it a long time ago: it comes from sacks."

The rice owner was so angry that seven holes were spewing fire when he heard this answer: on the one hand, his own son was so unworthy, losing face; on the other hand, he had already made a bet with Ai Zi that if the son tested foolishly, he would have to compensate ten dan of rice, and vice versa, he would take in ten dan, and now he had to sacrifice it again, how could he not be heartbroken?

Ai Zi, on the other hand, clapped his hands and shouted, "How is it?"

The wealthy man stomped his feet and spat at his son, "Little beast, you're so stupid! Rice grows out of the fields itself!"

Ai Zi almost fell down laughing, thinking, "Like father, like son. This old man thinks that rice grows out of itself, so he desperately raises the price of rice to make a profit, forgetting the poor in the back of his mind."

### Purple – A Symbol of Hope

— Fang Xiaolan

Life is colorless, terrible years. But people say spring is coming. Looking out the window, it's gloomy. Where is the color of spring? I think I'm sick. So I walked into a world of color. I went from the desert to the garden, my eyes lost their direction, and the fluctuations of color made me dizzy. Finally, I picked up a piece of purple, and I returned to the desolate desert.

In the morning, a bunch of purple flowers were planted in a vase on the desk, and there was sunshine jumping between the window frames. It was a happy day. I was a little confused: was it a dream or reality? Where did the flowers come from? A piece of purple, seemed familiar, but vaguely unable to remember.

"Purple - said to be a symbol of hope. Friends, have hope." One day, I and my friends depicted dreams, painted them too beautifully, almost unable to find reality. I said I have hope. Yes, we have hope.

Suppose, once we lose tomorrow and just despairingly wander in today, how terrible will life become? Living in today, we can let go of yesterday, but how can we not have tomorrow?

I took the flowers out of the vase. I wanted to share them with my friends. I wanted to tell them that life is purple, and we must have hope.

The sky has changed again, gray, dark, but my mood no longer changes; a piece of purple, I will always see a piece of purple. Putting on a raincoat and wearing a hat, I'm going outside to distribute the purple flowers.

### Sharing the Boat in Storms

— He Jia Zhi

(2) Sorrow and Joy

Wei Cheng absolutely trusted his aunt's words. He was willing to do anything he had been unwilling to do before. In the dim light, he saw the tea table, candle holder, incense burner, and matches. He lit the candles and incense, the candlelight flickering and the smoke curling upwards. He knelt down on the red felt rug with sincere trepidation. After kneeling and kowtowing three times, he did not get up, his lips slightly fluttering, and clear tears fell from his eyes again. Madam Ye Er, standing to the side, said, "Child, get up, it's cold, it's no joke to catch a cold. You are so pious, and we are just as pious. Your mother will surely turn danger into safety. Get up, get up." Wei Cheng grasped his right hand with his left, and his left hand with his right; he was almost helped up by Madam Ye Er. Madam Ye Er wanted to send Wei Cheng to his bedroom to rest, not expecting him to sleep soundly, but just to have him doze for a while. But Wei Cheng was unwilling to go there.

Everyone was concerned about Lin Shaobang's words that Madam Ye's lifespan would not last until dawn. Therefore, dawn was a difficult hurdle. Some people were thinking that once dawn passed, the difficult hurdle would be overcome and she would get better. First, they heard the rooster crow, and then they saw the east turning white. Li Youxie rubbed his eyelids and asked what time it was. Upon asking, they learned that Madam Ye: had not changed much, and everyone's faces showed joy. Second Aunt said, "Doctors are like ghosts and gods, you can't not believe them, but you can't completely believe them. Huang the Madman said this and that, and Lin the Western doctor said this and that, and they scared people out of their wits." First Aunt chimed in, "Isn't that right?"

After dawn, A Xing was again preparing to set off on foot to invite the doctor, but he did not return for a long time. Mother He was wringing hot towels to wipe everyone's faces. Madam Ye Er insisted on forcing Wei Cheng to go to sleep. Wei Cheng's will was somewhat active. He walked to the bedside and called out "Mother". Unexpectedly, Madam Ye suddenly regained consciousness, her tongue stiffened, and she called for her child, called for Wei Cheng. (30)
