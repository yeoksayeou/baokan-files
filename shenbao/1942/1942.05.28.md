### Both Sides of the Donets River: Germany Deploys Artillery Positions; Tank Battle in the Kharkiv Region Unprecedented in Scale

Havas News Agency, Bucharest, May 16th: Military sources here state that the fighting around Izyum and Lozova in the Kharkiv area has reached its peak, with hand-to-hand combat occurring in several places. However, all Soviet attempts to break through German lines have failed. The German High Command has deployed artillery positions on both sides of the Donets River and concentrated armored units to repel enemy forces. Military operations south of Kharkiv have now come to a temporary halt, with heavy losses on both sides, although no exact figures are available. A Soviet pocket that was approximately 80 miles deep on May 20th has now shrunk to 10 miles. The deepest point of Soviet penetration was west of Mykhailivka, at the intersection of the Kharkiv-Chaplyne railway and the Poltava-Sloviansk railway. According to unconfirmed reports, the Kharkiv-Chaplyne railway line is still in German hands. The Soviet-held area south of Kharkiv is now limited to the area along the Krasnohrad-Sloviansk railway. If this information is accurate, the Soviet Union has lost the city of Lozova, which it had recaptured several months ago. Military observers here also note that the battle between General Bock's German forces in the south and Timoshenko's forces is the fourth such encounter. In the previous three, the Soviet forces were defeated due to encirclement. General Bock is again using the same strategy, and Timoshenko is repeating his mistakes, resulting in another defeat. Modern warfare is about speed, but the Soviet Union has never been able to copy Germany's blitzkrieg tactics to fully utilize its combat power. This is the main reason for its defeat. If the Soviet forces had immediately advanced towards Krasnohrad after occupying Lozova, the situation would be different today. At the beginning of this year, when the Soviet forces launched a landing in Crimea, they also lost the opportunity due to slow action, failing to put the southern Soviet forces in a favorable position. In short, the Battle of Kharkiv is a prelude to the German offensive, and the German High Command has already found the best tactics to deal with the Soviet Union.

Havas News Agency, Rome, May 26th: The Roman People's Daily recently published a report from a war correspondent in the Kharkiv area who said, "I have witnessed the great tank battle in the Kharkiv area, the scale of which is unprecedented. The roads leading to the front lines are filled with vehicles going back and forth. Supply convoys carrying food and ammunition are heading to the front lines, while soldiers from the front lines are being transferred to the rear for rest. Fierce fighting has been going on in the area for 12 days. Three Soviet giant tanks attempted to destroy an important railway junction, but they were destroyed by German anti-tank guns and are still overturned on the battlefield. From my observation post in [unknown] I can see the city of Kharkiv looking like a great warship damaged by artillery fire. It is fragmented and covered in fire. Tall buildings are almost entirely destroyed by artillery fire. In short, General Timoshenko's artillery and air force have been bombing the city of Kharkiv day and night, but his tank and other army units have not been able to directly attack the city."

Reuters News Agency, London, May 27th: Regarding Kharkiv, the German communiqué last night stated that they were annihilating the surrounded Soviet forces. The Soviet communiqué stated that they had consolidated their positions. The two communiqués are listed below. The Soviet communiqué at noon today stated that in the Kharkiv area, our forces consolidated the positions they had occupied last night. In the Izyum and Barvenkovo areas, our forces were engaged in fierce fighting with German tank units and infantry. There were no major incidents on other fronts. The communiqué of the German High Command stated that the annihilation of the surrounded Soviet forces south of Kharkiv is progressing rapidly. After the failed breakout attempts, Soviet resistance has collapsed.

Havas News Agency, Moscow, May 26th: The official communiqué released tonight stated that our forces on the Kharkiv front have withdrawn to new positions. German forces in the Izyum and Barvenkovo areas, under the cover of large tank units, attempted a fierce offensive, but they were repelled by our forces.

Haitong News Agency, German Führer Headquarters, May 27th: The German war report this afternoon stated that the surrounded Soviet forces south of Kharkiv are being rapidly annihilated. The enemy has repeatedly attempted to break out without success, and their resistance has been destroyed. General Podlas, commander of the Soviet 57th Army, and his chief of staff committed suicide in a critical situation. Our forces in the central and northern sectors continue to advance and win victories. Two large enemy merchant ships in the port of Murmansk were bombed and caught fire.

Reuters News Agency, Stockholm, May 27th: According to Soviet sources here, Soviet forces on the Izyum-Barvenkovo front have broken through the flanks of the German wedge-shaped positions, cutting off the lines of communication between the leading units of the main German offensive and the rear.

### Soviet Ambassador Litvinov Visits Hull for Lengthy Talks

Discussing the issue of material transport to the Soviet Union

Reuters News Agency, Washington, May 27th: Soviet Ambassador to the United States Litvinov visited the State Department yesterday morning at the invitation of US Secretary of State Hull. Litvinov then stated that Hull had given him a "document", but did not disclose the nature of the document.

Havas News Agency, Washington, May 26th: Secretary of State Hull held a two-hour meeting with Soviet Ambassador Litvinov this morning. Afterwards, the Soviet ambassador told reporters that Secretary of State Hull had handed over a "document". It is believed that the "document" is an adjustment plan to coordinate the implementation steps of the current US-Soviet lend-lease agreement with similar agreements that the United States has established with other countries.

Haitong News Agency, Lisbon, May 27th: News from Washington states that Soviet Ambassador to the United States Litvinov held talks with US Secretary of State Hull yesterday for 40 minutes. Political circles in Washington attach great importance to this matter. Litvinov told reporters that he met with Hull at his invitation. A semi-official statement said that the issue of transporting lend-lease materials to the Soviet Union was discussed at the time. It is expected that the Soviet military's launch of a spring offensive was also a topic of discussion.

Draft Content of US-Soviet Agreement

Reuters News Agency, Washington, May 26th: The proposed draft agreement between the Soviet and American governments has been sent to the Soviet government by Soviet Ambassador Litvinov today. It is understood that the draft proposed by the United States is similar in some respects to the agreement established between the United States and Britain this year. The US-Soviet agreement will place the Soviet Union on an equal footing with Britain in terms of US aid, and will give the Soviet Union economic benefits. The Soviet Union can import military supplies and other goods from the United States without having to repay the loans through borrowing or other financial agreements.

Reuters News Agency, Washington, May 27th: President Roosevelt said at a press conference yesterday morning that the "Lend-Lease Act Agreement" given to Soviet Ambassador Litvinov by Secretary of State Hull was only a draft, and its content was almost the same as the Lend-Lease Act agreements concluded by the United States with Britain and other Allied countries. When a reporter asked whether the US-Soviet agreement also involved the post-war commercial relations between the two countries, Roosevelt replied that this agreement was no different from those concluded by the United States with other countries. President Roosevelt spoke about the US military delegation's trip to London, saying that this was another manifestation of the Allied countries' joint operations. When asked whether the arrival of the US military delegation in Britain was related to the recent demands to open a second European battlefield, the president smiled and said, "Maybe it is, maybe it isn't."

Rumors that the United States has proposed to conclude a mutual assistance treaty with Turkey have arisen from this. However, American officials here say that the United States does not consider its aid to Turkey to be in the nature of a mutual assistance treaty. The friendship between the United States and Turkey is indeed strong, but Turkey's benefits from the lend-lease act are no different from those of other countries. Therefore, in the future, the United States has no other demands except to continue shipping military supplies to Turkey according to the agreement.

### Three Factories in Russia Ablaze; Losses Amount to 60 Million Rubles

Moscow, 26th (Havas): Today, a day marred by misfortune, important factories in widely separated parts of the country were successively ravaged by fire.

### The Course of Mediterranean Warfare: Cunningham Recounts Three Periods Before His Departure to the U.S.

London, 26th (Havas): Admiral Cunningham, former commander of the British Mediterranean Fleet, has been appointed by the government as a military attaché to the U.S. and will soon leave for his new post. He recently delivered a radio broadcast here, recounting the course of the Mediterranean warfare. He stated that the Mediterranean war can be divided into three periods. The first period lasted from the outbreak of the European War until Italy's entry. During this time, the situation in the Mediterranean was calm, and the actions of the British Navy were limited to blockading enemy trade. Therefore, most of the Mediterranean Fleet was transferred elsewhere, with only a few old cruisers left for patrol duty. When the German army attacked France, the Allied forces dispatched additional warships through the Strait of Sicily and along the coast of Tunisia to strengthen the Mediterranean defenses. At that time, the majority of the Mediterranean Fleet was composed of French warships, which were highly motivated and fought bravely. The second period was when Germany reinforced the Mediterranean. During this period, the British forces, weakened in strength, adopted a defensive posture. Later, the Germans deployed a large number of aircraft to Italy, gaining air superiority. They also reinforced Libya to fully utilize the land as a base. During this period, both sides bombed each other's bases and communication lines. This marked the third period, and the situation in the Mediterranean remains in this stage. However, British strength has increased, and its position has become more stable.

### Disagreement Within the British Labour Party

London, 26th (Havas): The 41st Annual Conference of the British Labour Party was held yesterday at the Central Hall of Parliament. 724 delegates from 67 trade unions attended. It is anticipated that the conference will make important decisions, as the delegates aim to determine the political stance of the 2.5 million workers in various industries. It is estimated that the discussion of this matter will take three days. During the first meeting yesterday, the delegates held differing opinions on several important issues, particularly regarding the attitude the Labour Party should adopt toward the government in the current war. Some delegates argued that the Labour Party's concessions in 1940 to join the Churchill cabinet and form a united national government were aimed at ensuring an early British victory. However, as things stand now, the combat situation is not sufficient to compensate for the sacrifices made by the Labour Party. Although the Labour Party's Executive Committee holds twenty seats in the current cabinet, its position is very delicate. Regardless of the government's decisions and actions, Labour Party cabinet members must be accountable to the Labour Party. However, in practice, they have little power to influence all the cabinet's resolutions. Some delegates proposed a motion demanding the government to socialize the arms industry. If the government disagreed, the Labour Party should act freely. However, this motion failed to gain the support of the majority of the delegates and was rejected. In addition, the conference passed two resolutions yesterday. They requested the government to adjust the various modes of transportation in Britain and place them under government control. They also requested the government not to restore the free competition system and disorganized social structure after the war.

### Special Report on Near Eastern Countries

2.  A General Survey of Turkey (1)

Since the Great War of 1914, there have been three countries whose transformations have been the most dramatic. These have caused people of all nations around the world, regardless of size or power, to feel a sense of shock and dismay. These are Germany, the Soviet Union, and Turkey. Among these, the transformation of Turkey has been the most ear-splitting and mind-numbing, and the purity and singleness of purpose of its revitalizing spirit are most worthy of emulation by weaker nations. Here, we should introduce Turkey to you for your reference.

The Origin of the Nickname "The Sick Man of Europe"

From Chinese history, we can easily find a strange name—the Turkic people (突厥). Anyone who has read Chinese history is probably not unfamiliar with this name. It is said that this race originated from the mixed barbarians (雜胡) of Pingliang. When Cao Cao led his northern expedition to Pingliang, some of these barbarians migrated to the foot of the Altai Mountains, which is the origin of the Turkic people. Later, driven out by the Uyghurs (回紇), some of the Turkic people migrated again to the areas of Arabia and Asia Minor. In the Arabian area, the most notable were the Seljuks (塞爾柱); in Asia Minor, it was the Ottoman (奧托曼) clan, who later founded the Turkish Empire. Both of these Turkic branches had their moment in world history. The Seljuks once fought against seven "Crusades," fighting and killing for almost a hundred years. For a branch of a race to fight against the allied forces of four or five countries and consistently remain on the winning side is no easy feat. At the end of the thirteenth century, an Ottoman came from Asia Minor, and after some effort, became the founding emperor of Turkey. Seeing this episode in history is enough to dispel some of the frustration in our hearts, isn't it?

After founding the country, the Ottomans called themselves Sultan (蘇丹), which is the title for the great emperor of a Muslim country. From this great emperor onwards, a succession of brilliant and capable figures emerged over six to seven hundred years, transforming a small grassland tribe into a great nation that dominated the three continents of Asia, Europe, and Africa. This is something that the mixed barbarians of Pingliang, who were driven away by Cao Cao, would never have dreamed of.

There is no need to detail the piecemeal battles and gradual expansion; let us just say what the situation of Turkey was in the middle of the sixteenth century. Taking everything into account, Turkey at that time could be said to possess North Africa, such as present-day French Algeria, Tunisia, Tripoli, and Egypt; in Asia, it had Arabia, Palestine, Syria, Transjordan, Iraq, and the Transcaucasus; and in Europe, it had the entire Balkan Peninsula, the northern shore of the Black Sea, and the middle reaches of the Danube. At that time, the Black Sea, the Mediterranean Sea, the Red Sea, and the Aegean Sea could be said to be within the sphere of Turkish influence. The glorious expansion of a nation reached its peak at this time. It must be understood that the initial capital for such a large territory was merely five hundred households.

As the saying goes, "When the sun reaches its zenith, it declines; when the moon is full, it wanes." This is a profound truth. Despite Turkey's success in building such a great enterprise with small capital, it was also in the mid-sixteenth century that a series of misfortunes began. First, Venice and Austria caused trouble. The Ottoman Empire, having reached its peak and begun to decline, had to cede some territory and retreat to southeastern Europe. In the eighteenth century, Russia produced a wise ruler, Peter the Great, who coveted Constantinople, which Turkey had seized from the Eastern Roman Empire. This was the choke point of the Black Sea, so he launched a large-scale southern invasion. As a result, Turkey became somewhat unable to resist, causing the once powerful and domineering empire to decline daily and become helpless. At this time, Turkey was not only militarily weak and its army dispirited, but its internal affairs were also extremely corrupt, with heavy taxes and the people living in misery. Imagine such a vast land, with more than twenty different ethnic groups, each with their own languages and scripts, and different religions. Once the ruler showed signs of collapse, such a combination would naturally lead to a worsening situation and a gradual decline.

Ever since Russia seized Crimea in 1792, the Ottoman Empire began to disintegrate. Serbia and Greece then successively declared independence. In 1875, the Balkans first revolted, and Egypt seceded. As a result, England, France, Russia, Austria, and Italy were constantly "having tea" and "bargaining" with this aging empire in Constantinople, their intentions menacing, as if they were about to carve it up. At this time, there was nothing to say, and the nickname "the sick man of Europe" was easily pinned on Turkey. Until the eve of the outbreak of the Second Balkan War in 1912, Turkey lived a life of sighs and lamentations, never raising its head.

### Subletting Licenses Office No. 4 Is Now Closed; No Extension After the End of This Month; Personnel Have Been Dispatched to Various Districts for Investigation

Since the Shanghai Municipal Council's subletting licenses began to be issued on April 1st, the following locations were designated: Central District, Room 506, Revenue Division, Shanghai Municipal Council Building; Western District, 378 Avenue Road, 35 Robison Road, 160 Macgregor Road, 1461 Sinza Road, and Jessfield Road; Northern District, 270 North Fujian Road, 130 Haines Road; Eastern District, 132 Chusan Road, 558 Chapoo Road. They were divided into four districts to make it convenient for sublessors to apply nearby. However, by the end of April, only over 30,000 licenses had been issued, which did not match the total of over 60,000 application forms taken. It was inferred that many people had not obtained licenses. Therefore, starting May 1st, an additional half-month extension was granted. However, during the extension period, the number of applicants was still not enthusiastic. Therefore, another half-month extension was granted until the end of this month. During this final extension, many sublessors continued to wait and see. Therefore, the Subletting Housing Management Office has dispatched personnel to the central, western, northern, and eastern districts to conduct strict investigations. Any cases of subletting remaining properties without obtaining a license will be prosecuted and punished after the extension period expires. It is understood that after the final extension at the end of this month, there will be no further extensions. The western district offices on Jessfield Road, Macgregor Road, and Avenue Road, and the northern district office on North Fujian Road, will be closed in order. Therefore, sublessors who have not obtained a license should not let the last four days of the licensing opportunity pass, lest they bring trouble upon themselves.

### Chinese Evacuation Committee Intensifies Evacuation Work by Removing Women

The Shanghai Municipal Council's Chinese Evacuation Committee has evacuated over 50,000 people in the two months since it began handling population evacuations. Details were reported in yesterday's newspaper. The committee's future plans will focus on removing women and children. Supplementary details are provided below. It is necessary to explain the future work situation, especially after the discount coupons were discontinued on May 1st. The committee's work has entered a new stage. Continued Issuance of Return Home Permits: Although the half-price travel discount has been cancelled since May 1st, evacuation work will continue. Although the number of evacuees seems large, it pales in comparison to the total population of the city. Furthermore, given the current situation, living expenses are likely to rise rather than fall. Therefore, citizens returning to their hometowns will continue to do so. To facilitate the permit application process, the committee will continue to entrust various organizations, such as hometown associations, to issue return home permits.

Application for Travel Discounts: Although travel discount coupons have been cancelled, the hardships of poor citizens are taken into account. With the agreement of all relevant parties, groups of 200 or more people preparing to return home can apply to the committee for half-price discounts. Upon receiving the application, it will be approved.

Liaison for Transportation: In addition to applying for half-price discounts, groups of citizens being evacuated to distant and inconvenient destinations can be assisted by the committee in contacting relevant parties for ships to facilitate evacuation work.

Issuance of Temporary Permits: The return home permits issued by the committee can only be used for leaving Shanghai and cannot be used to return to Shanghai. However, some citizens may need to return to their hometowns for important matters or to accompany family members leaving Shanghai and need to return to Shanghai in a short period. To alleviate this difficulty, a temporary permit is issued separately by the committee and the International High Command.

Intensifying Evacuation Work: The work of the past three months can only be described as the beginning of evacuation work and cannot be considered the completion of evacuation work. According to statistics, the industrial and commercial sectors account for 77.5% of evacuees, while other items (including women and children, and the unemployed) account for only 20.1%. It is evident that the past three months focused on the evacuation of the unemployed. In the future, the focus should be on the evacuation of the non-essential unemployed women and children in Shanghai to achieve the ultimate goal of evacuation work. It is planned to strengthen publicity work and encourage citizens who do not need to stay in Shanghai to evacuate quickly.

### Rice Shops in Both Concessions to Sell Popular Rice from Today at 7.6 Yuan per Half Sheng; Applications for Closing Rice Shops to Be Announced Early Next Month

Yesterday, rice shops in both concessions continued to request rice certificates from the Shanghai Municipal Council's Rice Management Committee. The soft price of rice in packages was changed to 576 yuan. The rice purchased yesterday will be supplied for sale next week. Rice shops will continue to sell rice today at a retail price of 7.6 yuan per half sheng. Since the total number is over 10,000 bags, the supply situation will be widespread.

Rice shops in both concessions obtained transportation permits on Sunday to extract rice from the Swire, Mitsubishi, and Zhejiang Xingye warehouses. Extraction continued the day before yesterday and was completed yesterday to supply for sale this Sunday. The rice warehouses designated the day before yesterday continue to be Swire, Mitsubishi, and Zhejiang Xingye. The imported rice from these warehouses has already been sold out.

The Shanghai Municipal Council's Rice Management Committee announced that the deadline for allowing closed rice shops to apply for resumption of business in writing has passed. The list of rice shops approved for resumption of business is expected to be announced by the Rice Management Committee early next month. After paying the deposit and being issued a business license for this year, they can begin to resume business. However, the number of rice shops approved for resumption of business is still unknown at this time.

### The Weather Was Dark This Morning in Shanghai; People Could Not Be Recognized Within a Short Distance; All Vehicles Had to Turn on Their Lights

The weather in Shanghai was suddenly and drastically changed by the low pressure originating from the Yangtze River basin. There were thunderstorms and torrential rain. The wind howled all night before, and the weather was extremely bad. From 9:00 AM to 9:20 AM yesterday, dark clouds gathered, and a dark phenomenon suddenly appeared. People could hardly be recognized within a short distance. Trams and cars turned on their lights to avoid collisions. Such a dark state was rare. Due to the rain and wind, the tide of the Paichiang River rose sharply. Before 3:00 AM yesterday morning, the tide of the Paichiang River inundated the riverbank, and the low-lying roads were flooded with water.

### Transportation Company Manager Arrested for Embezzling Passengers and Goods

Wu Mingyang, a 51-year-old man from Anhui and manager of the Antrip Travel Agency at 39 Avenue Edward VII, was entrusted by Ma Yan, a merchant residing at 32 Rue Doumer, in February of this year to transport 100 boxes of carbon paper (worth over 5,000 yuan) to Hangzhou. Ma paid Wu a handling fee of 480 yuan, and Wu issued a receipt signed by himself. However, Wu only delivered eight boxes of carbon paper, and the rest were embezzled. After Ma repeatedly urged him without success, Ma had no choice but to complain to the French Concession authorities. An officer was dispatched to summon Wu, but he avoided meeting. Yesterday, Ma Yan led an investigator to point out Wu, who was then brought to justice for investigation.

### Japanese Army and Navy Authorities Decide on Measures to Handle the Four Banks; Central and China Farmers Banks to Remain Closed; China and Communications Banks to Be Reorganized and Reopened

According to Domei, after the Japanese army entered the concessions, they closed the Central, China, Communications, and Farmers banks and sent inspectors to investigate. Specific measures have now been decided. Yesterday (the 27th), the highest commanders of the Japanese army and navy in Shanghai issued a proclamation deciding on the general principles for handling the four banks. The Central and China Farmers banks will remain closed and liquidated according to separate guidelines. The China and Communications banks will be appropriately reorganized and allowed to reopen. The specific plan for reopening

### Theft Occurs at Russian Catholic Church Late at Night; Many Gold and Silver Ornaments on Icons Removed; Some of the Stolen Goods Not Carried Away Were Found

According to the English-language Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury, the Russian Catholic Church at 235 Rue Boppe in the French Concession was broken into and looted by thieves late at night on the 24th of this month. The gold and silver parts of the icons were removed, and the wine used for Holy Communion was stolen and drunk. Afterwards, some of the stolen items were found buried in a neighboring garden. When this news was released yesterday, the Russian community in Shanghai expressed shock. According to investigations by the French Concession authorities, the thieves apparently hid in the bushes in the church square on Sunday night, waited for others to leave, and then broke into the building through a window. They acted in a leisurely manner, and all parts of the church were vandalized. The altar was broken, and the silver wreaths on the icons were removed. A gold Christ figure was removed from a silver cross. A treasure of the church, a piece of the true cross given by the Roman Church, was also missing. In addition, various gold and silver utensils were stolen. The thieves also found the wine used for Holy Communion and drank heavily on the spot, spilling a lot on the ground. Later, the church leader, Father Fedor, discovered the theft and reported it to the French police. Investigators were dispatched to investigate and found some of the stolen goods in a neighboring garden, presumably temporarily buried because they could not be carried away.

### Columbia Road: A Glimpse of the Christian Refugee Children's Home - Sheltering a Total of Forty-Eight Suffering Children, Completely Ruralizing Their Lives Away from the City

The Christian Refugee Children's Home on Jiangjia Lane, Columbia Road in this city has been established for two years. It shelters displaced refugee children. The initial organizer was Miss Main, an American missionary. When American nationals evacuated from Shanghai this spring, the operation was taken over by local church members Li Baiqiang, Huang Lanyu, Xu Shaodi, and others who established a board of directors to continue its maintenance.

Mixed Vegetable Garden

The Christian Refugee Children's Home is located at the end of Columbia Road in a place called Jiangjia Hui, far from the bustling city, presenting a completely rural scene. At the entrance of Jiangjia Lane, a stone bridge spans a river pond. Crossing the bridge leads directly to the home, with beautiful scenery. The site occupies two and a half acres. In the center is a row of seven single-story houses, each divided into two, making fourteen rooms. The area around the single-story houses is spacious, with a mixed vegetable garden.

Home Facilities

The central single-story houses contain classrooms, bedrooms, bathrooms, dining rooms, and so on. The bedrooms occupy two large rooms, one for boys and one for girls. The girls' bedroom has ten bunk beds, each divided into two levels, accommodating twenty people. The boys' bedroom has twelve beds, accommodating twenty-four people, and there are also two iron beds, accommodating five or six people. Each bunk is neatly furnished with clean cotton bedding. At the north end of the bedrooms, there are wooden shelf racks for the refugee children to place their washbasins and toiletries. Each person is assigned a number, creating an orderly arrangement.

Refugee Children's Origins

The home has accommodated up to fifty refugee children at its peak. Recently, several have been taken away by family members due to the departure of metal industries from Shanghai. Currently, there are still forty-eight children being cared for. The statistics of their origins are as follows: Shaoxing nine, Ningbo seven, Northern Jiangsu eight, Shandong three, Anhui four, Shanghai three, Fujian four, Guangdong two, Nanjing one, others seven. The oldest is sixteen years old, the youngest seven years old. The director Ms. Zhao Aiguang (from Nanjing) and the teacher Ms. Chen Shaojing (from Anhui) are responsible for their management and education.

Daily Life

The daily life of the refugee children is as follows: waking up at 6:00 AM, washing, tidying up the bedrooms, doing morning prayers, and then having breakfast. After breakfast, older boys go to the garden to hoe, cultivate, or plant vegetables. At 9:00 AM, they attend classes or engage in other extracurricular activities. At 12:00 PM, they have lunch. In the afternoon, they continue with classes as usual. At 5:30 PM, they have dinner. However, all three meals consist of thin porridge, mixed with vegetables picked from the garden. Sometimes, plain white porridge is served, accompanied by self-grown broad beans and other side dishes, resembling the life of a farming family, with a unique flavor.

Thorough Nurturing

Every Saturday afternoon, classes are suspended for the refugee children to take baths. Water is taken from the well in the garden, heated, and used. On Sundays, the director leads them to nearby churches for worship. Therefore, their lives are completely collectivized. The director is like a parent, and the teachers are like nannies, creating a harmonious and joyful atmosphere.

Financial Difficulties

However, the most troubling issue for the home's organizers is the financial problem. Because the home has neither a foundation nor regular funding, monthly expenses rely entirely on the board of directors' fundraising, especially for food. Even with thin porridge for three meals, it still requires four bags of rice per month, costing 1,600 yuan. If this continues, it will not only be difficult to sustain but also make it harder to realize plans to expand the accommodation of suffering children. Therefore, they earnestly hope that benevolent individuals will offer assistance and welcome visits to the home. The home's mailing address is c/o Mr. Ji Baiqiang, 422 Hankou Road, or c/o Mr. Xu Shaoshan, 125 Hankou Road.

### Paper Store Robbery

Hongxing Paper Store at No. 23, Lane 727 (i.e., Taian Lane), North Shanxi Road, Tiantong Road, was robbed at 9:00 PM on the 26th (the day before yesterday). The store had closed, and two trainees were guarding the entrance. Unexpectedly, around 10:00 PM, two robbers knocked on the door. The trainees inside asked who it was. The robbers outside falsely claimed to be members of the self-defense corps, saying they needed to borrow the telephone for urgent business. The trainees believed them and opened the door. The two robbers rushed in, closed the door tightly, and one robber guarded it. At this time, the trainees realized they were not dealing with good people and refused to let the robbers enter the store. The robbers then took out a pistol, threatened them into silence, and used ropes to tie up the two trainees, stuffing their mouths with cotton. The two robbers then searched the premises and stole 1,500 yuan in legal tender from the drawer before fleeing. It was not until yesterday morning when the store manager arrived that the robbery was discovered. He immediately reported it to the police, who sent detectives to investigate and pursue the case.

### Swindlers - Using the Pretext of Business Partnership to Deceitfully Obtain Wealth

Ying Liangqin, a salesman at the Meixin Printing House on Tiantong Road, was introduced to Xu Zhiping from Shaoxing. It was found that Xu was a member of a swindling gang, specializing in deceiving and acquiring wealth. After getting acquainted with Ying, they immediately met. In mid-May, Xu claimed that a certain person on Kangti Road in the French Concession had 1,000 dozens of socks, valued at 60,000 yuan, urgently wanting to sell them at a low price. He asked Ying to invest in a partnership, with each share being 10,000 yuan. Ying agreed and arranged to meet at Room 525, China Hotel on Guizhou Road, on the afternoon of the 19th of this month to hand over the money. When Ying arrived with 3,000 yuan (including a 2,000 yuan check from the Continental Bank) at the China Hotel, there were four other people in the room besides Xu: Xu Jinlin, Jin Xigen, Dai Yansheng, and Yu Asi. Xu Zhiping then said that the owner of the socks had not yet arrived, and to kill time, he enticed Ying to gamble (press treasure), promoting Ying as the dealer, claiming he could guarantee wins. At the same time, these people took out a rattan basket, revealing that it was filled with banknotes, approximately tens of thousands of yuan (except for the top and bottom notes being genuine, the rest were made of newsprint). Ying believed it to be true and joined the game as the dealer. Unexpectedly, he lost every bet, and within half an hour, the 3,000 yuan in legal tender was completely lost. Ying then realized he had been deceived and reported it to the General Police Station. Chinese detective Xian Chengming went and brought Xu and the other five people, along with gambling tools and fake notes, to the police station. A 2,000 yuan Continental Bank check was found on Jin Xigen, and another 1,000 yuan in cash was taken away by an accomplice named Liu Bangcai. They were ordered to be detained for further investigation.

### Amidst the Serious Food Shortage, Advocate Planting Sweet Potatoes - Written by Yu Jingmei of the Lester Institute

The sweet potato, also known as sweet yam, is commonly called "bai shu" in the north. In the "Compendium of Materia Medica," it is listed under the vegetable section, mainly used to replenish deficiency, benefit energy, strengthen the spleen and stomach, fortify kidney yin, and prolonged consumption is beneficial to health. According to its described functions, it is indeed a harmless and beneficial food. At this time of serious food shortage, various doctrines about this product are collected and introduced to those who study food and care about people's livelihoods for reference. Shape: It is a vegetable plant with slender stems that creep on the ground. Its leaves are oval or heart-shaped with long petioles, arranged alternately. The flowers are fused corollas, shaped like morning glories but smaller in size and purple in color. Its tubers are fleshy and used for food. Taste: Sweet and palatable. Origin: The species originally came from the South Pacific Islands, hence the name "sweet potato." It was first introduced to Guangdong and Fujian, and now it is found everywhere. Various Descriptions in Old Books: "Grass Records of the South" states, "It is produced in Zhuyai. The people in the sea do not farm, but dig and plant sweet potatoes. They harvest in autumn, steam and dry them, cutting them into grain-like pieces. They store them in barns as food rations. This is called 'sweet potato grain.' Generally, among southerners with gray hair, there are very few, only one or two out of a hundred. However, people in the sea live over a hundred years because they do not eat grains but eat sweet potatoes." "Records of Strange Things" states, "Sweet potatoes come from Jiaoguang. Southern families plant them in February and harvest them in October. Their roots are similar to taro, and some are very large, the largest being like goose eggs, and the smallest like chicken eggs. After peeling off the purple skin, the flesh is as white as fat. Southerners consider it as grain and fruit. Su Dongpo once said that Hainan uses sweet potatoes as grain, about one-sixteenth of the amount of rice. Now, it is the same in northern Hainan." Xu Xuanhu said that sweet potatoes have thirteen advantages: 1. One mu yields dozens of shi; 2. Its white color and sweet taste are particularly outstanding among all soils; 3. It benefits people, with the same function as taro; 4. It spreads everywhere, propagated by cutting stems; one stem this year can plant hundreds of mu next year; 5. Its branches and leaves cling to the ground, and the nodes grow roots, so wind and rain cannot damage it; 6. It can be used as grain, so famine years cannot harm it; 7. It can supply border areas; 8. It can be used to make wine; 9. It can be stored for a long time, and when ground, it can be made into cakes, better than sugar and honey; 10. It can be eaten raw or cooked; 11. It requires less land and yields more benefits, and it is easy to irrigate; 12. It is planted in spring and summer, and harvested in early winter. Its branches and leaves are very lush, and grass cannot grow, but it requires loose soil and does not require plowing, without hindering agricultural work; 13. Its roots are deep in the soil, and even if the seedlings are eaten to the end, they can still grow, and locusts cannot do anything about it. Components: The following table shows the percentage of sweet potato components analyzed using scientific methods by a nutrition expert: Water 72.25, Protein 1.08, Fat 0.19, Carbohydrates 21.49, Fiber 1.37, Calories 94, Ash 0.62, Phosphorus 0.06, Iron 0.0006, Potassium 0.194, Vitamins A, B, C, D are all abundant. This table is based on the experimental data in the book "Foods of Shanghai" and is provided for readers' reference. (Note: The book "Foods of Shanghai" is written by a certain nutrition expert.) Planting Method: Plant sweet potatoes in high sandy land, raising ridges more than a foot high, and planting on the ridges. Plow deeply before the end of the year and fertilize with manure. Plant after the vernal equinox. Cut the sweet potato roots into three or four-inch lengths, cover them with soil half an inch deep. Space each plant seven or eight feet vertically and two or three feet horizontally. When the vines have grown vigorously and the seedlings are a zhang long, leave two feet as old roots, and cut the remaining three leaves into sections, inserting them into the soil. Plant each seedling one foot apart, approximately two-thirds of the seedling should be buried in the soil, and one-third should be exposed, so that it can grow again. Cut and plant as it grows, and the spread is no different from the original planting. When planting sweet potatoes, they must be planted upright; if planted upside down, they will not grow. Knots above the soil will grow branches, and knots below the soil will grow tubers. Approximately each knot grows roots, and then cut them off at their connection points, so that each forms roots and seedlings. Each knot can yield three to five tubers. All vines that have spread everywhere and cannot be contained are called "wandering vines" and should be pruned. When digging the roots, the rolled vines can all be used to feed cattle, sheep, and pigs, or dried to feed them in winter, which can fatten them. Those planted in February or March require two and a half steps of land per plant, and the tubers will spread. Approximately thirty-six plants are planted per mu. Those planted in April or May require two steps of land, and the tubers will spread. Approximately sixty plants per mu. Those planted in June require one and a half steps of land, and the tubers will spread, approximately one hundred and six plants per mu. Those planted in July require three feet of land or less, and the tubers will be small. Approximately nine hundred and sixty plants per mu. The density of planting can be adjusted according to the circumstances. Those planted in ridges in September will grow tubers like chopsticks. Consider using them as seeds. This is the Songjiang method.

Overall, based on the above new and old doctrines, sweet potatoes are undoubtedly a beneficial food. In the current situation of severe food shortages, we should advocate planting more of this product, which is also a way to remedy the food shortage.

### Three Orphanages Stage a Play to Raise Funds

The Ciji Children's Home at the intersection of North Zhejiang Road and Qipu Road in Shanghai is jointly operated by the Charity Organization United Disaster Relief Association and the Jisheng Association, sheltering over two hundred poor children. The Jingye Orphanage on Avenue Haig, operated by the Jingye Society, houses over one hundred people, and the Disaster Relief Children's Home on Rue Courbet houses over two hundred people. None of them have foundations and rely entirely on donations. Recently, the cost of living has increased daily, making it difficult to maintain them. Now, prominent philanthropists such as Wen Lanting, Yuan Ludeng, and Huang Jinrong have initiated and invited renowned amateur opera singers Fei Jianlong and Sun Junqing, as well as famous performers Huang Guiqiu, Lin Shusen, and Cao Huilin, to perform a charity performance on the afternoon of the 30th of this month at the Grand Theater. Ticket prices are divided into four types: 20 yuan, 10 yuan, 5 yuan, and 1 yuan. The proceeds from the ticket sales, after deducting expenses, will be allocated to the above three organizations as funding. Shanghai is not lacking in knowledgeable music lovers and philanthropists. Listening to elegant music and planting blessings, they will surely enthusiastically support and contribute to this charitable cause.

### Good News for Addicts

The Chinese Drug Rehabilitation Center at the intersection of Route des Soeurs and Route Massenet is the earliest established and most fully equipped drug rehabilitation hospital in Shanghai. Dr. Jin Xuegao, the director of the hospital, is not only proficient in drug rehabilitation but also has rich experience in internal medicine, pediatrics, and other departments. For all deeply entrenched addictions to opium, heroin, etc., whether smoked or injected, he can achieve the goal of safe and thorough withdrawal. At a time when everything is rising in price and life is difficult, having such a good drug rehabilitation hospital is truly good news for addicts.

### European Director Gao Tianlun Wanders Thousands of Miles to Shanghai (Part 2) - Discovering the Alluring Star Marlene Dietrich and Single-Handedly Handling a Puppet Troupe in Half a Year

Gao Tianlun has a considerable position in the European film industry. His Western puppet troupe has performed several times in this city. Unfortunately, the dialogue and lyrics are all in German, and only a few can appreciate them. It is said that the English script has been translated, and probably next time this novel thing will be performed in English.

Our reporter recently visited this wandering European film director. His residence and the expression when directing the puppet show were seen in yesterday's newspaper. What is recorded here is how he discovered the big star Marlene Dietrich and the struggles after fleeing east:

Discovering Marlene Dietrich

"This is a film Marlene and I co-produced in Saint-Gill - (a famous resort area in southern Austria) in the spring of 1937" - (pictured in yesterday's newspaper). Mr. Gao Tianlun finally found it from a pile of photos. Then, he happily told the story of how he discovered her.

He said that it was about 1925 when he was working at Tobis Sacha Film Co. One time, everyone in the film studio had left, but the boss wanted to make a film that needed a very lively female character. Among the many young women who applied, he found a girl with bright eyes, white teeth, a slender figure, and curly hair, who later became known as the naturally charming and alluring star Ms. Marlene Dietrich.

"What kind of play did she perform in?" I asked.

"Cafe Electrie - Electrical Hotel." He thought for a while and opened the "old account book" from seventeen years ago before he could remember the name.

Marlene Dietrich often played the charming and moving hostess in movies, which shows that it was "a long time coming."

Gao Tianlun gave a "close-up" of the scene when he met Marlene in Saint-Gill. His happy expression is difficult for my clumsy pen to describe.

Twenty-Seven Years of Film Work

In the various actions of smoking, laughing wildly, sighing, and meditating, Gao Tianlun relived his old dream of making films in various parts of Europe. From his conversation, I learned some of his past life:

He was born in Vienna on June 15, 1895, received a considerable education, and is married. He began working in the film industry in 1914. He has been to Berlin, Munich, Prague, Budapest, Brussels, and London, all working in film studios. He fled Vienna in 1939, stayed in Paris for a while, and then went to Manila. He signed a five-year contract with a local Meniver Film Company. That musical romance film "Huling Pagheha" - (meaning the last tears) is said to have sold very well. He left the Philippines and came to Shanghai in mid-June last year. Because of the incident, he had to live a dull life in Shanghai. And that film called "Sunlight," all the preparation plans had to be completely shelved. Gao Tianlun, according to himself, designed, directed, edited, and produced a total of 296 films of all sizes in twenty-seven years.

When Gao Tianlun talked about the filming in Manila, his spirit was very nervous at first. He showed me newspaper reviews, records, head lists, promotional materials, etc., and almost no printed matter did not have the A. Gottlein name. Finally, he turned over the thick three volumes of dialogue scripts of the "Sunlight" play, which took a lot of effort but was completely in vain. The inside was in German, English, and Filipino. There were also complete lists of roles, scene drawings, and set descriptions, all piled high on top of these three huge volumes of scripts. His voice became lower and lower, and his expression became more and more sluggish; it was like the "fade-out" method in movies. Finally, he said weakly to me:

"Sir, it's all over!" (At this point, everyone was silent, only raindrops hitting the glass window)

Struggling in the Loft

"Then you have to think of some way!" I said.

It was as if he woke up again, and both eyes gradually shone again.

"Puppet show," he raised his voice, leaning his upper body on the desk, and said to me face to face.

"In seven or eight months, I personally made those puppets; I also personally trained the puppeteers, teaching them how to move the puppets on stage! We also practiced dialogue in this room all day and night, matching the music. All the sets, props, lighting, curtains, etc. were all made by ourselves. You know, sir, if we left it to others, how could we manage with such a small amount of capital?"

In his five-minute self-report, I felt that this person who had twenty-seven years of film directing experience had erased everything in the past in an uncontrollable environment and with bare hands! He took several large film companies with millions of capital, dozens of stars he had directed, thousands of film practitioners... shrank... shrank... shrank - and became a puppet troupe. He moved the spirit of the big directors like "camera," "cut," etc. from the hundreds of square feet of film studio to the "loft" to direct those eighteen-inch-high rows of puppets. Was he decadent? No. Was he disappointed? No. Was he satisfied? No.

Leaving Gao Tianlun's residence on Avenue Albert, I got these three impressions.

### A Sudden Reversal in Government Bonds

Yesterday's unofficial market for government bonds experienced a sudden reversal. At the opening, bid prices varied, with sellers asking low and buyers bidding high, creating considerable confusion. Initially, Hongxing bought in, followed by Yitai, Runde, and Xinji, who also absorbed a significant amount. However, aggressive selling led to an oversupply on the table, causing repeated fluctuations before ultimately trending sharply downwards. Class C bonds nearly hit the lower limit, but fortunately, Tongshun and Tongkang provided support, preventing it. After two days of hitting the upper limit, this reversal was expected. Long-term thinking still sees no reason to underestimate them; it was merely a temporary release of some floating long positions. Class A bonds broke the 70-yuan mark, with Defu selling small amounts and Tongli continuing to sell broadly. Dechang, Jiufeng, Hengfu, Huichang, Hongda, Tongyuan, Jiufu, and general retail investors all closed out their floating long positions. Buyers included the aforementioned firms, as well as Dazhong, Yongchang, Shunli, Yongkang, and various retail investors, making it extremely lively. The temporary reversal is insignificant; after all, buying now includes two periods' worth of interest. The market results showed a uniform decline of 1.5 to 3.7 yuan, with approximately 3 million yuan in transactions. A simplified table is listed below:

| Category | Highest | Lowest | Closing | Previous Day |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Unified A | 73.00 | 69.50 | 70.00 | Down 3.00 |
| Unified B | 68.50 | 65.00 |  | Down 3.10 |
| Unified C | 68.00 | 64.00 | 64.30 | Down 3.70 |
| Unified D | 61.30 | 99.50 | (illegible) 0.00 | Down 1.00 |
| Unified E | 63.50 | 99.40 | (illegible) 0.00 | Down 3.40 |

### Gold's Rising Momentum Unabated

The unofficial cash gold market first fell and then recovered, briefly dropping below 33,000 yuan. However, the market rebounded from the low, and speculation about the currency revived confidence, leading to brisk trading. The morning opening was 32,500 yuan, 2,350 yuan lower than the previous day's closing price, or 1,500 yuan lower than the afternoon price. A certain gold firm and a certain gang pushed the price up to 33,600 yuan, while securities firms and cash firms sold off. Some retail investors rushed to sell, causing a sharp decline of 1,500 yuan to 32,100 yuan. Another securities firm and a certain gold firm stepped in, and pro-growth rumors also emerged, causing a sharp rebound and strengthening confidence, rising 1,700 yuan to 33,800 yuan. At noon, it was 33,650 yuan, 1,200 yuan lower than the previous day's price, or 350 yuan lower than the afternoon price, with a difference of 1,700 yuan.

Jewelry gold in major Shanghai gold shops is still listed at 3,200 yuan per tael (purchases reduced by 300-400 yuan). Fine silver is listed at 28 yuan, the black market price has fallen to 24 yuan, and silver coins have also fallen to 13-14 yuan each.

### Hong Kong Dollar Around 6 Yuan; More Currency Speculation

In the foreign currency market, British and American gold pounds each rose by one to two yuan, with the former at 700 yuan and the latter at 720 yuan. U.S. dollar notes were 41-42 yuan, and Hong Kong notes were around 6 yuan. These are all spot market prices. Military notes opened in the morning at 12.4 yuan, retreated to 2.2 yuan after opening, then rose to 3.3 yuan, and finally settled at 13.1 yuan. The above-mentioned prices represent an increase of 6 jiao compared to the previous day. Spot prices are around 11 yuan.

The discount rate for drafts was initially (illegible) 150 yuan per thousand, then retreated to 120 yuan, rebounding at noon, and peaking at 170 yuan in the afternoon, ultimately settling at 150 yuan, the same as the previous day's price. The money changers association's overnight rate was 1.5 jiao. The reserve premium rose from 2.23 yuan to 2.6 yuan for drafts, with spot at 2.2 yuan. However, around 3 p.m., there was renewed speculation about currency fluctuations.

### Double Horse Yarn: Prices Fluctuate Frequently Around 10,000 Yuan

After the close, the off-market price rose again to 10,000 yuan.

### Bargains Attract Buyers, Cotton Cloth Rises Again in the Afternoon

Yesterday, the market for factory-made cloth initially fell before rising, with prices for various cloths trending upwards. Holders of Blue Mark goods absorbed bargains without hesitation, a now-common psychology. In the morning, a small number of coarse and fine cloths were released due to tight money, falling by over ten yuan per bolt. The noon closing already showed stabilization. In the afternoon, due to the rise in Eastern cloth, buyers were very active again. 16-pound Globe coarse cloth rose from 380 yuan to 395 yuan, a significant increase of 15 yuan, Flying Hong 385 yuan, 12-pound Globe fine cloth's morning price was as low as 340 yuan, but the evening closing rose to 370 yuan, Fugui 365 yuan, Peach Lady Lin factory orders are divided into new and old orders due to increased storage rent, causing considerable dispute.

The Four Gentlemen flannel red orders peaked at 15.3 yuan, bottomed at 13.65 yuan, and closed at 14.85 yuan, also up 1.5 jiao.

### Corn and Bean Cakes: Re-entered on Dips

The bean market yesterday started flat and then strengthened. Actual sales were scattered, but due to rain, arrivals were limited, so the market showed a slightly brighter outlook. 70 bags of Pudong yellow beans were sold at 305 yuan to 308 yuan ex-warehouse, 10 bags of Chongming sand yellow at 308 yuan delivered, 50 bags of sand red at 268 yuan, 30 bags of Tianjin red beans at 267 yuan, 84 bags of Benniu red beans at 220 yuan ex-warehouse, 50 bags of Nanjing cowpeas at 250 yuan ex-warehouse, 30 bags of Jiangbei field peas at 220 yuan.

The corn market opened yesterday morning continuing the previous day's weakness, with scattered sellers lowering prices to sell off, resulting in a sharp drop of over ten yuan. Subsequently, bargain hunters emerged, and the market recovered slightly, but the final result was still seven or eight yuan lower than before. Four truckloads of Wuhu corn were sold at 188 yuan to 192 yuan delivered.

The bean cake market opened yesterday morning with scarce supply and demand, and the market was stable. Later, rumors spread that there would be slight changes in finance again, causing holders of funds to resume absorbing, and the price turned up three to five yuan. 500 pieces of Wuxi Rongkang overnight cake were sold at 57.5 yuan, Lizi cake May new warehouse orders 1,000 pieces at 83 yuan to 83.5 yuan, Shengji cake June old warehouse orders 2,000 pieces at 69.5 yuan to 73.5 yuan, also July old warehouse orders 1,000 pieces at 73.5 yuan to 74 yuan, also February new warehouse orders 1,500 pieces at 81 yuan to 86 yuan, also March new warehouse orders 500 pieces at 83 yuan, also April new warehouse orders 3,000 pieces at 83 yuan to 88 yuan.

### Bran: One Fall, One Rise

The bran market initially declined ten yuan due to slow sales and sellers releasing inventories. Subsequently, rumors of profitable buying revived the market, resulting in a price that was only one or two yuan lower than before. Sales included 700 bags of Sanxin small package bran, September end warehouse orders, at 140 yuan to 148 yuan.

### Golden Needles Costly

The stock of dried lily flowers in various producing areas is depleted, but according to letters, there is still inventory of Tianjin Datong brand. However, due to the recent sharp reduction in the Tianjin exchange rate, the combined price is rising daily, and the outside expenses are also significant. According to the most recent handling price calculation, the cost must exceed about one-third of the Shanghai market price.

### Sugar Stocks Fluctuate

Yesterday's sugar spot market for raw white sugar was stable, priced at 800 yuan to 810 yuan, slightly lower than the previous day by ten yuan. Sugar stock orders still fluctuated greatly, resulting in little movement. Raw sugar stock opened at 520 yuan, falling to 14 yuan, then rising to 570 yuan midway, then returning to 40 yuan, slightly higher than the previous day by two yuan.

### Bitter Almonds Recover

Bitter almonds previously experienced weak sales, and the value of goods was soft, falling by about 100 yuan. However, with recent dramatic financial changes, prices have rebounded, with varying bids. If calculated based on the Tianjin exchange rate, it is difficult to transfer to Shanghai, so the market is very tight.

### Dried Scallops: Prices Vary Even More

Due to the high discount rate for drafts, the market for dried scallops is rising accordingly. Upon investigation, the production price for shipments to Shanghai varies even more, so selling prices have increased repeatedly. Yesterday's sale orders (drafts) were approximately 5,200 yuan for New Light small dried scallops, 5,000 yuan for medium, and 4,900 yuan for triangular.

### Cigarettes: Easy to Rise, Hard to Fall

The cigarette market trend remains firm. Yesterday, due to financial stability, confidence temporarily stabilized. Overall, trading was quite brisk, because the factory price is still far from the market price, so major national firms are still holding onto their stocks. The morning opening for brands such as Great Britain was 11,500 yuan, temporarily falling significantly, but later rebounding to 13,000 yuan. Old Knife brand 9,000 yuan, Pin Hai brand 7,000 (illegible), Five China brand 5,700 yuan, Little Fairy brand 6,500 yuan. The above prices had slight fluctuations. Japanese cigarettes Golden Gun brand initially were weak, opening at 2,550 yuan, but later bargain hunters absorbed, and the price gradually rose to close at 2,670 yuan. Golden Building brand 3,250 yuan, Red Rose brand 2,030 yuan, All Luck brand (illegible) 900 yuan, Compass brand 2,200 yuan, Golden Mouse brand 3, (illegible) 100 yuan, Beautiful brand 5,800 yuan. The market was quite brisk.

### Daily Necessities Market Calm

The selling price of daily necessities is slightly softer. Because of the recent sharp rise, those who wanted to buy are watching, resulting in a calm market state. The opening prices were 480 yuan per box for Gu Ben soap, 420 yuan for Bai Xiangmao soap, 390 yuan for Huang Xiangmao soap, and 420 yuan for Scissors soap, all about (illegible) 20 yuan lower than the previous day. Matches also trended weak, with Phoenix brand at 6,800 yuan, Beautiful brand at 7,000 yuan, generic brands at 5,200 yuan, and Whiteley candles at (illegible) 90 yuan.

### Longan (6)

— Gao Jianchen

The season for picking longans is approximately after the White Dew solar term. Zhou Liangong's "Minor Chronicles of Fujian" says: "Longan branches are very soft and brittle. When ripe, experienced pickers are hired, fearing that they will eat too much. They are hired with the agreement: 'Sing without stopping. If you stop, you will not be paid.' The leaves are lush, people sit in the green shade, singing softly up and down continuously, which is quite pleasing to hear from afar. The locals call it 'singing longans.'" What a poetic and rustic scene this is! When picking, a small amount of stems and leaves must be attached for long-term storage. As for the method of roasting, the "Complete Treatise on Agriculture" says: "After picking, soak them in plum (illegible) for a night, take them out to dry in the sun, and then roast them with fire until the pits are dry and hard... Dried clusters are called Longan Brocade." The "Tropical Fruit Tree Cultivation Method" says: "... Often after picking, cut off the branches and soak them in a water tank for about ten minutes; then use bamboo (illegible) and fine sand to shake them, rubbing their shells, turning them from rough to smooth.... Pour them onto the roasting stove to roast... The roasting should be done with low heat, not high heat, to prevent burning the shell. Turn them every four hours or so, and they will be dry after twenty hours. It is necessary to skillfully observe the heat.... After roasting, trim them flat, and shake them in a bamboo (illegible) with (illegible) yellow to evenly coat the shell with yellow color to prevent moths.... Large particles are called 'Official Second,' larger ones are called 'Baldy,' and even larger ones are called 'Big Third,' each box containing fifty catties. Smaller ones are called 'Baldy Second,' and even smaller ones are called 'Xingji,' each box containing sixty catties...."

Worldly matters, just like "the world is imperfect" to be itself, longans, whose "flesh is as clear and white as crystal balls" - as described in "Wuxun Miscellaneous Jade" - are of course no exception: the various pests that destroy longans include the longan beetle, which specializes in eating flower buds during flowering, and white (illegible) worms and black ants, which build nests in the fruit and suck the juice. As for what the "Minor Chronicles of Fujian" says: "In the middle of the longan ripening season, there are flying thieves who specialize in stealing, climbing grafted trees, agile as the wind, like giant bandits: in an instant, thousands of trees are hunted without anyone noticing, called 'nightingales.'... We cannot imagine what kind of creatures these are!..."

The final conclusion is: Most of the sweet, delicious, and beneficial plants for mankind have flourished and spread all over the world, but longans - and lychees, etc. - are still confined to southern Asia and have not ventured far from home. This is not because they lack the qualifications to compete with other fruits, but because they lack a powerful confidant to lend a hand! Now "dried" longans are gradually emerging in major European and American cities. Further cultivation and broadcasting may not take too long (End).

### Rough Emotions

— Lei Ruohua

As a story, sadness can weave into a moving plot; as a drama, it can win the audience's sympathy and tears; but as life, it is just a kind of misfortune, a kind of corrosive. In such days, sadness is already a shame.

One day, a friend told me that he had become wild. At the time, I was silent, but afterwards I often remembered this sentence. Perhaps everyone has such a time: his nerves are sensitive, his emotions are fragile; encountering a stimulus, he becomes a bit hysterical; not as he wishes, tears flow like a spring. He is a sparrow, hiding in his own nest.

It is only those who live a difficult life, who have been tempered and honed, and who can still live bravely, whose emotions become rough. He will not sigh, he will not be sad, he will not sit in a corner of a small building listening to the sound of rain, he will not recite verses about spring flowers and autumn moons. He clenches his teeth, he supports himself. He remembers life, he thinks about life, he wants to live on.

The roughness of emotion is a kind of learning, a kind of worthwhile learning. The wings of a sparrow become hard and it wants to fly far away, and if a person is honest, what is even more important is to be honest with oneself; you may have reasons to deceive others, but on what basis do you want to deceive yourself?

The weather is getting hotter, and summer is coming, do you think winter is far away? Is winter a thing of the past? Do you say that between seasons, it seems like something is missing? Then, how can you say to people again, "Come, let's talk about thrushes, talk about roses, talk about beautiful eyes, and the smiles of youth"? We have this kind of weather!

Become a little wilder, become a little rougher.

### A Child's Life

— Ling Xiao

During the great storm, I didn't notice the destruction of a small life. After my child died, I often thought like this.

Although surrounded by countless tragedies that I can't remember or count, although reason warned me not to resent afterwards things that were worth regretting earlier, although I understand that the losses of the unrecoverable past will be difficult to compensate.

Perhaps it is selfish: I love my recently deceased child. Especially because of poverty and hardship, I felt that I should give the child too little; no, this was controlled by a terrible force, depriving me of the opportunity to give the child anything possible.

My child was eight years old. Coming to Shanghai from my hometown, he lost everything he should have and needed: nutrition, happiness, suffocated in a small building, constantly exposed to sad faces, and even subjected to the irritable violence of his elders. The child was a little sensible, he could no longer support this kind of excessively heavy persecution, and illness began. The fight against the disease requires the acquisition of money and time, these two pillars.

The child was sick for a full three months, and the condition changed a lot. "If it's serious, let's go to the doctor!" "If it's easier, it's probably not serious, so we can wait a few days and make a decision." Sometimes, mental troubles and the hardships of life made me grasp the reason for self-abandonment: "What will the child do when he grows up?"

It wasn't until the terrible symptoms appeared on the child that fear, panic, regret, and resentment made me taste the unbearable bitterness of life. The child's shouting, fainting, and the pale and haggard appearance after stopping breathing, my wife's crying, friends' consolation, I changed from nervous thoughts to numbness, trance, regret, and even emptiness.

Now I deeply feel lonely. My heart is sinking, my brain is convulsing, and I often want to discard the sad memory, every scene, everything that is connected with the child, I pull into my brain and chew on it as much as possible. Until I am in pain, I shed tears, as if my sin of being unable to protect the child has been punished as it deserves, I am suddenly lost and regain my reason.

In this world, there should be nothing cheaper than life. My child is just a sacrificial item in this auction. It is such a common phenomenon for a wave to dissipate in a large whirlpool. I cannot protect my child personally, but how can I protect myself?

But, I understand that the world will eventually allow this kind of love for children.

### Ruminant "Characters"

The great German philosopher Nietzsche, in his "Thus Spoke Zarathustra," said: "How precious it would be if people had ruminant organs in their stomachs!" (This is the general meaning; the original book has been sold to a pancake shop to exchange for pancakes.) People have rumination. Only cattle and horses have this thing.

If people had rumination, what would be the benefit? Nietzsche's original intention is beyond the comprehension of ordinary people, but perhaps the reason is as follows:

Our human enemy is the "stomach": the stomach digests our food and makes us want to eat again after eating. It is simply impossible not to eat. For the sake of eating, all social problems and international incidents follow one after another. Tracing back, isn't it caused by the "stomach"?

A large number of scientists are trying their best to deal with this "stomach," but apart from some news reports, such as "anti-hunger pills" and "special rations," I have not seen any factual manifestations. Once a clever person said: "Wouldn't it be good to inject the air needle for lung disease into the stomach?" No, first, each air needle costs 30 yuan (note: a new legal tender), equivalent to a large dish, which is not suitable for the masses; second, wouldn't a stomach full of air "anger" people to death, even before they could wait for the peace meal? What to do? The best thing is rumination!

Close your eyes and imagine: put the rice down and put it in the ruminant sac; the "stomach" wants to come and plunder it, don't give it; hungry, let it go, don't even need to tighten the waistband; hungry, let it starve for three days, and then return a little from the sac to satisfy the "stomach's" greed; go on like this like "cowhide candy," applying the war of attrition to the digestive function. One meal can last for at least ten days, and leveling rice can be a little more comfortable.

### Free Talk Adds a "Talk Box"

This column now plans to add a "Talk Box" column, soliciting experts or ordinary professionals from all walks of life to reveal the content and secrets of their professions, and describe their personal service opinions and feelings, so that general readers can have a deeper understanding and more correct understanding of various special professions. The number of words should be around 3,000 as the most ideal, and please divide them into paragraphs for publication in installments. Except for specially commissioned articles, contributions from all walks of life are welcome.

### The Memory of Great Men

— Jing Ji

America's most famous botanist, Asa Gray, was able to remember the names of 25,000 plants; Caesar could also remember the names of tens of thousands of his trusted soldiers.

Charlie Chaplin has had a personal secretary who has been with him for seven years, but strangely, according to that secretary, Chaplin still doesn't know his surname.

The famous English poet Byron boasted that he could recite all the poems he had written; but on the contrary, Walter Scott had a really bad memory, he would even forget the poems he had written himself; he once mistakenly thought his own work was written by Byron, and praised it enthusiastically!

The English philosopher Bacon could dictate one of his famous works entirely from memory, without a single mistake; but the American stage star Joseph Jefferson, even after playing "Rip Van Winkle" for thirteen years, still often forgot his lines.

The memory of the British historical authority Macaulay is truly in line with the Chinese saying: "Read ten lines at a glance, and never forget what you've seen!" He could recite any chapter of a book after reading it only once. He wrote many historical masterpieces, but never used any reference books.

The memory of the old American President Roosevelt was also worth praising. When meeting guests, he liked to pay attention to the details, appearance, or actions of the guests. Once he met you, he would never forget you again! When he saw you a second time, he would immediately call you by your name. Once, he met a Japanese banker whom he had not seen for fifteen years, and what surprised the Japanese banker the most was that in the instant they met, he started talking about something they had discussed during their first meeting fifteen years ago!

Lincoln told us a "memory secret": Whenever you want to remember something firmly, you might as well read it aloud, so that sight and hearing can work at the same time.

### Eucalyptus Trees

— Hua Shi

A giant tree produced in Australia, called the eucalyptus tree, is currently attracting the attention of scientists because the oil extracted from the leaves of this tree can be used as fuel.

After many experiments, eucalyptus oil can replace petroleum for any purpose.

This oil has a very high calorific value and is comparable to gasoline. The results of its use are very satisfactory: a car travels twenty-four miles per gallon of gasoline. If eucalyptus oil is mixed with gasoline, one gallon can travel twenty-eight miles. If one gallon of eucalyptus oil is used alone, the car can travel thirty-six miles.

Dr. Dee said that when this oil is mixed with gasoline, kerosene, or alcohol, the engine will not be fouled frequently.

Approximately one thousand catties of leaves can be refined into twenty-five catties of oil, and the method is very simple.

In addition to Australia, northern Africa, such as Algeria, also produces it, but it has not yet been adopted and utilized.

### Strabismus Corrector

— Yong Yun

The eyes, like other organs in the human body, need exercise. A device controlled by electricity has recently been invented that can correct strabismus and can also be used as an instrument for general eye exercises. This type of corrector is not a gimmick used by quack doctors to swindle money, and has been repeatedly tested with significant effectiveness.

### The Maori of New Zealand

— Ma Lan

Most of the world's remaining primitive indigenous peoples are gradually declining, but the Maori of New Zealand are an exception. All anthropologists agree that the cultural level of the Maori is indeed higher than that of other primitive peoples. And their achievements are indeed better than others. They also occupy several seats in the New Zealand Parliament. But what is most puzzling is the question of their origin.

New Zealand is a point in the vast and boundless Pacific Ocean, and it is the only long-term home of the Maori. Although there are similar types of people on other islands in the Pacific, their cultural characteristics are not the same.

The question of the origin of the Maori may never be solved, because there is no conclusive evidence. But some people think they came from India. This theory cannot be believed with certainty, but it cannot be disbelieved either.

We have reason to believe that the Maori initially lived near the Caspian Sea and were white Caucasians. Thousands of years ago, they invaded India via the northwest. Gradually, the Caucasians mixed with the Indians. As a result of population growth, they moved to Myanmar, and then through various islands to Java. Then they passed the northern coast of Australia and reached New Zealand. What is most puzzling is that the vast northern Australian coast did not attract their attention.

The motive for this migration originated from population expansion, and this movement continued for thousands of years. About five hundred years ago, they discovered New Zealand. Before that, they had lived on various islands in the Pacific and were famous navigators. White people did not arrive in New Zealand until after the great migration of the Maori had ended. However, they came from behind and built their own new world. The total population of the entire territory is about one million, which is still not comparable to Shanghai.

### Sharing Weal and Woe

— He Jia Zhi

(Five) Reciprocity

The house suddenly became lively again. Wei Cheng caught sight of Guo Fang and quickly asked, "Where is Sister Cui Zhen?" Guo Fang said, "Follow me." Wei Cheng followed Guo Fang to the outside of Cui Zhen's sleeping room. Wei Cheng said, "Isn't she sleeping in Aunt's room?" Guo Fang pointed to the note on the door frame for him to see and shook his head. Wei Cheng read it and said, "You wrote this. Thank you for your great concern for her." Guo Fang smiled and said, "I also wanted to say these words on her behalf, but you said them first. She is lying down now and doesn't need anyone to comfort her. Let me ask you, do you know if Cui Zhen's uncle and uncle's daughter have returned here from the cemetery?" Wei Cheng said, "Huh! Why are you asking about this? Did Sister Cui Zhen ask you to ask?" Guo Fang was really afraid of waking Cui Zhen with her voice, so she quickly waved her hand and led Wei Cheng outside, smiling and saying, "I'm just asking you, did they, father and daughter, come?" Wei Cheng said, "I don't think so. I was so confused that I didn't even know if Fei Changhe came or not." Then someone came to Wei Cheng to talk. Guo Fang said, "You go. If you meet my brother, ask him to come inside. That Hongqi Zhang, it was decided that he would send us here and also send us back to Shanghai.

The Ye family was bustling until dusk. The Taoist ceremony was over, and most of the relatives and friends had left. Ye Second Madam stroked Wei Cheng's shoulders and back, saying, "Wei Cheng, you are tired today. You knelt down and then got up, got up and then knelt down. During the funeral procession, you had to walk four or five li in total. This is not like a happy occasion, where walking a few more steps doesn't matter. You are tired today." Guo Qi saw Ye Second Madam say this, and followed up, saying, "Wei Cheng, you should go to bed early. It's time for my sister and me to get on the boat. I hope you can come to Shanghai in a month. You are in mourning, so my sister and I dare not accompany you to seek excessive entertainment, but accompanying you to relax and relieve boredom is still permissible." Wei Cheng grabbed Guo Qi's hand and said, "Don't go. It doesn't matter if we let Hongqi Zhang wait one more night. I finally waited for you to come, and I haven't said anything yet." Guo Qi, without waiting for him to state other reasons, said, "If you don't want me to go, I won't go." Wei Cheng learned that Cui Zhen had gotten up as usual, and felt even more comforted in his heart. That night, in the midst of all the busyness, Wei Cheng and Guo Qi had the opportunity to chat, and they talked about Guo Fang. (87)
