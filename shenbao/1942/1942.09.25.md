Nanjing, 24th (Central News Agency)

The Japanese return-visit mission, consisting of three special envoys, Baron Hiranuma, Mr. Arita, and Mr. Nagai, arrived in Nanjing on the 22nd with their entire entourage. They were warmly welcomed by both the government and the public in our country. They have been extremely busy with banquets from high-ranking Chinese and Japanese officials for several days. Despite their busy schedule, Special Envoy Hiranuma and his entourage, all in formal attire, accompanied by Ambassador Shigemitsu and others, took a car to the foot of Purple Mountain at 9:00 AM on the 24th to reverently visit Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Mausoleum. The Chinese and Japanese military police maintained strict security along the way. After the car arrived at the mausoleum park, they were greeted by Xu, the Chief of the Protocol Section of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and alighted. They were greeted by Xiao, the Director of the Bureau of Ceremonies of the Military Affairs Department, in front of the mausoleum and led inside the mausoleum hall to perform a bow. The entire group performed three bows in front of the incense table. Special Envoy Hiranuma then presented a wreath and paid respects to Dr. Sun Yat-sen's portrait. The ceremony was solemn and respectful. After the ceremony, Director Xiao led the special envoys and others around the mausoleum for a week, admiring the remains. Afterwards, they returned to the original place and the whole party bowed before leaving the mausoleum hall. They lingered on the steps, gazing at the distant scenery, surrounded by lush green pines and ancient trees for dozens of minutes. The entire group took photos for remembrance. Special Envoy Hiranuma and others were then accompanied by Director Xiao to inspect the troops at the military academy.

### Full Text of President Wang's Reply at Ambassador Shigemitsu's Banquet

Nanjing, 24th (Central News Agency)

President Wang's reply at Ambassador Shigemitsu Kui's banquet on the evening of the 23rd: I am most grateful for Ambassador Shigemitsu's sincere speech. Recalling my visit to your country last June, I was deeply moved and will never forget the gracious courtesy extended by His Majesty the Emperor. The concern and grand plans of the government officials and the enthusiastic expressions of the people from all walks of life have added boundless courage to my vision of the future of cooperation between the two countries and the co-prosperity of East Asia. This time, I am honored to have the specially appointed envoys, Baron Hiranuma, Mr. Arita, and Mr. Nagai, come from afar to return the visit. I was pleased to learn this morning of His Majesty the Emperor's good health. I have read the Imperial Rescript, which is earnest and sincere. The establishment of a new order in East Asia based on righteousness is a contribution to world peace. It is the glory of East Asia and the virtue of the world. Since the beginning of the Greater East Asia War, the loyalty and bravery of your country's army and navy soldiers, and the united efforts of the entire nation, have truly borne the burden of this lofty and great mission. Although our country is determined to share joys and sorrows, our capabilities are weak, and I am deeply afraid that we will not be able to provide much assistance. We can only strive to improve ourselves and do our best to share this hardship with your country, so that we can reap the same sweetness in the future. This is what I sincerely wish to convey. Three years ago, when Baron Hiranuma was Prime Minister, I traveled from Hanoi to Tokyo and had the opportunity to meet him. At that time, Baron Hiranuma said to me that the results of the last European war produced the League of Nations, which was full of utilitarianism, leading to misdirection and repeated disputes. Until today, the phenomenon of infighting persists. China and Japan should reverse this trend and rely on the Eastern spirit of righteousness to reunite. Baron Hiranuma made this grand proposal when the current European war had not yet occurred, and his foresight and insight into the root causes are truly admirable. At the same time, I also met Mr. Arita when he was Minister of Foreign Affairs and discussed that he had wanted to eliminate the Incident before it occurred when he was Ambassador to our country a year before the Incident, but unfortunately our country's government failed to understand, resulting in regret. I met Mr. Nagai in Tianjin twelve years ago and discussed the general trend of East Asia and the relationship between China and Japan, deeply concerned about planning ahead. Today, I am reunited with the three of you, recalling the past and feeling deeply moved. The other members of the mission are also eminent figures in your country's court, whom I have long admired. I am delighted to meet you today and hope to learn much from you during these precious few days, so as to enlighten my journey. I deeply believe that the friendship between our two countries will be further strengthened because of the arrival of these three special envoys, and the overall situation in East Asia will be better and more effectively resolved because of this. Tonight, I am honored to receive the generous hospitality of Ambassador Shigemitsu. I have a word to offer to comfort the special envoys and the members of the mission. For more than two years, the colleagues of the National Government and the staff of this embassy, including Ambassador Shigemitsu, and the commanders-in-chief, including General Hata, have been consulting with each other frankly and honestly, based on our beliefs and speaking directly, without any estrangement. Because we are working together as comrades in East Asia, we can do this. I would like to take this opportunity to raise the host's glass and wish Baron Hiranuma, Mr. Arita, and Mr. Nagai, and all of you, good health, and to wish the victory of the Greater East Asia War and the success of the construction of a new order in East Asia based on righteousness.

### Soviet Ships Mobilized on the Volga River, Street Fighting in Stalingrad, Ruins Provide Convenience to the Soviets, German Advance Feels Unusually Difficult

Stockholm, Sweden, 24th (Havas)

Soviet military authorities yesterday mobilized the Volga River gunboat flotilla for the first time to participate in the defense of Stalingrad, bombarding German-Romanian positions. It is claimed that eight enemy artillery positions were destroyed. At the same time, intense street fighting continues in the Stalingrad city area, with both sides deploying reinforcements. However, the battle situation is chaotic. All that is known is that German forces have occupied several more streets in the south of the city, while Soviet forces have recaptured several streets in the north. The defending forces in that area launched a counterattack, reportedly repelling the Germans. City residents have been mobilized to strengthen defenses to cope with new offensives. The German side now admits that attacking Stalingrad will require considerable time and significant sacrifices.

Berlin, 24th (Haitong News Agency)

Street fighting continues in Stalingrad. The ruins of the city provide great convenience to the Soviet forces, making the German advance extremely difficult. However, German forces made further progress in the city area yesterday and cleared out the Soviet forces in the occupied areas. In the north of the city, German forces also repelled a strong Soviet attack. Air battles over Stalingrad have been incessant. German aircraft shot down 37 Soviet aircraft yesterday without any losses. German pressure on Grozny has increased. After occupying Vila Dimirov, Taileke, and Daskojie, the German forces repelled repeated Soviet counterattacks. Fighting is taking place in the plains and mountainous areas. On the Caucasus front, German forces are operating along the railway leading to Kasbek northeast of Osonikis. Soviet forces in the Voronezh area have launched attacks with tanks, artillery, and aircraft but have not succeeded. On the central sector of the Eastern Front, German forces launched a fierce counterattack and reached their destination. Soviet forces in the area of Rzhev, after receiving reinforcements, continued their attacks yesterday. Soviet forces have failed to break through the German lines in any area. The Soviet forces that had penetrated the German lines were repelled. Flat-trajectory artillery units are most active in the Rzhev area.

Stockholm, Sweden, 23rd (Havas)

Today marks the 458th day of the German-Soviet war. The fighting in the Stalingrad city area has stabilized, with only concentrated bombing by the German Air Force. In the past few days, the opposing sides were engaged in close combat, making it impossible to deploy aircraft for bombing. However, German dive bombers resumed their attacks yesterday, striking a power plant in the northern suburbs of the city. Two battalions of the Red Army and one battalion of female soldiers were defending the position. The power plant was destroyed, reportedly killing at least 1,000 defenders. It is reported that German forces have occupied the city's General Post Office, but the Red Army continues to hold its original position in the strategic area near the Gorky Sanatorium, unshaken, though it is constantly subjected to artillery bombardment by German forces. On the Caucasus front, German forces continue to make progress. It is reported that German armored units have reached 30 miles south of the Terek River and are approaching the railway center, which is the junction of the railways leading to Grozny and Ordzhonikidze. Military observers say that Ordzhonikidze is the center of the Red Army's defenses in the Caucasus region and the key to accessing the passes of Mount Christoye. The German General Staff wants to attack the city from the rear, but the Red Army is resolutely resisting, with no signs of weakening. A large number of reinforcements have been transferred from Baku to reinforce the Red Army. The Red Army is utilizing the terrain to its advantage, so the German forces are taking precautions everywhere to avoid falling into ambushes.

At the same time, according to reports from London, British General Platt, the commander-in-chief of British forces in Madagascar, announced on the Antananarivo radio station that the British have established military administration in the city.

Governor-General Anet of Madagascar recently telegraphed the Colonial Minister reporting that Antananarivo, the capital of the island, has been lost, saying that our troops resisted to the city limits, but were unable to prevent the enemy from entering the city due to the disparity in numbers. The bravery of our troops will be forever etched in history. I have found no evidence of dereliction of duty by officials. Radio and telegraph operators were able to remain loyal to their duties. The people of the city were able to remain calm in the face of this event.

Lisbon, 23rd (Allied Press)

According to informal sources here, British forces have occupied Antananarivo, the capital of Madagascar. This news has not yet been confirmed by Vichy or London. The information was broadcast by the Antananarivo radio station last night during a music broadcast when a voice suddenly stated that a British officer reported that British forces had occupied the capital at 5:00 PM on Friday. Antananarivo is 90 miles from the east coast, with a population of approximately 70,000. It is located 5,000 feet above sea level and has a beautiful landscape. To the west is a fertile expanse of land. It was occupied by France on September 10, 1895, and became a French territory.

### Soviet, British, and American Envoys Meet with Iranian Prime Minister, British Commander Wilson Arrives in Baghdad

Ankara, 24th (Haitong News Agency)

The Soviet Ambassador and the British and American Ministers in Tehran held a lengthy meeting yesterday with the Iranian Prime Minister and Foreign Minister. The King of Iran also received the Prime Minister in the afternoon. Political circles in Tehran believe that the Allied powers have brought Iranian participation in the war to its highest degree. Although the Kavani government is unlikely to declare war immediately, it has had to make the greatest concessions under diplomatic pressure. Kavani recently sent letters to provincial authorities urging them to maintain close cooperation with the occupying forces.

Lisbon, 24th (Allied Press)

According to reports from the capital of Iraq, General Wilson, the newly appointed British commander-in-chief of Iran and Iraq, arrived in Baghdad yesterday.

### U.S. House of Representatives Passes Presidential Proposal to Prevent Inflation

Washington, 24th (Havas)

The House of Representatives last night passed President Roosevelt's Inflation Prevention Act by a vote of 284 to 96. The bill includes an amendment on agricultural product prices, stipulating a 5% increase in selling prices.

Washington, 23rd (Havas)

The House of Representatives today passed a bill proposed by the Agriculture Committee by a vote of 163 to 105, stipulating that production costs should be included in the price ceiling for agricultural products. This is a major victory for the farmers' faction over the government. After the implementation of this measure, the selling price of agricultural products will be 10% to 12% higher than the government expected. As a result, the national treasury will increase its expenditure by 300 million to 350 million U.S. dollars each year.

### Ambassador Nomura Speaks

Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency)

Former Ambassador to the United States, Mr. Kichisaburo Nomura, who recently returned to Japan from the United States, is currently resting in his hometown. He recently told a reporter from the Allied Press that if the United States prepares for war with a five-year plan, Japan will definitely complete the Greater East Asia War with a strength of more than ten years. At present, the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere has become an established fact, and there is no room for third-country interference. The United States, which advocates Pan-Americanism and rejects third-country interference in the Western Hemisphere, still denies the great unity of the East Asian nations, which is even more unreasonable. However, I believe that the understanding of the new order in East Asia by Britain, the United States, and other countries around the world, or its recognition, is only a matter of time. Today, all the nations of Asia have discovered new ideals and hopes because of the Greater East Asia War, and are thereby cooperating in the construction of Asia for Asians.

### Uruguayan Foreign Minister Speaks on the Attitude of South American Countries

Santiago, Chile, 24th (Haitong News Agency)

Uruguayan Foreign Minister Guini told reporters that the American republics should abide by the resolutions of the Rio de Janeiro Pan-American Conference. Although Chile and Argentina are non-belligerent nations, their attitude should be the same as that of Uruguay in 1917. This attitude was decided by the foreign ministers of the American republics at a meeting in Rio de Janeiro. The ideal of the League of Nations was the foundation for lasting peace, but it failed because of the unequal rights of the member states. Therefore, the formation of an alliance between the American nations is also impossible.

### Police Department Embarks on Eliminating Pickpockets, Petty Thieves, Assassinations, and Kidnappings No Longer Seen, Eliminating Petty Thieves, Hoping for Resident Cooperation

The Shanghai Times reports that a certain official of the Municipal Council recently stated that since all major crimes in the Public Concession have been eliminated, the Police Department is now dedicated to eliminating minor crimes such as pickpocketing, robbery, and theft of bicycles. Before the outbreak of the Pacific War, major criminals and petty thieves were rampant in Shanghai, with endless cases of crime, and assassinations and kidnappings occurred daily. The public was not safe, but today is different from the past. Criminals can hardly escape the police's net, and are arrested and imprisoned every time they commit a crime. Therefore, other criminals have

### Disappeared

Daring not to move. Shanghai, which was known as the Chicago of the East, is no longer seeing major crimes. Those who used to hire bodyguards for self-defense can now rest assured that they will not be kidnapped. The only thing that still makes Shanghai residents unhappy today is petty theft. However, if the methods currently implemented by the police are effective, this unhappiness will not last long. The police are now rounding up vagrants and vagabonds, investigating their fingerprints, and conducting thorough interrogations. The police have also repeatedly urged the public to report cases of pickpocketing and bicycle theft, as the police can

### Swiftly Arrest

Minor crimes upon receiving reports. The public must provide assistance to the police. Taking pickpockets as an example, the police already know the names of many pickpockets and their activity locations. The police have also established new regulations requiring the presentation of identification when buying, selling, or pawning bicycles. This law has greatly reduced bicycle thefts, but cooperation from the public is still hoped for. If there are any thefts, immediately report the location of the theft and other details.

### Mid-Autumn Festival Settlement, All Industries Stable

Yesterday was the Mid-Autumn Festival settlement day for all industries. After the joint preparation committee of banks and the Central Reserve Bank made every effort to regulate the stability of interbank finance in the market, the banks and financial institutions provided accommodation to companies, factories, and businesses for their dues on the autumn festival, as their own foundations became more sufficient. At the same time, the old debts released by various industries were able to be recovered by nineteen percent due to the market improvements. Therefore, they have all safely passed this settlement day. As for the financial market, there are no special tensions in accordance with the stable money supply. Regarding the reorganization or closure of some small money shops and banks, after the authorities took effective measures to crack down on them in the speculative market, these speculative money shops and banks could no longer use their skills, and reorganization and closure were the appropriate phenomena, which were unrelated to the overall financial situation. Yesterday, all banks, financial institutions, and civil factories and businesses closed in accordance with regulations. The resumption of business will be today, and all bills and receipts during the holiday period will be handled today.

### Continuous Food Supply, No Worry of Scarcity

Authoritative sources point out that the food situation in the city has returned to stability from turmoil, as there has been no shortage of food supply for the population. The source of food rice has long been completely organized and distributed by the highest authorities in the city, and the allocation matters are coordinated by the Food Office of the Municipal Council. In the future, food rice will continue to be shipped to Shanghai from the rice-producing areas of Central China for the market, and citizens are already accustomed to using miscellaneous grains and flour as daily supplementary food, so the rationing of food will not be insufficient. It is reported that since the implementation of rationing on July 6th, the two concessions have distributed a total of eleven installments totaling approximately 390,000 shi of whole rice and broken rice, totaling 310,000 bags, of which the Public Concession accounted for 250,000 shi or 200,000 bags, and the French Concession accounted for 140,000 shi or 110,000 bags. From the 21st of this month, the household ration will be distributed three times a month. If each person is given two liters of rice each time, the consumption of food rice in the two concessions will be 140,000 shi or more than 110,000 bags.

### Old Zhabei Police Station Issues Notice to Residents to Carefully Conceal Lights

After the designation of seven model areas for air defense light control exercises in the Public Concession area, all preparations for air defense control are proceeding at a high speed. The Old Zhabei Police Station also notified the Lianbao chiefs of the district a few days ago to strictly pay attention to the lighting of shops, stating that in order to strictly control the lights, all electric lights and advertising lights outside the shops have already been announced to be extinguished. All electric lights in each household must be fitted with black cloth lampshades and black cloth curtains or covered with black paper before the 25th of this month. If there are still violations of the control, severe punishment will be imposed without leniency. Please forward the instructions to your subordinates to comply. In addition, the Lianbao chiefs of Old Zhabei notified the Jia chiefs and household heads that the authorities have issued repeated orders for the implementation of light control, and while many residents in the bao have complied with the methods, there are still some who have not complied and are waiting to see. As this matter concerns important air defense matters, we are hereby issuing a notice again, urging the residents of this bao to purchase them as soon as possible before the 25th of this month and not to delay any further, lest they incur punishment.

### French Concession Model Area Conducts Light Control Exercise

### Former Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council, Mr. Fessenden, Encounters Trouble on a Bus; Mr. Fessenden Files a Complaint with the French Consulate Against the French Tram Company; The Case is Scheduled to be Heard by Judge Corbin Early Next Month

According to the English-language "North China Daily News," reliable sources report that Mr. Fessenden, former Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council, recently encountered a dispute on a public bus in the French Concession when he attempted to use a damaged Central Reserve Bank note to pay his fare, which the ticket seller refused. Private mediation proved ineffective, and Mr. Fessenden has now filed a lawsuit with the French Consular Court against the French Tram and Electric Light Company, claiming inconvenience and mental distress. He is demanding an apology and compensation for emotional damages, though the amount of compensation sought is minimal, as his intention is to set a precedent. It is reported that the case is scheduled to be heard by Judge Corbin early next month. The incident occurred when Mr. Fessenden boarded the bus and attempted to pay with a damaged one-yuan Central Reserve Bank note, which the ticket seller refused to accept. Mr. Fessenden insisted, and the bus came to a halt. The conductor asked all passengers to transfer to another bus, leaving only Mr. Fessenden behind. Subsequently, police were summoned and Mr. Fessenden was taken to the McClellan Police Station, where he was released immediately upon being identified as the former Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council.

### British and American Community Associations Issue Armbands

According to the English-language "North China Daily News," it has been announced that the British and American Community Associations in Shanghai, in accordance with recently promulgated regulations from the Japanese authorities, will begin issuing armbands to British and American residents starting on Saturday and Sunday, respectively. The armbands will cost three yuan each and are required for all enemy nationals aged thirteen and above. All applicants should apply in person at the British and American Community Associations and present their passports or consular registration certificates. There has been no announcement yet from other foreign communities in Shanghai, whose countries are at war with Japan or have severed diplomatic relations, regarding the issuance of armbands.

### Application Period for Student Meal Subsidies Extended by Two Days

The student meal subsidy campaign initiated by the Shanghai YMCA and YWCA began on the 17th of this month. Over the past few days, the number of applicants has been extremely high, with the majority having received scholarships from the Shen Bao and Xin Bao newspapers or free tuition from schools at the beginning of the semester. Due to living alone in Shanghai or scheduling constraints, they have experienced great difficulty managing their meals independently. The application deadline was originally set for yesterday, but in response to requests from many students, it has been extended for two more days. The urgent need for meal relief for impoverished students is evident, and the associations' limited financial resources mean that the completion of this relief effort depends entirely on the generous donations of caring people in society. It is sincerely hoped that all sectors of society will strive to contribute.

### How to Prevent and Treat Dysentery

The prolonged heat of this summer is the most severe in nearly thirty years, leading to a cholera epidemic and successive deaths. Since the arrival of autumn, the weather has been erratic, and dysentery is once again rampant. Dr. Song Daren's insights on how to prevent and treat dysentery are particularly insightful. Excerpts are as follows:

Dysentery is divided into six types: enteritis dysentery, bacterial dysentery, amoebic dysentery, digestive difficulty dysentery, constipation dysentery, and tonic deficiency dysentery.

To treat a disease, one must first understand it, and to understand it, one must rely on instruments. In ancient times, the treatment of diseases was limited by the constraints of the environment. Only visual and auditory questioning was used to determine that the color of the diarrhea was red, indicating a blood disorder, or white, indicating a Qi disorder. If the color was varied, it was called five-color dysentery; if it occurred intermittently, it was called recurrent dysentery; and if food could not be ingested, it was called silent dysentery. Whether it was diarrhea or dysentery was determined solely by the smoothness of the bowel movement. The true nature of the disease remained unknown due to the lack of instrumental assistance. Furthermore, the theory that sudden illnesses are due to heat and chronic illnesses are due to cold is untenable, as there is no fixed boundary between sudden and chronic, or between cold and heat. How can we trust such theories? Mild illnesses may heal without medication, but severe illnesses pose immediate danger. Because the true nature of the disease is not understood, many die without knowing the cause, attributing it to fate, and doctors are not held accountable. This is deeply regrettable. Therefore, it is necessary to solve the problem with scientific methods, which means classifying the types of causes.

Of the six types of dysentery, the latter three are chronic, non-contagious, unrelated to time, and their symptoms are not severe, such as minimal weight change and no abdominal tenderness. As for enteritis dysentery, bacterial dysentery, or amoebic dysentery, their initial onset is accompanied by systemic symptoms such as fatigue, dizziness, and bloating. Subsequently, the stool gradually becomes painful, and then there is tenesmus and mucoid bloody stools, with the number of bowel movements ranging from several to dozens of times a day. The components are nothing more than mucus, blood, and pus. The symptoms of these three types of dysentery are often similar and difficult to distinguish. Bacterial dysentery is the most serious, while amoebic dysentery easily turns into chronic enteritis, which is characterized by intestinal gas, abdominal distension, and rumbling, but without blood. Generally speaking, relying solely on symptoms often fails to obtain a correct diagnosis. It is necessary to perform a general microscopic examination or culture of the stool to clearly identify whether it is enteritis, bacterial dysentery, or amoebic dysentery.

Dysentery is a dangerous infectious disease, but there is no active preventive method. Therefore, one can only be careful about diet for prevention. If dysentery is found nearby, it should be reported to the health department immediately. If one has dysentery, one should seek medical treatment immediately to identify the type of dysentery. After a correct diagnosis, appropriate treatment should be administered. Finally, it must be mentioned that after recovery, the stool should be tested to ensure that no bacteria or amoebas remain to prevent the recurrence of dysentery. There is also a type of dysentery called epidemic dysentery, which occurs exclusively in children and is rapidly fatal. The pathology and treatment differ greatly from those of adults, so caution must be exercised.

The Shanghai Industrial Vocational School was founded by the China Cotton Mill Association and has now begun classes. The school is located in the factory district of Shanghai on Macau Road, where the Shenxin No. 9 Mill has provided a large building as a campus. Because there are spacious dormitories, students can live on campus. Meals are also provided by the school for a modest fee of only one hundred yuan per person per month. The school originally had three departments: textile, dyeing and chemistry, and machinery, and admitted junior high school graduates for a five-year course of study. Now, in view of the need to increase cotton production by developing water conservancy, a special water conservancy engineering class has been added, and high school graduates and those with equivalent qualifications are admitted for a three-year course of study. Enrollment has already begun, and the regulations are on file. Classes are scheduled to begin around Double Ten Day.

### Harmonizing Poems at Mr. Yokoyama's Banquet at the West Lake Restaurant

"An Occasional Poem at the West Lake Restaurant" (Yasuka Masaatsu)
Mist veils the willows on the dike, faintly visible.
A boat carrying water chestnuts comes slowly.
Without wine or poetry, I drunkenly recline,
The moon lingers over the tower late into the night.

"Respectfully Harmonizing with Mr. Yasuka" (Ni Yichi)
The poetry of Yangming, the literature of Wen and Li, are hard to find.
The spring breeze reveals your face, the meaning is ethereal, the words are distinct.
Reading it once, you nod your head,
A masterpiece that makes one sigh.

"Respectfully Presented to Minister Yokoyama" (Zhang Luxia)
Not old in the autumn, with an iron heart firm,
Mountain energy faces the sun, the position is upright and firm.
Talented and virtuous, gathered in the same room,
Truly like a Luoshe gathering of heroes.

"Delighted to Harmonize with Mr. Zhang Luxia" (Yasuka Masaatsu)
Remembering the virtues of the sages of autumn,
Worried about the people of the mountains and rivers, asking about their well-being.
Waiting for the arrival of Mount Tai, with much leisure,
Being true to your heart and dedicated to your duties, uniquely strong.

"Harmonizing with Mr. Zhang Luxia's Rhymes" (Peng Yilian)
With a bold spirit, you stand as a pillar,
Your talent as high as mountains and the Big Dipper, firmly grasping the position.
Virtuous and kind, treating the people as your own children,
Truly inheriting the mantle of the sages, surpassing your predecessors.

"Following Mr. Lüxia's Style" (Sun Shousu)
A cloud hanging over the East Sea,
Mountain shadows dim and vast in the mist.
Talented guests fill the hall, chatting and laughing,
Truly using colorful brushes to create a long rainbow.

"Presented to Minister Yokoyama" (Qu Cunpu)
A crane soaring over the Yangtze River from afar,
The mountain air connects with the sea air in a beautiful way.
Hoping to be able to accompany you and join hands,
Truly discerning insights that can never be erased.

"Respectfully Presented to Minister Yokoyama" (Xu Tieshan)
Transforming fierceness into auspicious harmony,
Beyond the mountains, green mountains are beautiful.
Talented heroes sit together in one hall,
Sincerely singing the song of peace.

"Respectfully Presented to Minister Yokoyama" (Dai Junyi)
Sailing thousands of miles across the sea,
Mountain scenery and waterscapes in paintings.
Seeking for a long time, you have shown sincere intentions,
Truly making everyone smile with joy.

"Following Mr. Luxia's Style" (Ni Yichi)
Coming from the East Sea, illuminating China,
Mountain light and water colors shining with morning glow.
Talented people leaping forward, hoping to reach the times,
Truly making people of the same culture unite as one family.

"Delighted to Present to Mr. Yasuka" (Peng Yilian)
Your name is fragrant with righteousness and benevolence,
The Mount Gang has auspicious celebrations and long blessings.
You are upright and just, with no superiors or inferiors,
Dedicated to poetry and books, you suddenly stand out.

Talking heart to heart at the banquet,
The air of peace is thick.
People of the same culture and the same race are brothers,
Wishing you great harmony from now on.

"Mr. Yasuka Visits Our Country, Respectfully Presenting a Short Poem" (Sun Shousu)
Mr. Yasuka's visit has brought glory to our country,
What fortune to meet you in person.
Indeed, knowledge and action can be united as one,
After Yangming, there is Yasuka.

"Respectfully Presented to Mr. Yasuka" (Zhang Luxia)
From Edo come many talented scholars,
Three perfections are passed down from Taketa.
Today, meeting you and receiving your guidance,
The source is deep, surpassing the sages.

"Welcoming Mr. Yasuka" (Ni Yichi)
Mr. Yasuka's great reputation resonates in the East,
Continuing the learning and cultivation of Yangming.
Not only are we fortunate to meet you today,
But also to communicate culture, this is the former ferry.

"Respectfully Presented to Mr. Yasuka" (Xu Tieshan)
Mr. Slow Your Whip in Shanghai,
Famous People on the Sea Recognize Virtuous People.
Most of all, we treat each other with the same heart,
The great cause of East Asia is to be shared together.

"Presenting to Master Yasuka for Correction" (Qu Cunpu)
Buddhists abandon ego and see no ego,
There is no struggle, one thread of Yangming's purpose.
The heart of a thousand autumns is at peace.

The Mount Gang stands tall, revealing your spirit.

Spring and Autumn

### Saving the Children - Introducing Yang Guang Volunteer Night School

— Yuan Ying

More than twenty years ago, Mr. Lu Xun had already loudly appealed to save the children.

But even today, twenty years later, we can still easily and commonly see countless out-of-school and homeless children. Compared with the young masters who go to school in chauffeur-driven cars, no one knows how many times greater this huge, uncountable number is.

This is an undeniable fact of the year. In addition to adding half of its population, Shanghai has also increased its number of poor children. Groups of unkempt, barefoot children can be seen everywhere in the streets and alleys, next to garbage bins. Of course, they are also the masters of the future of society and the country, and they also urgently need good education. However, our society abandons and rejects them, and disdains and despises them. The sacred schools even refuse to allow this group of little beggars to enter. That is the world of the young masters who ride in chauffeur-driven cars.

How cold this is to our other future masters. Their desire for knowledge is no less than that of others, and their talents are by no means mediocre. On the contrary, there are countless hopes among them. Don't we know that most of the great figures of the past and present, both Chinese and foreign, such as Edison, Gorky, Stevenson, all came from poor backgrounds?

However, the high tide of life is pressing them tightly. They want to study, but they also need to eat. In these times when it is not easy to get food, what they need is not a school that costs money.

And there are too few free schools in Shanghai. It is not that there are no charitable people in Shanghai (we can see the great benefactors who are published in large fonts in the newspapers every day), but after working all day for a living, who still has time to do this volunteer education work? In a word, they are too busy taking care of themselves.

Therefore, our school, Yang Guang Volunteer Night School, was born. Because we are still students, we do not have heavy burdens or hard work. What we have is some free time and energy in the evening. We are willing and should use these forces to give back to society, to give back to the country, and to give back to humanity.

The funds come from donations raised by each person from friends and relatives. Because of the satisfactory performance of each donation, we are more convinced that there are still many enthusiastic charitable people who sympathize with us. This has further increased our courage and encouraged our confidence. We don't want to show off, nor do we need a penny of salary. Our unanimous hope is only to make some contribution to society, the country, and humanity, even if it is only one in ten thousand.

Although this road is hard work and difficult, many friends and relatives have told us, and we ourselves are very clear. But in order to save the children, we can only bear the hardships and carry this difficult burden. Sympathy will increase our courage, and hope will strengthen our confidence in victory. In the great call of justice, we will dedicate all our strength for humanity.

(Our school is located at No. 7, Xilianjili, Haig Road, Jing'an Temple Road. Tuition and fees are completely free, and books are provided. The school opening date is September 28, and the time is from 5:00 to 7:30 PM. Classes range from the first grade of elementary school to the sixth grade. We are willing to do our best to help the poor children living nearby realize their hope of studying in a short time.) (In return for the scholarship)

### Chang'e's Departure

— Yin

This year's moonlight may make you feel黯然(dispirited). If it is really黯然(dispirited), then on the eve of the Mid-Autumn Festival, when the flames of war on Earth spread to the Moon, Miss Chang'e's emotions were immersed in contradiction and depression. On one hand, she was terrified that life would experience many changes, and on the other hand, she wanted to take the opportunity to go to a new world to operate. After considering again and again, she finally quietly flew out of the Lunar Palace and landed randomly and aimlessly in some place.

A woman's nature is ultimately afraid of烦燥(annoyance). As she flew over a corner where there was a burst of prosperous song and dance music——Shanghai seemed to have a driving force, and Miss Chang'e landed.

On that night, Miss Chang'e's beautiful face and graceful figure were surrounded by a group of men who were celebrating the Mid-Autumn Festival before it even arrived. The fragrant and sweet champagne bewitched Miss Chang'e's eyes, and she unconsciously forgot her dignity and forgot her mission, and like a madman, she also rolled into the whirlwind of frivolity.

Humanity in the lunar world has lost Chang'e and has become黯然(dispirited).

Assuming that someone finds that this year's moonlight is still the same, then Chang'e is smiling by your side.

### Work

— Zhang Yueshan

Diligence and frugality intertwine to form genius (He Jia)

Drive your business; or it will drive you (Franklin)

Work without a plan is like navigation without a compass (English proverb)

Work is the greatest remedy for mankind's painful diseases (Franklin)

Working for the benefit of all is working for yourself (Henry Ford)

Work has bitter roots but sweet fruit (English proverb)

People struggle and suffer for work, whether foolish or intelligent, merely to seize freedom (茄立丽/Jia Li Li?)

### The Ever-Deteriorating Pearl and Jade Industry

— Chen Jing

Indeed, those who make a living in the pearl and jade industry today will sigh with emotion when they talk about the past. Even if we don't compare it with the booming situation of twenty or thirty years ago, we can't help but sigh at the decline in recent years.

Prosperity and decline both have underlying reasons. There are many reasons for the decline of the pearl and jade industry. Let me mention one or two:

(1) The high price of goods. The value of goods from five or six years ago has increased by ten, fifteen, or thirty times, causing even the middle class to give up the idea of wearing pearls and diamonds. Customers want discounts. (2) The instability of the market. In the past, in peaceful times, people with a little savings would buy accessories to fill the scene. Now it is different. Many industries are experiencing turbulence. Everyone has changed their minds and is using their savings to invest in speculation, taking the opportunity to profit. Pearls and diamonds are no longer asked about.

(3) The scarcity of inventory. Even if there are occasional nouveau riche wives and grandmothers who widely search for pearls and diamonds, wanting to bring glory to their family, the goods are like foreign films in Shanghai. The source of supply has long been interrupted. The goods on the market are all inferior. Buyers cannot find goods that are satisfactory to them.

(4) The most important thing is that the pearl and jade industry can only prosper when all industries are prospering first. If all industries stagnate, the pearl and jade industry will immediately come to a complete standstill. As the saying goes, "First comes warmth and fullness, then comes wealth and nobility."

In addition to the above four points, there is an even more fatal wound. Think about it, pearls and diamonds are neither as afraid of moisture as cigarettes, nor as afraid of water leakage as towels and cloth, and they are not as expensive as gold ornaments, which are fifty or sixty times more expensive than they were five or six years ago. Why do people hoard cigarettes and towels and cloth, but not pearls and diamonds, which are easy to hoard? Why do buyers prefer to buy expensive gold ornaments and abandon cheaper ones? In a word, the pearl and jade industry has no public, unified, and formal price. When buyers buy, they often raise the price by two or three times the cost. When they sell, they often bleed dry the poor devils, thus losing commercial credit and deteriorating.

At present, senior gentlemen have also broken the concept of sons inheriting their fathers' business and have also realized that the decline of the industry is irreparable. There are very few young people who inherit their fathers' business.

However, this wealthy industry's pearl and jade market is still full of people in ragged clothes. They are clamoring and arguing, as if struggling on the hunger line. If you have time to visit the Times Theater, you will be shocked and saddened by the ferocious expressions.

### Riding in the Same Boat Through Storms

— He Jia Zhi

(9) Hell on Earth

Cui Zhen knew that she was Wei Yunqing's daughter, bit her lower lip, glared at her, and did not answer her words. The woman went out. There was a sound of footsteps outside, and the people guarding the door hurriedly stepped aside. Wei Shaoyun and his gang came in. His head was wrapped in a piece of blue cloth, there were drops of blood on the collar of his suit, and there were two deep black marks on both sides of his pants legs. This time, he was not as obsequious as before. He straightened his chest, inserted both hands into his waist, and shouted, "Who told you to sit there grandiosely? Get up for me! "Cui Zhen said, "It's none of your business." Wei Shaoyun said to his followers, "Take her down. The young master is here, and you don't know Mount Tai. What the hell is she?" The followers pulled Cui Zhen down. Wei Shaoyun said, "Kneel down for me. I knelt to you just now, and now it's your turn to kneel to me. Kneel!" Cui Zhen said, "You knelt because you were willing to. Why should I kneel to you?" One of his followers winked at Wei Shaoyun, and Wei Shaoyun shouted, "Kneel or not? I'll beat you!" As soon as Wei Shaoyun's words came out of his mouth, Cui Zhen felt someone grab her ear, someone press down on her leg, and a blow on her back. Her eyes blurred. She knelt down. Wei Shaoyun said, "Bian Cuizhen, you, you knelt to me! What do you want to ask of me? If you speak nicely, I, Young Master Wei, may not hold you accountable." Cui Zhen spat a mouthful of saliva, but did not hit Wei Shaoyun's face. Wei Shaoyun's anger rose again and said, "Rope! Rope!" The followers were only worried that Wei Shaoyun would not order them to do it. They thought it was an opportunity to avenge the young master and immediately took out thick and thin ropes to tie up Cui Zhen's hands and feet. (186)
