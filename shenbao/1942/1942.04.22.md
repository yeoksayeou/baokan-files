### Three US Aircraft Carriers Appear in the Western Pacific; Japanese Headquarters Announces Air Raid Details

Tokyo, 21st (Domei News Agency) – The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced yesterday at 5:50 PM that three enemy aircraft carriers, escorted by a fleet, were discovered in the Western Pacific on the 18th of this month. Fearing a Japanese counterattack, they retreated before approaching the Japanese coast. On the same day, approximately ten enemy aircraft, identified as North American B-25s, appeared singly or in pairs over Tokyo and several other locations. Those not shot down likely escaped towards mainland China. Damage from the bombings was minimal, it was reported.

Tokyo, 21st (Domei News Agency) – The enemy air raid on Japanese territory on the 18th was largely ineffective due to the calm response of the Japanese air defense authorities and the entire populace. Enemy aircraft were either destroyed or fled towards China. According to a battle report from the [blank] Flying Squadron, at 12:12 PM on the 18th, information was received that two enemy aircraft had appeared over Mito. The squadron immediately deployed to the Tokyo-Yokohama area to intercept them. After an hour, a North American B-25 type enemy aircraft with a malfunctioning engine was spotted heading west at an altitude of about 1,000 meters or less. The attack commenced over the waters off Shinagawa. The enemy aircraft descended, while ground anti-aircraft batteries also opened heavy fire. The enemy aircraft further reduced altitude in an attempt to escape, while returning fire with machine guns. It fled along the [blank] River into the sea, its altitude at less than 100 meters. Fearing pursuit, the enemy aircraft hastily dropped several remaining bombs and began to climb. The Japanese aircraft pursued closely, attacking fiercely to prevent escape, until they reached the waters near Izu Oshima. The enemy aircraft’s right engine emitted black smoke, and it slowly nosedived, suddenly plunging into a cloudbank ahead and disappearing from sight. Based on the circumstances at the time, it is undoubtedly believed that the enemy aircraft could not have escaped far and has crashed into the sea. Furthermore, according to Lieutenant Umekawa of the [blank] Unit, regarding the air combat situation on that day, "At 12:50 PM on the 18th, while we were flying over Mito Airfield, we spotted an enemy aircraft flying south at low altitude. We immediately launched a fierce attack. The enemy aircraft, hit by bullets, leaked fuel and fled to the skies over Chiba Prefecture’s Chigata Airfield, where it eventually caught fire and crashed to low altitude before fleeing towards the sea. We were unable to continue the pursuit due to fuel limitations, which is deeply regrettable. Based on the circumstances at the time, it is undoubtedly believed that the aircraft has crashed into the sea."

### Japanese Troops on Panay Island Occupy Calinog; Iloilo City Reduced to Scorched Earth

Manila, 21st (Domei News Agency) – According to a reconnaissance report from the Japanese Army, a certain unit pursuing enemy forces on the Panay plain occupied Calinog, a strategic point in the central Panay plain (located 65 kilometers north of Iloilo), on the afternoon of the 19th. The American and Filipino military bases of Taytes and Olamide were set ablaze, creating intense fires, with smoke rising high above central Panay.

Washington, [blank] 21st (Reuters) – The US Army Department announced this morning that American forces on Panay Island (Philippines), outnumbered, have retreated from two positions in Antique Province.

Iloilo, 19th (Domei News Agency) – Iloilo, a major sugar-producing area accounting for about 70% of the Philippines' production, has suffered severe damage due to arson by American and Filipino forces. Only a portion of the residential area remains untouched. The former factories and city streets are now a scene of scorched earth, with black smoke lingering everywhere, a truly tragic sight. Tens of thousands of piculs of sugar stored in sugar mills and along the coast have melted in the fire and turned into liquid, flowing across the streets.

Washington, 20th (Havas) – According to a recent announcement by the Army Department, Japanese dive bombers attacked Corregidor Island in the Philippines five times in the past 24 hours.

### Curtin and MacArthur Hold Secret Talks

Stockholm, Sweden, 21st (Haitong News Agency) – Australian Prime Minister Curtin held a meeting with General MacArthur, Commander-in-Chief of the Allied Forces in the Southwest Pacific, at Allied Headquarters yesterday. The meeting lasted three hours. Australian Army Chief of Staff General Blamey and US Major General Sutherland were also present. Sutherland is MacArthur’s Chief of Staff.

### US Army Exercises in Panama Canal Zone

Lisbon, 21st (Haitong News Agency) – According to the US Army Department's announcement in Washington yesterday, large-scale exercises in the Panama Canal Zone, unprecedented since the start of the war, have concluded.

### Japan Issues Wartime Bonds Worth 550 Million Yen

Tokyo, 20th (Domei News Agency) – The Greater East Asia War Bonds, totaling 555 million yen, will be sold at post offices throughout the Japanese Empire from the 23rd of this month for twelve days. The bonds bear an interest rate of 3.5% and will be repaid in thirteen years.

### Provinces Report Good Harvests This Spring

Chongqing, 21st – According to reports from various locations received by the Ministry of Food, Minister Wang Shijie of the Central Propaganda Department hosted foreign journalists at 3:00 PM on the 21st, stating that most provinces have reported generally good harvests this spring. In Sichuan alone, in addition to wheat, the harvest of beans and other miscellaneous grains this spring is also satisfactory.

### Marshall Returns Home to Report on London Conference; British First Sea Lord Pound Arrives in the US; US Air Force Decides to Provide Effective Assistance to Britain

Washington, 20th (Havas) – US Army Chief of Staff General Marshall and Lend-Lease Administrator Hopkins, after returning from London, visited President Roosevelt today to report on the discussions with British military leaders. They also had lunch with the President at the White House. US Ambassador to Britain Winant was also present.

Washington, 21st (Reuters) – US Army Chief of Staff General Marshall was accompanied by four secret passengers on his return from Britain. It is now known that one of them is British First Sea Lord Admiral Pound. General Marshall also told reporters yesterday that his trip to Britain was "very satisfactory."

Washington, 20th (Havas) – US Army Chief of Staff General Marshall and Lend-Lease Administrator Hopkins have returned to the country after recently attending a meeting with the British General Staff in London. Military sources here commented on the results of their trip, saying that US participation in the European war will be limited to engaging in guerrilla warfare and accelerating the supply of military goods to Britain. The US is not yet ready for large-scale participation in the European war. In the future, US forces will only participate in "surprise attacks" on coastal areas of the European continent, and US aircraft will also participate in bombing European industrial centers; that’s all. In essence, the assistance that the US can provide to Britain will be mainly in the air force, because only aircraft can be transported to Britain in a short period of time, without worrying about the submarine threat. Most heavy bombers fly directly from the US to Britain, and this measure also benefits the Soviet Union. After US aircraft participate in the European war, the German army will have to transfer part of its aircraft from the Eastern Front to deal with them. At the same time, German wartime production will be greatly reduced due to the joint bombing by the British and American air forces. This situation will indirectly benefit the Soviet Union’s war of resistance.

### Hull's Remarks

Washington, 21st (Reuters) – US Secretary of State Hull returned to work yesterday after recovering from illness and stated that the Allied nations should use the slogan "Let's move forward immediately, don't wait for tomorrow." The United States' war efforts have achieved results in recent months, which is extremely gratifying. The production of munitions and materials has made particular progress. The United States' production volume is far greater than expected. Allied soldiers will be able to defeat the Axis powers sooner with these weapons.

### US Study Group Begins Work in India; Discusses Military Supply Issues with British Authorities

Indian Affairs Special

### The Composition of the Internal Structure

In this section, we are going to describe the internal structure of India. Originally, the so-called internal structure can include population, religion, economy, politics, and other aspects. However, the population, religion, economy, and other aspects have been generally discussed in other sections. Therefore, what this article will say is limited to the field of politics. Everyone knows that India is still a British colony. Reflected in the political aspect is the British rule on one hand, and the Indian people's struggle for freedom and independence on the other. We will leave the latter to be analyzed in the section "Political Parties and Important Figures," and here we will only describe the situation of British rule in India.

The British rule India mainly by dividing it into two parts: one is British India, directly governed by the Indian government; the other is the Indian states, ruled by local princes acting on the instructions of the British. The area of India totals 1,766,597 square miles, of which 1,087,204 square miles are directly administered by the British; the remaining 678,393 square miles are ruled by local princes. Roughly speaking, two-thirds belong to the former, and one-third belongs to the latter.

British India is vast in area, so the Indian government divides it into eleven large provinces and six small provinces. Among the important ones are Madras Province, Bombay Province, Bengal Province, Agra Province, Oudh Province, Punjab Province, Bihar Province, Orissa Province, Central Provinces, Assam Province, and so on. Each province has a governor who reports directly to the Indian government. The provincial government is the administrative organ of the province, and there is also a provincial council, which has legislative powers.

The Indian states are areas ruled by princes. Internal administration has a seemingly independent character, such as princes being able to have their own armies and collect taxes, but on the other hand, they must respect the suzerainty of the Indian government. At the same time, the Indian government is unwilling to relax its actual control over these princely states. In addition to sending political advisors who are stationed in the capital of the princely government to assist the prince in handling government affairs, it is also stipulated in the covenant that princes cannot form alliances with each other or enter into any treaties with foreign countries. Therefore, the Indian states under the jurisdiction of the princes are nominally independent, but in reality, they are still vassals. There are about 700 towns and cities in these areas, divided into several political units of different sizes. Larger ones, such as Hyderabad, Mysore, Baroda, Kashmir, Travancore, Rajputana, etc., have their own rulers (princes), and these rulers have direct contact with the Indian government. Smaller ones, even with only a few square miles of land, are also governed by their own princes, but these princes can only maintain contact with the provincial governments directly under the Indian government and cannot directly deal with the Indian government. The Bombay Provincial Government has as many as 354 such princely states under its jurisdiction. Madras Province has fewer, but there are also five.

The highest governing body in India, as mentioned above, is the Indian government. Its head is the Governor-General of India, so the Indian government is also commonly known as the Viceroy's Office. The Governor-General of India is nominally dispatched by the British monarch for a term of five years and holds all executive powers. The government organization is quite similar to the cabinet of a democratic country. It is divided into six departments: the Department of Finance, the Department of Education, Health and Land, the Department of Railways, Commerce and Religion, the Department of Industry and Labor, the Department of Interior, and the Department of Justice. Each department has a minister appointed directly by the British government for a term of five years. Recently, the number of cabinet members has increased compared to the past, but many are ministers without portfolio. In addition, there is a Commander-in-Chief of the Indian Army, who leads the British and Indian troops in India and presides over strategic matters. The Commander-in-Chief is also a member of the cabinet, but on strategic matters, he is not subject to the control of the Governor-General of India.

The Indian government can be regarded as the administrative organ of India, and there is also a legislative organ. The legislative organ can be divided into two houses: the lower house, also known as the Council of State, has sixty members, of whom thirty-four are elected and twenty-six are appointed by the government; the upper house, also known as the Legislative Assembly, has 144 members, of whom 104 are elected and 40 are appointed by the government. Government cabinet members are also qualified to be members of parliament, attending both houses, and their term of office is the same as that of general members, which is five years.

From this point of view, the internal organization of the Indian government seems to be no different from that of a general democratic country, but in reality, there are differences. First, although India has an administrative organ, all orders are issued in the name of the Governor-General, and in fact, the Governor-General bears full responsibility for them. Second, although India also has a legislative organ that deliberates on various important matters, the resolutions of the legislative organ do not necessarily have the power to compel the government to implement them. In other words, the will of the Governor-General of India can overturn the resolutions of the legislative organ. This is the special situation of the Indian government organization, which also shows the essence of British rule in India.

As for the response of the Indian people under this rule and the composition of the Indian people's revolutionary movement, we will discuss them in the section "Political Parties and Important Figures." This section will end here.

### France Determined to Faithfully Fulfill Amity and Understanding with Germany; Laval Clarifies Policy Guidelines; Yesterday Accompanied Finance Minister on a Trip to Paris

Vichy, 21st (Haitong News Agency) – French government leader Laval is scheduled to travel to Paris today with Finance Minister Bouthillier. Vichy, 21st (Haitong News Agency) – Laval departed from Vichy this morning, apparently for Paris. Laval will stay in Paris at the former presidential palace, the world-renowned "Champs-Élysées."

Vichy, 20th (Havas) – The new head of government, Laval, delivered a radio address to the nation today, clarifying future policy guidelines, declaring that he will promote an independent and autonomous diplomacy and strive for understanding and amity with Germany. He said, "I have been involved in political work for a long time and have experienced major difficult periods during France's life and death. I remember that in 1936, I resigned from the post of Prime Minister and left the country. At that time, France was strong and respected by everyone. However, in the following three years, some party leaders, ignorant of current affairs, acted solely on emotions and even conspired to harm the country. The greatest sin was declaring war on Germany, which eventually led to defeat and caused the country to suffer great pain, almost to the point of national collapse. Until recently, I was ordered by General Pétain to handle state affairs under his leadership, and I met you again here. Admiral Darlan will also represent the head of state and command the three armed forces. In the future, I will do everything possible to save France. I am not responsible for the misfortunes our country has encountered this time, and I am even more convinced of this now. The difficulties faced by the country and the government are still ongoing. In order to solve the various difficulties and reduce the suffering of the people, we must unite and work together. Although the government cannot promise you that prosperity will be restored soon, it will do its best to ensure that the general public can live without fear of lack of food and clothing. All French farmers must work hard to cultivate the land, and all workers should not be confused by the newly formed government. This reform is the result of the war. All my worker friends should know that Bolshevism only makes us poor and oppressed. The situation of the Russian people can serve as a warning. It is expected that socialism will prevail in the new Europe for a while, but this kind of socialism will be able to respect the nationality and wishes of each country. As for France today, not only is it suffering materially, but it is also feeling spiritually depressed because we have always loved freedom. Therefore, our first task in the future should be to strive to restore freedom, which can only be obtained by observing order and discipline. As for the future policy of the new government, what is the significance of my resuming state affairs this time? I hope the people will understand. I have been in politics for a long time and have always believed that the rapprochement between France and Germany is a prerequisite for European peace. This is my belief, deeply rooted, unbreakable, and I want to promote its realization whenever I have the opportunity, so as to establish understanding between the two countries and eliminate the reasons for the repeated wars between the two major nations in history, that is, the lack of understanding between each other. In short, in order to avoid such wars, we need a real French policy, an independent and autonomous policy that is not interfered with by any foreign country, because some countries have always found it beneficial to incite internal strife in our country, so that our country will never have peace."

First Meeting of the New French Cabinet

Vichy, 20th (Havas) – The new cabinet held its first meeting at the Sévigné Villa at 5:30 PM today, chaired by Marshal Pétain himself, who delivered a speech welcoming the head of government, Laval, and the new ministers. Then, Laval, on behalf of the new cabinet, thanked the head of state and assured him that he would be loyal to the head of state and the motherland. General Darlan, Commander-in-Chief of the French Army, Navy, and Air Force, also participated.

Darlan Broadcasts Encouragement to the Three Armed Forces

Vichy, 21st (Havas) – General Darlan, Commander-in-Chief of the French Army, Navy, and Air Force, read an instruction to the troops at the radio station this morning. The full text is as follows: "By order of Marshal Pétain, I have been appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Three Armed Forces, which is an unparalleled honor. The relationship between the Commander-in-Chief and the soldiers of the whole country has become closer since this moment. The most important thing in military service is discipline and patriotic enthusiasm. Comrades, the Commander-in-Chief will devote all his energy and time to military affairs from now on. I hope that all officers and soldiers will work with the Commander-in-Chief to obey the leadership of the head of state, follow the path of glory, and defend the motherland and all its territories. Long live the head of state! Long live France!"

Vichy, 20th (Havas) – According to the government announcement, Rear Admiral Bard has been appointed as the Chief of Staff of the French Army, Navy, and Air Force General Headquarters, and Minister Plenipotentiary Chiat has been appointed as the Head of the Secretariat. As for the rumor that the current Secretary-General of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Rochat, will succeed Rear Admiral Bérenger as the ambassador to Argentina, the official has neither confirmed nor denied it.

### The United States Will Issue a Statement to Vichy

Washington, 21st (Reuters) – Reuters reporters have learned that the United States' statement on Vichy's policy has been drafted since the 18th and is expected to be released today. The statement may reiterate the appeal to the French people in accordance with President Roosevelt's speech to the French people in May last year. President Roosevelt said that cooperation between Vichy and Germany was considered unimaginable. Diplomats believe that Laval's posturing in trying to maintain peaceful relations with the warring country is also possible, because he can use it to deceive the French people. He has done his best in this regard, but with little success, and then he will cooperate with Germany. But this attitude cannot deceive the American people.

### Soviet Forces on the Central Front Launch a Fierce Offensive; 18 Miles from Smolensk; Fierce Battles on the Northern Front

Stockholm, Sweden, 20th (Havas) – According to Eastern Front news, fierce battles have taken place near Leningrad and the Finnish front in the past two days.

German war reports claim that the surrounded Red Army in the Leningrad war zone has attempted to break through again under the cover of tanks and field artillery, but ultimately failed.

Berlin, 21st (Haitong News Agency) – A German expert yesterday issued the following supplementary war report to a Haitong News Agency reporter: The Eastern Front continues to thaw, and many sections of the Northern Front are covered with snow and water. In this situation, the German army still took the offensive and continued to make progress.

### Rent Should Still Be Converted to Original Rent Amount After Changing to Collect New Currency; Collecting All New Currency is Equivalent to Increasing Rent in Disguise; Authorities Dispatch Personnel to Thoroughly Investigate to Prevent Circumventing the Prohibition; Some Landlords Have Cancelled Previous Agreements and Still Collect Old Currency

The Shanghai Times reported yesterday (20th) that major real estate companies in the city have notified their tenants that rent will continue to be collected in legal tender (法幣), and new leases will also specify legal tender as the basis. The tense situation between real estate companies and tenants in recent weeks has eased. Other real estate companies that want to collect Reserve Notes (儲鈔) will continue to collect in this currency, but it must be converted based on the current exchange rate with legal tender. As for tenants who have mistakenly paid rent at the equivalent value of Reserve Notes as legal tender due to misunderstandings, the amount of the market premium will be returned to the tenants and deducted from their April rent, following the mediation measures of the municipal authorities.

Illegal Profiteering, Tenant Resistance

The new dispute between the Dihua Company and its tenants began at the beginning of this month. Because the equal value of legal tender and Reserve Notes was cancelled at the end of March, real estate companies immediately notified tenants that rent must be paid in Reserve Notes, but without any discount based on the exchange rate. The municipal authorities then announced that all taxes and fees must be converted at the exchange rate and paid in Reserve Notes, and landlords were prohibited from increasing rents before the end of March. Landlords used these two factors as reasons to demand the same amount of Reserve Notes when collecting rent, causing a great uproar among tenants, who accused the landlords of this arbitrary action as illegal profiteering, leading to disputes between the two sides.

Dispatch Personnel to Investigate and Prevent Rent Increases

This led to the establishment of a special committee by the municipal authorities to thoroughly investigate the matter. As a result of extensive investigations, it was found that some real estate companies' requests for rent increases were unfounded. It is expected that the authorities will soon continue to implement adjustments to eliminate misunderstandings about the regulations on the use of Reserve Notes and prevent some unscrupulous landlords from outwardly complying with but inwardly violating the prohibition on rent increases.

Eagerly Awaiting Firm Policies from the Authorities

The English-language "China Press" reported that, after inquiring with municipal authorities and the real estate industry, there is still no general and practical solution to the issue of rent collection in legal tender and Reserve Notes in the city. Although the Shanghai Municipal Council of the International Settlement and the French Municipal Council's Rent Committee have reportedly been discussing this issue, a solution is not expected until the entire currency issue is clarified. According to sources, the rent situation in the city is currently in a state of flux. Many real estate companies are currently collecting Reserve Notes, while others are planning to switch to collecting Reserve Notes from May 1st, and still others continue to collect legal tender. All parties are currently awaiting the authorities to announce a definite policy on this matter.

Rent Currently Falls into Four Categories

Furthermore, according to a French Municipal Council official's response to reporters, real estate companies generally still accept legal tender for those who have leases specifying rent to be paid in legal tender. However, tenants have been notified that future new rents will be collected in Reserve Notes. Whether or not Reserve Notes can be collected at that time will depend on the currency situation at that time. Real estate companies that collect rent monthly seem to have been divided into four categories: 1) Those who have never demanded to collect Reserve Notes; 2) Those who had made this request and then revoked it; 3) Those who have notified that they will collect Reserve Notes in the near future (mostly starting from May 1st); 4) Those who are already collecting Reserve Notes.

Complex Situation Awaiting Development

Thus, the situation is quite complex, and if there are new developments in the currency situation, this situation may be completely changed. For example, if it is later decided that all rents should be converted at the exchange rate of Reserve Notes to legal tender, then tenants who have already paid in Reserve Notes can reduce their payments in the future according to the exchange rate. A spokesman for the Shanghai Municipal Council stated this morning (21st) that the Council may issue a notice on this matter soon.

### Bank Joint Reserve Association Adjusts Cash Funds, Providing Reasonable Support to Various Banks and Firms, Implemented Starting Yesterday

As the cash funds in the city have been relatively tight recently, exchanging cash for checks and bills of exchange requires a premium of around 300 yuan per 10,000 yuan. Speculators have also taken advantage of this to make profits. In order to adjust among its members, the Bank Joint Reserve Association has prepared a considerable amount of cash to provide to its members in reasonable amounts. The association will determine the amount to be supplied to each member based on their receipts and payments. Except for the money houses, which will be supplied by the association to the money house reserve, the association will not directly deal with each firm. All banks that have dealings with the association can open a check account or check within this week according to the amount set by the association and exchange cash at the association. This matter was implemented yesterday, and the check premium in the market has been reduced.

### Citizen ID Cards to Be Issued Next Month; Household Survey Nears Completion

In order to implement the Baojia (保甲) system, the Shanghai Municipal Council's Police Department began surveying households in the International Settlement on February 15th of this year. It is now known that this survey work will be completed by the end of this month. The Police Department will also conduct a thorough review and verification based on the survey results before issuing citizen ID cards. The issuance period is expected to be in mid-May. The citizen ID card will include information such as the specific Bao and Jia (甲) to which the holder belongs, current address, name, age, and occupation. Residents must carry this card with them after receiving it for identification purposes in case of emergency. Therefore, after the issuance of this card, it will be possible to prevent the entry of undesirable elements into the settlement, the prevalence of thieves is expected to be slightly curbed, and the long-awaited system of allocating food according to population will be gradually implemented based on this. As for the French Concession, preparations for the Baojia system will be carried out in parallel with the International Settlement, with mutual cooperation and support in all aspects. The household survey is proceeding smoothly, and citizen ID cards and the system of allocating food according to population are also in the planning stages. Although some deny that the French authorities intend to organize self-defense groups, in the near future, the French Concession will also have similar and sound organizations, or expand and strengthen existing organizations such as neighborhood patrols. In short, the authorities of the two concessions are in complete agreement on the principle of promoting the Baojia system, with only slight differences in implementation methods and progress.

### Shanghai Jimin Hospital Established; Board Meeting Held Yesterday

The First Refugee Hospital at 240 Xizang Road is a well-established relief hospital in Shanghai. In the past, in addition to providing relief to refugees, it also provided as much relief as possible to general impoverished patients. Over the years, countless people have been saved. It was then closed down by the Refugee Association. Leaders from all walks of life, in view of the hospital's relief achievements and the current large number of local poor and sick people in urgent need of help, reorganized the hospital into the Shanghai Jimin Hospital, which was established on the 1st of this month to continue providing relief. Yesterday afternoon, a plenary board meeting was held at the YMCA on Jing'an Temple Road to discuss ways to raise relief funds. More than 20 directors, including Lan Ting and Yuan Ludeng, attended. The following resolutions were passed: 1) Request the Refugee Relief Association to continue to allocate assistance to relief funds; 2) Print donation books and ask each director to solicit donations separately, with a target of 200,000 yuan; 3) Hire more than 30 enthusiastic social leaders as directors to increase relief efforts.

### Bai Jiao's Solo Exhibition Opens Today

### Shipping Industry Gradually Becoming Active; Merchant Ships Eagerly Seeking to Resume Navigation; Haiyun Changed to Zhoushan to Start Sailing Soon; Gaodeng Renamed Dafeng to Sail to Northern Jiangsu

The situation of merchant ships has changed repeatedly since August 13th. Recently, several merchant ships flying the German flag have changed flags, which has been reported in the newspapers many times. The Haifu, a merchant ship of the German firm Lehe & Co., has been purchased by Yamashita Kisen Co. for 1.6 million yuan in legal tender. A new Zhoushan Company has been formed, and the ship's name has also been changed to "Zhoushan". The capital of the company is borne equally by the old and new shareholders of the ship. The route has not yet been determined. It is said that it will sail to Xiamen or Tainan/Taipei. It is also rumored that it will be affiliated with the China Company to sail to Dinghai Shenjiamen, and it is also said that it will sail to Ningbo first. According to the shipping industry, if it joins the Shanghai-Ningbo line, it must entrust the East Asia Shipping Association to act as an agent. It is said that Yamashita Company is coming forward, and it is also in progress. Therefore, it is still uncertain where the ship will sail, and it must be docked to inspect the bottom of the ship, so the opening date is still far away. It is also said that the Moufu was sailing to Wenzhou and was detained by the Japanese Navy in the Zhoushan Islands. It has been more than a year. It is said that a certain celebrity has recently negotiated with the Japanese side, and there is now talk of release. In the future, the nationality will also be changed. The Gaodeng of the German firm Lulin & Co. is also changing its flag and has been renamed "Dafeng", sailing to various ports in northern Jiangsu. All procedures have reportedly been completed and will be sailing within days. The Hana, a ship of the German Far East Shipping Company, has a similar tonnage to the Haifu and is currently under repair. It is also planned to change its flag and participate in the sailing on the eastern Zhejiang line. Various procedures are underway. It is said that the Deping of the Italian firm Zhongyi Company is also considering resuming navigation.

Engel and Newburg, engineers from the former Madi Motor Company, are said to be the earliest designers of this type of car. Many of them are already in use on the market, and they plan to manufacture them in large quantities in the future.

### Union Bank Supplies Cash, Check Discount Rate Drops Significantly

The Bank Union Reserve Committee of this city has decided to supply cash ranging from 1.05 million to ease recent cash shortages by accounting for a member's deposit and withdrawal situation. Member banks can apply for a cash withdrawal through the Union, by submitting a written request or check, and cash holdings will be recorded. Supply to privately owned banks will be handled through the Privately Owned Bank Reserve, but not directly with individual businesses. As a result, yesterday the check discount rate fell sharply from 15 to 7 or 8, eventually between 5 and 10 yuan per 1,000 yuan. The reserve note premium rose to 0.29 and checks were exchanged at 0.3 to 0.32.

### Tianjin Merchants Buy a Large Quantity of Gold, Price Reaches Nearly 20,000 Yuan

Yesterday, the price of gold on the open market continued to rise, reaching the 20,000 yuan mark. It is said that the price of gold in Tianjin is around 22,000 yuan, and the Tianjin merchants are secretly buying. Moreover, the gold shops continued to buy after buying on the previous day, and the market continued to be good. Cash houses and securities firms also raised prices and bought aggressively. The number of gold bars available after registration and control was extremely small, and the price either did not rise or rose uncontrollably. The market sentiment was very strong. From the morning, the initial price per bar (ten taels) was 200 yuan higher, at 18,350 yuan. Cash houses, gold shops, and securities houses bought in, and the price rose to 18,850 yuan. Another Yuhao sold it, and the price fell slightly at noon to 18,600 yuan. In the afternoon, two gold shops and two securities houses and gold shops raised prices and bought aggressively, and the price suddenly broke through the 19,000 yuan mark. Four bars were traded at 19,300 or 400 yuan. Finally, there were buyers at 19,500 yuan, and the sellers called prices much higher than the purchase price, which was 1,350 yuan higher than the previous day's price. The market atmosphere was strong, with a difference of 1,150 yuan.

The selling price of gold jewelry in gold shops was 50 yuan higher in the morning and 100 yuan higher in the afternoon at Daxin and other shops, at 2,050 yuan (200 yuan reduction for purchases). Tael silver was priced at 18 yuan, and black market price was 13.8-9 yuan. The price of silver coins also rose to 8.6-7 yuan.

### Gold Pound Rises to 10 Yuan

Yesterday's foreign exchange market, British and American gold pounds each rose by 20 yuan, the former to 460 yuan, and the latter to 470 yuan. US dollar bills retreated slightly to 32-33 yuan. The rising trend of Hong Kong bills has been curbed, with small bills still at 4.9 yuan and large bills still at 4.8 yuan. Military bills did not fluctuate much, and the final price was 7.25 yuan.

### Government Bond Trading Psychology; Almost Incomprehensible

The black market for government bonds was increasingly distorted yesterday, almost incomprehensible. All parties were selling, just to get rid of them, and buying just to make a deal, losing their minds for a time. By the time the deal was done, and the price was compared, they were all depressed. For example, Type C was particularly high, rising by almost one yuan, and the closing price was 60 yuan, while Type B was lower than Type C by 0.3 yuan, which was already absurd. Type E was only at 55 yuan, 5 yuan less than Type C, which was also irrational. When the reactive adjustment comes, they will laugh silently. Yesterday, the majority of sellers were Tong Kang and Tong Li, and the amount was extremely large. The rest were Shunli, Yongchang Tongji, Yongkang, etc., but the amount of sales was limited. The majority of buyers were Hu Heji, Yongkang, and Xie Kang. The rest, such as Tongshun, Qianyi, Yuxing, Zhongfu, Lianhe, Hengyu, and Hongxing, were secondary. Other transactions of 350,000 yuan were not counted. The market was not without a surge in sales, and the appetite of buyers was not small. In this way, they competed with each other, and one side would eventually fail, and then there would be a one-sided market. As a result of the market, Type C rose by 0.95 yuan, Type A and Type D only rose by 0.1 yuan, Type E was unchanged, and Type B was still down by 0.3 yuan. The chaotic situation can be seen in the closing price. The total turnover was 1.56 million. A brief table is listed below:

Category | Highest | Lowest | Closing | Compared to Previous Day

Unified A | 66.00 | 65.20 | 65.40 | Up 0.10

Unified B | 60.00 | 59.00 | 55.70 | Down 0.20

Unified C | 60.00 | 58.50 | 60.00 | Up 0.95

Unified D | 55.50 | 51.00 | 53.10 | Up 0.10

Unified E | 55.70 | 54.60 | 55.00 | Unchanged

### Speculation Concentrated on Shuangma Factory Orders; Market Fluctuations Are Rapid

The cotton yarn market, after rising for many days, is showing signs of calming down. At the same time, some profit-takers are selling, so the market is stable.

### The Rise of Eastern Cloth Gains Momentum

Factory Cloth: Yesterday, influenced by the frenzied surge in eastern cloth, various cloths saw new peaks again. However, the majority was driven by speculative trading and non-industry hoarding. Twelve-pound Fugui Fine Cloth opened at 165 yuan in the morning, later rising to 170 yuan. Spot goods opened at 204.5 yuan in the morning, subsequently rising to 208 yuan. Dapeng Fine Cloth was at 215 yuan, sixteen-pound Earth Thick Cloth at 245 yuan, eight-pound Zhenzhong Thick Cloth at 118 yuan, Peach Blossom Ladies' Cloth at 330 yuan, Light Color at 255 yuan, and Longevity Fu Silk at 6.75 yuan, all with active trading.

Eastern Cloth: Yesterday's spot market saw an astonishing rise due to the frenzied boosting and rampant buying by securities speculators and cotton yarn merchants. It was truly rare. Leading Fine Cloth had broken through the 250 yuan mark, and Four Gentlemen Serge red orders were approaching 8 yuan per yard. The difference compared to actual sales of spot goods was a huge 7-8 jiao per yard, entirely driven by speculation and lacking any proper order. New orders for Leading Fine Cloth opened at 245.5 yuan in the morning, closing at 246 yuan at noon. In the afternoon, it opened at 250 yuan, reaching a high of 254 yuan, and closing at 253.5 yuan in the evening.

### ### Bette Davis Elected Movie Queen

— New Film

Although the world is shrouded in the clouds of war, everything in Hollywood remains as usual, only with a slightly tenser atmosphere. As in the past year, the rankings of films and actors' performances are evaluated on schedule and announced successively. Due to transportation issues, the news we receive is not as detailed as in previous years. It is particularly worth noting that the female star Bette Davis has been elected as the Movie Queen of 1941, receiving unparalleled honor once again.

There is no need to introduce Bette Davis's artistry here, as everyone knows it. Although she has been acting on screen for quite some time, her acting skills have continuously improved with the times, unlike others whose careers are short-lived. She has won the Academy Award for Best Actress three times in a very short period, which is even rarer, and now she has been elected Movie Queen, truly adding glory to glory. Her receiving accolades and being elected Movie Queen is not accidental. The main reason is that she is diligent and tireless in studying film art day and night, without any arrogance. Even in her life off-screen, she is unlike other female stars, showing no signs of romantic involvement, and is rarely seen in social gatherings, truly deserving the title of "keeping herself pure."

Now, Bette Davis is over thirty years old and has been in the film industry for ten years. Logically, she should be declining, but the opposite is true; she is becoming even more famous. Looking back at the history of Hollywood films, there are not many female stars like her, right? Recently, she hasn't starred in many films, only three or five each year, but every time we see her films, we always find her appearance, her acting skills, everything about her endearing. Especially her seriousness in acting, without any pretense, is probably the main reason she has become a generation of artists.

### A Young Director from Humble Beginnings

— Yu Yi

Norma Shearer, a pillar of MGM Studios, had a husband named Irving Thalberg, who in his youth was an important film producer, renowned in Hollywood. In middle age, his position became even higher, no less than the soul of MGM, and he had become one of the leading producers in the American film industry. Unfortunately, illness took his life, and the film industry universally mourned, lamenting the rarity of such a talented young man.

A few years later, Hollywood has discovered a rising star, capable and promising, generally regarded as comparable to Irving Thalberg in his youth. This person's surname is Witney, and his given name is William. He is twenty-three years old and already serves as a director at Republic Pictures. His recent work, "King of the Cowboys," is currently showing at the Dahua Theater.

Witney's current position is entirely a reward for his hard work and self-motivation. Two years ago, he was still working as an office boy in the writing room, using the convenience of his position to learn the various skills of the film industry. His background can be said to be extremely humble. At that time, because of his diligent work, he was appreciated by the producer and transferred to the editing room, first as an assistant, then promoted to editor. In his spare time, he diligently studied photography, angles, and lighting techniques. Before long, his artistic achievements were significant, and his knowledge and experience were very rich. Through the producer's recognition and promotion, he was appointed as assistant director, making many new contributions. If he can continue to work hard in the future, there will be even more meaningful works than "King of the Cowboys" to come out, and his future is truly limitless.

### Springtime in the Pear Garden: Recent Developments

— Master of the Zhenlin Study

Dalin, the younger brother of the famous Dan actor Huang Yulin, is naturally intelligent. He accompanies his brother on the Qin, and is highly regarded in Tianjin. Recently, through the introduction of Wan Zihe, a celebrity in the Beijing opera world, he has been apprenticed to the famous Qin master Xu Lanyuan (who used to accompany Tan Xinpei and Mei Lanfang).

Ma Yunliang's troupe has a stronger drawing power in Beijing than Tan Fuying and Cheng Yanqiu. In the autumn, they will head south to perform. It is widely rumored that they will invite the famous Dan actor Huang Yulin to join them as a collaborator.

Since returning to Shanghai last year, Yan Jupeng has not performed, spending his days in leisure with calligraphy and painting.

### Silver Gate Theater Opens

The New World Silver Gate Theater was founded by Yu Yuchang, Shi Dekang, Zhao Lianfang, Zhang Gengtang, and others, and is responsible for improving the Siming Wenxi opera, known as the Improved Yongju Opera. It opened on April 19th, inaugurated by the Shanghai celebrity Huang Zenshi, with the scissors-cutting ceremony performed by Ms. Jin Cuiyu and Ms. Jin Cuixiang.

### Riding the Storm Together

— He Jia Zhi

(3) A Guest Arrives

The next day, Xiaowei continued to hear Cuizhen's cries, waking Weicheng. Weicheng was waiting for Fei Changhe's arrival. He had asked Second Mrs. Ye, and there was not much money in the family, fearing that it would not satisfy Fei Changhe's desires. But he thought that Fei Changhe would not really come to ask him for all of Cuizhen's family's food expenses. This day, the clear sun shone on the entire courtyard, and the weather was warming up. The incense burning before First Mrs. Ye's spirit floated out a wisp, lightly and slowly. A magpie came over and asked, "Young Master, there's a lot of mud on your shoes. Would you like to change into a pair of old shoes and take off the shoes on your feet for me to brush?" Weicheng bent down and saw that there was indeed a lot of mud on his white cloth shoes. He asked, "Who told you to ask?" The magpie said, "Miss Cuizhen." Weicheng said, "Let it be. We're in mourning, so there's no point in being too neat."

He walked outside with his hands behind his back. Before he reached the second gate, Axing brought a person in. Axing was in front. Weicheng thought it must be Fei Changhe and hurriedly looked behind Axing. Ah! It was Ms. Chen Guofang, who had made an appointment on the night of the storm to visit around the New Year. Guofang's arrival was within Weicheng's expectations, but they couldn't help but be taken aback when they met. Guofang was wearing a black thick woolen coat, a colorful scarf around her neck, a qipao that reached above her ankles, and a pair of black leather shoes with many holes. Guofang took a step closer and, without saying anything else, just asked, "What's wrong?" Weicheng said, "My mother passed away!" After saying this, he couldn't say anything more. He just reached out and shook hands with Guofang. Guofang said, "My brother is also sick and can't come. Ah, how quickly things change?" Weicheng just shook his head, almost letting his tears fall. Axing said, "Why don't you invite this lady to sit in the reception room?" These words reminded Weicheng. (55)
