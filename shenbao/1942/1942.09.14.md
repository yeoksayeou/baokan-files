### German Troops Break Through Soviet Defenses South of Stalingrad, Planes Bomb the Entire City, Flames Light Up the Sky, Soviets Use Three New Types of Weapons in Combat

Berlin, 13th (Domei News Agency)

General Bock of Germany, after exerting all his strength to fiercely attack Stalingrad for nine days, his mechanized and motorized infantry units have now overcome Soviet resistance and stormed into the southern part of the city. The German High Command announced this this afternoon and revealed that after continuous fierce bombing of the city by a large number of German aircraft for several days, the German army finally entered the city. It is reported that many fortifications in Stalingrad were destroyed by German aircraft, and large parts of the city are ablaze. The German High Command also announced that a Soviet offensive north of Stalingrad to relieve the city was repelled.

Stockholm, 13th (Domei News Agency)

Around Stalingrad, both German attacks and Soviet counterattacks have been extremely fierce, so the battlefield is unpredictable and changes rapidly. Currently, each German offensive mobilizes three infantry divisions and 300 bombers. The German army began large-scale night raids on Friday. Last night, the Soviet capital radio station reported the situation on the front line, summarizing it as "the situation is tense." According to German reports, in addition to occupying several important areas north of the city and encircling a large number of Red Army troops, they have also attacked a strong city on the Stalingrad front. The name of the city was not mentioned.

Berlin, 13th (Haitong News Agency)

The German army continues to make progress in operations in Stalingrad. A strong Soviet position north of the city has been broken through by two German divisions. Other German combat units are engaged in bloody battles with the enemy. Between the Volga River and the Don River, the enemy, aided by a large number of tanks, launched a counterattack, which was repelled by German artillery. On the east bank of the Volga River, the Soviets have deployed fresh infantry and tank brigades to participate in the fighting, aided by aircraft and artillery. The fighting is quite fierce, with both sides exerting all their strength. The Volga Bay is an important strategic location and a key position in the southern and central sections of the Soviet front. There are also large military factories in this area, so it is also very important in terms of war economy.

Somewhere on the border of Ukraine, 12th (Havas News Agency)

Neutral observers here originally thought that the Red Army was in dire straits weeks ago, especially in the Krasnoarmeysk area, where the situation was most critical. Therefore, most people expected that the Red Army could hold Stalingrad for only a few days at most. Unexpectedly, the city's defenders have continued to resolutely resist the German army for days, and the German army has repeatedly failed to capture the city. This is deeply surprising. The reason is that the Red Army has built solid and superior fortifications around Stalingrad, causing great difficulties for the attackers. For example, the Romanian newspaper Universul reported that the area around Stalingrad has become a strong defensive line, guarded by elite Siberian troops. Although the German army and its allies are elite and good at fighting, they still need to exert great effort to gradually advance.

Stockholm, 13th (Havas News Agency)

According to reports from German war correspondents, the Red Army is fighting a desperate battle to defend these two steel cities. The bravery of the resistance and the soldiers' disregard for death are almost unbelievable. At the same time, the Red Army is using the following three new types of military equipment to defend Stalingrad: (1) Bombers with very thick fuselages, called "ironclad aircraft" by German soldiers. Their main task is to bomb the ground equipment of rear airfields and German aircraft. (2) Suicide pilots: Soviet pilots, fully loaded with ammunition, land in the center of German positions and German concentration points, with the ammunition and the aircraft exploding simultaneously. (3) Artillery units on the banks of the Volga River are so numerous that they surprise the German army. In this battle for Stalingrad, both sides have suffered significant losses in terms of manpower and material resources. Stalin previously defended Tsaritsyn city during the civil war and ultimately won. Now, Stalingrad is called Tsaritsyn city, and he has ordered all bridges over the Volga River to be destroyed, so that [Stalingrad has only one way out, which is through the German defense line].

Berlin, 12th (Havas News Agency)

According to military sources here, German air fleets yesterday flew to the Stalingrad front to attack Soviet armored vehicle convoys waiting to go to the front, destroying many vehicles and dispersing the rest. In addition, German aircraft bombed the Astrakhan-Baskunchak railway line, destroying many sections of the tracks, and several trains carrying military equipment were seen catching fire and burning.

### The Volga Campaign Encounters Formidable Opponents, Germany Acknowledges Great Difficulties in the Battle

Berlin, 12th (Havas News Agency)

The German News Agency recently issued a message stating that the battle for Stalingrad requires the continuous deployment of fresh troops, so no progress can be expected every day. This battle has now become an encirclement. All Soviet armored vehicle convoys and defensive works must be destroyed by our flamethrowers and hand grenades under the cover of artillery and aircraft to be effective. Every time the Red Army is forced to retreat, new positions are prepared in the rear to continue resistance, preventing our infantry and engineers from continuing to advance. However, the Red Army has suffered heavy losses in manpower, so its counterattacks in other countries are not as fierce as before. [Currently, all efforts must be focused on defending Stalingrad].

Berlin, 13th (Huanan News Agency)

General Dentsov, a Soviet expert recently captured in Stalingrad, said that the deep and high-built Stalingrad fortress is so extensive and well-defended that even experienced military personnel cannot fathom it. The construction of this great project is based on the experience gained in this war and built with the latest technology. Therefore, the fortress has become the world's most perfect defensive project. Its bunkers are built with thick steel plates and reinforced concrete. Most of the artillery installed in them has been installed in recent months, so it is unknown to the enemy. Even reconnaissance planes cannot detect its secrets. Steel-plated tunnels are built between each artillery emplacement, and a battery is set up every 500 meters. The ground is mined within several miles of the front of the fortress.

### Price Controls Are Not a Permanent Policy, Emphasis on Commodity Circulation, Shops Waiting and Seeing and Delaying Price Cuts Will Be Punished, Inland Prices Will Tend to Be Consistent with Shanghai Prices

### Arrangements for Supply of Woolen Fabrics, Cotton, Soap, Candles, etc. Have Been Made

Reliable sources with connections to various authorities and price control agencies yesterday solemnly revealed that two weeks have passed since the implementation of the new countermeasures for price management. While some companies and shops directly supervised by the relevant authorities have successively reduced prices to a considerable extent, most are still taking a wait-and-see attitude. The authorities can hardly tolerate such delaying tactics. Today, they must once again give warning and advice to general shops that those who have not yet complied with the order to reduce prices should automatically make appropriate adjustments in the shortest possible time. In terms of implementation, slight adjustments can be made with reference to cost increases and decreases, but fairness and reasonableness are the most basic principles.

Organizing a Special Price Countermeasures Committee

As for the implementation details of the new price management countermeasures, after consultation by various relevant authorities, they have generally been finalized. However, because price controls require the cooperation of all parties, price countermeasures will be organized in various parts of Central China. The Shanghai area is particularly important. Such an organization will also be established in Shanghai, which will include the authorities of the Asia Development Board, the Japanese Consulate General, the Shanghai Municipal Council, the French Municipal Council, and areas outside the settlements, etc., in order to concentrate efforts to deal with prices and material problems here. It has been learned that Okazaki Katsuo, the General Manager of the Shanghai Municipal Council, has previously revealed the possibility and inevitability of organizing such a price countermeasures committee. In the future, all matters related to prices and violations will be handled by this centralized agency.

Price Limits Adopt a Focus-Oriented Approach

It is learned that the relevant authorities have set a basic principle for future price controls, that is, price countermeasures will focus on maintaining fair prices. At the same time, the actual situation in all aspects should be considered to maintain fair and stable prices. Fixed and unchanging low prices should not be adhered to, as this would hinder the smooth flow of materials and instead promote hoarding and speculation. In addition, price management countermeasures should adopt a focus-oriented approach and be gradually implemented, starting with major cities. Materials should first focus on daily necessities, exports, and important materials related to resource development. The recent permission from the Asia Development Board for major department stores on the island to increase prices is based on this intention, because without this, merchants and civilians cannot be reassured.

Inspecting Shops, Pay Attention to Two Things

Okazaki, the General Manager of the Shanghai Municipal Council, recently told reporters from the Japanese-language Continental News that the overall price situation in the International Settlement can be described as satisfactory after the implementation of the control measures. The authorities pay attention to two points when inspecting shops: 1. Whether the current price in Central Reserve Bank notes is half of the old legal tender price between May 26 and 28. 2. If the current price in Central Reserve Bank notes exceeds half the number, then check whether there is a significant increase in its expenses or whether the price increase has been approved by the authorities. Regarding the provisions of daily necessities, reasonable price levels are stipulated for the items. Some merchants are expected to negotiate and agree on prices themselves, and there are also various items for which the authorities suggest standard selling prices and allow a certain degree of correction. The agreed prices should be formulated by the trade associations and jointly followed by the merchants.

Main Purpose of Implementing Controls

When asked whether the current price restrictions will continue to a certain period or will slow down production, Okazaki replied that he does not consider price controls to be a permanent policy. The purpose of this policy is to re-adjust the prices between Shanghai and inland areas. Recently, inland areas have had a tendency towards economic self-sufficiency, because Shanghai's prices are so high that it is difficult to transport goods from Shanghai to inland areas. Under these circumstances, Shanghai's prices must be lowered and inland prices raised to the same level to remove obstacles to the smooth flow of goods. In order to achieve successful price controls, it is necessary to obtain a sufficient supply of goods. The Shanghai Municipal Council intends to control the supply of several essential goods. However, the scope of control will be limited as much as possible. Speaking of the allocation of woolen fabrics, the Council is preparing to meet this year's needs. Regarding the supply of cotton, it is currently consulting with merchants. The Council is also negotiating with qualified authorities on the matter of soap and candles.

### Money Exchange Shop Business is Slow and Turnover is Not Smooth

It is Expected That At Least Twenty Shops Will Be Liquidated

The Mid-Autumn settlement period is approaching, and many money exchange shops in the city are experiencing financial difficulties. At least twenty shops will be forced to liquidate during the Mid-Autumn settlement. Money exchange shops once flourished, but the prosperity did not last long. After the authorities banned market speculation, the business of money exchange shops plummeted, and the bleak situation was unprecedented in the history of money exchange trade. Those without substantial reserves are inevitably forced to close down in the short term.

### Banks and Money Shops Should Make Loans More Flexible, But Must Establish Collateral Agreements

Banks and money shops should grant flexible loans to various industrial and commercial sectors that have legitimate needs for funds. However, the examination of loan applications should be strict to avoid the use of loans to promote speculation and hoarding. 1) For mortgage loans secured by commodities, banks should enter into contracts with borrowers in accordance with the collateral loan agreement methods stipulated by the Bankers Association, and money shops should enter into separate agreements in accordance with the collateral agreements passed by the Money Shop Association. The collateral provided must be strictly reviewed. Daily necessities and items related to people's livelihood should be rejected. The pricing and discount rates for qualified commodities should be carefully assessed. The mortgage period should comply with laws and regulations and be limited to three months, after which the borrower should be ordered to redeem the collateral without extension. However, this does not apply to special cases that have been specially approved. 2) For overdrafts, banks and money shops should order borrowers to provide a guarantee to repay the full amount within the guarantee period. For overdrafts of larger amounts, the legitimate use must be stated, such as purchasing raw materials or adding machinery. Banks and money shops may refuse overdrafts if there is no sufficient reason. 3) For credit loans, the end of April and the end of October are the comparison periods. Banks and money shops should first carefully investigate the creditworthiness and purpose of the borrower. After approval, a credit loan agreement must be signed, and a reputable firm must guarantee the repayment. If the borrower cannot repay the loan when due, the guarantor will be responsible for repayment. The strictness of the examination is greater than that for mortgage loans. Because credit loans are too risky, banks and money shops have been making efforts to tighten them.

### Shen Bao Readers' Scholarship Fund Received Donation Report Yesterday

It is heard that the YWCA has decided to extend the exhibition for two days to popularize maternal and infant hygiene knowledge. Women from all walks of life should not miss this opportunity.

### The City's Coal Needs Will Be Transported by Railway

The English "Times" reported yesterday that a representative of the Shanghai Coal and Other United Associations, the fuel distribution center in this city, told reporters that the company currently has a sufficient supply of coal, which can meet Shanghai's needs for several months. He also pointed out that coal transportation to Shanghai is now assisted by the railway, which can import coal steadily. Its efficiency is much faster and safer than water transportation, which can ensure that there is no shortage of coal. It is said that coal prices will eventually have a great possibility to be lowered in the near future, and the general public will regard the current prices as ridiculously high.

### Special Return-to-Hometown Permits Will Be Issued All Day Starting Today

The office distributing return-to-hometown permits in the Public Works Department Building on Hankou Road will resume full-day office hours starting today. It is understood that the authorities have canceled the afternoon permit application time since the beginning of the summer this year because there were fewer people returning to their hometowns during the summer vacation. Now that the season has entered early autumn, it is expected that the number of people applying to return to their hometowns will be higher, so it is necessary to restore full-day visa services.

### Tong Yuchun Teahouse Manager Accused of Embezzlement

Tong Yuchun Teahouse, located at 543 Nanjing Road, was entrusted by Zhu Jieren to Huang Baohua for operation. The owner, Hartung Foreign Firm, wanted to take it back for its own use when the lease contract expired two years ago. Huang Baohua pleaded with Ma Wenlin to help invest and cooperate. Ma negotiated with Hartung Foreign Firm several times before obtaining the right to renew the lease and the right to make major repairs, costing more than 30,000 yuan. Since its opening in the first month of last year, Ma Wenlin was elected as the general manager and Huang Baohua as the manager. Ma accounted for three-quarters of the monthly profits. However, since January of this year, Huang Baohua has concealed the monthly profits and has not reported them, embezzling all of them. He also changed the "Lin Ji" brand to "Rong Ji," falsely claiming that the teahouse has now been returned to Zhu Jieren and entrusted to Huang for management. Ma Wenlin believes that Huang's actions constitute embezzlement of profits, estimated at 3,763.10 yuan in new currency. He secretly hired lawyers Li Weibin and Cai Guoxiang to file a criminal lawsuit against Huang Baohua. Huang was summoned once and was ordered to be detained due to the suspicion of a serious crime. Shi Yongzhen (the teahouse's accountant), a witness invited by Huang, was also suspected of perjury and was sent to the procuratorate for investigation. After the prosecutor opened the court for interrogation, Shi was allowed to be released on bail of 200 yuan pending verification. Tong Yuchun Teahouse has recently been taken over by Min Wenlin.

### Two Rice Shops Involved in Lawsuit Over Funds

Min Jingsheng, the owner of Hengkang Rice Shop at 89 Rue Bael, French Concession, recently filed a criminal self-accusation against Yu Wangyouqing, a fellow trader at Dafengxie Rice Shop at 78 Rue de Cognac, for defrauding a large sum of money. It is said that in November of last year, Wang urgently needed to borrow 10,000 yuan in cash from a merchant by mortgaging three checks from the Guohua Silk Industry Bank. Unexpectedly, the checks were returned when they were presented to the two banks for cashing upon maturity. Wang denied the debt when he was asked to repay it, so this case was filed to request an investigation and recovery of the debt. The defendant absolutely denied having this debt. The case was adjourned for further investigation and verification.

### Resident Certificates in the French Concession Are Being Issued Quickly

Distribution Will Still Be Scheduled to Maintain Order

Resident certificates in various police districts of the French Concession were issued in batches due to the summer heat to avoid crowding. Now that autumn has arrived and the civil police system will be implemented soon, less than half of the residents in the concession have obtained resident certificates. To speed up the issuance, efforts have been made to accelerate efficiency. The residents are still arranged in order by district, by Lianbao (joint guarantee unit), and by Baojia (mutual responsibility system) to collect applications on scheduled days and times. Fingerprints are taken and a handling fee of 50 cents is collected. After collection, a number is assigned, and the date, time, and place for receiving the certificate are specified. At that time, the epidemic prevention certificate can be verified and received.

His five-year-old daughter, Li Yuzhu, was playing with her brother, Li Tianpei, near their home at 8:40 p.m. on the 28th of last month. Unexpectedly, a cart driver, Jiang Xueqian from Jiangbei, was pushing a cart loaded with bricks and weighing more than 1,000 pounds. He accidentally knocked Li Yuzhu down and crushed her left leg while descending the bridge. After Hua Detective Sun Changsheng arrived, he sent the injured person to Shanghai Sanitarium on Bazhi Road for treatment, but she died on the day before yesterday. The police received a report and arrested Jiang Xueqian yesterday and brought him to the police station for detention pending further action.

### Brief News from All Sectors

Change in Congee Distribution Time

The Zhongjiao Daoyi Association on Tongfu Road previously expanded the organization of the congee distribution association due to the spread of the epidemic. Now, in view of the serious social life, the congee distribution is even more active. Every day, thousands of people come to the association to receive congee, and each person is given three large bowls of white congee, requiring more than 3 dan (approximately 300 pounds) of rice per day. The expenses are huge, and it is hoped that all sectors will provide strong support. Due to the cooler weather, the congee distribution time will be changed from 6 a.m. to 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. to 7 p.m. starting today.

### Supplement to Talking About Used Bookstores

In my spare time, I have almost no other hobbies except reading. So, I can be considered a gold digger at used book stalls. I was very happy to read the article "Talking About Used Bookstores" in the Shen Bao on July 23rd, but I felt that there were still many things that had been forgotten, so I would like to add a few points based on what I have seen and heard.

Books to Buy on Fourth Horse Road

Fishermen need to know where there are fish, and gold diggers need to know where there is gold sand, otherwise they will work hard for nothing. This is basic knowledge. Similarly, if you want to sift sand and pick gold from a pile of old books, you must first know what kind of old books are available in what places. Fourth Horse Road is one of the used book markets, as has been said, but as far as I know, from the Zhonghua Book Company to the World Book Company, there is really nothing worth seeing in this area's used bookstores and used book stalls. What is particularly noteworthy is an alley entrance east of the intersection of Henan Road and Fourth Horse Road. There used to be only one used bookstore at this alley entrance, which looked very unimpressive, but now the business is booming. There are actually three owners in a small area separated by bookshelves. One is called Quanj, one is called Heji, and I don't know what the other is called. This place has books in Chinese, English, and German. Most of the German books are medical books, and the Chinese and English books are all reference books and dictionaries. If you are into literature and history, you can often find books to buy here. I bought a collection of devotional poems (Gitahnjalj) by Tagore (R. Tagore) and a collection of essays by the modern British poet Eliot (T.S. Eliot). You can also often find modern series and works by British writers of the 18th and 19th centuries. Two months ago, I saw an English translation of Naeterlinek's "The Treasure of the Humble," which Li Chuli gave to a friend when he was studying in Japan. There was also a long passage on the title page discussing German literature. I didn't buy this book because I already had it, but I don't know who bought it later. According to one of the owners, he also has the second volume of "Hai Shang Shu Lin" (velvet hardcover) for sale for 70 yuan.

A Corner of a Used Book Stall

Rare Novels at the West District Book Stall

If you are done browsing the used bookstores around Avenue Edward VII and Avenue Cardinal Mercier, take a westbound tram. I suggest you get off at the corner of Avenue Edward VII and Hardoon Road. Walk a few steps towards Jing'an Temple and you will see a Jinzhi Bookstore. The owner is a man in his late thirties who looks more refined than other used bookstore owners. It is said that he can also paint a few ink plums, so he must be a scholar who is doing this kind of business due to environmental reasons. This bookstore has a lot of Chinese books, and they are all new literature books. If you like to read new literature books, I guarantee you won't leave empty-handed. The books here are all very clean and have been classified, so it is easy to find the type of book you are looking for. A friend of mine went there once after hearing my introduction and was very satisfied. He told me that there was a reprint of "Na Han" (Call to Arms) with the four characters "Zhou Zuoren Compilation" on it, which was different from the later Beixin edition, making him think deeply. However, I must tell you that the prices here are slightly higher. Sometimes the owner is not there, and the owner's wife may be cheaper.

Turning left from Jinzhi Bookstore onto Avenue Edward VII and running west for a short distance will take you to the Avenue Joffre side, where there are also three used bookstores and two used book stalls. The books here are very mixed and many are very old, but you may occasionally encounter books to buy. I bought a first edition of "Rainy Day" for only two yuan because the owner didn't haggle with me about the edition. If I opened a used bookstore, I would sell this book for ten yuan. More than half a year ago, an owner told me that well-known writers Tang and Qian always come to "Rainy Day" three times a week. If I had the opportunity, he could introduce me to them. Unfortunately, I didn't have the chance to leave a good story. It was truly a missed opportunity.

### Sun Jinshun Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday

### Hongzhang Ping Pong Team Lost to Lester

The Tongren Cup Table Tennis League was held at the Hongzhang Yarn Factory gym on Maigen Road at 6 p.m. yesterday. Lester A team played against Hongzhang. Everyone expected Hongzhang to win easily, but Lester actually won by five to two. The main reason for Hongzhang's failure was complacency. From then on, the future of the championship has been hopeless, which is equivalent to creating a winning opportunity for the Postal Service.

Economic Supplement Issue 431

### Market Trends

Public Debt Continues to Rise

The past week was the second week of the bond market's rebound. In the past two weeks, it has risen by as much as five, six, seven, or eight yuan. There are many factors for this rebound. Tangible factors include the impact of principal and interest payments in Chongqing, Nanjing's acknowledgment of post-war repayment of principal and interest, and the widespread rumors of other optimistic news. Intangible factors include the influx of floating capital and the counter-measures that the monetary authorities should have when the joint reserve system of the silver and money industry becomes the target of adjustment. However, when Tong Jia rose to 45 yuan, the authorities immediately issued a "ceiling price" rumor because the conversion of savings certificates into legal tender had reached 90 yuan. This is obviously a fabrication by the shorts and also shows a lack of common sense. The "ceiling price" system only applies to price controls. If the price of the argument coupon needs to be managed, only the "floor price" can be set. There is absolutely no reason to implement a "ceiling price." Although the above rumors are unsubstantiated, the newly arrived hesitant people are still threatened by the feeling of a 50% discount. In fact, the face value of public debt is denominated in national currency. The essence of the currency is not whether it is new or old, but whether it is national or not.

In short, the future of the bond market does not lie in the currency itself, but in the market itself. If there are no unexpected changes in the market itself, the concept of a 50% discount is not enough to hinder its vigorous advance.

Chinese Stocks are Booming

Chinese stocks rose uniformly last week. The withdrawal of department store stocks in the September 1st price freeze order was also rapid. The rebound of department store stocks one week after the implementation of this order was also rapid. The meaning of this order is to stop price increases on the one hand and allow applications for price increases on the other hand. In other words, free price increases are now prohibited, but once an application is approved, prices can be raised reasonably. Therefore, based on the "asset as the basis for evaluating Chinese stocks" theory, the general rebound of Chinese stocks is logical.

The stocks that fell the most sharply last week were department store stocks. The stocks that rose the most sharply last week were also department store stocks. China National Goods rose by more than 20 yuan. The increases of Wing On and Sincere were similar, but The Sun and The Great World were slightly weaker.

New pharmaceutical stocks are still the "darlings of the times" and continue to rise. For example, Sino-French and Sin Yee each rose by 10%. Sin Asia stood at a high price and still has momentum. Cultural stocks also rose rapidly, while financial stocks were unchanged.

The season is approaching the end of the corporate accounting year. The future of Chinese stocks will be even more solid. However, there are reports that the organization of industry associations has some problems and has been postponed. For this reason, it is certainly a matter of great concern to ask what contribution can be made to curbing speculation and safeguarding the industry if a part of the capital and margin of listed companies is deposited in specific financial institutions. What we can imagine is that if this is the case, the market chips of Chinese stocks will be more concentrated and their entry and exit will be concentrated, so their advantages and disadvantages will be clearly revealed.

Yarn, Cloth, and Woolen Fabric

The trend of yarn and cloth last week had a watershed on Thursday. Before that, the goods were sold off for days, and Feng Ma fell to around 4,800 yuan. After that, they suddenly rebounded and jumped out of the 5,000 yuan level. Ma even reached 5,400 yuan. Long also increased from 160 to 174. This sudden change is said to be related to the agreement on appropriate prices. According to this, the factory cloth of Dong Pi also showed a trend of initial weakness and then support.

In today's yarn and cloth control, wool is an "isolated paradise." The price has been rising steadily for months, and it is the "darling of the times" as winter is approaching. Last week, the trend was even stronger due to the impact of Long Feng's "Soaring Dragon and Phoenix." In terms of its source, appropriate prices are all right.

New Coal System

Starting from the 8th of this month, the amount of coal balls that can be moved within the Concession is limited to four dan (approximately 400 pounds) (formerly limited to one dan), and the highest retail prices are re-announced as follows (retail price per ton):

The above price limit includes delivery. The Shanghai Coal United Association (located in the Sanjing Bank Building), the highest allocation agency for coal balls in this city, also issued a statement that the city has thick inventories and incoming goods are pouring in, so prices can be held steady.

Under the United Association, there are two allocation systems. The allocation system for the Japanese is the Shanghai Coal Merchants Association (20 Sichuan Road) and the Shanghai Hongkou Small Sellers Association (1342 North Sichuan Road). The allocation system for the British and French Concessions is the Dazhonglian Coal Company (33 Sichuan Road), the Shanghai Coal Industry Association (405 Tianjin Road), and the Shanghai Coal Retailers Association (same address). The allocation of coal balls is concentrated in the Shanghai Coal Ball Factory Association at 190 Jiujiang Road.

At the same time, the Lianyi Office, jointly organized by the Shanghai Japanese Charcoal Small Sellers Association and the Chinese Charcoal Small Sellers Association, agreed that the price of charcoal in this city would be 65 fen per kilogram of military currency, including freight.

New Tobacco Prices

The cigarette market was stable for Japanese cigarettes last week, and British and American cigarettes initially rose and then weakened. Yongtaihe also stipulated the retail price limits for each grade of cigarettes at the weekend as follows (unit: military currency fen):

Ten Sticks Ten Sticks

Da Qianmen 37 Pin Hai Brand 22

Xiao San Pao Tai 54 Fairy Brand 19

Da San Pao Tai 68 Wu Hua Brand 19

Red Tin Packet 32 Popper 50

Old Sword Brand 24

The allocation of tobacco in this city is divided into two systems. Japanese cigarettes and Chinese merchant tobacco are distributed by Hongkou, with Japanese cigarettes distributed by the general agency and Chinese merchant tobacco distributed by the general issuing offices of each factory, respectively, through designated wholesalers to appointed retailers for sale.

As for British and American cigarettes, in the Hongkou district, they are distributed through the Sino-U.S. Tobacco Allocation Association to the retailers' association, and then from the association to the retailers. In the Concession area, they are distributed through the Sino-China Tobacco Allocation Association to the appointed wholesalers, and then from each wholesaler to the retailers.

In this allocation process, manufacturers and retailers have no connection, and the Tobacco Exchange Association has regular meetings for buying and selling, which constitutes fluctuations in cigarette prices. Therefore, Dong Bao pays close attention to this organization and believes that it helps to promote speculation. If the authorities pay attention to it again, the future is not without problems.

Another message: Japanese expatriates in Wuxi have implemented a cigarette coupon system, with each person receiving 20 cigarettes per day. Women can also apply.

### Hardware Sales Are Difficult to Boost

Prices Hover in Various Markets

Since yesterday, hardware transactions have remained sluggish. Since the guest helpers have stopped working, the manufacturers in this street are also weak, and the actual sales of various goods are only sporadic. Therefore, it is difficult for the entire hardware market to have a prosperous atmosphere, and the industry's mind is not allowed to be optimistic. The market prices of hardware products are mostly hovering. For example, the price of this factory's round nails is 700 yuan per barrel, the price of 2,000 pounds of black iron billets is 16,000 yuan per bundle, the price of new disc rounds is 16,000 yuan per ton, the price of 100 pounds of single-connected tinplate is 1,100 yuan per box, and the price of 200 pounds of double-connected tinplate is 2,200 yuan per box, which is 100 yuan and 200 yuan lower than before. Double-horse steel and old-fashioned steel are sold for 150 yuan per box. New iron wire 16 to 20 is 14,000 yuan per ton. 21 to 25 is 16,000 yuan per ton. 40-foot bamboo steel bars are 11,000 yuan per ton. 200 pounds of U.S. steel strips are 1,500 yuan each. New foreign round plates are 13,000 yuan per ton. New angle iron is 14,000 yuan per ton. The goods are still lacking in transactions.

### Casual Market Talk

Price management is based on the average price from May 26th to 28th. But how much was the market price at that time? I am afraid that no one can remember.

The September 1st price freeze order is the basis for adjusting prices. Recently, applicants for appropriate prices have sprung up. It can be seen that the so-called adjustment of prices is the adjustment of allowing reasonable price increases. But what is appropriate and what is reasonable? It is difficult to get a handle on it unless each industry has cost accounting. However, the so-called cost accounting is a rare and fashionable thing in China.

In recent years, the five oceans and one industry have been very popular. The so-called five oceans are ocean oil (kerosene), ocean candles (candles), ocean fire (matches), ocean soap (soap), and ocean smoke (cigarettes), a summary of five kinds of daily necessities for farmers. The market penetrates deeply into the people and is closely related to people's livelihood. At a time when the sound of price management is like thunder, Nanjing has established a five oceans exchange, with a daily trading volume of as much as 3 million yuan.

### Moral Decay in Medicine

— Lin Da

The shady dealings of slick doctors in Shanghai are truly diverse and bizarre. “Human hearts are not what they used to be, and morals are declining” – these eight characters perfectly describe the moral decay in the medical world.

Of course, this is not to say that all doctors in Shanghai deserve censure. Only a portion (perhaps only a small portion) disregard medical ethics. However, the unscrupulous and deceptive behavior of this portion is enough to dim the radiant world of medicine.

In Shanghai, there are quite a few well-off patients, and there are also many doctors who are good at making money. Prescriptions costing eighteen thousand, a few days in the hospital costing three to five thousand, and childbirth costing eighteen hundred are not uncommon. This is satisfactory for wealthy patients and money-loving doctors, but it causes hardship for the vast majority of poor people and the middle class. With expensive consultation fees, considerable medicine costs, and even more costly hospitalization, who can afford to get sick?

However, in this distressing society, doctors cannot escape the circle of distress on their own. It is said that in private hospitals, the hospital owners make the money, while the doctors only receive meager salaries. In public hospitals, funding is insufficient, so many doctors leave to open their own clinics.

This is not a problem for renowned doctors with a good reputation. The hardest hit are the young doctors just starting out. Living expenses are high, expenses are large, and patients are few. To maintain their personal and family living expenses, they have to turn their attention to patients, resulting in a decline in medical ethics.

Originally, this issue of medical ethics is fundamentally linked to the medical system and the entire social system. Therefore, the active way to improve medical ethics is not through empty accusations. Fundamentally, it is to socialize medicine, with society responsible for running hospitals and maintaining the lives of doctors, so that doctors become true benefactors of the masses.

### Exterminate Cockroaches!

— Jian Nong

The animal I hate the most in my life is probably the reddish-brown cockroach, which is swift-moving and carries filth. Truly, this nocturnal insect of the order Orthoptera has given me such a terrible impression! When I first arrived in Shanghai and found it under the bed for the first time, its agile body and chaotic crawling made my hair stand on end. From that day on, I inexplicably harbored immense hatred for it. Its filthy appearance and unpleasant smell were the biggest reasons at the time. Whenever I saw it, I always wanted to end its life as quickly as possible. And its swift-footed technique not only didn't impress or admire me, but also increased my anger because it had escaped me so many times.

But now my aversion to cockroaches is not just a temporary idiosyncrasy. It is also a very dangerous enemy that threatens us in many ways, worthy of our slaughter and extermination, worthy of a fight to the death! You say I'm exaggerating a bit? Think carefully. Think about the losses we suffer from it in terms of "material". British scientist Thomson cited Reingard's 1921 publication "Cockroaches" in his "Animal Life History" saying, "They don't spare anything they come across, whether it's edible or not. The paper and paint on the walls, books, boots, shoes, hair, etc., are all delicacies to them." As for stealing, destroying, and contaminating our food and utensils, it is obvious and needs no further explanation. The material losses may be negligible. The "psychological" impact is probably something to consider. Truly, don't you feel strange that you have so many uninvited, villainous robbers in your home? As for me, the mental losses and pain it has caused me are not small. The careful storage of food, the fear of every leftover food, the disgust of thinking about it lurking in every corner of the room, and the resentment of trying to catch it and eliminate it but failing.

However, it has even more serious crimes than the above, indeed enough to be sentenced to death and extermination, namely the spread of various germs, directly threatening our own lives. Reingard already knew that cockroaches are carriers of several pathogens. After a detailed investigation by Japanese doctors in Shanghai in 1935, it was determined that the spread of cholera, typhoid fever, and especially dysentery, are all secretly aided by it. So the spread of cholera in Shanghai this year cannot be said to be without its contribution. Now that the autumn wind is refreshing and the cholera epidemic has subsided slightly, dysentery germs are probably waiting for an opportunity to move! Since cockroaches are accomplices of dysentery germs, for the sake of saving ourselves and others, how can we sit idly by and watch them rampage without decisively exterminating them?

I heard that our countrymen have invented traps for catching cockroaches, but the price is too expensive to be widely used. Using various chemical drugs such as sodium fluoride and arsenic is not safe for people themselves. I also heard that someone invented two kinds of non-toxic powder that are very effective in killing cockroaches. I don't know if it's true and whether the price is affordable for the masses. In any case, the simplest and most effective method that doesn't require spending money is to use our own hands. Finally, I hope everyone will rise up together to eliminate this annoying and harmful smelly thing!

### Motherly Love

— Ou Li

When children are young, mothers should insist that they learn to be responsible. This is true motherly love. If parents were willing not to wipe their children's noses, we wouldn't have so many divorce cases today. But this is not surprising because wiping a child's nose is much easier than teaching them to wipe it themselves.

### Sharing the Same Boat in Storms

— He Jia Zhi

(Nine) Hell on Earth

Wei Yunqing slammed the table again and said, "Please call the young master!" A-Si knew that calling the young master was his job and hurriedly responded with a "yes" and retreated. But in just a blink of an eye, he walked back in, his hands hanging down, and replied, "Sir, the young master is out, not at home." Wei Yunqing's eyes were about to burst open, and he shouted, "You bastard! You just went outside, turned around, and walked back in. Where did you go to look for the young master? You have no respect for your master, you bastard! Bastard!" A-Si said, "I wouldn't dare be a bastard or lie to you, sir. Madam is outside, and she said the young master went out." Wei Yunqing said, "Please call the young madam!" The words spoken in the room were of course heard clearly outside. Before A-Si could call her, Wei Sheng Yun's wife, Yuan Shi, walked in tremblingly. She was originally a child bride raised in Wei Yunqing's family. She married Wei Shao Yun at the age of eighteen because no one in her family dared to express any dissatisfaction with Wei Yunqing's words on behalf of Yuan Shi. Therefore, Yuan Shi's position in the Wei family was lower than that of an old long-term worker. She came in and moved her lips, but no one could hear that she was calling her father-in-law. Wei Yunqing asked with an angry face, "Where is Shao Yun?" Yuan Shi looked at the ground and replied, "He went out." Wei Yunqing said, "Where did he go?" Yuan Shi said, "I don't know." Wei Yunqing said, "I respect you and call you young madam. How come you can't control your husband after all these years? I think you can be fired from this young madam position." Ji Ta Shi didn't say anything and dropped two tears on the ground.

Wei Yunqing simply started talking in a sweeping manner, saying, "I give you four people a deadline to find Miss Bian back in one town. If you can't find Miss Bian, then find the young master back. I, Wei Yunqing, have a belly full of fire. You better be careful." A-Si, Cao Ma, Qi Shi, and Yuan Shi all raised their heads and looked at each other, unable to say a word. (180)

### Idle Talk About Pawnbroking

— Xiao Zhao Feng

(Five) May I ask, how much is the salary?

[Missing Section] There are names like writing tickets, wrapping packages, clearing tickets, and hanging signs. The whole day's work of writing tickets is like sitting on a cold bench. Wrapping packages involves wrapping up the pawned clothes every day, which takes about three hours. The work of the pawnshop apprentice looks like rough work, but it is actually the best time to learn. First, look at the clothes and estimate a pawn price. Then, look at the pawn price written on the small ticket by the shopkeeper and see if it is close to your own estimate. If you think the quality price is too different, you can ask the package manager to evaluate it. If it is as you thought, then record the number, item name, and pawn price in the "unworthy" book. In the future, if it is sold at a loss and does not cover the principal, the person who handled it will have to compensate for the loss. Clearing tickets is the most important job, only copying the redemption tickets of the day in the book and calculating the principal and interest, which is checked by the package manager. Hanging signs is a very easy job, hanging the written number tags one by one on the straw ropes of the wrapped packages. But this position, like the decoration manager, does not need to be specially set up, and the package wrappers sing it themselves. Below this are "students", called university second graders, etc., about one to three people, without special duties, assisting in the missing work and holding the lowest-level jobs. Small boys serve the fox, cat, and lady, making rice, sweeping repeatedly, and looking for packages. Otherwise, they are called east and west by the teachers to do chores. This is the most difficult apprenticeship period, and it is also the beginning of becoming a great teacher.

If you ask a pawnbroker how much his salary is, he will first answer you in a very low voice. This standard of living can only support a cat at most, and it will not starve to death. If you don't believe it, he will tell you the reason why it is so low. At the same time, you will know that the main income of pawnbrokers is not salary, but storage fees. Assuming that a medium-sized pawnshop with a capital of 100,000 yuan per month should be considered to have good profits, you can imagine that the storage fee for 100,000 yuan in capital is 5,000 yuan. Divided among these ten or so people, it is not a small amount. They are divided into shares, with about 40% or more for the internal positions, 30% for the external positions, and the rest for the middle positions and students. The lowest positions have no other commissions. The so-called pawn reading fee is distributed by the superiors. A certain profit is also extracted from the sale of packages and distributed to the whole body. If the situation is good at the end of the year, you can also taste the taste of bonuses.

Pawnshops offer poorer treatment. Most of them have no other regulations besides storage fees. Even more than half of the storage fees are taken by the boss class. Because the storage fees are larger than pawnbroking and the number of people is half of pawnbroking, isn't the income for those working too cheap? Therefore, smart bosses, even if they don't work, have to establish seven items and deduct a certain percentage of them.

The income of pawnshop employees varies depending on the amount of business of the pawnshop. The number is roughly from 200 to thousands of white yuan per month for those in internal and external positions, and from 30 to 600 yuan for those below the middle positions. And pawnshop employees all consider becoming a shopkeeper as the most rewarding. The job is both profitable and has status. And people with good skills will be invited to high positions.

Pawnbroker employees are mostly worry-free in terms of living expenses because they don't overspend and can accumulate some savings. Many internal personnel who are older have well-off families and are even pawnshop owners. Their work is light and leisurely. In addition to calculating their own family property, their work in the pawnshop is to monitor all the actions of their subordinates, because pawnshops have a large number of goods deposited in them. If someone with insufficient self-control has a move on these goods, it will be terrible for them. They have a considerable responsibility, so they measure everyone with thief-like eyes without being bothered. At the same time, as long as you behave properly and gain their trust, your job is very secure, and it is by no means comparable to the casual suspension of business in other occupations.

In short, pawnbroking is earning the blood of the poor, and now it is injecting this earned blood back into the bodies of the poor. Speaking of the cycle of heaven, this is a very good ironclad proof. However, the beginning of opening a pawnshop is to make money, not to intentionally give alms to the poor. This time, unknowingly, they are naturally helpless. So where is pawnbroking going? I say that before prices are absolutely stable, they are holding a wait-and-see attitude, neither trying to do business as much as possible nor closing down immediately. They will wait and see for a few more months before they can decide their fate. And this large group of pawnshop employees will follow this fate. Nearly ten thousand people are sighing and wondering where to go. (End of the whole chapter)
