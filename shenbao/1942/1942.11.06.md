### North African German-Italian Allied Forces Adopt Flexible Strategy, Moving to Better Positions to Continue Striking Attacking British Forces

A Reuters dispatch from the capital of Switzerland, dated the 5th: The British Eighth Army launched its fiercest attack yesterday on all positions of General Rommel on the Egyptian front, causing the Axis lines to retreat. According to a report from Cairo, the Axis forces are withdrawing along the coastal slopes to better positions. At the same time, the German Air Force is providing cover for the attacking British Air Force. The details of the battle are not yet known. More detailed news may be available within twelve hours. However, it is reported that the Axis forces have now retreated to one mile west of El Alamein. General Montgomery's attack on the 12th began yesterday morning. The British army concentrated all its forces on the northern flank of Alamein and began its offensive. At the same time, intensive artillery fire had already begun at midnight, bombarding for six hours. According to Berlin sources, the first British attack, without tanks, was repelled with heavy losses. The second attack involved tanks. Berlin also acknowledged the loss of some positions, but called this General Rommel's flexible strategy. With the northern battle being fierce, attacks also began in the south and center of Alamein, led by intense artillery fire and bombing. Cairo claims that the British have advanced past Himemat, but the British are advancing cautiously because General Rommel's armored units have not yet been mobilized, and their direct-fire artillery has also inflicted heavy losses on the British.

A Havas dispatch from Rome, dated the 5th: The General Headquarters announced that yesterday, mixed units of our tanks and infantry engaged in a day-long bloody battle with similar enemy units in the desert area between Alamein and Fuka. After unprecedentedly fierce resistance, the German-Italian Allied forces retreated towards a new line of defense to the west in the evening. The enemy suffered heavy losses in tanks and soldiers, and our side also suffered heavy losses. Axis fighter planes engaged in air battles with enemy planes, shooting down twenty-six enemy planes in the past two days. Italian planes also strafed enemy tank columns with machine guns at low altitude. Enemy planes bombed Tobruk and Benghazi, causing heavy ground damage.

A DNB rapid dispatch from Berlin, dated the 5th: According to responsible military officials here, the British forces in North Africa lost 52 heavy tanks and 25 aircraft yesterday. Only two German planes were lost. Intense fighting took place over Alamein yesterday, with the British suffering heavy losses. After repelling enemy aircraft, German planes attacked British tank columns.

A Havas dispatch from Berlin, dated the 4th: Military figures here recently stated that the commander of the British Eighth Army, General Montgomery, again launched an all-out offensive this morning in the northern sector of the El Alamein area, first subjecting the Axis positions to heavy artillery bombardment for six hours, and then advancing troops from South Africa, New Zealand, Australia, and India. The first attack was repelled because it lacked tank cover, resulting in heavy losses. The second attack, under the cover of tanks, made some progress in certain areas. However, the Axis forces adopted a flexible defense, keeping their armored units in the rear and only using artillery and anti-aircraft guns to bombard the enemy, which proved quite effective. Concentrated artillery fire destroyed eleven British heavy tanks in one hour. German-Italian grenade units were also very effective in attacking British tanks. This morning, the German-Italian Allied forces adopted a new defensive strategy to continue inflicting heavy damage on the enemy. The British forces failed to achieve significant gains and instead lost many tanks and various heavy weapons. However, the war in that area is still ongoing.

### Africa in the Changing Winds: Egypt—The Second Gateway to the Center of the War (4)

Since Sudan and the southeastern half of Africa are both under British control, and West Africa is scattered with several territories, separated only by a strip of free French territory, the Belgian Congo, and Portuguese Angola, to secure maritime supplies along the west, southwest, and southeast coasts of Africa, one only needs to build a highway across the free French territory to connect everything, reaching Egypt and Sudan, and then transferring to Egypt. Therefore, the Sudanese highway is a crucial key to the gateway of Egypt, especially after the proliferation of Italian mosquito boats in the Mediterranean Sea.

As for the second key to the gateway of Egypt, the Suez Canal, its fame has long been established, known to all, and its importance need not be elaborated upon. It is better to leave some space to write about Alexandria, the third key.

Alexandria (sometimes translated as Alexandria, also known as the Port of Alexandria). This name is very familiar. Recent news reports about North Africa often mention General Alexander, which has nothing to do with the place name of Alexandria mentioned in this article. However, the Macedonian King Alexander the Great, who was invincible more than three hundred years before Christ, has a direct connection with this place name.

Originally, the history of Egypt, up to the present, is at least five thousand five hundred years. However, after more than two thousand years of its founding, it began to decline around 1500 BC. Until now, that shattered land has never been completely restored. In 332 BC, Alexander the Great arrived in Egypt. He wanted to find a suitable location in Egypt to build a center of Greek power, while connecting Macedonia and the Nile River basin, and also building a solid naval port. After searching back and forth, he built a military station on the island of Pharos along the coast of what is now the city of Alexandria. Later, Alexander's general Ptolemy went to Egypt and established himself as king, and then built Alexandria into a city, considering it his capital.

The Ptolemaic kings also extended their rule here for more than two hundred years, after which it was seized by the Roman Emperor Augustus. This small city has witnessed many rises and falls in its more than two thousand years of history. After Rome, it was once occupied by the Persians in 616 AD. In 640 AD, it was looted and occupied by the Arabs; later, there were Turkish invasions, and then the regaining of control by returning forces, until 1517 when it was recovered by Turkey. Then came Napoleon's landing around 1800. The following year, the British assembled a large navy and engaged in a major battle with the French forces. Although Alexandria ceased to be the capital of Egypt in 1863.

Although Alexandria has experienced such rises and falls, it has not diminished its prosperity for more than two thousand years, because it is not only a military port but also a metropolis, and at the same time a famous commercial port in the Mediterranean. Because of its prosperity, it has also produced many romantic incidents; the most glamorous and popular of which is the scandalous relationship between the Egyptian Queen Cleopatra and the Roman General Caesar.

As for historical sites, there is the most famous Temple of Alexandria, a relic from 50 BC. The current Arab cemetery still preserves the columns of Pompey from more than two thousand years ago. At the eastern end of the island of Pharos stands a lighthouse more than four hundred feet high, one of the seven wonders of the world. In addition, there are two white stone spires on the seaside, called "Cleopatra's Needles," a souvenir left by the romantic queen for posterity to remember.

This city is not very large. According to a survey in 1930, the population was only about 560,000. Among them, besides the local natives, about one-fifth are expatriates from various European and Asian countries. Since the construction of Cairo in 969 AD, and the opening of the Cape of Good Hope route in 1498, Alexandria's commerce has declined considerably. However, since the construction of the railway directly to Cairo in 1856, it has gradually restored its former prosperity. Eighty percent of Britain's imports and exports are traded here.

But the reason why Alexandria is so important lies in its military port. The military port here is built based on the natural terrain, divided into inner and outer ports: the outer port covers about 8,900 acres, and the inner port occupies an area of more than 3,000 acres. The old port was built in 1871, and in 1906, two years of engineering were spent to expand it by more than two miles.

The terrain here has many shallow beaches dozens of miles offshore, while the land along the coast has many cliffs, making it difficult to land from the sea here.

However, the German-Italian allied forces are attacking along the coast of Libya, and the Alamein front line is only a hundred miles away from Alexandria. In theory, the situation in the city should be quite tense. Although the British army has launched an offensive for more than a week, it is said that this is only a probing attack; therefore, both sides are still preparing for war, waiting for a bloody battle. Under this tense situation, people all over the world who care about the current situation are focusing on this key, to see if it can firmly block the second gateway to the center of the war—Egypt.

### The Situation in West Africa is Urgent: French Side Actively Evacuating Residents; Laval Convenes Meetings

### The British are Concentrating a Large Number of Warships in Gibraltar; Forty Giant Aircraft Have Also Arrived, but Most Have Flown to the Mediterranean Sea

Vichy, 5th (Haitong News Agency) - According to reports from La Línea, the British are concentrating a considerable number of warships in Gibraltar. In addition to the 22,450-ton aircraft carrier "Furious", the 14,450-ton aircraft carrier "Giant" and a large number of destroyers, auxiliary cruisers, and four submarines, several other warships have arrived at the port.

### Key Republican Figure Dewey Elected Governor of New York; Democrats Still Dominate Both Houses; Roosevelt's Policies Unaffected

New York, 4th (Havas News Agency) - Elections for members of the US Senate and House of Representatives and gubernatorial elections were held yesterday. The preliminary results obtained by the Republican Party are still difficult to estimate at this time. However, political figures here attach great importance to the election of New York State Attorney General Dewey as Governor of New York. They all say that judging from the election of Republican candidates in New York State, it can be known that many Americans do not fully agree with the policies adopted by the government authorities in the war, or may agree to adopt an isolationist attitude after the end of the current war. As far as Dewey himself is concerned, although he has repeatedly declared, "In this war, it is necessary to strive for victory at any cost," he has repeatedly criticized the organization of war industries and demanded that the authorities take effective measures to handle public affairs properly. He also opposes the government's proposed post-war reconstruction plan, because he has always opposed the United States cooperating with other countries in the world to jointly organize a new world after the end of the war. Dewey has always advocated absolute nationalism, so his opponents even claim that Dewey will adopt the path of absolute isolationism, "so that the mistakes of 1919 will be repeated in the future." In addition, after Dewey is elected Governor of New York, he may be a presidential candidate in 1944, so the position of Willkie, who has always been the Republican presidential candidate, will be greatly weakened.

Lisbon, 5th (Haitong News Agency) - According to news from Washington, the Republican Party has a considerable advantage in the election of members of the US Congress. In the House of Representatives with 435 seats, the Democratic Party originally had 267 seats, the Republican Party had 162 seats, and the Independent Party had 6 seats. Currently, the Democratic Party has won 187 seats, the Republican Party has won 162 seats, and the remaining 86 seats have not yet been announced. Among the 32 new senators, the Republican Party has won 9 seats and the Democratic Party has won 15 seats. Among the 33 new governors, Republicans occupy 15 seats and Democrats occupy 18 seats. It is expected that the Democratic Party will still maintain its advantage in the House of Representatives. Two-thirds of the senators have not been re-elected, and the Democratic Party will continue to maintain its advantage in the Senate.

Lisbon, 5th (Haitong News Agency) - Washington telegram, the provisional results of the US gubernatorial election show that Republicans have been elected in 18 states, and Democrats have been elected in 15 states. In four states, which were previously governed by Democrats, Republicans have now taken over.

Berlin, 5th (Haitong News Agency) - Berlin political figures said that even if the Republican Party wins a major victory in the US gubernatorial election, it will not be enough to change Roosevelt's policies. Roosevelt's mistakes can no longer be corrected by constitutional methods.

### Authorities Adopt Strict Measures; Black Market Rice Prices Drop; Illegal Traders to be Punished

The English-language *Shanghai Times* reports that, due to effective steps taken by the authorities, rice prices, which had soared to unprecedented levels in the past two weeks, fell back to normal yesterday. The authorities are determined to eliminate all hoarding and profiteering, and will take strict measures to punish all those engaged in illegal trading of essential goods. The French police also arrested rice vendors on Tuesday who were found to be transporting more than two *dou* of rice around the city, in violation of the rules. These rice vendors have been commonly seen on the streets of the city in recent days, selling rice outside of the allotted areas to earn high profits.

### Clean-up of Pickpocketing Campaign Achieves Good Results

"At least For the Next Two Months, Residents can Avoid Being Pickpocketed"

The English-language *Shanghai Times* reports that a senior official of the Police Department told reporters yesterday that the clean-up of pickpocketing campaign has been successful and ended on the 1st of this month, adding that Shanghai will be free of pickpocketing for at least the next two months.

"More than 200 Pickpockets Arrested"

According to the official, there are currently 900 pickpockets in Shanghai, about two-thirds of whom are often detained. During the campaign, more than 300 pickpockets were arrested, most of whom have been charged and sentenced. About 120 people are released from prison each month, and a similar number are punished. This indicates the constant cycle of pickpocketing. It is said that no more pickpockets will be released in the next two months, allowing a break before the next round of arrests is carried out.

"Pickpockets Sentenced to Up to Nine Months"

During the campaign to clean up pickpocketing, every suspect in public vehicles, theaters, entertainment venues, department stores, and other public places was questioned. The police have gained experience in identifying pickpockets in the past six months. First-time offenders are usually sentenced to one to three months, repeat offenders are sentenced to three to four months, third-time offenders are sentenced to four to six months, and habitual offenders (three or more times) are sentenced to six to nine months. This campaign, which began on October 7, has been fruitful every day as a result of the strict measures taken by the police, so the Police Department is quite optimistic. According to the official, the first batch of pickpockets imprisoned in Shanghai will not be released for at least two months. He said that the most important step in preventing pickpocketing has been implemented, and now the arrest of all pickpockets and thieves will continue.

### Holding Crabs and Appreciating Chrysanthemums

(Continued) Chrysanthemums are reclusive gentlemen, and appreciating them requires a leisurely and tranquil state of mind. Tao Yuanming wrote in his poem, "Picking chrysanthemums under the eastern fence, I leisurely see the Southern Mountains." The word "leisurely" is truly a stroke of genius, and no other word can express it. Last week, I received four precious chrysanthemums from the owner of Huangyuan Garden. One is called "Golden Net Case," with one side of the flower yellow and the other red. The second is called "Pear Fragrance." Chrysanthemums have color but no fragrance, so this is grafted. The method is to insert the chrysanthemum seedling into the pear branch, and the flower then has the elegant, sweet taste of pear fragrance. The third is called "Ink Cloud," with purple or dark red colors, which are the most precious and unusual among chrysanthemums. This one is deep purple, almost black, making it especially valuable. The fourth is called "Ten-Foot Pearl Curtain," with petals that are thin and slender like hair, falling down in a profusion, with a delicate, fragile air. Li Qingzhao wrote in her poem, "The wind rolls up the curtain, and the person is thinner than the yellow flower." She probably had not seen this kind of rare species, otherwise, she would not have dared to make this comparison so lightly.

My residence is cramped, and I have no eastern fence, not even a courtyard. These four pots of chrysanthemums are placed on my desk as a simple offering. After facing them for a long time, I find that chrysanthemums are best appreciated under lamplight. The light does not need to be strong, but it should be able to cast the shadow of the chrysanthemums on the wall. With a cigarette in my mouth, I sit silently, watching the chrysanthemum shadows on the wall, which are reminiscent of the paintings of Bada Shanren. I turn back to admire the flowers again, and occasionally blow a puff of thick smoke towards the petals, creating the beauty of smoke enveloping peonies.

"People have the same tastes for flavors!" Crab meat is delicious, and everyone loves to eat it, but the degree of love varies greatly. Generally, those who love it excessively or eat a large amount can be said to have a "癖" (addiction/idiosyncratic hobby). For example, Tan Yankai was addicted to shark fin soup, and could not eat without it. Ma Xiangbo liked to eat stinky tofu, and would feel ill if he did not have it for a day. The most famous crab lover in modern times was Li Meian (Qing Daoren), who was known as "Li Hundred Crabs." He sold his calligraphy in Shanghai during the early Republic of China, and most of his income went to pay for crabs. He had shares in the Xiaoyoutian Min cuisine restaurant on Sanma Road, and after three years of accounting, his dividends and capital were all turned into crab roe powder and shark fin soup. It is said that he had to eat a hundred crabs each time to satisfy his craving. As for the ancients, there were also many examples. Bi Libu said, "With a wine cup in my right hand and a crab claw in my left hand, floating in a wine boat, I can end my life like this!" Huang Junzai wrote in his "Golden Pot Playful Ink," "The taste of crab is loved by everyone, but Lu Shao Kui of Jinhua loves it even more. He eats and praises it, and others ridicule him. Shao Kui said, 'My love for crabs is still not enough, not as much as my teacher. After my teacher eats, he does not wash his hands, but puts them in his sleeves, saying, 'I will keep this remaining fragrance to play with in the quilt.'"" Zhu Qigong of the Qing Dynasty was also addicted to crabs. One day, he was eating crabs and drinking alone when someone came to report that he had been offered the position of "八座" (high-ranking official). Zhu scolded, "Go away! I would not trade eight feet for 八座 (high office)," and continued to eat heartily.

Fifteen years ago, the New World Amusement Park suddenly found a rare treasure, called the "Beauty Crab," which was obtained from the Ningbo coast. The advertisements were exaggerated, saying that not only were its eyebrows and eyes like paintings, but it could also make seductive winks. This gimmick was much more clever than the two-headed turtle in a certain theater not long ago. Tens of thousands of people rushed to see it, exclaiming in wonder. The ticket revenue was more than 100,000. At that time, I was still a student, and I skipped class to go and see it for myself. This crab was kept in a water basin, and was as big as a silver dollar. The patterns on its back vaguely resembled the facial features of a human face. Whether it was a beauty was difficult to judge. However, it could indeed make seductive winks: it turned out that the so-called crab beauty's flirtatious gaze was precisely the transparent part of the crab shell. When the crab crawled in the water, its internal organs also moved slightly. Viewed vaguely, it could be said to be making seductive winks, or it could be said to be shedding tears in the wind! Later, I don't know if someone was slandering it, or if a secret was leaked, saying that it was fake, and was painted with a kind of chemical potion that would not fade in water, and that was all.

At the same time, I also saw a "Zhang Fei Crab" at the Yu Garden exhibition, which was genuine. It was produced on the coast of Fujian, and would die as soon as it left the water, so it had already been made into a specimen. It was black in color, as big as an alarm clock, and the patterns on its back were cracked and disheveled, just like Yuan Shihai in "Luhua Dang".

Writing to this point, I remember that Qu Yuan's "Chu Ci" has a line "eating the fallen petals of autumn chrysanthemums." Writers often make jokes because of insufficient experience, and this has been the case since ancient times! According to the characteristics of chrysanthemums, in addition to blooming after frost, they do not wither even when they are withered. Other flowers fall in a dazzling display after they have bloomed, but chrysanthemums are not like that. We cannot interfere with Qu Yuan's eating chrysanthemum hot pot, but the word "fallen" is really inappropriate. Song Yanfangxiu Zhu 颎zhen wrote in his poem: "菊可抱向枝上死，不隨黃葉舞秋風。(Chrysanthemums can be embraced and die on the branches, not dancing with the yellow leaves in the autumn wind.)" It can be seen that even ancient chrysanthemums may not have had the phenomenon of fallen petals!

This article has been written and placed on my desk for a long time. Today, a friend came to visit and casually flipped through it. His expression was serious, and he wrote four lines:

"Holding stinging crabs and appreciating chrysanthemums? It is exactly the right time; in times of war and chaos, there is no such leisure. A reporter finds this uninteresting, and cannot help but feel very frustrated, and wants to stuff it into the wastebasket. Then he remembers that at this time and place, there are still many people with leisurely moods, and besides, one's own article is good, and it would be a pity to discard it, so he pays it to be published, hoping that the readers will not criticize it for being boring, and has great expectations!" (The End)

### Public Debt Market: Much Struggling

In yesterday's gray market for public bonds, both buyers and sellers were quite competitive. Buyers wanted to raise prices but lacked the courage, and sellers wanted to lower prices but were not strong enough. Therefore, market prices struggled quite a bit, and market sentiment remained uneasy. Those who entered the market believed that the air was still just air, while those who exited believed that it was inevitable. In general, regulation is inevitable. Everything is already under regulation, so how can public debt be an exception? It is only known how much the degree of regulation will be. At present, buying and selling are still groping in the dark. Yesterday, Class C bonds initially traded at five yuan, then dropped to as low as four yuan, and then rose to as high as five yuan and nine jiao, but ultimately remained at five yuan. The chaotic market conditions are enough to show the anxiety of people's hearts. Before a formal announcement is made, there will still be much volatility in the future.

According to a letter from a customer, the price of Tongan's top-quality Gulangyu is up by one-third before and after processing. Compared with the initial market, it must exceed five-tenths, it is said.

Indian Frankincense Gradually Rises: Indian frankincense has been out of stock for a long time, and the market inventory is not thick. Due to the possibility of a source interruption, the price is gradually tightening. Initially, it rose by 50 yards, and then rose by 150 yards, with a sharp increase of one-third before and after. The current market price is 6,000 yuan plus commission, and the trend is firm.

Black Iron Billets Sale Sluggish: Transactions in 2,000-pound black iron billets have not been smooth recently. Only a few loads were opened by the door yesterday. The market is stable to firm. Yesterday, each ton was still sold for around 15,000 yuan. Sales of other products were also mostly sluggish due to high prices. For example, each box of 100-pound American Company iron was 1,700 yuan, each box of 200-pound strip iron was 1,400 yuan, new lead wire was quoted at 22,000 yuan, white lead wire was 15,000 yuan, and new angle iron was 16,000 yuan (patterns were added at discretion).

### Yellow Chrysanthemums Bloom, Purple Crabs Are Fat

— Gong (a pen name)

The autumn sky is clear, yellow chrysanthemums are blooming, and purple crabs are fat. Holding crabs and appreciating chrysanthemums is exactly the right thing to do. But in this end of times, many people have long lost this leisure. What is possible is to look at the crab market on the street and look at the chrysanthemums in the park. When my eyes come into contact with the fat crabs in the cage and the blooming chrysanthemums, I often have some feelings.

Most people do not have good feelings towards crabs. Some say that they are "腸公子" (intestine-less gentlemen), and some say that they are "橫行介士" (sideways-walking armored warriors). So, using this as an excuse, they capture them, bind them, imprison them, and finally kill and eat them, saying, "It is right to do so." In fact, a crab's lack of intestines is physiological, and its sideways walking is instinctual. Crabs cannot control themselves. Moreover, in the animal kingdom, they are not so intestine-less as to kill each other like spiders, nor so sideways-walking as to infringe on humans like bedbugs. In this world, there are those who are granted but specially imitate arrogance without being granted, and those who are born to walk straight but falsely learn to walk sideways like crabs. Are they not worse than crabs? Therefore, it is fine if people eat crab meat because they are gluttonous, but why should they be so critical of crabs?

Chrysanthemums, blooming in defiance of frost, have always been called lofty hermits among flowers. But in this modern era, loftiness is fine, but it is not acceptable to escape reality and be a hermit who lives life without working. Chrysanthemums are already outdated. Moreover, chrysanthemums are for people to appreciate for their color and fragrance. The fat-headed, big-bellied merchants can appreciate them, the coolies who cannot distinguish beans from wheat can appreciate them, and even those who have no heart and no brain can appreciate them. Chrysanthemums are born in this strange and chaotic world, and they specialize in pleasing people, which is unfortunate and pitiful enough.

### Twenty-Fifth Year

— Hai Lin

The secluded starlight lingered in the still night sky. On the silent Jing'an Temple Road, a few lonely streetlights reflected a serene and solemn atmosphere on the asphalt. Gusts of melancholic and languid autumn wind carried a vast coldness.

At the entrance of a fur shop at the Gordon Road intersection, on a wicker chair that was out all year round, a Russian old man, completely shrunken and hidden in a leather coat, only revealing a head with a fluttering silver beard, wearing a round-brimmed, flat-topped Cossack hat, vaguely looked up at the large clock hanging outside Hendry’s next door. It was already half past two. He then looked at the deep blue sky. Bored, he lit a cigarette, emptily watching the drifting smoke, symbolizing his lonely and sorrowful old age, disappearing into his silver beard.

The cold wind blew his refined and gentle old face into the warm leather collar. The remaining cigarette butt slipped from his hand to the ground. Curling smoke surrounded him, making him fantasize in reverie. He coughed a few times, and the strings of his trembling heart played his clear and heroic march, as if he were riding a steed. A Cossack knight, a favored subject of the Russian Emperor Nicholas II, what an enviable hero!

He remembered clearly, one day he escaped the encirclement of rouge in a hotel, strolling on the streets in the deep night just like today. He took a breath of the cool air before dawn, feeling very comfortable all over. His feet in leather boots carried his robust body to the slums of the Russian Imperial city! Suddenly, he heard a murmuring song, naturally rich in composure and distance with singing instinct. He followed the singing closer, and saw a lonely old man, with dirty and greasy clothes, beard connected to his hair, a typical Russian old man, singing while putting bundles of straw onto a carriage, skillfully and mechanically. He couldn't help but go up and ask him, "Hey, old man, are you alone?"

"Yes, just alone, but now there are two of us, young knight." A polite, but reluctant answer.

"Working so late, you're too diligent, and too pitiful, a lonely old man living in the world."

"No! I don't like others pitying me, you should praise me. I'm not too old. I work with my hands and provide my own black bread. I'm still very proud. At fifty-nine, I can still support myself."

"Then please forgive me, but I still don't understand. Are you really a pitiful person, so old, and without younger generations to support you, to let you rest. I'm so young, and I still have so many people serving me, working for me, that's when I'm happy. If I had to work myself, that would be too hard. So, may I ask, old man, do you feel bitter living like this?"

"Bitter! You are too young, you don't understand what 'bitterness' is, what 'joy' is. But I can tell you, I am very happy. You will slowly understand. Goodbye! Noble young man, I still have to rush to the market!" The old man's old, dark cheeks revealed a mysterious smile, and he sat on the carriage, swaying as the sluggish wheels rolled away.

Gazing at the departing dust, he walked back to the magnificent palace in contemplation! This happened in 1916, and this question never left him. The revolution broke out in 1917, and he wandered everywhere like a stray dog. Along the way, he supported himself with his own hands. At first, he was very depressed and felt desolate, but he gradually got used to it. He believed in the ability of his own hands.

Now, twenty-five years later, in 1942 Shanghai, he is old. His silver-white beard, like vigorously growing weeds, grows on his face. His hair is white, his body is shrunken. Even though he grew up on the Siberian ice plains, now, even on autumn nights, he has to put on a leather coat.

Working as a clerk in a fur shop has become a profession for White Russians. Composure, perseverance, serenity, and alertness are their characteristics.

He never dreamed that the aristocrat of twenty-five years ago would now be a clerk, but he also never dreamed that he would become the lonely old man he had a brief conversation with twenty-five years ago.

The embers of the cigarette went out, and he seemed to have become aware of everything. He looked at the clock, it was already five o'clock. He was used to it and knew that it would be dawn soon. A gust of cold wind blew, and the sober him was reflecting on the truth of the old man's words twenty-five years ago.

He felt a little hungry. He casually took out a piece of black bread from under the wicker chair and gnawed on it. He suddenly understood. He thought, "I am also fifty years old, but I can earn this black bread with my own ability and support myself. This is indeed something to be proud of. Otherwise, if the revolution hadn't happened, I would definitely be lying on a luxurious bed now, being force-fed milk by attendants or younger generations, waiting for death like a living corpse. What's the point of living like that? A 'person' is born into the world to struggle! I am still young after all? I still have brilliant vitality!" I am not afraid of bread prices rising. I can still withstand the wind and frost and resist this cold long night. My arms still have muscles, my blood is still boiling... I am too excited, I am still young!" He jumped up, humming the marching song of the Cossack cavalry. He had found the joy of "life"!

Dawn broke, and the sun warmly shone on the earth, passionately gazing at the silver-white beard and young heart of this Russian aristocratic old man.

### ### Youths Running Out of School

— Zhu Zunian

In this current society where life is difficult, it is already not easy to have enough food and clothing every day. If one still has the strength to go to high school or university to study, I think no one can deny that he is a "darling of heaven," a lucky person. You see, how many young people want to enter the highest institutions of learning, but are forced by money to drop out and get a job halfway through, and can only enviously watch others continue their unfinished studies.

That being said, isn't being able to run into the doors of high school and university what every one of our young people most hopes for?

It is a strange thing that happens unexpectedly. Many people don't have money and can't get in. But there is a group of young masters who have the ability to go to school and study diligently, they don't need to worry about life, but they are unwilling to go, and even willing to throw away the hundreds of dollars of fees they have already paid for this semester, dropping out of school halfway.

Then, what are they doing it for? What are they doing outside of school?

The answer is that they want to plunge into the commercial arena in order to make a big fortune.

In this era, everything is soaring in price. Anyone who has some money in their hands and does business themselves is making a hundredfold profit. The number of nouveaux riches is simply astonishing. Some of them are illiterate, and some of them used to be small clerks or apprentices in old-fashioned stores. Now, most of them have millions around their waists and are wealthy men with large bellies. They travel in carriages and horses, eat in expensive restaurants, and wear silk and wool goods.

It is said that life in the world is always about fame and fortune. Especially those who talk about "realism," they shout that money is supreme and enjoyment comes first. In this situation, how can students not be tempted and moved? They believe that the reason they want to study is to become high-ranking officials and make a lot of money in the future. Now that there is an opportunity to make a lot of money without a diploma or knowledge, then why bother reading and studying? So they want to run out of school.

I still remember when I was studying in elementary school, I often heard the teachers say that the Father of the Nation, Sun Yat-sen, said: We should aspire to do great things, not aspire to become high-ranking officials. The meaning is to ask us to aspire to do undertakings that are beneficial to society and the country, not to become officials who prey on the people.

Looking at the students mentioned earlier, they not only do not aspire to do great things that are beneficial to society and the country, but instead want to become manipulators and big bosses who harm the people in the same way as officials who prey on the people.

This is a problem. A serious ideological problem for students.

### ### Poor Teacher Giving Gifts

— Zhi

Receiving a red invitation card from the school clerk, I knew it was another wedding invitation from a student. Sure enough, what caught my eye were the words "My son/daughter so-and-so is holding a wedding ceremony, respectfully inviting your presence." I remembered that so-and-so was a student from such-and-such year. I am grateful that he didn't forget me and still remembered that there was a poor teacher like me, but I felt a bit flattered!

In these times of high prices, the gifts must of course also be increased. It's impossible to give less than ten or twenty yuan, which is a bit difficult. The salary we get from teaching is not even enough to maintain our lives, leaving us with empty pockets. Having to bear two or three social obligations every month is really stretching us thin and putting us in a dilemma. How would the happy wedding couple know the suffering of us teachers?

I remember when we were young, the gifts given to teachers were often returned afterwards. Now, times are different. Who would still be willing to follow those old rules? Has anyone who once advocated for respecting teachers have any solutions to this problem?

### ### Appeal to Xin Ya Library to Open on Sundays

Editor: Libraries are institutions that serve human culture, and their duty is to serve. Xin Ya's constituents are mostly working youths, and it naturally seeks to benefit working youths. However, Xin Ya's opening days are different from those of Liangcai Era (open on Sundays, closed on Mondays). We live in Shanghai's east, working in factories, unable to leave our jobs from morning till night, and only have Sundays off, which coincides with the library's closing days. Therefore, delays in borrowing and returning books are inevitable, and fines are unavoidable. If we ask for leave to borrow and return books, we will also have our wages deducted by the factory. In this way, not only is our spirit greatly harmed, but the material waste we suffer is also significant. Today, all parties are working hard to promote the cultural movement, and Xin Ya, one of the six major libraries bearing the cultural fortress of the city, will surely sympathize with the plight of countless young people bound by their occupations and make changes. We would be most fortunate. Respectfully, Rong Zhen, Chen Hua, Wen Da, Gan Bao, Ji Ying, sincerely.

### ### Sailing Through Storms Together

— He Jia Zhi

(10) Flying Peak

Huanglong walked into the east room and carried over the three or four mirror frames piled in the corner of the room. Weicheng compared the sizes and found that they were only one or two centimeters smaller than the original frames for the photos. So he replaced the frames of Mrs. Hua's photo with the same frames, while also wiping the glass clean and replacing the ropes with new ones. Cuizhen walked in from inside and smiled, "Brother Cheng, what are you busy with? We're not inviting her to Shide Hall until tomorrow." Huanglong told her that he had already changed the frames, and Cuizhen smiled again, "If you take it down tomorrow, won't you break the glass?" Weicheng had a matter on his mind, and when he saw Cuizhen smiling, he only showed an unnatural smile to appease her. At that time, he placed the two framed photos on the table and urged Huanglong and Cuizhen to go to bed.

Weicheng groped alone to the previous bedroom, turned on the light, and compared the photo of Chen Guofang hanging on the wall with the photo of Cheng Bing in his arms, which filled him with sadness, anger, and frustration. Looking at Guofang and Cheng Bing, between their brows and mouths, they looked alike everywhere, which confirmed that Cheng Bing was Chen Guoqi and Chen Guofang's father; even if he wasn't the father, Chen Guoqi and Chen Guofang must all be Cheng Bing's illegitimate children. If it were said that Cheng Bing was siblings with Guoqi, they would also be siblings, but the age wouldn't match. He couldn't understand why Cheng Bing's surname was Cheng, while Guoqi's surname was Chen. These many thoughts were turning in Weicheng's mind like a pulley, and he inadvertently muttered. He didn't realize it himself, but Huanglong pushed in and suddenly grabbed Weicheng, saying, "You let others go to sleep, but you don't want to sleep yourself. Ah, who is this woman? Isn't it Miss Chen? I understand everything. So you were thinking about Miss Chen, no wonder you don't want Sister Cuizhen haha." (End of this section) (222)
