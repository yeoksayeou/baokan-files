London, 15th (Reuters) - The diplomatic correspondent of The Times reports that the governments of China, India, the United States, New Zealand, and Australia are considering a new strategy for Allied joint operations in the Pacific. A conference will be held in the near future to discuss adjustments to the Pacific war effort's organizational structure, as well as changes in staff, due to the shifting war situation. The conference will likely be held in Washington. Australia and India are to be rapidly developed as strong Allied counter-offensive bases. The Australian government has dispatched Foreign Minister Dr. Evatt to Washington. Before Dr. Evatt arrives, no final decisions will be made regarding the new organization and strategy of the Pacific war effort. He may then proceed to London to represent Australia in the British Imperial War Cabinet, succeeding Sir Page.

London, 15th (Reuters) - Australian High Commissioner to the UK, Mr. Page, declared last night that both Australia and India urgently need reinforcements, requiring more warships, transport ships, food, and munitions, more fighter planes, bombers, transport planes, and training aircraft, various types of artillery, and light and heavy tanks, and especially the guidance of capable and decisive military commanders, saying, "We will fight to the death and never give up an inch of land."

### Joint Anglo-American Announcement: Details of the Battle of the Java Sea; Twelve Allied Ships Lost, Admiral Doorman Presumed Dead

Lisbon, 15th (Haitong News Agency) - According to news from Washington, the naval departments of the United Kingdom and the United States issued a joint communiqué yesterday, stating that the Allied navy lost twelve cruisers and destroyers in the naval battle near Surabaya on February 27.

London, 15th (Reuters) - It is reported that Allied fleet commander Rear Admiral Doorman is feared to have died in the Battle of the Java Sea. The admiral was 53 years old and originally served as the commander of the Netherlands East Indies Naval Aviation Force before being transferred to command the fleet.

London, 15th (Reuters) - The Admiralty announced last night the details of the Battle of the Java Sea, stating that while a complete report on the events surrounding the battle of February 27th has not yet been compiled, it can be said that on that afternoon, the Allied force, consisting of the Australian cruiser HMAS Perth, the British cruiser HMS Exeter, the American cruiser USS Houston, and the Dutch cruisers HNLMS De Ruyter and HNLMS Java, was stationed north of Surabaya. This cruiser force was protected by British destroyers HMS Electra, HMS Jupiter, HMS Encounter, and the Dutch cruiser HNLMS Kortenaer. The fleet was commanded by Rear Admiral Doorman. At 4:14 PM, this fleet made contact with the Japanese fleet, which immediately attacked with its destroyer force. The Allied cruiser force also opened fire in response. Shortly thereafter, another Japanese destroyer force launched torpedoes. Although the Allied ships attempted to evade them, the British cruiser HMS Exeter was hit by an 8-inch torpedo and withdrew from the battle line. Subsequently, the Dutch cruiser HNLMS Kortenaer was sunk. At this point, the three British destroyers were ordered to counter-attack, but the results are unknown. However, HMS Electra disappeared into the smoke screen and is believed to have been lost. Admiral Doorman, aboard his flagship HNLMS De Ruyter, led his force to the northeast but failed to make contact with the Japanese fleet. In the evening, the Allied cruiser force sighted several Japanese ships and engaged them, but the results are also unknown. Admiral Doorman then planned to lead his force to the rear of the Japanese fleet in the hope of attacking the Japanese transport ships, but was unsuccessful because the Japanese ships were moving very quickly. He then led his force south, closer to the Java coast, and then southwest along the coast in the hope of intercepting the Japanese transport ships. Half an hour later, HMS Jupiter was severely damaged by a torpedo and sank after four hours. At 11:30 PM, the Allied cruisers sighted the Japanese cruiser force about 12 miles north of Rembang, already between the Allied fleet and the Java coast. Both sides immediately engaged in battle. HNLMS De Ruyter was hit by a torpedo and, in order to avoid further torpedoes, made a large turn. As the Allied ships re-formed their line, HNLMS De Ruyter and HNLMS Java were simultaneously hit by torpedoes and exploded, sinking. The extent of Japanese losses cannot be confirmed. The Australian cruiser HMAS Perth sustained considerable damage and returned to port at 7:00 AM on the 28th. By this point, the Japanese had achieved absolute air and sea superiority north of Java. That night, HMAS Perth attempted to pass through the Sunda Strait under cover of darkness, but it is reported that it encountered several Japanese ships around 11:30 PM. Contact with this ship and the American ship USS Houston has since been lost. Meanwhile, HMS Exeter, escorted by the destroyer HMS Encounter and the American destroyer USS Pope, sailed out of Surabaya. On the morning of March 1st, HMS Exeter reported sighting several Japanese cruisers approaching to attack. There have been no reports since then. The extent of Japanese losses is also unknown.

Naval Balance of Power Severely Affected

Washington, 15th (Reuters) - The heavy losses suffered by the Allied fleet in the Battle of the Java Sea have made a deep impression here. The naval balance of power in the Pacific has been severely affected. The earlier belief that the Japanese air force was useless has already been disproven, and the subsequent belief that the Japanese navy was incompetent has now also proven to be the opposite of the truth. One Must Know How to Choose Between Butter and Cannons

London, 15th (Reuters) - General James, Commander of the Portsmouth Fortress, declared yesterday that the Battle of the Java Sea two weeks ago was the fiercest and bloodiest battle in history.

Today, we must know how to choose between building ships quickly and losing everything we love.

### Germany Amasses Large Forces on the Eastern Front, Preparing to Launch Offensive; Five Soviet Divisions Counter-Attack German Positions, Intensifying Fighting on the Southern Front

Stockholm, Sweden, 14th (Havas) - The Dagens Nyheter recently published a dispatch from its London correspondent, stating that, according to British military sources, the German forces amassed on the Soviet front for their spring offensive will number no fewer than 280 divisions. It is questionable whether the Soviet Red Army will launch an early counter-offensive to disrupt the German preparations currently underway.

Istanbul, Turkey, 15th (Reuters) - According to visitors from Turkey yesterday, two German divisions have recently passed through Romania on their way to the Soviet front. The majority of these troops have been redeployed from Greece.

Berlin, 15th (Haitong News Agency) - It was announced here last night that large Soviet forces attacked the front lines of the Kerch Peninsula the day before, but were repelled by our forces. The attacking Soviet force consisted of approximately five divisions and 80 tanks. Soviet artillery provided strong support, firing at least 20,000 rounds. German forces resisted and engaged in hand-to-hand combat, resulting in the destruction of 46 enemy tanks and heavy casualties among Soviet soldiers.

Berlin, 15th (Haitong News Agency) - A German official yesterday released the following supplementary war report to a Haitong News Agency reporter: Fighting on the Crimean front in the East has intensified again. Although the Soviet forces launched fierce attacks, they were repeatedly repulsed with heavy losses by our forces. Romanian troops fought alongside German troops and were very successful in defensive battles. The weather in the central sector of the Eastern Front remains cold, which has a significant impact. However, the German Air Force remains very active.

Stockholm, Sweden, 14th (Havas) - Soviet forces on the northern sector of the Eastern Front attacked Chudovo on the 9th of this month. German forces launched a counter-offensive north of Gruzino, inflicting heavy losses on the Soviet forces. The front line has now been restored to the Volkhov River line. The Soviet forces are currently attempting to maintain several bridgeheads on the west bank of the river.

### Germany and Italy Sign Economic Agreement to Increase Raw Material Trade Volume and Promote Military Production in Both Countries

Rome, 14th (Havas) - Germany and Italy signed an economic agreement today to increase the volume of raw material trade between the two countries in 1942, thereby promoting armaments production. Specifically, Germany will increase its exports of coal and steel to Italy, and there will be no restrictions on exports of military necessities due to payment issues. In addition, Germany and Italy, when discussing the shipment of supplies to Greece, decided to make every effort to reduce the country's financial burden.

Berlin, 14th (Havas) - Economic figures here took the opportunity of the signing of the new German-Italian economic agreement to review the commercial achievements of both sides, stating that the total trade volume between the two countries in 1941 exceeded 10 billion marks. Italy's exports mainly consisted of fruits, vegetables, flax, raw silk, rayon, lead, mercury, and food, while Germany exported coal, iron, machinery, military supplies, chemicals, and medicines to Italy. The amount of coal alone reached more than one million tons per month, setting a new record for railway transportation. It is expected that this year will see further increases. In addition, there are currently 200,000 Italian workers serving in Germany, remitting approximately one million marks per day to their families back home. In short, Germany has made efforts to increase Italy's exports to Germany. Now, Germany can not only obtain large quantities of food from Italy but also important military raw materials.

### Germany Commemorates Fallen Soldiers; Hitler Delivers Speech

Berlin, 15th (Haitong News Agency) - Today is Germany's Memorial Day for Fallen Soldiers. Führer Hitler delivered a speech this afternoon, solemnly vowing that Germany and its allies would continue to fight until the enemy forces were annihilated. He predicted that the Soviet forces would be defeated, and perhaps even annihilated, this summer. He also stated that the German and allied forces, after a severe winter of ice and snow, continue their efforts, demonstrating their unwavering strength. In the future, communism will not be allowed to gain a foothold in Europe. In 1918, British, French, and American politicians, driven by madness, insisted that Germany should not be allowed to restore its economic prosperity or enjoy equal rights in economic life under any circumstances. Based on this misunderstanding, various unjust measures were taken. The German people, who had already lost confidence, could not change their misfortune. It must be understood that passively accepting fate will never lead to escaping misfortune. Only through unity and persistent struggle can it be destroyed. The German people are the most hardworking and capable people. The decline of the German economy is not beneficial to the enemy. After Germany becomes impoverished, other countries will not immediately become prosperous. Therefore, the capitalist countries controlled by the Jews also suffer from unemployment, and even the number of unemployed people is greater than in Germany. However, since the people of those countries are blinded by suspicion and only follow the lead of the Jews, it is appropriate that they remain misguided. After the National Socialists came to power, they still did not know to emulate Germany's measures in the economic and social spheres, but only harped on old grievances, making various propaganda and inciting the people to prepare for another war. And now, we all know that in 1935 and 1936, powerful Jews and political leaders in Britain, France, and the United States had already decided to fight again. But this should be blamed on the people of those countries for not resisting this mad attempt and for condemning the lack of military preparations. After all proposals by Germany regarding disarmament and the abolition of armaments were rejected, it had no choice but to engage in military preparations in order to cope with a second war so as not to repeat the mistakes of the 1914 World War. Therefore, when we commemorated the fallen soldiers in 1940, we had already won the initial victory in the war and had the greatest confidence in maintaining victory in the second stage of the war. In fact, the war in the year up to March 1941 created an unparalleled feat in history. In the wars in Northern and Western Europe, Europe had defeated the enemy forces on the continent, and Italy had joined our side as our loyal comrade to fight this war of survival. Today, the Jews who control politics in the world have united, linking democracy with Bolshevism, attempting a collective attack, thinking that all of Europe can be destroyed by them. Fortunately, heaven has blessed us, allowing us to win victories on all battlefields against Jewish Marxism and capitalism. We must be grateful to God, for if not for God's blessing on our people, our diligence and courage would have been in vain. The past year has not only witnessed the largest battle in world history but has also given us the most difficult training. This training is not only on the front lines but also in our own country. Based on German history, it proves that the German people are not afraid of the threats of others. In this war, the German people must not only contend with the enemy's weapons and the enemy's inexhaustible forces, but also fight against cruel nature. The severe cold of last winter was unprecedented in Central and Eastern Europe for 140 years. The Allied forces of the Axis powers have shown their resilience in the past four months despite all the hardships. After gaining victory in the Balkans in 1941, the German forces entered the Soviet Union, repeatedly winning battles and establishing meritorious services. The retreating enemy was repeatedly defeated, and many were annihilated. The depth of the German and allied forces' entry into the enemy's territory and the breadth of the territory occupied are unprecedented. The great achievements are enough to be remembered for thousands of years. Now that the severe winter has passed, we are even more confident in defeating the enemy. If the Soviet forces could not defeat the Allied forces last winter, it is difficult to guarantee that they will not be annihilated by the Allied forces this summer. We will expel the Soviet Union far away, so that it cannot border us in Europe. We feel the greatness of the era we live in. The world is being rebuilt. In East Asia, the Japanese people have been bullied and their economy has been suppressed, and now they are launching attacks by sea, land, and air, destroying the walls of democracy and capitalism. In short, hundreds of millions of hardworking, resilient, and highly cultured people can hardly bear to live under the control of a few Jews and capitalists and tolerate it for a long time. Therefore, the only solution is to fight until lasting peace is guaranteed. In other words, it must wait until the enemies of peace are all annihilated before a satisfactory conclusion can be reached. Countries outside Europe continue to have attempts to interfere in European affairs, especially to meddle in our affairs. Now their attempts have been prevented by us once and for all.

### Various Pawnshops in Shanghai Increase Interest Rates

From 2.5 Fen to 3 Fen. Pawnshops in Shanghai are divided into pawnshops and pledge shops, similar to the distinction between remittance houses and currency exchange shops in the money industry.

According to a reporter from Datong News Agency who inquired with the Pawnshop Association yesterday, the industry has increased its monthly interest rate from 2.5 fen to 3 fen per yuan starting this year. Due to the continuous increase in prices in recent years, the value of goods at maturity often exceeds the loan principal by several times, so the business situation has improved. In particular, pledge shops are more profitable.

### Discovered a Gang of Robbers; Various Prison Sentences

The notorious robbers, Qi Jiafa, Xu Ronggui, Zhang Jinsheng, Zhang Shou, etc., all from Jiangbei, colluded as a gang and used weapons to rob Zhang Gao's family at No. 16 Gordon Road, and passersby on Xiaoshadu Road, Macau Road, Robison Road, Caoxiebang and other places, stealing belongings and stripping off overcoats and cotton robes worth over two thousand yuan in national currency from November of last year to February of this year. After the case was exposed, they were arrested by the Chinese detective Shang Wu and detective Li Wenzhao of the Putuo Road Police Station one after another. They recovered an overcoat (lined with Yuan satin) and a camel wool cotton robe, worth over five hundred yuan, and brought them to the police station. They were prosecuted for the crime of armed robbery in collusion according to criminal law. The case was judged yesterday, with Qi Jiafa, Xu Ronggui, and Zhang Jinsheng each sentenced to five years in prison, Zhang Shou to four years, and the suspect Wei Qishi acquitted.

As for whether the child was a victim of harm or abandoned by parents unable to raise him, the French police are currently investigating the origin.

### Coal Briquette Merchants Have a Solution: Increase Distribution Quantity; Shutdown of Seven Coal Briquette Factories Affects Supply

In light of the fact that coal briquettes are an indispensable fuel for both rich and poor residents on a daily basis, and that a shortage or cessation of sales would not only affect residents' cooking but also cause public unrest, major coal companies in the city have been actively discussing solutions to restore the normal distribution of coal briquettes. According to inquiries with the coal industry yesterday, each coal company has a solution for coal briquette suppliers. Starting yesterday, coal briquette factories such as Yitaixing, Guohua, and Nanyang increased the distribution quantity to each retail store, approximately doubling the quantity compared to the past few days, and further increases are expected.

Factories That Have Stopped Production Have Not Yet Resumed

Due to insufficient coal dust reserves, various coal briquette factories have successively reduced production. The Guanghua and China factories were forced to cease production of coal briquettes. It is understood that the Nanyang (Binlang Road), Beiyang, Yuanhua, Dongfang, Yuedong, and Nanyang branch (Tokyo Road) factories have also successively stopped making briquettes due to various reasons. The cessation of production by these factories has had a significant impact on the supply of coal briquettes.

Forced to Close Due to Lack of Goods for Sale

Since the mechanized coal briquette factories successively reduced production, a serious panic has arisen in the city's fuel supply. Thousands of retail stores have been unable to obtain large quantities of coal briquettes for sale at their stores, leading to a situation where they have reached their limits. However, in order to ensure the future of fuel supply and facilitate residents' purchases, each business is reluctantly maintaining the status quo, restricting sales to the amount of coal briquettes they are able to obtain each day. According to news from the coal industry yesterday, it is becoming increasingly difficult for coal, firewood, and charcoal stores to maintain their operations. Those with smaller capital have already been forced to close. Only if the factories can provide a large supply can sales be restored.

### Census of the Chinese Area Completed

Total of 1.58 Million People

In addition, the French Concession has a population of over 800,000, and the Huxi area is estimated to have a population of over 200,000. Combined, the total population of Shanghai is still over 4 million. Before the Pacific War, the total population of Shanghai was generally estimated to be over 5 million. According to these figures, over the past three months, more than 500,000 people have voluntarily or been scattered and left Shanghai. This evacuation movement has continued in the past few days, and with the soaring prices and cost of living, the number of evacuees has increased. Every morning, the wharves along the Bund are crowded with residents returning to their hometowns.

### Shanghai Catholic Diocese Celebrates 100th Anniversary; Launches a Movement to Renew the Lives of Catholics from March 5th to April 5th

A significant record in the history of Catholicism in China during the mid-19th century is the second arrival of Jesuit missionaries in Jiangnan, occurring in the 22nd year of the Daoguang Emperor, on the eve of the establishment of the Treaty of Nanjing between China and Britain, exactly one hundred years ago. St. Ignatius Cathedral in Xujiahui, Shanghai, will be holding celebrations this month to commemorate the "100th Anniversary of the Shanghai Diocese," promoting a "Movement to Renew the Lives of Catholics."

Catholicism was first introduced into China in the late 13th century, with a difficult and arduous journey lasting three centuries. It was not until the late 16th century, with the arrival of Matteo Ricci in China, that the Jesuits established a foundation for their missionary work in the Jiangnan region in modern times.

Many missionary societies within Catholicism are groups of various religious orders, all belonging to the one universal Catholic Church, unlike the Anglican Church and Presbyterian Church in the Lutheran Protestant tradition, each with its own distinct identity. There are currently dozens of Catholic missionary societies working in China, among which the Dominican Order, the Paris Foreign Missions Society, the Franciscan Order, the Vincentian Order, and the Jesuit Order have a long history and outstanding achievements. The Jesuit Order was disbanded in Europe in the mid-18th century, and its missionary work in China also ceased until the order was restored in 1814. On July 11, 1842, the Jesuit Order returned to China, establishing the headquarters for the revival of the Shanghai Diocese in Xujiahui, Shanghai.

Bishop Gislain of the Shanghai Diocese has been preparing since the year before last to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the Jesuits' second arrival in China. Originally, he intended to hold a grand celebration, but due to the impact of the war, he decided to forgo external activities and focus on spiritual commemoration. From March 5th to April 5th, Easter, a month-long movement to renew the lives of Catholics is being promoted within the Xujiahui Cathedral. The schedule is as follows:

(March 5th to 8th) Children's Retreat; (8th) Opening of the Renewal Movement; (8th to 14th) Renewal Week for Female Catholics; (15th) Renewal Vigor Day; (15th to 21st) Renewal Week for Male Catholics; (22nd) Renewal Prayer Association Day; (22nd to 24th) Retreat for Members of the Holy Mother Association; (23rd) Diocesan Commemoration Day for the Deceased; (23rd to 28th) Staff Training; (24th) Holy Mother Association Members Day; (29th) Public Society Members Day; (April 1st) Holy Eucharist Army Day; (5th) Closing of the Renewal Movement

The Renewal Week for Female Catholics has already been held. From March 15th to 21st, it is the week for male Catholics. Preaching takes place in Ignatius Cathedral at 7:45 a.m., 1:15 p.m., and 7:50 p.m. daily. The topics are: "The Meaning of the Renewal Week," "Life Dissection," "A Glimpse of Eternity," "Death Management," "Review of Life," "Adjustment of Life," "Renewal of Life," "The Essence of the Three Theological Virtues," "Service and Duty Spirit," "Preaching and Saving People Spirit," and so on.

Statistics for the Shanghai Catholic Diocese show that there are currently 140,000 male and female believers. The church has commendable achievements in social services such as education, charity, science, and publishing. Compared to a hundred years ago, there have been very remarkable contributions and achievements.

The Shanghai Catholic Diocese has experienced many obstacles and hardships in the past hundred years, but thanks to the hard work of the missionaries and the concerted efforts of the believers, it still has a thriving spirit. Bishop Yu, the leader of the Shanghai Diocese, earnestly explained to the tens of thousands of Catholics in Shanghai in the public letter "Renewing Life": "When suffering from the severe oppression of war, we must firmly believe that our souls are immortal. No matter what suffering or happiness we experience in this world, it will soon pass. Only the eternal bliss of heaven or the eternal suffering of hell after death is permanent. True justice is usually not found in this world, but only before the judgment seat of the all-just God, where the reward and punishment for good and evil are perfectly clear." "The miraculous governance of God's wisdom always uses the disasters and hardships of the physical body to refine us. The war has affected our diocese, and not only does this bishop lament the significant losses and difficulties, but also cares about the various sufferings of your families and individuals. But you must not be discouraged. On the contrary, this bishop exhorts you to cheer up and renew your Catholic lives!" (Guest Contributor)

### Portuguese Community Establishes Central Association; Plans Far-Reaching Projects to Assist Portuguese Nationals Facing Hardship

According to the English-language "China Times", this newspaper's reporters have learned that the Portuguese community in this city has established a "Central Association of Portuguese Nationals" to assist Portuguese citizens whose living conditions have become difficult. The Association has drafted far-reaching plans, and the Concession authorities have pledged to cooperate with it. The Association is chaired by the Portuguese Minister to China, Mr. Lema, who formulated concrete plans to establish the Association at his residence on January 7th, thus formally setting up the relief organization.

The Association Is Intended to Be Permanent

At the time, the Minister stated that the association he was preparing was not only a charitable organization or an emergency relief agency to deal with temporary crises. The formation of this association is intended to be permanent and valuable in the coming months, and will continue to exist after the situation stabilizes to address the needs of the Portuguese community. While all efforts should be made to address the current difficulties at the outset, the future is even more important and should not be neglected.

The Goal Is to Seek the Welfare of the Portuguese Community

The purpose of the Association is to study and implement various measures beneficial to the entire Portuguese community. The Association is determined to focus all its activities to achieve maximum results with minimum effort. The permanent nature of the Association necessitates that it study issues related to improving the community's knowledge and cultural level. The Association hopes to provide the Portuguese community in this city with a stronger defense, enabling it to cope with any new situations that may arise.

Closely Studying Living Problems

Among the issues the Association is currently studying closely are employment, education, food, clothing, and shelter. The Association is attempting to obtain large quantities of staple foods so that the Portuguese community can enjoy the benefits of bulk purchases. The establishment of public kitchens is also under careful consideration. If successful, this could help Portuguese households solve the problems of cook wages, fuel costs, and waste. However, the establishment of public kitchens depends entirely on adequate support and will be decided after the statistical tables have been compiled.

All Portuguese Adults Are Welcome to Join

The Association is completely open to all Portuguese nationals in Shanghai. All Portuguese adults can apply for membership by filling out the blank forms sent to them. The Association also earnestly requests the community's cooperation in providing all the information requested. The Association is very willing to explain and clarify matters related to its work, and has therefore established an information department that will communicate the Association's activities to all members. Mr. Gratus has been selected as the chairman of the Association, with Mr. Su Shi serving as the secretary-general.

### Hometown Association Commemorates Han Zishi; Ceremony Scheduled for the 26th of This Month

Mr. Han Zishi of Hai'an was revered in his time for his morality and writing. In recent years, his work in water management and disaster relief, as well as his promotion of industrial enterprises, have been widely recognized. He passed away last winter. Elderly members of his hometown association here, considering his contributions to his homeland, intend to posthumously confer a private title on him to express their respect and appreciation for his merit. The public memorial service is scheduled for the 26th of this month at Jing'an Temple. Friends of Mr. Han who wish to attend may proceed directly to the temple at 2:00 p.m. that afternoon to participate in the preliminary ceremony.

### Increased Mortality Rate; Promotion of Cleanliness; Strict Implementation of Rat Control Measures

The Health Department of the French Municipal Council announced that the number of deaths in the French Concession in February increased slightly compared to January, by approximately 22 percent. This is entirely due to the increase in the number of deaths among drug addicts. The number of corpses collected by the Tongren Fuyuan Hall in February increased by 9 percent. There was also a significant increase in infectious diseases last month. This is due to diseases transmitted by lice. Relapsing fever has been found among both foreigners and Chinese, with one-third of Chinese patients dying. Typhoid fever has also occurred. Both colds and meningitis are also noteworthy. The incidence of typhoid fever appears to be increasing, so preventive measures must be taken in advance, especially during April and May. The authorities are now promoting personal hygiene and plan to take strict measures to eliminate rats, such as tightly closing garbage can lids, installing rat-proofing equipment in houses, blocking wall holes and crevices, using rat traps and rat poison, and encouraging the keeping of cats and dogs that catch rats. As for the vaccination campaign, it is continuing smoothly, and 49,383 people have already been vaccinated. The Health Department is also taking advantage of the opportunity of Chinese people lining up to buy rice to administer vaccinations.

### Reward Offered to Find Missing Girl; Scoundrel Lies to Obtain Money

Li Wang, a woman from Ningbo residing at No. 9, Lane 306, North Henan Road, reported that her six-year-old daughter, Jinlan, disappeared suddenly while playing in front of her house at 11:30 a.m. the day before yesterday. She searched everywhere without success. Distressed, she posted notices on various roads, offering a reward of 100 yuan to anyone who returned her daughter. At 2:00 p.m. that afternoon, Zhu Fenlan, a 19-year-old youth from Gaoyou, went to her house and falsely claimed that he knew Li's daughter, Jinlan, was at Wang Anzi's house at No. 6 Ouyang Road in Zhabei, intending to fraudulently obtain the reward of 100 yuan. Li reported this to Chinese Constable No. 1333 of the Huisi Police Station, who arrested him and investigated the address at No. 6 Ouyang Road, but found no such person as Wang Anzi. Zhu then claimed that Li's daughter might be hiding somewhere on Xinza Road, but a search there also revealed no trace of Li's daughter. He was taken to the police station and prosecuted for the crimes of kidnapping a young girl and fraudulent acquisition of property, and detained pending investigation.

Treating Childhood Pneumonia: Children are most susceptible to pneumonia. Western medicine often uses Anfook Ointment to treat it. Although it is effective in most cases, the medicine is extremely expensive. Years ago, one of my children suffered from pneumonia and was treated by Western medicine, applying ointment and injections, but to no avail and the child eventually died. A friend, Mr. Yao, also had a two-year-old daughter suffering from pneumonia. Initially, he sought treatment from a Western doctor, but the condition worsened. He switched to a Chinese doctor, but both said there was no hope. An old woman orally imparted a secret remedy: Use a live clam, drill a small hole in it, stir it with a silver needle, drip the clam juice into a porcelain cup, steam it over water, and feed the lukewarm clam juice to the child. The illness will be cured. I wish to borrow a corner of your newspaper to make this public to the world, a blessing for children. Respectfully, Huang Yabo. 13th. (Service Column Note: Childhood pneumonia must be treated with reliable scientific medicine. If treatment is ineffective, it can only be attributed to science not yet being fully developed. As for secret remedies, we still hope that their effectiveness can be scientifically proven. We hope that physicians will study why the above treatment is effective.)

In recent days, we have received letters signed "Shanghai East Refugees," "A Group in Need of Assistance," "Resident of a Certain Place," etc. Regardless of whether the content is related to public welfare, because there are no addresses or real names, according to the submission guidelines of this column, we regret that we cannot publish them.

### Hequn Fundraising Football, Act II: Golden Lion and Hequn Both Triumph; Xuhui and Zhendan Suffer Defeats

The second act of the Hequn fundraising football match was held at the Zhendan Stadium at 2:15 p.m. yesterday, with 3,000 spectators. In the first match, Golden Lion played against Xuhui, with Han Yin Sheng as the referee. Xuhui performed weaker than before, while Golden Lion seemed full of energy. Since Han Longhai scored a penalty kick to open the scoring, Xuhui's counterattack was ineffective. Han Longhai of Golden Lion then broke through the enemy's net again from 20 yards out. In the first half, Golden Lion led 2-0. After the break, it was still Golden Lion's game. Old Han was the bravest of the three armies, scoring three more goals. Finally, Fu Naitang went on a solo run and attacked the enemy's base again. In conclusion, Golden Lion defeated Xuhui 4-0.

### An Unlucky Black Cat and Similar Things

— Zizang

According to the London "Evening Standard": "A black cat named Oscar was first kept on the warship Bismarck, which sank. It was then transferred to the British warship Cossack, which was also sunk not long after. The cat was rescued again and kept on the Royal Ark warship, but unexpectedly that warship also sank. The cat is now being kept in a sailor's home." This black cat is indeed very strange. Who would disagree with giving it the elegant title of "Unlucky Cat"? In the past, Napoleon dominated the world, a glorious figure. However, amidst military dispatches and strategic planning, it is said that he feared nothing but black cats. Black cats seem incomparable to icy landscapes and scorched-earth tactics. Why was he so afraid? Is it because their murky fur and sneaky demeanor are somewhat ungenerous? Or is it the "meow" sound, a bit like the "strangling cats" sound of modern women, that inevitably makes one's hair stand on end, causing hundreds of thousands of men to lay down their arms? This is truly impossible to guess, but Napoleon's fear of black cats has since become a beautiful tale in history, quite poetic. This time, there was actually an Oscar the black cat wandering on both sides' warships, resulting in the sinking of both warships. This cat is simply too miraculous. But a cat is just a cat. It doesn't seem to have three heads, six arms, or full armor. Nor is it like the "Helen" of ancient times, a target of contention. Fortunately, it happened to be there, ultimately proving the black cat's "misfortune," not due to human failure. That's all. This cat not only saved its life but also has the feeling of "one general succeeding while ten thousand bones wither." It's not called any old cat or dog, but Oscar, the same name as the 19th-century poet Oscar Wilde, showing that it is no ordinary thing. Human achievements cannot be erased after all. Civilized countries dig air-raid shelters during wartime and must also prepare a few cat and dog air-raid shelters. This leisureliness shows that it is not just going through the motions, giving us the feeling of "better to be a cat in troubled times than a person in peaceful times." In this time and place, black or white cats and black and white dogs, becoming "immortal products," are often different. They don't seem to have been given the honorable title of "unlucky." Although A-grade milk is only a privilege for patients, cats and dogs lying in their owners' arms still have fur as shiny as their mistresses' fingernails. What's difficult are ordinary cats and dogs. Rats are being sent back to their hometowns every day, and rice has reached around 600. They can only become dead cats and dogs. However, do you want to pray to our Lord Jesus? Not necessary. Just look at the corpses on the street of people who have taken grains for a long time without becoming immortals, and you can remain silent for three minutes.

Unlucky things in the world do not seem to be the "patent" of Oscar. To turn weapons into silk and misfortune into great fortune, you might as well "order" the black cat to go to the North Pole, the South Pole, or Mount Everest for a period of rest. However, I want to imitate a line from an ancient poem: "... (the first line is forgotten, to be investigated.) How can a concubine in the deep palace know?" and chant: "... How can the cat in my arms know!"

### Anecdotes from Film City

— Xinjuan

In addition to the existing "Oomph Girl" Ann Sheridan, Warner Bros. has recently discovered a new "Oomph Girl" named Georgia Carroll. Her "oomph" style is comparable to Paramount's Veronica Lake. Cary Grant, the star of "Suspicion," is a Hollywood bachelor who is currently in love with Betsy Drake. However, their "romance" is kept secret. Susan Hayward has only starred in "Among the Living" after appearing on the screen as "One Generation Music Saint." She recently starred in "Glamour Boy" with Jackie Cooper.

Maureen O'Hara's divorce case has not yet been decided, and she has already received over a hundred proposals. Maureen has been on intimate terms with director Will Price, and marriage is possible.

A photo of Clark Gable ten years ago looks similar to Fernandel today. Believe it or not.

Random Talk About the Arts

### Brand Tune

— Ze Fu

Brand Tune, also known as Zapai Tune, is one of the miscellaneous northern tunes. It is named so because it is composed of various miscellaneous small tunes. There are about sixty types of these brands (i.e., melodies), some originating from old tunes, such as "Luo Jiang Yuan" and "Yi Shua Hai'er" from Southern tunes, "Ji Niu Cao" and "Ku Huang Tian" from Northern tunes. The rest are new tunes created by the Qing people, or mixed with tunes from Dagushu, Kuaishu, Zidishu, Peking Opera, and Bangzi Opera, resulting in a particularly complex style. Each set of brand tunes has no fixed pattern for combining the various brands. It is entirely up to the singer to string them together as appropriate for the situation. Typically, it consists of five or six brands for short sets, and twenty or thirty for longer ones. Each set begins with "Shu Chang," which uses a spoken tone to rapidly recite rhymed phrases, and ends with "Qu Wei," which is similar to the epilogue in ancient tunes. The songs mostly depict love or social trivialities, such as "Du Shiniang," "Jinshan Temple," and "Mother-in-law and Daughter-in-law Arguing." Some include spoken parts, such as "Gao Lao Zhuang." The instruments used during singing, besides the Sanxian, often include the singer shaking an octagonal drum. Therefore, the so-called octagonal drum in the Dagushu performance is mostly used to sing this type of brand tune. Moreover, because there are so many of these brands, which are frequently exchanged, singing is more difficult than other miscellaneous tunes, so women do not learn them very much.

### Three Types of People

— Qin Ren

It is said that the people of Shanghai today can be divided into three types: upper, middle, and lower:

The upper class is composed of those who made a fortune during speculative surges, or are still continuing to speculate, and have abundant reserves of rice, coal, and oil, so they don't have to worry about "three squeezes" a day.

The middle class is composed of small well-to-do families or wealthy absentee landlords, who adhere to the principle of "tightening belts" in all expenses. For example, the after-dinner Mei Qi mandarin oranges have been canceled, but the three meat dishes, one vegetable dish, and one soup are still maintained as before.

The last class is also the most numerous kind now. They have no jobs in Shanghai and no land in the countryside, so they are in a situation of "unable to stay and unable to leave."

Heavenly Chef's Cookbook (92)

### (163) Sweet Corn Rice (Fan)

— Draft by Liu Xian

Ingredients: Corn, glutinous rice, MSG, white sugar

Preparation: Soak the measured glutinous rice in cold water overnight. The next morning, simmer the corn until tender, then add water to bring it to a boil. Immediately pour in the glutinous rice and cook together, adding an appropriate amount of sugar and MSG. Once the rice is cooked thoroughly, it can be served and eaten. The taste is very fresh and delicious. (Note: If you add more glutinous rice and cook for a while to make porridge, then add sugar and MSG, it becomes sweet corn rice porridge.)

### (164) Stir-fried Corn with Sauce (Cai)

— Draft by Liu Xian

Ingredients: Corn, fresh meat, dried tofu, sweet sauce, oil, Tianchu Soy Sauce Essence, wine

Preparation: Put the corn in a pot and dry-fry. Separately, cut the fresh meat and dried tofu into small cubes, add them to the oil and stir-fry. At the same time, add salt, soy sauce essence, wine, and other seasonings to blend. Add a little more water and simmer for a while, then add the corn and stir-fry with sweet sauce. When it is dry, it is ready. At this point, the corn is both fragrant and delicious.

Announcement (1): Since this cookbook has been published periodically, it has made some contributions to various families and has been praised by readers.

Announcement (2): "MSG," "Wei Zong," "Tianchu Soy Sauce Essence," and "Tianchu Household Arrowroot Flour" produced by Tianchu MSG Factory are available for sale in major companies and Southern goods food stores in this city.

### Contemporary Observations

— Ya Ding

In Charlie Chaplin's "Modern Times," the distressing situation of mechanized eating makes people laugh and cry. Recently, the price of rice has climbed to a peak of 650, and some sporadic movements in the market can be recorded:

A friend told me that a small single-room rice shop in the French Concession sold more than 5,000 yuan worth of various types of beans, including green, yellow, red, white, and black, in one day on Saturday. The store was crowded all day long, and at the end of the night, the profit was at least equal to three complete pages of the "Book of Poetry."

The suffering of pressing coal briquettes is even worse than pressing rice. One is a soft material. Everyone carries cloth bags in their hands, pushing and squeezing each other. No matter how much "effort" is put in, there is no risk of "hard injuries." Only the coal briquettes are loaded into "boxes," either bamboo rice baskets or tinplate dung buckets. If one is not careful, the skin breaks and bleeds. The day before yesterday, I passed by a place and saw a thirteen or fourteen-year-old child whose head and face were cut by a bamboo basket in someone else's hand. The pain of the skin is so unbearable.

A certain relative joined a savings organization in 1927, saving three yuan a month, with a total of 500 yuan. After 180 months, this year the principal is returned upon maturity. The amount of 500 yuan is correct, but its use is very difficult, as it cannot buy even one shi of rice. If it is a joke, then on average, saving 36 yuan a year, it takes a long period of 15 years to be able to buy eight dou of grain!

The difficulty of renting a house in Shanghai is like ascending to the sky. Everyone is putting up a front of "one more, two none, don't even ask" – meaning many people, no family, no guarantor – so they check themselves before moving. Recently, I saw rental advertisements in the newspaper using the words "rice area" as a selling point, meaning that the house is located in a rice-producing area, ensuring that there is no risk of running out of food. The idea is novel and very gratifying. Especially for families with large populations, it can indeed provide extra security.

Shops selling bread have long joined the ranks of the "squeeze." Between eight and nine in the morning, the number of people outside the shop is three or four times greater than the number of round family loaves of bread in the display window. Those who are quick-footed and lucky triumphantly return home with a "victory product" full of satisfaction. Those who arrive later have to endure hunger and clutch their tired and bony heads, thinking of other ways.

The sage said that food and sex are human nature, and the greatest desires of life lie in them. The biggest problem in life right now is how to solve the problem of hunger. If someone could invent a "hunger-relieving injection" in addition to the "birth control ring," it would definitely be welcomed, and it would not be limited by gender and would be even more effective.

In the silk and satin department of a large company on Nanjing Road, there was a piece of imported woolen men's robe material measuring one zhang and four chi, priced at 660 yuan. If it were made into a robe, the cost of the two sleeves alone would be more than 100 yuan. The ancients said "clean sleeves," but this saying seems to need to be reconsidered today.

### Sharing the Same Boat in Storms

— He Jia Zhi

(2) Sadness and Joy

Li Youxie ran a rice mill in the northern countryside. He said he needed to take care of things at the mill and would come back after a while. The eldest aunt said that she had children at home and was worried, so she had to go home to check on them. Mrs. Ye Er told Wei Cheng that his maternal uncle, eldest aunt, and second aunt had not slept all night. At the same time, she persuaded the second aunt to rest. Mrs. Ye Da was in the room with Cui Zhen and Wei Cheng. Wei Cheng stared at his mother with wide eyes. Cui Zhen was Mrs. Ye Da’s cousin, and she kept feeding Mrs. Ye Da with American ginseng soup, and also hung up Wei Cheng’s coat. She then called for Magpie to come into the room to accompany Wei Cheng. She went to Wei Cheng’s bedroom to find a pair of velvet shoes, asking Wei Cheng to change out of his mud-stained leather shoes.

Wei Cheng saw Cui Zhen wearing a blue cloth smock. The smock was not very clean, but her big eyes and fluffy, yellowish hair were her characteristics. Her every move was always like a member of the Ye family, forgetting her surname was Bian. Wei Cheng said, "Sister Cui Zhen, you haven't slept all night, you should rest too." Cui Zhen shook her head and said, "I didn't. I came at dawn. Brother Cheng, don't worry." When she reached the end, she had a slight sob in her voice and couldn't continue speaking. This was great news. Mrs. Ye Da suddenly called out "Wei Cheng." Wei Cheng hurriedly responded, "Mom, your son is back." He Ma, who was decocting medicine, and Mrs. Ye Er, who was counting money, all rushed in. Even the second aunt, who was dozing in the next room, heard Mrs. Ye Da call out clearly. Everyone said, "It's good, it's good. The medicine for the madman hasn't been taken, but just smelling the medicine, the illness has already taken a turn for the better." Cui Zhen thought that He Ma, who had been taking the medicine, had rushed in, and no one was taking care of the pot, so she secretly went to replace He Ma. (24)
