### The Kakov Southern Area: Germans Launch a Major Counteroffensive; Mop-up Operations Still Underway; Fierce Fighting Rages All Night in the Izium Region

Haitong News Agency, Berlin, German Leader's Headquarters, 29th – Today’s German military communiqué stated that the remaining enemy forces south of Kakov are still being mopped up. The number of prisoners and the quantity of war booty continue to increase daily. The German forces in the central sector of Eastern Europe are fighting bravely and have surrounded several large enemy battalions. German forces in the northern sector are advancing and have occupied several locations. Enemy isolated attacks have failed. Our aircraft bombed the Caucasian coast, hitting a Soviet destroyer. Warehouses and trains along Lake Ladoga were bombed by German aircraft. A cargo ship was hit and caught fire. In the port of Murmansk, a large merchant ship was hit and damaged. The aerial battle over Kerch yesterday resulted in the loss of twenty-two enemy aircraft.

Reuters, London, 29th – Moscow sources report that German forces in the Izium and Barvenkovo regions have launched a major counteroffensive against the Soviet forces attacking Kakov. Fierce fighting is still ongoing. According to unconfirmed reports received today from the Swedish capital, Soviet forces have surrounded and annihilated two Romanian infantry divisions in the Kakov region. One hundred Axis tanks were destroyed in the battle. Today’s Soviet communiqué stated that fierce fighting raged all night in the Izium and Barvenkovo regions, with no major events occurring on other fronts.

Haidisha News Agency, Berlin, 29th – The German High Command announced last night that the characteristic of the fighting south of Kakov on May 26th and the following night was the Soviet attempt to break through the German encirclement. The enemy numbered several thousand and desperately tried to break through to the east, but failed. Soviet reinforcements were also repelled by our forces. Fierce fighting lasted all day, and the enemy suffered heavy losses. German Stuka dive bombers continued to attack the surrounded Soviet forces south of Kakov the day before yesterday. Aerial battles occurred in the Donets region, with fifty-eight Soviet aircraft shot down by our forces.

Desperate Hand-to-Hand Combat in the Battle for the Izium North Bridge

Havas News Agency, Bucharest, Romanian Capital, 28th – Military observers here say that the situation in the Izium area southeast of Kakov on the Eastern Front remains extremely chaotic. German forces continue to attack key Red Army resistance centers without respite. General Bock, commander of the German forces in the southern sector, concentrated his main force in the northern part of the Izium area and broke through the Red Army’s lines on the night of the 26th, linking up with another German force. As a result, another Red Army unit was isolated. Two Red Army positions in the area have now been surrounded and are being constantly bombed by German aircraft. Last night, a Romanian unit arrived from the west at Marchubrovka, cutting off the final lines of communication between the two encirclements. Artillery and motorized units immediately joined the attack, causing heavy losses to the Red Army and taking countless prisoners. However, the Red Army still has considerable movement at the eastern end of the encirclement. After recapturing the Cossack Leffler Bridge north of Izium, the Red Army forced a crossing of the Donets River. The hand-to-hand combat in this battle was extremely fierce, with heavy losses on both sides. The Red Army finally concentrated one hundred anti-aircraft guns near the bridge to prevent German aircraft from bombing the retreating Red Army. At the same time, a large number of tanks and field artillery were concentrated in the Cossack Leffler area to cover the retreat of the troops. Last night, three Red Army divisions retreated across the bridge towards Kupyansk. However, the Red Army retreated while fighting, making the task extremely difficult. It is feared that the 100,000 Red Army soldiers still remaining in the encirclement will be unable to escape. Red Army engineers planned to quickly build another bridge across the Donets River to facilitate the retreat, but were prevented by German bombing. In short, the fighting in the Izium and Barvenkovo regions should end within two or three days, at which time the losses of soldiers and equipment on both sides can be announced.

Havas News Agency, Berlin, 28th – The German High Command issued a military communiqué, announcing a major German victory near the city of Kakov. All the newspapers here are using large headlines to report this. The Berliner Börsen-Zeitung reported, "The Red Army has been completely annihilated. This is the first time this spring, and it is expected that a major war will occur next summer. By then, this Red Army will hardly be able to participate in combat." The Berliner Lokalanzeiger also said, "If we want to understand the significance of the Red Army’s defeat, we should recognize Stalin’s expectations for this attack on Kakov." When General Timoshenko issued a military order on the 15th of this month, he also stated that the German-Soviet war had entered a new stage and strongly argued that the Red Army must begin a counteroffensive, recover all lost territory, and continue until the complete liberation of Soviet territory. It is not difficult to see how much importance he attached to this battle.

Haitong News Agency, Argentine Capital, 29th – At the Argentine Congress yesterday, Vice President Castillo’s message was read. It stated, among other things, that the unchanging goal of the Argentine government is to ensure that the interests of the nation can adapt to the needs of the international situation.

Argentina’s traditional principle of maintaining friendly relations with all countries in the world has been repeatedly affirmed. As for the state of siege declared in the country, it is a necessary measure to maintain domestic unity and prevent illegal propaganda. The reports of various ministers were then read. The Foreign Minister stated that Argentina maintains friendly relations with all countries on the one hand, and on the other hand, imports raw materials from foreign countries and strengthens national defense in accordance with the Pan-American collective policy. Negotiations on this matter are now proceeding smoothly.

### Tank Battles in the Western Desert Still Raging; Germany Remains Silent on War Situation

Havas News Agency, Berlin, 29th – The High Command announced that the German-Italian Allied Forces in North Africa launched an offensive on the 26th. The battle has not yet ended.

Havas News Agency, Rome, 29th – The High Command announced this morning that the German-Italian Allied Forces in North Africa launched an attack against the enemy on the afternoon of the 26th. By the morning of the 27th, a major battle had occurred, with the situation favorable to the Axis forces. We have captured a large number of prisoners and seized a large amount of military supplies. Our air force continues to assist the army in combat, shooting down seven enemy aircraft. Last night, several British aircraft dropped multiple bombs on Catalonia, causing minimal damage.

Haitong News Agency, Swedish Capital, 29th – The British Command in Cairo issued a military communiqué yesterday, stating that after the major tank battle in the Western Desert the day before yesterday, fierce fighting continued all day. The Axis forces were divided into two groups. The Axis forces northeast of Bir Hakeim have been cut off by British tank forces. Sources in London announced last night that the German armored column's attack on the British positions south of Bir Hakeim was a serious threat to the British flank.

Reuters, London, 29th – The major tank battle, which began on Wednesday morning in the no-man's land 50 miles south of Tobruk in Libya, was still raging last night. According to reliable sources in Cairo, there has been no unfavorable development in the war. The progress is as expected by the British authorities. Also, according to a Reuters special correspondent in Cairo, the location of the Axis tank column's major offensive and the initial situation of the engagement did not make Lieutenant General Ritchie, commander of the British Eighth Army, feel uneasy. This proves that the battle plan of German General Rommel was not unexpected. The German forces in Africa had only two routes to advance eastward. One was through a large minefield with a total of 10,000 mines, covering the front of the British outpost. The other was to bypass this area, but the British tank forces were waiting for the German forces to attack in the place they bypassed.

Reuters, Cairo, 29th – From the British point of view, military officials believe that the Libyan war situation is quite satisfactory, and General Ritchie is quite confident in the war. Judging from the phenomenon, the war is not proceeding as planned by German General Rommel.

Reuters, London, 29th – According to reports from London, fierce fighting continued in the western desert of North Africa yesterday. Two advancing Axis forces were repelled by the British armored forces. However, the war situation is still chaotic, and it may not be possible to obtain clear results in the next few days. Today's British Middle East communiqué stated, "On May 28th, fierce fighting continued all day. Of the two Axis forces moving northeast of Bir Hakeim, the one that advanced towards El Adem on the 27th did not reach its destination. Only its vanguard avoided engagement and made slight progress, reaching the areas of Tuda and Rejef, where it was repelled by the British armored forces. This Axis force then joined forces with other troops near Knightsbridge and was again intercepted by the British forces, resulting in a fierce battle. The Axis forces attacking from the south of El Adem have been defeated by the British forces. The British armored units attacked the Axis supply column just east of El Adem and were quite successful. The British Air Force continued to provide the greatest assistance to the ground forces, intercepting Axis aircraft and heavily damaging Axis military vehicles.

Haitong News Agency, Swedish Capital, 29th – According to news from Cairo, the German forces are attacking in three routes: two routes start from Bir Hakeim, and the third route advances along the coastal road from El Gazala. However, it is currently impossible to predict which route is the most dangerous.

Haitong News Agency, Swedish Capital, 29th – According to news from London, the British are extremely concerned about the German and Italian Allied Forces' offensive in Libya. Reports from various sources indicate that General Rommel obviously wants a quick victory, and the fighting is very intense. Journalists are speculating about the German strategy. According to a reporter from the "Daily Express," the German forces will attack Egypt via Tobruk after breaking through the British positions near Bir Hakeim. This news has not been confirmed. Other reporters believe that General Rommel's goal is to encircle the left flank of the British Eighth Army. According to unconfirmed reports from the British side, the German attack on Gazala from the south has been repelled. There is no official news about the tank battle near Bir Hakeim, but military officials strongly say that German tanks and artillery have an advantage.

Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 29th – German military officials remained reserved last night about the British reports on the war situation in North Africa.

### The Soviet Union Urges Again to Open a Second Front; America Asks the Soviet Union for Post-War Guarantees; British Labour Party Annual Conference Concludes

New York, 28th (Havas News Agency) - The New York Times' Washington correspondent reports that the Soviet Union has again urged the British and American governments to open a second front in Europe. The US government, in its response, reportedly requested direct access to information regarding the Soviet front-line situation.

Madrid, 29th (Haitong News Agency) - A New York correspondent of this newspaper reported that Washington has requested the Soviet government to provide formal guarantees regarding its attitude towards political and economic spheres after the war. Washington hopes that the Soviet Union will endorse the world order proposed by Roosevelt and Churchill in the Atlantic Charter. It is noted that the United States has already shipped \$1 billion worth of war materials to the Soviet Union last year, without receiving any compensation from the Soviet Union. Therefore, the United States is now requesting the Soviet Union to sign the Atlantic Charter.

London, 28th (Havas News Agency) - The British Labour Party Conference continued today, discussing the international situation and passing a resolution calling on workers across the country to vigorously manufacture ordnance for the Soviet Union and transport it to the Soviet Union as much as possible to support the Red Army. It also expressed hope that British troops would fight alongside the Red Army in Europe, and that the labor movement has a special responsibility for the future reorganization of the world. In addition, a motion was passed requesting the Executive Committee to urge the government to universally implement the spirit of the Atlantic Charter in Britain and its imperial territories.

Stockholm, 29th (Haitong News Agency)

### Mexico Establishes a State of War Against the Axis Powers; Measures Proposed by President Camacho Will Be Passed by the Parliament in a Short Period

Mexico City, 28th (Havas News Agency) - President Camacho delivered a speech to a special session of the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies today, requesting the two houses to agree to declare war on the Axis powers. It is reported that the country's oil tanker "Renos" and cargo ship "Olo" were successively torpedoed off the Atlantic coast, causing the relationship between Mexico and the Axis powers to become tense. Since the outbreak of the European war in 1939, Mexico has attached importance to maintaining the amity of the Pan-American countries and actively participated in American defense. At this juncture, the development of the international situation has compelled me to request the two houses to issue an order announcing that Mexico has, since the 22nd of this month, established a state of war with Germany, Italy, and Japan. From now on, Mexico must do everything possible to participate in the current war. Subsequently, the Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, Roaldan, delivered a response on behalf of the Chamber of Deputies, stating, "The Senate and the Chamber of Deputies are determined to do everything in their power to facilitate the government authorities in defending the nation's honor. I dare to assure the President that the two houses will promptly pass the measures proposed by the government, such as the privilege of declaring war on the Axis powers and temporarily suspending certain statutory procedures of the parliament during emergencies."

Buenos Aires, 28th (Allied News Agency) - Mexican envoys to various countries have been ordered to declare to the governments of their respective host countries that Mexico has become an ally of the Allied nations since President Camacho delivered his speech. As soon as the congressional vote is passed, the declaration of war will be announced, which is expected to be realized in a few days.

Political and Military Leaders Hold Meetings

Buenos Aires, 29th (Haitong News Agency) - According to news from Mexico City last night, the public's attitude towards Mexico's declaration of war on Germany, Italy, and Japan is very lukewarm. This fact is noteworthy because agitators have recently devoted all their efforts to promoting war enthusiasm in Mexico, but their effect is very limited. Furthermore, a military conference was convened in Mexico City today, attended by the commanders of the 34 military districts and the governors of the 28 provinces of Mexico. The Mexican Minister of Economy also plans to issue a "black list" similar to the one issued by Washington. According to confirmed news, former Mexican President Cardenas will be appointed as Minister of National Defense or the Supreme Commander of the Mexican Army.

Washington, 28th (Havas News Agency) - Regarding the Mexican President's announcement of being in a state of war with the Axis powers, although political circles here had anticipated it several days ago, they still consider this move to be very important, with significant political, economic, and military implications. As of today, there are already about nine American countries that have declared war on the Axis powers, including the Central American republics and the countries along the Caribbean Sea. There are also ten other American countries that have severed diplomatic relations with the Axis powers. Only Chile and Argentina have not changed their attitude towards the Axis powers. In fact, no South American country has yet declared war. It is noted that in 1917, the relationship between the United States and Mexico was not friendly. At that time, the US military occupied the Veracruz area, and General Pan's troops even went deep into Mexican territory, pursuing the "Villa" bandits. The German government also suggested that Mexico form an alliance with Germany, which is the famous Zimmermann Telegram, and promised Mexico that after the war, it would return the territory ceded to the United States (Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona) to Mexico. However, in recent years, thanks to Secretary of State Hull's Good Neighbor Policy, a friendly atmosphere has been created, enabling Mexico to decide to maintain allied relations with its neighboring countries. The result of the submarine warfare has also made a deep impression on the Mexican people, and the President has resolutely taken this decision.

### French Seaplane Crashes

Port de Bandol, Southern France, 28th (Havas News Agency) - A seaplane in this port accidentally crashed into the sea yesterday afternoon. All three pilots died, one of whom was a naval lieutenant. The cause of the accident is still under investigation.

### Special Compilation on Near Eastern Countries

2.  Outline of Turkey (3)

The second new type of educational construction in Turkey is school education. It was mentioned earlier that Turkey has implemented compulsory education, but compulsory education is now a thing of the past; because the education in major and minor schools has been on track, and the old and young, men and women, all have a considerable amount of knowledge, the word "compulsory" is no longer needed.

What is worth mentioning here is that the small Turkey already has nine glider training schools. Among these nine training schools, the one self-established by the current President Ismet Inonu is particularly outstanding. This school has 550 male students and 550 female students who are simultaneously receiving training in gliders and parachuting. One group graduates, and another group joins. Although the training lasts only three months, the results are excellent. After graduation, male and female students undergo extremely strict examinations. Those with the best results are sent to formal aviation schools to continue their studies.

The leading national university is, of course, Ankara University. This university is completely Westernized and includes departments of agriculture, music, education, architecture, etc. Except for the architecture department, the rest are co-educational. Having such amazing achievements in just sixteen years is truly worthy of admiration.

Regarding the new construction of social undertakings, one feels overwhelmed with beauty at first glance. They have various newly established commemorative festivals, such as the Anniversary of the Establishment of Parliament, Children's Day, Women's Day, etc. What I admire is not just the names and patterns of the commemorations, but the spirit of holding the commemorations! On the other hand, the most active in social undertakings are the male and female youth associations. The Turkish youth associations are Turkishized and are definitely not a superficial imitation of what others say.

The new construction movement in transportation can be said to be completely successful. All railways invested by Germany, Britain, and France before and after the last European war, totaling more than 2,000 miles, have long been nationalized. Since the political reform, another two or three thousand miles of lines have been added. All building materials for these lines are produced in Turkey, and even the application of locomotives is domestically produced. With another thousand or so miles of addition, the Turkish railway network can be said to be completed.

The rural areas of Turkey can almost be said to have been completely modernized; the methods and farming, irrigation, and harvesting have all adopted the latest machinery. In addition, a model farm is set up near the Turkish capital, which is the central hub for guiding rural areas throughout the country. The duties of this hub are not only to guide all farming operations, but rural hygiene is also an important subject.

In short, everything in Turkey today is new; what is particularly important is that a new spirit like a lively dragon and a vigorous tiger is emerging throughout the country. The new Turkey is indeed worthy of our admiration. But, isn't Turkey the sick man who has always been ridiculed? How did it revive to such an extent in just ten or twenty years? This is a miracle!

We believe that Turkey's rise from a precarious situation to the ranks of the world's strong nations after several turnarounds is a miracle. Indeed, but we can say that this miracle is man-made, and that man is General Ghazi Mustafa Kemal Pasha, the Turkish national hero admired by both the great powers and the small. Each word in the name of Turkey has a meaning: the first word Ghazi is translated as "destroying all immorality;" the second word is the name of the nation; the third word Kemal means "perfection," which was given to him by one of Kemal's teachers who praised him for his proficiency in mathematics; and the fourth word means "general." It is said that Kemal changed his name seven times, and his final name was Ataturk Kemal, where Ataturk means "father of the nation."

Here I don't want to introduce his biography, but only briefly mention a few of his achievements in rebuilding Turkey. In his childhood, he only reluctantly studied some school courses. He dropped out of school once at the age of twelve or thirteen, and later entered the military preparatory school. After graduation, he entered the military academy and graduated at the age of twenty. He then entered the military university.

In his third year of university, because of his excellent academic performance, he was selected to the General Staff Headquarters for training. At the same time, he secretly organized a revolutionary secret society, which was the starting point of Kemal's glorious career. It went through one arrest and one exile. With the spirit of continuous efforts, he merged the revolutionary organization he created with the "Young Turk Movement" organization, and finally succeeded in a bloodless revolution in 1908. This success laid a small cornerstone for the future Turkey.

At this time, Kemal did not enjoy honor and glory because of his hard work, because his goal was to rebuild a brand-new Turkey. During the first Balkan storm, he was ordered to defend the Dardanelles Strait. In this fierce battle, although he was unfortunately hit by an enemy bullet and injured in one eye, he established an important military achievement, showing his promising talent.

When the First World War broke out, Kemal advocated that Turkey strictly maintain neutrality; unfortunately, the power fell into the hands of others, and he was only a soldier. How could he turn the tide of this disaster? In the second year of the war, the Anglo-French joint fleet attacked the Dardanelles Strait, but was unsuccessful. They then ordered the army to attack the Gallipoli Peninsula, wanting to cut off the retreat of the Dardanelles, but they encountered Kemal head-on, and the Allied forces suffered a great defeat. After this battle, the fame of the young General Kemal spread not only throughout Turkey, but also immediately imprinted his name on the world's military and political stage.

Unfortunately, Turkey participated in the war, and unfortunately, it joined the wrong group - this was something that Kemal had foreseen with foresight but could not save. He had no choice but to beg the Allied powers for peace and surrender in the autumn of 1918. What was left was only a rugged and arduous road, how could the patriotic sons with a passion for the future of their country move forward? But Kemal never lost heart. At the same time, we must also consider that Kemal at this time had not only tasted the bitterness of foreign invasion, but was also suffering from heartbreaking internal troubles - the jealousy of the general purulent politicians. As a result, he was demoted to a remote border town in Asia Minor to garrison.

### The Dredging Bureau Intensifies Work to Prevent Flooding; Insufficient Vessels in the Past Caused Flooding; Dredging Will Be Intensified in the Future to Prevent Flooding

The Shanghai Times reported that the Chief Engineer of the Dredging Bureau, Mr. Liu, met with reporters yesterday (the 28th) and said that the Dredging Bureau is currently using a number of its own and rented vessels to dredge the Huangpu River to prevent flooding in late spring and early summer. This work is considered necessary, especially at this time of year. However, the number of vessels currently available to the Dredging Bureau is insufficient to cope with the difficult task of dredging the Huangpu River, and one of the bureau's largest dredgers has been leased to the Japanese naval authorities, making it even more difficult to carry out routine work.

Dredging Difficulties Lead to Water Accumulation

Before the war, the Dredging Bureau was busy dredging non-stop. The Huangpu River is located at the mouth of the Yangtze River, so selective dredging is of no avail. The silt in the Huangpu River accumulates extremely quickly. For example, after the silt in the Yangshupu district is cleared, the Roosevelt Wharf area needs to be dredged again. Therefore, dredgers must work continuously to be effective. In the autumn of 1937, a large dredger was leased to the Japanese naval authorities, and the normal work of the Dredging Bureau was suspended. This vessel was subsequently returned, but all auxiliary vessels were in urgent need of repair, so the Dredging Bureau was unable to work on the same scale as before. As a result, the city has been plagued by water accumulation in recent years.

Shortage of Vessels Insufficient for Work

The dredging work of the Huangpu River was restored in 1938 and has been carried out intermittently since then, but the riverbed has accumulated thick mud, which is almost beyond the capacity of the Dredging Bureau. Therefore, the large dredger "Hong Kong" was borrowed from the Hong Kong Dockyard in the Netherlands to make up for the shortfall. This vessel is now active in the Huangpu River. Shanghai has repeatedly reported flooding in recent years, which should not be blamed on the Dredging Bureau, as its vessels are insufficient and unable to work adequately. Water accumulation in Shanghai may be due to the accumulation of silt at the bottom of the river. If the Huangpu River is not dredged, the plan of the Public Works Department to spend huge sums of money to raise low-lying roads to prevent flooding will also be ineffective.

Intensify Dredging to Prevent Flooding

Therefore, the Dredging Bureau has now adopted realistic methods, dredging the Huangpu River as usual to the greatest extent possible to prevent flooding in the coming weeks. The main dredgers engaged in dredging are the borrowed "Hong Kong" and the self-owned "Hailong" (transliteration). There is also a team of small dredgers assisting in the work. The Dredging Bureau has attempted to obtain vessels from other ports to speed up the dredging process, but all have failed, so the bureau is currently undertaking all the work with an incomplete dredging fleet.

### The New Agency of the Public Works Department That Solves All Problems (9): The Future of the People of Shanghai Will Be Decided in Their Hands

In the first few days of the great upheaval in December, the entire city was plunged into a whirlpool of tension and chaos. The supply of food for the people, which had never been interrupted, urgently needed to be strictly controlled in terms of its distribution methods. The main objective of the Public Works Department was to supply everyone with what they needed and to prevent the accumulation of goods by those with surplus resources. These people purchased large quantities of inventory, which drove up prices in order to reap a large profit later on.

Prohibition of Transportation

The main method by which the Public Works Department suppressed hoarding was to prohibit the transportation of rice without a special permit. This is still the case today. All rice beyond the retail quantity that each person can purchase at one time is strictly prohibited from being transported; the importance of this is too obvious.

The main method by which the Public Works Department distributes rice is through retail rice shops. In addition, two bureau-run rice sales locations were established in mid-October; another was added in mid-December. This was to guard against the possibility that retail rice shops might break their contracts or go back on their word. In other words, in any unforeseen emergency, the people would always have a place to obtain some food.

These rice sales locations are working well. Because the Public Works Department reduced the amount sold to a maximum of one "sheng" per person per purchase (translator's note: it has now been relaxed to one and a half "sheng"), the number of customers they serve each day is between 40,000 and 50,000... "That's certainly a large number," Mr. Littlepage said with a smile. "They sell rice according to exactly the same methods as the retail rice shops, and they are still working as usual."

Retail Rice Shops

"Those people you see lined up outside the Rice Grain Office," Mr. Littlepage continued, "are retailers who come every Monday, Wednesday, Friday, and Saturday to wait for rice to be allocated. They buy an agreed-upon number of bags of rice from the bureau with cash, and then sell it at the retail price and quantity limited by the Public Works Department."

The police are monitoring the retail sales in each rice shop. The police are responsible for paying attention to whether there is over-selling, over-purchasing, or exceeding the price limit. The police receive a report on the total quantity of rice in each retail rice shop every day. They know that each bag of rice contains 125 "sheng," so they infer that if a rice shop receives 40 bags of rice, it should supply 5,000 people.

"That's where the rice-buying lines come from," Mr. Littlepage returned to the original topic, "those are all ordinary people waiting outside the shops to buy their share of food."

Every time rice is allocated to a retail rice shop, it is constantly inspected from the time it leaves the warehouse until it arrives at the shop. (To be continued)

### The Ever-Changing Means of Transportation: New Electric Cars Will Soon Be on the Road; Successfully Developed After Many Experiments; Beautiful in Style and Extremely Economical in Electricity Consumption

Since the outbreak of the Pacific War, the source of gasoline in this city has been cut off, cars on the road have almost disappeared, and transportation has been extremely inconvenient. At present, various types of bicycles, charcoal vehicles, and gas vehicles are being used as substitutes for walking. Zhang Zhongchun, the son of Zhang Xunxun, a wealthy merchant from Ningbo residing in Shanghai, once studied at the Far East Aviation School in Hong Kong and has a good understanding of mechanics and electromagnetism. In view of this, Mr. Zhang has invented a new type of electric car after a long period of research and numerous experiments. Once the painting is completed, it will soon be seen on the streets. This car only has three wheels, two in the front and one in the back. The entire body is less than eight feet long and only four feet wide at its widest point. It can accommodate up to five people. The structure and coordination of its parts are small and precise, and the interior is uniquely designed. In addition to being equipped with wireless radio, lightning clocks, and lightning meters similar to those in cars, it also has a lightning fan. The exterior style is beautiful and generous, and driving is extremely easy and labor-saving. Starting and reversing do not require reliance on external force, because its power is derived from the current of the storage battery, hence the name "Leidong Che" (Lightning Car). The value of the electricity consumed daily is less than five yuan in legal tender. Moreover, all charging procedures only require inserting a specially made lightning plug inside the car into an ordinary electrical outlet when entering the garage in the evening every three days, and taking it out the next morning. This is only done every three days. According to Mr. Zhang, he is currently applying for a patent from the authorities. If there are no other obstacles, he will set up a factory for mass production or set up stations along the way to issue cards. If this can be realized, it will greatly contribute to the transportation industry in this city.

### Public Works Department Revises Retail Price Limit for Beer

The Public Works Department announced: It is noted that the matter concerning the retail price limit for beer was announced by this Bureau in Announcement No. 5898 on May 16 of this year. Now, due to the recent depreciation of the old legal tender, this Bureau has decided to cancel the said announcement in order to adjust the price limit for beer. From today, sales will be made according to the following maximum prices: (A) For retail sales by shops, five yuan and thirty cents in new legal tender per "tao er" bottle, and three yuan and sixty cents in new legal tender per pint bottle. When retail shops sell full bottles of beer, they must only sell to users who return the same number of empty bottles. (B) For sales by hotels, restaurants, dance halls, and bars, Category A (places with music and/or dance performances): nine yuan and thirty cents in new legal tender per "tao er" bottle, and six yuan and twenty cents in new legal tender per pint bottle. Category B (restaurants and bars without entertainment): eight yuan and ten cents in new legal tender per "tao er" bottle, and five yuan, thirty cents, and five cents in new legal tender per pint bottle. If buyers wish to pay in old legal tender, they may choose to do so, but they must pay a discount according to the official exchange rate.

### Shanghai Epidemic Hospital Sees Increased Outpatient Visits

The Shanghai Epidemic Hospital on Yuchiaqing Road has seen a gradual increase in patients in recent days. It is reported that the number of outpatients each day is over 180, and the number of people requesting hospitalization is also around a dozen each day, which is significantly more than half a month ago. However, the epidemic department of the hospital has not yet been opened.

### Pastor Yu Enshi Appointed Bishop of Jiangsu Diocese

The Episcopal Church of China's House of Bishops has scheduled to ordain Pastor Yu Enshi of St. Peter's Church in Shanghai as the bishop of the Jiangsu Diocese of the church at 2:30 PM on May 31 at the Church of the Savior on Zhao Bishop Road in this city. The ordination ceremony will be presided over by Zheng Hefu, the chief bishop of the House of Bishops and the current bishop of the Henan Diocese. The newly appointed bishop is a native of Yin County, Zhejiang Province. He once taught at Soochow University and studied in Europe and America, specializing in sociology and theology. After returning to China, he was sent to Yunnan by the Hong Kong and Guangdong Diocese of the church in 1921 to lay the foundation for the Yunnan Church. In 1926, he was hired by the National Association of the Chinese YMCA to serve as the traveling secretary of the Chinese Student Volunteer Evangelistic Corps. Later, he was hired by the Henan Diocese of the Episcopal Church of China to serve as the pastor of the Kaifeng and Zhengzhou pastoral districts and concurrently as the principal of Kaifeng St. Andrew's Middle School. After staying in Henan for four years, he became ill from overwork and resigned to come to Shanghai for recuperation. He was then hired as a professor by both Great China University and Guanghua University. Before long, he was again hired by the Public Works Department's Yucai Public School as the Chinese principal. At the same time, he was hired by St. Peter's Church in Shanghai to serve as the voluntary district pastor of the church, which has lasted for more than ten years, the longest term of service for any district pastor in the church's history. In March of this year, he was also hired by the National Bible Society as the general secretary. Now that he has been elected as a bishop to preside over the Jiangsu Diocese of the Episcopal Church of China, setting a precedent for Chinese people to manage the church, it is indeed a blessing for the future of Christianity in China.

### Pan's Wedding Gifts Donated to Xin Puyu Hall

Mr. Pan Huibin was married on the 12th of this month. The legal tender amount of 2,418 yuan received in wedding gifts from relatives and friends has now been entirely donated to the Xin Puyu Hall as expenses. His enthusiasm for doing good deeds is truly admirable. Xin Puyu Hall accommodates more than a thousand elderly, weak, orphaned, and helpless children, and its funding is extremely strained. It is deeply hoped that donations will be made continuously from all walks of life.

### Gospel for Novel Lovers

The Ren Ke Book Service Society, located at No. 63, Lane 194, Gordon Road (North of Avenue Road), has collected a large number of famous novels from the north and south, totaling thousands of types. The editions are all new and clean, and the fees are even more affordable. During the period of soliciting basic readers, there is still a 50% discount. At a time when prices are soaring for everything, it can be said to be an excellent opportunity to read novels. Therefore, people from all walks of life have heard the news and are rushing to subscribe. The society has brochures available, which will be sent by mail upon request with postage.

### A Short Talk (2)

— Old Zhang

"Yes, yes, all other professions are inferior, only studying is noble. Haha!" Peng Jugong said, shaking his head in agreement while drinking.

Casually dismissing me, the four of them began to talk attentively. "Class M, you're really making a fortune! Yesterday, a batch of zero-six and Wuli Long made you 50,000 overnight. Hahaha..." Peng Jugong said.

"All thanks to your great efforts, all thanks to your great efforts! If it weren't for your help, brother, how could I get a share of the pie?"

"Not to brag, but my skills are really good. That plague-ridden hoarding merchant initially held onto the price, so I simply ignored him. Later, I managed to kill the price." Peng Jugong continued.

"Yes, yes, all thanks to you. But to be honest, yesterday I also relied entirely on Zulao's help, because when your phone call came asking for money, my position really couldn't be turned around. Fortunately, Zulao was nearby..."

"No need, no need? Just a casual word from you, brother!"

"We're all one of the family, no need to be polite. Hey, Lao Peng, I think saccharin still has potential these days, what do you think?" Class Huang asked.

"There's definitely potential, as long as you can get it in, I dare say 'guaranteed son'," the pharmaceutical factory representative said, patting his chest.

"Saccharin is indeed a hot commodity. Recently, it hasn't moved much. If we guess right, it's definitely no less than quinine. These days, let's simply collect a few thousand cans separately. Let's decide to do it that way." M agreed with their opinions.

"Okay, okay, okay!" Huang, Peng, and Wu echoed in unison.

I quietly sat on the side, unable to interrupt. Fortunately, I drank a few more glasses of wine, which gave me a bit more courage. Taking advantage of the opportunity when their conversation temporarily came to a pause, I haltingly said what I had wanted to say for a long time:

"M, life is really difficult now."

"Yes, ah, it's really one day at a time."

"Your business is doing very well, right?" It was my clumsy wording.

"Where, where? Aren't we just making a living? A rising tide lifts all boats, what good can be said?"

"I also want to ask you to help me do some business."

"Joke, joke, Mr. Zhang is too polite. Teachers are the purest, how can they do such mercenary things? Hahaha!" Peng Jugong's triumphant laughter.

"M, I want to give you a sum of money and ask you to casually do something with it." I said.

"Why, why bother. We're all one of the family, I'll definitely take care of you when I have the opportunity. To be honest, if you give me money, I certainly can't spare that much energy and time, and I can't bear the risk. The money you worked so hard to earn, it's not worth it..."

"That's right, that's right! Your hard-earned money, Mr., it's not worth taking the risk?" Class Huang lit a cigarette and narrowed his eyes into a line. Then he turned to Peng Jugong again:

"Then Lao Peng, you go out and search for saccharin separately this afternoon. If you don't have enough orders, call me."

"Ha... Lao Peng has the goods, Zulao Huang has the money, why fear the task won't be accomplished?" M said, patting Lao Peng's back.

"However, putting it all together, it all depends on you, brother." Class Huang added.

When I got home, my wife told me that two students had come to see me, asking if there was something wrong because I had taken leave today. Later, she told them that I had something to do, and they left.

I fell sadly onto the bed. (The End)

### Lactotopin Selling Well

The Lactotopin produced by Yangyuan Pharmaceutical Factory has miraculous effects and the properties of a king's medicine. It has long been respected by Chinese and Western medical circles and people from all walks of life. Since the source of milk powder in this city has been cut off, lactating women who lack milk are vying to take it. It is generally recognized to be effective for both mother and child, economical and convenient to use, and as a result, the supply is often unable to meet the demand.

### Chinese-Western Football Match: Chinese United Defeats Northern Western Children by a Large Margin; Strong China Beats Hequn White 7-0

The Chinese-Western football match, Chinese United versus Northern Western Children, was held at the Racecourse yesterday afternoon, with an unprecedented grand scene. At 3:00 PM, the prelude was Strong China versus Hequn White. Strong China, with the help of Fan Jinyong and Feng Shoupeng, was like a tiger with wings. Hequn White, after all, had many new players, and Xiao Ziwen was unable to support the building alone. Strong China was able to do as it pleased. Ruan Longsheng of Strong China opened the scoring, followed by Gao Baozheng's contribution. Ruan scored twice. In the first half, Strong China led 3-0. After changing sides, Hequn White's counterattack was ineffective. Chen Yuanji, Zhao Yongfang, and Gao Baozheng of Strong China each scored three consecutive goals. Finally, Chen Yuanji made another meritorious contribution. Strong China won 7-0 against Hequn White. At 5:30, Chinese United and Northern Western Children took the field. Northern Western Children kicked off. Han Longhai got the ball and passed it to Adai. Adai dribbled to the enemy's goal and lightly lobbed it over. In a panic, the two inside backs kicked the ball into their own net, giving away a point. This happened only one minute after the start of the match. The stalemate lasted until the 25th minute, when Yuan Kuntian passed to Adai, who lifted the ball. Cao Qinfang scored from the 15-yard mark. At the 30th minute, Cao scored again. At the 37th minute, Yuan Kuntian got a pass from Dai and swept the ball into the net. Four minutes later, Yuan scored a second goal. Adai also broke through the net. The first half ended with Chinese United leading 6-0. After changing sides, Northern Western Children had bad luck and failed to score despite repeated attacks. In the 17th minute, Chinese United got a corner kick. Yuan opened it perfectly, and Adai shot into the net from the 25-yard mark. Northern Western Children was at a loss. One minute before the end of the match, Cao Qinfang headed the ball into the net. Chinese United won with

### Tianjin Gang Comes Out; Gold Price Unsupported

Yesterday, the spot gold market was gloomy. After rising, it suddenly fell again. The price flew out of 37,000 yuan, and then retreated to the 35,000 yuan mark. Although there was a certain rumor on June 1st, the large-scale sales of the Tianjin gang made it difficult for the price to be supported for a long time. People from all sides were uneasy. Since the morning, each tael (10 taels) has continued the rising trend of the previous day, already reaching 37,000 yuan, 2,150 yuan higher than the opening price of the previous day. A certain gold store bought in, and continued to rise to 37,500 yuan. A securities firm sold on behalf of the Tianjin gang, and banks and the financial community also sold, pushing the market price down 2,600 yuan step by step. At 11:10, it was reduced to 34,900 yuan. After a certain gold store sold a small amount, it suddenly came back to buy in, and a certain gang also absorbed it, immediately raising it to 35,600 yuan. The financial community continued to sell. The midday closing was 35,100 yuan, 250 yuan higher than the previous day's clearing price, with a difference of 2,600 yuan. After the closing, a certain gang bought in at 35,300 yuan, and then there were sellers at 35,200 yuan. Trading was quite brisk.

The outward price of jewelry gold per tael from major new firms first rose to 3,600 yuan, then to 3,500 yuan, an increase of 200 yuan (a decrease of 400 yuan for purchases). Silver bullion was listed at 28 yuan, the black market was 24.5 yuan, and silver coins were stable at 14 yuan each.

### Gold Pounds Alone Are Popular

Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw British and American gold pounds rise by 40 yuan each, the former to 760 yuan and the latter to 780 yuan. US dollar notes continued to retreat to 40 yuan, and Hong Kong notes also decreased slightly to 5.5 yuan. Military notes opened in the morning at 12.4 yuan, retreated to 11.85 yuan, and then rose to 12 yuan. The final price was 11.85 yuan. The spot price was still around 11 yuan.

Yesterday, the discount rate of the Money Trade Association remained at 15%. The discount rate for drawn checks first increased to 120 yuan per thousand yuan, then gradually decreased to 80 yuan. At noon, it rose to 120 yuan again. In the afternoon, it decreased to 90 yuan, and some people were willing to discount in, the same as the previous day. The price difference between new and old legal tender was 2.3 yuan per yuan, retreated to 2.18 yuan, then 2.2 yuan, and in the afternoon, it was slightly lower at 2.15 yuan, a small decrease. Spot cash was also slightly lower at 2 yuan and 2.08 yuan.

### Two Banks' Negotiable Instruments: Clearing House Acts as Regular Exchange Agent; Five More Banks Added

After review and approval by the Negotiable Instruments Clearing House Committee of the Association, it was decided that the Association would begin acting as an agent for the exchange of negotiable instruments for Jianhua Bank and Zhongya Bank on June 1, 1931 (next Monday), and Jianhua Bank was assigned number 51-4 and Zhongya Bank number 51-5 in the clearing house.

### Four Banks Join the Association

The Shanghai Banking Industry Association yesterday sent a letter to various member banks stating that the National Trust Commercial Savings Bank, China Fisheries, Dasin, and Nanyang Commercial Banks had applied to join the Association as members. The matter was submitted to the Review Representative Meeting on May 20. After verification, it was found that it conformed to the principles of membership resolved by the Members' General Meeting in January of this year. A report was drafted and sent to the Association. Accordingly, it should be approved in accordance with the regulations. All of the above banks will join this Association as members from June of this year.

### Intense Competition for Public Bonds; Unified D fell Dramatically Alone

The unofficial market for public bonds yesterday saw the highest trading volume ever recorded in the unofficial market. The market price initially rose, but then returned to fatigue. However, although the selling pressure was heavy, the strength of the buyers was also strong, enough to be evenly matched. The large number of sellers was concentrated in one family, and the large number of buyers was also concentrated in one or two families. Therefore, most of the goods sold by Tongli were absorbed by Tongkang and Lianyi, almost like water returning to a stream. The prosperity of the trading and the tension of the situation were rarely seen in the public bond market. Among the other sellers, Hu Heji also sold quite a bit. Jiu Feng, Xinhua, Tongyuan, Shunli, and other families also sold about 1 million in total. There were even more who followed the trend to sell. Among the buyers, in addition to Tongkang and Lianyi having the most, Tongyuan, Yuanhe, Xinji, Yitai, and Hongda also absorbed 135 million each. With such a large number of physical goods flowing out, the buyers were not seen to be intimidated, which shows their strength. As a result, the prices of various bonds rose and fell differently. Jia, Ding, and Wu fell by four corners to 2.2 yuan, while B rose by one corner, and Bing was flat. The difference between Jia and Bing was only 1.5 yuan. The transaction volume was about 6.6 million yuan. A brief table is listed below:

### Flourishing Chinese Stocks

### Bottom of June Has Arrived; Cotton Yarn Declines; Factory Orders Even Weaker

The cotton yarn market situation turned weak, due to the end of June and the fact that the funds released by the financial industry have already been recalled. As a result, those with tight positions have dumped their goods, causing the market to trend downward. 42 counts Blue Phoenix 17,600 yuan to 8,100 yuan, 42 counts Yanghe 17,200 yuan to 7,000 yuan, 60 counts New Sunlight 32,500 yuan, 42 counts Shuiyue 17,000 yuan, 32 counts Xiantao 16,500 yuan to 3,500 yuan, 40 counts Jincheng 15,500 yuan, 20 counts Blue Phoenix 9,600 yuan to 10,000 yuan, 20 counts Yueqin 9,100 yuan, 20 counts Double Globe 9,250 yuan to 9,000 yuan, 20 counts Double Horse 9,100 yuan to 8,890 yuan, 20 counts Shuiyue 9,300 yuan, 16 counts Fengnian 8,600 yuan, 20 counts Hongxi 8,900 yuan, 10 counts Boy Scouts 7,100 yuan, 10 counts Double Globe 6,800 yuan, 10 counts Deli 6,650 yuan, 10 counts Baoyi 6,900 yuan, 10 counts Fuyan 7,100 yuan, 20 counts Double Horse factory orders initially opened at 9,000 yuan, then rose to 9,400 yuan, and then, after hearing that the spot price was weak, gradually loosened to 8,800 yuan at closing. Outside the market, it was even weaker at 8,730 yuan.

### Continuous Exodus of Cotton Cloth

Market Prices Gradually Declining

Factory Cloth: Yesterday, as the end of the month approached in the cloth market, credit was particularly tight. Many short-term speculators continued to exit, causing market prices to steadily weaken. 16-pound "Globe" coarse cloth fell to 370 yuan, "Flying Goose" to 365 yuan, 12-pound "Globe" fine cloth to 335 yuan, "Fortune" to 330 yuan, 9-pound "New Character" coarse cloth to 200 yuan, 8-pound "Zhen Zhong" to 195 yuan. "Peach Blossom Lady" silk bottomed out at 491 yuan, closing at 494 yuan, down 6 yuan. "Longevity" silk crepe fell to 11 yuan 7 jiao 5 fen, also down 2 jiao 5 fen.

East Cloth: 12-pound "Dragon Head" fine cloth opened at 410 yuan in the morning, rising to 411 yuan. The noon close was 494 yuan, and the afternoon opening was 496 yuan. Trading was unusually quiet, with few transactions. The evening close was 494 yuan, the same as the noon close, down 11 yuan per bolt from the previous day. "Four Gentlemen" serge red orders reached a high of 14 yuan 4 jiao 5 fen in the morning, then bottomed out at around 13 yuan 5 jiao. The evening close was 13 yuan 6 jiao, also down 6 jiao.

### Uniform Decline in Various Grains

Due to sluggish sales in the bean market yesterday, some speculators loosened their grip, leading to a weakening trend. Prices generally declined slightly. The following transactions were recorded: 30 packages of Tianjin "Golden Yuan" beans, priced at 340 yuan; 20 packages of Sangyuan yellow beans, priced at 312 yuan; 150 packages of Yangzhou mountain yellow beans, priced at 315 yuan; 140 packages of Chongming red sand beans, priced at 168 to 170 yuan; 40 packages of Tianjin red beans, priced at 170 yuan, sold independently.

Corn trading was quite slow yesterday, with a calm and soft sentiment. The market lacked vibrancy. The following transaction was recorded: One cart of Wuhu corn, priced at 189 yuan delivered.

Soybean cake sales remained sluggish. The market showed weakness initially, followed by firmness, with prices varying. The following transactions were recorded: 1,000 pieces of Fengji soybean cake, new warehouse orders for May 15th, priced at 83 to 84 yuan; 1,000 pieces of Lizi cake, new warehouse orders for May, priced at 85 to 87 yuan; 1,500 pieces of Shenji cake, old warehouse orders for May, priced at 72 to 70 yuan 5 jiao; 1,000 pieces of old warehouse orders for June, priced at 70 to 75 yuan; 500 pieces of old warehouse orders for September, priced at 71 yuan; 500 pieces of new warehouse orders for February, priced at 85 yuan 5 jiao.

Wheat bran trading remained quiet yesterday, but sellers intended to maintain prices, raising them by two or three yuan. The following transaction was recorded: 100 small packages of Sanxin wheat bran, priced at 141 yuan.

### Local Nails and Baise Markedly Increased, Especially Severe

The local factory's nail market, although not particularly lively in recent days, maintained a strong sentiment among industry participants due to continuous business at the warehouses. It was also affected by the severe fluctuations in the financial market and the high value of military certificates relative to the legal tender, resulting in an invisible price increase of 10 to 30 percent across all goods. This was especially pronounced for local nails, as the number of these goods circulating in the market has noticeably decreased. Therefore, the increase in Baise was particularly severe, reaching 1,100 yuan per barrel yesterday, a rise of 100 yuan compared to the previous market price. Compared to the previously agreed price of 650 yuan, the increase is significant. Other items included 1,000-pound black iron ingots, sold for 16,000 to 17,000 yuan per ton; 200-pound American Society iron, 1,000 yuan per box; 90-pound and 100-pound American single-layer tinplate, 1,300 yuan per box; 200-pound and 180-pound variable transport boards, 2,600 yuan.

### Galangal Resurgence

Galangal prices had previously softened due to a larger supply, with prices falling repeatedly, totaling over 200 yuan. Recently, due to volatile financial changes and the correlation of this commodity with military certificates, costs have increased, and the market price has rebounded by 100 yuan yesterday, with a tightening trend.

Entertainment World

### On the Emerging Comic Actor Sun Shengwu

— Plum Blossom Pavilion Master

Currently, there is an extraordinary abundance of comic acting talent. Besides the veteran actor Xiao Changhua, there are also individuals like Ma Fulu, Ru Fuhui, Cao Ergeng, Jia Duocai, Zhu Binxian, Sun Shengwu, Ai Shiju, Xiao Shoushan, Wang Fushan, and others, all of whom are outstanding choices of their time. However, I am most impressed by Sun Shengwu. Although Shengwu's education is limited (a graduate of Fu Society), he possesses exceptional intelligence and talent, unlike ordinary people. His acting has a touch of subtle humor, and he excels particularly in playing civilian comic roles. For example, Jiang Gan in "The Gathering of Heroes," Tang Qin in "The Trial of the Head and Assassination of Tang," Jia Gui in "The Dharma Temple," Chong Gongdao in "Escorting a Prisoner," Zhang Biegou in "The Bone Pot Case," Zhang Wenyuan in "Live Capture," the teacher in "The Lotus Lantern," the shepherd boy in "The Little Shepherd," and the Taoist priest in "Green Stone Mountain," all performed in the style of Xiao Changhua, with rules and regulations, neither bland nor fiery. His ad-libs and improvisations are wonderfully natural, completely different from the vulgar and clumsy performances of ordinary actors. Occasionally, he cross-dresses as the matchmaker Liu in "Picking Up the Jade Bracelet" and Sai Xishi in "Thirteen Sisters," also creating humorous and amusing effects, full of joy. Mr. Sun Luan, a famous amateur comic actor in Shanghai, praised him as "the only one after Changhua," and I agree. In the autumn of the 28th year of the Republic (1939), I represented a certain theater in Ping to select actors, and among the comic actors, I chose Shengwu. After arriving in Shanghai, he unexpectedly became famous and well-reputed. Theatergoers did not criticize him for being a newcomer, which shows that those with true artistry do not need to worry about not being appreciated. As Changli (Han Yu) said, "There are steeds of a thousand li only after there are Bole (talent scouts). Steeds of a thousand li are common, but Bole are not." In this regard, Shengwu's fame, although relying on his unique skills to win acclaim, would not have been possible had he not encountered me, as he would have been buried among ordinary talents. Sun Shengwu might still be unknown today. Therefore, I know that whether an actor becomes famous or not indeed depends on an incredible opportunity. Success and advancement are not something that can be forced by human effort.

### Review of "Sand's Happiness and Suffering"

— Stone Man

The Cantonese dialect play "Sand's Happiness and Suffering," performed by the South Guangdong Troupe at the Lyceum Theatre, is a pioneering effort. Attracted by a sense of novelty, I went to appreciate it.

"Sand's Happiness and Suffering" is a five-act play. The story, based on real events in Guangdong, is a realistic drama with a family education theme. Because the play only depicts real events, it is full of straightforward narration, and the entire play is wrapped in a plain and simple interest.

The actors are quite accomplished in their art. Liu Xiaoqian, who plays Tan Yaren's wife, Yin Jie, acts out the shyness of a poor scholar when she has an affair with the wealthy Sha Anbo, half-pushing and half-yielding, in a very natural way. Liang Sujuan, who plays Mrs. Sha, is a chubby woman who is constantly wiping tears and sweat, vividly portraying the foolish character of an old lady in the play who spoils her son and lets him do evil, thinking that this is the way to love her son. Especially in the final scene, when her son Anbo is sentenced to death for having an affair with Yin Jie and murdering Tan Yaren, the tragic expression of mother and son parting is the most brilliant, moving many ladies in the audience to tears. The male protagonist is a thoroughly typical rich playboy, and Hu Zhangzhao plays the role incisively. Cui Junxia's poor scholar is full of sourness, while Cui Ququ's retainer is sneaky and sinister. Fang Zailie's Sha's father is stern, righteous, and not servile, which can be called one of the two best aspects of the play. The pageboy Ya Fu is also uniquely styled with his humorous and amusing performance. However, the act of stuffing his trousers in the fourth act seems a bit excessive and should not be imitated.

Director Cui Junxia handled several climaxes quite successfully. In addition, the set design, lighting, and makeup are also not bad. In short, the future of this new type of Cantonese troupe has been laid on a solid foundation during this public performance, filled with boundless hope and light. As long as each actor is willing to work hard, then those who will rival Mandarin spoken drama on the theater stage tomorrow will be none other than you!

### New Voice Troupe to Perform at Lafayette in Mid-June

— Bo Shui

The news that Yang Naimei is forming a troupe has been circulating for a long time. Now, the organization has finally materialized and has been officially announced. The troupe's name is tentatively set as "New Voice." What can be told to the readers is that Yang Naimei's purpose in forming the troupe is not her personal heroism, or what is commonly called "showing off," but rather to participate in the theater scene and fulfill a bit of responsibility. This is definitely not an empty slogan, and the future will prove it. The first play is "Wang Xifeng," including "Making a Scene in Ningguo Mansion," "Poisoning a Love Trap," and "Selections from A Dream of Red Mansions." The performance date is approximately in mid-June. The venue has been agreed upon with the Lafayette Theater, and both parties have signed a six-month contract.

### "China Troupe" to Perform "Peking Man"

The news of "Sun Jinglu and Zhang Yijun" has been reported in this newspaper. It is now confirmed that the official premiere will be held on June 3rd at the Carlton Theater, named "China Troupe." The first play is Cao Yu's "Peking Man." The director's position is held by Jiang Tuo, the director of "Homecoming" from the former China Travel Troupe. It is rumored that Gu Zhongyi's "Luan Fenfei" (The Separated Phoenixes) is postponed to the third play due to the time required for revision. Following "Peking Man" is Zhou Yibai's "Dawn Wind, 残月". Mr. Zhou has been busy writing film scripts for several years, and aside from "King of the North" and "Li Xiangjun," he has rarely had the time to write stage plays. This time, he is writing "Dawn Wind, 残月" for the China Troupe because of the troupe's urging, and he is currently working day and night to complete it soon. (The picture is of Sun Jinglu).

### Sharing the Same Boat Through Storms

— He Jiazhi

(5) Give and Take

Guoqi pulled Weicheng's hand over, held it tightly, and said: "Who doesn't know you are in mourning? This is not the issue. But you need to understand that some of my classmates now know that I have a sister, a sister who can speak well and is also pretty good-looking. They are all fawning over me, some even saying they are willing to be matchmakers for Guofang, and some are even recommending themselves! There are more people like this this year than last year. If you say you want Guofang to be a member of the Ye family, then I can directly and straightforwardly reject those matchmakers and self-recommenders. I can also take some time to tell my sister what Weicheng's intentions are. And what you tell me now only needs to say one word, 'yes,' or say two words, 'no.' Saying 'yes' today, and then realizing it next year or the year after, is not too late; saying 'yes' today is a reservation; realizing it next year or the year after is fulfilling the reservation."

Weicheng laughed and said: "Guoqi, isn't it better not to talk about it now? In fact, it's not permissible for me to talk about it now. We have plenty of days to talk about it in the future." Guoqi got off Weicheng's bed, went back to the bed he was supposed to sleep in, and lay down, saying: "No need to talk about it, that's fine." Weicheng was a little surprised by their actions and said: "Guoqi, are you angry?" Guoqi replied from the pillow: "Angry? What am I angry about?" Weicheng also got out of bed and sat on the edge of Guoqi's bed, laughing and saying: "Please forgive me. I am unspeakably grateful for you and your sister's presence and assistance during my late mother's mourning. The people in the village have shallow vision and are prone to being surprised. Many people are guessing, saying that this beautiful girl is the future daughter-in-law of the Ye family. I want to set an example for the villagers, and I don't want the villagers to guess correctly. Moreover, the matter you are talking about is a major matter. It is not appropriate to agree just because I agree. Forgive me for not mentioning the parents' orders and the matchmaker's words. If I do, I'll be criticized for feudal thinking; but at the very least, I need to get my aunt's consent, and Guofang needs to get my father's consent. This intention, of course, will take a considerable amount of time. You can't keep forcing me to say 'yes' or 'no.' (189)
