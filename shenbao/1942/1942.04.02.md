Free French Forces in the Pacific Under Macworth's Command

London, 1st (Reuters) – The Free French Forces in the Pacific have been placed under the command of General Macworth. General Troguer has notified Macworth of this.

Saigon, 1st (Haitong) – A dispatch from Melbourne today states that General Macworth has encountered various difficulties since taking office as the Supreme Commander of Australia. For example, Macworth has no authority to command the Allied Navy, so he has been unable to control it. The Australian Air Force remains an independent unit and does not obey Macworth's orders. Macworth's authority over the Army has also not been clearly defined, so it is uncertain whether Macworth can revoke orders issued to the Australian Army by the Allied government. General Macworth is discussing these issues with Australian officers.

### Japanese Aircraft Attack Bataan Peninsula

Washington, 31st (Reuters) – The US Army Department announced today that on the Bataan Peninsula in the Philippines, there has been no land combat in the past 24 hours, except for contact with outposts.

### MacDonald Discusses Strengthening of Canadian Army This Year

London, 30th (Reuters) – British High Commissioner to Canada, MacDonald, stated in a speech here today that the Canadian Army will be greatly strengthened this year and is expected to become the vanguard of the offensive in Europe. Canada's ship production this year will be equal to that of Britain.

### Pacific War Council is a Consultative Body; Closely Cooperates with London War Council; Roosevelt Issues Statement to Reporters

Washington, 31st (Reuters) – Roosevelt stated at a press conference that the Pacific War Council recently convened its first meeting here. Its main task is consultation and discussion. When reporters asked whether the representatives participating in the meeting had equal powers, Roosevelt replied that the issue was not about the equality of powers, as the meeting was a consultative body. The President pointed out that the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the London Pacific War Council, and the newly established Pacific War Council in Washington will maintain the closest cooperation. When reporters asked whether Australia and New Zealand hoped to send representatives to the Munitions Assignments Board, Roosevelt replied in the negative. The governments of Australia and New Zealand had previously requested to send representatives to participate. The President pointed out that the work of munitions allocation is currently being carried out by the Munitions Assignments Board in accordance with the policies determined by the Pacific War Councils in Washington and London, and the Joint Chiefs of Staff, with all countries maintaining a faithful attitude. When reporters asked why India was not included in the Pacific War Council, the President said that India was not in the Pacific. When reporters asked whether, under such circumstances, a separate war council for India and the Far East would be established, the President said he did not know. He went on to point out that although a small part of the southwestern corner of China, the Chinese troops under the command of General Stilwell, has been included in the Indian theater, China is in fact considered to be located within the Pacific theater. When reporters asked about the issue of Macworth's command authority over the Navy raised by the Australian press, Roosevelt replied that within the Southwest Pacific area, Macworth is the supreme commander of the air, land, and sea forces. The President denied the reports in some newspapers that the London Pacific War Council would decide on policies while the Washington War Council would discuss strategies. The President stated that this rumor was inaccurate and that both meetings are consultative in nature, i.e., Washington and London consult with each other, and both meetings also consult with each other.

Stockholm, 1st (Haitong) – Yesterday, five small boats suddenly sailed from the sea to a small town on the Norfolk coast of England. The boats were full of fully armed soldiers. When the coast guard asked where they came from, they ignored them. The shore then opened fire with machine guns on the approaching boats, but the soldiers on the boats had already landed. The soldiers all spoke a foreign language. The defense forces then resisted with rifles, machine guns, and hand grenades. It was later revealed that this was an invasion exercise, and such exercises have begun to be held throughout the UK to provide the public and the coast guard with more common sense in dealing with such situations.

### UK Holds Invasion Exercises; Women Organize Guerrilla Units

The commander-in-chief is a member of parliament, named Sykeskill Adens. The mission of the women's guerrilla units is to protect their families with weapons and resist foreign aggression, so that they will not be caught off guard in the event of an attack.

London, 1st (Havas) – The authorities announced today that the secondary zone searchlight teams in the UK will be staffed by women's auxiliary forces.

### US Criticizes Argentina for Lack of Contribution to Defense; President Arnulfo Arias of Panama Delivers Speech, Will Reorganize Military to Defend Country

Washington, 31st (Havas) – It is widely rumored that the United States and Argentina have increasingly divergent views on the issue of Western Hemisphere defense. A senior State Department official recently issued a statement explaining the current US policy, stating that if Argentina does not assume part of its responsibility for defending the Western Hemisphere, the United States must give preferential treatment to those American countries that have declared war on or severed relations with the Axis powers. This is an inevitable issue. After this decision, we can guarantee the future security of the nine countries along the Caribbean Sea that have declared war, other Central American countries that have declared war, and the nine countries that have severed relations with the Axis powers. Argentina must recognize that the United States should give priority to supplying military supplies to the belligerent countries, and this policy should not be considered a retaliatory measure against that country, but the fact remains that Argentina is not currently contributing to the defense and security of the Western Hemisphere. As for Chile, which is more vulnerable to attack, it should be treated separately.

Panama City, 31st (Havas) – Panamanian President Arnulfo Arias gave a broadcast address to the nation today, stating that since 1920, our country has not had a single soldier, but is prepared to reorganize its military when necessary to defend the country. We must prepare to sacrifice to preserve democracy. We will thoroughly cooperate with the United States in the future, and may soon need soldiers and tanks to accomplish this task.

### Linton Warns Americans to Prepare for Air Raids

Cleveland, Ohio, USA, 1st (Havas) – Air Defense Commissioner Linton warned people today to prepare for air raids, stating that no one can guarantee that we will not be bombed like Coventry and Plymouth in England. Our country is only a few thousand miles away from German bases in Norway. It does not take more time for German aircraft to fly from Iceland to New York than it does to fly from that island to the Great Lakes region. The Iceland base is in our hands, it is true, but modern warfare progresses rapidly. We must not rely solely on the Maginot Line-style strategy, lest we be surrounded by the Germans from the north.

### King Boris of Bulgaria Returns from Germany

Stockholm, 31st (Havas) – King Boris of Bulgaria, who had gone to Germany to inquire, has completed his affairs and departed from Berlin today to return home. Before leaving, he visited General Göring, the German Minister of Aviation. King Boris has extensive connections in Germany, so he met with various German dignitaries while in Berlin. The Bulgarian Embassy hosted a dinner to welcome the King, and the German Ambassador to Turkey, von Papen, was also invited to attend. It is said that he had a long conversation with the King. According to a correspondent for the Geneva Daily News in Berlin, the Bulgarian issue seems to have been resolved. The German authorities do not want to add anything to the recent speech by Bulgarian Prime Minister Filov. It is rumored that Bulgaria has agreed to mobilize 250,000 troops to go to the Eastern Front, but how the Bulgarian army will go to the front and in what way is still unknown. Ambassador von Papen stated in Berlin that Turkey is currently doing its best to stay out of the war, and this attitude is fully in line with the German viewpoint. In addition, according to unconfirmed rumors, Germany has provided Bulgaria with a promise, stating that if Bulgaria enters the war, Germany will guarantee the integrity of the country's current borders. If this statement is true, it further proves Germany's unusual concern for maintaining peace in Turkey and Bulgaria. A spokesperson for the German Foreign Ministry has repeatedly stated that Germany has no intention of expanding the current war.

### US-Finland Relations to Deteriorate

Stockholm, 1st (Haitong) – Washington dispatches, diplomatic sources in Washington stated yesterday that relations between the United States and Finland will deteriorate further in the near future.

Although US Secretary of State Hull announced at the beginning of US involvement in the war that US-Finland relations would remain unchanged, relations between the two countries are now in a state of tension. Conversely, some circles in the United States support maintaining an understanding with Finland.

### Australian Government Bans Import of Alcoholic Beverages

Melbourne, 31st (Havas) – The Australian Commonwealth Government today ordered a ban on the import of whiskey, brandy, and other alcoholic beverages from countries in the sterling area.

In order to remedy this, the government decided to increase the quantity of coffee purchased from non-sterling area countries. It is expected that the volume of coffee imports this year can be restored to the level of the 1938-39 fiscal year.

The Führer awarded him the Iron Cross Knight's Oak Leaves in recognition of his achievements. He was born on March 2, 1911, and joined the Navy on April 1, 1935. At the beginning of the war, he was a submarine lookout, and in 1940 he was promoted to submarine commander. On his first expedition, he sank 106,000 tons of enemy ships, including the British auxiliary cruiser HMS "Galicia" (22,300 tons) and HMS "Dunvegan Castle" (15,000 tons).

### France Hopes to Complete Unification During Wartime; Interior Minister Pucheu Delivers Speech, Believes a New World Can Be Produced

Vichy, 31st (Havas) – Interior Minister Pucheu recently gave an interview to a reporter from "Modern Magazine," stating that while we are prepared to cooperate sincerely in the establishment of a new Europe, maintaining our country's independence and integrity is a necessary condition. European solidarity cannot be mere rhetoric. If the people of our continent want to avoid grief and disaster, unification must be completed after the war, preferably during the war, because only free nations can face a new future together in glory and dignity. As for our national revolution, it will definitely constitute a new system and will not be limited to certain reforms. A country with a long history like ours will inevitably make mistakes, but it will eventually gain the necessary strength from its traditional spirit and its territory and people to create a new situation that meets its needs. Our country's unification is related to Europe's unification, so people should believe that in this world of raging flames, a new world will be produced.

### All India Congress Committee Firmly Opposes British Proposals; London Believes Negotiations Have Not Ended, Will Discuss Temporary Compromise

New Delhi, 1st (Reuters) – After three days of discussion, the All India Congress Committee firmly opposed three specific points in the British proposals. One is the British refusal to transfer defense management rights, which the committee considers to be the most important shortcoming. The second is the plan explained by Cripps, which the committee does not agree with because it allows multiple dominions to emerge in India, thereby destroying the Congress Party's long-cherished desire for Indian unity. The third is allowing representatives of the various states to serve as a definite part in drafting the Indian constitution, and then not being concerned about it afterwards. The Standing Committee resumed discussions with Cripps for three hours today without reaching a final conclusion. The committee is scheduled to meet again this afternoon.

New Delhi, 1st (Reuters) – The British government's proposals regarding the Indian issue encountered difficulties yesterday after the Standing Committee of the Indian National Congress discussed them for three and a half hours. The committee's opposition to the last clause of the proposal, namely the issue of defense command, remains unyielding. Therefore, if this clause is not amended, there is a risk that the entire proposal will be rejected. The committee notified British envoy Cripps of this situation yesterday afternoon. After the committee adjourned, National Congress Chairman Acharya declared that regardless of the committee's final decision, I dare to take full responsibility to announce that the committee is in complete agreement on the proposals put forward by Cripps. The committee has discussed all aspects of this proposal at length and is prepared to draft a reply. It is understood that Gandhi and Nehru have now joined the drafting work, and the content is scheduled to be finalized by the committee this morning before being announced. Cripps may announce the success or failure of this trip tomorrow morning. As for the Standing Committee of the Muslim League, discussions continued until last night without any agreement being reached. It is scheduled to move to Allahabad this Friday to continue the discussions. President Jinnah and other committee members are scheduled to depart from here to Karachi on Thursday.

London, 1st (Reuters) – Although the All India Congress Committee did not accept the British proposals, Indian figures in London still believe that the negotiations have not ended and that a temporary compromise may be reached at the last second to avoid a complete breakdown in the negotiations. Indian figures also believe that the Congress Party originally supported dividing the British plan into two parts: one to resolve India's political status after the war, and the other to formulate wartime measures and immediately transfer various powers, including defense, to the Indian people. The Congress Party's policy remains unchanged, namely: 1. Complete independence for India; 2. Transfer of real power, including defense, to the Indian people; 3. Full guarantees to protect the rights of minorities.

### Various Sikh Parties Issue Statement Stating Reasons for Non-Acceptance of Proposals

New Delhi, 1st (Reuters) – The Committee of Various Sikh Parties stated in a statement today that Cripps' proposals are unacceptable for the following reasons: 1. The specific conditions of the proposals do not protect and strengthen India's integrity, but rather divide the provinces and the constitution; 2. The goals of the Sikh community have been betrayed, which is regrettable. The statement also stated that "the status of the Sikh community in Punjab has finally been eliminated."

New Delhi, 1st (Reuters) – National Party leaders Sapru and Chalaoga issued a joint statement urging the negotiation of a satisfactory solution to the defense issue in order to ensure the success of Cripps' mission.

Tokyo, 1st (Domei) – The acting spokesman of the Japanese Cabinet Information Bureau declared to foreign reporters today that if the Indian people cannot wisely handle their own problems and avoid being deceived by the United States again, then Indian freedom will definitely be lost forever. The proposals put forward by Cripps are nothing new.

### Ceylon

Since the Japanese army occupied the Andaman Islands, the waves in the Indian Ocean have gradually become turbulent. Ceylon, the southernmost island of India, suffered its first air raid on the 30th of last month. Ceylon is world-famous for its tea production, and tea-growing areas are spread all over the island. Its capital, Colombo, is a scenic spot and one of the best harbors in the world. The scenery is lush, the strange flowers are fragrant, and new-style buildings are everywhere. (See picture above.) On the southwest coast of Ceylon is Galle, the oldest tea port, where Chinese, Sirabians, Persians, and Abyssinians all traded until 1862 and was still a major commercial port. (Picture below) is the ancient fortress of Galle, built in 1669.

### Continued Trial of the Case of Misleading the Country: Debates on the Shortage of Armaments and the Insufficiency of Mechanized Units to Resist the German Army; Daladier and Others Refute the Allegations

Havas News Agency, Lyon, France, 31st [of the Month]—The High Court in Lyon convened this afternoon to continue questioning several witnesses in the case of misleading the country. Nearly all witnesses testified that all French mechanized units were insufficient to resist the German offensive in May and June of 1940. However, the accused, former Prime Minister and Minister of War, Daladier, expressed disagreement and refuted the allegations. Former Commander-in-Chief of the National Defense Forces, Gamelin, unexpectedly broke his silence and interjected in the debate. The two sides engaged in a heated argument, each sticking to their own claims. The details are as follows:

Lack of Tanks Was the Main Cause of Defeat

General Martin, former instructor at the Saint-Cyr Military Academy, spoke first, stating that until 1939, the French General Staff always considered tanks to be auxiliary weapons. Therefore, there was no coordination between tanks, artillery, and the air force. They also believed that tank units could not operate independently of the infantry. In essence, the main reason for France's defeat was that the German army had an absolute advantage in tanks, and it was not primarily due to German air superiority. The accused, Daladier, then stood up to ask, "Does the general know the number of tanks that France possessed on September 1, 1939, and May 10, 1940?" Martin replied, "Only 1,835 vehicles." Daladier then stated, "According to this figure, it already exceeds the 1,600 vehicles stipulated in the mobilization plan. Moreover, I dare say that we actually had 2,700 tanks in September 1939, and 3,500 tanks in May 1940. As for the German 'Blitzkrieg' armored divisions, half of them were only ordinary armored vehicles. General Doumenc and others in our country had advocated for the organization of armored divisions as early as 1928, but most members of the Army General Staff opposed it. Later, the Polish campaign provided a lesson, but French generals remained stuck in their old ways and opposed all new facilities."

Lack of Cherishment for War Equipment

General Keller, former Director of Tank Training, stated, "As of September 1939, the German army had 5,000 tanks, and by May 10, 1940, it had increased to 7,000 or 7,500 tanks. Even if we assume that 1,000 tanks were lost in the Polish campaigns, the number of German tanks fighting on the French front should still be between 6,500. In contrast, on September 1, 1939, we only had 1,302 modern tanks, 723 patrol tanks, and another 600 to 700 old-fashioned tanks. As for the rumors that soldiers abandoned war equipment, it is absolutely not true. To my knowledge, not only did the soldiers cherish war equipment, but even the workers in the munitions factories in Paris organized sabotage teams to automatically destroy tanks that were still under construction to prevent them from falling into the hands of the enemy. However, the French army lacked military wireless radios, motorized bicycles, anti-tank guns, and various transportation tools. Moreover, emergency medical supplies for the wounded were also lacking. At the time, the French government blindly hoped to achieve something diplomatically, which was absurd. If we had started to intensify national defense production as early as 1938 instead of waiting until 1939, our military equipment might have been on par with Germany, which is hard to say." At this point, Daladier interjected again and asked, "Is General Keller also aware that the General Staff had canceled tank manufacturing orders in 1938 and omitted the orders of 1936?" Keller replied that this was because there were no funds to allocate, so they were forced to do so. The two then repeatedly debated the intelligence reports on the number of German tanks for a long time. Daladier insisted that the difference in tank strength between France and Germany was not as great as Keller imagined and read a report written by General Keller in July 1940. The report expressed regret that the French General Staff had failed to adopt new tactics. Daladier believed that this report showed that the military department was still following outdated theories regarding the use of tanks.

Gamelin Expressed Indignation

When General Keller mentioned that he had reported the insufficient number of tanks to his superiors, the accused, former Commander-in-Chief of the National Defense Forces, General Gamelin, suddenly shouted, "You never did such a thing!" The voice was like thunder, and the audience was shocked. Finally, General Keller stated that one French armored division had been ordered to go to Belgium, and another division had been ordered to go to Sedan. In short, Commander-in-Chief Gamelin and his General Staff personnel knew very well the situation of our country's tanks.

### Travelogue of the Indian Peninsula (8): Tiger Hunting in Hyderabad

I stayed in Hyderabad for two weeks, and my job was to record on film how the prince had used his wealth to improve the lives of the people with the improvements he had made over the past thirty years. The Osmania University here is named after the prince and was founded by him in 1918. The Osmania Hospital is the best hospital in South India; it has a currency bureau where Hyderabad's coins and stamps are printed.

However, the most developed aspect of Hyderabad, and what the prince particularly wanted to develop, was agriculture and small rural industries. This is in stark contrast to the city of Mysore in the south, which focuses on hydroelectric power and heavy industry.

Mr. and Mrs. Hadali invited us to go hunting 125 miles northeast of the city. This was the most luxurious hunting experience we have ever had. Our tent could be considered a small town, and the canopy could accommodate a circus troupe. It was set up in a clearing in the forest, and twenty palace guards served the five of us. We drove in the most comfortable cars to hunt, and 1,500 hunters drove the beasts for us. We each caught a tiger.

In a village 30 miles away, we saw a baby contest.

An Indian female doctor, wearing a beautiful gray-green gown, instructed the mothers on how to bathe their children, and she personally bathed 24 babies. After the healthiest child was selected, Mr. Baji awarded the prize to the child's mother.

The female doctor told me how to prevent tuberculosis from running rampant and invited Mr. Baji to visit her women's hospital, where she served as a doctor, surgeon, and nurse. There were no electric lights or running water in the operating room, and I don't know how she performed her work.

After we returned to Hyderabad, we told the prince about the brave female doctor's struggle in the villages north of the city. He promised to provide assistance.

What a remarkable old man Prince Akbar is! He is over seventy years old and has made great contributions to India. He is responsible for countless public works projects within the state of Hyderabad. England can bestow any honorary award, but he still lives in peace and comfort, humble and courteous. A year ago, Sir Akbar enjoyed boxing, but the doctor told him that this sport was too strenuous and that it was not suitable for his age.

We gradually traveled south to Madurai, where the climate was hot and humid. It was almost the end of March, and the monsoons were about to arrive. On the seas of South India, it is not very cool even in the cold weather. Only after the showers brought by the monsoons can the sultry climate improve somewhat.

The Great Temple of Madurai is one of the greatest temples in India. The Nayak dynasty ruled Madurai in the 17th century and built this temple. Great towers are built in the winding courtyards, and the walls are painted with Indian mythology for miles.

During this pilgrimage to the Indian Peninsula, we made a special trip to the island of Ceylon for only a week because the monsoons were about to arrive. Our purpose was to use film to tell the world about the life and resources in this equatorial paradise. Although the time was short, we learned about the production of tea, coconuts, cinnamon, and other things, as well as the general conditions of the islanders.

We followed the coast of Colombo, then turned inland, trekked through the mountains to Kandy, and finally returned to Talamani through the heart of the island. Many people have been to Kandy, a city with a temple containing a Buddha tooth, built in the fourteenth century, which is very famous in Buddhist history.

100 miles north of Kandy is the city of Anandapura, and few people visit this desolate city except for antiquarians and monks. It is said that before the twentieth century, this seemingly barren city was very lively, with a population of millions, and the city area was about the size of London today!

The streets of Anandapura are long, and the ruins are buried in the jungle, but the excavated relics show the greatness of Ceylon's culture equivalent to the time of Jesus. I don't know how it has mysteriously declined to the present.

After returning to Madurai from Ceylon, we began another long march, climbing over a high mountain path of 7,400 feet to reach Mysore. Like in Hyderabad, we had already made an appointment with the prime minister of this place, Sir Ismail, and all preparations had been made to photograph the development of important industries in this progressive city. We visited this great dam, less than two miles long, and the reservoir is 50 square miles in size. This can irrigate hundreds of square miles of originally arid fields, and provide hydroelectric power to some factories.

Mysore City is constantly improving, and industries such as silk weaving, chemical industry, sandalwood oil, steelmaking and gold mines are gradually rising. The Kolar Gold Fields near Bangalore is India's most important mineral source. The mines have been in operation for thousands of years and are the most important source of gold in the world. To this day, the gold mine has reached a depth of 8,000 feet, which is deeper than the African gold mines.

It was very interesting to visit the entire site. The weather was very hot, and I saw workers returning from the bottom of the mine to the surface, still wearing thick leather coats.

We met Sir White Hata, whose palace was decorated with electric lights on the outside. Sir Hata liked to be quiet and spent most of his time in contemplation and prayer, but he made great contributions to the people. Sir Hata died of heart disease in August of the year before last. India lost a progressive prince, and the world lost a great man.

We were very happy that in the year we arrived in the state of Mysore, a small village north of Mysore City was holding a religious celebration every fifteen years. There is a mountain in the village, which is made of smooth boulder. From the foot of the mountain to the top, there are 500 stone steps, all of which are carved out of the mountain stone. At the top of the mountain stands a statue of a god, 70 feet high, said to be the Jain leader. This great stone statue is carved from a single stone, exposed to wind and rain, and has been for thousands of years. A faint smile still hangs on the lips of the stone statue. A platform was built around the stone statue, because thousands of believers were coming here to perform an oil pouring ceremony for the statue. Pious believers ran up the mountain day and night, applying milk, honey, fruit, flowers, sugar, and sandalwood oil on the feet of the statue. Everyone came barefoot, and so did we. As long as we walked the entire length of the 500 stone steps, we would inevitably be barefoot.

We traveled north all the way, crossed the Western Ghats, and finally arrived in Mumbai on April 12, 1940, before letting our expedition vehicles rest. In ancient times, goods were transported from India to Central Asia, Assyria, Persia, and the Roman Empire. The long journey began in Mumbai, and we ended our long trek here.

Since Da Gama rounded the Cape of Good Hope to reach Calicut in 1498, Europe discovered a way to India, but few people have faithfully followed this route for transporting silk and spices, crossing the vast East to reach the Indian Peninsula. After completing a great pilgrimage, we found ourselves back in the most historically significant overseas transportation location in the world. (End)

### Village Near Mysore

There is a stone statue on the mountain that is thousands of years old. Villagers and believers come here every fifteen years to hold religious celebrations. From the foot of the mountain to the top, there are 500 stone statues, all of which are carved out of the mountain stone.

### Sublease Licenses Began to Be Issued Yesterday; Three Types of Licenses Issued: List of Licensees and Ceramic Plates, All Must Be Filled Out Truthfully and Hung in a Conspicuous Place Inside the House

The sublease licenses issued by the Public Works Department began to be issued yesterday, with an attached sublease form and a ceramic number plate. The above license form and ceramic plate must be hung in a conspicuous place inside the house. The instructions on the plate have various regulations as follows: "This form must be filled out and hung in a conspicuous place inside the house. This paper should be replaced when the situation changes." The following details are listed: (A) Under the heading "Name of Resident," it is divided into: 2. Landlord's name, 3. Tenant's name. (B) Under the heading "Location of Residence," it is divided into: 2. Landlord's location of residence, 3. Tenant's location of residence. (C) Under the heading "Rental Value of Each Location," it is divided into: 2. Landlord's location of residence, rental value; 3. Tenant's location of residence, rental value. On the left side, there is another column that should specify the landlord's monthly expenses, divided into: Rent paid to the landlord, property tax, license fee, water fee, and electricity fee. The significance of filling out and hanging this sublease list lies in comparing the sublease income with the monthly expenses to see if it exceeds 20% of the expected profit.

Instructions for Indicating the Name of the Location of the House

The back page of the above sublease list is printed with the name of the house in Chinese and English, so that it can be classified and written. It is divided into: (A) Downstairs: entire downstairs, front parlor, back parlor. (B) Second floor: entire floor, front room, back room, attic on the second floor. (C) Third floor: entire floor, front room, back room, attic on the third floor. The landlord must truthfully fill in each item on the above list, and must not neglect it, otherwise they will be punished.

License Valid for Three Months

As for the sublease license, it is printed in both Chinese and English. In addition to writing the name and address of the licensee (including the name of the street, neighborhood, and house number) and the previously announced sublease rules, there are also the following instructions: 1. This license is valid for three months, until June 30, 1942. 2. This license is not applicable to hotels. No one may illegally sublease a house. Even if the sublease violates the contract already signed by the licensee, holding a license does not exempt them from legal liability.

### Implementation of Epidemic Prevention Inoculations in the French Concession

The Epidemic Prevention Committee of the French Concession, according to the scheduled procedures, held cholera vaccinations. The first phase was carried out in the area where cholera was most rampant, and vaccinations were repeated three months later. This method is based on the results of the census and has now begun to be implemented, ending on April 15. From March 16 to 21, 1942, vaccinations were carried out in Section 194, where seven people contracted cholera in 1941. Currently, there are 4,120 residents, and 3,014 people have been vaccinated. From March 23 to 28, vaccinations were carried out in the Baxianqiao Section, where ten people contracted cholera in 1941. Currently, there are 35,035 residents, and 26,946 people have been vaccinated. Section 147 was vaccinated on March 30, where four people contracted cholera in 1941. Currently, there are 6,472 residents, and 4,923 people have been vaccinated. In total, 34,883 people have been vaccinated. The second phase will begin on April 15 with group vaccinations, starting with schools. There are approximately 100,000 students in primary and secondary schools in the French Concession. After that, vaccinations will be carried out by section, and cholera prevention vaccination stations will be set up at the entrances of major roads and alleys to complete the epidemic prevention work.

### Talk by the Japanese Naval Landing Force Authorities on Methods of Preventing Terror and Staying Vigilant

(Dispatch from the Tongmeng News Agency in Shanghai) Terrorist incidents in this city have gradually decreased due to the citizens' organization of self-defense groups and the implementation of the baojia system, which helps the police authorities to strictly prevent them. The Japanese Naval Landing Force authorities have issued a statement hoping that citizens will provide even closer assistance in order to eliminate terrorist incidents in this city. The authorities stated that terrorist activities have decreased recently, especially after the organization of self-defense groups and the establishment of the baojia system. Due to the cooperation of the general public, their actions have been dealt a heavy blow, and local security has gradually improved. In order to prevent trouble before it happens, the police authorities hope that all citizens will have a deep understanding and provide even closer cooperation to the police authorities. The following is an explanation of their vigilant methods:

In the past, terrorists used many methods. From the end of last year to the beginning of this year, the main methods were sniping with pistols or throwing hand grenades. However, the recent implementation of vigilance exercises has been very successful. There is no doubt that they will be immediately arrested when taking this method. Therefore, it seems that they have recently specialized in using time bombs, because when the bomb explodes, the terrorists have already taken the opportunity to escape, and there are very few opportunities for on-the-spot arrests.

There are various types of so-called time bombs. The following are two examples to illustrate one aspect: one is made of gunpowder, batteries, and a watch. When the hour hand reaches the preset position, the current is connected and the gunpowder explodes. The other is a combination of gunpowder and other heat-generating chemicals, which uses the heat of the chemical reaction to ignite the gunpowder. These bombs are all placed in wooden boxes, but they are usually placed in leather suitcases to avoid public attention. It is very simple to place them near the target. How to prevent this kind of bomb? First, it must be discovered during transportation, which is implemented by the crackdown authorities. Second, it must be discovered when it is placed at the target location, which the general public and self-defense groups should pay full attention to. Thirdly, the location where it is pre-set should be discovered, which can be done by anyone. If a suspicious package is found in a certain place, attention should be immediately paid to nearby pedestrians to prevent them from approaching, and the nearby police authorities or crackdown agency should be notified.

The following points should be especially noted: 1. In places where many people gather (such as entertainment venues, cinemas, restaurants, etc.), objects brought by guests should be kept on their behalf. If the person entrusting the object is suspicious, the authorities should be notified immediately. 2. Operators of these places where many people gather should clean and strictly check for any such objects before customers or tourists enter the venue. After customers or tourists enter the venue, inspectors should be sent to patrol the venue. 3. When participating in various gatherings or watching movies, you should check under the seat before sitting down and always be vigilant. 4. General households should always check around the house, under the floor, and in the trash. If such objects are found, the nearby residents or pedestrians should be immediately warned, and they should be discarded in a square where no one passes. If there is no suitable place, then let them be placed in their original place and warn pedestrians not to approach. Also, if you see exposed wires and smell gunpowder, you should pull them out to prevent an explosion. However, do not rush to move them to a place where pedestrians gather. It is hoped that citizens will pay attention. If an accident occurs due to negligence, responsibility cannot be avoided.

### Consolidation of Four Film Companies Completed; Capital Set at Three Million Yuan; Establishment on the 15th

Negotiations for the merger of the Guolian, Yihua, Guocui, and Sanying Film Production Companies with the Zhongye Film Production Company to form a joint film production company have been ongoing for some time. Substantially, it has been settled. Zhonghua Company will invest 1.55 million yuan, while Guolian, Yihua, and Guohua companies will invest 1.45 million yuan, totaling a capital of 3 million yuan. Personnel arrangements have also been finalized, with Zhang Shankun appointed as General Manager, Yan Chuntang as Deputy General Manager, and Yan Youxiang as Assistant Manager. Underneath, there will be four production directors, with Xu Xinfu, Shen Tianyin, Zhang Shichuan, and Yan Youxiang tentatively selected for the roles. Below the production directors, an editorial and directing committee and a publicity department will be established. The main photography studio is designated as Dingxiang Garden. The existing directors and stars from each studio will also be consolidated. It is hoped that current operations will not undergo significant changes. Films that have not yet been completed will be finished before the 10th of this month to conclude the old setup. Other film companies without photography studios or a core group of actors will naturally be eliminated.

### Indian Bose Currently Residing in Japan

According to the English-language "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury", Lieutenant Matsuda, assistant spokesman for the Japanese Army, denied yesterday (the 31st) the Reuters report of March 29th that Indian Bose had died in a plane crash near Japan. It is claimed that Bose, the former president of the Indian National Congress, currently resides in Germany or at least somewhere in Europe. However, another well-known patriotic Indian also named Bose currently resides in Japan and gave a radio address to the Indian people on Monday night. The rumor of Bose's death has caused anxiety among Indians at home and abroad, but this is merely British propaganda intended to sow discord between India and Japan. This claim also demonstrates how worried and concerned Britain is about the Indian independence movement.

### Money Exchange Shop Raises Exchange Rate; Fined 5,000 Yuan

A certain individual named Jia, whose name is unknown, went to the Fuhexing Money Exchange Shop at No. 23 Avenue Edward VII the other day, to exchange 10,000 yuan of old French currency for Reserve Certificates. The market price that day was 1.32 yuan per yuan, but the shop raised the price by one cent. This was discovered by the Chinese police stationed in the shop, who immediately reported it to the French police station. Detective Robert ruled that the shop should not disrupt the financial market and ordered the shop to pay a fine of 5,000 yuan; otherwise, it would be ordered to cease operations.

### Chemical Explosion at Rubber Factory; Indian Constable and Worker Injured

At 10:40 AM yesterday, a certain chemical used in the manufacturing of galoshes suddenly exploded in the workshop of the Continental Rubber Factory at No. 876 Pong Road in East Shanghai.

### French Concession Authorities to Organize Baodu Self-Defense; Combined Organization of Merchants, Residents of Alleys, and Watchmen and Police to Be Stationed for Defense

In order to maintain law and order, eliminate terrorist incidents, suppress bandits, and protect the people's safety, the French Concession authorities are vigorously promoting the Baodu self-defense corps and have begun preparations. The method involves selecting strong young men from various businesses and alley residents, along with patrolmen, to form a mixed organization. The details have already been reported in the newspapers. The French authorities have now ordered businesses and alley residents on various roads and streets to actively prepare, convene meetings in districts and sections to discuss organizational methods. At the same time, shopkeepers and landlords are convening meetings with shop assistants and tenants. Once preparations are completed, an announcement will be made regarding the establishment and implementation, which should not be far off.

### For the Sake of Life, Lin Jim Shines Shoes

— Yee Fei

"Our feelings were originally very good, but life created a gap between us. Life made our love gradually cool down because I didn't have the strength to support a family. The rising prices day and night pressured us to each take care of ourselves." However, I am very grateful to her (referring to Wu Airong) for being able to endure hardships and complaints, placing the entire burden of the family on one person's shoulders. The two children are also about to come of age, but I, as a father, have not given them any of a father's responsibility. All the economic burdens of the family are entirely borne by her alone. How ashamed is that for a husband!"

"My wife's income isn't very high either, so of course, it's impossible to shoulder this heavy burden for the family. However, she also has her ways to barely cope. The children's breakfast is the leftover bread and pastries from the restaurant (where Wu Airong works) every day from the customers. She brings them home after finishing work. As for the children's tuition, this semester, we requested assistance from the Shanghai News readers' scholarship fund."

Speaking of the Shanghai News scholarship fund, I remembered that Lin Jim himself had also requested assistance from the Shanghai News last year to learn typing, so I asked him:

"I remember there was news in the Shanghai News last year that you also requested a scholarship. How is it now?"

"After I completed my typing course, I still couldn't find a job. The cost of living is also so high. If I were to rely on my wife to survive, just like the children, not only would I have no face to face people, but my conscience wouldn't allow it. That's why I picked up this kit to shine shoes for people."

"Shining shoes isn't a lowly profession," I comforted him, "How much can you earn in a day?"

"Ten or twenty yuan. On rainy days, I can only hide at home."

Talking about this, he gestured to ask me if I wanted a shoeshine, but I couldn't resist his sincerity, so I nodded, as the price of interviewing him.

Being able to support oneself with one's own blood and sweat is truly admirable. I hope this loving couple can overcome the difficult times together and live happily ever after!

### Instigated by Concubine, Son and Daughter-in-Law Driven Out

Zhang Wenzhong, a native of Ningbo, currently residing at No. 1, Shengliping Lane, Avenue Edward VII, previously worked as a sailor on the Taikoo Company's Jiangsu and New Beijing vessels. Because his income was meager and insufficient to support his family, he allowed his wife, Chen, to work as a hostess at the Yong'an Tianyunlou Entertainment Venue to supplement their income and support his elderly father, Zhang Jieshang (50 years old). A few years ago, his father, with the help of his brother-in-law, managed to enter the cotton cloth business. In a short time, he accumulated assets of more than 200,000 yuan. In addition to establishing Ankang Cotton Cloth Firm at Zhongdeli, Shanxi Road, Ningbo Road, he also opened Yongda Transportation Company at Deqingli, Shanxi Road, and purchased more than 30 acres of good farmland in his hometown, resembling a wealthy man. However, Zhang Jieshang, despite his age, frequently visited brothels, leading to the acquisition of three beautiful concubines. Enjoying his life of leisure, he treated his son, Zhang Wenzhong, as a thorn in his side due to constant criticism from the concubines. He suddenly drove out his son and daughter-in-law on the 24th of this month and published a statement in the newspaper severing their father-son relationship. Zhang Wenzhong, stimulated by this, attempted suicide but was fortunately rescued. Relatives are currently mediating, hoping to salvage the situation.

### Vegetable Cultivation Methods (Continued)

Necessary Conditions for Vegetable Cultivation. Land: When planting a vegetable garden, first determine the location. For supplying urban consumption, it should be in the suburbs, and the dedicated vegetable garden for processed products must be close to the canning factory to facilitate transportation. The location should be surrounded by rivers for irrigation. Soil: The soil quality of the vegetable garden must be tested, especially for dryness and easy drainage. Fertilizer: Whether artificial or natural fertilizer, it must be applied appropriately. Human manure is commonly used, but it has many parasites and is not suitable for raw vegetables. Fresh human manure should not be applied because it has not yet undergone decomposition. Seeds: The variety of seeds must be selected before improvement. New seeds germinate at 98%, while old ones only germinate at 30-40%. Equipment: Basic agricultural tools and other equipment can be large or small, many or few, depending on the situation. Labor is divided into coarse and fine work, and the number of people depends on the scale.

Vegetable Cultivation Methods. Vegetable sowing is divided into spring sowing, autumn sowing, or sowing in all four seasons. Some methods use seedbeds and then transplant, while others use direct sowing, including row sowing, spot sowing, and broadcast sowing. The depth of sowing, the preparation of the seedbed soil, and the management after sowing are all very important. After the seeds are in the soil, they must be compacted and watered regularly to ensure contact between the seeds and the soil. Cover with rice straw. After the seedlings emerge, they should be exposed to sunlight and no longer covered. Seedlings do not need fertilizer. Be careful of pests. After the seedlings grow, some are transplanted to temporary beds, and some are transplanted to permanent beds, each with its own function. Vegetables also need to be cultivated and weeded, and irrigation should be frequent but not excessive. Fertilization should be timely; too early or too late is ineffective. After harvesting vegetables, attention should be paid to storage methods because when a certain vegetable matures, the market price depreciates. It must be stored for a certain time before being sold to obtain a good price. Storage requires attention to three points: moisture, temperature, and air. For example, potatoes are first stored in a cellar, with sand spread on the bottom, covered with rice straw and soil, and several hollow bamboo poles are inserted to circulate air. This prevents excessive drying, temporarily preserves moisture, and prevents air from being suffocated.

Vegetable Improvement. To operate a vegetable garden, one can only profit if they study and improve cultivation methods; otherwise, they will inevitably work hard in vain. Maintain superior varieties, do not mix with inferior varieties, and prevent the mixing of inferior varieties. One is mechanical, and the other is genetic. For all excellent seeds, we must not only preserve them but also improve them further. Naturally, the vegetables you grow will be more beautiful and larger than ordinary ones, pleasing customers and obtaining a good price for sale.

### Claiming Stolen Felt Hats

The detectives of the Jing'an Temple Police Station recently arrested a criminal who robbed pedestrians of felt hats in the Public Concession. Many stolen felt hats have been retrieved. Therefore, anyone whose felt hat was stolen in the Concession can claim it from the detectives at the Jing'an Temple Police Station.

### Public Concession Police Seize Large Quantity of Firearms; Total of Thirty Arrested in Days of Searching

According to the English-language "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury", over the past few days, the Shanghai Municipal Police conducted searches throughout the Concession, arresting thirty suspects, including several women, and seizing thousands of rounds of ammunition, several machine guns, and eight handguns, including a Japanese Army handgun. The Police Department is currently investigating the activities of these individuals. Previously, the Police Department arrested twenty Chinese in two restaurants at No. 44 Tianjin Road and No. 506, Lane 776, North Sichuan Road. These individuals confessed to hiding a large quantity of ammunition, machine guns, and handguns. On Monday, police officers arrested four men on Avenue Edward VII and seized one Japanese Army handgun and one ordinary handgun each, as well as ten rounds of ammunition. Subsequently, four more people were arrested on Seymour Road, Nanyang Road, and Route Frelupt. Among the twenty suspects, there were also two extortionists who were arrested at the Shanghai Hotel on Zhejiang Road, and explosives, poisons, and drug paraphernalia were seized.

The French General Police Department received a confidential report a few days ago stating that firearms were being hidden in the Jindingshai Cigarette Shop at No. 400, Corner of Rue de Bavier and Route des Soeurs. Supervising Officer Zhu Gunong led detectives to the address to search. Inside the room of the shop owner, Ma Guifang (67 years old, local), they found a six-inch handgun, five bullets, and a complete set of opium smoking paraphernalia. He was taken back to the police station. According to Ma's confession, the handgun was sent to his place by a friend. He smokes opium himself, so he prepared the smoking paraphernalia. The police chief ordered him to be detained for further investigation.

### Spring at the Zoo

— Yi

"Little Jingang, come and see! The lion is raising its head…" A middle-aged man, dressed very plainly, said to the child of about eight or nine years old beside him.

Spring makes people feel lazy and sleepy, especially in the one or two hours after lunch. Eyelids can't stay open, and it seems like even walking makes you doze off. On Saturdays, there are more visitors to Gujiazhai Garden than usual. In the zoo, men, women, old, and young are dragging their feet outside many iron cages, watching them wander east and west, as if their legs have no energy.

Mrs. Tiger and Mr. Lion are always lying there taking a nap. The noisy sounds outside the iron cages are just wind in their ears, they neither pay attention nor react. That "Little Jingang" heard his father's call and leaned over, raising his heels to look at the lion, full of enthusiasm, but what happened? The lion raised its head, then returned to its dreams.

The male African lion is exactly ten years old this year—born in 1932—watching it squat there as if asleep, reminding one of the two bronze lions in front of the HSBC Building on the Bund. Schif mentioned these two lions in his new collection of "Shanghai Cartoons", saying that many people who pass by them always like to rub their front paws, believing that they can "receive blessings", because the bronze of the front paws is much brighter than the rest of the body. However, who would dare to play with this living lion?

The tiger's sleeping posture is particularly unrestrained, simply "prostrate on the ground". She—this tiger is female—is only nine years old—born in 1933, but her body is not petite. Lying completely on the ground, it is like a tiger skin piled in a fur shop, and one can't even feel its vitality.

Beautiful spring, great spring, taming lions and subduing tigers, turning strength into gentleness, it's like stepping into a cotton field, and besides some subtle sounds, nothing is heard.

Circling around, the big white rats born in 1937 are dashing around in the cage, jumping non-stop. It seems that for five years, they have always been living a hectic life. Looking forward, I am afraid that after another five years, they will still be so urgent and "jumping" non-stop.

Small animals are not attractive enough, and many people ran over to look at the monkeys.

The naked monkeys are making all kinds of funny movements—this is from our human point of view—they grab food, chase each other and play. Even if no one is watching outside the cage, they must still be so energetic. The monkey's hyperactivity is truly innate. Their humor comes from "unintentionality" and is not pretentious. Everyone who visits the zoo has this feeling.

Next to the monkey circle, there is a stall selling "monkey food fruits". In today's world where people eat "horse feed", it is okay to make a big deal out of a small matter. Please take a look at the types and prices of monkey food. It lists: peanuts 4 jiao; large bananas 4 jiao, medium bananas 3 jiao; candy 1 jiao; water chestnuts 2 jiao per bag. From a nutritional point of view, these things all have considerable vitamins, especially peanuts and bananas. If ordinary people can eat this kind of "monkey food" every day, wouldn't they also be satisfied? This is what makes the spring of recent years different from the spring of the past.

After seeing the ugly turkeys and the skinny deer, the "feminine" white-feathered peacock actually "opened its screen" in front of many people. The explanatory text hanging outside the cage says that in the spring, males often open their screens to show off their beauty to females. In our view, we thought that the ones opening their screens were always female peacocks, that snow-like brocade screen, spotless, precious fans reflected, with the charm of flowing waves and gaze, pearly and precious, like a grandly dressed noblewoman, but who knew that it was actually male.

Walking past the round pond when leaving the park, white geese and wild ducks followed the waves, and that kind of carefree and natural posture, light and agile movements, made people look at them with joy, forgetting their worries and sorrows, and gaining more comfort and relaxation in their hearts.

### Rice Shop Worker Charged with Pushing Elderly Woman Grinding Rice

### Jealous Rage Leads to Murder of Mistress and Lover: Machine Worker Caught in the Net

Wang Huizhen, a woman residing at No. 391, North Xishan Road, had previously become acquainted with Yan Cai (also known as A Jiu, 27 years old), a Cantonese man working as a machine worker, and lived with him at that address. Unexpectedly, the woman's affections shifted over time, and she fell in love with Fu Suliang, a waiter from Hubei. She abandoned Yan, who became extremely resentful and harbored murderous intent. On December 27th of last year, at around 3 PM, he hid near the entrance of a teahouse with a sharp blade, waiting for an opportunity. When Fu came out, Yan, without asking questions, drew his blade and stabbed wildly. Fu was caught off guard and was stabbed several times in vital areas, resulting in his death. Yan fled the scene immediately after the attack and disappeared. It was not until the other day that the police arrested Yan and brought him to justice.

### Few Transactions in Spot Gold

After the implementation of centralized control of spot gold, it is said that the permits have not yet been issued, making it inconvenient to move goods. Traders are increasingly idle. Transactions in the black market are scarce, and most are closing positions. The gold price was suddenly raised to 20 yuan by the Shanghai Customs, and news of the issuance of gold treasury bills further strengthened the market. The price jumped to over 18,000 yuan. At the beginning of the morning, it was 18,050 yuan, 250 yuan higher than the closing price of the previous day. A certain gang bought a small amount at 18,150 yuan, but a certain gold firm and a certain household sold. The price briefly fell to 18,000 yuan before rising again. At 11 o'clock, it was 18,100 yuan. Later, the black market price rose again to 18,200-18,300 yuan, an increase of 400-500 yuan from the previous day. In the afternoon, it rose further to 18,500-18,600 yuan with buyers. The selling price of gold ornaments per tael at Daxin and other firms was raised by 50 yuan to 1,950 yuan (buying price reduced by 200 yuan).

### Government Bonds Rebound Strongly

In the gray market for government bonds, the market rebounded yesterday with a strong upward trend. This is because the end-of-month settlement period has passed, and this phenomenon would not normally occur. However, due to the tight credit situation, it was necessary to settle and borrow again, showing that the so-called tight credit is only tight for some while others are loose. At the beginning of the market yesterday, Dahua sold on behalf of a certain firm, for a total of about 400,000 yuan. Huachang took the opportunity to cover short positions by about 100,000 yuan. Then, Tongyuan and Chengkang each bought in nearly 100,000 yuan. The other firms, Hu Heji, Tongli, Shunli, Xinhua, and Hefeng, had frequent transactions, mostly buying more than selling. When Class C bonds were near 4 yuan, Tongyi suddenly made a large purchase, instantly pushing the price up to 5 yuan. Although Da Zhong, Hongxing, Runde, Yiji, Hengyu, Jiufeng, Qing'an Jiufu, Shunting, and Da Kangcheng all offered varying amounts for sale, Yuxing, Gongmao, and Tongkang came in to buy. At the close of the market, prices remained very firm, resulting in a uniform rebound of 9 jiao to 1.3 yuan. Turnover was approximately 700,000-800,000 yuan. A brief summary table is listed below.

### Eastern Piece Goods Warehouse Certificate Trading as Lively as Ever

Factory Cloth: The morning market was weak, but the afternoon market rebounded due to the rise in Eastern Piece Goods. The asking prices were uniformly firm, but there was little change from the previous day's market. Spot transactions depend on the convenience of the movement permit, so buyers on this street are still watching. There were very few transactions.

Eastern Cloth: Started weak but ended strong. The warehouse certificate trading was as lively as ever. The opening price for 12-pound Longtou Fine Cloth new certificate was 224 yuan. It once fell to 128 yuan, but rose again to 223 yuan at noon. The afternoon market was strong due to foreign firms searching for medium-grade cloths and serge.

Old certificate was 205 yuan, Flying Fish Color Ball was 207 yuan, Yang He was 206 yuan, Trumpet was 204 yuan, Baby Fine Twill was 175 yuan, and Five Blessings Double Fish Twill was 180 yuan, all up 5-6 yuan from the previous day. The Huang factory certificate for Four Gentlemen Serge also rose to 6.9 yuan in the evening, and the Red new certificate was 6.75 yuan.

### Zigon Cloth

Zigon cloth is currently very scarce, and the trend is very strong. Firms in the industry and tailors with financial resources are all searching for it. Factory production has ceased completely, and shipments of both Western and Eastern goods have disappeared. The old stock has been sold off one after another, and prices are rising higher and higher. Yesterday, the highest-grade cloth being shipped from the road was being offered for 250-260 yuan per yard, and the average was above 200 yuan. The highest-grade Japanese goods were at 180 yuan, and the average was 150 yuan. All were empty offers, with transactions but no market.

### High-Grade Cigarettes Expensive and Popular

Cagliac Cigarettes at 42 Yuan per Tin

Among cigarette sales, the prices of mid-range goods are increasing slowly, and Blue Label has little stimulus. Actual sales are also mediocre and sluggish. Speculators are less active. Only the top-grade brands are still moving forward. The stock in the market is becoming increasingly scarce, so popularity is even greater. For example, 50-piece Cagliac cigarettes are retailing for as high as 41-42 yuan per tin. Only a small number are available for sale. 5-piece Datap cigarettes are at 5,600 yuan, Xiaotap cigarettes are at 4,900 yuan, Envoy brand is at 3,000 yuan, Datap Front Gate is at 3,400 yuan, and 3-5 brand is at 7,200 yuan. 20-piece Dananwei is at 5,000 yuan, and 50-piece Tainanwei is at 7,500 yuan, all based on a price of 10,000 cigarettes.

### Difficult to Transport Soap, Candles, and Matches

- The market is already quiet -

In the daily necessities market, the trend is fluctuating. The owners are watching the situation, and buyers are finding it difficult to transport goods, resulting in slow sales. Market prices have not changed much. Phoenix brand matches are trading at 7,000 yuan, Beauty brand is at 7,200 yuan, and miscellaneous brands are at 5,900 yuan. Guben soap is at 360 yuan per box, Bai Xiangmao soap is at 325 yuan, Huang Xiangmao soap is at 310 yuan, Arrow Knife soap is at 315 yuan, White Label foreign candles are at 210 yuan, and Seng brand is at 205 yuan.

### Black Fungus Rose Another Thousand Yuan

Due to the scarcity of black fungus sources and the potential changes to the currency system, everything is rising in price, and new highs are being set. Recently, the price for high-quality clear water fungus has reached 4,500 yuan, an increase of another thousand yuan compared to the middle of last month. Yesterday, the market price for top-grade Post Office fungus was 4,200 yuan, and the next grade was 4,000 yuan.

### Only Diao Qing Sugar from China is Available for Transport: The Combined Price Has Also Increased

The market supply of domestic sugar has been exhausted. The only type of sugar from China that may be available for transport is Longxi Diao Qing sugar. Recently, there have been frequent inquiries from customers. The market price has recently risen due to military notes, and the combined price is even higher. The current market price is around 410 yuan and is expected to gradually approach (blank space).

### Very Few Transactions in Coarse Grains

Yesterday's coarse grain transactions were scarce, as the new measures for centralized control of materials have not yet been announced. Both buyers and sellers are deeply concerned about the inconvenience of transportation, so there were very few transactions. Apart from soybean cake, which saw some trading among hoarders, there were very few other transactions. The total market traded 2,500 pieces of Hankou soybean cake at a price of 37 yuan to 40.2 yuan. 1,860 pieces of Feizi soybean cake for November certificate traded at 47 yuan to 47.8 yuan. 2,000 pieces of Lizi soybean cake for March certificate traded at 54.5 yuan to 55 yuan. 16 bags of Chongming Shachi traded at 210 yuan to 214 yuan, and 100 bags of Fork Sand Silkworm traded at 147 yuan. The market trend was upward across the board.

### Medicinal Euryale Ferox Seeds Rising Steadily

Medicinal euryale ferox seeds have been in short supply recently, and the market stock is not high. In addition, the new harvest season is still far away, so amid rising prices for all goods, they are also rising steadily. Yesterday, the market price for white-skinned medicinal euryale ferox seeds was 400 yuan, an increase of 80 yuan. Red-skinned goods were slightly lower, but still not willing to concede much. The market outlook is promising.

### Domestic Rice Traded, But No Market

Recently, domestic rice has been rarely seen from peddlers in the suburbs. In addition, from April 1st, the transportation of designated materials will be subject to centralized control and will be distributed by the authorities. Yesterday, it was said that there were some stocks available, offered for 285 yuan, with rumors of 400 yuan in the British Concession. However, as transportation is prohibited, it is feared that this price is not real. There is trading, but no market.

### 波羅蜜 (Continued)

— Gao Jiannong

Only then did I realize that my speculation was surprisingly accurate! According to the records in "Lingwai Daida," it says: "The jackfruit is as big as a half-sheng bowl. Upon closer inspection, dozens of segments are clustered into a ball. Each segment has a seam, like an uncracked cypress seed, tightly clustered and very hard to break without an axe. It is green in winter and turns red in summer. Breaking the segments to eat it, it is slightly sweet. The seedling clusters are about ten feet tall and become trunks. The leaves are as long as water chestnuts, with thorns on both sides. The locals plant them densely as fences, or dry the leaves, remove the thorns, and weave mats. Lying on them makes a rustling sound." This description of the fruit's shape, color, and taste; the description of the seedling clusters; the description of "leaves as long as water chestnuts, with thorns on both sides" and that they can be woven into mats, is indeed pineapple, beyond any doubt! Moreover, when Wu Qijun recorded the various names of this fruit in "Plant Names and Reality Atlas," almost all of them can be explained. However, the official name he emphasized, "Ludouzi," left us bewildered as to its origin. Now that we see how similar the sounds of "Ludouzi" and "Luzi" are, we can understand that this is just a phonetic shift, a slight difference in translation from a foreign language! It is likely that these two names were derived from "transliteration," but unfortunately, we don't know if it came from Vietnamese or Burmese... Judging from this: "Lingwai Daida" was written in the year 1179 AD,

and "Guihai Yuheng Zhi" was even earlier. This means that China already had jackfruit more than three hundred years before the discovery of the New World. How can we say that its homeland is in America? This matter is not about boasting original ideas, nor is it deliberately innovating and creating novelty. The facts are all there, and no one can erase them!

As for why this fruit is called "Jackfruit" and "Dalochui," Wu Qijun explained it in detail in "Plant Names and Reality Atlas." He quoted "Lingnan Zaji" saying: "The custard apple is as big as a peach, green in color, and the skin resembles lychee shells but is not a shell. It has a cluster of leaves on top. When broken open, the pulp is white and the seeds are black, tasting like jackfruit." He also quoted "Sifangting Caifang": "The 'Dalochui' leaves resemble orchid leaves but are thicker and stronger, about an inch wide and over a foot long, with serrated thorns on the edges. The fruit grows from the seedling, with scaly patterns on the skin. When ripe, it is yellow, as big as a bowl but slightly longer, resembling a mallet, hence the name. It tastes very delicious. When cut and placed in a vase, it remains fragrant for over a month..." He also quoted Luo Guancha, named Tianchi, from Yixi, saying: "Dalochui... has hard leaves with thorns... turns yellow in autumn, tastes like cantaloupe, and fills the room with fragrance. It is produced in Zhen, Kang, Pu, and Dian. The Yi people treasure it, and it is jackfruit." Therefore, he concluded: "Dalochui resembles its shape, and jackfruit suggests its taste. Both are names that originally did not exist."

What are the benefits of jackfruit? Because its light yellow flesh has a delicious taste that melts in the mouth, sometimes as sweet as honey peaches, sometimes as sour as Chinese bayberries, and sometimes as fragrant as apples, it is very popular. However, its greatest advantage is that its juice contains a substance similar to pepsin, which has the function of digesting proteins. Therefore, eating it is like taking a digestive medicine. From this, we can know that the true purpose of nature in creating all things is to nourish and benefit people, and the taste and color are merely means to attract people to achieve this true purpose. When jackfruit ripens, it emits an extremely pleasant fragrance, so the things quoted earlier say, "When cut and placed in a vase, it remains fragrant for over a month..." However, the jackfruit sold in fruit stores in Shanghai is completely picked when it is half-ripe, so we cannot enjoy this fragrance. As for how to eat jackfruit: the most common way is to eat it raw or make canned fruit. It can also be used to make fruit jam, ice cream, or other beverages. The fiber of its leaves can also be used to make paper or weave things. Didn't Zhou Qufei of the Song Dynasty already say that its leaves can be "woven into mats, and lying on them makes a rustling sound"?

Although the homeland of jackfruit is not necessarily in the New World, since Europeans discovered the New World and also saw this precious plant, they have worked hard to promote it and have also transplanted it to various parts of the world, wherever the climate and soil are suitable for it.

### The Rejuvenation of Dogs

— Xu Ge

How many people in the world can welcome "old age"? Maupassant once said that seeing white hair on a friend's head made him start to worry about him.

Time flies by, and there is no way to reverse aging. What is meant by preserving youth and retaining a youthful appearance is just talk. Medicine has not yet reached that level. However, despite this, researchers of rejuvenation are still moving forward.

Dr. Du Nuoai of the Locke Institute of Medical Research in New York, in his book "The Biological Age," recorded an article on the rejuvenation of dogs, which described the experiment conducted by Dr. Carrel. The principle is to remove the old blood from the dog's body and replace it with artificially manufactured new blood. As a result, an eighteen-year-old dog—eighteen dog years, equivalent to eighty or ninety human years—which was originally curled up in the corner of the wall, with no light in its eyes, and whose fur was gradually falling out, actually became active all over after the operation and regained its lost youth!

Dr. Du described the general situation of this experiment as follows: After being anesthetized, the old dog slept on the operating table. Dr. Carrel cut open its arteries, drew out two-thirds of its blood, separated the red blood cells from the blood, washed them in "Ringer's" solution, mixed them with fresh solution, and injected them back into the dog's body. This artificial blood flowed into the heart and began to circulate, and then the skin was sewn up. After a few days, the old dog regained its original strength and its appetite also improved. Such blood transfusion operations were performed several times in a row, almost replacing all of the blood. This artificial solution contained only salt, such as sodium chloride, calcium, and potassium, in addition to blood cells, and its composition was the same as the blood in the dog's body.

After several operations, this old dog not only was still alive, but also transformed from its previous decrepit state into a lively and agile dog. It had stopped jumping and barking for several years, but now it had recovered. The fur that had fallen out grew back, and its whole body appeared radiant. Most surprisingly, even its "unperturbed" and indifferent attitude towards the opposite sex had been restored.

If this method can be applied to humans, then spring will not only belong to young people.

### Food Creates People

— Shi Dong

Can parents who are tall definitely give birth to tall children? Can we find a way to make short people grow taller?

This is a question that has been a mystery for thousands of years, but now scientists have finally obtained a satisfactory answer. According to recent scientific discoveries, food and the human body have a great relationship. Therefore, as long as you tell scientists what food you eat, they can tell you what kind of person you are.

A strange thing happened in northern India: the Sikhs and Pathans (according to Shanghai and other places, Indian constables belong to this ethnic group) living in the same environment as the Madras people in the south grew to be over six feet tall, becoming magnificent and stalwart men, while the Madras people were all thin and short. This strange phenomenon aroused the curiosity and exploration of Sir Robert McCarrison of the Indian Army Medical Corps.

Eating acidic yogurt, a small amount of meat, a large amount of leafy vegetables, potatoes, and bread made from high-quality flour every day is the most ideal diet from a chemical point of view. And this is the food of the Sikhs and Pathans. Rice, red pepper, tamarind (evergreen tree of the bean family, the fruit can be made into a refreshing drink), dried fish, and porridge are obviously not very helpful for increasing height. And this is the food of the Madras people. From here, we can see the cause and effect. But for scientists, relying solely on reasoning is not enough, they also need to do experiments themselves.

I saw twelve white rat cages—these contained the offspring, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren of the same pair of male and female rats—lined up on the wall of Sir McCarrison's laboratory. These white rats had been safely placed in cages since they were young to prevent them from being attacked by germs, and they were also well-fed by diet experts. But each rat in the cage was very different from its neighbor, just like the Madras people and the Pathans were very different.

Accustomed to the usual docile laboratory animals, I approached the first cage carelessly. Suddenly, I heard the master of the cage make an angry "boo-boo-boo" sound. A fat white rat took an aggressive stance towards me. Its fur was rough, and its face was fiercely raised. It seemed ready to fight at any challenge. Since weaning, it had been eating white bread spread with jam, cooked beef, cooked lamb, cooked fish, cooked vegetables, and boiled tea.

Its neighbor was entirely raised on the diet of the Sikhs and Pathans. It seemed not at all agitated by the surrounding disturbances, and its round red eyes showed extreme calmness, focusing only on chewing its food. It was as big as the previous one, but its fur was shiny and smooth; it was very gentle to people.

A small white rat that was very healthy but not much larger than a mole lived next door. It was a white rat that ate the diet of the Madras people.

The white rat in the cage over there was short, with a wide waist, greasy fur, and the tips of its whiskers curled up. At a glance, you could tell that it was a white rat accustomed to eating rich fatty stews, meat chops covered in spicy soy sauce, and raw vegetables immersed in seasonings.

Such a big difference occurred in the descendants of the same male and female rats, and this was the result obtained from the experiment in order to solve the above mystery. We simply couldn't believe that so many white rats—tall, short, fat, thin, fierce, gentle, agile, cautious...—actually belonged to the same ancestor.

### Understanding

Essay

### Time

— Xiao Feng

Have you ever thought: you did some ridiculous things, or you did some very right things. Time makes you understand yourself better. And you will understand that your days have not been completely wasted.

Sometimes it takes several years before you can determine the value of your actions. Only time will allow you to see the whole process of things developing, how the former affected the latter, and no matter how big or small; so you must not neglect it. Our predecessors have left us with painful experiences, the so-called one wrong step will cause eternal regret.

True value needs to be tempered by time, not in temporary gains and losses.

### Bookstores in Berlin

— He Kai

In the bookstores of Berlin, we rarely see books that cater to the times and cause a sensation, but mostly hard and serious publications. Dictionaries, maps, travel books, and science books are especially so. This trend probably affects the bookstores themselves. In Berlin, bookstores seem to have been carefully selected and are very few in number. The scene of bookstores lining up like scales on Fuzhou Road in Shanghai is extremely rare.

Especially bookstores that sell specialized books are simply as rare as stars in Berlin. For example, there is only one bookstore that specializes in selling maps, and only three or four bookstores that specialize in selling law books. Even in Leipzig, the publishing center of Germany, specialized bookstores are very, very few.

Generally speaking, bookstores in Berlin can be divided into specialized bookstores that sell specialized books and ordinary bookstores that sell general books. Ordinary bookstores mostly sell novels and popular science books, while specialized bookstores sell a large number of old books in addition to specialized books. They seem to have a group of regular customers who specialize in searching for books in a certain field for them, so they have to expand their scope and include old books in their merchandise.

One of the characteristics of the bookstore scene in Germany is that there are very few customers in the store who aim to browse the books but have no intention of buying them. This is partly because most bookstores in Germany do not sell magazines. People who go to bookstores are prepared to buy a certain book, so there is no crowding in the bookstore.

The names of medical stores mostly use the surname of the owner, but among the specialized bookstores, there are also odd names such as "Bibliomaniac."

Invention

### Steel House

— Zhang Qiao

The Dimasing Company in New Jersey, USA, has invented a steel house, which is nailed together with twenty corrugated panels. The steel house is twenty feet in diameter, twelve feet high, and weighs one and a half tons. It has ten "porthole" windows around it and fifteen skylights on the roof. Inside, it is divided into four rooms with tents. The steel house is most suitable for workers to live in, because it is cheap to build, about 750 US dollars, and it is also quick to build, it can be built in six days, and it can be dismantled in two days.

### Through Storms Together

(2) Sorrow and Joy

Li Youxie was already moved by Qin Runzhi's silver tongue, let alone Madam Ye and the eldest daughter. The eldest daughter was eager to discuss it with Wei Cheng, but Madam Ye hesitated and said, "Wei Cheng is filial, but this matter is too big, I'm afraid he won't agree." Li Youxie looked out the window and saw many people standing in the courtyard, waiting for news from inside, and said, "This matter must be guided slowly. Let's all put in some effort. Why hasn't Sister Zhou's husband come yet?" The eldest daughter said, "He's not at home. He went to the county town to pay taxes. The price will go up after the New Year. He won't be back until tomorrow. When he comes, he can help persuade Wei Cheng. Now, I'll go and call Wei Cheng."

The eldest daughter went away, and Madam Ye expressed some personal opinions, saying, "We haven't met the Wei family's daughter. We've only heard the matchmaker say good things about her. If you're talking about the person, Cui Zhen is more suitable." Li Youxie waved his hand and said, "She's an orphan, and Fei Changhe is the one in charge: it's more difficult. We'll talk about Cui Zhen after Wei Cheng rejects Miss Wei." The eldest daughter led Wei Cheng, whose eyes were red and swollen, to the Shuangmei Study. Wei Cheng came in, didn't see anyone else, but first saw the portrait of Lord Aitang. Unconsciously, tears streamed down his face, and he knelt down on both knees. Madam Ye quickly helped him up and said, "Child, Mom has already passed away. It's her destiny, and there's no way to reverse it. You should take care of your own body now. If you get sick from grief, your Mom will still be shedding tears underground. Your uncle and aunt all love you. We are planning for the Ye family, and also planning for your Mom to be at peace underground. There is something to discuss with you." (39)
