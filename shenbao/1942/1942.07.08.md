The convening of this Working Committee is expected to produce a final vote on this issue, attracting widespread attention.

### German Air and Naval Forces Attack British and American Convoy in the Arctic Ocean; One Cruiser, One Merchant Ship, and Twenty-Eight Vessels Sunk

Berlin, Huitong News Agency dispatch dated the 7th: The following is the content of a special communiqué issued from the Führer's headquarters regarding the enemy's loss of 28 merchant ships in the Arctic Ocean: Since July 2nd, German air and naval forces have been pursuing an enemy convoy en route to the Soviet Union, 300 miles off the northern coast of Norway, between North Cape and Spitsbergen.

A merchant ship was immediately hit by a torpedo. The warship then dropped depth charges on the submarine. The Navy Department also announced that a Swedish warship escorting merchant ships near the west coast of Öland in Swedish territorial waters had opened fire on a submarine of unknown nationality that appeared in the nearby waters. The Navy Department did not say whether the submarine was the same one that attacked the Swedish convoy near Landsort Island.

Stockholm, Huitong News Agency dispatch dated the 7th: The news that a Soviet submarine attacked a Swedish merchant ship within Swedish territorial waters yesterday and was repelled by a Swedish warship is being prominently featured in the local newspapers this morning. Most newspapers are publishing photographs of the destroyed Soviet torpedo boat. Well-informed sources in Sweden reveal that Soviet torpedo boats have taken such actions as many as five times in recent days. The Swedish ship "Fortuna" was attacked by a torpedo last Saturday, and was only half a meter away, and survived the attack. Sweden has decided to continue taking measures to protect its neutrality.

### British and New Zealand Forces Launch Major Counteroffensive in the Alamein Area of Egypt; Massive Tanks Deployed to the Front Lines; Axis Blitz Halted

Stockholm, Huitong News Agency dispatch dated the 7th: Military circles in London stated yesterday that the British counteroffensive in the Alamein area of Egypt is not a large-scale one. The Reuters military correspondent in North Africa said that the New Zealand army is the main force in the fighting in the Alamein area of Egypt.

From a location on the Egyptian border, Havas News Agency dispatch dated the 6th: There have been no major changes in the Egyptian war situation today. Fierce fighting continues southwest of the Alamein area. According to news from Cairo, General Auchinleck is taking the offensive at several points, attempting to drive Axis forces out of their positions southwest of Alamein. Over the past 24 hours, British forces have launched repeated major counterattacks under the cover of artillery and tanks. Allied air forces are also continuously bombing German and Italian transportation lines. However, General Auchinleck's strategy cannot be considered decisive, as it only aims to defeat the Axis forces' advancing power. Therefore, military observers in Cairo generally believe that the situation has improved, but should not be overly optimistic. The British defensive line remains unmoved. General Auchinleck's aim is not only to keep Axis forces in their original positions, but also to defeat the Axis forces before General Rommel organizes supply lines through Tobruk and Benghazi. Everything now depends on whether General Auchinleck can obtain reinforcements in the shortest possible time. Rumors that General Rommel intends to advance towards the Siwa Oasis (100 miles south of Bardia) and then attack the Nile River Valley are not credible, as this would encounter significant difficulties. Historically, only the army of Alexander the Great attempted to invade from east to west, but since then, no one has dared to enter the desert.

Bern, Havas News Agency dispatch dated the 6th: The Swiss newspaper "Neue Zürcher Zeitung" recently reported that all sectors in London have been extremely optimistic since receiving the latest news from North Africa. The general public believes that General Auchinleck has completed the task of reorganizing the remnants of the Eighth Army and assigning them to the Egyptian Army and Near East Forces, and has deployed new massive tanks to the front lines. These tanks are comparable to German Mark tanks. In addition, a large number of aircraft are active, attacking the enemy's supply lines, especially the port of Benghazi, which has suffered significant losses. However, General Rommel will soon be able to transfer reinforcements from Greece and Crete and obtain supplies from Italy and Tobruk. Therefore, London should not be overly optimistic. General Auchinleck's main problem is whether he can react swiftly and be more rapid than General Rommel. Opening a second front in Europe is becoming increasingly important, as it is necessary to restrain enemy forces and alleviate General Auchinleck's difficulties.

Bern, Havas News Agency dispatch dated the 7th: The "Neue Zürcher Zeitung's" correspondent in London recently cabled that London is expressing complete confidence in the battle in the Alamein area of Egypt. The extreme caution and silence that British war correspondents had previously shown has completely changed their tone. One of them asserted that the first German offensive towards the Nile Delta has been repelled. At the same time, British military observers do not underestimate the danger posed by the enemy's pressure on Alexandria. The strategy that General Auchinleck, the Commander-in-Chief of the British Forces in the Middle East, should adopt after repelling the enemy's initial offensive is currently under discussion. There are now two possible trends in the future of the war situation: whether the British have sufficient mechanized reserves to launch a counteroffensive and whether British bombing is sufficient to prevent the enemy's supply train from supporting the advance of armored units. At present, both sides will take full advantage of their time to mobilize troops and prepare their generals.

US Troops Participate in North African Campaign; Washington Confirms

Buenos Aires, Tongmeng News Agency dispatch dated the 7th: According to news from Washington, the US War Department yesterday publicly disclosed for the first time that US troops are already in the thick of fighting, confirming rumors that have been circulating in Washington and other capitals around the world in recent days.

They were part of an American armored corps observer team that had arrived in North Africa several weeks prior.

Istanbul, Havas News Agency dispatch dated the 6th: All trains on the eastern branch of the railroad have been requisitioned to transport Allied troops and military supplies to Syria and Egypt. As a result, rail traffic in Iraq and Turkey is now completely cut off. In addition, all types of cars have been requisitioned by the authorities.

### Gailani Advocates for Egyptian Revolt Against Britain, Saying the Opportunity to Fight for Freedom Should Not Be Missed

Berlin, Havas News Agency dispatch dated the 6th: Gailani, the pro-Axis leader and former Prime Minister of Iraq, gave a broadcast address to the Egyptian people today, calling for a revolt against Britain. He stated briefly that the Suez Canal must belong to Egypt. Egypt will be the first country among Islamic nations to fight for freedom and break away from British shackles. Any force that oppresses us is our mortal enemy, past, present, and future. Egypt is now at the forefront of this freedom war and will not be isolated. All Arab neighbors are inextricably linked to it, as Palestine, Syria, and Iraq are all under British oppression. Britain has broken its promises countless times, and they have always deceived the people with sweet words.

Egypt Improves Air Defense Measures

Ankara, Huitong News Agency dispatch dated the 7th: The Egyptian Minister of Health and the Minister of Defense have initiated the establishment of an Air Defense Committee, as Egypt's current air defense equipment is extremely incomplete. The committee held a meeting in Cairo yesterday and decided to immediately build public air raid shelters and improve the shortcomings of past air defense measures.

Egyptian Strike Wave Not to Be Taken Lightly

Tokyo, Tongmeng News Agency dispatch dated the 7th: According to a "Yomiuri Shimbun" special dispatch from Sweden, sources in neutral Cairo report that workers in all of Egypt's major industries suddenly began a general strike on the 6th, citing harsh working conditions. The Egyptian government is deeply concerned and has warned the unions, demanding that the workers return to work within two days, or the military will be immediately deployed to enforce compliance. At the same time, it has ordered the formation of a special committee composed of labor and management representatives to study compromise methods. It is believed that the workers will reject this proposal. British authorities believe that the strike has been instigated by nationalists and have adopted a tough stance. The development of the situation is worthy of serious attention.

### German Forces Launch All-Out Offensive; Fierce Battle Rages in the Don Region; Germans Announce Capture of Voronezh; Soviet Forces Launch Counter-Offensive in the Orel Region

Reuters dispatch from Bear City, July 7th: According to today's news, a division of German forces under General Kleist has breached Soviet defenses at several points along the Kursk-Kharkov front and has occupied Voronezh. This city is a key point in the Soviet defenses on the eastern side of the Don River. It is reported that the Germans have deployed a large force of one million troops and are currently advancing through the gap created by the breakthrough on the Ukrainian front. London sources have not confirmed the capture of Voronezh, but they have stated that German forces have already advanced to the outer defenses of this important city on the Moscow-Rostov railway. Moscow sources acknowledge that German forces have continued to make significant progress at several points on the central Soviet front. The Germans are currently advancing towards the main Soviet transportation routes behind the Don River. The Soviets are resisting with the heaviest KV-type tanks, each weighing 50 tons. It is reported that the situation in the central Kursk area is particularly serious for the Soviets. German armored car and tank divisions are continuing their intensive attacks. The Germans appear to be using their successful tactics of breaking through defenses with tanks, followed by infantry. Under this intense attack, the Soviets have been forced to retreat repeatedly.

Havas dispatch from an undisclosed location on the Soviet border, July 6th: German forces under General Bock have launched a new offensive in the northeastern Orel region, advancing along a line parallel to the Tula-Orel railway. Their objective appears to be to reach the railway line connecting Moscow to Voronezh. It is reported that German forces in this area had established defensive positions along the Zhizdra River two months ago and are now launching their offensive from this position. According to the latest reports, German forces have reached the town of Maslovka, northeast of Orel, which not only threatens the Moscow-Rostov railway but also the Tula-Kuibyshev railway. It is estimated that the combined forces on both sides of the front number no less than 200 divisions, with a large number of reserves in the rear ready to reinforce at any time. It is reported that General Timoshenko has also launched a counter-offensive in the Orel region, with the aim of flanking the German forces attacking the upper reaches of the Zhizdra River from the rear, or at least forcing General Bock to move northeast.

Havas dispatch from the Swiss capital, July 7th: According to Berlin sources, German political figures are confident that the German spring offensive plan will achieve significant success before winter. Although the German offensive in the Don region has achieved initial success, the Red Army still has a large number of reserves and armaments. The Red Army Commander-in-Chief has not lost all initiative, as evidenced by the Red Army's counter-offensive in the Orel region.

Reuters dispatch from the German Führer Headquarters, July 7th: This afternoon, the German military communique stated that our forces have crossed the Don River and captured the important industrial city of Voronezh.

Reuters Urgent dispatch from Berlin, July 7th: Well-informed military sources in Berlin revealed that the strategically important city of Voronezh, located on the east bank of the Don River, has been captured by German forces. The railway connecting Rostov to Moscow passes through this city, and there is now a risk that oil transported from the Caucasus to Moscow will be cut off by the Germans. Voronezh is located 200 kilometers east of Kursk.

Havas dispatch from the Swedish capital, July 6th: Moscow Radio has just released a battle report stating that fierce fighting is taking place west of Voronezh and southwest of Stary Oskol. Our forces have abandoned several villages and towns. The fighting on the Kursk front is also extremely intense. Our tank forces annihilated a regiment of enemy infantry and a battery of artillery. Nothing else is worth mentioning on other fronts. Reuters correspondent in Moscow reports that Soviet forces, under intense German pressure, have made an orderly retreat from the Kursk, Belgorod, and Volchansk sectors. Soviet newspapers also acknowledge that German forces have broken through Soviet defenses at several points, and Soviet forces have been forced to retreat. The German forces used in the sector east of Kursk consisted of four armored divisions, five or six infantry divisions, and two mechanized divisions. The terrain in that area is a plain, with only a few rivers as obstacles for mechanized units, which are easily overcome. According to the latest news from Moscow, Soviet forces have recently launched a vigorous counter-offensive, halting the German advance. The Red Army's official newspaper, "Red Star," also confirms that German pressure north of Kursk is increasing, and the situation in Belgorod is particularly serious. The Germans are currently advancing northeast, apparently aiming to link up with the right flank of General Bock's army. The Soviets acknowledge that the Germans occupied an important position there yesterday, but tank and infantry units are still engaged in fierce fighting. According to Soviet sources, although the Germans have made progress, they have paid a heavy price. In one sector alone, the Germans have suffered 1,200 casualties and lost 50 tanks. It is reported that General Timoshenko's forces have launched several counter-offensives on the southern and central fronts. Despite heavy rain in the Rzhev and Gzhatsk regions, fierce fighting continues. In addition, the German offensive on the Kalinin-Moscow line, which began last Thursday, also appears to have achieved significant gains. The Soviets indicate that the German forces on that line outnumber the Soviet forces, and German tanks have broken through Soviet defenses. The Germans claim that due to recent weather conditions, the German command has not been able to fully exploit its advantages.

German Summer Offensive Aims to Reach Volga River

Reuters dispatch from the Swedish capital, July 7th: Berlin dispatches to Swedish newspapers state that once Germany has achieved its objectives in the central Soviet offensive, its next move will almost certainly be a large-scale offensive in the southernmost sector of the Soviet front, with the Volga River region as its target. Berlin feels that General Bock will attempt to reach the Volga River in the next offensive. Hitler's operational plan is to capture the Caucasus, Leningrad, and Murmansk before the end of the summer campaign and to deploy German forces on the banks of the Volga River.

British and Americans Emphasize Eastern Front Situation; Public Opinion Calls for Opening of New Battlefield

Havas dispatch from London, July 6th: British observers generally believe that the situation on the Eastern Front appears to be becoming extremely serious and is likely to cause all sorts of major consequences.

Havas dispatch from Washington, July 6th: Since news of the German advance to the Don River arrived from the Soviet front, American circles have attached great importance to it. Public opinion is unanimously calling for the immediate opening of a second front in Europe to divert German forces and provide some assistance to the Soviet Union in this difficult and arduous environment. According to military experts here, the German aim is to capture the city of Voronezh in order to cut off the Moscow-Rostov railway. If the Germans are able to achieve this objective, the Southern Red Army will be isolated, and its supply of military supplies will become more difficult. At that time, the German offensive against the Caucasus region will be more convenient. The only solution now is for Britain to immediately invade the coasts of France, Belgium, and the Netherlands, regardless of the danger. However, according to Major Seversky, author of "Victory Through Air Power," a second front cannot be opened on the European continent until the Allied air forces have achieved absolute superiority, because landing on the European coast requires bombing of German transportation lines first. In addition, according to the well-known American political commentator Williams, the Allied number of pilots is not enough to protect the army landing, but should take action now. Even if it fails, it should be done by the army and navy first. In short, I can assert that invading the European continent is easier now than in the past.

### Argentina National Day Commemoration; President Castillo Reaffirms Determination to Maintain Peace; Resolves to Defend National Sovereignty With All His Might; Unwilling to Unreasonably Participate in Any War

Reuters dispatch from the Argentine capital, July 7th: The Argentine army and navy held a banquet yesterday to celebrate National Day. The new Argentine President Castillo also attended and delivered a speech, reaffirming Argentina's determination to maintain peace. General Panding, the former Minister of National Defense, first delivered a speech on behalf of the army and navy, saying, "All of our officers and soldiers have great faith in the President's attitude of assistance at this difficult time and consider it a great honor. President Castillo handles state affairs based on the interests of the entire nation and is able to win the hearts of the people. The neutral policy pursued by the President does not neglect cooperation with other friendly nations in the Americas. This alone is enough to prove President Castillo's ardent patriotism and will never harm Argentina's sovereignty. President Castillo's position is supported by the entire people." President Castillo then delivered a reply, saying, "We respect others and therefore respect ourselves. We deeply hope that the policy based on reciprocity will not be undermined by one side. Some professional agitators are taking advantage of the situation and confusing the public under the name of democracy. They should go to the battlefield to work, not just cause trouble in the rear. There are also enemies of democracy within our own class, so I cannot allow them to interfere with the government's policies. The government will defend the sovereignty of the country with all its might and will not lose the dignity of the country. This can be reported to the entire people. At this difficult time, the joint responsibility of the officers and soldiers of the army and navy to defend the country is greater than before. We love peace and are unwilling to participate in any war unreasonably. Pan-Americanism is used to promote the close relationship between the nations of the Americas, not to launch a war."

Cargo Ship Bombing Incident; Ministry of Foreign Affairs Issues Statement

The Argentine Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued an important statement today. The full text is as follows: "On June 30, this Ministry received a note from the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs forwarded by the Argentine Embassy in Germany. The note acknowledged the protest filed by Argentina on June 26 regarding the sinking of the Argentine ship 'Tercero' by a torpedo fired by a German submarine and expressed its apologies. In order to maintain diplomatic relations between the two countries, Germany is willing to compensate for the losses. However, according to the report of the commander of the submarine, he and his crew were unable to identify the ship's national emblem, which is probably the truth. The note also stated that this Ministry has recently received reports from various locations stating that German submarines allowed ships to continue sailing after identifying that they belonged to Argentine nationality and did not cause any difficulties. This shows that German submarines have no intention of deliberately insulting the Argentine flag. As for the Argentine government's request for permission for Argentine ships to freely pass through, the German government believes that as long as Argentine merchant ships clearly display their national emblems, they will not be attacked by German submarines." The Ministry of Foreign Affairs statement also stated, "Today, this Ministry also sent a note to the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs, stating that the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs' reply has been reviewed in its entirety, but based on the results of the investigation by this country's government, it should be solemnly stated that the 'Tercero,' which was sunk by a German submarine, did indeed display its national emblem and had other markings indicating its nationality."

### Arabia: Past and Present (2)

Through the Five Dynasties and up to the Song Dynasty, it never stopped. The Song Dynasty's management of maritime trade was somewhat related to trade with Arabs. The Yuan Dynasty replaced the Zhao Song Dynasty and had the Central Plains, and further encouraged trade with Arabs. The busiest port for ships entering and exiting was Quanzhou, not Guangzhou. This may have been due to Pu Shougeng's management, or it may have been due to Quanzhou's geographical location.

Many Arabs who came to China lived with Chinese people, or even adopted Chinese surnames. Their lifestyle was also greatly influenced by Chinese customs. However, they still strictly adhered to Islam. Sometimes they gathered in fixed places, which were called Fanfang, which were quite similar to the concessions in recent times. The Song Dynasty treated foreign guests (i.e., Arabs) very well. In cases involving private law, they were often allowed to be handled according to Arab law, which was similar to the consular jurisdiction of recent times.

During the Song and Yuan dynasties, the Arabs in various ports were generally very wealthy and lived a very luxurious lifestyle. Corrupt local officials often sought assistance from Arabs, and the Arabs used this to collude with government officials and show off their flattery skills. Pu Shougeng, mentioned above, is a representative of this. Many Arabs married Han women and studied Chinese. Some even took the Chinese imperial examinations, obtained fame, and became Chinese officials. All of this can be verified by historical records.

During the Song and Yuan dynasties, maritime transportation in the south used sailing ships. Some of these sailing ships belonged to Arabs, and some belonged to Chinese. It took about two years to travel back and forth from Arabia to China. Generally, ships came from the Arabian Sea to China in late April to May, during the Indian Ocean monsoon season. Ships returned from China to Arabia from late October to December, during the Northeast trade wind season in the Northern Hemisphere. The busiest time for Arabs doing business in various ports along the Chinese coast was from June to October.

Some Arabs who came to China to do business returned home every year, while others stayed in China for a long time. During transactions, there was usually a translator, called Tangpa. But Arabs who lived in China for a long time could speak and write Chinese.

The Arabs' relationship with Western culture was even closer. Chinese silk, gunpowder, compasses, papermaking, and various other items were all transmitted by the Arabs. This is a fixed saying recognized by historians. In fact, the Arabs' benefits to Europeans were not limited to these material things. The most important thing was the Arabs' attitude and method towards scholarship. They were not as influenced by dogmatic theology as Europeans in the Middle Ages, so they were able to pay attention to the intellectual achievements of the ancient Greeks. They preserved and translated the works of the Greeks, which made it much easier for the masters of the European Renaissance to collect and read Greek classics. We can say that the Arabs were the vanguard of the European Renaissance. Later, the European university system and library system were also first demonstrated by the Arabs. The University of Cairo in Egypt today, as well as the library of Alexandria, are still the scale opened by the Arabs. Another point closely related to the European Renaissance is the introduction of printing. This is a key to opening the treasury of knowledge, and Europeans cannot but be grateful to the Arabs.

The Arabs not only influenced Europeans with their intellectual achievements, but they also established a progressive culture on the European continent in a concrete way. They were ahead of the Europeans. Their successors, the Spaniards today, cannot even reach them. It was they who established the Islamic state centered on Cordoba on the Iberian Peninsula. The ethnic composition of this Islamic country was mostly Moors from North Africa, but there were also many Arabs. In the eighth and ninth centuries, they indeed made Spain blossom with a brilliant civilization. Agricultural methods and crop seeds were greatly improved. In industry, they manufactured metal hardware, swords, spun cloth, manufactured glass, manufactured leather, and manufactured paper. They promoted the postal service, expanded commerce, and also greatly developed art and education. Everything that modern civilized countries have, it had. However, Europeans still deny this civilized elder brother and look down on Arabs.

### Rationing of Grain Progressing Smoothly; Second Phase of Rice and Flour Allocation; Approximately 80,000 Bags of Flour; Price Not Yet Determined; Additional 19,000+ Bags of White Rice Released; Broken Rice Reduced by Half

Yesterday was the second day of the implementation of grain rationing. All 659 rice shops started selling household rice according to regulations from 8 a.m. The procedures were the same as the previous day. Each rice ticket was uniformly for 1.5 liters of white rice and 0.5 liters of broken rice, totaling 2 liters, sold for 5 yuan in rationing coupons. Therefore, the purchase of rice was very good. Residents were able to purchase the prescribed amount of rice from the registered rice shops written on their rice tickets. A Minghua News Agency reporter learned from various rice shops yesterday that the rice tickets received the day before had been pasted on the rice sales report form the previous night and sent to the Food Rice Management Committee offices of the two concessions yesterday for record. The number of rice sold yesterday was to be reported to the authorities by each rice shop today. In the future, the amount of rice sold by each rice shop on the first day must be reported on the next day and may not be neglected.

Second Phase of Rice Allocation Begins Payment

Currently, the Food Rice Management Committee of the two concessions has started the second phase of household rice allocation. For the International Settlement, there are 12,392 bags of white rice, 6,198 bags of broken rice, and 52,049 bags of flour. For the French Concession, there are 6,646 bags of white rice, 3,373 bags of broken rice, and 27,865 bags of flour. The price per bag is set at 309.30 yuan. The market price of flour has not yet been determined by the Price Stabilization Bureau. However, the full amount of the payment must be paid by 12 noon today, and the delivery order will be issued in the afternoon of the same day. At the same time, after the payment is made and the delivery order is obtained, the goods can be delivered from the designated warehouse starting on the 9th and must be delivered by the 11th in order to start the second phase of sales on the 13th.

Quantity and Price Determined Periodically

According to the person in charge of the Food Rice Management Committee yesterday, residents of this city will no longer have to worry about a shortage of daily rice in the future. Although each person can only temporarily purchase 2 liters of household rice per period, the two authorities are still actively trying to find a way to supply the household rice needed by each rice shop on a daily basis, so that they can sell rice for a long time. If it is factually possible, the amount of household rice purchased by citizens may be increased appropriately. On the one hand, the sales price will be determined periodically based on the actual situation.

### Embezzled Over 300,000 Yuan; Private Hoarding; Qiu Yutian Reported; Police Station Strictly Investigating

Qiu Yutian, a 26-year-old man from Anhui, falsely claimed to his friends in April of this year that he had a large amount of white rice in a certain location outside the city. He could find a way to transport it to Shanghai for sale, which would be very profitable. At that time, the plaintiffs, Li Shuangyu and others, believed him and raised over 300,000 yuan, which they gave to him to operate outside the city. However, after Qiu obtained the money, he hoarded other goods and avoided meeting people. After several months, Li and others learned that he was hiding at No. 2, Liang'an Lane, Grolleau Road, in the French Concession and reported it to the police station. The police were instructed to go and arrest him and bring him to the police station for strict investigation.

The total amount before and after these withdrawals will reach the total deposit balance. The withdrawal limit has now been increased to 1,000 yuan per month or 500 yuan per week, which is double the previous amount. It was previously only allowed to withdraw 1,000 yuan per month. At the same time, Citibank is now continuing to pay depositors with four withdrawals. Citibank's four withdrawals began last week and will continue until all depositors have withdrawn. As for the date of the next withdrawal from HSBC, it has not yet been decided, but it will not be far off, as HSBC has sufficient cash to meet all needs. The Agricultural & Commercial Bank is now also paying depositors 500 yuan per week or 2,000 yuan per month. Mr. Hanschmann, the manager of the bank, said that most banks are now doing the same.

### Speculative Businesses Closed: Over a Hundred Companies Shut Down, Commodity Market Prices Calm and Stable, Vegetable Market Price Hikes Under Secret Investigation

Shanghai Times reports: As a result of the authorities' strict measures to crack down on speculation, over a hundred small financial firms engaged in speculative transactions have been forced to close. Currently, there are 183 exchange shops in the concession area and 56 in the Hongkou area permitted to engage in military note trading. Additionally, several dozen more are currently applying to the authorities for permission to operate this business.

Speculation Ceases, Market Calms

It is reported that after the authorities adopted control measures, speculative trading on the local black market has virtually ceased. Activities in markets such as gold and foreign currencies have completely stopped. Only government bonds and Chinese merchant stocks still have some minor trading. Due to banks refusing to provide loans, speculators can no longer continue their activities. As a result, the commodity market has become calm and stable.

Vegetable Price Increases to be Severely Punished

While the authorities are actively stabilizing various commodity prices, some vegetable vendors have dared to raise prices arbitrarily, causing the prices of vegetables, fish, and shrimp to exceed the set limits. Ordinary people are finding this unbearable. The concession authorities, recognizing this, have already dispatched personnel to conduct a secret investigation and have decided to impose severe punishments to alleviate the people's suffering. It is reported that the local South Goods Merchants Association, in order to comply with the authorities' intention to suppress commodity prices, yesterday specifically notified all members through the trade association that they must sell goods at half the original price in new currency as stipulated from May 26th to 28th, so as to avoid arbitrarily raising prices.

### The Chen Huang Family Suicide Case: Police Suggest Joint Suicide Should Avoid Punishment

Chen Huang, a Guangdong woman residing at No. 225 Gan Village, Gan Si Dong Road, French Concession, was accused of theft and reprimanded by her employer last month on the 26th. Due to environmental pressures, she had a desire to end her life. Her eldest son, Guo Zhu, 18 years old, her second daughter, Cui Xia, 15 years old, and her youngest son, Guo Jun, 9 years old, along with herself, burned a coal briquette stove in the attic at night, hoping to suffocate themselves. At 9 a.m. the next morning, when Guo Jun did not arrive at Longmen Elementary School for the exams, a classmate was sent to his home to investigate, and the tragic family scene was discovered. The police were notified and an ambulance was dispatched to the hospital. Only Chen Huang and her daughter were saved, while the two sons died. Subsequently, the police sent Ms. Huang to court to be prosecuted for instigating murder and other crimes, and she was detained pending trial. The details have been reported in the newspapers. This case was brought up again yesterday. The police representative stated that Chen Huang did commit the crime of murder, but according to Article 271, Section 3 of the Criminal Law, attempting joint suicide but committing the crime under Section 1 should exempt her from punishment, and requested a review. After the hearing, the court ordered Chen Huang to be temporarily released into the custody of her brother-in-law, Chen Mo, on bail. The verdict is scheduled to be announced on the 11th.

### British Nationals Evacuating from Shanghai: Negotiations Have Not Reached a Result, If Successful, 1,800 People Will Be Evacuated, Over 8,000 British and Indian Residents in the City

The English-language "Great American Evening News" reports: According to Masaki, the director of the translation department at the Japanese Consulate General in Shanghai, negotiations between the Japanese and British governments, if successful, would result in the repatriation of approximately 1,800 British nationals from Shanghai to Lourenço Marques.

Departure Date

The tentative date is the end of this month. The number of 1,800 is an approximate figure suggested in the negotiations. Two ships will be required to transport this number of nationals. The Japanese ship "Ryuta Maru" has already been designated to transport British nationals from Shanghai. The second ship has not yet been determined, pending the conclusion of negotiations between the two countries through the Swiss government,

Ships for Evacuation

It would be premature to decide. The Nippon Yusen Kaisha's "Kamakura Maru" might be used for this purpose. If the "Kamakura Maru" is retained to transport British nationals evacuating from Japan and Manchuria, other Japanese ships will be utilized. Furthermore, the "Conte Verde" and the Japanese ship "Asama Maru" recently sailed from the Eastern Hemisphere carrying American nationals to Lourenço Marques and will carry Japanese nationals evacuating from the Western Hemisphere back here.

The British Association in this city has registered

All British nationals who wish to evacuate. There are over 8,000 British nationals in Shanghai, including those of Indian descent. In addition, many British nationals from the interior have already arrived in Shanghai. It is expected that more British nationals will continue to arrive in Shanghai. The British Association has found suitable accommodation for these people, many of whom are residing at the Columbia Country Club on Great Western Road.

### Infected Area in Nanshi: May Be Locked Down for a Week, Bodies Not Allowed to Be Moved to Funeral Homes, Coffins Should Be Bought and Bodies Placed Inside Immediately in Hospitals

The true cholera has been discovered in this city, and as many as eight people have been infected, posing a threat to the health of the city's residents this summer. The Datong News Agency reporter records the continuing situation as follows:

Infected Areas May Be Locked Down

Eight cases of true cholera have been discovered in the Shanghai Epidemic Hospital on Qiaqing Road. The infected areas are all located in the Huining Road area of Nanshi. Therefore, this area may be subject to a one-week epidemic prevention lockdown to carry out disinfection and isolation work to eliminate the spread of germs.

Vaccinations Should Be Administered to Avoid Infection

According to a Datong News Agency reporter's inquiry, if a case of true cholera occurs in a household in the two concessions, the house must be disinfected and sealed off for a week for isolation purposes. Therefore, every resident should quickly get a vaccination to avoid infection and to avoid the inconvenience of having their home sealed off. Do not delay.

Buy Coffins and Collect Bodies Inside Hospitals

Those who die from true cholera after ineffective treatment must have their bodies placed in coffins purchased inside the hospital. They must not be moved to funeral homes to prevent the spread of cholera germs through corpses. Therefore, all epidemic hospitals are following this procedure.

### Yesterday Continued with Heat Waves, Temperature 91 Degrees, Over 400 Cases of Epidemic

The weather in this city was extremely hot again yesterday. According to a Datong News Agency reporter, the highest temperature yesterday rose to 91 degrees Fahrenheit (33 degrees Celsius). Because the wind was calm, the heat was even more intense. As a result, epidemic patients increased sharply. According to records from the Shanghai Epidemic Hospital on Qiaqing Road, there were more than 400 outpatients yesterday. All 400 beds in the hospital were also occupied by inpatients.

### Central Hotel Detains a Large Number of Extortionists

### Repatriation Certificates: No Issuance in the Afternoon

According to inquiries made by the reporter at the issuance office for repatriation permits in the Public Works Department Building on Jiangxi Road, the office has resumed issuing permits this morning since it stopped working on the 1st of this month.

### Private Smuggling of Opium Seized: Both Parties Arrested

Chen Xinggui, Bu Chaoke, Wu Zhiliang, and Xu Shunxiang from Anhui, who are opium traffickers, recently brought 21 taels of opium worth over 2,000 yuan from Wuhu to Shanghai. At 10:40 AM on the morning of the 19th of last month, while passing near Feilun Road outside the Hongkou Bridge, they were seen by Zhu Jinmao from Hai'ning, who pretended to be an investigator from a certain organization and tried to extort money from them. They argued with each other. Fang Fucheng, a detective from the police station, investigated and learned the details. He took the opium and the people involved to the police station. The lawyer representing the legal department prosecuted them for both transporting and robbing opium and demanded that the five defendants be punished. When questioned, Chen Xinggui and the other three admitted to transporting the opium to Shanghai to sell for profit. They each offered to pay 200 yuan to be leniently treated. Zhu Jinmao, the opium robber, gave inconsistent statements. The verdict is scheduled to be announced on the 10th of this month.

### The Guild of Boiled Water Shops Encourages Members to Continue Setting Up Tea Pavilions, Authorities Promise to Find a Solution to the Coal Problem

The Boiled Water Shop Guild of this city has, in the past year, supervised all member shops to set up tea pavilions on important streets, with remarkable results, benefiting ordinary people and street wanderers.

### Recent News on Leprosy Society Fundraising

The China Leprosy Relief Association's fundraising campaign has been going on for three weeks since its opening, and has received about 70,000 yuan. In addition to Nanji's 5,000 yuan donation, there are many donations of 1,000 yuan and 500 yuan. However, there are only eight days left in the association's fundraising deadline, and it is still short of more than half of the original target. In order to maintain leprosy hospitals across the country and in Shanghai, the association needs at least 150,000 yuan to support the existing work. It is hoped that people from all walks of life will enthusiastically contribute to make this cause a success.

### Jewish Refugee Committee Severes Ties with American Headquarters, Funding Sources Face Serious Difficulties

Ms. Margaret, the chairman of the Jewish Refugee Relief Committee in this city, revealed yesterday that the committee had received a telegram from Washington stating that the American Headquarters will sever ties with the Shanghai Committee from now on. As a result, tens of thousands of Jewish refugees currently residing in Shanghai will lose economic support, especially the elderly and young, and food assistance will face an unprecedented and serious panic from the end of this month. It is reported that European Jewish refugees in this city have encountered great difficulties in assistance since the second half of last year. After the outbreak of the Pacific War, with the permission of the Japanese authorities, they borrowed a sum of money from neutral parties in this city for six months, because the American Headquarters telegraphed allowing the Shanghai Committee to borrow money from outside for six months and repay it after the war. Now that six months have passed, the American Headquarters has stopped providing assistance, so the situation is serious. All refugee camps may be closed by the end of the month. There were many refugees in the past, but after the war, half of them were gone, and only young children and the elderly remain. If they are disbanded, it will be difficult for them to survive. Currently, the Shanghai Committee is trying to solve their livelihood problems. The cost for each refugee per month is 50 Chu banknotes.

After Zhan reported to the French police, detectives went to investigate, but they returned to report to the police chief that there was no progress.

### This Newspaper's Student Aid Fund: Preparations for Application to Begin, Tuition Increases Several Times, Aid Money Insufficient, Striving to Proceed Under Difficult Circumstances, Hoping All Sectors Donate as Much as Possible to Accomplish the Task

Since the promotion of the third session of this newspaper's student aid fund, it has been deeply appreciated by readers who have generously donated. Various schools have sent letters donating free tuition slots. The material and spiritual assistance given by all parties has made the colleagues of this newspaper more aware of their responsibilities. Now that the time is approaching to start accepting applications, we would like to sincerely reiterate the details of the operation of this session's student aid fund to all sectors.

School Tuition Fees Increase Sharply

The most difficult part of this session's student aid fund is the economic constraint. Although the total amount of donations has now exceeded 40,000 Chu banknotes, which is not less than previous sessions, the tuition fees of schools at all levels have increased sharply in the coming semester. According to an on-site investigation by this newspaper's reporter, primary schools average about 80 to 90 yuan, junior high schools average about 140 to 150 yuan, senior high schools average about 180 to 190 yuan, and universities average about 240 to 250 yuan, all collected in Chu banknotes. The amount of increase is no less than five to six times compared to the previous semester. Therefore, in terms of the number of students who can be assisted, if 1,000 people could be assisted in the previous session, this session can only afford 200 people based on the current aid money received. Furthermore, as the cost of living increases, the number of impoverished students applying for aid will be several times higher than in the past, while the estimated number of those who can receive aid will be several times less than the previous session. All of these actual situations should be understood by enthusiastic people from all walks of life, without the need for further explanation. We only hope that enthusiastic people will keep the welfare of impoverished students in mind and continuously provide assistance, so that the students' studies will not be interrupted as a result.

Welcome Donations for Tuition Slots

In recent days, many schools have sent letters donating free tuition slots, demonstrating enthusiasm and jointly participating in this charitable act. We are very grateful. We have recorded them separately and will publish the school names after compiling them. In the future, we will send letters to recommend outstanding impoverished students to enroll. However, summer tutoring schools, due to the application deadline not yet arriving and the time required for screening, investigation, and review, cannot be guaranteed to be sent, so we are sorry for the generous offer of summer tutoring slots donated by various schools. Due to the limitations of the facts, we hope for understanding. As for the donation of free tuition slots in universities, middle schools, and tutoring schools, we will solemnly recommend students in accordance with the procedures.

The Charitable Actions of Mr. Zhang and Mr. Zhou

This newspaper received a letter from Mr. Zhang Jingcheng yesterday, which said, "Dear Sirs, I am hereby submitting 410 Chu banknotes and pray that they be used for the student aid fund. A small amount, but a slight effort. May your newspaper call on the society even more, give great sympathy to the students, save unnecessary waste, and fulfill the ambitions of young students with a wave of the hand, so as to fulfill one's due obligation to society. Then the youth will be fortunate. Respectfully, Zhang Jingcheng." Mr. Zhou Zhifeng, to thank friends for their birthday wishes, saved money on banquets and donated 300 yuan to student aid, creating blessings for relatives and friends. The enthusiastic charitable actions of the two gentlemen are worthy of emulation. Yesterday, the aid money received included 410 yuan from Zhang Jingcheng, 300 yuan from Zhou Zhifeng, 250 yuan from Longji, 178.68 yuan from the rewards of all the initiators of the National Publishing Co., Ltd., 50 yuan from Xu Aitang, and 10 yuan from Wang Jinfang, totaling 1,198.68 Chu banknotes. Adding the previous balance of 42,444.76 yuan, the total balance is 43,642.44 yuan.

### Sanletang Scholarship for Students: Twenty Students to be Selected This Term

In view of the difficult times, we have specially saved on expenses and accumulated some funds to reward and assist hardworking students and pay their tuition fees. The following are the provisional rules:
   Students who are currently (or newly entering) middle school and whose families are indeed in financial difficulty and unable to pay tuition fees should state the true situation in writing for investigation.
   Those whose academic performance and conduct in the previous semester were rated B or above should submit school certificates for review.
   Applicants for the scholarship should provide a detailed description of their personal resume and family situation in the application, along with school certificates and personal photos, and mail them to "Qi Residence, No. 1, Lane 479, Kangti Road (opposite the post office)" for collection.
   The deadline for receiving applications is from July 15th to 30th.
   After preliminary investigation and review, a notice will be sent for a scheduled examination (written or oral).
   The number of scholarships is tentatively set at 20 for this term. After the selection, a notice will be sent to submit the school's payment slip for payment of tuition fees.

### Organizing an Old Book Exchange

Recently, due to the high price of paper and the lack of teaching materials, Wang Gongwei and several university students have jointly invested in the organization of the Five-Star Old Book Exchange, which is large in scale and widely collects books. This organization is indeed newly established, and its future development has unlimited hope. Its business is mainly exchange, and consignment sales and consignment purchases are secondary. If students have used textbooks that they want to exchange for the current semester, the society can assess the price and exchange them. Or, if there are books that are not suitable and you want to transfer them, you can set a reasonable price and entrust the society for consignment sales. If you want to purchase teaching materials or reference textbooks, you can go to the society to choose them. Otherwise, you can specify the publisher and book name, and the society can purchase them on your behalf. The price is lower than the market price. All colleagues are purely serving the student community faithfully, and the fees charged are about 10%. The address of the society is temporarily located at No. 102, Lane 370, Xiaoshadu Road (intersection of Wuding Road), inside Jiande Elementary and Middle School. Brochures are available upon request.

### A Small Town on the Sujia Road: A Major Sheng Spinning Production Area, Summer Cloth and Kao Silk are in Short Supply, Only Sheng Spinning is Unique, Full Factory Silk Electric Spinning is the Best

For summer clothing materials, lightness and coolness are the top priorities. Therefore, Jiangxi summer cloth, Guangdong Kao silk, and Sheng spinning have become the favorites of summer clothing materials. However, since the war, the source of Jiangxi summer cloth has been cut off, and Guangdong Kao silk has also become almost extinct due to being under control. According to merchants who deal in these goods in Shanghai, almost all of the summer cloth and Kao silk in the Shanghai market are inventory. Only Sheng spinning is still being shipped from the production area to Shanghai. Now let's talk about Sheng spinning for consumers' reference.

Shengze Specialty

Sheng spinning is the abbreviation of Shengze silk spinning. Shengze is a small town belonging to Wujiang County, Jiangsu Province, and is a relatively important station on the Sujia Railway. The entire town has a population of about 30,000 to 40,000. The town area is not large, but it is unusually prosperous and lively because it is a silk industry area. It is known as Little Shanghai and is the leader among the towns in Wujiang County. Wherever the flames of war have reached, the tragic scene is inevitable. Shengze has not suffered much from the fires of war, but it is enough for people to see the traces of war. Fortunately, the town is a silk industry area, so the bleak scene is still lighter than in other towns.

Handicrafts

Sheng spinning was originally a handmade product. Almost everyone in Shengze knows how to use a spinning machine. The weaving machines used are old-fashioned wooden machines, but in recent years, some have used electricity. The so-called electric spinning refers to the silk spun by electricity. The silk used for spinning has factory silk and native silk. Factory silk is cleaner than native silk, so full factory silk electric spinning is the best among Sheng spinning, followed by native silk electric spinning. In addition, there is Guang Kou spinning. Guang Kou spinning includes pure white, striped, and checkered patterns, and even foreign spinning, which is the worst among Sheng spinning. Recently, because factory native silk electric spinning is expensive, some people even use foreign spinning after processing to impersonate and sell it. However, such a practice is despised by the Shengze natives, because it would damage the brand. Most of the time, it is the trick of amateur non-local merchants.

Real Silk Raw Materials

Sheng spinning originally only had a pure white color. Jacquard and checkered patterns are later developments. There was a time when artificial silk was mixed with silk, or foreign thread was mixed with the weft. Recently, foreign thread is expensive and artificial silk is also in short supply. Therefore, Sheng spinning is as it used to be, with every strand being real silk. The advantage of Sheng spinning is that it is light and thin, and the price is cheaper than products from other regions. Every summer, Sheng spinning becomes active in the Shanghai market. Men use it to make underwear or suit shirts, women use it to make cheongsams or underwear, and foreign spinning is most suitable for lining robes and silk cotton clothes. Because Sheng spinning is a handmade product, the products cannot reach standardization. Although the length and width vary little, this gives people an excuse, and it is often difficult during transportation, which inevitably increases a lot of consumption for silk merchants. Generally, each bolt of Sheng spinning is about two feet wide and about 18 yards long, which is 45 feet. Each bolt of Sheng spinning can be used to make about six or seven men's suit shirts, more than three sets of men's shorts, and the remaining silk can be used to make a woman's cheongsam. The shirts that are popular this year, such as small checkered and striped patterns, are mostly made of Sheng spinning.

Current Market Price

The best pure factory silk electric spinning among Sheng spinning was only a few dozen yuan per bolt before the war. The price has increased day by day after the war, and its price is even more expensive today. In early May of this year, full factory silk electric spinning was only 300 yuan per bolt in legal currency, native silk was only 270 to 280 yuan, checkered Guang Kou spinning was 260 to 270 yuan per bolt, and striped was about 240 yuan. By the end of May, the price jumped, increasing by one-half of the original price. After switching to Chu banknotes, the price has increased even more than the old price, that is, the price at this time is more than double that of early May. The reason why Sheng spinning is becoming more expensive is all due to the soaring price of silk. For example, Wuxi factory silk has always been the raw material for Sheng spinning, and now the price of factory silk is soaring, and the cost of Sheng silk is increasing day by day. Its price must also rise linearly. In addition, the cost of living in the interior is increasing day by day, and the wages are expensive, so the silk weaving workers and silk merchants are not willing to sell at low prices. Although Sheng spinning is becoming more expensive day by day, it is still cheap compared to silk goods from other places. Compared with the skyrocketing price of cloth and foreign house silk, the situation of Sheng silk is not too excessive.

The same is true for each bolt of Sheng spinning, but the quality is quite different. Some are fine and clean, while others are rough and uneven. The price will inevitably follow with high and low. Generally, the goods made by Shengze merchants are carefully selected. Even if there are rough and dark goods, they will be stated in advance, and they will never voluntarily damage the brand. (Gan)

### Sudden Large-Scale Release of Public Bonds; Each Falls Around One Yuan

In the gray market for public bonds, yesterday's market initially remained stable. However, a large number of bonds were suddenly released, causing prices to fall. This further dampened confidence. Previously, the bulls were confident because prices mostly rose with few declines, so they rarely sold. Since the recent volatility, the bulls have become less secure. This is just a partial fluctuation, and not necessarily indicative of a general rise or fall. The cracks have not yet become obvious, and it is hoped that the bulls will work hard to save the situation, which is still quite manageable. Yesterday, because of companies like Yi Li, Wu He, and Heng Yu, bulls released large quantities. Reportedly, a large portion of these sales represent small financial institutions liquidating their positions, also indicating a lack of confidence. As a result, prices uniformly continued to fall by seven or eight cents to one yuan and forty cents, with transactions of about one million two hundred to thirty thousand yuan. A summary table is provided below.

### Strong Buying Interest in Chinese Stocks

Yesterday's market for Chinese merchant stocks remained strong. Shanghai Cotton Textiles rose by as much as twenty-four yuan. New Pharmaceuticals also stopped falling and turned upwards. Cultural and financial stocks were also steady. Transactions were brisk. Detailed price tables for each market are listed below.

### Cloth Market Remains Stagnant

Yesterday's cloth market did not escape the trend of stagnation. Confidence was relatively stable. New orders for twelve-pound "Dragon Head" fine cloth opened at one hundred and ninety yuan and closed at two hundred and two yuan. "Four Gentlemen" serge fluctuated around seven yuan and seventy or eighty cents. There were few transactions in factory cloth, and prices did not change much. Sixteen-pound "Globe" coarse cloth was currently quoted at one hundred and eighty-nine yuan, and "Flying Swan" at one hundred and eighty-five yuan. Twelve-pound "Globe" fine cloth was one hundred and seventy-three yuan and fifty cents. There were occasional transactions. Due to seasonal factors, printed fabrics saw even fewer transactions. "Jasper Scholar's Gown" poplin was quoted at six yuan and five cents, "Volleyball" yarn poplin at three yuan and seventy cents, "Three Sheep" serge at six yuan and thirty-five cents. New orders for "Peach Blossom" women's fabric opened at two yuan and seventy-six cents, reached a high of two yuan and eighty-three cents, and closed at two yuan and eighty-two and a half cents, it was said.

### Difficult Situation for Retailers of Woolen Fabrics

Since the authorities implemented price controls, retailers of woolen fabrics have successively lowered their posted prices. Because the symptom was treated instead of the root cause, the wholesale prices on the market remain firm, exceeding retail prices. The prices quoted by the factories are even higher than the wholesale prices on the market. According to the factories, the new cost of production makes higher prices inevitable, and the lack of raw materials suggests an impending shortage. This is because water and electricity rates have increased by two-thirds since the old currency was changed to the new currency, workers' food expenses continue to rise, salaries have more than doubled from the old to the new currency, and prices of wool and cotton raw materials are high and scarce. All these facts demonstrate that everything is going in the opposite direction.

### Strict Enforcement of Two-to-One Exchange Rate; Grain Merchants Fearful; Beneficial to the Public

Yesterday, the market for miscellaneous grains suddenly turned quiet, because the authorities of the French Concession issued an order through the association, informing fellow merchants that they should sell at a rate of two-to-one, converting to Central Reserve Bank notes based on the prices from May 26th to 28th of this year, and must not exceed this rate. Otherwise, once discovered, they would be severely punished without leniency. Therefore, everyone was apprehensive, and both supply and demand were lacking. Only Sheng Ji bean cakes were traded, five hundred pieces of old stock from an unspecified month at fifty-two yuan, and five hundred pieces of new stock from April at fifty-eight yuan. However, the source has not yet been unblocked, and the underlying trend remains strong.

### Sugar Rationing for June and July Combined

It is heard that the sugar rations for retailers for last month and this month have been decided to be combined, with a total of 35,000 bags, and purchase certificate number 10 can be issued. Yesterday, the sugar stocks of the cooperative business office saw light trading and continued to weaken slightly, with coarse granulated sugar at three hundred and nineteen and a half yuan, down one yuan. There were no transactions in red granulated sugar stocks.

### Jellyfish Head and Skin Are Expensive

Jellyfish heads and skins produced in Ningbo have become increasingly scarce recently, and inventories are low. However, the sales channels are quite active, so prices continue to rise. Currently, the market price for jellyfish heads is one hundred and sixty yuan, up by one-fourth, and for jellyfish skin, two hundred and fifty yuan, up by one-fifth. The market is generally stable.

### Fresh Daylily from Xuzhou Rises

New daylily from the Xuzhou producing area has begun to appear sporadically. Because Shanghai still has inventories and buyers are unwilling to pay high prices, most have no intention of rushing to buy. It is heard that buyers from Nanjing, with their stocks depleted, have been purchasing from there, causing prices in the producing area to tighten instead of loosen, with prices having already increased by ten yuan in national currency, showing signs of further tightening.

### Cigarettes in Decline

Cigarette selling prices continue to weaken. Due to weather conditions, the number of customers visiting the street has decreased slightly, and many scattered sellers are releasing their stocks, creating a situation of more supply than demand. Yesterday's transactions included "Great Britain" brand at eight thousand eight hundred yuan, "Old Knife" brand at five thousand seven hundred and fifty yuan, "Pinhai" brand at four thousand eight hundred yuan, "Wuhua" brand at three thousand eight hundred and fifty yuan, "Fairy" brand at three thousand seven hundred yuan, fifty-stick "Great Front Gate" at two thousand three hundred yuan per carton, ten-stick "Great Front Gate" at two thousand three hundred and fifty yuan, twenty-stick "Great Front Gate" at two thousand four hundred yuan, Japanese cigarette "Golden Gun" brand at one thousand three hundred and fifty yuan, "Golden Building" brand at two thousand and twenty yuan, "Red Rose" brand at one thousand one hundred and fifty yuan, "Quanlu" brand at one thousand seven hundred and fifty yuan, "Guide" brand at one thousand two hundred and seventy yuan, national cigarette "Golden Mouse" brand at one thousand and seventy yuan, "Beautiful" brand at three thousand and fifty yuan, and "Pyramid" at two thousand nine hundred yuan, all slightly lower than the previous day. The "Golden Gun" brand saw brisk trading yesterday, while few other brands were traded, and the overall momentum was in decline.

### Daily Necessities Market Continues Downward Trend

The market for daily necessities is showing a downward trend because the price of cigarettes continues to weaken slightly, inevitably softening confidence. Trades included "Phoenix" brand at three thousand one hundred yuan, "Beautiful" brand at three thousand two hundred yuan, miscellaneous brands at two thousand two hundred yuan, "Guben" soap at three hundred and thirty yuan, "Bai Xiangmao" soap at two hundred and forty-five yuan, "Arrow Knife" soap at two hundred and sixty yuan, "Huang Xiangmao" at two hundred and ten yuan, "White Rice" brand candles at one hundred and twenty yuan, and "Monk's Hat" brand at one hundred and fifteen yuan, with only slight differences from the previous day.

### Abalone Shells Remain Firm and Expensive

Abalone shells, also known as Shi Jue Ming, have been in short supply for a long time, and market inventories are very low. Therefore, selling prices have not weakened, but have instead tightened. Yesterday, the market price was five hundred yuan per dan [unit of weight], whereas normally it is only several tens of yuan. The difference between now and then cannot be measured in common terms.

### Pangolin Scales Remain Firm

Pangolin scales have been in short supply for a long time, and market inventories are extremely low. Therefore, prices are quite high and have remained so for a long time. Yesterday, the market price for clean pangolin scales was five thousand yuan. Pangolin skin is out of stock and the trend is firm.

### To Promote Kunqu Opera, It Is Necessary to Cultivate Flute Players First

— Owner of Sixin Pavilion

Musical composition is used to harmonize the body and mind. Southern tunes are relaxed, with gentle phrases and melodies. Northern tunes are heroic, inspiring, and energetic, representing the sounds of harmony and refinement during prosperous times. Therefore, it flourishes when order is restored from chaos and declines when order gives way to chaos. In the past three to five years, the sounds of songs in Shanghai have been diverse and jumbled, with a decline in positive energy. If one wants to listen to clear and fluent music, one can only seek it in Kunqu opera. However, the famous Kunqu performers have already separated, leaving a fragmented situation. Zhu Chuanming pairs with Yu Zhenfei, Zhang Chuanfang mostly teaches female amateurs, Zheng Chuanjian trains students at a drama school, and Wang Chuansong switches to the Suzhou opera path, while flute players are like lonely stars after dawn, with no new ones emerging. However, Shanghai Beijing opera amateurs strive for improvement, meticulously studying stage movements and tracing back to the majestic steps of Kunqu opera. In plays such as "Selling the Horse" and "Lin Chong Flees at Night," a good flute is indispensable, otherwise, they would be less impressive. "Drunken Concubine" has a leisurely melody, and storytelling gains a desolate tone, both thanks to the accompaniment of the flute. However, the fee for a flute player is meager, earning only two or three yuan per day, which is not enough to sustain a livelihood. No wonder they switch to other professions, leading to the decline of this art. Recently, according to my knowledge, the only flute players left are Li Yaxiong, Shen Sanming, Jin Shousheng, Zhu Shuijing, and Jiang Gengsheng. Li has a fondness for indulgence, and his spirit is not good. Jin and Shen have the best flute styles and know many operas. Shen needs rest and recuperation and is reluctant to play for anyone except old friends of more than five years. Zhu and Jiang play in fewer operas, but they are diligent and tireless, supporting various troupes and barely keeping them alive. My friend Mr. Chu said that a Beijing opera rehearsal of "Selling the Horse" cost over three hundred gold yuan on stage. Kunqu opera amateurs advocate thrift, cultivate virtue, and are humble and respectful. However, cultivating flute players is especially urgent. A proactive approach would be to urge various music societies and amateur troupes to recruit young children, four to six per troupe, to learn the flute daily. They should strive for accuracy in learning specific melodies and tunes, with monthly tests to assess performance and determine rewards and punishments. Secondly, select female children as flute students, combining singing and learning stage movements, with a fixed number of hours per week. They can still pursue other occupations, so that economic resources and time are not wasted. On Sundays, select morally upright stories from opera scripts and invite troupe members to lecture voluntarily, first instilling the essence of the opera to achieve gradual progress. Pingsheng, Gengchun, and Xiaoshe societies each have writers and musicians who can help each other. If one can guide and encourage them in this way, achievements will be made within a year. This is a general outline, and I hope enthusiasts will improve and promote it.

### Monkey Opera Master Hao Zhenji Passes Away

— Owner of Meihua Pavilion

Hao Zhenji, a master of monkey opera in the Northern Kunqu troupe, enjoyed a long-standing reputation in the Beijing-Tianjin area. In recent years, due to his advanced age, he retired to his home and was unwilling to showcase his extraordinary skills. Recently, Bai Yunsheng, a famous young Kunqu opera actor, organized a Kunqu opera festival in Tianjin and originally planned to invite Hao to join the joint performance and even announced it in posters. However, Hao did not appear on stage on the opening day of the Kunqu opera festival. The general audience suspected that it was a trick played by Bai, simply creating publicity to attract attention. However, the sad news came that Hao had passed away suddenly at the end of last month (died at his residence in Ya Hongqiao, Yutian County). A master of his generation passed away with his skills, and another hero of the older generation has weakened. This is not only a misfortune for the Kunqu troupe but also a great loss for the opera world.

### Readers' Opinions on Movie Theaters Discontinuing Program Guides

— Hui Ying

"Since the announcement that Chinese films will discontinue issuing program guides from July 1st, the general movie fans inevitably feel disappointed. I would like to suggest two compromise solutions:

Whenever a new film is released, the theater or film company can issue a special publication about the new film, which audiences can purchase if they wish to read it.

Before the release of a new film, an advertisement summarizing the story can be published in Shen Bao and Xin Bao newspapers. This is also a solution when there are no other options. (Xing Meng)

When a certain new film is about to be released, the summary of the film can be published in the supplement of the newspaper.

The summary of the film can be handwritten and posted in the places where photos are displayed in each theater. The summary does not need to be long, but it should be concise and well-organized. (Zheng Xiangling)

Before the show starts, the theater authorities can use slides to show the audience a very brief summary of the story."

### Anecdotes about Suzhou Storytelling

— Feng

In the past, there were the "Four Great Vajras" in the world of Suzhou storytelling: Ma, Zhao, Yao, and Wang. Ma Rufei was famous for "The Pearl Pagoda," Zhao Xiangzhou was famous for "Drawing a Golden Phoenix," Yao Shizhang was famous for "Water Margin," and Wang Shiquan was famous for "Records of Retribution." There were also the so-called "Big Three Sacrifices," which were Zhu Yaoting and Yao Sheng's "Double Phoenixes," Yang Yuecuo and Xingcuo's "The Pearl Pagoda," and Wu Biquan and Xigeng's "The Tale of the White Snake." Because these three stories each had their own unique flavor and expressiveness, and "Zhu Yang Wu" sounds like "Pig, Sheep, Fish" in Chinese, they were named "Big Three Sacrifices."

Two years ago, someone established a "New Medical Specialization Training Class" at Zhonghua Vocational Supplementary School, recruiting junior high school students and providing two semesters of training with evening classes. The teachers were Fan Yanqiao, Lu Dan'an, Xu Zhuodai, etc. The stated purpose was: "To establish a unique style in the art of storytelling, to have appropriate value in literature, to have unique skills in the profession, not to discuss politics, not to involve obscure topics, and not to be obscene." However, no news about this specialization training class has been heard since then. Perhaps it has been discontinued due to various difficulties. The storytelling profession has a close relationship with social education. The current "Suzhou Storytelling" and "Pinghua Storytelling" both need to be improved. Therefore, it is unknown whether this type of specialization training class can be revived.

### Chatting About Tyrone Power

— Tao Shunsheng

The handsome young Tyrone Power was born on May 5th in Ohio, USA. When he graduated from high school, he performed in a play called "Officer Number 666." In this play, his acting skills were praised by his father, who personally trained him. His father was originally famous for performing Shakespearean plays. Soon, Tyrone Power played the old man in "The Merchant of Venice" in Chicago. After two years of hard work, he finally gained the attention of Hollywood and began working as a movie actor. In "Jesse James," he played a fearless robber, with a "bandit's accent" that gave the audience a new impression. His calm, serious, and admirable expression was like a brave and tender hero from Liangshan Mountain.

In "The Mark of Zorro," we saw his swordsmanship for the first time; in the recently released "Blood and Sand," we further appreciated his bullfighting skills. He is truly a versatile actor. From his works, we can see that he was so ordinary the year before the filming of "In Old Chicago," but after "In Old Chicago," he not only jumped to the throne of the silver screen but also became the idol of women around the world. Later, he starred with Norma Shearer in "Marie Antoinette," with Alice Faye and Don Ameche in "Alexander's Ragtime Band," and with Anna Bella and Loretta Young in "Suez," all of which were excellent. From then on, he enjoyed unprecedented fame.

The gentle and elegant Tyrone Power is so serious about his work, and his acting skills are improving day by day. I believe that people who work hard will have a bright future. Tyrone Power is promising.

There also seems to be a beautiful young actor in Shanghai, who is praised as the "Oriental Tyrone Power." Unfortunately, he does not express his beauty well, nor does he reveal his talent in his work, which is a bit disappointing to the public.

### Unique Skills of Old Opera Performers

— Wu Yin

Chinese people have a selfish mentality and are unwilling to pass on their most proficient skills to others. Many old opera performers have this habit, so many unique skills can no longer be seen on stage, which is truly regrettable.

When Lao Tan sang Song Jiang in "Wulongyuan," when Yan Xijiao forced him to write a divorce letter, the square scarf on his head would stand straight up, truly "hair standing on end in anger." Wang Yaoqing's "Changbanpo," when Lady Mi took off her clothes and threw herself into the well, was swift and clean, leaving no trace. Chen Xicai, playing Wang Ying in "Hujiazhuang," could fight with Hu Sanniang in a crouching position. Xiao Cuihua's drunken performance was unmatched. Chen Delin's slipping steps in "Yubei Pavilion" were divine. Zhu Suyun's crying in "Yuejiazhuang" was like the innocence of a child. Shang Heyu could spin the hammer freely in his hand in "Siping Mountain." When Yang Xiaolou's Jiang Wei carried his bow and retreated in "Iron Cage Mountain," he lowered his head and turned around, causing his hair and long sideburns to separate to the left and right, which was extremely beautiful. Yu Shuyan could kick his shoes up and let them fall gently on his head in "Wen Qiao Makes Trouble at the Government Office." In addition, the facial makeup of Huang Runfu and Qian Jinfu, and the movements of Zhu Guafang and Jiuzhenfeng, were all at the peak of perfection, and no one among the current performers can compare.

There are many reasons why Chinese old opera cannot progress, but this selfish mentality is undoubtedly a very important reason. It is hoped that performers with a broad vision will eliminate this kind of bad mentality and try to pass on their skills to future generations. Otherwise, the future of old opera will inevitably gradually decline into a dangerous state of destruction.

### The Origin of the Opera "Evil Tiger Village"

— Zhong Tang

The opera "Evil Tiger Village" is a story from the late Qing Dynasty, during the Daoguang and Xianfeng periods. The entire opera is based on the essence of the story of Huang Tianba, Pu Tianpeng, and Wu Tianqiu from the "Shi Gong An" cases, about their breaking of their sworn brotherhood. This is a legitimate opera for martial actors. Anyone who has seen this opera knows the plot well. However, few people know who was behind the initial arrangement and the reason why this opera was created. Here, I will briefly describe what I know for reference.

During the Daoguang and Xianfeng periods of the late Qing Dynasty, there was a martial actor named Shen Xiaoqing, who was part of the Chunhao Beijing Opera Troupe and enjoyed a good reputation. He was also a talented playwright. He had a close relationship with Jin Laojiao, an official of the Qing court's Ministry of Justice. One day, Jin and Shen were strolling leisurely when they suddenly saw a beautiful young woman standing at an alleyway, looking romantic. She sent seductive glances with her eyes, and Jin was tempted to flirt with her, but Xiaoqing stopped him, scolding him for being indecent. When the sun set, they each returned home. Since then, Jin had repeatedly searched for her踪跡, but all in vain, causing him to get angry with Shen and think of ways to take revenge to vent his anger. One day, Xiaoqing fell ill, and Jin encouraged him to take opium, which cured his illness. When he fell ill a second time, Jin used the same method to encourage him to take opium, while secretly reporting him to the authorities, and he was imprisoned. At this time, Jin's anger was relieved. When Shen learned of Jin's conspiracy in prison, he felt depressed and wanted to write a play to accuse Jin. After carefully considering the story of Huang Tianba, Pu Tianpeng, and Wu Tianqiu in the "Shi Gong An" cases, who were also sworn brothers, but later became enemies due to different ambitions, leading to the breaking of their sworn brotherhood, Pu Tianpeng and Wu Tianqiu harmed Tianba, which was unkind. However, Tianba's killing of Pu Tianpeng's entire family was even more cruel. Therefore, the entire opera was based on this theme, and "Evil Tiger Village" was created.

### Sharing the Storm

— He Jiawen

Six, a snap of the fingers

Before long, it was time for dinner. According to Mrs. Chen's wishes, the servant was asked to go to the street to buy a catty of good Chen Shao wine. Wei Cheng said, "I dare not. I don't drink alcohol, and even less so during mourning." Mrs. Chen gave up on that. But she also thought that she should borrow a guest from the neighbor's house, because she herself was a woman and was observing the popular June vegetarian diet, and no one could be spared from the family to entertain. Wei Cheng quickly stopped her, saying, "If Auntie does that, it means you don't consider me as a grandson." Wei Cheng blocked Mrs. Chen's suggestion again. He watched the servant bring out the dishes, piling up a table full. Wei Cheng wanted to show that he was not an outsider, and Mrs. Chen wanted him to eat, so he ate. He originally only ate two bowls of rice, but at the Chen's house, he added half a bowl. Mrs. Chen still said that he was being too polite.

After eating, Guoqi and Guofang had not returned. Wei Cheng knew that Mrs. Chen had not eaten yet and said with a smile, "I saw a few books in their brother and sister's room. I'll go flip through them. Auntie, please eat your meal. It's best not to entertain me." Wei Cheng went alone into Guofang's room and saw a soft mat laid on the iron bed, with a pillow and a towel blanket piled at the head of the bed. From this, he knew that the family was indeed waiting for her return. He looked into Guoqi's room, and it was the same arrangement. He randomly took a book from the rattan bookshelf, not looking at the book, and walked to Guofang's bed, intending to sit down but not yet sitting when the servant wrung a towel. He wiped his face and quickly started reading the book. The servant went out, and unconsciously, he sat down. There was an old-fashioned armchair with a backrest and a round stool in front of the bed, but he didn't sit on either of them. It wasn't until he sat down that he realized he was sitting on Guofang's bed. Since he had sat down, so be it. There was no need to overcorrect and say that he shouldn't have sat there. Unexpectedly, the servant came again with a cup of cool tea, which forced him to stand up straight, take the tea from the servant, and quickly sit down, but he sat on the round stool. The round stool was more than an inch lower than the height of the bed. Wei Cheng, using his experience of sitting on the bed to sit on the round stool, was suddenly startled, and some of the tea in the cup spilled on his hand. (123)
