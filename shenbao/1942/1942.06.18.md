Workers who refine potash must wear long leather boots to protect their skin from injury.

### German Troops in Libya Brave Sandstorms to Intensify Encirclement of Tobruk. Armored Forces Approach El Adem

Berlin, Sixteenth, Havas News Agency Telegram: The local radio station announced that although sandstorms are fierce on the North African front, the German-Italian Allied Forces are still making progress. The important positions of the British army west and northwest of El Adem have been destroyed after fierce fighting, so the British army has withdrawn to the north. Our army has also occupied the area north of Acroma and cut off the British army's retreat. In addition, our air force is also extremely active. Although the weather in North Africa is bad, our aircraft still sortied to bomb the enemy's mechanized forces on the road to Bardia.

Swiss Capital, Seventeenth, Allied News Agency Telegram: In Libya, the German army used its superior tanks and firepower, and the British army, under the able command of General Neame, has been forced to retreat to the outer perimeter of Tobruk's two major strongholds, one being El Adem and the other being Acroma, and is still pursuing with all its strength. After a new offensive of two days, it has approached El Adem, which is located 20 miles south of Tobruk. General Ritchie, the British commander in Tobruk, has sent an urgent message to the Middle East Command Headquarters, requesting reinforcements to boost the morale of the Eighth Army defending Tobruk. The two armies have been fighting fiercely since the night before. Fortunately, the British Eighth Army has been replenished and its defense line has not been broken. The South African 1st and 15th Divisions, which are holding the salient south of Gazala, have also not been cut off. The Battle of Libya has been going on for 18 days, and the British army has retreated from the Gazala to Bir Hakeim front line to a new defense line, which runs from Acroma through El Adem to the south. There is no trace of British troops west of Acroma.

Rome, Sixteenth, Havas News Agency Telegram: According to the Italian evening newspaper, the British army's failure in Libya is the most serious this time. It is estimated that six British divisions are surrounded in the Gazala area, and the two divisions defending Tobruk are also in danger of being annihilated. In addition, the "Piccolo Giornale" published an article by military commentator General Bratty, which briefly stated that the Italian-German Allied Forces' great victory in Libya was due to the rapid advance after occupying Bir Hakeim, and the British army's strategic errors were also a factor, because the British army was confident in its southern defense line and initially thought that it could hold firm.

Libyan Border Area, Sixteenth, Havas News Agency Telegram: The German-Italian Allied Forces in North Africa achieved a surprising victory, connecting Gazala and Tobruk to the Mediterranean coast.

British Troops in Gazala Isolated

The situation is roughly as follows: After the fall of Bir Hakeim, the southern base of the British army's first line of defense was controlled by the German army. The German army then advanced simultaneously in the northeast and northwest directions. A part of its armored division advanced towards Knightsbridge, turned towards Acroma, and from there reached the coast. As a result, the British army in the Gazala area was isolated, and the southwest and south of Tobruk were also threatened. At the same time, the second batch of German armored troops also attacked El Adem and advanced towards the town of Retzegg, which was occupied by the British army, in order to coordinate with the German army in the Knightsbridge area. The British army is now planning to withdraw the vanguard troops currently fighting at Knightsbridge and Acroma in order to deploy a new position on the line through El Adem and Gobi, and then continue to resist. However, it is expected that the German army will give full play to the results of the battle and take rapid action to prevent the British army from regrouping. From now on, the army will intensify its encirclement of Tobruk and launch an all-out attack on Egypt.

Cairo, Sixteenth, Havas News Agency Telegram: The Middle East Command Headquarters of the British Army announced today that General Ritchie had withdrawn the South African 1st Division and the British 5th Division from the south of Gazala. The enemy army attacked repeatedly on the 14th of this month, but was repelled by our armored divisions. When the British army withdrew, the armored troops assisted in attacking the enemy's left and right wings. At the same time, British aircraft were also extremely active, bombing the enemy army in the El Adem area and destroying several enemy aircraft in air battles. In addition, British aircraft also bombed Heraklion and Timbaki in Crete.

German Side Admits Fighting Is Difficult

Berlin, Seventeenth, Huitong News Agency Telegram: War correspondent Hellion reported from the North African front yesterday that the climate there is hot, water is scarce, and there are strong sandstorms, making the army's situation very difficult. The lack of drinking water causes the soldiers the greatest pain. They fight in the hot sun, their faces are stained with dust, and their eyes are red and swollen. Most people regard cold water as a gift. Each soldier has a limited amount of water, which is only enough to keep them from dying of thirst. The enemy troops are often affected as well. The wind and sand are also fierce. Sometimes the surroundings are surrounded by dense sand, making it difficult to distinguish objects. Fine sand particles can be said to penetrate everywhere. People's eyes, ears, noses, and mouths are often invaded by sand particles, which is very uncomfortable.

Berlin, Seventeenth, Huitong News Agency Telegram: German military experts declared that after the Axis forces in North Africa reached the Mediterranean coast and cut the British army in Gazala into two parts, their transportation lines have been greatly shortened and their supply situation has been greatly improved, while the British supply has encountered extremely difficult problems. The British escort fleet in the Mediterranean Sea has been difficult to maintain, and the enemy's repair work has also been greatly affected. The heavy losses of the enemy's armored units and the difficulty of repair work have severely damaged the enemy's strength. The temperature in the area is usually between 33 and 55 degrees Celsius at noon, and there are often strong winds along the coast, which stir up sand and dust, making combat very difficult.

British Troops Ambushed West of Knightsbridge

Stockholm, Seventeenth, Huitong News Agency Telegram: The London Times quoted a reporter in Cairo as saying that a British tank convoy operating in Marmarica was lured to the west of Knightsbridge. Just as a strong sandstorm made visibility poor, it fell into the Axis army's ambush. The enemy's German and Italian flat-fire guns and artillery concentrated their bombardment, and shells fell like rain. The British army was caught off guard, and the formation was scattered. The tank drivers were blinded by the sandstorm, which made the vehicles move very slowly. Fortunately, they were able to escape, but they had already suffered losses.

Ankara, Seventeenth, Huitong News Agency Telegram: According to news received here, the battle for the crossroads set up at Knightsbridge has been going on for several weeks. Now the British defense forces have withdrawn. Knightsbridge is located west of El Adem in Cyrenaica.

### Ciano Meets with Suner in Lake Heng. Significance of Suner's Visit Aims to Consolidate Friendship Between Two Countries

Rome, Sixteenth, Havas News Agency Telegram: All parties here unanimously welcomed the Spanish Foreign Minister Suner's visit to Thailand and considered the visit to be of great significance, such as the "Telegram News" which stated that Italy and Spain were fraternal countries. During the Spanish Civil War, they fought side by side on the battlefield, and Fascist Italy fully understood the wishes of Spain. The Spanish Foreign Minister also knew this very well.

Rome, Seventeenth, Huitong News Agency Telegram: Spanish Foreign Minister Dr. Suner inspected the naval school in Livorno, and the city hung flags to welcome him. Italian newspapers emphasized that Suner's meeting with Italian Foreign Minister Ciano was very harmonious.

Rome, Seventeenth, Huitong News Agency Telegram: The attention of the political circles is focused on the Spanish Foreign Minister Suner, who is currently visiting Italy. A few days ago, it was rumored that Suner's visit was purely of a private nature, but this has now been proven to not be entirely the case. Yesterday morning, the newspapers published an official bulletin of Suner's arrival here, but it did not mention that Suner's visit was of a private nature, so it is believed that it may contain political significance. The "Piccolo Newspaper" published a political commentary on Suner's visit to Italy yesterday afternoon, stating that "the friendship between Italy and Spain, which was built on the battlefield, will last forever and will never be destroyed. Suner's visit to Italy is enough to consolidate the friendship between the two countries and unite these two major Latin countries to work together to build a new Europe." The newspaper pointed out the significance of choosing Lake Heng as the meeting place, saying that Lake Heng has the spirit of ancient times and the ambition of modern times. In addition, the city is the birthplace of the Italian navy, and the Italian naval officers and soldiers who were trained in Lake Heng have now defeated the largest naval country in the world in the Mediterranean Sea. The "Italian Voice" obtained news from Lake Heng that the spirit of the meeting between the Spanish and Italian Foreign Ministers was extremely harmonious.

### Pétain's Second Anniversary in Power; Issues Proclamation to the People, Urging Them Not to Be Selfish and to Place Faith in the Fate of the Country; Expresses Patriotic Devotion to the People with Sorrow

Vichy, Seventeenth, Havas News Agency Telegram: Marshal Pétain has been in power for two years and issued a proclamation to the people today, saying, "French people, on June 17, 1940, when our country requested a ceasefire in a tragic situation, I tried to persuade the people to restrain their grief and place their faith in the fate of our country. One year later, on June 17, 1941, I again told you that the task is heavy and the road is long. Today, I can only encourage you with these words. In today's world, wars are everywhere, and France stands in the middle of it. Prosperity and decline are both possible. Even if there is sadness, it is not worth mentioning. Our country is gradually extricating itself. Although it is extremely painful, the decision made two years ago is of great significance. The possibility of our country's material and spiritual revival is pregnant here. The response to my appeal from all parties has been very weak, and I do not want to hide it. It is also true that the government's actions have not been without errors. For example, food is insufficient, resulting in unfair distribution, and speculators have not been brought to justice. It is also human nature that workers suffer and become passive. The people of the whole country are impatient, and the duties of mayors of cities are too heavy, and there is a trend of accumulating problems. Do you think that restoring the old methods can be more helpful? In addition to the shortcomings of the country, are not the greed and selfishness of many French people related to the failure of various efforts? Is it not against injustice, unkindness, and the power of money to corrupt personality that the resentment and dissatisfaction among the people are increasing rather than decreasing? I am very sad because of these things, but in view of the tragic situation of the people today, these things are even more abominable. On the day after our defeat in the war, I saw that many French people failed to fulfill their duties, but I did not lose faith because of this. Fatigue, negligence, and condemnation cannot deter me. On the contrary, the smiles of infants, the tenderness of mothers, and the vitality of young people are enough to restore my courage. One or two years have passed since the armistice. In these two years, hope and disappointment, instability and various sacrifices have come one after another. Is this not the path that a wounded France, a blind France, must take to grope for its fate? My France will have a day of prosperity, and I am convinced of this. Dear compatriots, please eliminate fear and resentful criticism in your hearts, and think of the leaders who love you. The leaders are still standing with you in the storm, countless prisoners are still far away from you, your fields disappoint you, your factories work slowly, and your families are still suffering from hunger and cold. Your leaders will never forget all of this. They wish that on the anniversary of one of the most tragic weeks in our country's history, you would all have great hope to save our country. Long live France!"

### Czech Workers Hold Meeting

Prague, Seventeenth, Huitong News Agency Telegram: Last night, more than 60,000 Czech workers gathered in Pilsen to hold a mass meeting. Propaganda Minister Moravec attended and delivered a speech, explaining the great significance of fighting for the construction of a new Europe. He briefly stated that if Germany failed this time, 400 million people in Europe would suffer from famine and starvation. Britain would turn a blind eye to this and would not provide assistance. After the politicians of the democratic countries handed over Europe to the Bolsheviks, they would still impose a blockade on Europe. The duty of every Czech today is to actively eliminate harm for the country. The murderer who assassinated the German Deputy Commissioner is not a hero, but a traitor to the entire nation. Our goal is very clear, that is, to fight against England side by side with Germany. The German leader is the leader of the German workers and the new Europe. I pay tribute to him here.

### The Battle for Sevastopol Port is in Full Swing; German Reinforcements Prevent Soviet Counterattack; Soviets Deploy Heavy Tanks Encountering Formidable Opponents

United Press, Bear City, 17th – The Germans have dispatched large forces and are using heavier artillery than in the First World War to attack the front lines at Kharkov and Sevastopol, preventing Soviet counteroffensives around those two locations. The siege of Sevastopol continues fiercely. Official reports state that German attacks on Kharkov and Sevastopol's defenses are proving arduous. According to recent battle reports, the 52-ton heavy tanks used by Soviet General Timoshenko in the Ukrainian offensive have encountered a fierce assault from General Bock's armored forces. In several areas, German forces have broken through the main force of the Soviet offensive and driven them back.

Havas News Agency, Somewhere on the Ukrainian Front, 16th – Over the past 24 hours, the battle for Sevastopol has been in full swing, with German pressure particularly intense in the southern sector. The German-Romanian forces, supported by strong artillery and tanks, reached the Black Sea coast one mile west of St. George's Monastery yesterday afternoon. The monastery was a strong Red Army fortress, and the German-Romanian forces only managed to capture it after a fierce hand-to-hand combat. This has shortened the battle line in the area by four miles. The Soviet fleet bombarded German positions along the Black Sea coast last night. It is rumored that several Soviet warships have recently arrived at Sevastopol Port from Novorossiysk and other ports in the Caucasus, presumably to protect the retreat of the defending troops. It is also noteworthy that the Red Army is dismantling various military facilities and warehouses in the port. In order to relieve the threat to Sevastopol, the Red Army has dispatched four infantry divisions, attempting to land in various locations near the port to attack the German rear. However, so far, these attempts have not been successful. As for other areas north of Sevastopol, the fighting is most intense east of Kharkov. German forces in that area have crossed the Donets River and continue to advance, crushing the Red Army near Rayhorodok. Elsewhere, German forces in Kereselk are also showing signs of activity, attempting to launch local offensives from the north and south of the city. In the Izium area, the fighting is at a stalemate, but important developments may occur soon.

Havas News Agency, Moscow, 16th – TASS issued a message today acknowledging that the pressure exerted by Axis forces on Sevastopol Port is increasing daily. The message stated: "Our situation is quite serious. Over the past two months, the German-Romanian forces have been reinforced with fresh troops and have been constantly attacking us fiercely. Therefore, bloody battles have broken out on both the northern and southern fronts." However, the Red Army's land and air forces are fighting bravely. The bodies of German-Romanian soldiers are scattered everywhere near Sevastopol Port. It is estimated that the German High Command has concentrated seven infantry divisions and 150 tanks in these two areas.

Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 17th – According to further details of the situation in the Sevastopol region released by the German High Command last night, the success of the German offensive on the Sevastopol front has forced the Soviet forces to resort to desperate measures, launching counterattacks by land and using warships. Therefore, the German Air Force's participation in the attack on Soviet warships in Sevastopol Port has been very successful. The German fleet off the coast of Yevpatoria, northwest of Sevastopol, repelled Soviet warships. Enemy attempts to land near Yalta, southeast of Sevastopol, and Mariupol on the Sea of Azov coast were unsuccessful.

### Soviet Troops are Duty-Bound to Defend the Land; Sevastopol Port is Like Hell

United Press, Lisbon, 16th – German attacks on Sevastopol are becoming increasingly fierce. On the 15th, they sent another 500,000 troops to destroy several Soviet defense lines. The Soviet side has deployed the Black Sea Fleet to bombard the German rear. Both sides are currently engaged in intense fighting. According to a British Broadcasting Corporation broadcast on the 16th, German forces launched repeated fierce attacks on the fortresses south of Sevastopol on the 16th. Thousands of German aircraft were deployed, concentrating on bombing port facilities and Soviet positions. The artillery used long-range guns to bombard Soviet positions. Sevastopol Port is now a living hell, and the situation is extremely tragic. TASS and the Communist Party newspaper Pravda have also confirmed that Sevastopol is facing a major crisis and stated that Soviet troops should defend the port to the last man.

### German Forces Prepare to Launch Another Offensive Against Leningrad

Havas News Agency, Stockholm, 16th – The "Aftonbladet" here recently reported that, according to reliable sources in Helsinki, the German High Command is preparing a large-scale offensive against Leningrad, as the Germans consider this important town to be a preliminary strategic objective.

Haitong News Agency, Helsinki, 17th – The Finnish High Command stated yesterday that on Monday, the fighting on the land front was limited to exchanges of fire between reconnaissance units. Enemy warships were bombarded by our coastal artillery and sailed east towards Kronstadt Bay under the cover of smoke. In air combat south of the Svir River, our aircraft shot down two new-model enemy aircraft. All our aircraft returned safely to base. Yesterday afternoon, enemy aircraft bombed Lodeynoye Pole, killing two people and injuring ten others. There was also material damage. Other coastal areas issued air raid warnings due to enemy aircraft attacks, but no bombs were dropped.

### German Aircraft Active Everywhere, Bombing Soviet Transport Lines

### German and Italian Naval and Air Forces Attack British Convoy; Germans Claim Great Victory; Italian Heavy Cruiser Sunk

Haitong News Agency, Fuehrer's Headquarters, 17th – The German High Command issued a special battle report last night stating that the cooperation of the German and Italian naval and air forces in attacking a heavily protected British convoy sailing from Alexandria has dealt a major blow to the British Navy and British shipping lanes. Between June 12th and 15th, the German and Italian naval and air forces sank four cruisers and destroyers, two patrol boats, and six merchant ships, totaling 56,000 tons. In addition, one destroyer and eight merchant ships were hit by torpedoes or bombs and caught fire, with the severity of the damage warranting inclusion on the list of losses. Furthermore, six warships and six merchant ships were also hit by torpedoes or bombs. A total of 33 escorting British aircraft were shot down, and ten German aircraft went missing. The remnants of the convoy were forced to turn back. German submarines, commanded by Vice Admiral Reichke, sank a British cruiser in this battle.

United Press, Rome, 16th – The Italian High Command announced the Mediterranean battle situation on the 16th, stating that the great naval and air battle in the Mediterranean ended last night. The Italian Navy and Air Force achieved great results. On the morning of the 15th, a naval force composed of two Italian light cruisers and five torpedo boats fiercely attacked a strong enemy convoy sailing from Gibraltar to Malta. The enemy convoy consisted of two cruisers, thirteen minesweepers, and several destroyers, which were numerically superior. However, after being attacked from all sides, they released smoke screens and scattered in all directions. Another battle occurred later, in which our cruisers sank one enemy cruiser and damaged two destroyers. They also launched torpedoes to attack and severely damage one enemy cruiser and one destroyer each. Our heavy cruiser was sunk by enemy aerial and underwater torpedoes. Although another torpedo boat was severely damaged, it safely returned to base. Our bombers and submarines attacked and severely damaged an enemy convoy sailing from Alexandria to Malta.

Haitong News Agency, Stockholm, 17th – According to London sources, the British side is maintaining silence on the Mediterranean convoy battle. The newspapers only publish official communiqués. The newspapers deny German and Italian reports of British ship losses. London insists that although the convoy was heavily attacked, it reached Malta and Tobruk. American long-range bombers assisted in attacking enemy ships.

Haitong News Agency, Madrid, 17th – The ABC newspaper here commented on the great naval and air battle in the Mediterranean on Monday, stating that the Italian Air Force's great victory in the Mediterranean has added a glorious page to the history of the Axis war in North Africa. The actions of the Axis forces in North Africa have a pincer-like posture, but the hot climate in Libya seems not to have taken into account the occupation of Tobruk.

Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 17th – Last night, the German press prominently published news of the Axis victory in the Mediterranean and the situation on the North African front. German newspapers compared Churchill's optimistic remarks three weeks ago with the serious facts now revealed. The "Berliner Börsen-Zeitung" cited Churchill's statement a few days after the start of the North African campaign, stating that General Rommel's plan had completely failed and that he would therefore waste a large amount of manpower and resources. German newspapers believe that the destruction of the British convoy in the Mediterranean is directly related to the North African campaign. The "Berliner Börsen-Zeitung" stated that the damage suffered by the British convoy in the Mediterranean was so severe that they dared not mention it. The result of this has already affected the North African campaign. Britain can no longer use ostrich-like tactics to avoid the current facts.

### Allied Ships Sunk Four

### Rumor Allied Nations will Issue Declaration Clarifying Post-War Political Intentions; Finland Expresses Concern About Anglo-Soviet Alliance

Havas News Agency, Bern, Switzerland, 16th – Newspapers here recently quoted a correspondent in London as saying that the Allied nations will soon issue a declaration clarifying their political intentions after the current war ends. British newspapers have been commenting on this matter, but there has been no definite indication of what plans the Allied nations have for a peace organization. For example, the "Daily Express" recently published an article advocating a three-year transition period from the armistice agreement to the formal establishment of a peace treaty. This news is related to what British Minister of Information Bracken recently told foreign journalists that the first task after the war is to ensure that the people of all European countries have access to a large amount of food.

Havas News Agency, Helsinki, Finland, 16th – The recent alliance between Britain and the Soviet Union has been commented on by newspapers here, with particular emphasis on the possible impact on Finland. For example, the "Uusi Suomi" stated, "It is very possible that this treaty has supplementary secret clauses. In any case, its main parts must contain dangerous consequences that will cause concern among the people of our country. Britain's attitude towards the Soviet Union has been expressed in this treaty. In short, it is to fully respect Soviet demands." The "Suomen Sosialidemokraatti" also stated, "If the Soviet Union assumes the role of police after the war, all European countries, especially small ones, will be dissatisfied. Britain has always opposed the Soviet Union's annexation of Poland, the Baltic states, and Finland. The United States has also never recognized any changes in postwar borders. Fortunately, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov's recent visit to Britain and the United States did not achieve his wishes. But one point is worth noting, that the Soviet Union is never bound by any treaty and only knows how to seize opportunities. Assuming that the treaty nations eventually win, how will the United States be able to prevent the Soviet Union from doing whatever it wants in the future? This is a question."

### Soviet Envoy Delegation Arrives in Mexico

### Chilean President Advises People to be Cautious in their Speech

Havas News Agency, Santiago, Chile, 10th – President Ríos met with the German Ambassador today and later declared to others that Chilean newspapers had published articles that the German side considered "detrimental to German dignity" and had lodged a protest with me.

### Five · Random Talks About Egypt

(Rural Sketches) The residents on both sides of the Nile River build earthen walls with gray soil. Upon entering a village, one feels cramped and the sounds are noisy. The voices of people and livestock intermingle, and cow dung is burned everywhere, with a unique rustic scent wafting in the air. Early in the morning, the streets are already bustling with noise. A donkey is tied to the entrance of the coppersmith's shop. The animal is naturally mischievous, constantly kicking with its hind legs. The owner is taking a roll of blue linen off the donkey's back, trying to sell it to the coppersmith. Coincidentally, the barber from the village, wearing slippers, leisurely runs over. The coppersmith once made a copper shaving basin for him, and now, not interested in buying the linen, introduces it to the barber. But the barber is quite pitiful, having shaved heads for a year and only received a basket of lentils in return, so where would he get the spare money to buy such fabric? A few children are chasing ducks to play with. The ducks run onto a pile of dry river mud, and the children chase after them, determined to catch them. A beggar rides a donkey and arrives, seeing a lot of people, he dismounts to beg. Counting the money he received, he remounts the old, pitifully thin donkey and mumbles away.

Suddenly, a sharp cry arises at one end of the street: a mule, carrying six times its weight in goods, knocks over a bucket of milk. It turns out the customer wants to personally watch the farmer milk the cow into the bucket to prevent her from adding water behind his back. Onlookers form a large circle, halting the street traffic for a long time. Following that, a tall camel, walking with its head held high, comes slowly, its humps tied with large and heavy bags of grain. The camel spots a clump of weeds by the side of the street, lowers its head, and chews leisurely, as impatient people around it make a racket. Amidst all the noise, another sound flies from the sky, it is the muezzin from the minaret of the mosque, reciting the second timed call of the day.

(Calculation of the Calendar) Because of the Nile's floods, Egyptians naturally divided the year into three parts: the flood season, the planting season, and the harvest season. The year was set to twelve months, and the month to thirty days. As such, there were always a few extra days each year, and after five hundred years, the original flood season became the harvest season. To correct this error, a recalculation was required: someone had already invented the calendar we use today six thousand years ago. One cannot but praise the greatness of the people of that era. The Egyptians not only made inventions regarding the calendar, but also gradually developed astronomy, geography, architecture, and painting. Even in terms of decoration, they knew how to use necklaces around the neck as early as two thousand years BC. Moreover, the exquisiteness of gemstone polishing and the delicacy of gold and silver inlays, the mystery of this technology, and how they used large blocks of stone to build the enormous pyramids, are all inexplicable to us modern people.

(The Pyramids - Products of Megalomania) The Nile River meanders north through Upper Egypt, vast and mighty, until it reaches Cairo, the largest city in Africa. The river surface is wide, and the current is smooth. The west bank is a vast green land, and the east bank has mountains as a barrier. The course of the Nile River ends here. Further north, it branches into a fragmented river network, which is the famous Delta.

Fifty miles from Cairo, six pyramids rise continuously in the green countryside. The light is very bright, and the mountains are low, making them very clear when viewed from the Nile. This is not a temple for idols, nor a symbol of power, nor is it for the enjoyment of life: the construction of the pyramids is entirely the product of the ruler's megalomania and fear of death, which led to the construction of these immortal architectural wonders.

Next to the pyramids, there is also a Sphinx. Half of the statue is buried in the sand. It is said that at one point, the entire statue was about to sink into the soil. Later, Prince Roma-something was taking a nap by the statue during a certain expedition, and the Sphinx appeared to him in a dream: "If you can excavate me and bring me into the world, I will help you become the king of Egypt." Later, it was buried by a great sandstorm due to the prince. Now, thousands of years later, like the pyramids, it has become a source of pride after excavation. At least it has not been eroded by the sun in the desert, and those seeking world curiosities can still admire and praise this ancient world heritage.

### Germany Expands Maritime War Zone, South American Countries Affected, Argentina Controls Axis Assets

Buenos Aires, 16th (Havas) - After Germany decided to expand its submarine warfare zone to the American coast, government officials expressed concern, saying that most of Argentina's exports are directly shipped to the United States, and its main imports are also from the United States, making the relationship very important. It is heard that the trade volume between the United States and Argentina has decreased. Undersecretary of Foreign Affairs Casia and German Charge d'Affaires Me Xiong held talks today to discuss this issue. As of now, apart from Me Xiong officially confirming Germany's decision, the authorities have not made any statements. It is heard that Germany had provided Argentina with certain guarantees in advance, declaring respect for the neutral status of Argentine merchant ships, even in the blockade zone, but this has not yet been confirmed.

Buenos Aires, 18th (Allied Press) - Germany's announcement of expanding the war zone has greatly affected trade between Canada, the United States, and South American countries. A report from the capital of Brazil states that the Brazilian press is the first to be affected. Due to the shortage of paper, various newspapers have reduced their page counts. If this situation persists, Brazilian newspapers will be completely suspended within the next two months. In the past, Brazil published more than 800 newspapers, requiring 70,000 tons of paper annually. Now, at a minimum, 4,000 tons of paper must be imported monthly.

Buenos Aires, 16th (Havas) - The Argentine government today, in accordance with the resolution of the Pan-American Conference, that all countries in the Western Hemisphere should sever commercial and financial ties with the Axis powers, ordered the control of all Axis-owned factories and companies within the country, and dispatched a supervisory officer to reside in each company, controlling the company's finances and operations.

The ship originally belonged to Belgium, has a displacement of 4,000 tons, and arrived in Lisbon from Casablanca on June 9, where it was formally handed over to the Red Cross after inspection. It is heard that the motivation for establishing the fund management committee to operate its own maritime transport is to enable prisoners of war and detained civilians in various locations to obtain the necessary assistance as soon as possible.

The location of the retail rice shop is above, and the registration number of the rice shop is on the left end.

Liaisons and Heads of Households Assist in Notification

Hereby respectfully request that the owners of properties and heads of households must carefully remember their light section and the address of the office where they should go to collect the rice purchase certificate. At the appropriate time, the Liaison Officer or other means will notify the relevant persons of the address of the office and the date for collecting the rice certificate. Therefore, in order to avoid omissions and delays in issuing the rice certificate, it is hoped that the owners of properties and heads of households will strictly comply with the above methods.

Formal Rationing to Begin on July 6th

According to Datong reporters, the collection of this rice purchase certificate is limited to two weeks, so the date for implementing per capita rationing is scheduled to begin on Monday, July 6. In order to take parallel steps with the International Settlement, the French Concession has confirmed that it will also start on the same day. There are a total of 657 rice shops in the two concessions that have signed retail contracts with the Rice Management Committee of the Shanghai Municipal Council, including 414 in the International Settlement and 243 in the French Concession. Each rice shop should prepare a wooden sign painted with the registration number, which has been completed and will be hung in a conspicuous place in each rice shop starting from July 1st.

New Rice Shops Temporarily Not Distributing Rice

The Rice Office of the Shanghai Municipal Council continued to designate the Taikoo Warehouse and the Zhejiang Xingye Warehouse yesterday as places for rice shops to pick up rice, totaling more than 10,000 bags. The foreign rice will still only be supplied to the original 372 rice shops in the two concessions. The additional 285 shops must wait until the per capita rationing is implemented on the 6th of next month to be allocated. The office also sent a letter to the rice shops yesterday, stating: "To whom it may concern, this office will be closed on Thursday, the 18th of this month. After the purchase order is paid today, the warehouse receipt should be picked up between 2:00 PM and 4:00 PM in the afternoon without fail."

### Some Stores Redefine Prices, Raising Prices Invisibly, the Public Should Report Immediately

The Shanghai Times reports that the most important price control regulations issued by the municipal authorities of the three districts in order to combat profiteering and hoarding took effect yesterday morning (July 17). Many members of the public are paying attention to changes in prices, and promptly report any violations to the authorities. It has been found that the International Settlement, the French Concession, and the Western District announced on Monday night that from yesterday morning until further notice, the retail prices calculated in savings certificates must not exceed half of the average price in old legal tender between May 26 and 28. This measure has taken effect, as some stores have removed price tags and redefined prices. Many unscrupulous merchants do not adjust the prices, but only add savings certificates to the original price, thus invisibly doubling the price. Only a few have actually lowered the old prices. The authorities issued a joint order, forcing merchants to set fair prices.

### Banking Industry Tightens Lending, Interest on Loans Set at 2.4% to 3%, Maximum Interest on Deposits is 1%

Allied News Agency reports that the banking industry in the city previously had abundant floating capital, a surge in deposits, and a lack of investment in industry and commerce, resulting in wasted deposit interest and significant losses. Deposits have been withdrawn in large quantities, and most of the floating capital has been transferred to invest in industries. As a result, deposits in banks and native banks have gradually decreased. Now, since the implementation of the new currency, the cash reserves and all deposits and loans of various banks and native banks have been converted into reserve certificates at a ratio of two to one. It has now been decided to increase loan interest and reduce deposit interest. The loan interest is set at 2.4% to 3%, and the maximum deposit interest is 1%. According to this principle, each bank and native bank will handle it at their discretion.

### Trams in Both Concessions Still Use Old Subsidiary Currency, Using 10 Cents to Replace 5 Cents in Savings Certificates

Public transport vehicles in both concessions have stopped accepting old legal tender since yesterday. However, trams and buses in the French Concession still accept old subsidiary currency, because the notice from the French Tram Company only prohibits the use of old legal tender of one yuan or more. As for the trams in the International Settlement, although the company authorities have announced that they will not accept any old legal tender, in fact, they still accepted 10-cent notes yesterday and often gave them to passengers as change. This is because the tram fare in the International Settlement has a fraction of 5 cents in savings certificates, and 5-cent savings certificates are not widely circulated, so the old 10-cent notes are temporarily used as a substitute.

### French Concession Household Registration Certificate to be Issued Soon, Identity Cards for Baojia Chiefs Being Filled Out

The household registration survey in the French Concession has now been completed by the efforts of the Baojia chiefs in each liaison district. The household registration certificates have also been filled out by the police stations under the jurisdiction of each district. In order to permanently preserve the household registration certificates, the authorities have specially made a transparent plastic bag, which will be collected from each household at the wholesale price of four yuan in new currency, which must be paid to the Jia chiefs, so as to be paid to the Baojia Committee. As for the identity cards of the Baojia chiefs, each district police station has notified the liaison chiefs to quickly find out the names, ages, occupations, addresses, and places of birth of the Baojia chiefs under their jurisdiction and report them, so that identity cards can be issued.

### Today is the Dragon Boat Festival: Settlement of Accounts in Various Industries; Banking and Market Industries are Closed for One Day

Today is the Lunar Calendar's Dragon Boat Festival. Banking, commercial, and industrial sectors in the city are following custom to settle accounts for the festival. Dealings between various trades and debts owed by customers must be cleared. Representatives from various commercial and industrial firms are dispatched with final account notices, busily urging payment. However, because most industries have been dealing in cash this year, debts between trades are less than in previous years. Furthermore, it coincides with the implementation of the Currency Reserve System, making transfers busy. Tomorrow, the Public Works Department, the Shanghai branch of the Reserve Bank, all banking and money industries, and all market dark markets will take a day off and close.

### Bandits Form Gang: Falsely Claim Search

Detectives from the Xinzha Police Station previously arrested criminals Chen Yushi, Cao Peng, Yin Yongda, Zhu Guozhang, Zheng Qian, and five others. They were taken to the police station for investigation. It was learned that these people, together with the four fugitives including Yang Yong, had, on the afternoon of the 1st of this month at 1:30 PM, impersonated authorities and broke into house number 140, Lane 1536, Xinzha Road, claiming to search for drugs. In the meantime, they stole seven pounds of coffee essence worth 5,000 yuan in reserve currency and escaped. Also, Chen Yushi and Zhu Guohua, on the morning of May 26th at 9:40 AM, falsely claiming authority, suddenly broke into Changzhou Inn, number 3, Lane 422, North Zhejiang Road, claiming that the innkeeper Wu Azhong had been arrested in connection with a case, intending to extort 20,000 yuan from his wife, Wu Xu. According to Chen Yushi's confession at the police station, he met a friend, Yang Yong, one day who asked him to gather at room 467 of the Jue Lu Hotel on Chuching Road to discuss a matter, saying that there was a lot of heroin somewhere that could be seized. As he spoke, he took out a card with a title, and Chen believed him. He then went to Jue Lu and, along with the others, went to number 140, Lane 1536, Xinzha Road, and seized seven and a half pounds of heroin, which they sold for 6,900 yuan. They were ordered to be detained pending investigation and transfer.

### Defrauding Female Shop Owner, Embezzling Funds, and Fleeing

Zheng Hongxing, a native of Ningbo (33 years old), had been working as a manager and accountant at the Taixin Rice Wine Shop at number 470, Tokyo Road. The shop owner was a female fellow-townsman named Shen Juying, and Zheng held all the major powers. From May of last year to May of this year, he successively embezzled 10,000 yuan in legal tender from handled goods and bean oil, which he could not make up for. He fled without a trace, disappearing like a yellow crane. Mrs. Shen reported the situation to the Gordon Road Police Station, which dispatched detective Sun Xiaokun, who, based on a confidential tip, found and arrested him around 3:00 PM the other day. He was taken to the police station and prosecuted for embezzlement according to criminal law, with a request for detention. The defendant's confession was evasive, and he requested to go out to find a way to manage. According to Mrs. Shen, she noticed a sudden change in his behavior and asked someone to check the accounts, and he left without saying goodbye and disappeared.

### Pawning Fake Bracelets at Zancheng Treasure Shop

Chen Chunmei, a young woman from Ningbo, 25 years old, residing at number 3, Houjiabang, Nanshi, specializes in using fake gold-inlaid rings to pawn for money at pawnshops. Starting from the 5th of last month, Chen pawned eight of these fake rings at the Chunlai Pawnshop at number 124, Caishi Street, French Concession, for over 200 yuan. Because they were well-made and indistinguishable from real ones, she had never been detected. Yesterday morning, the woman went to pawn again. The pawnshop suspected how she had so many gold rings, which aroused their suspicion. They used test water to check and discovered they were fake. They immediately called the police, who arrived and took the woman into custody, along with the previously pawned fake rings, as evidence. After interrogation at the police station, she was detained for investigation.

### Dragon Boat Festival History by Liutang

For a long time, May has been considered a poisonous month, and the fifth day of the fifth month an evil day. The origin of this is ancient, but the explanation is unknown. The Book of the Later Han Dynasty states:

"In the middle of summer, the [fifth] month, all things are flourishing. The day is the summer solstice, and the yin energy begins to sprout, fearing that things will not flourish. The rituals involve using vermilion ropes to connect pungent vegetables, offering them to the god Mimou, beating drums, and using peach seals, six inches long and two inches square, with five-colored written charms according to ritual, to apply to gates and doors. Each dynasty uses what it favors as offerings: The Xiahou clan, associated with metal, made reed caltrops, symbolizing the exchange of qi. The Yin people, associated with water, used snail heads to carefully close off, making them like snails. The Zhou people, associated with wood, used peaches for change, symbolizing the mutual exchange of qi. All [methods] were used together. On the fifth day of the fifth month, vermilion ropes and five-colored seals were used as door decorations to ward off evil qi."

The summer solstice is the mid-month festival in May. In terms of hexagrams, it corresponds to "Encounter" with a strong wind, and one yin begins to be born. The winter solstice corresponds to "Return" with thunder under the earth, and the yang begins to be born. In Jiangnan, the summer solstice falls during the rainy season. Grain in Ear coincides with the "internal mold" rains, just before the summer solstice, and the end of the mold rains is after the summer solstice. After the rainy season comes the summer heat, and all things naturally respond by growing. However, poisonous snakes and insects, as well as epidemics and summer diseases, thrive as a result. This is why the ancients were so apprehensive, fearing that all things would not be able to flourish. Since they had no way to prevent these things, nor the means to drive them away, they could only resort to apotropaic methods. Vermilion ropes, five-colored peach seals used as door decorations to ward off evil qi are the precursors to later shamanic swords and door charms. Therefore, setting May as a poisonous month is not without meaning.

Although the summer solstice is the mid-month festival in May, there is a saying that "Summer Solstice Eve rarely meets the Dragon Boat Festival, and a hundred years rarely meet the Spring Festival at the beginning of the year." Indeed, the Dragon Boat Festival coinciding with the summer solstice is rare. In 18th year of the Republic of China, it was missed by a late day. However, in the first year of the official era, the summer solstice did indeed coincide with the Dragon Boat Festival. The twelfth year of the Republic of China was also the Spring Festival at the beginning of the year. Therefore, those born before the fifth day of the year, at the age of thirty-four, have already experienced what is said to be rare.

The saying that the fifth day of the fifth month is an evil day is seen in the Records of the Grand Historian in the biography of Lord Mengchang:

"Tian Ying had more than ten sons. A concubine had a son named Wen. Wen was born on the fifth day of the fifth month, and Ying told his mother, 'Do not raise him.' But his mother secretly raised him. When he grew up, his mother, through his brothers, had her son Wen meet Tian Ying. Tian Ying was angry at his mother and said, 'If I were to abandon this child, how dare you give birth to him?' Wen bowed his head and asked, 'Why does Your Lordship not raise a child born in the fifth month?' Ying said, 'A child born in the fifth month will grow as tall as the door and will be bad for his parents.' Wen said, 'Does a person's fate come from Heaven or from the door?' Ying was silent. Wen said, 'If his fate comes from Heaven, what does Your Lordship have to worry about? If his fate comes from the door, then he will only be as tall as the middle of the door!' Ying said, 'Stop, my son.'"

And Wen eventually became the heir and was called Lord Mengchang. From then on, all sons born on the fifth day of the fifth month were raised. Wen's rise began here. "Raising" means bathing and nursing a child. "Giving birth" means planning for its growth. According to Popular Customs, it is said that a son born on the fifth day of the fifth month harms his father, and a daughter harms her mother. Although this is superstitious talk, there is still a saying that those born on the fifth day of the fifth month have a "hard fate." A "hard fate" means that they can harm their parents, like Wang Zhen'e, who was born in the evening. The Southern History says:

"Wang Zhen'e: His grandfather, Meng, served Fu Jian and held positions as general and minister. His father, Xiu, was the governor of Hedong. Zhen'e was born in May, and the family wanted to have him adopted into another clan due to the popular taboo. Meng said, 'This is no ordinary child. In the past, Lord Mengchang was born in an evil month and became the Prime Minister of Qi. This child will also bring prosperity to our family.' Therefore, he was named Zhen'e."

Zhen'e later returned to Jin and became a famous general in Song. However, there are also those who consider being born on the Dragon Boat Festival to be auspicious, such as Cui Xinming, the Tang Dynasty poet who is famous for "Maple leaves fall on the Wu River, cold." The New Book of Tang says:

"When Xinming was born, on the fifth day of the fifth month, at midday, strange birds chirped and gathered in the trees of the courtyard. The Grand Astrologer, Shi Liang, divined and said, 'May belongs to fire, and fire represents the trigram of Li, which signifies culture. Midday is the height of culture. The birds are five-colored and chirping; this child will be known for his culture. However, birds are insignificant; his position will probably not be high!'"

Indeed, his words came true. According to the Cold Cottage Miscellany, "Those whose births on the fifth day of the fifth month are recorded in historical books include Lord Mengchang, Hu Guang, Ren Feng, Zhang Huanhou Fei, Wang Zhen'e, Empress Qi, King Qi Nanyang Chuo, Cui Xinming, Emperor Huizong of Song, Weng Yinglong, Ji Mai, Empress Yide of Liao, Zhao Yuan, and others. Their experiences were not the same."

Indeed, historical officials of various dynasties seem to have paid special attention to those born on the Dragon Boat Festival, recording them in great detail. However, as far as we know, Emperor Huizong of Song was born on the tenth day of the tenth month. Among the emperors of the Song Dynasty, only Emperor Gaozong of Song was born on the twenty-first day of the fifth month. None of the others were born in May. Furthermore, there was no Empress Yide in Liao. Only Empress Fu of Emperor Taizong of Song had this posthumous title. These two are likely to be mistakes. Although many of those mentioned were emperors, kings, and nobles, the brothers of the Later Lord of Qi, although from different mothers, were born in the same year, month, and day. Chuo was the eldest son of Emperor Wucheng of Qi, Gao Zhan, and was born at the chen hour (7-9 AM) on the fifth day of the fifth month. At the wu hour (11 AM-1 PM), the Later Lord of Qi, Wei, was born. Chuo's mother, Lady Li, was not the main wife, so he was considered second, while the Later Lord was considered the eldest son. The Later Lord once asked Chuo what was the most enjoyable thing in Zhou (Chuo had once been a governor). Chuo said, "To collect many scorpions, mix them with maggots, and watch, is extremely enjoyable." The Later Lord immediately ordered a peck of scorpions, and by dawn, he had two or three pints. He placed them in a bath, made a person lie naked in the bath, and screamed and writhed. The Emperor and Chuo watched and laughed with delight. The Emperor said to Chuo, "Why didn't you report such an enjoyable thing earlier?" This was cruel, abusive, and inhumane, and considered "such an enjoyable thing." How could he have human feelings? However, the descendants of God of War (Gao Huan) were mostly licentious and fond of killing. Such was the family style; how could it last long? Therefore, Gao Chuo was killed by the Later Lord. The Later Lord himself was captured by Emperor Wu of Zhou (Yuwen Yong), and thirty-three people, including the Prince of Rencheng, were put to death. From then on, only one or two of God of War's descendants survived. Heaven's judgment is not far off; there is indeed retribution. The saying that good and evil will eventually be rewarded is likely the inevitable outcome of the law of karma!

When people talk about Dragon Boat Festival zongzi, five-colored peach ropes, they all say it is made for Qu Yuan. This explanation is based on Record of Harmonizing Anomalies.

"Qu Yuan died by throwing himself into the Miluo River on the fifth day of the fifth month. The people of Chu mourned him, and on this day every year, they stored rice in bamboo tubes and threw them into the water to sacrifice to him. During the Jianwu reign of the Han Dynasty, Qu Hui of Changsha saw a man in broad daylight who claimed to be the Three Grand Counselor. He said to Hui, 'I hear that you often make sacrifices, which is very good. However, all the offerings are stolen by dragons every year. If you are willing to give me something, you can seal them with the leaves of the elm tree and bind them with five-colored silk. The dragons fear these things.' Hui did as he said. On the fifth day of the fifth month, people make zongzi and wear five-colored silk and elm leaves, all remnants of the Miluo tradition."

I say that if this explanation is to be believed, it can only be said to be true for the Wu and Chu regions regarding the Dragon Boat Festival. However, why is it commonly called "Enjoying the Dragon Boat Festival"? "Enjoying" refers to something pleasant and joyful. Some even call it the "Human Festival," from which we know that it is not entirely about commemorating Qu Yuan. Furthermore, in ancient history, grand feasts were often held on the fifth day of the fifth month, not only seen in the Tang Dynasty. For example, during the Kaiyuan period, a banquet was held in the Wucheng Hall on the fifth day of the fifth month, and the officials were granted robes. Li Yuanxian and Xiao Song were given purple robes and gold fish, unmatched by the other officials. It was not only like this in the Tang Dynasty; it was also like this before the Tang Dynasty. The Biography of Cui Chenlun in the History of the North states:

"Julun was detained by Ge Rong, who wanted to make him a yellow gate attendant. Julun hated him. On the fifth day of the fifth month, Rong gathered the officials and ordered Julun to present a poem. Julun then said:

'On the fifth day of the fifth month, the weather is very hot.
Dogs pant and want to die, oxen pant and stick out their tongues.
I use this to hide myself and avoid trouble.'"

Moreover, after the Tang Dynasty, such as during the Liao Dynasty, it was also like this: "On the fifth day of the fifth month, at noon, mugwort leaves and cotton were collected and used to make clothes as offerings to the emperor. The officials, both northern and southern, were each given three items. The ruler and his subjects feasted and made merry. The Bohai chef presented mugwort cakes, and five-colored silk was used as a rope to wrap around the arm, called a 'harmony knot.' Also, a human figure was made from colored silk and worn in the hair, called a 'longevity thread.'"

During the Jin Dynasty, the ritual of worshiping heaven was performed on the fifth day of the fifth month, the middle of the seventh month, and the ninth day of the ninth month. After the ritual, willow shooting and polo playing were performed for entertainment. Polo playing is now popular, so I will describe its playing method.

"For polo, each person rides a horse that they are accustomed to, holding a polo stick, several feet long, with the end shaped like a crescent moon. The crowd is divided into two teams, competing to hit a ball. First, two posts are erected at the south of the polo field, and a board is placed on top, with a hole opened in the bottom as a gate, and a net is added. Whoever wins the ball and hits it into the net bag wins. Or two gates are erected facing each other at both ends, and they push each other, and whoever exits the gate wins. The ball is small, like a fist, hollowed out from light and tough wood and painted red. After the game, a banquet is given, and this is done every year."

These were all land-based feasts during the fifth day of the fifth month. During the Song Dynasty, there were also dragon boat races.

"In the fifth month of the third year of the Xianping reign of Emperor Zhenzong of Song, he visited Jinming Pond to watch water performances. Flags were waved, drums were beaten, and the left and right wings were divided. Trees were planted and tied with colored silk to serve as markers. Square boats advanced quickly, and the first to arrive was rewarded. He moved to Qionglin Garden, ascended the open-air terrace, and played music. Hundreds of performances gathered below the terrace, and all those present were drunk."

During the Shaoxing period of Emperor Gaozong of Song, fans and scarves were always given to officials and Jin envoys during the Dragon Boat Festival. From this, it can be seen that the Dragon Boat Festival was indeed about enjoyment. Saying that it was about mourning Qu Yuan is just one explanation.

"Duan" means beginning. It also means head. May is built on noon, hence it is called Duanwu. In terms of seasons, it is good to take the odd-numbered months and days as seasonal festivals, such as the first day of the first month as New Year's Day, the third day of the third month as Shangsi, the fifth day of the fifth month as Duanwu, also written as Duanwu, the seventh day of the seventh month as Qiqiao, and the ninth day of the ninth month as Chongyang. I was also born on the fifth day of the fifth month, and my nickname is Duansheng. I also sometimes signed myself as "Duan Gong." Later, I learned that it was the title of the Imperial Censor Grandee. Because the Imperial Censor was in the台, he was called御史大夫为台端"Grandee of the Imperial Censor" (now, in letters, commonly written as台端), and he was called "Duan Gong." I knew the reason, so I stopped using the signature.

### Typhus Epidemic

In the past month, more cases of typhoid fever and typhus have been discovered. Typhus has reached epidemic levels, with the number of cases discovered being about double that of April. A total of 3,124 deaths of Chinese have been recorded, including 1,745 exposed corpses. There were 98 requests to the Hygiene Department for treatment of rabies. The school medical services run by the bureau continue as usual. 263 students suffer from trachoma. Officials were dispatched to investigate 264 privately-run Chinese schools receiving subsidies. It was found that 30 of them were fully compliant with the requirements of the Department of Medical Health, and 6 schools are able to find ways to improve facilities. All vegetable markets operate as usual. 467,116 citizens received free vaccinations last month, compared to 105,879 in April. The reason for the sudden increase is that proof of vaccination is required to purchase rice. Work to eradicate mosquitoes and flies is being intensified. In view of the approaching summer, the Hygiene Department has paid close attention to factories producing beverages to stress sanitation. British domestic servant

### Stealing a Huge Sum from the Master

Liu Zhilin, 28 years old, from Fengtian, a domestic servant of British man Bolunte, an employee of the HSBC Bank residing at 1175 Avenue Foch, took advantage of his master's absence between the 26th and 28th of last month, sneaking into the room and stealing US$320 in bills, $100 in savings certificates, and several thousand old French francs, totaling 14,749 yuan, before fleeing. When the master returned home and discovered the theft, he reported it to the police, who arrested Liu and recovered the original stolen US$10 in bills and the $100 in savings certificates. The rest of the money could not be recovered. Taken to the police station, Liu confessed that the missing money had been lost in gambling dens in Nanshi and he had no ability to return it. The police chief ordered him to be detained pending investigation and verification.

### "Dragon vs. Tiger" Premieres Today

"Dragon vs. Tiger," a martial arts romance film, premieres tonight at the Huguang Grand Theatre. The female lead is Ms. Bai Mei, whose beauty and artistic talent are exceptional. The male lead, Xu Cong, has a long history in the film industry and has acted in many films. The plot of "Dragon vs. Tiger" is also well-suited to the tastes of the Chinese people. It tells the story of a young man who strives for progress but, due to the decline of his family, seeks help from his fiancee's father. This old man, a staunch believer in power and money, despises the young man for his poverty and secretly orders his servant to murder him in the middle of the night, hoping to renege on the marriage. The daughter learns of the matter and is greatly displeased, so she helps the young man escape to the capital to take the imperial examination and kills the servant. Fearing punishment, the daughter also disguises herself as a man and flees to the capital. At the martial arts arena, she meets the young man again. The young man, with his high martial arts skills, passes the exam and becomes the martial arts champion. He returns home in glory, and the old man is awestruck. He sets up a banquet and completes the marriage. Lovers finally become husband and wife. The plot is twisted and bizarre, depicting the superficiality of human relationships and the fickleness of the world, which is infuriating.

The Shanghai Bodeh Society, located at 8 Wenzhou Road, at the intersection of Avenue Road, recently requested its chairman, Yuan Ludeng, and famous painter Chen Shengyuan and his students to collaborate on calligraphy and painting fans to raise funds for medical care and free education. The funds raised will be used entirely for the above expenses. Since the opening of the exhibition on June 1, the remaining fans were all ordered within ten days. Later visitors were disappointed, and requests for an extension or orders have flooded in. In response to the requests from all sectors, the society has extended the exhibition. Those who wish to obtain the calligraphy of Mr. Yuan or the paintings of Mr. Chen can immediately go to order them.

Yesterday's newspaper release time was 6:40 PM. Weekend League officially begins.

### Public Debt Ding Category Rebounds Vigorously

The unofficial market for public debt continued to trend upward yesterday. Category Ding rebounded particularly strongly. People were still solely focused on buying, and the bullish side pushed prices up even more. Categories Yi and Bing briefly exceeded the 40-yuan mark. However, forward selling gradually revived. Once the remaining stock is sold out, it is expected that there will be a new initiative. Currently, the public debt market is fortunate to still be a free market. Yesterday, the selling side was mostly Tongli, while Hongxing, Lianyi, Xinji, Hongda, Wuhuo, and Runde also liquidated quite a bit. However, the buying side did not mind, and companies like Jiufeng Changji bought enthusiastically. Tongsheng, Chengkang, Shuntai, Qianyi, Shilong, and Tongkang all bought in, holding onto their old ideas and solely focusing on buying. This may not be a well-rounded plan. As a result, market prices uniformly increased by one to three yuan and six jiao. Approximately 2.7 to 2.8 million yuan worth of transactions took place. A simplified table is listed below (today is the Dragon Boat Festival holiday).

Category | Highest | Lowest | Closing | Compared to Previous Day
------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | --------
Unified A | 43.0 | 42.1 | 43.00 | Up 1.00
Unified B | 0.50 | 18.4 | 40.40 | Up 1.90
Unified C | 41.00 | 38.50 | 40.60 | Up 2.10
Unified Ding | 37.70 | 35.50 | 37.60 | Up 3.60
Unified E | 3.0 | 28.90 | Up 1.90

### Chinese Stocks Fluctuate, Foreign Stocks Generate an Unofficial Market

The trend of Chinese stocks remained flat, fluctuating within a narrow range. Transactions in the financial sector were limited, with Jiaotong Bank shares trading around 145 yuan. Textile stocks were quiet. The prices for each category are listed below:

Category | Highest | Lowest | Final
------- | -------- | -------- | --------
New Asia | 51.00 | 48.00 | 49.50
Sino-French | 95.00 | 92.50 | 95.00

### Cotton Cloth Market Firm and High

The market for factory-produced cloth was firm and high yesterday. All types of cloth continued to rise in price. 16-pound Globe coarse cloth was 205 yuan, Flying Swan 202 yuan, 9-pound New Character 124 yuan, 8-pound Zhenzhong 123 yuan, 12-pound Globe fine cloth 184 yuan, Dapeng New Single 175 yuan, Fugui 180 yuan, Fugui fine twill 162 yuan, Peach Blossom Lady Lin Chen opened at 302 yuan, midday closed at 304 yuan, and the evening closed rose to 305 yuan, an increase of 4 yuan per bolt compared to the previous day. Magnolia bleached cloth was 182 yuan, Qin Liangyu 175 yuan, Longevity Prefecture Silk 6.5 yuan, and Volleyball 4.4 yuan, all showing remarkable strength.

Eastern cloth also remained firm, showing a tendency to rise despite expectations of a fall. 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth New Single opened at 222 yuan, fluctuating for a long time. Ultimately, due to a lack of sellers, it strengthened further at the close. The midday closing price was 225 yuan, and the opening price was 226 yuan, an increase of approximately 3 yuan. Bank order 86 yuan, and Colored Ball fine cloth 195 yuan, were both extremely scarce. Four Gentlemen Serge opened at 8.29 yuan, the midday closing was 8.37 yuan, also up 9 fen.

### Rainproof Cloth Sells Well Timely

Due to the exhaustion of imported raincoat materials from the East and West, the sales of locally produced rainproof cloth have long been boosted. For the selection of Chinese and Western raincoats, nineteen out of twenty invariably choose this material. All tailors shops in Shanghai, big and small, equip themselves with it, which also shows its popularity and strong sales. Recently, the market is very short of goods, and prices are rising. The active sales have led to demand exceeding supply. Upon investigation, there are only two formal manufacturers of rainproof cloth: Yousheng and Rentai. Most of their products are busy delivering orders, so those who want goods mostly go to Xiang Sheng, Rongchangde, Dachangxing and other established stores to redeem orders. Yesterday, Yousheng Yu Xiong old brand sold for 27 yuan per yard, Fu Chou Pao Po Lin 33 yuan, Rentai Orangutan Tarzan rainproof cloth number one 18 yuan, number two 25 yuan, Baobielin 35 yuan.

### New Broad Beans Arrive Sparsely, Sales Prices Soar by More Than Ten Yuan

Bean transactions were reduced yesterday due to the proximity of the holiday. Only a few retail sales were made. However, sellers remained eager to sell, and the market continued to show a firm rise. New broad beans, arriving sparsely and selling actively, soared by more than ten yuan. Red beans also rose by one or two yuan. For example, 30 packages of Hongqiao new green broad beans were priced at 170 yuan to 171.5 yuan. More than 100 packages of Tianjin red beans were priced at 185 yuan to 180 yuan. 20 packages of Chongming sand red beans were priced at 191 yuan.

Due to the gradual arrival of corn from various roads, people suddenly became pessimistic, and prices fell back by more than ten yuan. For example, two carts of Chuzhou corn were priced at 123 yuan to 120 yuan. Two carts of Wuhu corn were priced at 118 yuan to 119 yuan.

Soybean cake transactions were lackluster yesterday. Stockpiling sales were flat and weak. The market was mixed, and prices fluctuated slightly by one or two yuan. For example, 500 pieces of Li Zi brand April new warehouse order were priced at 57.5 yuan. 500 pieces of Feng Ji brand May new warehouse order were priced at 59 yuan. 1,000 pieces of Sheng Ji brand June old warehouse order were priced at 52 yuan to 51.5 yuan, and 500 pieces of February warehouse order were priced at 53 yuan, and 500 pieces of April new warehouse order were priced at 58 yuan. The exchange rate for silver remained unchanged.

### The Exchange Rate for Silver Remains Unchanged

Yesterday, Daxin, a major silver firm, quoted the exchange rate for standard silver at 18 yuan per tael, unchanged. The black market price for operators to buy and sell was 16 yuan and 15 yuan. Silver coins slightly rose by five jiao to nine yuan per coin. The exchange rate for gold jewelry also remained at 2,700 yuan per tael, unchanged (purchase price reduced by 300 yuan). The black market price rose from 2,456 yuan to around 2,490 yuan per tael, also showing a slight increase. It was said to be 2,500 yuan in the afternoon.

### Foreign Currencies Show No Significant Fluctuations

Yesterday, the foreign currency market saw the British and American gold pounds rise to 5,790 yuan. US dollar notes remained around 38 yuan. Hong Kong notes rose to 4.45 yuan. Military notes were around 5.5 yuan.

Yesterday, the interbank lending rate of the Money Trade Association remained at 1 jiao and 8 fen. The new exchange rate was flat, with a hidden premium of about 10 yuan per 1,000 yuan still required. The buying and selling price of Central Reserve Bank notes and old currency was said to be 1.58 yuan and 1.02 yuan.

### Sugar Prices Continue to Rise

Recently, as military notes have not fluctuated much, sugar prices have stabilized accordingly. However, sugar stocks have fluctuated. Yesterday, the market price of coarse granulated sugar was 305 yuan, slightly lower than the previous day, while the price of red granulated sugar was tighter at 295 yuan. Because the cooperation office has not yet completed the adjustment and management procedures for the sugar distributed to other merchants this month, it is feared that it will not be possible to distribute it within the month. As for the price, they are currently consulting with the authorities, and it will probably increase somewhat, because other commodities have already risen sharply, and expenses have also increased.

### Green Bamboo Shoots Arrive on the Market

The first batch of green bamboo shoots and bamboo shoot skins have arrived, with more than 80 pieces of dried bamboo shoots and only a few pieces of bamboo shoot skins. Yesterday, the opening price was: raw bamboo shoot skins were priced at 900 yuan per dan (a unit of weight), cooked bamboo shoot skins at 1,400 yuan, bald shoots at 18 yuan per basket, and fat shoots at 21 yuan per basket. Early yuan bamboo shoots were not yet available. Upon investigation, last year's price for bamboo shoot skins was 370 yuan, and the price for dried bamboo shoots was 6.3 yuan to 6.5 yuan, which is incomparable.

### Tangerine Peel Stores Raise Prices Across the Board

Recently, there has been a lack of continued arrivals of tangerine peel. Only a dozen or so pieces are in stock. Store prices have risen by about 100 yuan compared to the old prices. Due to the scarcity of arrivals and inventory, the store prices are inevitably tighter. Yesterday, the market price rose by 50 yuan.

### Cigarettes and Soap Candles: Market Remains Calm

Regarding the market conditions for cigarettes and daily necessities, yesterday, the market resumed normal business after the previous day's trading prices came to a halt. The market conditions for foreign factory goods were slightly more active, while Japanese cigarettes remained stable as usual. Because it was the Dragon Boat Festival holiday and the half-year closing period for the banking industry, transactions were quite slow. The prices quoted were: British brand 18,300 yuan, Old Knife brand 12,000 yuan, Pin brand 9,500 yuan, Fairy brand 8,500 bolts, Five Flowers brand 8,100 yuan, Japanese cigarette Golden Gun brand 3,320 yuan, Golden Mansion brand 4,800 yuan, Red Rose brand 1,900 yuan, Quanlu brand 4,350 yuan, Compass brand 3,200 yuan, National cigarette Golden Mouse brand 4,500 yuan, and Beauty brand 7,300 yuan. There were no dramatic increases or decreases. The market prices for matches, candles, and soaps were similar to the previous day.

### Closing Accounts for the Dragon Boat Festival, Cement and Steel Bars Have Even Fewer Transactions

Sales of 40-foot steel bars have been sluggish recently. The construction industry in Shanghai has plummeted, and the livelihood of foreign customers is also poor. In addition, due to the Dragon Boat Festival, buyers have temporarily suspended the purchase of hardware, so transactions have been even scarcer. However, the industry remains unwilling to soften its stance, and the standard prices for all goods remain at their original levels. Yesterday, 3/4-inch colored cement steel bars sold for 8,200 yuan per ton, while 5/8-inch to 1-inch goods sold for around 8,000 yuan. Galvanized iron wire sold for 550 yuan per dan, and the new price also opened at 550 yuan. Old Bear Steel and Double Horse Steel were 700 yuan per box. Various soft and hard round, square, and flat wires were sold for 8,000 yuan per ton. Various thicknesses and sizes of shear iron were also sold for 8,000 yuan. Black iron sheets, numbers 12 to 14, were priced at 10,000 yuan per ton, number 20 at 11,000 yuan per ton, and Daguan skin at 14,000 yuan.

### Money Trade Reserve Bank Allows All Banks to Transfer Float into Cash Account via Transfer, Unable to Transfer Back to Cash Float Deposit Account, Interest Accrual Temporarily Postponed

Yesterday, the Money Trade United Reserve Bank announced to member banks: According to the decision of the bank's executive committee, if banks need to transfer floats, they can transfer them to cash accounts. However, once transferred, they cannot be transferred back to the cash account from the float account. Records will be kept. If banks need to transfer from cash accounts to float accounts, please come and contact us. A portion of the float deposits received by the bank were originally transferred from the Central, China and Jiaotong Banks. Since these three banks suspended operations after December 8th of last year, the interest on the deposits has not yet been settled. The interest on all banks' float current accounts deposited with the bank, from January 1942 to the end of June, should also be temporarily postponed.

### Inside the Laboratory

— Yun

These past few days, the work in the laboratory has been quite busy, with a lot of testing to do: urine, stool, sputum, blood, pus, and other bodily fluids. These many colorful and beautiful treasures are indeed our important materials.

The director hasn't arrived yet, so I'll start by testing the urine, which is a common and relatively easy task.

Don't underestimate these things. If you spill them, it's truly worse than death. Would you be embarrassed to ask the patient for another sample? The responsibility of [careful work] must be absolutely followed. Wearing a white lab coat, this place is a small battlefield for spreading various germs. We should rather believe that the enemy is cruel and ruthless, and not think that we are omnipotent. If we are careless, then we are in trouble.

Do you think that urine is all yellow? If you put more than a dozen bottles in a row, wouldn't they look just like the colorful ice soda sold by vendors on the street? Light yellow, orange-yellow, slightly red, brown, grass-green, red, black, milky white, white. But you must not despise its smell. You must wave your hand and smell it, then pour it into a measuring cup to measure the specific gravity. The heavier it is, the worse it is. There are really many variations in urine. Drop the last drop of sedimented urine onto a glass slide and look under a microscope. How many white blood cells, red blood cells, kidney tubules, cylindrical bodies, mucus threads, and epithelial cells are there? Are there any parasites? The crystals are the most interesting. Some look like the pyramids of Egypt, and some look like the exquisite rhinestones that women love. But in reality, they are nothing more than uric acid, oxalic acid, phosphate, calcium carbonate, and so on.

Next, a qualitative test is performed. Add some chemical reagents to test for the presence of acetic acid, diacetic acid, urobilinogen, bile pigment, and even lead, mercury, and arsenic.

If everyone's urine could be tested for sugar, we could set up a sugar shop and sell sweet sugar. This is, of course, a joke. Diabetes is so painful! Sometimes, patients specifically request to test for protein, which is sad for their kidneys. If there is protein, they must be treated properly.

After the director comes to work, the work inevitably becomes more tense.

Testing the blood now. First, determine the percentage of hemoglobin, then count the total number of red blood cells and the total number of white blood cells under a microscope. Then, perform a differential count on a glass slide: total number of neutrophils, total number of lymphocytes, total number of monocytes, and number of platelets. Abnormal pathological red blood cells and white blood cells, too little pigment, malaria protozoa, or relapsing fever spirochetes may be found. We can imagine that the patient is having a high fever, or yellow skin, shivering with cold.

In addition, blood type tests are performed. Use a weak magnification objective lens to examine the agglutination phenomenon of blood cells mixed with known blood sera, and record the results. Thus, there are types O, A, B, and AB. People of type A can receive blood. Among them, only type O is fortunate. He (or she) can donate blood to people of any blood type and can also receive blood of any blood type without restriction. If other different blood types receive incompatible blood, then it is like a bomb meeting fire, and everyone will perish in an instant, and there will be a danger to life. In Europe and the United States, almost everyone has had their blood type tested, which is much more convenient.

Blood can also be tested for the Kahn test or the Wassermann test, which is very useful in cities. It is specifically designed to test people with syphilis. Some couples want to get divorced and often accuse each other of having this disease. Some also hire wet nurses and are not comfortable with her health. Some do it for the convenience of diagnosis, so we have to check. The 100,000 blood drawn from the vein, if there is not enough time to do it that day, must be frozen in an electric refrigerator. Because this procedure is quite cumbersome, in addition to taking out the clotted blood, it must also be shaken in a centrifuge for ten minutes, only to get the serum. Thus, the glass tubes on the copper frame come out from one row to another, and are mixed, sucked, shaken, and incubated many times. Finally, when it is done, we shout out a positive reaction! Or a negative reaction!

The business of stool is mostly taken care of by children, probably because they like to eat snacks. But we also eagerly search for a few tapeworm eggs or roundworm eggs, etc., as if it is very interesting.

Sputum is a mess. To the naked eye, it is nothing more than a thick yellow sputum or a clear, watery white foam. But when you put it on a slide and look under a microscope, you will be really scared. Some dust in the air forms a few handfuls of messy straw placed in a pile of mud. Moving the glass slide and looking again, there are influenza bacilli, which is not so important. Unfortunately, many TB (tuberculosis bacilli) small rods are found, lying horizontally and vertically in the pile of grass, mixed with a few blood cells. This ghost thing is taking away so many [achievements] of the world!

Culturing bacteria should be the most sacred work. We don't care about the sweating. The windows and doors are tightly closed, and no flying insects are allowed inside. Everyone should sit or stand as they please. The air must be absolutely still. Gently apply the bacteria to be cultured (from pus or other bodily fluids) to the culture medium. After 24 hours, take it out of the incubator. The air must also be kept still. The culture medium in the glass container is already full of extremely evil bacteria that devour human life. Sometimes we are culturing typhoid bacteria, or diphtheria bacteria, pyogenic streptococci of septicemia, gonococci, and other bacteria. When we discard them, we immediately implement strict disinfection methods to destroy them.

The easy part is drawing blood from goats and Dutch piglets (for antitoxin purposes). Goats are the most obedient. With a few kind words, they lie down gently and let us do whatever we want. Piglets are always uncooperative, humming and screaming. We have to get them drunk with alcohol, but in reality, it doesn't take much, just a few dozen drops.

Sometimes we are like the chief cooks, arbitrarily cutting fresh beef, blood-red pig lungs, and large pieces of pig liver. After weighing, we put them on agar, cook them and steam them, disinfect them, and put them in bottles. It turns out that this is to make a large amount of culture medium for use at any time.

After the reports of each test are issued, the day is over. Dragging our tired bodies, we leave the laboratory.

### I Have Lung Disease – Another Side of Life –

— Luo Chen

The doctor said that my lung disease is already in the second stage.

The other day, a friend in Free Talk said: If you have lung disease, don't worry! But how can this keep me from worrying?

Don't worry? – Yes, I know that although the medical community has not yet invented a completely specific medicine for lung disease today, people are not completely helpless against lung disease. I know I have to take cod liver oil, I know I have to inject calcium, I know I have to drink milk, eggs, and beef broth, I know I have to get plenty of rest... but how can I do all of this?

Every day, I have to get up early and walk half an hour to school. You say, "Why not take the bus? Walking will make your illness worse." But do you know that the tram has increased its price again? I can't afford to take the bus. Once at school, I have to strain my throat from morning to night, spending a full eight hours hoarsely screaming. The elementary school students are shouting and making noise, preventing you from having a moment of peace. On the one hand, I also have to watch the headmaster's face. Every time I see the students being active, I feel sad – how wonderful it would be if I could go back to that carefree and innocent childhood!

Coming home, I am completely exhausted. I cough. I feel a dull pain in my chest. Looking in the mirror, I find myself getting thinner day by day. On my prominent cheekbones, two red patches of lung disease appear. I'm afraid! I threw down the mirror and buried my head in my palms – Ah! I have lung disease! A consumptive ghost!

Take a break! I told myself that I can't go on like this. I went to see the doctor. The doctor complained: Why didn't you come earlier? If you had come two months earlier, things would have been much easier! Yes, why didn't I come earlier? Oh no, why did I come at all? I knew I had lung disease, two months ago – three months ago I also knew that I must have lung disease, why did I go to see a doctor? The doctor, of course, said, "Don't worry, rest well!" That's right, rest! But as soon as I get home, I see my wife's bitter face, and the children are opening their mouths and shouting, "We're hungry!"

Don't worry? How can I not worry? I have to take cod liver oil, but the children need to eat!

### Ten Thousand People's Slave

— Lü Shuhui

(1) I am a waiter in a restaurant

Humans, individuals, exist in the world, perhaps as the ancients said: "A leaf on a big tree, a grain in a granary"? However, viewed in this way, humans are quite insignificant. Maybe people will never know that such a grain or a leaf exists – unless that person can be recognized by the world and appears in historical records; then, he can be considered an extraordinary person – an extraordinary grain, a leaf. But how can you be discovered by the people of the world and leave a name for eternity? I don't know these "ways to rise in society," but if you want to wash away your shadow from the minds of the people in society, or become an ordinary and mediocre person, so that they simply don't know you exist, then I can dutifully reply to you: "Please go and be a waiter in a restaurant!"

"What, isn't being a waiter a decent profession? Are they really never recognized or discovered by the people of society? You're being too dismissive of them!" Perhaps someone might ask me in surprise like this. But, alas! I am not being dismissive of them, just as I am not being dismissive of myself. Perhaps this is because onlookers see more clearly, but our lives, environment, and difficulties cannot be understood by those "not in the situation!"

In a restaurant, if you want to become someone who "eats well, knows food, is clever (falsely intelligent), and learns to be lazy" (these are the buzzwords in the restaurant industry), then that's very easy. It's exactly "If you want to learn the language of Chu, you must go to Chu!" But if you want to learn to be a "top scholar" in a restaurant, perhaps there are one or two who will become world-famous, but in the past, I dare say it has never been heard of.

If you want to find a way out, then you must "start your own business!" Why? I cannot list them one by one. In short, restaurants only "bury talent" and do not "cultivate talent." This is the source of its illness in a nutshell.

Working in a restaurant, to put it nicely, is "serving the public." To put it bluntly, it is being a "slave to ten thousand people." But this is not enough to be its illness.

I am "in the situation," of course, I know more details. Although I don't have much "experience," three years is enough! In that long – or short, in the eyes of others – process, I have gained many lessons. I have uncovered the secrets of the inner layers of society, and I recognize this difficult life where one cannot survive without striving and struggling! (End of first part)

Invention

### Five-Person Bicycle

— Zhang Qiao

The bicycles in Shanghai are truly diverse and strange. However, a five-person bicycle seems to be unheard of. This can truly be said to be one strong hand among many strong hands; the world is so big, and there are many strange and bizarre things. This five-person bicycle is actually made up of three bicycles. It is simply impossible for five people to ride one bicycle. Among these three bicycles, one has front and rear seats. This creates four seats, and the other person sits in the front row in the helmsman's seat. Four people drive the bicycle, and one person controls the direction. But I don't know if this novel vehicle will appear on the Shanghai Bund.

### Miscellaneous Words

— Jimi

Nearsighted people need a pair of glasses to correct their shortsightedness. However, there are even more invisible nearsighted people in the world! They all lack the vision of farsighted people.

The wind is too flying, and the mountain is too still, but they are both stronger than the floating clouds.

Do you prefer a fresh flower blooming in a beautiful garden for people to admire, or blooming in a desolate desert to comfort the lonely released prisoner?

### Errors

— Zheng Zheng

In all sciences, error precedes truth.

Sometimes we learn more from a person's mistakes than from their virtues.

To not make mistakes is beyond human ability, but the wise often learn from their errors and use them for future wisdom.

Honest errors should be pitied, not ridiculed.

Animals

### Dancing Mice

— Dong Kang

Dancing mice are a strange kind of animal. Their physiology is the same as ordinary mice. When they dance, they circle around and around very quickly, for a long time, perhaps a few minutes. Sometimes they stand on their hind legs and jump a few times, or circle in a large circle. If there is an obstacle in their way as they circle, it will not stop them from dancing. They will find another place and continue to dance. Dancing mice have great perseverance. Even if they jump out of the cage, they will dance again after a short rest, so people can catch them again.

American biologist Helen Dicken conducted an experiment in which she crossed several generations of wild mice and bred several dancing mice. Before this, the biologist had bred several generations of white mice, a total of five thousand, but none of them could dance. Now, in their same generation, there are a total of seventy-four siblings, two males, and one female who can waltz.

Male dancing mice are very irritable and prone to fighting with their own kind. The females are more gentle and can live peacefully with other female mice, but if a strange dancing mouse mixes in, they will kill the newcomer together. Their reproductive capacity is weak, and their breeding period is short.

Dancing mice eat a lot, and even their offspring who do not dance eat more than ordinary mice. There is a type of dancing mouse with neurosis that eats even more and drinks a lot of water. Their front paws often make the same movements repeatedly, and their character is very similar to that of dancing mice.

Nature

### Mysterious Ozone

— Shi Dong

Ozone, oxygen, and water vapor coexist in the atmosphere that covers the Earth's surface to a height of one hundred and forty miles. If we did not have these three gases, the Earth's temperature would tend to extremes, so that summer would make us die of heat, and winter would make us freeze to death.

Ozone is most effective at a distance of seventy to one hundred miles from the Earth's surface. Here it forms a layer that absorbs the ultraviolet rays emitted by the sun, preventing them from shining on us with full force. If ultraviolet rays did not pass through this layer and shone on us with full force, then I would not be here writing this article, and you would not be here reading it!

But our friend ozone is doing double duty. On the one hand, it prevents heat from shining directly on the Earth, and on the other hand, it prevents too much heat from escaping from the Earth. If heat could escape freely from the Earth, then after the sun sets, the temperature would suddenly drop to hundreds of degrees below zero.

In carrying out this important work, ozone has a good helper, which is dust. Any ultraviolet rays that the ozone layer cannot absorb are filtered down by dust, so that we can obtain a moderate temperature. It also regulates the movement of clouds and the evaporation of water.

If there were no dust to hinder it, large amounts of water vapor would be absorbed into the air, causing rivers, lakes, and oceans to dry up. Then this large amount of water would fall violently on the earth, causing huge floods, and we would all drown.

### Thornless Rose

— Bi Geng

The color of the rose is the most beautiful and the most sweet, but it has sharp thorns, making it loved but not easy to get. Poets say: The rose is a symbol of love, which is indeed accurate. Thornless roses have been dreamed of by gardeners for hundreds of years but have not yet been achieved. Recently, it has been successfully cultivated by a gardener named Ge Li in Connecticut, USA. He has therefore won the honor of being a rose planting expert. This peculiar rose was accidentally discovered a year ago. Now, its young buds are grafted onto the roots of other roses. Then it is placed in a warm and airtight incubator for six weeks, and then transplanted into a pot of soil in a flower room to grow.

A thornless rose has been discovered, but who has discovered a thornless love?

### Sharing the Same Boat Through Wind and Rain

— He Jia Zhi

(6) In the Blink of an Eye

Wei Cheng's biological mother was gone, and his aunt was his mother. His mother did not want him to do this, but he insisted on doing it, which was really too much. He looked at his aunt's face and then at his mother's portrait, and could not bear to mention going to Shanghai again. From that day on, he set a daily schedule, writing in a diary, reading, writing, and inspecting the acres of land, these essential courses, noted on it. Inspecting the acres of land meant checking the crops in the fields. During his inspection time, he would either look east or look west. Westward, was where the person he cared about was, looking at the clouds in the sky, perhaps that cloud was above Guo Fang and Sister Cui Zhen. Eastward, was where Cui Zhen would return from, that must be from the east.

Two days later, Cui Zhen returned. Wei Cheng was writing in his diary when he heard the sound. He quickly put down his pen and went out to greet her, then walked ahead to lead her in. Madam Ye the Second, Magpie, and He Ma all surrounded her and asked questions. Wei Cheng saw that Cui Zhen's face was whiter than when she had left, and even her standing and sitting postures had changed. On the table were the canned foods and five-pound boxes of biscuits she had brought back. He thought that these things were undoubtedly sent by Guo Fang. Guo Fang herself liked to eat biscuits and sweets, and she thought of sending people these things by judging others by herself. He suddenly heard his aunt saying, "If you didn't come back, Brother Cheng was going to come to Shanghai to find you. He thinks about you every day." Her words seemed to remind Wei Cheng and also gave him a chance to talk to Cui Zhen, so he quickly asked, "Sister Cui Zhen, did you come back on Zhang Shu Rong's boat?" Cui Zhen said, "Yes. Miss Chen personally sent me to the pier and also sent many things. This time, she spent a lot of money. The ship arrived late today. When it arrived at Hua Gang, Zhang Shu Rong wanted to send the boat back to get me, but I said that I had only been to Shanghai once, so how could I be so delicate? He also wanted to help me carry things, but I didn't want him to, so I walked back. Miss Chen didn't want me to leave yet and wanted to wait for Brother Cheng to come and pick me up, but I said that if Brother Cheng came out, Second Aunt would be even more lonely, so I didn't want him to come out." Wei Cheng said, "How many days did Sister Cui Zhen stay in Shanghai?" Cui Zhen said, "About seven or eight days. I wanted to come back every day." Madam Ye the Second urged Qin Zhen to go eat, interrupting the siblings' conversation. (105)
