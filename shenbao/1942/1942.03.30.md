Rome, 29th (Reuters) - Rome Radio reported yesterday that a major British fleet, including two battleship-type combat ships, two aircraft carriers, several cruisers, and numerous auxiliary vessels, passed the Cape of Good Hope yesterday and headed for the Indian Ocean.

Tokyo, 29th (Reuters) - According to frontline reports, Japanese forces are continuing to clear out remaining resistance on the Andaman Islands in the Bay of Bengal, Indian Ocean, and have occupied nearby islands on the 25th of this month, capturing 23 British officers and 300 Indian soldiers.

Melbourne, 29th (Reuters) - Following his appointment as Commander-in-Chief of the Army, General Blamey has immediately reorganized the Australian Military Command to connect with the Supreme Command. General Blamey also plans to meet with General Macarthur, the Supreme Commander of the Southwest Pacific, in the coming days.

London, 28th (Reuters) - British sources believe that India is now feeling the threat from the sea, and the pressure from Burma is also increasingly significant. The Japanese are currently obstructing the Allied sea lanes in the Indian Ocean. The Japanese have expanded their navy to certain islands, and their ships have been transferred to Rangoon. Submarines are now active off the coast of Madras. The Japanese are taking advantage of the lull in the Australian campaign, constantly preparing for a blitzkrieg attack from the mine-laden area of Salomo against Port Moresby, Thursday Island, the base in northern Queensland, and other islands within the Torres Strait. Several airfields and bomber bases between Rabaul and Lae have been utilized by the Japanese. Their aircraft and ground troops are dispersed to various locations to prevent bombing by the Australian Air Force. According to unconfirmed Axis sources, the Japanese have seized the ××××× archipelago and the ××× archipelago between the ××× and ××××× archipelagos, which will be used as bases for attacking the industrial areas of the southeastern coast of Australia, and are planning to use them to cut off the supply lines between the United States and Australia.

### Axis Powers to Launch Spring Offensive in April; Frequent Political and Military Activities

London, 28th (Reuters) - Well-informed British sources are speculating that when the Axis powers launch their spring offensive, Japanese forces will simultaneously attack Siberia. This speculation is based on the melting of ice and snow in the Soviet Union and Siberia, and the intensification of political and military activities on various battlefields. It is generally expected that the Axis offensive will be launched in April, as Hitler's invasion of Norway began in April 1940, and his invasion of Yugoslavia and Greece began in April 1941. British sources believe that the Soviet Union will be fighting on two fronts this spring. Hitler is using both threats and inducements, hoping that King Boris of Bulgaria will provide 500,000 troops for his use, replacing the German troops tied down in Yugoslavia and Greece, so that they can fight in the Soviet Union. Pro-Soviet sentiment is very strong among the Bulgarian people. Regarding whether Hitler will pass through Turkey to attack the Middle East, there are conflicting rumors from the outside world.

London, 28th (Reuters) - Military commentators report that both the Allies and the Axis powers are consolidating their forces on battlefields around the world in preparation for future battles. With the exception of Burma, there are no major battles on other fronts. On the Soviet front, the Soviet forces are trying to consolidate the gains of their hard-fought battles. Although the period of melting ice and snow has begun, the Soviet forces still seem to have the opportunity to continue operations, although the difficulty has increased compared to before. Some of the Soviet forces' objectives seem to be showing signs of success, such as the final annihilation of the German 16th Army. However, after the ice and snow melt, the Soviet forces may have to abandon some of the land gained through hard-fought battles. On the other hand, increased activity before the major battle season arrives may allow the Soviet Union to continue to reap some fruits of victory. The next few weeks will be of utmost importance in determining the positions where both sides will concentrate their main forces in the future. In Libya, both sides are reorganizing their manpower and material losses from the hard-fought winter battles. In the Far East, before large-scale battles resume, important strategic work will also be carried out, attempting to cut off the communication between the Chinese army and its allies. The situation now seems to have improved, but there is a lack of reliable information here.

Night Scene of the Mysore Palace in India

The extravagant lifestyle of Indian princes is almost unimaginable to the world. The value of a single piece of clothing can easily equal that of an entire city. Belts and buckles are often carved from whole pieces of jade. The diamonds on their clothing are often strung together in the thousands, which is considered nothing unusual. Mysore, in southern India, is one of the largest cities. It has well-developed industries and a famous dam. The entire city's electricity is generated by it. The city's palace is decorated with electric lights on the exterior. In the evening, the lights are like a painting, resembling a crystal palace.

### Turkey Expresses Strict Neutrality; Bulgarian Prime Minister Delivers Speech in Parliament, Hinting at Readiness to Join War Against Soviet Union

Istanbul, 28th (Havas) - Prominent member of parliament, Sadak, known for representing the views of the government, recently published an article in the "Akşam" newspaper, stating that current indications prove that Turkey is determined to maintain neutrality at any cost, at least to maintain peace until the dark end of 1942. We should unite and prepare to deal with all events that could endanger our neutrality, in order to defend our country. As for the future of the war and its complex relationships, no one can predict it. It is also generally believed here that German-Turkish relations are good. Germany unconditionally supports Turkey's efforts to maintain neutrality. At the same time, Turkish-Bulgarian relations have also greatly improved since the signing of the trade agreement.

Sofia, 28th (Havas) - The Bulgarian Parliament held its closing ceremony today. Prime Minister Filov delivered a speech, stating that "the war will determine the fate of Europe. At this moment, we can no longer stand idly by. Our fate is intertwined with that of the Allied powers and cannot be separated. Although we are not at war, we have encountered various crises that have put us in a state of war. I believe that our people must be prepared to endure all sacrifices and do everything possible to defend the freedom and independence of the country, as in the past, so shall it be in the future. Therefore, we must assist our Allies with all our strength. The path that our country should take has already been determined. If we do not follow this path, we will inevitably go astray and encounter difficulties. In other words, our prosperity and development are inseparable from the new Europe, and the prerequisite for building a new European order is to eliminate Bolshevism, as this is the greatest threat to Europe. As for the tasks that the people of the country will undertake in accordance with the development of the international situation, they are being gradually implemented through the efforts of our army. In short, our duty is to maintain morale, fully utilize domestic resources to increase production, and strive to adapt to this great era. In the past, we have been able to fulfill all our obligations because the King, with his great wisdom and insight, has led everything, and the people of the country have known to center themselves on the King, to support and follow him. We must do the same in the future to deal with the difficulties of the times. I hope to encourage my compatriots together."

### Turkish-Bulgarian Trade Agreement Signed

### Recent Developments on the Soviet Front Indicate That the International Situation Will Have a Decisive Development

New York, 28th (Havas) - Recent developments on the Soviet front indicate that the situation will have a decisive development. According to the opinions of some military experts here, it is easier for the Allied forces to open up a new battlefield in Western Europe, rather than land in northern Russia. There are various phenomena that can be used as confirmation. The Soviet forces have been actively operating on the Murmansk front for months, probably in order to seize the port of Petsamo, so that supplies from Britain and the United States can be landed. Soviet Ambassador to Britain Maisky has stated that if the Allied powers implement aid on the Soviet front, there is hope of victory this year. President Roosevelt recently ordered his subordinates to prioritize the shipment of supplies to the Soviet Union and to intensify general assistance to the Soviet Union.

General Kostenko, Commander-in-Chief of the Southwest Front, and General Lobatin, Commander of the former Ukrainian district, were among those who received medals.

### Soviet Strength Should Not Be Underestimated

(News Agency) - An Italian newspaper commented on the current situation in the Soviet Union, stating that the Soviet Union can no longer rely on the assistance of the Anglo-Saxon countries. However, it would be too early to say that the Soviet Union can be ended within 24 hours after the German forces resume their spring offensive. The Soviet Union is vast and populous, and still has a large number of reserves available for deployment, and stores a large amount of munitions. Its eastern and Siberian industrial areas can also manufacture munitions. The communist government rose after the collapse of the Imperial Russian army, and will not forget the lessons of the last war. It is said that the Tsar's failure was due to the lack of sufficient industrial networks and railway lines, so the Soviet government first paid attention to distributing large industrial areas throughout the Soviet territory to supply abundant coal and iron ore, in order to accumulate a large number of weapons and ammunition to compensate for the consumption of weapons and ammunition.

### Finnish Forces Recapture Hogland Island

Yesterday, about 40 people visited, and he met with 22 of them, making it one of the busiest days for meeting guests. It is scheduled to meet with Gandhi and Nehru again today.

New Delhi, 29th (Reuters) - Acharya Kripalani accompanied Nehru to Cripps' residence at 4:15 PM (Indian Standard Time) today for a fourth meeting with Cripps. It is said that Nehru had breakfast with Cripps this morning.

New Delhi, 29th (United Press) - Cripps met with Gandhi and Nehru today, talking for over two hours. Cripps also met with Jinnah for half an hour, and then received representatives from the Indian National Congress. The Executive Committee of the Congress will meet in the coming days to discuss proposals, and then receive a delegation from Hyderabad, representatives from princely states, and representatives from the Chamber of Princes. It is learned that Cripps' meetings with Indian leaders yesterday have clarified the proposal for the establishment of a new constitutional conference mechanism and a temporary agreement during the reorganization of the government. Representatives of the princes apparently want to know how the situation of the princely states will be improved under the new constitution.

New Delhi, 29th (Reuters) - The Standing Committee of the Indian National Congress held a meeting starting at 4:00 PM today (Indian Standard Time). Political circles believe that this meeting is extremely important, and its outcome will have a significant impact on the future relationship between India and Britain. The meeting was presided over by President Acharya Kripalani, and Gandhi also attended.

New Delhi, 29th (Reuters) - Sir Stafford Cripps met with Gandhi for about half an hour yesterday, and then met with the former prime ministers of the United Provinces and Bombay Province. Afterwards, a journalist asked, "Are you excited, Your Excellency?" Cripps replied, "I am even more excited now."

Saigon, 29th (Haitong) - New Delhi dispatches. Sir Stafford Cripps received a delegation of Indian princes yesterday morning and had a meeting with former Madras Prime Minister Gopalachari at noon.

New Delhi, 28th (Havas) - The special British envoy to India, Sir Stafford Cripps, recently told reporters that he intends to meet with Indian communists. When a reporter said that the Communist Party has always been banned in India, Sir Cripps said, "I will meet with communists individually, and I am very willing to talk to representatives from the Indian women's community and youth, but I have no intention of meeting with representatives from commercial groups." Regarding the British proposal, Sir Cripps is scheduled to explain it at 6:00 PM tomorrow and is scheduled to deliver a radio address the day after tomorrow.

Efforts to Reconcile Opinions Achieve Significant Progress

New Delhi, 28th (United Press) - Cripps has apparently made significant progress on the issue of establishing an agreement on India's future independence. Cripps said that he hopes the final decision can be completed within ten days. Cripps will announce the British Cabinet's proposals for India on the 30th and will meet with Gandhi, Nehru, and other leaders again tomorrow. It is generally believed that Cripps' talks tomorrow are extremely important in Cripps' efforts to reconcile the opinions between the National Congress and the Muslims, because it is known that the opinions of the Muslims are closer to those of the British. How things will proceed in the future largely depends on the next steps of the nationalists and the leaders of the National Congress. It is learned that Cripps has already accepted the suggestions made by Jinnah, the leader of the Muslim League.

India's Future Administrative Structure is Similar to the Nature of the League of Nations

Swiss Capital, 28th (Havas) - The Neue Zürcher Zeitung published a special dispatch from New Delhi this morning, stating that India's future administrative structure is more accurately described as being similar to an international federation than to a federation. At the same time, nationalist leaders currently have two doubts: (1) When will Britain allow India to achieve dominion status? (2) Will India establish a national government and be granted various real powers? In addition, the Muslim League advocates the establishment of a Muslim country based on religion, whose territory includes the prosperous province of Bengal, the western part of the United Provinces, and Agra and Delhi, as well as the provinces of Punjab, Kashmir in the northwest, and Balochistan. This country will be linked to the group of Muslim countries in the future and will expand towards the Middle East. The intention of those who drafted this plan is to avoid Muslims in India being reduced to a minority with deprived religious freedom in a vast federation in the future. As for the various states ruled by Indian princes, they should be left to their own devices.

### Saint-Nazaire, France: British Landing Situation – Destruction of the Sluice Gate as the Primary Mission; Germans Claim British Ships Suffered Heavy Damage

Stockholm, Sweden, 29th (Reuter) – British sources have released details regarding the unsuccessful British landing at Saint-Nazaire, stating that the destroyer HMS "Campbeltown" bore the main responsibility for the attack, tasked with destroying the port's sluice gate. Special marine units were also involved in destroying port facilities. The ship successfully rammed and destroyed the sluice gate. The marines encountered fierce resistance and subsequently withdrew with "slight losses." The troops reportedly returned safely to their original base.

London, 29th (Reuters) – Some of the British forces who participated in the raid on Saint-Nazaire, the French Atlantic port, have landed at a port in Britain. Many were seriously wounded but remained in high spirits. They returned to England this morning on a naval vessel flying a white flag. Ambulances and Red Cross nurses were waiting at the pier. A military band played the national anthem, and the wounded were taken to local hospitals for treatment.

Stockholm, Sweden, 29th (Reuter) – A London dispatch states that the destroyer sunk during the British landing at Saint-Nazaire was the old US destroyer HMS "Campbeltown," transferred to Britain by the US. The ship displaced 2,100 tons, carried twelve torpedo tubes, four 10.2 cm guns, and one 7.6 cm anti-aircraft gun, with a peacetime crew of 122 officers and men.

Stockholm, Sweden, 29th (Reuter) – The British official news agency, Reuters, commented last night on the British landing at Saint-Nazaire, calling it the boldest offensive since the French defeat. However, the British communiqué was conspicuously brief on the matter, which is noteworthy.

German Communiqué

Berlin, 29th (Reuter) – Military circles here consider the British landing a "method of the type of attack of Maikop," akin to the second front in Europe demanded by the Soviet Union. This action, like previous operations on the Western European coast and in Norway, is deemed foolish. Its purpose was evidently to destroy military installations, probe German reactions, or serve as a prelude to a large-scale landing. However, this time the British completely failed; almost all their ships were destroyed, and the landing force was wiped out.

Berlin, 28th (Havas) – Regarding the British attack and landing at Saint-Nazaire, the naval base at the mouth of the Loire River in France, the responsible military authorities here have released the following account. Yesterday at midnight, British aircraft first flew over Saint-Nazaire and dropped several bombs, causing no damage on the ground. The apparent goal of the British aircraft was to divert the attention of the coastal defense forces. While German anti-aircraft batteries were firing at the British aircraft, several small British warships suddenly appeared, attempting to enter the mouth of the Loire River. However, they were detected by the German coastal artillery, which immediately opened fire. This type of attack is identical to the British attack on the German submarine base at Zeebrugge during the last World War. The operation was extremely swift. One group used several fast boats to concentrate at the mouth of the Loire River, while a destroyer led the way, attempting to enter the world-famous Saint-Nazaire lock. However, before reaching the lock gates, the destroyer was hit by a German shell and exploded instantly. Subsequent investigation revealed that this destroyer was originally built in the United States and was one of the fifty destroyers transferred by the US to Britain in exchange for naval bases in the Western Hemisphere. The German coastal artillery aimed accurately, destroying all the small British warships. A small, fast motorboat managed to escape, but while the British fast boats were attacking the port of Saint-Nazaire, some British troops took the opportunity to land. They were met with fierce resistance from the German forces, who cut off their retreat. The landing force scattered into small groups and fled into nearby houses, putting up a desperate fight. Soon order was restored. The British fast boats were repelled, and the landing force was annihilated. When German destroyers pursued, they discovered several British destroyers anchored offshore, observing the progress of the landing battle at the mouth of the Loire River. The German ships immediately fired torpedoes, scoring five direct hits. Only a few enemy ships managed to escape. During the naval battle, a German destroyer spotted a small British motorboat in the mouth of the Loire River, attempting to flee to the open sea. However, under the fire of the German ship, it was forced to stop. The fifteen sailors on board were captured. After the naval battle ended, the small boat was towed away by the German ship.

### An Itinerary of the Indian Peninsula (7)

Indian Wedding

Returning from the hunting trip, we immediately began a thousand-mile journey to the city of Hyderabad in the central part of the Indian Peninsula. This is a large state; England and Scotland combined are not as large, with a population of seventeen million.

Our route south required us to return to Allahabad. The Ganges River there has a stone bridge that could allow our heavily laden vehicle to cross. From there it was flat highway, passing through cities such as Rewa, and Jabalpur. Each day we passed through the borders of several Indian tribes. Lorrain often argued with the border officials because they always wanted to inspect each piece of luggage, which weighed fifteen tons.

After passing Besa, we entered the territory of the Prince of Hyderabad. The customs officials here were extremely polite and immediately allowed us to pass. It turned out that the customs officers had received advance notice from Sir Hyder Jung, the Chief Secretary of the Government Council, and had been waiting for us for a long time. Sir Jung and Lorrain had been corresponding.

Before we prepared to capture the various scenes of the Deccan Plateau on film, we had to fulfill an appointment in the distant northern city of Bikaner. The Prince’s granddaughter was marrying the Prince of Jodhpur, forming a marital alliance between two major Rajput clans. We took the train from Hyderabad to Bombay, a three-day journey. In Bombay, we hired a truck to transport photographic and lighting equipment northward.

On the morning of the 29th, we saw Lorrain, in his morning coat, busy with five days of photographic work, documenting this grand wedding ceremony, the likes of which had rarely been seen in India in recent years. Fourteen princes, each with two to six hundred attendants or friends, came to offer their congratulations. The Bikaner railway station was filled with private carriages. Our friends, the Princes of Jaipur and Jodhpur, arrived by airplane. The whole city was decorated with flags, and the colorful electric lights at night illuminated the city as if it were daytime.

The procession to the palace was like a story from Arabian Nights. Soldiers lined both sides of the street, clearing the way. Behind them were silver carriages pulled by oxen, the oxen pure white and covered with luxurious blankets. Following them were elephants with palanquins decorated with gold and silver. Although the elephants were massive, they seemed to be carrying a great weight. Another elephant, entirely covered in gold cloth with gold and silver decorations on its legs, carried a golden palanquin with the groom moving slowly forward. Next, two elephants, with decorations slightly less ornate than the groom's, carried attendants holding long whisks, fanning the groom’s head.

In the large square of the palace, the Prince of Bikaner and his officials waited for the groom to arrive. The Prince of Jodhpur dismounted the elephant, and the Prince of Bikaner came to greet him. The Prince of Jodhpur then entered a silver palanquin and was carried to the inner hall.

The wedding ceremony lasted four hours, ending at dusk. Except for immediate family members, no outsiders were allowed to watch the ceremony. However, Bethje was specially allowed to watch the wedding from the women’s gallery in the palace. To observe religious etiquette, she left her shoes outside.

The bride was obscured by a group of maidens wearing crimson and silver clothes, unseen. The maidens held a large shawl in front of the bride. Only her hand was visible, holding a long ribbon, the other end of which was held by the groom. Three monks prayed, their voices loud and fast. The Prince sat in a canopy-covered seat above.

During this long wedding ceremony, the princes and friends who came to offer congratulations were entertained by singers and dancers. By nine o’clock in the evening, the palace was brilliantly lit, like a fairyland. The newlyweds sat in a palanquin with gold and silver curtains, the groom in front and the bride behind, completely obscured from view.

A Ten-Year-Old Prince

For us, the next four days were like being in a dream. There were banquets hosted by the royal family every day. We reviewed the Bikaner army and witnessed a demonstration of how imposing the camel corps, which the Prince personally led in the First World War, was. There were also performances of Indian dramas. Dance masters were specially invited from afar to perform dances to entertain the guests.

One night, we had the opportunity to meet the ten-year-old Prince of Mettur, who was very intelligent.

"Madam, I am very honored to dine at the same table with you," he said solemnly. The Prince had dark skin, long, curly black eyelashes, and wore an orange turban. He was not even as tall as Bethje's shoulder. He introduced Bethje to the eight most delicious curries. The Prince spoke of his hunting experiences, which he mostly followed his father to do. Unfortunately, his father passed away the year before last, and the Prince ascended the throne at the age of nine.

"I hope you can come to our country to hunt," he spoke in the same manner as an adult. After the meal, the Prince invited the female guests to another part of the palace to listen to songs. The singing girls, dressed in beautiful orange clothes, sat next to the Prince and sang softly, accompanied by the lute and drums. Indian music sounds monotonous and dry at first, but after listening for a while, it feels unique and quite harmonious. The Prince asked Bethje if she wanted to request a song. She chose a sadder song because the melody seemed more harmonious.

"But this song cannot be sung now," the Prince said. Bethje felt a little strange. The Prince told her, "Every song has a specific time to be sung during the day. Some are for the morning, some for the afternoon, and others can only be sung at night. The one you requested is a morning song, which must wait until one o'clock to be sung.” We were very intrigued by this kind of singing etiquette and waited until one o'clock to hear the song.

The next day, the sixteen-year-old bride bid farewell to her parents and prepared to leave. Flags fluttered at the train station, and the platform was filled with the people of Bikaner, who came to see her off. After the bride boarded the special train, she was separated from her grandfather, and tears flowed. When she saw her English nanny, the nanny was staying in the palace and was not coming. The train waited for an hour, and rushed to welcome the old nanny with white hair. The nanny came to say goodbye to the princess with reddened eyes, talking for fifteen minutes. The band played the state music of Bikaner and Jodhpur, and the train slowly left the station.

How many people can see such a grand scene? And as far as we know, no one has ever had the convenience of photography. In this era full of devastation, when can we see it again? We felt very tired. Fortunately, we could take a short break on the three-day train ride back to Hyderabad.

Varemne, which was previously managed by Hua Lun Shipping Company and leased to the Japanese company Asia Company to sail the Shanghai-Qingdao route, carrying coal. Now that the lease has expired, it has been taken back by the French company and is said to be scheduled to return to Saigon next month. Another Russian ship, the "Food Industry" (translated meaning), is being repaired in Shanghai. The repairs have now been completed, and it will soon return to Vladivostok.

Future Movements of the "Conte Verde"

There is also the Italian mail ship "Conte Verde," which has been docked in Shanghai since the outbreak of the European war in mid-May of the year before last, for a total of twenty months. At the end of last year, there were rumors that the ship would sail to Japan, but it is still docked in the Huangpu River. However, it is said that fuel has been secured, but whether there will be any movement is impossible to ascertain. The company also denies that the mail ship will leave Shanghai. At present, apart from Japanese ships that regularly sail the Yangtze River ports and Southeast Asia (including Hong Kong) on military schedules, once the French and Russian ships leave Shanghai, international commercial shipping in the city will be completely suspended.

The allocation and sale methods, as well as the dates, remain unchanged.

### Subletting a House Without Brother's Consent Leads to Shooting; Fortunately, No Hit

Guo Shangqi, a local resident over fifty years old, whose ancestors started in the construction business, inherited a building they built themselves at No. 623 Qipulu. Last month, on the 24th, at 11:00 PM, his younger brother Yu Zhi, born to the same mother, sublet a downstairs bedroom to a friend surnamed Zhang without the older brother's consent, causing a dispute. The older brother, Guo Shangqi, in a fit of anger, used a self-defense pistol issued by the Public Works Department, and while the younger brother was sound asleep, locked him in the room, drew the pistol, and shot at the younger brother, attempting to take his life. Fortunately, he missed. After the incident, the corresponding Huisi police station was notified. Detectives Feng and Huang rushed to the scene to investigate and confirmed the facts. The pistol and eleven bullets were taken to the police station, and a public prosecution was filed for attempted murder. During the postponement, his daughter Huaiyu pleaded with her uncle Yu Zhi not to pursue the matter and testified in court. Yu Zhi also did not appear in court. The defendant Guo Shangqi insisted that he acted in a moment of anger and sought leniency, stating that he only intended to scare his brother, not to kill him. The verdict is scheduled for April.

### French Concession Launches Disease Prevention, Free Injections Starting Next Month

### Firefighters, Postal Workers Exempt from Civil Defense Corps

It has been learned that patrol officers, detectives, firefighters, and postal workers of the police department are exempt from civil defense corps duty due to their professional responsibilities. However, general staff members of the police department are not included in this exception. As for doctors and others with important duties, they are currently required to serve. Some doctors with busy practices are requesting reconsideration, but the police authorities have not accepted this request.

### Counterfeit "Da Jian Huang" Tablets Tested and Confirmed; Do Not Contain Essential Ingredients; May Delay Treatment and Endanger Lives

The French product "Da Jian Huang" tablets are specially used to treat meningitis, pneumonia, and all types of erysipelas. Due to a shortage of supply, the price of each bottle of twenty tablets has soared to over one hundred gold, yet they are still difficult to purchase. Therefore, Xu Likuan, the owner of the Far East Chemical Pharmaceutical Factory at No. 33 Qingdao Road, imitated the various styles and trademarks of Da Jian Huang and manufactured counterfeit medicine for sale. The manufacturing of these counterfeit drugs

is extremely detailed

and is almost identical to the packaging of genuine products. Without testing, it is difficult to distinguish between genuine and counterfeit. The matter was discovered by Detective Wang Xichang of the Xinzha police station, who arrested Xu and the key staff members of the Far East Pharmaceutical Factory, Hu Boping, Zhu Shaoming, Teng Yaotian, Ji Guihe, and Liu Bihua, who helped sell the counterfeit drugs, a total of six people. Many counterfeit drugs, as well as various raw materials and machinery used to manufacture the counterfeit drugs, were seized and taken to the police station. The Public Works Department's Health Department tested the counterfeit drugs and determined that the counterfeit drugs did not contain the main ingredients of Da Jian Huang. Therefore, these counterfeit drugs not only do not have any efficacy after being taken by patients, but they may also delay treatment and endanger their lives. The situation is extremely abhorrent, so the police authorities have decided to severely investigate all the suspects.

### New Undersea Cable Across the Huangpu River

A self-defense corps member, No. 161, Bao 12, Lianbao 2, Xinzha District, while on duty at Buck Road at 8:50 PM the night before last, encountered a dispute between passersby. The corps member stepped forward to mediate. At that moment, a corps member from another bao blew a whistle. A patrol officer, No. 1189, passing by mistakenly believed that the No. 161 corps member had blown the whistle without cause and detained him at the police station. The corps member has since been released, after the guarantor Zhang Dezhu and the civil defense corps squad leader Zhang Shi negotiated with the Xinzha police station.

### Wenzhou Native Association in Shanghai Registers and Sends Off Fellow Townsmen; Requests Authorities to Add Ships

Recently, the Wenzhou Native Association in Shanghai established an office dedicated to assisting the municipal authorities in dispersing residents. However, due to the long-term disruption of shipping between Shanghai and Wenzhou, Wenzhou natives returning to their hometown must detour through Ningbo, Jinhua, and other places to arrive, which is very inconvenient. Recently, in order to facilitate the return of Wenzhou natives, the association organized group returns and requested the authorities to allocate ships for direct voyages to Wenzhou to avoid circuitous routes. It is reported that discussions are currently underway with the authorities. Since the beginning of registration for group returns, many Wenzhou natives have registered with the association. As of yesterday, more than 400 people had registered. Other native associations have also received many applications from fellow townsmen seeking to return to their hometowns.

It is reported that the bank received a total of more than 32 million yuan in various deposits on that day, causing the staff to be overwhelmed. The business hours were extended by two hours to cope with the situation.

### Requisition of Allied Enterprises by the Asia Development Board Starting Next Month; Names of Requisitioned Enterprises Disclosed

Sixty-Four Companies Entrusted with Agency Management

From April 1st, the management rights of all Allied commercial firms in the Shanghai area that cannot be left in the hands of Allied nationals will be taken over by Japanese commercial firms and Sino-Japanese joint ventures. According to an announcement by the China Central Liaison Department of the Asia Development Board, the following are the enterprises entrusted to take over Allied commercial firms:

Sixty-Four Companies

At the start of the Pacific War, the Japanese Army and Navy authorities in Central China took over Allied enterprises in Central China (excluding the Wuhan area). Subsequently, on December 23rd of last year, the joint command of the Japanese Army and Navy in the Shanghai area announced that the director of the China Central Liaison Department of the Asia Development Board would be responsible for supervising all Allied enterprises not yet taken over by the Army and Navy. Therefore, the China Central Liaison Department decided that from April 1st, the management rights of the aforementioned Allied enterprises (including factories in Shanghai) would be entrusted to Sino-Japanese joint ventures and Japanese commercial firms affiliated with the China Central Revitalization Company.

Several Companies Requisitioned

The China Central Liaison Department announced this decision the other day and released a list of the Allied commercial firms to be requisitioned. A total of sixty-four Japanese commercial firms will be entrusted with managing the Allied commercial firms. All power companies will be taken over by the China Central Hydroelectric Company. Transportation enterprises such as the Shanghai Telephone Company will be taken over by the China Central Electrical Communications Company. The Shanghai Gas Company will be taken over by the Shanghai Gas Company, and the Shanghai Tram Company will be taken over by the China Central Automobile Company. All textile companies will be taken over by the Japanese Textile Association. The announcement released by the China Central Liaison Department is recorded below: "Regarding the enemy properties requisitioned by the Japanese military authorities and entrusted to the Asia Development Board, it has been decided to entrust the management rights of various public utilities and other important enterprises to Sino-Japanese joint ventures and other relevant commercial firms affiliated with the China Central Revitalization Company. This is a necessary measure aimed at unifying and controlling the economic structure of Central China, thereby expanding production capacity and adjusting supply and demand. The transfer of enemy enterprises may cause temporary supply imbalances, which will be gradually improved by this department."

### Eye Ailment

— Lei Kaiqian

A friend, a kind friend with feelings, suddenly heard that he was suffering from a serious eye ailment.

The first time I went to see him, his eyes were as red as fire. I comforted him, saying, "As long as you can rest quietly, you will naturally get better slowly."

A few days later, I lowered my head again, crossed the road and the alleyway, and stepped over the muddy wet ground to my friend's house.

My friend was furious, locked alone in his room. I pushed the door open, and his eyes suddenly turned into two torches, burning my heart. I said to him, as I said goodbye, "Your eye ailment needs rest, it needs quiet rest."

But his answer to me was a silence that seemed like gratitude, or a contempt that seemed like disgust.

On the road, in the alleyway, in the crowd full of unrestrained laughter, in the ranks lurking with mournful cries, I ran every day, from here to there, from there to here, busy, busy. And so I even forgot a friend, a kind friend with feelings, in the back of my mind.

One day, I met a friend's friend, who told me that the good friend's eyes were already blind.

I was shocked, and I rushed to my friend's house. I held his hand, I could only be silent, because I then thought I had lost the means to comfort him; he also held my hand, he also could only be silent, but,

But his blind eyes suddenly shed silent tears.

Depressed, and lowering my head again, I crossed the road and the alleyway, and stepped over the muddy wet ground, returning to my own dark bedroom.

Following my falling into quiet contemplation.

My friend's eyes are already blind, but, but he can still shed tears. Ah, tears,——

I rubbed my own eyes, and I remembered my day-and-night, night-and-day busyness. In the crowd full of unrestrained laughter, in the ranks lurking with mournful cries, I opened my eyes wide, running back and forth, but I never saw my own tears.

But, a friend's eyes, a kind friend's eyes with feelings, when they were bright, could be as red as fire; after they were blind, they could still shed tears...

Suddenly I felt my own eyes, swelling and aching violently. Alas, I really am suffering from a serious eye ailment.

### Ode to the Spring Breeze

— Tian Ye

After a long period of hibernation and numbness, I gradually woke up.

For an entire winter, I, like a mummy in a stone coffin, sat numbly in my small room every day. Outside the window, the north wind shook the bald, barren trees, driving away the drooping, dispirited sparrows, and also violently beat against the window. The sky was gray and gloomy, without a trace of a smile, as if angry with someone, or as if crying. But I, only sat numbly in my small room, like a mummy in a stone coffin, without thought or soul.

But, winter will not last long after all, nor will it forever rule the world of spring! Now, spring has come. I opened the window, letting the spring breeze softly blow into the room, blowing on my body, and even blowing into my dry heart.

The blood flowed happily, the soul was resurrected, the heart was no longer lonely, it was filled with the vitality of youth, and I became active together with nature.

"Spring is ours!" I exclaimed.

Yes, spring is indeed ours! I am not old, I am still young. Going out the door, I saw all the scenes of spring: the azure sky, several clouds floating quietly, and occasionally paper kites appeared in the distance, also flying gently. Here, I could not see the verdant trees of youth, nor the boundless green fields. I felt a slight sense of melancholy. Memory did not completely deceive me; it quietly told me that in my hometown, this should be the time when orioles fly and grasses grow!

I sank into silent memories! In a gentle spring breeze!

Essay

### Happiness

— Qiao Wen

Happiness is an art and also a philosophy. It is not wanton sensual pleasure and satisfaction. There is an insurmountable chasm between human happiness and porcine satisfaction. The former is progress, the latter is decadence.

True happiness is a force, a force of life. In suffering and misfortune, it gives you the courage to live. It enables you to conquer life, to be the master of life, not the slave of life.

Therefore, you must maintain happiness on the journey of life. We must all maintain happiness. Only in this way can we survive and conquer life.

Animal World

### A World Beyond Human Comprehension

— Ye Meizhen

Is it possible for all human beings in the world to be filled with moral concepts, so that all immoral thoughts no longer exist?

Can we imagine such a world? I can answer you, this world can indeed exist. The world of insects seems to be a model of the moral world. These virtues of ants, proven by science, have shaken the entire moral world, and human thought has completely shifted toward a new direction.

This fact was discovered after hundreds of scientists engaged in research on hundreds of different species of ants. But do not forget, I must still remind you, that due to environmental needs, the moral behavior of ants is not applied outside the group. They will still fight with other tribes.

Let us make a fable-like comparison between the wisdom of ants and human life. Imagine a world filled with a working group. They are busy working day and night, building houses, digging ditches, and constructing bridges, while also devoting themselves to farming and gardening, and raising many kinds of livestock—I tell you: ants can raise nearly 584 different kinds of animals—this group also loves cleanliness. Although they are busy with work all day long, they still groom themselves several times a day. In addition to these heavy daily tasks, they also have to raise countless children. These tender and weak children will die if the weather changes even slightly, so these hardworking parents must constantly relocate their children to keep them warm.

Now, let's talk about the most amazing fact: the inhibition of sexuality in ants is not due to nature, but out of free will; it has been found that ants use a systematic health regimen to inhibit or develop sexuality at will. They can know that sexuality does not need to exist unless it is for the survival of the race. This is a perfect example of voluntarily suppressing all desires for the happiness of the majority of their kind!

Inhibiting sexuality is one of the many self-controlled natures of ants. In short: ants have freed themselves from all selfish impulses, and even hunger and thirst are not satisfied privately, but contribute the entire life of the society to the welfare of the public, helping each other, and protecting the young and weak. Their lives are expressed in practical work, and individuals sacrifice themselves for the race. This is the highest moral altruism! So it raises questions for thinkers:

"What has mankind done like what ants have done?"

Thousands of years ago, an ancient Hebrew writer said: "You sluggard! Learn from the ant!" He never expected that this maxim would be confirmed by 20th-century scientific experiments.

### Tobacco

— Ba Du

Americans often say, two cigarettes in the dark...a cigarette and a cup by the fireplace...a pipe and a fishing rod by the creek. How poetic! The so-called "lucky man" is nothing more than that.

Men of letters have inextricable ties with tobacco, as seen in poems, essays, and biographies. Moreover, once you get your hands on this stuff, it is hard to let go; as the writer Charles Lamb said, it is more difficult to abstain from tobacco than to forsake the love of a woman.

The English poet Bulwer-Lytton praised the pipe as the supreme comforter. He felt that the swirling smoke came from the bottom of his heart; he said that smoking could promote thought and open the mind. A person who smokes becomes wise as a sage and has love like a Samaritan.

The novelist Thackeray doted on cigars, saying they were good companions, slightly stimulating, relieving pain in peace, and the only gift to enhance friendship.

The ancients were like this, no wonder people today are even more intense.

Cigarettes, cigars, pipe tobacco... come rolling in.

Especially those who use their brains cannot live without tobacco, cannot work without tobacco, and to put it more severely, I am afraid they will not be able to survive without it.

A prominent figure in the history of tobacco, Lord Walter Raleigh (1552-1618), was the first to import tobacco from Virginia in the United States to England. That was during the Elizabethan dynasty, and it actually became fashionable for a time. In less than a century, there were more than 7,000 tobacco shops in London.

That being said, there were also many people who opposed smoking at the time. And the most effective and humorous way was to put a glass of wine in front of the smoker. As a result, the smoker smoked himself, and tobacco and wine became one. To say that one could give up tobacco and only drink wine is just an ideal. King James of England opposed it strongly, but it was still ineffective.

At the time, the Pope was very serious and showed no mercy to this "fragrant grass beauty." Several terrible fires in Russia were caused by smoking in bed. Grand Duke Michael ordered that anyone caught smoking would be whipped for the first offense, have their noses cut off for the second offense, and be executed mercilessly for the third offense.

Although tobacco seemed lovely, life was more valuable after all, and the habit of smoking was temporarily suppressed.

### Writers' Quirks

— Tianshui

When Tolstoy wrote, he often wore simple, crude clothes of Russian peasants, and the clothes were made very loose, so that neither his head, neck, hands, nor feet would feel the slightest restraint.

Balzac often wore a set of nightclothes when writing at night; if it was during the day, he had to close the windows and doors completely and write under several candles.

### Sharing the Same Boat in Storms

— By He Jia Zhi

(II) Sorrow and Joy

Great Aunt and others leaned out, and everyone advocated that if it was possible to buy on credit, they should ask Wei Yunqing to buy it. Wei Yunqing smiled and said, "In our village, how many families prepare the money before someone dies? It's possible, it's possible. Moreover, our Wei family and your Ye family are family friends for generations, which makes it even more possible." Just as everyone was about to thank Wei Yunqing, he added, "However, the Wei Yunji lumberyard's rule is that for one month of credit, one percent interest is added; for two months of credit, two percent interest is added; three months, three percent; four months, four percent, haha, I can't break my rules just because we are family friends." Wei Yunqing picked up the broken tiles and broken bricks on the ground, while making this statement.

Li Youxie and Second Madam Ye discussed that as long as a large sum of money was not taken out immediately, it would be like drinking poison to quench thirst. Li Youxie was about to tell Weicheng when Second Madam Ye said, "Weicheng, let him rest for a while, don't make him worry about this again. Anyway, uncle is doing things for his sister and nephew with utmost loyalty. If uncle says it's good, who would have the heart to say it's not?" Li Youxie cupped his hands at Wei Yunqing, saying he would go with him to take a look at the burial items. Wei Yunqing walked ahead, repeatedly saying that was of course, of course at that time. But before he even walked out the door, he laughed again and said, "This old man is useless. At this age, my two legs often tell me how old I am. There is a boat at the Ye residence, and I am too lazy to move, so I would like to take a boat back to my humble abode.
