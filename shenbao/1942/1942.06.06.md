### Germany and Finland Seek Closer Cooperation; Hitler Suddenly Visits Finland; Meets with President Ryti to Discuss Important Political Issues

At the same time, Hitler met with Finnish President Ryti, who led the entire cabinet, the speaker of the parliament, and representatives of the workers to meet the German leader. Field Marshal Mannerheim also led senior Finnish military officers to meet Hitler. In order to express the close relationship between Germany and Finland, which share a common destiny, Hitler presented Field Marshal Mannerheim with the German Iron Cross Grand Cross. Afterwards, Hitler, the Finnish President, Mannerheim, and Field Marshal Keitel had a long talk and exchanged opinions, and the atmosphere between the two sides was extremely cordial."

Berlin, [Day Omitted], Havas News Agency - Officials announced that Leader Hitler and Generals Keitel had recently met with Finnish President Ryti and Finnish Commander-in-Chief General Mannerheim near the Finnish front line.

According to Finnish officials, the country's government decided to grant General Mannerheim the title of "Marshal of Finland".

Helsinki, 5th, Haitong News Agency - German Leader Hitler, in his congratulatory speech to Finnish Commander-in-Chief Mannerheim, said, "I am deeply honored to be able to represent the German nation and the German army in congratulating the great military leader of the Finnish army, whom we admire. Finland and Germany have become armed comrades for the second time in history. The first time the two countries fought side by side, fighting a common enemy, has extended the relationship between the two countries. The second common struggle will surely make this relationship permanent. It is easy for friendships to develop when we know that there is a brave army on our left and right. That is what the whole of Germany feels at this moment. Germany has boundless admiration for the Finnish nation and its great military leader. Finally, Mr. Hitler expressed his gratitude for the hospitality of Finnish President Ryti and wished General Mannerheim a long life.

### British and German Armies Engaging in Intense Competition; North African War Enters New Stage; Fierce Fighting in Marmarica Region

Swiss Capital, Havas News Agency - Correspondents from various newspapers in London and Berlin have recently telegraphed analyses of the North African war situation, saying that it has entered a new stage. In short, the German Commander-in-Chief in North Africa, General Rommel, has reorganized his troops, and the war has entered a new phase. In the initial stage of the operation, Rommel attempted to avoid his troops being completely surrounded and to expand the breach he had made in the British minefields. Therefore, he occupied an important position between the German bases west of Knightsbridge and east of Mechili and Timimi, and the German resistance was extraordinarily strong. The British Eighth Army, realizing that a frontal attack would result in heavy casualties, avoided the solid and attacked the empty, attempting to completely cut off all communication lines between Rommel's base in Knightsbridge and his bases to the southwest, so that he would lose contact between the front and rear. British troops have now occupied the area of Rodanda near Knightsbridge, and it is unknown whether they will continue their offensive while the German troops are still on the defensive, but this will depend on the remaining strength of the two armies. Generally speaking, this battle will be mainly infantry. However, the supply problem in North Africa is quite serious, and it is not easy for the British army to resume its offensive. Up to now, both sides are exhausted. The German Afrika Korps has lost half of its tanks, and the British have also suffered heavy losses in the air, as British planes are ordered to attack German armored divisions regardless of their own sacrifices. At the same time, Berlin is optimistic about the future of the Libyan war, but remains silent. Yesterday's official war report was vague, indicating that General Rommel does not want to reveal military information until the war situation is absolutely favorable. In short, the Libyan war is not a matter of advancing or retreating positions, but a strategic issue, as German Commander Rommel and British Commander Auchinleck are both outstanding generals and command the best troops. It is natural for them to engage in intense competition to win by surprise, so the North African war is actually a combination of mobile warfare, blitzkrieg, ambush warfare, and encirclement.

Rome, 4th, Havas News Agency - Regarding the North African war, war dispatches here state that the motorized units of both sides are engaging in a battle in the Marmarica region, southwest of the port of Tobruk, each vying to encircle the other and charging with tanks, resulting in a earth-shattering battle. The German-Italian Allied forces finally captured the enemy positions and encircled and annihilated the main British forces. Especially numerous British troops were encircled in the areas of Got and El Uerbia. Although these troops fought to the death, they were eventually annihilated. The number of tanks lost by the British is equivalent to about one and a half divisions, indicating the severity of the damage they sustained.

### British Daily War Expenses Exceed 10 Million Pounds

Stockholm, 5th, Haitong News Agency - According to a recent telegram from London, by September of this year, after three years of British participation in the war, British war expenses will reach an astonishing 10,000,000,000 pounds. Since the outbreak of the European war, almost all of the 9,000,000,000 pounds allocated for war expenses has been used up, so the House of Commons will have to allocate another 1,000,000,000 pounds soon to sustain it until the end of August this year. The daily war expenses in 1939 were 5,000,000 pounds, but they have now increased to 12,500,000 pounds. During the First World War, Britain's total war expenses were 8,500,000,000 pounds. In other words, in the current war, Britain has been fighting for less than three years, and its war expenses have already exceeded the total war expenses of the last war by approximately 1,500,000,000 pounds, not including the war expenses of the British Empire and the funds lent by the United States.

### Eastern Front Areas: Only Localized Battles; Soviet Position Improved; Preparing to Counter German Offensives

Berlin, 5th (Haitong News Agency): German military sources here claimed last night that the German offensive on the Eastern Front is imminent. The only unknowns are the timing and location. The enemy also has the same questions.

Stockholm, Sweden, 4th (Havas News Agency): A special correspondent from Havas World News Agency cabled from the front, saying that "small-scale battles" are currently occurring in various sectors of the Eastern Front, with the most important being the fighting in the Kalinin area. Both belligerents are tight-lipped about the location of the fighting. According to Soviet sources, the Red Army has improved its position and is continuing to advance. German counterattacks attempting to retake lost ground have been repelled six times, with German casualties reaching 2,000. However, a broadcast from Radio Moscow stated that "although the Red Army has lost several towns and villages, the Germans have failed to launch a large-scale offensive." On the German side, it is claimed that the German army has adopted an encirclement strategy, annihilating the Red Army. 1,500 Red Army corpses were left behind, and 2,000 soldiers were captured. The fighting in the Lake Ilmen area is also extremely fierce. Since March of this year, the Germans have adopted a pincer strategy, and the Red Army has been surrounded until now. The Red Army is intensifying its bombing to destroy this pocket encirclement. On the Leningrad front, the Germans have also deployed a large number of reinforcements to consolidate their positions. However, these attacks by both sides are only minor skirmishes and cannot be seen as a prelude to a general German offensive. Military figures here have various speculations as to why the offensive has not yet begun, but they believe that since Germany has made large-scale preparations on the Eastern Front, there is no doubt that a major offensive will eventually be launched.

Berlin, 4th (Havas News Agency): The German News Agency recently reported that the German Air Force, in order to destroy the last stronghold of the Soviets on the Crimean Peninsula, namely the Sevastopol Fortress, flew to the area yesterday to bomb Soviet positions, artillery batteries, port facilities, railway tracks, and stations, destroying multiple freight trains and shooting down 16 Soviet aircraft. The German side only lost four aircraft. In the central airspace, German aircraft were also very active, bombing Red Army rear bases and ammunition depots, causing heavy Soviet losses in manpower and material resources. In the northern sector, German aircraft shot down 11 Soviet aircraft and concentrated their bombing on Red Army positions.

### Fierce Guerrilla Warfare in Yugoslavia; With Ethnic and Religious Background; Blackshirt Troops Overwhelmed

Stockholm, Sweden, 4th (Havas News Agency): The "Basel News" recently published a dispatch from its Rome correspondent, stating that Italian troops are continuing operations in the Balkans to suppress armed bandits. The fighting remains extremely fierce, and the Italian government has dispatched a large number of infantry reinforcements. Currently, the center of guerrilla warfare is in the areas of Lika, Montenegro, Bosnia, Herzegovina, and Slovenia. The situation in various places is extremely chaotic. All the major rebel leaders are communist elements. Their rebellion has social, ethnic, and religious backgrounds, as well as a common factor: sympathy for the former Yugoslavia. Italian troops are currently exerting all their strength to fight the rebels, but the fighting has not ended. All areas where guerrilla warfare is taking place have rugged terrain, and the rebels are tenacious and determined to resist to the death. Only after the end of the war in the East and the eradication of Bolshevism in its homeland can the Balkan war come to an end.

London, [Day not mentioned] (Havas News Agency): Regarding the British raid on the occupied French port of Le Touquet, an official statement was recently released, stating that this was only a "small-scale reconnaissance operation." Our warships sank one German cruiser and inflicted damage on another. We suffered no casualties or losses.

Berlin, 4th (Havas News Agency): Military figures here recently released the following account of a British commando raid on occupied France: Yesterday morning, several British small craft, under the cover of low-flying aircraft, approached the French coast near Le Touquet.

After their defeat, the British retreated in several rubber dinghies back to their original ships.

It is currently a naval port for the British light fleet.

### U.S. Expands Influence in the Middle East

The regulations for the use of monthly tickets on these two tram lines stipulate that China General Omnibus Company monthly tickets can be used from Hongkou or Yangtzepoo to Nanjing Road and the Bund. Shanghai Electric Construction Company monthly tickets can only be used to the north side of the Garden Bridge. A regular ticket must be purchased for travel beyond this point.

First and Third Class

Reclassified: All trams within the International Settlement will designate the entire front car as First Class and the trailing car as Third Class, effective yesterday. The white section of the front car previously designated as Third Class has had the "Third Class" markings removed. The partitions between First and Third Class in the cars are expected to be removed soon. The car body colors have not yet been changed due to the hasty implementation, but it is expected that they will gradually be repainted in a uniform color. At the same time, it has been stipulated that the front door of the First Class cars will be the boarding entrance, and the rear door will be the disembarking exit. This is intended to reduce crowding and shorten boarding and disembarking times. However, many passengers were unaware of the new regulations yesterday, causing some confusion. The First and Third Class distinctions on trolleybuses remain unchanged. Trolleybuses on lines 14 and 18 that cross the Suzhou Creek no longer require passengers to disembark when crossing the bridge, but they must be inspected by sentries on the bridge before proceeding.

### Wansheng Steamer Sailed to Ningbo Last Night

The Wansheng Steamer (formerly known as the Haifu Steamer) has been preparing for service on the Shanghai-Ningbo route for a long time, as reported previously. It is now known that the ship sailed from Yangtzepoo Wharf at 4 p.m. yesterday for its maiden voyage to Ningbo. Mr. Gu Chunyuan, the new purser, boarded the ship yesterday and was greeted by the crew standing at the ship's side. The ship is scheduled to return to Shanghai from Ningbo on the 8th and make its second voyage to Ningbo on the 9th. Subsequently, it will depart from Shanghai to Ningbo every four days, replacing the Hualin Steamer's schedule.

### Newly Established Banking and Money Businesses Must First Apply for Registration

Mr. Zhou Fohai's Remarks

Allied News Agency: Many newly established banks, money houses, trust companies, and other financial institutions in various regions have not registered in accordance with procedures. Mr. Zhou Fohai made the following remarks: "Recently, many new banks, money houses, trust companies, and other financial institutions have been established in various regions. Most of them have not registered in accordance with legal procedures before commencing business and accepting deposits, making loans, and handling exchange transactions. These financial institutions are entrusted with the assets of the public. If they are not registered in advance, there is no way to verify the validity of their capital, the reliability of their credit, the scope of their business, or the use of funds. If they are allowed to operate freely, not only will the financial system be disrupted, but the public's assets will also lose their protection. Laws and regulations have long stipulated that banks, trust companies, and other companies and firms engaged in banking and money businesses must not accept deposits or make loans without prior approval and registration. Currently, among the newly established banking and money businesses, many have applied for registration, but many others disregard the law and commence business without authorization. In order to protect the assets of the people and maintain social finance, it is necessary to strictly prohibit such illegal financial institutions. The following specific measures are hereby announced:

1. All banking and money businesses that have already commenced operations but have not yet registered must apply for registration within one week. Those who fail to apply for registration after the deadline will be strictly prohibited.
2. Hereafter, no business may commence operations without prior approval and registration. Those who commence business without authorization will be ordered to close down and will be punished according to law.

It is hoped that all banking and money businesses will understand this and strictly comply. This will not only protect the assets of the people and society but also enable the businesses themselves to obtain legal status."

### Convicted Thief Xie Jin'an Escorted to Nanshi for Execution

Xie Jin'an, a young man from Henan, 21 years old, was arrested by the General Police for committing robbery and murder two years ago due to his idleness and association with gangsters. After a clear interrogation, he was sentenced to death and held in custody pending execution. However, since the outbreak of the war, there has been no place to execute these prisoners sentenced to death, so they have been temporarily held in prison. Only the Tilanqiao Prison in the International Settlement has many prisoners sentenced to death. Currently, all executions in Shanghai are handled by the Nanshi Detention Center. Therefore, the police extracted Xie Jin'an from prison yesterday morning and escorted him to the Nanshi Detention Center for execution by hanging in accordance with the law.

### U.S. Nationals Leaving America: Japan-bound American Nationals Embark for East Africa; List of U.S. Officials Leaving Shanghai Has Been Compiled; Troop Transports Flying Banners, Lighthouses Illuminating the Night

The English-language "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury" states that contacts within the Swiss Consulate advised the newspaper that the official roster of American and Canadian nationals who would be departing Shanghai in the initial expatriate movement this middle of the month, has been finalized, with each individual on the list notified by letter. The list, however, could not be publicly released at this time. According to one senior official, the full list of expatriates has not yet been compiled. Furthermore, that initial list would have to be matched with civilian expatriates leaving in the first transfer.

First Batch Leaving

Six Hundred Fifty People: The first batch of expatriates to leave numbers six hundred and fifty and includes a number of U.S. and Canadian nationals coming from the mainland to Shanghai; that Shanghai has now become the primary impediment to the expatriation efforts. The officials slated for the first removal, will include U.S. journalists. The Swiss Consulate could not state for sure when the first ship of expatriates would be departing. Since the mid-month is still ten days away, there is considerable faith that the June 15 ship departure plan can still be met.

Expatriate Transports

A Glimpse of Their Banners: With Swiss and Spanish diplomatic corps looking on, preparations have commenced for the U.S. and Japanese expatriate exchange to be held in Portuguese East Africa's Lourenço Marques. Japan-bound American nationals have departed from the U.S. on the fourth of this month; U.S.-to-East Africa sail times are longer than Japan-to-East Africa routes. Japan-bound U.S. expatriates also prepare to embark for the handover point in mid-month. The transports carrying these expatriates will fly specialized banners. Decks and boat-side hulls will feature enormous White Cross markings. At night, the ships will be illuminated by lighthouses, and four specialized signal beacons — two red and two green — are alternately placed on the masts.

Students from Various Schools

### A.D.C., a Shanghai-Based Western Amateur Theatre Group, Presents "Richard III"

— White Bear

The most difficult Shakespearean play to perform is "Hamlet," followed closely by this one. Yet, Mr. Smith.Wright managed to sustain the audience's attention through seventeen scenes over three hours, which is truly commendable. This is because it cannot rely on crowd scenes or any abrupt interjections to aid the plot's progression. Instead, it must bring Shakespeare's villain to life before the audience. Therefore, most critics of "Richard III" believe that the actor's success is crucial to the success of Shakespeare's play. If there is any praise for this 285th performance by the ADC, the first accolade should go to the actor playing the lead role.

Of course, the entire cast, both male and female, numbered in the dozens, and under the director's careful arrangement, all worked diligently and gave their best. Among the female roles, Dorothea Brooking, who played Anne (Edward's widow), won the audience's applause for her poignant performance in the first scene. Generally speaking, however, the female roles were stronger than the male roles. The actor playing the Duke of Buckingham seemed to lack energy. Perhaps his pronunciation and voice when reading lines were not quite correct (there were many American accents), and he was not loud enough, which diminished the effect he should have had.

The costumes of the entire play conveyed the splendor of the London palace in 1485, coupled with the lighting, which naturally helped the performance's success. However, if there was a weakness in the entire play, it was the sound effects, which they might improve in future performances. The advantage of the set design was the rationality of their backstage preparation, resulting in speed. However, the street scenes did not seem to capture the atmosphere of London, and the frequent appearance of the Tower of London lacked realism. Especially the turbulent clouds seen from the tower, which at first glance could be mistaken for the muddy waters of the Thames. The motivation for this configuration was desirable, but it did not achieve its ideal state. However, the dream scene of King Richard in the final act fully realized the advantages of modern material equipment. As for the final sword fight between Richard and the Duke of Richmond, audiences in Shanghai, who are used to movies, would not find it satisfactory. Of course, comparing their amateur technique to the full martial arts performances of our Peking Opera would be even more disparate. Fortunately, the playwright had the victorious Duke of Richmond crowned Henry VII on the battlefield, so the audience, having witnessed the vicissitudes of fortune in this fourteen-year period of history (from 1478 to 1485), obtained a "karma" conclusion and left the theater smiling contentedly.

### Extremely Tense Sino-Western Football Match Yesterday: Chinese United Slightly Wins Over St. Francis, Score 5 to 4... Both Teams Give Wonderful Performances

The third Sino-Western football match was held at 5:30 PM yesterday at the second field of the Racecourse, with over 20,000 spectators. Chinese United narrowly defeated St. Francis by a score of 5 to 4 amidst a four-sided siege. The score in the first half was 4 to 2, also favoring Chinese United. In this segment, Dai Linjing, Wu Qixiang, and Zhang Lingen made the greatest contributions for Chinese United, while Carlo Liequ, Fuen, and goalkeeper Youxun Gufu performed best for St. Francis. Referee Zhang Le and linesmen He Chunhui and Chen Jixiang decided that when the time came, Chinese United would have the advantage of kicking off and fought valiantly. As the ball crossed the final defensive line, Xu Zizi of St. Francis cleverly devised an empty formation, turning danger into safety. Around the fifth minute, A Dai led his troops in a full-scale attack. Zu Xiang outflanked on the left and shot from about fifteen yards, scoring in the left corner, thus opening the scoring. Chinese United led 1 to 0. Less than a minute later, Inglisa of St. Francis drove straight forward, but Zhang Zhaopeng of Chinese United was momentarily careless, fortunately missing the shot. Around the twelfth minute, Hanny Bow of St. Francis handled the ball, resulting in a penalty. Han Longhai took the kick and passed it to A Dai, Yuan Kuntian, and Zao Gu waiting for the ball, who swept it in with one kick, scoring again, making it 1 to 0. In the twenty-third minute, Zhang Lingen of Chinese United made a long pass to Wu Qixiang, who headed the ball in. Miller, the central defender of St. Francis, could not jump high enough, making it 3 to 0. Fei Chunhua of Chinese United then scored alone, making the score 4 to 0. St. Francis refused to give up easily. Ivanoff on the right wing, with the assistance of Pan Tuosun, made a contribution on the border, and Qin Bigaobao was caught off guard, and the iron gate was broken. St. Francis pulled back to 4 to 1. In the forty-third minute, Augusti of St. Francis became active again and swept a ball into the left corner, making the score 4 to 2. In the second half, Qin Bigaobao of Chinese United retired and was replaced by Zhang Bangshi, and Wu Qixiang was injured in the foot and replaced by Cao Qin Fang. St. Francis replaced most of their players, including talented players. The goalkeeper was replaced, and Youxun Gufu and Carlo Liequ also came to the front line for support. Augusti replaced H. Pan Tuosun, and the formation became even stronger. Not long after the start of the second half, St. Francis launched a large-scale offensive, repeatedly approaching the midfield, but unfortunately, the ball did not enter the goal. In the seventh minute, Pan Tuosun drove straight forward, and Zhang Lingen, ordered to intercept, committed a foul. Hanny Bow took the penalty kick and scored, making the score 4 to 3. Seeing that the situation was unfavorable, the generals of Chinese United, led by Dai in the center, raised their arms and launched a fierce attack. Xu Erzi of St. Francis, eager to win, committed a penalty foul. Dai, amidst the shouts of 20,000 spectators, rebuilt the tree again, making the score 5 to 3. With one minute remaining, Fuen broke through the defense smoothly and shot strongly from 20 yards, scoring. The score became 5 to 4. Soon after, the game ended. Chinese United defeated St. Francis 5 to 4. The lineups for yesterday's game are as follows: Chinese United: Yuan Kuntian, Qin Bigaobao (replaced by Zhuang Youren), Zhang Banglun, Zhang Lingen, Zhang Zhaopeng, Han Longhai, Chen Xiaoping, Cao Qinfang, Wu Qixiang, Dai Linjing, Jia Youliang, Fei Chunhua. St. Francis: Youxun Gufu (replaced by Miller), Xu Gesierzi, Lie Figlinburg, Hanny Bow, Lai Liao, Augusti, W. Pan Tuosun, England (replaced by Carlo Liequ), Fuen, Ivanoff.

### Bullish Momentum Declines, Bond Market Shows Slight Recovery

The over-the-counter bond market saw a slight decline in bullish sentiment yesterday. Although purchases were still considerable, demand was not as enthusiastic as before, while sales continued to flow steadily. As a result, market prices were slightly stable but somewhat weak. The initial opening was very strong, so the highest prices of the day for four types were the opening prices. Only Type A was an exception. The situation was due to the release of floating profits and pressure from short sellers. Therefore, strong players waited for an opportunity to act and did not take unnecessary risks. At the opening yesterday, Shuntai Qianyi bought in vigorously, so the opening price was the highest. This was followed by absorption by Hongxing Lianhe and Tongshen Tongkang Runde Huheji, mostly supplied by Hongda Tongli Jiufeng and Xinhua Runli Lianyi Xinyi Yichang. The trend may see a slight recovery. Yesterday's average prices showed that except for Type A, which was slightly better by just over 10 cents, Type B saw some changes, while the rest fell by just over 10 to 40 cents. The volume of transactions was approximately one hundred and some tens of thousands of dollars. A concise table is listed below:

Category | Highest | Lowest | Closing | Change from Previous Day
---|---|---|---|---
Unified A | $35.20 | $34.00 | $34.90 | Up $0.10
Unified B | $34.50 | $33.60 | $33.80 | Flat

Therefore, the quiet hardware market has suddenly become lively, and the mood of the industry has also improved. However, due to a lack of inventory, prices are quite high. Currently, 24-gauge patterned tinplate is selling for $60 per sheet, and $3,000 per box. 26-gauge goods are selling for $55 per sheet, and $2,500 per box.

(Each box contains 50 sheets; the above are all market prices for Central Reserve Certificates.) The public meeting decided to continue publishing advertisements later.

### Mei Lanfang Safe in Hong Kong

— Jian Xin

Recently, many people have been discussing the issue of Mei Lanfang's life and death. Some say he is dead, some say he is still alive... Various rumors seem to have created an unsolvable "mystery" about Mei Lanfang. In particular, Mei's fans are even more concerned about his whereabouts. Not long ago, when this newspaper's reporter interviewed Li Shifang, it was said that Mei Lanfang would leave Hong Kong for Shanghai at the end of May. This news has now been proven to be a false hope. I think there are many people in this newspaper's readership who care about Mr. Mei, and they must want to know everything about him. Here, I will report some news about him:

A few days ago, a certain tabloid published the sad news about Mei Lanfang, saying that he was tragically drowned on a certain ship on his way to Shanghai. The news spread, and Mei's fans in Shanghai were shocked and discolored, causing a great commotion in the city. In fact, this news is not accurate. According to a report I received from the French radio station: Mei Lanfang is still safe in Hong Kong. Initially, he intended to come to Shanghai by ship, but later abandoned the plan for some reason. According to recent visitors from Hong Kong, Mei has indeed not left Hong Kong. Moreover, a certain consulate in this port has a happy event and wanted to invite Mei to Shanghai to participate in the grand event. The consulate received a reply from Hong Kong stating that Mr. Mei is in Hong Kong and cannot come to Shanghai to offer congratulations, etc. The above are all reliable and accurate news. Readers in Shanghai can dispel the mystery of Mei's life and death. Mei Lanfang is truly "blessed by heaven," which is great news for us. Finally, there is an incidental piece of good news to report: Ms. Hu Die, the film queen of that year, is also safe in Hong Kong.

### "Virgin Tears"

— Prelude Old Pine

"Virgin Tears" is a four-act tragedy. If compared to "A Narcissus Flower," the latter is like a beautiful poem, while the former is like a moving piece of music. The two plays have completely different flavors, but their high standards are comparable. The story is roughly as follows:

It was a cold and bleak night when a scandal occurred in a room of a Shanghai hotel: Guan Ruifeng, the manager, seduced and raped a young woman named Hong Meilin, who worked as a handicraft maker in his department store. Since Guan Ruifeng made several fortunes through speculative business, his life became increasingly debauched. The media often criticized him, and his son Guan Minying—born to Ruifeng's first wife—left home several years ago in dissatisfaction. Naturally, there would still be a group of people who specialize in flattering and ingratiating themselves, constantly coming and going around him. For example, Ge Yuhou, who helped him lure Meilin, and Wen Mo Chi, who wrote articles praising him, were among them. However, although Guan Ruifeng was good at bullying young women, his own second concubine was also secretly being played with by others. Moreover, after he achieved his goal with Meilin, things did not go as smoothly as imagined.

The media's criticism of Ruifeng became increasingly fierce. At the same time, Minying, who had always opposed his father, suddenly returned from abroad. All of this made Ruifeng feel somewhat uneasy. He was worried that the scandal of raping a young woman would ruin his established reputation and status. He decided to follow Yuhou's clever plan and have Meilin formally become his third wife. Things went quite smoothly, and the weak Hong mother and daughter were almost succumbed to their lewd power. However, Meilin remained indignant and always loved Fu Ge, a typesetter, in her heart. Coincidentally, Minying and Meilin's brother Yulin were the closest friends in the countryside. This time, Minying returned to visit the Hong mother and daughter on behalf of Yulin. It was when Yuhou was coercing Meilin to go to Guan's residence that Minying arrived at the Hong's house and discovered his father's despicable behavior, like a thunderbolt from the blue shattering his heart. Minying was an upright and passionate young man who could no longer tolerate his father's shameless deeds. They, father and son, broke up! The first wife fought with Ruifeng for the sake of her son, but unfortunately, she committed suicide by hitting the wall! The second concubine took the opportunity to abscond with a large amount of savings! Meilin's Fu Ge also gave Ruifeng a ruthless revenge! Zheng Bofu, the editor-in-chief of the Morning Bell newspaper, who had criticized Ruifeng the most fiercely, saw Ruifeng's scandal on the spot. One ruthless blow after another swept in like a gale! Causing Ruifeng to be filled with regret, hate, disappointment, and pain. All of this prompted him to embark on the path of suicide! Before he committed suicide, he angrily killed Yuhou, who only knew how to flatter and be selfish, at the same time! The incident occurred on a cold and bleak night.

### Arts Scene

— Xin Juan

After Ma Xubobang's "Opium War" was declared stopped from filming, he immediately began writing the script for "Hanshan Night Rain." The review committee believed the plot of this film was absurd and refused to allow it to be filmed.

Ji Qinian, due to unsuccessful touring performances, and seeing the popularity of stage plays, is preparing to try it out as well. The planned play is "Storm in the City," with Bai Yun and Zheng Zhong as potential partners. The location and date are yet to be determined.

"Retired star" Yang Naimei is recently planning a comeback, teaming up with composer Xuan Gang to organize the New Voice Troupe. Their first production will be an excerpt from "Dream of the Red Chamber" titled "Wang Xifeng Plots in the Acacia Bureau."

The Chinese Art Troupe's "Bi Ji Wu" is an adaptation of "The Peacock Flies Southeast." This is the first new play by the Chinese Art Troupe since performing at Longmen, and also Director Hu's directorial debut.

Cai Jinglu's Chinese Drama Troupe is performing at the Carlton Theater for a scheduled month. After the period, they will seek another location, likely Paris or the League of Nations.

The Hongbao Theater, since the Unnamed Drama Troupe's performance, has been silent for half a year. Starting in June, it will be taken over by the Modern Drama Troupe of Xie Xing Company. Their first production is "Wandering Goose," written by Xiao Lin and directed by Jiang Ming. Rehearsals are complete and it will premiere on the evening of the 6th. The play tells the story of an orphan who is insulted by a snob, her parents and lover are murdered, and she eventually avenges herself in humiliation before dying. Five acts with scene changes, quite intense. Long practiced.

### Listening to Wang Yan Yu Speak, The Pearl Pagoda

— Long practiced

Wang Yanyu and Wang Jingsheng, husband and wife, are recently performing "The Pearl Pagoda" at the Nanjing bookstore. The script is best known as the one compiled by the late ballad master Ma Rufei, which has been refined over time by scholars and literati, becoming increasingly perfect. The lyrics are clear and beautiful, appreciated by both refined and popular tastes. The Wang couple are using this script as a basis, and adding their own insights to it, so the performance is like pearls falling on a jade plate, with unique sound and rhythm. The characters in the story, whether they are male roles, female roles, painted-face roles or comedic roles, are all fitting and lifelike. I went to listen the other day, and they were performing the scene where Fang Qing disguises himself as a Taoist priest and enters the Chen Yushi's garden, preparing to sing Taoist songs to test the lady. His pronunciation is clear, his dialogue is smooth, and his jokes and songs are all just right. I secretly think that even if Ma Rufei were alive, he wouldn't be much better. Wang has a daughter named Xiao Ying, whose singing voice is round and skillful at singing opening pieces and songs. Her fresh and youthful voice is also quite good. It is said that the section where Fang Xiang sees the lady for the second time in the entire Pearl Pagoda is the most exciting, so the audience is particularly large.

(20) Mao Jianqiu

Mao Jianqiu is the second daughter of Mao Yunke. Her appearance is not very beautiful, but she is clever and good at acting. Occasionally, she can also perform one or two singing roles. Although she has not yet risen to the upper echelons and compete with the female performers in the former capital who can lead troupes, she is included in new plays and is quite appreciated by the popular audience. She is a promising talent. However, after performing in Shanghai for only a few years, she married Wang Chunbai, an old male role performer who was on the same stage as her, and followed her husband, tying herself to Wang Chunbai and performing with him in other places. However, her name was placed below Wang Chunbai's, and she became his appendage, and her fame was not as great as before. When Mao Yunke used the stage name "Seven Lamps" and became famous throughout the Jiangnan region for singing female roles, she and Xiao Zihe were like the two great powers of Jin and Chu, taking turns dominating the singing stage. After her beauty faded, she switched to singing old male roles, and her reputation gradually declined. Her later years were even more difficult and downcast. In the past, her daughter Jianpei had great hope of rising up, but she died of poisoning while she was at her peak. By the time Jianqiu became famous, she destroyed her own future. The year before last, Mao Yunke joined the Gengxin Stage and had already been reduced to a minor supporting role. Looking back on the past, it is unbearable to recall. Therefore, in describing Jianqiu, it adds infinite vicissitudes to Mao Yunke! (End of this article)

### Sharing the Same Boat Through Storms

— He Jia Zhi

(5) Reciprocity

A Xing suddenly understood, the young master was trying his best in the fields. The master and servant began to discuss. According to Wei Cheng's idea, these few acres should be planted with rice, but A Xing insisted that they should be sown with cotton seeds. Wei Cheng said, "I want to improve the farming this year while I'm at home, don't oppose me. Our family of eight should estimate how much grain we need for the whole year." A Xing said, "The eldest mistress has passed away, now there are only seven people. We have three farmhands, two maids, the second mistress and the young master, isn't that seven people?" Wei Cheng said, "What about Miss Cuizhen?" A Xing, refuted by Wei Cheng, hurriedly patted his forehead and admitted his mistake repeatedly. But after a while, he retorted fearlessly, "Young master, this new method of farming is unreliable. Two or three years ago, there was a family behind Huagang who also used the new method of farming, planting only three or four cotton plants with a gap of one or two feet. Later, forty or fifty mu of land were abandoned by twenty or thirty mu. The people in the countryside said that his land was infected with epilepsy. Young master, don't be fooled." Wei Cheng laughed, "Even if the experiment fails, it's still considered a failure. We should experiment a second and third time."

Wei Cheng was still planning on paper, where to plant cotton and where to plant rice. He also went out to see the ox he was raising. The ox's hind legs were covered in manure. Wei Cheng complained to A Xing and the others, "Because it is a beast, it has no ability to clean itself, so it all depends on you to take care of it. When you want it to work, you can't wait for it to put in more effort, but now that it's idle, you don't care about it at all, that's not right." A Xing smiled and nodded, and hurriedly fetched a bucket of clean water to wash the ox. Wei Cheng went inside, but A Xing was still tending to the ox. Then he heard someone giggle. A Xing lowered his head and looked out from between his legs. It was none other than Magpie closing the door. A Xing was a little unconvinced, and unexpectedly splashed the water from the brush over, drenching Magpie's face and body. Magpie began to scold. Just at this moment, someone walked in from outside the door. This person's arrival temporarily stopped the dispute between A Xing and Magpie, but added some trouble for Wei Cheng. (95)
