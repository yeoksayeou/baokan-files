### The German Elite Fortieth Division Fails to Capture Leningrad; Soviet Forces on the Southern Front Launch Counter-offensive for Three Days; Two Sections of Important German Transportation Lines Severed

Berlin, 10th (Haitong News Agency) – According to well-informed sources, there have been large-scale battles on both wings of the Eastern Front in the past week. Fierce fighting has been taking place in the northern wing, around Murmansk and Lapland. In the southern wing, battles have also been fought from the Donets Basin to the Sea of Azov, Crimea, and the Black Sea.

London, 10th (Reuters) – According to Moscow reports last night, the troops under the command of General Timoshenko, commander-in-chief of the Soviet Southern Front, have been fighting in the Kursk area for three days and have severed two sections of the German army's important transportation lines. The Kharkov railway has been cut off both above and below Belgorod, and fierce fighting is still ongoing thirty miles south of Belgorod on the north-south trunk road. As for the Leningrad front in the north, the German army has been steadily pushed back. According to a report in yesterday's newspapers, the German side launched an offensive against Leningrad from the flank with the elite Fortieth Division for two months, but has now completely failed. Although land transportation to Leningrad has been cut off, fortunately, there is a motor road on the ice of Lake Ladoga, on which the city has been able to rely in order to be defended to this day. Furthermore, according to an article published by a German officer in a Berlin newspaper, the main Soviet forces remained intact after the winter battles, and the number of Soviet tanks in the rear was far beyond imagination, numbering in the tens of thousands, of which the German side only engaged a portion. It is said that only one-tenth of these Soviet tanks were damaged in the winter battles.

Vichy, 9th (Havas) – Intense fighting has resumed in the Donets region on the Eastern Front in recent days. Initially, Timoshenko led his troops to attack the Axis powers, eventually switching from defense to offense. The German positions on the right bank of the Donets have therefore been strengthened. Yesterday, the German army again used large numbers of tanks along the railway from Stalingrad to Novocherkassk, advancing towards Lovanja, and have already occupied several strongholds. However, all of these are only preliminary military actions, and the German army has no intention of deep penetration. Military circles here are widely spreading rumors that the Axis powers will launch a spring offensive on the 20th of this month, but according to well-informed sources, the preparations for the Southern Front are still underway, and the aforementioned date seems to be premature. In general, the spring offensive will be launched in the last ten days of June, around the time of last year's outbreak of the German-Soviet war. Although the weather has improved in the past four or five days, the roads are still muddy, and it is still difficult for mechanized units to move freely.

### The United States and the Authorities in Martinique are Conducting Important Negotiations, Demanding They Not Be Used by the Axis Powers, and Presenting Three Honorable Conditions

Washington, 10th (Havas) – The State Department announced today that President Roosevelt has dispatched Vice Admiral Hoover, commander of the Caribbean Sea area, and State Department representative Le Rou, to Martinique, a French possession, to negotiate an agreement with French High Commissioner Vice Admiral Robert to resolve the issue of the French West Indies. The US policy is as follows: 1. The French flag will continue to be flown in the French West Indies; 2. France will retain its sovereignty over the islands; 3. Vice Admiral Robert will remain the highest authority on the islands, but must guarantee that the islands will not assist the Axis powers. In addition, the United States is prepared to guarantee all the rights and interests of the French islands, as well as their economic livelihood. As for all the funds of the islands, they will be reserved for the future use of the French people. According to recent reports, the negotiations are progressing smoothly, and both sides are faithfully fulfilling the various agreements previously reached between the United States and Vice Admiral Robert. Various supplies from the American continent to the French West Indies have also continued uninterrupted.

New York, 10th (Havas) – The New York Times commented today on the negotiations between the United States and the authorities of Martinique, stating that the United States does not intend to send troops to Martinique or other French territories, and that both sides are conducting the negotiations with great sincerity. The conditions presented by the United States to the High Commissioner of Martinique are all honorable conditions.

Washington, 10th (Reuters) – Martinique currently has three French warships stationed there, the auxiliary cruiser "Boufflers", and several small vessels, as well as seven oil tankers and three thousand sailors. This situation constitutes a practical problem.

Washington, 10th (Reuters) – The French islands in the Caribbean Sea include Martinique, Guadeloupe, Marie-Galante, and Saint Martin, with a total area of 1,777 square kilometers and a population of approximately 310,000. Martinique is the largest.

### Regarding Madagascar, Britain and the United States Reached an Agreement Long Ago

Vichy, 9th (Havas) – Political figures here recently stated that US Army Chief of Staff General Marshall visited Britain earlier to hold talks with British military authorities, and that the leaders of Germany and Italy met in Salzburg afterward. Both sides made important decisions. Although the content has not been officially announced, it can be asserted that the various events that have occurred in the past week have been influenced by the results of the aforementioned two meetings. Regarding the Madagascar issue, Churchill himself admitted that the plan had been agreed upon months before, and was only implemented after General Marshall met with British military authorities. Therefore, when British troops attacked the island, the United States provided political support. This can be seen in the note delivered by US Chargé d'Affaires Duke to the French government on the 5th of this month, a few hours after British troops landed in Courrier Bay. The note stated that "Although the United States is not participating militarily in the Madagascar event, the US government fully supports Britain's actions in spirit." This clarifies two main points: 1. Britain and the United States are fully cooperating in spirit; 2. Although both sides have reached a political understanding, in fact only British troops are used to invade Madagascar. As for the international consequences caused by this note, opinions differ, as emphasis on the former or the latter will have two completely different consequences. The French government submitted a reply today, stating that France does not wish to be the first to initiate action regarding the final stage of relations between the United States and France. By the end of Wednesday, relations between the United States and France had become amicable, indicating that the Madagascar event is unlikely to cause significant political consequences.

This number is the maximum that the Indian army can expand.

### Air Force to Occupy Important Position in Future European War

Stockholm, 10th (Havas) – According to military observers here, the air force will occupy a key position in the future European war. Germany and Italy have a total of 19,000 aircraft, of which 17,000 are concentrated in Europe.

### The United States Remains Silent on the Situation in the Coral Sea; Australia and New Zealand are Determined to Fight to the End to Defend Their Homelands

Lisbon, 10th (Haitong News Agency) – Washington: The US Navy is remaining strictly silent on the losses of the US fleet in the Battle of the Coral Sea. The communique issued by Washington last night only stated that the publication of the US side's losses must wait until this information is of no use to the other party. It may be recalled that the Washington communique on Friday stated that the losses suffered by the US Navy would be announced after the necessary information was obtained. Therefore, the Navy Department's strict silence has aroused concerns in the US naval community. The recent communique issued by Washington did not express any opinion on the facts and figures of US warship losses transmitted by Tokyo, only stating that "according to the information obtained so far," the US Navy has not lost any aircraft carriers or battleships.

### Europe's Largest Crystal Gate to Be Completed in Three Years

Vichy, 10th (Haitong News Agency) – French Minister of Transport, Tiborg, stated that the construction of Europe's largest aqualock is expected to be completed by the end of 1945. The lock is located in the Rhone River basin, near the city of Bellegarde. Its reservoir is 23 kilometers long and has an area of 300 meters, which can increase water power by half. Some of the electricity will be used to power the trains of Paris, Lyon, Marseille, and Nice. The lock began construction in 1937. Although it was not bombed during the outbreak of the war, it was flooded, which will delay its completion by two years.

### The Alaskan Highway (3)

The most prominent event in the first movement was Churchill's signing of the lease for the Atlantic naval base on Downing Street on March 27th of last year. However, looking back at the chronicle of the United States over the past year or so, it is clear that the Americans have done a lot of work on defense arrangements.

Since the outbreak of the war, the Americans have repeatedly declared their ability to fight on both oceans, so all arrangements were first focused on the Panama Canal Zone. This canal zone is the thoroughfare between the two oceans, so why not emphasize it? But if we want to properly defend this canal, the most important work is still in the West Indies. In the military vision of the Americans, these islands are seen as "a necklace of North and South America". Necklace is such a poetic term! Imagine a beautiful lady with a string of jewels on her delicate neck, which certainly adds a lot of charm, and it is only natural that she cherishes this necklace.

This necklace starts from the Bahamas in the southeast of Florida in the United States, including four large islands such as Cuba and Jamaica and countless islands, extending southwest in a semicircle to Trinidad. In the defense of this island area, Trinidad is the most important; because if the Panama defense area is the target of attack, attacking Mexico from the north and Brazil from the south, this small island is just the first to bear the brunt. In addition, this small island is also a large oil area, and the United Kingdom obtains at least 8% of its oil from here.

We cannot say that this is a fantasy. Please refer to the map. Directly opposite Trinidad on the east coast of the Atlantic Ocean is Dakar in French Africa. To put it more clearly, the African newsletter of the 16th of last month said that the Germans were urging the Vichy government in North Africa to rush to build a railway to prepare for bypassing the Sahara Desert and reaching Dakar in West Africa. The North African railway plan, which the French had been clamoring for for forty years, has not yet been realized; why are the Germans busy having the French rush to build this railway in today's military chaos? Isn't this precisely an explanation of a prelude to attacking the Americas? The Americans are not stupid birds, so how could they not take precautions?

Speaking of this, we can also see that the entire South America is also a major concern for the United States; because in the northeast corner of South America, Brazil, there is a small port called Natal, which is even closer to Dakar in Africa than Trinidad, and is vulnerable to attack; if the United States wants to take care of its own security, it has to unite North and South America to defend together. Her neighbor Mexico, of course, is willing to help each other and has no problem. As for the countries of Latin America, there are a few places that cannot but make the United States worry a little. Brazil, Peru, Chile, and a group of small countries to the north of them can be said to have no problems; only Argentina and the small Uruguay seem to be a little tricky. However, according to the US-Argentina trade agreement of last August, it is clear that the United States cannot allow the Nazis to gain power in South America; because this "agreement" includes 100 million gold yuan worth of strategic metal raw materials per year, which are transported from Argentina to the United States via Mexico, and it is guaranteed by Mexico that these raw materials are only for the use of the United Nations defense in the Western Hemisphere.

The above explains the United States' various arrangements for Panama, the West Indies, and the various countries in the Latin American region of South America as a whole. This is a very busy job. However, the Americans believe that this is only a part of the defense; therefore, since April of the same year, the United States has also paid attention to the defense work of Greenland, Iceland, and Newfoundland, these three large islands.

Greenland is an island belonging to Denmark. The entire land, like Alaska, is in the Arctic Circle north of 60 degrees north latitude. Although the island has 850,000 square miles, the largest island in the world, it is covered with ice and snow all year round and is also an iceberg; of which 600,000 to 700,000 square miles are simply ice caves. From an ordinary perspective, such a region seems to have no need for arrangement, but this place is only 1,300 miles away from the United Kingdom and no more than 1,400 or 1,500 miles away from New York. It is simply a military key area in the North Atlantic, so how can we not arrange it? Moreover, Greenland produces more than 50,000 tons of cryolite every year; what is cryolite? It is an alloy of aluminum, sodium, and fluorine, which is precisely the raw material for refining aluminum, so how can it not be considered important?

### Romania's National Day; Demonstrations Held Nationwide Demanding Recovery of Lost Territory; Slogans Shouted Tearing Up the Arbitration Agreement; High-Ranking German Generals Participate in Military Parade

Bucharest, 9th (Havas) – Tomorrow is Romania's National Day, and demonstrations will be held to demand the recovery of the Outer Transylvania region.

German General Lister and other foreign officials will also come here to participate in the National Day celebrations.

Because Romania's economic situation and industrial and commercial conditions are not exactly the same as those of other countries, it is necessary to seek other solutions. In short, Romania's economic policy must be completely in line with the interests of the Romanian people. This is our right, just as our nation demands to obtain the necessary borders to fulfill our mission.

### Europe's Largest Crystal Sluice Gate to Be Completed in Three Years

Vichy, 10th (Haitong News Agency) – French Minister of Transport Tibuk said that Europe's largest sluice gate is expected to be completed by the end of 1945. The sluice gate is located in the Rhone River basin, near the city of Bergerac. Its reservoir is 23 kilometers long and covers an area of 300 meters, which can increase water power by half. Some of the electricity will be used to electrify the trains of Paris, Lyon, Marseille, and Nice. Construction of the sluice gate began in 1937. Although it was not bombed during the outbreak of war, it was flooded, which delayed its completion by two years.

This canal zone is the channel for travel between the two oceans, so why not emphasize it? But to properly defend this canal, the most important work is still in the West Indies.

### US Economic Aid to South America: Draft Massive Plan, Peruvian President Inspects US Wartime Industries, Argentina Actively Expands Merchant Fleet

Washington, 9th (Havas) – It is learned that the US authorities are currently drafting a massive plan for economic aid to Latin American countries.

### North African Sandstorms and Heat: Fighting Stalled, Drinking Water Transport Becomes a Problem

Berlin, 10th (Reuter) – According to the German High Command, the fighting in North Africa has been relatively quiet in the past week. As spring turns to summer, the North African battlefield is plagued by sandstorms and intense heat, with temperatures often exceeding 40 degrees Celsius. The steel plates on tanks are as hot as fire, and the cooling water in the engine compartments must be frequently changed. Therefore, the water supply and transportation problems for the troops are the most important issues in desert warfare. In this difficult situation, both sides are still engaged in reconnaissance activities and exchanging artillery fire. Attempts by advancing British tank units were repelled by the powerful artillery fire of the German-Italian defense forces. Axis aircraft continued to bomb British motor convoys, supply depots, the supply line of Cyrenaica, and the desert railway near Solun. British aircraft parked at airfields were destroyed. Axis long-range aircraft carried out two air raids on the port and railway facilities of Alexandria, with great success. The Italian shipping lanes to North Africa have not encountered any obstacles, with only two attacks by British aircraft and submarines, which were repelled. Axis convoys safely reached their destinations.

### Madagascar (4)

To cope with the transportation of these abundant mineral resources, the development of transportation is a matter of utmost urgency. The French spared no expense in building railways and bridges, and now, at a glance, it seems that there is a simple transportation network. First of all, telephone and telegraph lines have been erected, riverbeds have been dredged, and the major ports are being planned for improvement. The main railway on the island, in addition to the route from Tananarive to the east coast, completed the Fianarantsoa to the east coast trunk line in 1935, with a total length of 170 kilometers. The highway system on the island is quite developed, with a total length of over 2,000 kilometers. The most economically and militarily valuable of these are the highways from Diego Suarez to Ambilobe and from Tananarive to Ihosy. The former is 137 kilometers long and is the main route for the current British offensive, while the latter is 498 kilometers long and is the main transportation route traversing the south, with significant political implications.

The coastline of Madagascar is approximately 5,000 kilometers long. The main ports are mostly located in the northeast, but with the exception of Diego Suarez, Tamatave, and Majunga, which have some modern facilities, the rest are of little value. Diego Suarez is located at the mouth of Courier Bay, a necessary route to the Indian Ocean. This port has a deep and wide bay and good docks. Its terrain is somewhat similar to Brest. This port was fortified by the late General Joffre and is strategically important, but its economic value is minimal due to its distance from agricultural production areas and the continuous mountains. Exports from this port include leather, coffee, spices, cattle, and rubber. The island has a population of 13,000.

Tamatave is a magnificent port with well-equipped docks and cranes. However, in 1927, it was completely destroyed by a hurricane. It was later rebuilt with French loans. Before the disaster, Tamatave had an annual export volume of 300,000 tons. It is Madagascar's only port of entry and exit and is an important hub connecting the central plateau.

When the French first took over Madagascar, the total trade volume was less than 18 million francs, but in recent years it has surged to over 500 million francs. The main exports are rice, coffee, grain, and mineral products. Small-scale factories have recently been established in eastern Madagascar, mostly milling and refining industries, but heavy industry, especially industries related to national defense, is lacking.

The French have invested huge sums of capital in the development of this island. The financial centers on the island are the Bank of Madagascar, the Indian Ocean Bank, and the Construction Bank. The major enterprises and large-scale trading companies are concentrated in the Tananarive area, making Tananarive not only the cultural and political capital but also the economic center.

Travel Anecdotes

Having stayed too long on the central plateau of Madagascar, the residents wanted to get some fresh air. People would naturally remember Antsirabe. It was August, the best season for travel. On the road from Tananarive to the east, you could see groups of tourists being carried away by trains. There were the ruling class whites and the wealthy Hova merchants, but naturally, the poor could not afford it. Through the train window, you could see the blue sky covering the lonely and towering mountain peaks. The train entered the low-lying lakes and swamps of the east coast, where dense aquatic plants grew. A sea breeze blew, contrasting with the lush green rice fields in the distance. Later, the train entered the continuous mountain range, and what appeared before you was the endless, monotonous scenery: steep slopes, rapid streams, rushing waterfalls, and the endless coffee plantations. Perhaps you were a little tired of the monotonous colors, especially since the dazzling and scorching sunlight constantly shone in through the windows. You might regret taking such a boring trip. You might think it would have been better to stay in Tananarive! Naturally, this long journey would be disappointing, but please bear with it. The train sped through Ifanadiana, Ambohimasoa, and one more station, and then the popular hot spring resort finally arrived.

Your eyes would immediately be attracted by the novel scenery around you, and you would finally cheer up. You would seem to forget the fatigue of the long journey. You walked along the quiet avenue, with flowering mimosa on both sides. Through the low trees, you would occasionally see clusters of dry grass and blooming roses. The faint mooing of cattle could be heard in the air from time to time, and the church bells drifted softly from afar, falling into the quiet wilderness. All of this sounded so亲切 and comforting, as if you had returned to an old and simple village. As today gradually darkened, the shadows of dusk gradually expanded, and your surroundings were immersed in a hazy mist until the sky was completely heavy and dark.

On this plateau 1,580 feet above sea level, the air is fresh. The average annual temperature here is 17 degrees Celsius, and it rarely exceeds 24 degrees even in the height of summer. In the early morning, before the sun comes out, the fields are often covered with a layer of white frost, shining like silver in the distance.

Because of the high altitude, those proliferating bacteria cannot assert their power. People who are tormented by mosquitoes all day long in the low-lying areas no longer have to worry about it here. The water quality of the hot springs here is extremely good, and the number of people coming here for treatment every year is endless. There are also specialized doctors in charge of guidance here, making it the best place to rest. The French often proudly consider this their southern Vichy.

### Public Concession Resident Certificates to Be Issued Starting Today: Issuance to Take Two Months, Overview of District Baoshang Division

Public Concession resident certificates will begin to be issued today (11th). The various police stations will distribute application forms to each baoshang district, then down the line to each baoshang chief, jiachang chief, and household head. After receiving the application forms, residents of each household can fill them out item by item, then have them stamped and guaranteed by the household head and jiachang chief. Then, together with the required two resident certificate photos, they can be submitted to the police station in charge. The resident certificate can be obtained three days later.

French Concession Preparations

As for the French Concession, residential identity cards, which are similar in nature to resident certificates, will also be issued. These cards are currently being printed, and will be issued as soon as they are printed. The organization similar to the baoshang chief has been thoroughly investigated east of Songshan Road and is gradually being implemented westward. At present, the authorities have no plans to issue resident certificates to Japanese and foreign residents in this city. However, the Municipal Council's Baoshang Committee is considering the matter.

Number of Baoshang

Regarding the organization of baoshang, the Public Concession is divided into seven police station districts. Each police station district is further divided into several baoshang districts, which are then divided into several Lianbao, Bao, Jia, and households in sequence. The approximate number of baoshang divisions in each police station has been obtained and recorded below: The Central Police Station district is divided into 4 baoshang districts, 35 Lianbao, 600 Bao, and over 6,000 Jia; the Lao Zha Police Station district is divided into 5 baoshang districts, 55 Lianbao, over 800 Bao, and over 7,000 Jia; the Chengdu Road Police Station district is divided into 4 baoshang districts, 60 Lianbao, over 600 Bao, and over 5,000 Jia; the Xin Zha Police Station district is divided into 5 baoshang districts, 50 Lianbao, over 800 Bao, and over 8,000 Jia; the Gordon Road Police Station district is divided into 5 baoshang districts, over 70 Lianbao, over 700 Bao, and over 8,000 Jia; the Jing'an Temple Police Station district is divided into 4 baoshang districts, 40 Lianbao, over 400 Bao, and over 4,000 Jia; the Putuo Road Police Station district is divided into 5 baoshang districts, 94 Lianbao, over 700 Bao, and over 5,000 Jia.

### Public Works Department General Manager Okazaki Broadcasts Last Night, Explaining Reasons for Tax Increases

According to a statement released by the Public Works Department Information Office, Mr. Katsuo Okazaki, the General Manager of the Public Works Department, broadcast in English and Japanese at 8:45 PM and 9:15 PM last night (Sunday, May 10th) on the Great Shanghai Broadcasting Station, respectively, to discuss the Public Works Department's financial situation for this year and explain the reasons for increasing taxes. The translated text of his speech is as follows:

Balancing Revenue and Expenditure

"Tonight, I would like to take a short time to discuss a matter of deep concern to all residents within the Public Concession, both directly and indirectly. This is the issue of the Bureau's financial situation for this year. I am honored to serve as the General Manager of the Public Works Department this year. The duty of the Public Works Department is to use funds collected from land taxes, municipal general taxes, license fees, and other various taxes paid by you to maintain an organization that can provide various services within its authority for your benefit. The current financial situation of the Bureau has evolved from various circumstances that have occurred in the past. I can certainly describe in detail all the circumstances that have occurred in the past, but I know that what you are most concerned about are the most immediate issues, especially regarding this year's (1942) budget. Regarding this issue, there are two things to pay attention to separately. The first is that the total amount of both regular income and regular expenditure exceeds one hundred million yuan, which is a first in the history of Shanghai. The second, and perhaps more important, is that the total amount of regular income for a year is not smaller than the total amount of expenditure required for this year, which is also the first time this has been seen in nearly thirteen years. In other words, this year's revenue and expenditure can be balanced, which is indeed no small matter. Shanghai has not suffered from the ravages of war like many other places in the world. We undoubtedly deeply feel the repercussions felt in other parts of the world, and in this year when almost the entire world is struggling, government or local authorities, whether directly or indirectly related, are not always able to raise sufficient funds from regular tax revenue to meet this year's expenses.

Practicing Thrift

The fact that the Bureau's revenue and expenditure can be offset can be said to be a very satisfactory situation. The reason why we can achieve this satisfactory situation is due to two main factors. First, all parts of the Bureau's services are doing their best to practice thrift. Second, the revision of the Public Concession's Paper Ordinance allows us to develop untapped tax sources without placing an excessive burden on direct taxpayers. You may think that an annual expenditure of one hundred million yuan does not indicate that the Bureau has made any obvious efforts in terms of reducing expenditure. However, in fact, the total regular expenditure in 1936 was 26,728,764 yuan, while this year's budget expenditure is 100,457,090 yuan, an increase of 291 percent. You should know that half of the Public Works Department's expenditure depends on the narrowness of the area under its jurisdiction, and half depends on the size of the population it serves. However, the area under the Bureau's jurisdiction has not changed in the past six years, while the population it serves has increased by about 50 percent. The Bureau feels the skyrocketing cost of living just as you do. There is nothing that you buy with money that is not a bulk purchase for the Bureau, and the families that need the Bureau's attention now are much larger than in 1936. Therefore, if we can handle it well, and expenditures only increase by about 300 percent in the fall when the cost of living has increased by about ten times, I think it is very reasonable for the Bureau to believe that it has practiced thrift at this time.

Imposing New Taxes

Now, I should also explain the Bureau's imposition of several new taxes. There are three new taxes in total: a telephone tax, a 10% tax on bills for food, accommodation, and entertainment in hotels and restaurants, and a 2% retail sales tax. There are also several other taxes, all of which are consumer-based and have been considered very carefully. However, the difficulties encountered in imposing them seem insurmountable, so we have had to increase the rates of land tax and municipal general tax to increase revenue and balance the budget.

Scope of Collection

In the past, it has been mentioned that Shanghai's position is very special in terms of its relationship with the Chinese government, so its financial management has also been affected. In other countries, municipal governments can often obtain large sums of money from the national treasury to fund police, education, and sanitation. Shanghai is not like that. The Public Works Department can only collect taxes based on very old property regulations, and the types of taxes it is allowed to collect are extremely limited. On the other hand, in addition to paying for matters within the scope of municipal affairs, it must also pay for large expenditures that should actually be the responsibility of the government rather than the municipal government. Although we have the right to expand the scope of taxation according to the newly revised Temporary Organization Law, the Bureau's expenses outside the scope of municipal affairs have not been relieved. For example, in this year's budget, the Bureau must bear a huge sum to cover the expenses of maintaining the Ward Road Jail, which is a very obvious example.

Implementation Issues

There are two more points to mention regarding the new taxes. First, regarding procedural issues, in the past, new taxes could not be implemented, or old taxes could not be increased, without the approval of the annual taxpayers' meeting. This annual meeting has now been suspended. However, according to the new Organizational Law, any newly established taxes should be submitted to the special advisory committee organized by taxpayers for approval after the Bureau decides to levy them. This procedure has already been followed. I can now tell you that the Special Advisory Committee has unanimously approved the Bureau's proposal to levy new taxes, which is very gratifying. Second, regarding the implementation of the retail sales tax and the tax on bills for food, accommodation, etc. in hotels and restaurants, it is obviously very difficult to collect these two types of taxes. However, I earnestly ask you to pay attention, if not for anything else, for your own benefit, you should fully cooperate with the Bureau. If you find any concealment or evasion, you should report it to the relevant authorities immediately.

The Bureau has received the understanding and assistance of the Japanese authorities and is doing its utmost to revive local industry and encourage trade so that Shanghai can regain its prosperity and residents can easily pay the new taxes mentioned above. This should not need to be elaborated on.

In the temporary budget, we have included approximately 5 million yuan for flood prevention projects. We certainly cannot predict to what extent this project can be developed this summer to prevent the expected flooding caused by heavy rain, but we can always hope that this year's flooding can be reduced, and next year's flooding will be further reduced.

I sincerely hope that we can safely get through this year's financial situation in Shanghai, and that the local situation will prosper, so that the current tax rates will be gradually reduced, which is not far off. Goodbye."

### Corn Temporarily Suspended for Milling

Supply Suspended Starting This Week

Rice shops in both concessions are selling foreign rice today. The supply of corn will be suspended starting this week. Since the Public Works Department's Grain Management Committee advocated eating corn, the milling work has been entrusted to Reiss & Co. After crushing, it is supplied to the rice shops, which can be picked up from the warehouse at 195 Suzhou Road. Now, the crushed corn has been completely sold out, but there is still a considerable amount of whole corn in the warehouse, which is prepared for supplying feed for the dairy cows of the milk shed and will no longer be used as food. Therefore, the suspension of sales this time does not mean that the corn has been sold out.

### French Police Pay Attention to Kidnappers, Striving to Eliminate Them All at Once to Reunite Families

The French police authorities are paying close attention to this case and have ordered the handling detectives to handle it carefully, pursue the accomplices who are at large based on the confessions of the criminals, and strive to eliminate them all at once to prevent future troubles. On the one hand, they will track down kidnapped children in order to retrieve them and reunite families.

If the occupants of such houses postpone obtaining the license for the quarter from April to June of this year until after this date, in addition to paying the license fee of 9 yuan for the quarter, they must also pay a late fee of 5 yuan, for a total of 14 yuan. All owners who rent out part of their houses as residences, where the house has no separate entrance and rent taxes have not been collected separately, must obtain a sublease license. This is specially announced for general information.

### Situation of Parents' Day Family Reunion at the YWCA Nursery

Families Gathered Together Filled with Love

In the year when the First World War broke out, Ms. Jarvis of Philadelphia, USA, in order to promote respect for the family and mother, and hoping that adults and children would expand their love for the family and mother, suggested that a day be designated as Mother's Day. Her sincere suggestion was immediately supported and sympathized by President Wilson, and May 9th of that year was designated as the first Mother's Day in the United States, and it was announced that the second Sunday in May of each year thereafter would be Mother's Day. This custom was later introduced to China. Until last year, some Christian churches believed that the status of parents was equally important, so they changed the Mother's Day that originated in the United States to the Parents' Day in China. Yesterday was the second birthday of the Chinese Parents' Day.

Parents and Children Gathered Together

The nursery run by the YWCA, in order to give the boys and girls entrusted to its care and their parents a happy gathering, held a family reunion yesterday at the site at the corner of Weihaiwei Road and Muyu Ming Road, allowing parents and children to receive the grace of Parents' Day together. At 3:30, the living room was crowded with fifty or sixty parents, some of whom were talking about the lives of their children in the nursery, some were criticizing how clean and tidy the furnishings in the nursery were, and some were expressing their gratitude for the warm service of the staff in the nursery in their conversations.

Performing Singing Innocent and Lively

After the chairman briefly explained the significance of Parents' Day and the purpose of holding the family reunion, sixteen children entered the living room in a line to the sound of a clanging piano, bowed and sang the "Welcome Song". This team used innocence and beauty to welcome hard-working parents. This was followed by the "Rooster Dance" and "We All Go to the Nursery". The "Little Mouse" program was full of laughter. The "Military Band" was the finale, with a total of twelve people working together. The refreshments were simple, but very lovely. Dozens of children had previously folded many small flower baskets from five-colored paper, each basket containing biscuits and sweets. When the children handed these baskets one by one to their parents, they sweetly called out "Dad" or "Mom". The parents regarded these sweets and biscuits as better than delicacies and surpassing everything.

### Parents' Day at the YWCA

The YWCA Nursery held a family reunion on Parents' Day yesterday. The children's families in the institute gathered together, rejoicing and rejoicing, and the love of flesh and blood overflowed in words.

### Yesterday's Friendly Football Match: Hong Team Wins Zhen Dan Four to One

A friendly football match, Hong Team vs. Zhen Dan, took place at Zhen Dan at 5:00 PM yesterday. The audience was crowded and the situation was quite lively. The Hong Team gathered the best talents in Shanghai and was very strong. Yesterday, due to the incomplete number of people, only nine people responded to the battle at first, but the offensive was still strong. Zhen Dan's Bassi Baoga did not play. Gao Baduski, who had just come to Shanghai from Tianjin, joined the battle in military uniform. Not long after the start of the game, Zhen Dan's Wu Xie defected and gave away a point, losing one goal first. Erdoski then kissed the ball with his hand in the penalty area and was penalized for 12 yards. Jia Youliang of the Hong Team operated the knife and hit the net again. By the time Dai Linjing scored, the first half was over. The Hong Team was superior with three to zero. After changing sides, the Hong Team added a Li Xi to the central defense line, but still only ten people were fighting. Zhen Dan's center forward Augs Terre achieved success in a foreign land and pulled back a goal. However, in less than two minutes, Hong Team's A Dai returned the color, becoming four to one. After that, Zhen Dan's counterattack was ineffective, and the Hong Team took the opportunity to move around, and Yuan Yintian and Han Longhai successively scored. When the statutory time arrived, the Hong Team won Zhen Dan by a large margin of six to one.

Economic Special Issue

### Chinese Stocks Hover Downstream: Whether the Weekend Will Turn the Tide Will Be Known This Week

In the past week, the Chinese stock market has been sluggish, with a weak trend and light trading. The current market prices have mostly reached saturation points after frequent weekly gains, and most bulls have been selling off, resulting in ample chips. In addition, general commodity prices are weak, and the collapse of yarn and cloth prices has also had an impact. Therefore, the trend has been one-sided this week.

Regarding Chinese stocks in the past week, New Pharmaceutical stocks have a large number of circulating chips and frequent trading, making them important cells in the Chinese stock market. Their rise is fast, and their fall is also fast. For example, New Asia's new shares fell from 36 yuan to 33.5 yuan. China-France's new shares fell from 62 yuan to 58 yuan due to the selling off of those who made profits. Shenghua's preferred shares were rumored that the company authorities would not allow the exchange of seals, and the market price suddenly fell, even to the point where there were funds but no buyers. Only Xinyi showed a strong trend. Department store stocks showed a stable trend. Wing On rose by 2.5 yuan at first due to the large number of seekers, and then slightly fell back. Sincere remained stable because it had already distributed dividends. The prices of China's underwear stocks were linked to the yarn market, and the factory orders plummeted on the weekend, causing the stock price to fall by more than 2 yuan, and there were still few buyers. In the industrial stock market, China Firecrackers and Nanyang Tobacco fell as soon as they rose. The new shares of the world were soft to around 71 yuan; the rest hovered and predicted. Financial stocks showed mixed results.

However, the one-sided situation often creates opportunities for new bulls; but whether the stabilization at the end of last week can be a trigger? Or are there still some surface issues? The outcome should be known this week.

### Reaching the End of Its Strength: The Bond Market Begins to Rise

In the past week, the range of fluctuations in the bond market has narrowed. The overall trend is also turning to firmness. The rising side accounted for four days throughout the week, which shows that the selling side has exhausted its momentum. On Monday, Type D bonds fell too much, and the empty side closed out profits and those who turned empty followed. The buying side also secretly increased its bets, so it rose 2 yuan on the same day the next day; on Wednesday, the selling side favored Type A bonds, and Type A bonds fell. For the next three days, the selling wind stopped, and the buying side watched quietly from the sidelines because it lost its opponent; the market only floated up and down, so the market atmosphere changed from lively to flat; on Saturday, it only rose and fell by a few cents. Silently observing the power of the selling side, it is thought that the current decline is the end of its strength.

### Foreign Stocks are Like Wet Wood: Brokers Steal Hats

Foreign stocks plummeted all the way last week; as we expected: Veteran bulls saw that the bubble had burst and hurriedly sought to depreciate and sell, but no one was willing to carry wet wood. Therefore, although the decline was fierce, there were few respondents; the total number of transactions throughout the week was reduced to about 120,000 shares, which can be said to be miserable.

In terms of individual stocks: textile stocks fell the most; mainly due to the authorities' saying that they would slightly use the factory's inventory, and the impact of the sharp drop in cotton yarn prices. Jardine Spinning broke the 40 yuan mark and once saw a low of 37 yuan; it fell by a huge 6.5 yuan from the previous week; China Textile also fell by 7.5 yuan, falling all the way to 20 yuan; Xinyi also fell by 6.5 yuan; among the small-value stocks, paper, Jardine Brewery, and Shanghai Woolen, etc. also fell sharply. However, in the industrial stock market, Kailuan British United; in the financial stock market, HSBC, Shanghai Banking Corporation, and Yangtze Banking Corporation; and various public utility stocks, were still stable, but there were few transactions. There were slight transactions in rubber stocks in the first half of the week, and there were no transactions in the second half of the week. Only low prices were seen on the floor.

The stock company organized by Chinese brokerage firms stipulates that it is absolutely forbidden to trade foreign registered stocks, and foreign companies are not allowed to participate in transactions; while the Chinese side's interest in foreign stocks is not as good as before. Those who have stocks say that the company's assets can be a guarantee; but the future is uncertain, and they don't know when they can rest easy. Therefore, the desire to sell is even more eager. Those who can slightly turn around in the middle are just general stock brokers secretly stealing hats.

### Factory Orders Rise and Fall Sharply: The Ability to Spread Rumors is Excellent

— All

The yarn and cloth market rose and fell sharply last week; the momentum was terrifying. At first, because East goods were expensive, the Cotton Industry Exchange was about to open, and there were rumors that movement permits had been approved; the rumor of a sell-off at the end of the previous week was suddenly eliminated, and the buying momentum of the bulls was strong again; the sales of various yarns and cloths saw a new peak; those who made profits from the bulls closed out one after another; all the favorable rumors also disappeared; in addition, after Wednesday, there was a saying that the price of cotton yarn was limited to buy, and people's hearts were greatly moved; the actual sales of cotton goods were extremely rare; the moldy season was approaching, and the hoarders all had the intention of coming out of the cage, so the market fell sharply, and the general blind bulls were caught off guard and in a panic. However, the 20-count Double Horse factory order fell all the way from a new high of 5,980 yuan to a low price of 4,800 yuan, but the spot drop was still light; because the yarn factories rarely opened for sale. The cloth market was weak, and the transaction volume was reduced due to the difficulty of movement; however, the overall situation was not glorious or disgraced.

At present, the trend of yarn and cloth, if observed according to seasonal changes, actual sales volume, financial situation, and the difficulty of movement, etc., seems difficult to advance in the short term; however, in terms of raw materials, costs, and the roots of spot goods, there is no very bad sign. After this sharp rise and fall, there may be a period of consolidation.

### The Currency Market is Soft

The US dollar ticket market has been trending downward this past week, retreating from 35 yuan to 32.3 yuan; the Hong Kong dollar ticket market has been slightly weaker in stability, ending at 5.12 yuan: The British and American gold pounds have gone beyond the 500 yuan mark, because the goods are scarce and expensive. Military tickets fluctuated between 7 yuan and 7.2 yuan throughout the week. Silently observing the overall trend, the footing is clearly not as strong as in the past, and the phenomenon of buying with collateral has been greatly reduced. The spot price once broke the 7 yuan mark, reaching a low of 6.95 yuan, and then went out of the mark again, which can be seen on the surface.

Family economics

### The Age of Living Within One's Means: The Problem of Household Debt

— Zeng Yuan

National budgets and household budgets are theoretically completely different. National budgets always spend according to what they bring in. If they bring in according to what they spend, public welfare is bound to be worse from one generation to the next. Like during the last global economic panic, Britain insisted on sound financial principles, blindly tightening its budget, which resulted in even greater recession. The United States and Germany went the opposite way, not thinking of tightening, but instead greatly expanding public works, and recovering prosperity from expanding deficit budgets. But a family should always strictly adhere to the principle of living within its means; if it is burdened with debt, it will never see the light of day for the rest of its life, and may even make its children unable to hold their heads up. Therefore, living within one's means is generally recognized as an iron rule of household financial management.

However, in today's world where salaries cannot keep pace with prices, this iron rule has become an unattainable ideal. Cutting expenses is a good method, but when there is nothing left to cut, you cannot help but think about living beyond your means: The heads of families today are all racking their brains like finance ministers, trying to figure out how to increase their income.

But how to "bring in"? This is the most serious question. If you don't care about tomorrow, you certainly don't need to cherish today; you might not care about petty theft. The problem is that the reason you want to get through today is so that you can have a tomorrow. Therefore, you must still proceed cautiously and not take reckless risks.

The common methods for countries to make up for deficit budgets are increasing taxes and borrowing. A family's savings are equivalent to levying taxes on the food and drink of all the family members; however, there is a limit to this. As for borrowing, if you can get a loan, it is a good method. However, there are two conditions: First, you must pay it off before the currency appreciates again, otherwise, even if you don't have an interest burden, you will actually be subjected to the most cruel heavy interest pressure. (Therefore, if you have the ability to repay debts now, you should pay off all your old debts; it is the most cost-effective). But how can you have the ability to repay debts before the currency appreciates again? Therefore, you need to fulfill another condition: you must learn from President Roosevelt or Führer Hitler's borrowing policies; that is, not only borrow to maintain your livelihood, but also further cultivate your own economic foundation (building up a business or enterprise, as well as deepening your knowledge, are different paths to the same goal of cultivating your economic foundation) and make positive, productive loans. When the Sanyou Industrial Cooperative absorbed deposits last year, it prominently displayed a notice promising repayment of principal and interest after four years, which clearly shows the benefits of active borrowing at this time. If you are already hearing "don't bother to ask" everywhere, then I only have one answer: "please find someone more capable." However, I also have a suggestion for financial institutions and even wealthy merchants. If you can release more debt claims at this time, it is a most cost-effective opportunity. You will not only help others, but also save yourself the trouble of escaping capital. As long as you specify national currency or common currency in the contract, and also appropriately extend the repayment period, the benefits will be unimaginable today.

In short: in a period of currency devaluation and rising prices: creditors benefit from long-term lending, while debtors benefit from short-term financing. If debtors borrow for active purposes, then even if they suffer a bit in the lending terms, it is still ultimately cheaper. If you borrow money and spend it recklessly, or if the plan fails, that is another matter.

### Company Introduction: The Association for Domestic Industry

— China Credit Reporting

The company's office and publishing house are located at No. 30 Henan Road, and its factory is located at No. 78, Lane 452, Xujiahui Road. It was established on July 1, 1918, and was founded by the late Mr. Chen Xuyuan (style name Diexian, alias Daxu Wosheng). It was initially set up at Mr. Chen's home on Jingxiu Road in Nanshi, and was originally a trial operation with a capital of only a few hundred yuan, specializing in the manufacture of tooth powder. After Mr. Chen's promotion, business improved daily. In 1918, it moved to Jiangyin Street, built its own factory buildings, and raised share capital, becoming a joint-stock company. Afterwards, the business became more and more developed, advancing rapidly, so it bought land next to the Local Office on Meixue Road in Nanshi and built a factory. It was completed and moved in in 1923, and later a general publishing house was established at No. 191 Nanjing Road. During the August 13th Incident, the Nanshi factory buildings were completely destroyed, resulting in significant losses. Afterwards, several commercial buildings were rented in the concession as manufacturing workshops, but the separate locations made management particularly inconvenient. In 1938, the publishing house on Nanjing Road was moved to the intersection of Hankou Road and Henan Road. The following year, a new factory was built on rented land on Xujiahui Road, but its scale was far smaller than the original factory in Nanshi. In May 1941, the shareholders decided to reorganize it into a limited company. Previously, the company's capital had reached 500,000 yuan before 1932, and increased to 600,000 yuan in 1933. At the beginning of the reorganization, the capital remained the same, and it was not until September of last year that it increased to 1.2 million yuan.

The company specializes in manufacturing and selling various cosmetics. It was invented by the founder, Chen Xuyuan, and the invincible trademark was also devised by Mr. Chen. Among them, tooth powder is the most famous, selling well in local and foreign markets. Over the years, business has developed and annual profits have been made. In 1939, business was about 1.23 million yuan, with a net profit of more than 56,000 yuan. In 1940, the turnover increased to about 2 million yuan, with a net profit of more than 82,000 yuan. In 1941, turnover almost doubled again, with a net profit of more than 150,000 yuan. Shareholders paid an official dividend of 15% in 1940 and 13.5% in 1941. The face value of the stock is 100 yuan, and the current value is about 180-190 yuan.

The current chairman of the company is Jin Zongcheng, and the directors are Chen Xiaodie, Jiang Baoli, Li Xinpu, Hu Boxiang, Lin Zhidao, Yang Sicheng, Zhou Shoujuan, and Zhang Zhenhou. The supervisors are Hu Bozhou, Jiang Pingfan, and Gu Qingyi, and the manager is Li Jiasi.

The Art of Thrift

### Calculating Materials and Techniques: Clothing Can Be Greatly Reduced

— Li Ang

Three or four years ago, a piece of woolen men's robe material cost 17 or 18 yuan, but now it costs 300 or 400 yuan; three or four years ago, a piece of Shilin cloth cheongsam material cost 1.60 or 1.70 yuan, but now you can't get it for less than 20 yuan. Food is as expensive as pearls and firewood, and dressing is like putting on gold. If you can't save any more, you have to pay attention to the use and allocation of materials. For example, when making a cheongsam with material that is more than 1.9 feet wide, I always use a one-piece cutting method. If you make a cheongsam that is 3.5 feet long, then 14 feet can be used to cut two pieces. Then cut two more feet to make trims and piping, etc. A total of 17 feet for three pieces of clothing is more than enough. If you ask a tailor to make it, each piece will take at least seven feet; calculated at five yuan a foot, it costs only 28.40 yuan to cut it yourself, and 35 yuan to have a tailor make it. Each piece of clothing is 7 or 8 yuan more expensive, and ten pieces are 70 or 80 yuan more, which is a considerable loss for half a year for the whole family. Furthermore, ironing clothes can increase their beauty, but ironing with charcoal is very expensive; and too much ironing can easily damage clothes, so it is better to use starching; over time, the savings will also be considerable. People in our Changyi area only know that silk and cotton can be reused, but actually grass cotton can also be reused. For inner wear in spring, autumn, and winter, I think flannel is the most cost-effective, because it can be recycled; if it becomes thick in one section and thin in another, it is a sign that it is about to break. However, you can transform it; just split part of the flannel into two strands per group, and embed it in the thin sections to re-knit it. Otherwise, split the old flannel into two strands per group and use it to knit socks, etc. In short: thrift is about saving money and materials, so on the one hand, you should prevent waste, and on the other hand, you should pay attention to the utilization of waste.

Talking Points

### On the Grand Ceremony of Genghis Khan

— Cheng

The grand ceremony of Genghis Khan is held every year between the 18th and 24th days of the third month of the lunar calendar. This grand ceremony is a sacred event for the Mongols. According to tradition, Mongolian princes from Inner and Outer Mongolia and the Qinghai region of Xitao should all rush to the location of Genghis Khan's mausoleum to participate in the ceremony.

Although Genghis Khan's military achievements were outstanding, he did not leave behind magnificent tombs like the pharaohs of Egypt or some Eastern monarchs for later generations to admire. Even where he was actually buried is still debated by historians. The so-called grand ceremony is not actually a ceremony at the mausoleum, but only a ceremony in front of a movable silver coffin. In the past, some people mistakenly thought that the Yijinhuoluo area in Suiyuan, where the silver coffin was previously placed, was the burial place of Genghis Khan, but this theory has now been proven incorrect. According to the research of some Mongolian scholars, Genghis Khan died on August 25, 1227, in Lingzhou, Gansu. Although that place is not far from the Hetao region of Suiyuan, his coffin was indeed transported to his birthplace at the source of the Kerulen River in Outer Mongolia for a grand funeral, and the burial site was probably near that area. Unfortunately, the Mongols at that time had a habit of hiding burial sites. After the burial, no tombs were built, and trees were planted all over the burial site and its surroundings. Soon, a dense forest was formed, so that over the years, it was no longer possible to identify the location of the tomb.

The original location of the mausoleum was Yijinhuoluo in the Yikezhao League of Suiyuan. Yikezhao and Yijinhuoluo are both Mongolian words, the former meaning "great temple" and the latter meaning "lord's camp," both named after the mausoleum. The site is located twenty miles northeast of Yingpan in the Zhasake Banner (Right Wing Front End Banner) in Dongsheng County, Suiyuan, approximately at 149 degrees 40 minutes east longitude and 39 degrees 30 minutes north latitude. The so-called mausoleum includes two large connected felt tents and some smaller felt tents. The silver coffin is stored in the large felt tent, and the other tents contain Genghis Khan's relics and the silver coffins of his several empresses. These tents are usually placed in a courtyard and guarded by the head of the Yikezhao League, who is also responsible for the sacrificial ceremonies. When the grand ceremony arrives, these tents are transported by camel cart to a slightly higher and drier area south of the site and displayed. After the ceremony, they are transported back to their original location. The silver coffin is not very large, shaped like a box, with rose flower patterns and Mongolian characters carved on it. According to Lattimore in his book Inner Mongolian Journeys, the Mongolian characters include the names of various leagues and banners in Inner and Outer Mongolia. The names Inner and Outer Mongolia and leagues and banners all originated in the Qing Dynasty, so it can be seen that these carvings are definitely not relics from the 13th century. The silver coffins of several empresses are also similar, but their decorations are slightly simpler than Genghis Khan's silver coffin. Other relics include a silver-inlaid bow and quiver, a sword, a silver saddle, etc. The authenticity of these relics is also very questionable.

Of course, this grand ceremony has a more symbolic national significance. In the official and private records of the Yuan Dynasty, there are occasional mentions of offering sacrifices at the imperial mausoleum, but they all refer to the mausoleums north of the Han River, and there is no mention of the mausoleum in the Hetao region. Moreover, the old capital of the Yuan Dynasty was in Helin, the new capital was in Beiping, the temporary capital was in Duolun, and the old camp of the birthplace was near the upper reaches of the Kerulen River. It is unlikely that Genghis Khan's mausoleum would be placed in the desolate and remote Hetao region. The important connection between the Hetao region and the Mongolian people actually occurred after the mid-Ming Dynasty. At that time, the frequent disturbances in Zigu Nei made it impossible to live in Mobei, so Dayankhan moved south to the Hetao region and took it as his base. Dayankhan was a direct descendant of Genghis Khan and had great ambitions to revive the Mongolian people. When he fled south from Mobei in a hurry, he probably used the glorious achievements of Genghis Khan and the idea of restoring the Mongolian banner's prosperity to encourage his people. Perhaps when they moved south with all their belongings, they still preserved one or two relics of Genghis Khan and the temple rituals of that year. The mausoleum of Yijinhuoluo and the annual grand ceremony probably started from that time.

The significance of holding the grand ceremony in the last ten days of the lunar month is unknown. This is not the anniversary of Genghis Khan's death; he died in the autumn. Among the Mongols, this ceremony is extremely important. According to people who have personally participated in the ceremony, the ceremony is very grand. After the war, this mausoleum is no longer located in Yijinhuoluo in Suiyuan, but has been moved from there to a certain place in the Northwest.

### Two Neutral Countries in Southwestern Europe: The Current Situation of Portugal and Spain

— Xuan

Among the European powers engaged in fierce competition, the only country that has maintained complete neutrality to this day and has been spared the ravages of war, besides Switzerland, is Portugal on the Iberian Peninsula. Although Portugal has remained aloof from the current world war, it is inevitably indirectly affected because it is not far from the battlefields of the two powers.

Bread Shortage: How Can They Be Different?

Rising prices are a common phenomenon during wartime, and it has also appeared in Portugal. In Lisbon, the capital of Portugal, there is already a phenomenon of residents lining up in front of bakeries every weekend to wait to buy bread, because transportation is difficult and imports have been drastically reduced, resulting in Lisbon's bakeries not being able to obtain sufficient flour, and the result is of course a bread shortage.

Lisbon is not only the capital of this neutral country, but also the center of activities for the exchange of personnel and information by various belligerent countries because it is located on the Atlantic coast. In addition, many wealthy people from the belligerent countries have moved to Lisbon one after another, living a leisurely life as expatriates. Therefore, the city of Lisbon has been unusually prosperous in recent years.

However, Portugal is not indifferent to the war. When the British and Dutch troops advanced into Portuguese Timor in the Pacific, the Portuguese people reacted strongly, and Portuguese Prime Minister Salazar also gave a strong speech. However, Portugal has the reputation of being "Britain's oldest ally," and for the sake of diplomatic relations or to avoid being drawn into the war itself, it is inconvenient to take decisive action and can only quietly observe the changes in the situation. Soon after, Japanese troops advanced into Portuguese Timor, and the Portuguese government still maintained a flexible attitude.

Garden White Houses: A Sanatorium

The city of Lisbon is built on the foothills on the right bank near where the Tagus River flows into the Atlantic Ocean. The flat areas are like stone steps, one on top of another, and behind them are the Sintra Mountains made of granite. The city faces the Tagus River, and looking up from the river, all you can see are white houses and many gardens. This scenery is as beautiful as looking at Naples or Istanbul from the sea. Lisbon has a mild climate, and only in summer does it occasionally get sultry. In the 18th and 19th centuries, Europeans recognized Lisbon as a sanatorium. The famous British novelist Fielding specifically went to Lisbon to recuperate. The beauty of the environment is what tourists remember most.

Spain, which occupies the vast majority of the Iberian Peninsula in Europe, is also nominally a neutral country now. The severe damage suffered during the brutal civil war a few years ago has not yet been restored, and it can only carry out reconstruction work under difficult circumstances. Franco, who rose with the help of Germany and Italy, is still the head of Spain, but there is still no sign that he will lead Spain to officially participate in the war to help the Axis powers.

Material Shortages: Promote Agricultural Production

Many of the materials Spain needs to carry out reconstruction cannot be obtained from foreign countries because the war has cut off the sources, which is its biggest difficulty. However, Spain has been using its own resources to carry out post-war construction work, and its achievements are not small. Houses are being built everywhere, public amenities are being restored, and many roads have been repaired. At the same time, it is revitalizing industry, dividing farmland, and promoting the production of rice, wheat, and corn, as well as the mining of coal and other minerals. Franco recently recited the couplet "Every family is warm, everyone is well-fed" to express his ideal.

Madrid, the capital of Spain, suffered heavy damage during the civil war and was urgently repaired after the war, but it has not yet been fully restored to its former appearance. Madrid is not as lively as Lisbon, the capital of Portugal, and there are very few foreigners. Moreover, because the terrain is very high and there is no shelter on all sides, the temperature often changes drastically, and there are records of differences of fifty degrees in one day. In summer, the hot wind with sand blows, and the heat wave in Madrid is even more annoying, often reaching 109 degrees even in the shade. In winter, there is a strong wind blowing from the north, which is extremely cold and often snows. Therefore, there is a vulgar saying in Spanish: "If the wind in Madrid does not blow out the candle, it will surely blow someone to death." This is of course an exaggeration, but it can also be known how uncomfortable the weather is there.

Strong Winds and Heat Waves: Sand Flies Around

Madrid has very few buildings of interest in architecture, and there are not many great monuments of the past, which cannot be compared with the capitals of other countries. Before the civil war, Madrid was rapidly modernizing and building high-rise buildings, and this will probably be the goal of construction work in the future. At the same time, the number of residents is also increasing. Madrid is a railway center, and train transportation has been greatly improved. The food needed in the capital is transported by train and fully supplied.

### Eyes

— Zhi Yu

Sometimes you meet a person whose eyes are one blue and the other brown; if you study it carefully, you can find that the reason why the two eyes are different colors is because of parental heredity.

Six out of ten American eyes are blue or gray, followed by brown, and then auburn. The eyes of the top Hollywood actresses are mostly blue and gray.

If your eyes are normal, they can distinguish 100 million different colors and perceive flashes of light that last a ten-millionth of a second. Your eyes are made up of 140 million nerve fibers, but only 7 million nerves can perceive color, and the rest are black and white.

Here is a little experiment to test your eyesight: on an extremely dark night, light a candle in a field, then advance sixteen miles, climb a high mountain, and look at the candlelight. If you can still see the candlelight, then your eyesight is not bad.

Imperfect eyesight often causes headaches, fatigue, neurasthenia, and changes in heart rate due to motion sickness or dim lighting.

### Automatic Information Box

— Shen Ci

The automatic information box can report to you the locations of famous theaters, parks, public institutions, hotels, dance halls, etc. in the city. For example, if you want to visit the museum, but you don’t know where it is, then just pick up the receiver of the automatic information box and move the lever to a certain line of public institutions. The machine will make a sound and tell you where the museum is. Each automatic information box can list the locations of 500 places. It is very helpful for tourists and residents.

### Chrysanthemums Bloom in Spring

— Liu Lan

Holding a chrysanthemum to appreciate it is a matter of elegance for many refined people, and autumn chrysanthemums have also ignited the imagination of many literati and poets, creating beautiful poems and articles. But one day, people will say, "It's spring, and the chrysanthemums are blooming."

It turns out that the results of the experiment conducted by Dr. Hamner of the University of Chicago have proven that a substance can promote early flowering of flowers and trees.

After two years of continuous research, it was learned that after plants are stimulated by light for a certain period of time, the hormones in their bodies become active, and the phenomenon is flowering and fruiting.

The existence of plant hormones has aroused the plans and work of horticulturalists, botanists, and chemists to study the large-scale production and manufacture of plant hormones, but it has not yet been successful.

Applying hormones can not only make chrysanthemums bloom in spring, but also promote early ripening of fruit trees. An ordinary apple tree, if allowed to grow naturally, will take ten to twelve years to bear fruit, but using hormones will only take one year to have apples to eat.

Work to improve potato production using this new method is underway, and there will be good news soon.

### Sharing the Same Boat in Storms

— He Jia Zhi

(4) In the Lingering Light

Huang Long laughed, threw Weicheng's hand away, and said as if throwing something away, "Brother Weicheng, to be honest with you, this money, this money, was not robbed, not stolen, and not cheated. It was won. Can't you believe me? Won, won gambling, won money, money won is used quickly is won quickly." Weicheng said: "Won so much?" Huang Long said: "Brother Weicheng doesn't seem to believe me. I'm leaving." He stood up, and Weicheng said: "I believe you, I believe you. I have to count how much there is." Huang Long grabbed Weicheng's hand again, which was about to count the money, and said: "Do you want to return it to me? If you want to return it, I won't lend it to you." He grabbed the few silver dollars and corner tickets and copper coins together and stuffed them into Weicheng's pocket, opened the door and left. Weicheng said: "Have dinner before you go." Huang Long said: "What a joke! This is like exchanging money for dinner, no way!"

Huang Long did not say goodbye to Mrs. Ye and Cuizhen in Shuangmei Study, who were filled with suspicion. Weicheng walked to the gate, and he had already walked out of the fence gate. Weicheng walked to the fence gate, and he had already disappeared into the twilight. Weicheng returned inside, counted the money, it was 503 yuan, and told Mrs. Ye, with a bit of sigh in doubt.
