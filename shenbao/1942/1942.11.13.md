### Pétain Fully Understands German and Italian Military Measures

Vichy, 12th (Havas dispatch) – Marshal Pétain met with Marshal von Rundstedt, Commander-in-Chief of German Forces in France, yesterday. At that time, Marshal Pétain protested the entry of German troops into free France. Paris, 12th (Havas dispatch) – Political figures here believe that General Pétain's protest against the entry of German troops into the free zone of France is only a formal gesture. Pétain fully understands the German military measures. The French government has now been allowed to exercise its political power throughout the country. Therefore, it is widely believed that the relocation of the government to Versailles or Paris will be considered from a purely military perspective.

Vichy, 12th (Havas dispatch) – Well-informed sources in Vichy state that after receiving a letter from Hitler, Marshal Pétain declared that the letter was from a friend, not an enemy. He will consider the suggestion that the French government relocate to Versailles. Marshal Pétain's opposition to the entry of German troops into the non-occupied zone of France is only diplomatic in nature and has no major significance. He is still maintaining the order to defend against Anglo-American attacks, showing that the French government supports the Axis powers' measures to defend against Anglo-American aggression.

Berlin, 12th (Allied News Agency dispatch) – The German Foreign Ministry issued a statement on the night of the 11th regarding the entry of German troops into the non-occupied zone of France, stating: (1) French Algeria is constitutionally a part of France. The situation when the German and French governments signed the armistice agreement is fundamentally different because of the American invasion. (2) The above is only related to legal aspects, but in terms of the actual military situation, the anti-Axis forces still have the ambition to occupy Corsica and French forward bases. Germany and Italy cannot stand by and watch, not only for the security of France itself, but also for European civilization. (3) If the anti-Axis forces secure bases on the mainland, it will be difficult to avoid France becoming a battlefield again. Therefore, the French people must fully understand the purpose of Chancellor Hitler's statement. (4) In summary, whether viewed from a legal, military, or strategic point of view, the situation is fundamentally different from when Germany and France signed the armistice agreement. Before the preconditions of the armistice agreement are fully resolved, the German government can only regard Marshal Pétain's note to Germany as a purely formal legal measure. (5) It must be further stated that the German troops' entry this time is by no means an attempt to occupy all of France, but to pass through the non-occupied zone to reach the trench lines along the Mediterranean coast. Chancellor Hitler, for the sake of the security of the entire European continent, made this decision after full consultation with the governments of the Axis powers. The claim that the measures were based on the Chancellor's instructions is merely propaganda by the anti-Axis countries.

### Anglo-American Displeasure

Africa Amidst the Changing Winds

### Worldwide Attention on French North Africa (4)

As luck would have it, in 1908, Morocco experienced internal strife, and the anti-foreign sentiment among the natives was raging. Indigenous people of the Zawiya tribe killed five French citizens and three Europeans in the port of Casablanca. Due to the severity of the situation, France dispatched gunboats to bombard the port and sent 3,000 troops to occupy the port and Rabat to its north. Later, a new Sultan ascended to the throne, but his rule was ineffective. Within three years, the entire country was in rebellion, and the Sultan was besieged by rebel forces. The Sultan had no choice but to request help from France. Fearing failure, France sent 10,000 troops, defeated the rebels, and took the opportunity to occupy Fez. As a result, all important towns fell into French hands.

In November 1912, France and Spain signed their final agreement. The northern part of Morocco, a zone 200 miles long and 60 miles deep, was assigned to Spain. The port of Tangier and the surrounding 40 miles were designated as a neutral international zone. The rest belonged to France. The world was divided into three, bringing temporary peace. France adopted a policy of appeasement towards Morocco, similar to that in Tunisia, to avoid excessive pressure that could incite native resistance and unnecessary bloodshed. In other words, the Sultan accepted French protection, with the French Resident-General acting as the supreme government, and French civil and military officials assisting in local administration.

However, even this policy of appeasement did not yield immediate results. Before long, Moroccan natives revolted, killing eighty French citizens in Fez, causing unrest throughout the territory. The situation in the Spanish-controlled area was even worse, with Spanish troops being defeated by native forces. A native leader named Krim, known for his intelligence and bravery, called on the natives in the mountain region to attack foreigners and implement his "Morocco for Moroccans" policy. By 1925, his influence was at its peak, and he attempted to invade the French-occupied areas. France was terrified and had to join forces with Spain to deal with him. France even sent Marshal Pétain, the current head of state, to oversee the war. The war was unprecedented in its intensity, but unfortunately, France did not have a great writer like Rudyard Kipling to write about the colonial war in a way that was both moving and tragic. By the end of that year, the French colonial army had suffered over 11,000 casualties. In 1926, Krim was finally captured and sent to Réunion Island, and the national borders were largely pacified.

Morocco is a modern, classical, and barbaric country all at once. Airplanes and camel caravans exist side by side within its borders, and have done so for quite some time. They have been immersed in a thousand years of Eastern culture, while also embracing various Western peoples and cultures. The total area of the country is 431,000 square kilometers, with a population of about six million. Important cities and ports include the capital Rabat, Fez, Marrakesh, Casablanca, Meknes, Mogador, Agadir, and others. The country is rich in forests, oak trees, and livestock. The highlands are home to ancient cypress trees, with trunks towering into the sky, some reaching the height of a fourteen-story building. Some of these trees are four hundred years old. The French authorities are working hard to protect the forests, but the natives indiscriminately cut them down. Their logging method is very peculiar, using neither axes nor saws, but simply setting fire to the trunk, burning it through, and letting the tree fall on its own.

Although the political center of Morocco is in Rabat, where the French Resident-General resides, Muslim native chiefs prefer to live in Marrakesh. The city's buildings are all painted red, earning it the name "Red City." The city boasts nine hundred palm trees, with red and green intertwined, creating a beautiful sight. Throughout the cities, Muslim mosques stand tall, and the natives are devout in their Islamic faith, praying, "There is only one God, and Muhammad is His prophet." In Rabat, when the Sultan prays on Fridays, there is a grand procession, with people cheering along the way, a truly magnificent sight.

The interior of Morocco is home to many large and small chiefs, each living in fortresses or camps, forming their own little worlds. Larger chiefs often have many wives and concubines, as well as numerous servants, and own tens of thousands of horses, cattle, and sheep. The natives live separately in their respective territories, with Berbers predominating in the mountains and Arabs and Moors predominating in the plains. Moroccans are known for their strength, love of fighting, and fearlessness of death. They often rebel against their chiefs and Sultans, let alone foreigners. Therefore, even today, lone foreigners dare not venture deep into the interior. However, Moroccans who enlist in the French colonial army are renowned for their bravery and skill in battle.

Berber men are all thin and wiry, but their movements are exceptionally agile. The women reveal their beautiful dark eyes, full of passionate charm. They are more open-minded than their Muslim sisters elsewhere, not wearing veils and managing household affairs, being true virtuous wives and good mothers, and also possessing considerable property rights. If it weren't for the harsh African sun, their skin would be very fair, as they are of partly Caucasian descent.

The international commercial port of Morocco shares similarities with the cosmopolitan city of Shanghai. In the marketplaces of Moroccan cities, one can find scenes reminiscent of the Shanghai City God Temple or the Great World amusement center. During the day, there are all sorts of lively entertainment venues. Snake charmers, dancers, magicians, opera singers, storytellers – you name it, they have it. They don't sell tickets, relying entirely on voluntary contributions. Spectators, regardless of gender, status, or age, enjoy the performances on an equal footing, making it a truly typical entertainment venue for the masses. However, this kind of limited outlook and peaceful situation cannot be maintained anymore. Allied forces have already landed on the coast of Morocco. If Morocco falls, not only will French North Africa be unreliable, but even Dakar in West Africa will be in imminent danger.

### Sugar Merchants' Cooperative Business Office - Specific Plan for Sugar Distribution Based on Population - One Pound per Household Head and Half a Pound per Person per Month Planned for Implementation Next Month - Temporary Retail Sales Starting Today Based on House Tax Receipts or Citizen ID

The Shanghai Sugar Merchants' Cooperative Business Office, in view of the fact that after the implementation of the method of purchasing sugar with citizen ID cards, congestion in purchasing sugar still exists, and there are even situations of speculative buying and profiteering, which is contrary to the original intention of maintaining people's livelihood and popularizing sugar purchase, has now revised the method of issuing sugar and formulated "Temporary Measures for Temporary Door-to-Door Sugar Sales," which will be implemented from today. It is stipulated that purchase should be based on house tax receipts, limited to one purchase per month, with a limit of 5 to 25 yuan in Central Reserve Notes. If it is not enough, one can purchase one yuan per person each time with a citizen ID. At the same time, a new system of sugar distribution based on population is being planned, and specific measures are being studied. According to reliable news obtained by our reporter from the office yesterday, the new system of sugar distribution based on population will be implemented from December 1 after the research is completed and approved by the authorities. It is heard that it will be stipulated that each household head will be given one catty of sugar per month, and each person will be given half a catty of sugar per month, extrapolated based on the population. The method of issuing sugar purchase certificates will be cooperated with the concession authorities, modeled after the method of grain distribution based on population. After the implementation of sugar distribution based on population, the temporary door-to-door sugar sales measures will be cancelled.

Limited to 25 Yuan per Household

The Shanghai Sugar Merchants' Cooperative Business Office has temporarily revised the temporary measures for door-to-door sugar sales. (1) Retailers selling sugar door-to-door are divided into two types. The first type is designated stores selling sugar with house tax receipts. Households can purchase from these stores with their house tax receipts, limited to 5 to 25 yuan in Central Reserve Notes, with red and white sugar sold together (still according to the previous method, one small package every five yuan, calculated according to the official sugar price, including 2% retail tax). Limited to once per month, and no further purchase is allowed from any store. After purchasing, each household should distribute the sugar evenly among the entire family. If it is not enough, it can be purchased from the second type of retail store. The second type is designated stores selling sugar with citizen ID cards. Households can purchase from these stores with their citizen ID cards, limited to one yuan per person each time. (2) The house tax receipts held by households are stipulated as follows:

A. Residents of the International Settlement, Hongkou, the Southern City of Shanghai, Zhabei, and the northwest of Pudong should all use this year's autumn house tax receipts.

B. Residents of the French Concession must use the September-October house tax receipts.

C. The above house tax receipts are universally applicable for purchase from designated retail stores within the distribution range of this office, but monthly and quarterly receipts cannot be used interchangeably.

D. When purchasing, the supervising staff will stamp the back blank corner of the tax receipt with the words "Sugar Paid," indicating the limit.

Business Needs - Apply According to Law

(3) Stores designated to sell sugar with house tax receipts shall no longer sell with citizen ID cards, and stores designated to sell sugar with citizen ID cards shall no longer sell with house tax receipts. (4) All stores selling sugar with house tax receipts or citizen ID cards will have the designation of this office posted at the door for easy identification. (5) The amount of sugar sold by each retail store each day will still be in accordance with the regulations of this office, based on one-thirtieth of the October allocation and the sugar previously stored, until the quota is full. If less than one-thirtieth is sold, it will be included in the sales for the next day, and so on. (6) Restaurants,菜館 and other food stores that need sugar for business purposes, and whose purchases according to the above methods are insufficient, may apply to this office through their respective trade associations. After review and approval, a purchase certificate will be issued to purchase from designated retail stores. (Five yuan, measured by balance, including tax) One catty and two taels of white sugar, one catty and three taels of red and green sugar, fifteen taels and two qian of rock sugar.

(One yuan, measured by balance) Three taels and seven qian of white sugar, three taels and nine qian of red and green sugar, three taels and one qian of rock sugar.

Sugar Stores Divided into Two Categories

There are 96 Class A retail stores with a monthly allocation of more than 30 packages. From today, they will all post a white sign with red characters "Shanghai Sugar Merchants' Cooperative Business Office Designated Retailer for Sugar Sales with House Tax Receipts." There are more than 300 small retail stores with a monthly allocation of less than 30 packages. From today, they will all post a white sign with red characters "Shanghai Sugar Merchants' Cooperative Business Office Designated Retailer for Sugar Sales with Citizen ID Cards Limited to One Yuan in Central Reserve Notes." At the same time, the cooperative office will send supervising staff to be stationed or rotate to supervise the distribution. The total amount of sugar allocated for this month has been determined to be 25,000 packages, with 70% allocated to households in front of Class A retail stores and 30% allocated to restaurants and other food stores for business needs. The office has already moved the sugar to be allocated to the office warehouse, and it will be issued to Class A and B merchants in about 20 days.

### Maintaining Autumn Beauty in the Face of Cold Weather

— Zhou

Taking advantage of the anniversary of the Premier's birth, I stole half a day to go to Huang Garden to appreciate chrysanthemums, inevitably giving the impression of a vulgar person pretending to be refined.

Walking through winding paths, I unexpectedly found a secluded place. Arriving at Huang Garden, thousands of loads of worldly dust were naturally washed away. The owner, Mr. Huang Yuezhou, personally managed the flowers, and his high spirits were as before. Gazing at the rocky mountain and admiring the autumn chrysanthemums, I suddenly recalled Guan Xiu's poem, "The lotus is so deep that it seems like entering the Shaoxi Road, the strange rocks make me suspect that I am walking in the Yandang Mountains. I am only afraid that the Central Plains is in turmoil, and Heaven's will does not allow the host to be idle." It seems very fitting to give to the host as well. I am merely looking at the chrysanthemums with the sympathy that they brave the severe frost and their firm integrity is commendable. Of course, I do not understand the varieties. I do not know the preciousness of Phoenix Claws and Starry Sky. I only see the yellow flowers floating gracefully, unlike ordinary ones, which I consider to be a resonance with Zhou Lianxi's "Chrysanthemum is the recluse of flowers" in On the Love of Lotus.

In Li Qingzhao's Drunken Flowers, "Do not say that it does not break the heart, the curtain is rolled up by the west wind, and the person is thinner than the yellow flower." In recent years, I have been rushing about in life, and many good friends are halfway across the world. I am feeling sad and heartbroken, only parting! In addition, in the reporter's career for more than ten years, working day and night, the person is thinner than the yellow flower, which is quite accurate. Walking in this flower country, I naturally cannot help but feel "the rich and powerful do not die of hunger, but scholars are misled in life."

At the host's home, we talked for two hours, knowing that he would lose nearly 50,000 yuan this year for his chrysanthemum addiction, but he does not hesitate at all. His noble and firm integrity makes me sure that only this host is worthy of loving chrysanthemums. Those mediocre and vulgar people are not worthy of appreciating chrysanthemums, let alone cultivating them. Many people of fame and fortune are truly ashamed in front of chrysanthemums.

The host showed a poem presented by the eighty-six-year-old Yongsou Mr. Chen Kuilong, which contains the sentence "Maintaining autumn beauty in the face of cold weather." I quite like to recite it. My companion, Brother He, saw a white crane raised in Huang Garden, and was quietly moved by the scene, quite envious of the crane's ability to capture pure interest. The host then led the crane to dance, with orderly advances and retreats, ethereal and immortal. Returning in the evening, I have never held a crab, so I can only drink wine and recall chrysanthemums. Since I do not have Wang Ji's heroic spirit of "Seeing people all drunk, how can I bear to be awake alone" when passing by a wine shop, I will pick up my bald pen and consider it as a parting feeling from the chrysanthemum garden.

### East Asia Economic Roundtable: Welcoming Advisor Ishiwata

Mr. Sotaro Ishiwata, President of the East Asia Economic Roundtable and recently appointed Supreme Economic Advisor, arrived in Shanghai from Beijing on the 9th. To express their welcome, the Central China Headquarters of the Roundtable held a grand tea party at the International Hotel on the afternoon of the 11th (previous day). Mr. Chen Shaowei, Director of the Central China Headquarters, and Mr. Chen Riping, Managing Director, personally hosted the event, and invited leaders of various Chinese and Japanese institutions in Shanghai, as well as leaders from the financial, industrial, and commercial sectors, totaling over 200 attendees. After taking their seats, Mr. Chen Shaowei, Director of the Central China Headquarters, delivered a welcoming speech, followed by a reply from Mr. Ishiwata, who expressed his intention to assist in the construction of the Greater East Asia economy with great sincerity. The gathering concluded joyfully at around 5 o'clock.

### Wang Tongshu Painting Exhibition

Fundraising for the Infant Asylum

Miss Wang Tongshu, who came from Beiping (Beijing), is skilled in poetry and prose, and proficient in playing the guqin (zither). In her spare time, she also studies traditional Chinese painting, which she has diligently pursued for over a decade. Her brushwork has a unique quality and does not follow the beaten path of previous artists. She is especially adept at integrating poetic sentiment into her paintings. Viewing Miss Wang's works evokes a sense of holding Tao Yuanming's poems. Her profound artistic accomplishment is beyond that of ordinary individuals. To raise funds for the Shanghai Infant Education and Care Institute, she is holding a solo exhibition of over 200 meticulously created paintings from recent years at the Daxon Department Store Art Gallery on the 16th of this month. It is believed that those who are enthusiastic about education and fond of calligraphy and painting will consider this event a matter of utmost importance. Her virtuous act is worthy of praise from the public, and a grand occasion is anticipated at the time.

Spring and Autumn

### Talking About Cats

– Shi Ting

Many people like to compare humans with animals. As a result, exclamations such as "Humans are inferior to dogs" and "Humans are inferior to cats" arise. In fact, this comparison and this exclamation are largely unnecessary.

For example, Mr. Xu Xizhen, feeling inconvenienced by walking in the dark and bumping into telephone poles, hopes that he could be a cat at such times. However, when we think about it carefully, it seems that having a pair of cat's eyes is naturally fine, but completely becoming a cat is really undesirable.

Because, in a certain sense, people's unaccustomed to darkness is indeed a weakness. However, precisely because people are not accustomed to darkness, they yearn for light. If everyone were accustomed to darkness, who would fight against darkness and strive for light?

Yes, darkness often obscures the earth. We need a pair of sharp eyes like a cat's to be able to see clearly the things around us in the dark. Otherwise, we will inevitably step into puddles of sewage, fall into traps, be unable to defend against the wolf packs attacking from the dark, and even less be able to fight with them. However, we cannot become a cat, because cats like darkness; they need darkness to conceal themselves, wait for opportunities, and hunt for food. If we become a cat in the dark, it is tantamount to willingly being conquered by darkness.

Therefore, we need the eyes of a cat, but we must not become a cat in the dark.

### Continuing to Eat is Difficult

— Zhi Hu

Because I had something important to do, though the distance was short, I hailed a rickshaw as soon as I stepped out the door.

"Two oceans" - the rickshaw puller's bargaining was very straightforward. I looked and saw that there was only this one rickshaw at the door. This is called "scarcity makes it precious". Rickshaw pullers understand this trick best.

I bargained down to one yuan, which I considered polite, as it was at most only two or three blocks. However, the rickshaw puller's reply was truly infuriating. He said, "Sir, you should walk instead!" This is equivalent to the fishmonger's "If you can't afford fish, why ask the price?"

I could only use my two legs and start striding. But the rickshaw puller suddenly caught up and said, "Come, come, it's a hard business!"

After getting on the rickshaw, I said to him: You should be more polite when doing business. You can choose not to pull if the money is too little.

The rickshaw puller knew how to put on an act. He first sighed, then said: We rely on pulling for our livelihood. Today, you are the first customer, sir. Please don't be angry that I said something offensive.

I remained silent.

### Tricycles

— Wen Chao

Recently, the tricycle business in Shanghai seems to be very developed. The former car dealerships have undergone several changes and are now tricycle companies.

Currently, it can be said that it is the era of tricycles. The people of Shanghai are truly blessed with feet.

Since cars "retired" (not obsolete), and tram fares have increased several times, bicycles, carriages, rickshaws... compete with each other, all wanting to win the leader in the transportation business.

Bicycles were popular for a while, but the trend of stealing bicycles also rose, making people quite worried about the troubles of this "mount." Carriages are obsolete. Anything eliminated by the times can never expect to make a comeback. Although they were active for a while, they were always difficult to stand out. Because the cost of raising a horse to pull a carriage is not as cost-effective as hiring a rickshaw puller to pull a rickshaw. (In the competition between horses and humans, horses are bound to fail because the value of a horse is higher than that of a human.) Rickshaws can only maintain their original position.

Tricycles are welcomed by people, of course, because they have many advantages. It is a product of "modernity" and "urbanity".

In fact, the biggest advantage of tricycles is that two people can "share the ride." For couples, it is an opportunity; for husbands and wives, it is a habit; for friends, they can "chat side by side." As for old ladies, they can also bring a few more grandchildren out for a stroll.

Therefore, the reason why tricycles can be popular is not because of the addition of a wheel, but because of the addition of a seat.

### Sharing the Same Boat Through Storms

— He Jia Zhi

(11) The Enemy

Huang Long asked: "Going out for a trip, where to?" Wei Cheng said: "Where to go, I haven't decided yet, but I'm going out with you anyway. You need to know, why go out during the Lunar New Year? Because if we go out during the Lunar New Year, my aunt won't suspect we're doing anything earth-shattering. I also anticipate that if I ask my aunt for a hundred or two hundred dollars to gamble or spend, she'll think that it's only a few major holidays in a year, and she'll generously agree. We take the money..." Huang Long said: "With money, we don't need anything else. I have a knife. With a knife, we don't need a gun. If we carry a gun, we'll be charged if it's found. A knife is not like a gun. Even if it's found, the knife is confiscated, then I still have two fists. Fists can also take lives, just like in the case of Wei Shaoyun!" Wei Cheng was startled, hurriedly shook his head, looked up at the rafters, and then stared at the small holes in the clam shell window, saying "You can't name names." Huang Long smiled and said: "Sorry, I forgot again. My words are the truth. Now it's your turn to speak, where do you say we're going with the money?" Wei Cheng said: "I'm planning to go to at least three places. This Cheng Bing, he's originally from Ant Mound Town, so first we should go to Ant Mound Town. When we get to the town, we first find out where this Cheng Bing went, whether he changed his surname to Chen. If this Cheng Bing has moved, or someone knows that he changed his surname to Chen, then it's almost certain. We quickly go to Shuangqiao Town to find Old Lady Chen. Old Lady Chen is the grandmother of Chen Guoqi and Chen Guofang. Their ancestral home is now in Shuangqiao Town. I and Ah Xing have both been there. As long as we go to Old Lady Chen's place, we'll ask him with lightning speed. If we find out, then it's almost certain. We quickly go to Shanghai to find the Chen siblings. With a brother, there is a sister, and with a sister, there is a brother. With these siblings, there is their father. At that time, we won't care about anything else. We'll just recognize him as the enemy, and we won't ask what his status is, what kind of power he has. White knives go in, red knives come out, that's what I've decided." As Wei Cheng spoke, he gritted his teeth and punched the table with his fist. The water in the water bowl on the table splashed out, showing that Wei Cheng was extremely sad and indignant. (228)
