### Travel Notes on the Indian Peninsula (4)

When the train stopped at a station in the early morning, men and women went to the water pipes near the platform to bathe. Once, we saw a man bathing completely through the train window. He first stretched out one arm and washed it completely, then washed his thigh. In this way, he scrubbed completely and washed his whole body with only a small basin of water!

Ever-changing pictures flashed before our eyes: ragged people huddled up asleep, waiting for tomorrow morning's train; coolies with red cloths wrapped around their heads squatted on a line, ready to carry eighty pounds of assorted luggage for a mere anna (two cents); you had to wait until the train stopped to scramble onto another dining car, gulp down your coffee, and rush back to your own compartment; the first-class carriages were particularly comfortable, with private showers and lots of fans; bedding was not provided on the train, so you had to bring your own; dust got everywhere...

We arrived in Baroda feeling very cramped. After setting up the mirrors, boxes, and lights in the grand hall, the ceremony was about to begin.

The monarch sat on a golden throne, wearing a crown with jeweled ornaments, receiving the people's congratulations. Behind him stood two very imposing guards, holding golden maces. The Crown Prince stood on his right, wearing a headband adorned with jade. The Baroda Prince's decorations included dazzling jewels, a jade brooch, and a feather plume on his headdress.

The ceremony lasted an hour, and one part involved the people offering grain to the monarch, who returned a small portion to the giver. Singers and dancers entertained the guests in a corner of the hall.

Kites and Baseballs

In the afternoon, the monarch and his eldest son accompanied us for a walk in the large garden behind the hall. It was half a mile to move the photography equipment from the audience hall to the garden. The young Crown Prince discussed the games of polo and kites with us, and from the conversation, we knew that he also enjoyed baseball.

We saw several national treasures, including a solid gold cannon weighing 280 pounds (worth $117,600) and a beautiful silver and gold carriage. They were displayed during important ceremonies, and the former was pulled by two milk-white oxen.

We wanted to go to the neighboring desert city of Bikaner for two reasons. First, the Prince of Bikaner's grandson, Ghani, was marrying a princess from Dunkirk, and we wanted to photograph the engagement ceremony. In our Western eyes, this kind of ceremony is rare. But more importantly, we could attend another wedding ceremony: the Prince of Bikaner's granddaughter was marrying the Crown Prince of Jodhpur, a city with very ancient foundations, dating back to before the time of Christ. This wedding had been planned for a year, and the date was about six weeks after Ghani's engagement ceremony, making it one of the grandest ceremonies in India in recent years.

The next morning, we left Baroda and crossed the desert to Bikaner. After the train had passed two stations, there was a knock on the carriage door, followed by a neatly dressed waiter.

"His Highness has sent breakfast," he said. "What would you like?"

Everything was at our disposal! Paget (i.e., the author Mrs. Dyott) was always like a hungry wolf, wanting oatmeal porridge, toast, and coffee. Lorne was still sleepy and lazily agreed. Thus, a delicious breakfast was cooked and sent to us.

When the train arrived at the next station, the waiter came again. What else did we want to eat? We decided on ham and eggs. This time, because the food had to be cooked at the station, the train stopped for a while.

When we arrived at Bikaner station, the Prince's British-Indian representatives welcomed us at the station, and we were escorted by a guard to the reception hall.

Passing through the city streets lined with troops, we encountered many interesting processions. First, there was a camel-riding drummer, followed by two horse-riding drummers, a military band, and a company of infantry. A magnificent, fully equipped elephant led the way, with many people carrying the betrothal gifts on covered silver platters, followed by many carriages carrying distinguished guests. They were on their way to the palace to attend the engagement ceremony.

### Gandhi Invited to New Delhi; Meets Cripps Today; Consultations on Indian Affairs Enter New Stage; Kuomintang Standing Committee Meeting Scheduled for the Day After Tomorrow

New Delhi, 26th (Reuters Telegram) – Cripps recently disclosed that he had telegraphed Gandhi two or three days ago, stating that he would be happy to have the opportunity to talk with him. He subsequently received a reply from Gandhi, stating, "Thank you for your telegram. The Standing Committee of the Indian National Congress has decided that only the President and Nehru should meet with you. You also know that I oppose all wars, but if you wish to meet with me, I would be happy to see you. I can depart on Thursday morning." Cripps replied, "I am very eager to meet you." He expects to meet with Gandhi tomorrow.

New Delhi, 26th (Reuters Telegram) – After meeting with Sir Stafford Cripps, the British envoy to India, yesterday, the President of the Indian National Congress, Azad, looked somber and dazed. He immediately convened a meeting of the party's Standing Committee on the 29th to discuss Cripps' plan. Azad also consulted with various important figures in the party and Gandhi's son, Devdas. When asked if Azad intended to continue talks with Cripps, Azad remained silent. Three minutes after Azad's departure, Cripps welcomed the leader of the Muslim League, Jinnah, into his residence for a 75-minute meeting. Jinnah left with documents in hand, looking very happy, in stark contrast to Azad. According to Jinnah, the suggestions received will be submitted to the Muslim League Action Committee for discussion tomorrow. The leader of the Hindu Mahasabha, Savarkar, is scheduled to meet with Cripps on the 28th. Cripps originally met with military and political authorities at the Governor-General's residence, but only moved to his residence yesterday to meet with representatives of various parties. The consultations on the Indian issue have thus entered a new stage.

New Delhi, 26th (Reuters Telegram) – Cripps today met with the Maharajah of Nawanagar (President of the Chamber of Princes) and the Maharajah of Bikaner (Acting President of the Chamber of Princes). He will also meet with Labour Party members of the Indian Central Legislative Assembly. Cripps has also met with Sir Conrad Corfield, Political Advisor to the Viceroy of India.

New Delhi, 26th (Reuters Telegram) – Cripps told reporters this morning that he was asked when he could make a statement on the proposals he brought. He could not say with absolute certainty, but he intends to provide some interesting news on Saturday. His spirits were no lower last night than at breakfast.

Saigon, 26th (Huitong News Agency Telegram) – According to news received here last night, Gandhi has not yet learned the content of Cripps' proposals for India. When asked whether Gandhi would go to New Delhi to attend the meeting of the Congress Party's Executive Committee, he replied that he would not answer this question until he had heard the report from the Speaker of the All-India Congress Committee after his meeting with Cripps.

Lisbon, 26th (Huitong News Agency Telegram) – According to news from Washington, Grenelle, former US Undersecretary of State, has been appointed as the head of the US advisory delegation to India. Colonel Johnson will serve as President Roosevelt's personal representative in India. Johnson will also remain in India during Cripps' stay.

### Soviet Ambassador Delivers Speech in Britain; Advocates Immediate Offensive

London, 25th (Havas News Agency Telegram) – Soviet Ambassador to Britain Maisky recently delivered a speech here, stating that the Allied powers should make their greatest effort at this time and not wait until 1943. If the Allied forces want to win, they must take the offensive immediately. The way to attack is to attack the German army from the Soviet front. All efforts must be concentrated to achieve a decisive victory. As for how to attack, this question should be answered by the General Staff. However, one point should be clear: the attack must be launched in 1942, not 1943. This is the only way to win. The enemy army is making its greatest effort this spring, and we should also make the same effort to cope with it.

Stockholm, Sweden, 26th (Huitong News Agency Telegram) – The London Times published an article today supporting Soviet Ambassador to Britain Maisky's demand, advocating that for the sake of British honor, British industry and diplomacy must fulfill their moral and material obligations.

### Hungary and Romania: Border Tranquility; Hungary Remains Silent on Disputes

Bucharest, Romania, 25th (Havas News Agency Dispatch): Rumors circulating about serious incidents occurring on the border between Hungarian and Romanian troops have been denied by military circles here. It is reported that the border between Hungary and Romania, as well as all regions of Romania, are as tranquil as usual.

Bucharest, Romania, 25th (Havas News Agency Dispatch): Prime Minister General Ion Antonescu signed an order today implementing mandatory military service. The order stipulates that all young men in the country must enlist and serve for two years. Upon completion of their service, they will be transferred to the reserves, but may be mobilized at any time before the age of fifty.

Budapest, Hungary, 25th (Havas News Agency Dispatch): The Hungarian News Agency recently announced that, following the speech by Romanian Deputy Prime Minister Mihai Antonescu regarding the issue of Outer Transylvania, the country's newspapers have also launched an anti-Hungarian propaganda campaign. The dispute between Romania and Hungary has thus attracted worldwide attention. However, Hungary remains silent, as its foreign policy is not focused on dramatic performances but on practical results. According to a spokesman for the Hungarian Foreign Ministry, Hungary opposes mutual attacks among European countries, considering it a violation of European conduct. Therefore, the Romanian-Hungarian issue is only seeing unilateral action from the Romanian government and its newspapers, while the Hungarian government and newspapers have consistently remained silent.

### US President and Iranian Shah Exchange Telegrams

Washington, 25th: It is understood from the content of the telegrams exchanged between the U.S. President and the Shah of Iran that the provisions of the Atlantic Charter are also extended to Iran. The Shah of Iran telegraphed that Iran has allied with Britain and the Soviet Union, and stated, "Iran has always expressed confidence in the friendship between the U.S. and Iran, and deeply believes that Your Excellency's consistent adherence to fundamental principles will ensure that the promised commitments are implemented, enabling the nation and its people to develop peacefully and build a bright future." The U.S. President replied by telegram, saying that he was "particularly pleased" that the Iranian-British-Soviet alliance stipulates that Britain and the Soviet Union are resolved to respect Iran's territorial integrity, sovereignty, and political independence. He further expressed his satisfaction that Iran is willing to cooperate with the Allied nations.

London, 25th (Havas News Agency Dispatch): Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Mr. Law, stated in a speech in the House of Commons today, "I have every reason to believe that the new Iranian government will continue to cooperate with its predecessor and will fulfill the alliance previously signed between Britain, the Soviet Union, and Iran."

### Hitler Meets with Boris in His Headquarters; Rumors Suggest Bulgaria Will Participate in the Eastern Front War; Turkish Political Circles Monitor European Developments

Berlin, 26th (Haitong News Agency Dispatch): The German Führer's headquarters announced last night that Führer Hitler met with King Boris of Bulgaria at his headquarters on March 24th. The talks were lengthy and conducted in a very cordial atmosphere. That evening, the King attended a banquet hosted by German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop. The following day, the King visited General Göring at Carinhall.

Istanbul, Turkey, 25th (Havas News Agency Dispatch): Political circles here are closely monitoring the development of the European situation, especially the visit of King Boris of Bulgaria to Berlin, while maintaining a calm attitude. It is believed that the Bulgarian government will soon sever ties with the Soviet Union, and its troops will participate in the Eastern Front war. However, such a development is not necessarily beneficial to Turkey, as the threat to Turkey's western border may thereby be alleviated. Furthermore, the war psychology induced by the propaganda personnel of various countries here can also be reduced. Recently, Britain, the Soviet Union, and Bulgaria have all been creating suspicion in Turkey, seeking to give Turkey the impression that war is imminent. For example, Bulgarian propaganda claims that the country must guard its Thracian border and cannot send troops to the Soviet front lines. The Soviet Union, on the other hand, asserts that Bulgaria may attack Turkey, forcing Turkey and Bulgaria to station large numbers of troops on their borders, so that Bulgaria will have no surplus strength to send troops to fight against the Soviet Union. In Bulgaria's view, it will be very difficult to avoid participating in the Eastern Front war from now on. If it does not participate, the country will lose the territories it gained in 1939. In this regard, the country is in a similar position to Hungary. As for the return of German Ambassador to Turkey, Franz von Papen, to Germany and the return of Turkish Ambassador to Germany, Celal Muhtar, to Turkey, it is at least related to the situation in Bulgaria. After the German and Turkish envoys returned to their respective countries to report, Germany may have assured Bulgaria that Turkey has no intention of invading Bulgaria. In short, Turkey's attitude can be summarized in one sentence: avoid getting caught up in the vortex of war at any cost, because Turkey's participation in the war would be more harmful than beneficial.

Turkey and Bulgaria to Hold Important Talks

Istanbul, 25th (Havas News Agency Dispatch): Well-informed sources have announced that Turkish Minister to Italy, Teko, will soon return home to report on his duties. This coincides with the return of the Turkish Ambassador to Germany. Political circles therefore believe that the Turkish government intends to hold important talks on its relations with Europe this spring on the eve of a major event. At the same time, the former Turkish Ambassador to Britain, Rüştü Aras, has also returned here to report to the government on the current situation in Britain. It is rumored that President İsmet İnönü may meet with an important Bulgarian figure within days, as evidenced by President İnönü's continued stay here and the suggestion that he may visit Edirne in the north next month. The geographical location of this city leads observers to believe that Turkey and Bulgaria will hold talks there. However, well-informed political sources have said that the President's trip is only to inspect troops.

Ankara, 26th (Haitong News Agency Dispatch): The Turkish-Bulgarian trade negotiations currently underway in Ankara are progressing smoothly, and a trade agreement is expected to be concluded soon. The Bulgarian representative has prepared to sign the draft agreement and is awaiting instructions from his superiors to decide whether or not to sign the agreement.

The Soviet army reorganized its remnants in an attempt to attack again, but was also defeated by German artillery fire. In the afternoon of the same day, the Soviet offensive was repulsed again, and ten tanks were destroyed.

### Prominent Figures and Elders of This City Held a Public Memorial Service for Han Guojun Yesterday; Over a Hundred Elders Attended in Full Formal Attire; A Village Posthumous Title Ceremony Was Held, Bestowing Han Qin Ke Gong

After the death of Han Zishi (Guojun) of Hai'an, the prominent figures and elders who knew him during his lifetime in Shanghai held a public memorial service at Jing'an Temple yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM and publicly bestowed a village posthumous title. The details of the event are recorded as follows:

Participating Elders

The public memorial service yesterday was held in the back hall of Jing'an Temple. Over a hundred elders attended, including Chen Taoyi, Jiang Weiqiao, Jia Shiyi, Shen Enfu, Wu Zhaoyuan, Ji Longtu, Zhang Yipeng, Jin Dingdong, Song Dexuan, Li Yizun, Chen Yunzhong, Shi Shengyuan, Yu Haicen, Tao Fuqing, Ding Fubao, Yu Chengxiu, Feng Qie, Liu Zhenqiu, Hu Jun, etc.

Details of the Public Memorial Service

The public memorial service began at 2:00 PM. Wu Zhaoyuan was appointed as the chief officiant, with Ji Longtu, Shen Enfu, Chen Taoyi, Zhang Yipeng, and Jin Dingxun as accompanying officiants, and Liu Zhenqiu as the master of ceremonies. After the chief officiant, accompanying officiants, and participants took their places, incense and wreaths were offered, followed by libations and silk offerings, and the presentation of dishes. Jin Dingdong then read the eulogy. After reading, everyone bowed once. Next, the chief officiant and accompanying officiants presented congratulatory silk, which was burned at the incineration site. After returning to their places, Miss Liu, the second daughter of the Han family, delivered a speech on behalf of the family, and the memorial ceremony was completed.

Holding the Village Posthumous Title Ceremony

After the public memorial service, the ceremony of respectfully bestowing the village posthumous title was held. Jiang Zhuzhuang was appointed as the chairman. Pang Diancai reported on Han's life, such as his efforts in water conservancy, maintaining sovereignty, and his dedication to social causes in his later years, as well as his steadfast integrity. His words were very concise and essential. Next, the chairman respectfully read the village posthumous title document (recorded separately), requesting the posthumous title of "Qin Ke" (Diligent and Respectful), which was unanimously approved. At this point, everyone performed the ceremony again. Finally, Ms. Liu Xian delivered a thank-you speech on behalf of the family, and the event concluded.

The Posthumous Title is Qin Ke (Diligent and Respectful)

The village posthumous title document is recorded below: "Zhou's [posthumous title] method is to dissolve the law, just like Duke Zhou and Grand Duke Wang, who opened the way for the king's cause and built meritorious deeds in the Muye fields, finally buried [after death]. Hence, the posthumous title method was created. A posthumous title is a trace of one's actions, accumulated over a lifetime and then bestowed as a posthumous title. It is for encouraging good deeds and showcasing virtuous deeds. This began in Zhou, and subsequent dynasties after Han continued to follow it until the Qing dynasty without interruption. After Mr. Han Zishi returned to the Dao Mountain, his colleagues privately bestowed a posthumous title. We respectfully follow the saying in the Book of Rites that 'the livelihood of the people lies in action,' and the Book of Songs says, 'performing duties with respect.' Mr. Han is undoubtedly worthy of this. Therefore, the posthumous title is 'Qin Ke' (Diligent and Respectful) to show it to future generations. Do not forget his great virtue. Jiang Weiqiao respectfully recognizes, Chen Taoyi respectfully writes."

Collecting Posthumous Manuscripts

Han's disciple, Pang Diancai, issued a call for the collection of Han's posthumous poems and essays. The announcement reads: "Our late teacher, Han Guojun, passed away last winter. His morality and writings were praised by his contemporaries. However, most of his lifelong works were destroyed in the recent war. Only two books, his self-edited chronicle and Yong Yi Lu, remain. These have already been sent for printing. If friends have any of Teacher Zi Shi's poems and essays, please copy and send them to my residence at 302 Huanlong Road so that they can be compiled and published. As for the chronicle and Yong Yi Lu, due to limited funds, only a small number will be printed. If you wish to order additional copies, the cost of materials for each copy is five yuan. Please submit your order to the Jin Cheng Bank at the intersection of Jing'an Temple Road and Carter Road before April 10th to receive a receipt. You can pick up the book at the Bai Song Printing House at 689 Zhejiang Road two months later."

Contents of the Statement

The Chief of the Press Section of the Army and Navy stated: "After the Japanese Army and Navy in Shanghai entered the Concession on December 8th of last year, the acquisition, loss, change, or transfer of rights to movable and immovable property within the Concession was prohibited. Hostile factories and educational institutions were sealed off. This was solely to eliminate and remove the influence of England and the United States, who had been exploiting the Orient for over a century, and other hostile countries, and who had used the Shanghai area as a base for anti-Japanese activities for many years. Now, after about three months, the Japanese Army and Navy in Shanghai have fully understood the complex and diverse past plans of England, the United States, and other hostile countries in the Shanghai area and are focusing on the peaceful and happy life of the good citizens. They issued a joint statement by the Japanese Army and Navy in Shanghai on February 12th to clarify their direction. That is, the Army and Navy in Shanghai, out of deep concern for the welfare and well-being of the citizens, are making every effort to quickly import materials from Thailand, French Indochina, and other southern regions. However, the citizens should also be aware that hoarding must be eliminated, consumption must be reduced, and the entire strength of the Chinese people and land must be used to bring a large amount of materials into the Shanghai area. These materials should be combined with the existing materials in Shanghai to provide for the needs of the people. It is hoped that everyone will work hard to accomplish this. Therefore, the Japanese Army and Navy in Shanghai will set limits on the materials in Shanghai and use them effectively. To control the use, manufacture, and sale of all materials in the Shanghai area in the future, the Director-General of the Hua Central Liaison Department of the Asia Development Board will be responsible for controlling and using them. Therefore, the movement of important materials within the region will be controlled. However, this control of movement will be gradually lifted as the various control mechanisms for the use, manufacture, and sale of the listed items are completed. However, the provisional regulations for the control of the movement of materials in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, which were previously formulated and promulgated by the General Headquarters of the China Expeditionary Army and the Headquarters of the China Area Fleet, will still apply to the movement of materials from the Shanghai area to other areas or from outside the area to the Shanghai area. In addition, those who have already obtained a permit in accordance with the regulations do not need to be subject to the permission for the movement of materials within the area stipulated in this announcement. It is hoped that the citizens will understand and fully cooperate."

### A Visit to the Sacred Heart Hospital

A Paradise for the Welfare of Impoverished Children

No one should forget! Before the war, the Sacred Heart Hospital was one of the best-equipped and most life-saving hospitals in China. Its paving stone therapy made astonishing contributions to our country's medical field. Later, due to environmental reasons, after many setbacks, it moved from its original location on Ningguo Road in Yangshupu to its current location on Qiqi Road. However, some Shanghai people who love excitement and indulge in extravagance have probably forgotten it!

A three-story Western-style house, a red surrounding wall, encircling trees, and two porcelain plaques with four golden characters on the iron gate, this is the "Sacred Heart Hospital." There, it is shrouded in a tranquil atmosphere. Although it is only separated from the outside world by a wall, I feel as if they are two different worlds. On the green grass, I saw several patients strolling, and some were squatting down to study something. After explaining my intentions to a doorman, I was greeted by a Catholic nun. Her white clothing symbolizes the purity of her heart, and her kindness gave me a feeling of instant familiarity. It turned out her name was Sister Shen.

"How is your hospital doing recently?" I leaned in and asked her anxiously.

"Our hospital has fifty beds, but considering the countless impoverished patients outside who cannot be admitted, we also set up outpatient registration every morning, charging only a handling fee of six jiao, and also have free clinics. We hope that poor people can also enjoy some health and happiness," Sister Shen said slowly. Her face was filled with compassion, kindness, love, and enthusiasm.

"Your hospital's spirit of relief is truly great!" These were my thoughts, so I couldn't help but blurt them out. "How many doctors and nurses do you have?"

"The chief physician is Dr. Zhang Lianghui. In addition, there are over fifty nurses, including British and French head nurses, nurses, and student nurses."

Then, she accompanied me to visit the wards. There were ordinary rooms for three yuan a day and second-class rooms for five yuan a day. What interested me most was the "Children's Room." Those innocent and lively little angels were sitting around small tables playing with wooden ducks! Wooden elephants! Wooden trucks! Six-sided paintings! Nineteen small cradles were arranged parallel on both sides, with chamber pots and small chairs placed underneath. A small coffee table separated each bed. When they saw us, they all affectionately called "Mommy!" One little girl even rushed to hug Sister Shen's knee. Sister Shen told me that these were all orphans abandoned by their parents. The girl hugging her was already six years old. When she was two years old and not even two feet tall, she suffered from rickets and could not stand or talk at all. Her parents decided she was a monster and sent her here, but after more than a year of treatment by Dr. Zhang, she was finally cured.

"Look how lively she is!" Sister Shen had a proud expression.

"Has Sister Shen adopted any orphans recently?"

"We were preparing to, but due to funding difficulties and the recent lack of milk substitutes, we had to postpone it temporarily. It's already very difficult to support the orphans who are already here!" A cloud of sorrow flew onto her loving face. Yes, she felt sorrow for these poor orphans, worried about the many orphans who could not receive her kindness, and grieved for the suffering Chinese brethren!

"What about the older ones?"

"After the children turn ten, we send them to Jinan for foster care. There is a very large orphanage there that specializes in accepting orphans from all over. In addition to teaching, nurturing, and literacy, the boys learn a trade, and the girls learn needlework. They all have a skill. Every year, hundreds of pairs of orphans are matched up to become husband and wife and start their own businesses."

It was already eleven thirty! The maidservant brought the children their meals. Each had two dishes? Fresh fish and radishes. A white-clad angel even brought a bottle of cod liver oil and a kind of vitamin product to distribute to each bowl.

In today's world of expensive rice and firewood, I truly envied their nutrition!

When passing through the outpatient clinic, I saw nurses and student nurses working busily under the guidance of doctors.

Farewell, Sacred Heart - this haven for the sick and poor, a heaven of groans! I seemed to see a dark and rugged mountain road, where thousands upon thousands of suffering children were struggling, escaping the clutches of demons, and throwing themselves into the embrace of the god of light. What they relied on for rescue was this sacred Sacred Heart Hospital. (蓓蕾)

### Japanese Authorities Consider Repatriating Nationals of Various Countries, Including Those from Belligerent Nations and Countries with Severed Diplomatic Relations. Those Wishing to Leave Shanghai Should Register with the Japanese Consulate. Nationals of Britain, the United States, the Netherlands, and Belgium Are Not Included.

A Tongmeng News Agency dispatch from this city: Mr. Kawasaki, a spokesman for the Japanese Embassy, specially summoned news reporters for a meeting yesterday afternoon to disclose that the Japanese authorities are considering repatriating civilian enemy nationals, but have not yet agreed on a specific plan. The Japanese authorities are currently preparing to formulate an easily implementable plan. The Japanese Consulate General in Shanghai issued a notice on March 27.

Those Wishing to Leave Shanghai Should Register Immediately

It stated briefly that the Japanese authorities intend to repatriate nationals of enemy countries (excluding British, American, Dutch, and Belgian nationals) and nationals of countries that have severed diplomatic relations with Japan residing in Shanghai. Those wishing to leave Shanghai should register with the passport section of the Japanese Consulate General at the Li Cha Hotel within this month. The spokesman reiterated that the above notice does not apply to British, American, Dutch, and Belgian nationals, as the British and American governments, entrusted to the Swiss government, and the Belgian government, entrusted to the Swedish government, are already engaged in negotiations with the Japanese government to repatriate their respective nationals.

Applications for Repatriation Are Divided into Two Categories

Those applying for repatriation will be divided into two categories: non-permanent residents and residents. The first category includes diplomatic and consular personnel, government-appointed officials, correspondents and newspaper reporters, Red Cross personnel and their dependents, and travelers who happened to be in Shanghai at the time of the outbreak of war. The second category includes women, children, and those with special and sufficient reasons. Although the above notice only applies to nationals in the Shanghai area, Japanese consulates in other areas are now taking similar steps.

Dozens of Belligerent Nations

According to reports, the countries at war with Japan include the United States, the British Empire (including Great Britain, Northern Ireland, New Zealand, Canada, Australia, and South Africa), Haiti, Costa Rica, Honduras, Guatemala, Nicaragua, Dominican Republic, Cuba, Panama, the Netherlands, and Belgium. The countries that have severed diplomatic relations with Japan include Mexico, Egypt, Greece, Colombia, Venezuela, Peru, Uruguay, Brazil, Bolivia, Ecuador, Paraguay, Iran, and Iraq.

### Shanghai Municipal Council Urges Coal Conservation

A public announcement from the Shanghai Municipal Council's Information Office stated that in order to maintain coal reserves, the Council is specifically appealing to citizens to cooperate as much as possible, to be mindful of the difficulty of maintaining resources, and to strive for frugality in coal consumption. It is hoped that coal will no longer be used for heating after the end of this month.

### Commodity Prices

For Western-style houses, the Council will not send personnel to collect the property tax. Taxpayers should submit payment to the Council's Tax Collection Office at 109 Jiangxi Road after receiving the notice. Furthermore, the Council's tax collectors will carry identification documents with their photographs attached for identification. Taxpayers must pay attention to this.

### This Newspaper's Employees Collectively Donate to Education

Yesterday, a gentleman, using an anonymous name, donated 3,000 yuan to this newspaper's reader scholarship fund to benefit the poor students. His benevolence and righteousness are commendable. Although all the employees of this newspaper made a collective donation last year, they continue to donate this year to express their humble sincerity. Yesterday's donations received totaled 4,014 yuan, including 3,000 yuan from an anonymous donor (receipt number 134), 1,000 yuan from all employees of this newspaper, and 14 yuan from Mr. Tang. With the previous balance of 83,380 yuan and 8 jiao and 8 fen, the total now amounts to 87,394 yuan, 8 jiao, and 8 fen.

### Greek Jeweler Embezzles Huge Sum of Money

A Russian named Peerston, also known as Balabasch, opened a jewelry store at 304 Avenue Mesny in the French Concession. In May of last year, a Greek broker named Kaishana Chaizhalov (814-816 Avenue Joffre) sold jewelry and diamonds for Peerston, amounting to 116,738 yuan. All sale prices were paid by checks signed by Kaishana's lover, Su Laiweiqu (a Russian dancer residing at 353 Rue Corneille). Apart from the amount received by Peerston, 256,758 yuan was still owed. Although Peerston demanded payment from Kaishana, he kept delaying. In reality, Kaishana had used the money to buy a car worth over 20,000 yuan and was living with Su, spending his days in leisure. Peerston reported this information to the French police, accusing Kaishana Chaizhalov and the dancer Su Miweiqu of fraud. The police investigated and confirmed the facts, arresting Kaishana and Su and detaining them for investigation before handling the case according to law.

### Farmers' Sideline Business - Animal Husbandry: Youth Association Agricultural Lecture, Lecture by Shen Jiazheng

Most farmers cannot utilize their spare time. Once the busy farming season is over, they waste their time in teahouses and taverns. If they can adapt to local conditions and engage in animal husbandry production, the profits can be no less than agricultural production. What I am talking about today is just a brief overview. Animal husbandry emphasizes experience. Otherwise, it is better to start small to avoid significant losses.

Cattle

Farmers near urban areas can raise dairy cows. For example, if you raise 1,000 yuan, you can choose a small Holstein dairy cow that produces a lot of milk. Children over ten years old can be responsible for raising them. After two years, there will be at least five or six hundred yuan of income per month. Under the current situation, milk sheds and milk powder factories are in great demand. Currently, the price of raw milk is 1 yuan and 2 jiao per pound. Each cow produces 30 pounds of milk per day, yielding 36 yuan per day, and over 1,000 yuan per month. The most important thing in raising cows is to choose the breed. The best cows produce over 80 pounds per day. Next, it is necessary to prevent diseases, because dairy cows have weak resistance and are most susceptible to pleuropneumonia. Therefore, preventive injections must be given every summer and autumn. Management should not be neglected either.

Pigs

Pigs are the most common livestock, and their sales are very wide. However, the profits are not as good as dairy cows. Farmers raise pigs not only for their meat but also for their manure. Moreover, some of the residue from agricultural products can be used as pig feed, which can reduce costs. In the Xujiahui area, there are professional pig farmers who purchase leftovers from various restaurants. Although this is not very hygienic in the summer and autumn seasons, it is cheap and nutritious, which is quite economical. If the leftovers can be boiled to 100 degrees, it will be more hygienic. Recently, meat prices have been surprisingly expensive, and each fat pig can be worth around 1,000 yuan. If you raise sows, each sow can produce two litters of piglets per year, with eight piglets each time, resulting in sixteen piglets in two litters. Each piglet can be sold for 100 yuan after weaning, resulting in a stable income of 1,600 yuan per year. As for the breed of pigs, it is best to choose Chinese Jinhua pigs and Thai pigs or the foreign breed "Berkshire," because these three types of pigs grow quickly, have good meat quality, are tolerant of rough feed, and are easy to manage.

Sheep

Sheep are divided into two types: goats and wool sheep. Wool sheep are known for their wool, but they are suitable for raising in the colder areas of the north, so I won't discuss them in detail. Here, I will focus on the milk-producing breeds of goats. There are seven or eight varieties, but the "Chai Nai" breed is the most famous. It can produce about five pounds of milk per day, and up to ten pounds in some cases. The average milk production period is nine months per year, so it can produce about 1,500 pounds of milk per year. At 1 yuan and 3 jiao per pound, this is an income of about 2,000 yuan. Due to milk production, their feed should be better than that of ordinary goats in the countryside. For a milk goat weighing 50 pounds, the daily feed amount should be: 4 jin of dried grass, 2.5 jin of green grass, 3 jin of tofu dregs, 1.5 jin of wheat bran, 0.5 jin of barley, and 0.25 jin of soybean cake.

Rabbits

There are three types of rabbits: meat rabbits, wool rabbits, and fur rabbits. Raising wool rabbits and fur rabbits is more profitable. The "Angora" breed is the most famous for wool rabbits, especially the English variety, which has fine and long hair, over five or six inches, as fine as silk, which can be used to make cashmere yarn and other woolen products. Rabbit hair can be sheared four times a year, yielding more than half a pound of hair. At the current price of 80 yuan per pound, the annual income is 40 yuan. If you can dye and spin the yarn yourself, the cashmere yarn can fetch 300 yuan per pound at the current market price. Half a pound from one rabbit can earn one hundred and fifty or sixty yuan. As for the feed cost of fur rabbits, it is about the same as wool rabbits. The fur must be tanned before selling. In recent years, fur coats that are popular on the market are mostly made of rabbit fur. Each coat costs as much as two or three thousand yuan and is still selling well.

Chickens

Chickens are the most common poultry in rural sidelines. They are raised in both Eastern and Western countries. China has the earliest history of raising chickens, but because farmers lack scientific knowledge, they let them grow naturally in terms of breeding, feeding, and management. Therefore, chicken breeds are mixed, and they lay very few eggs. Generally, a chicken lays seventy or eighty eggs per year, which is worth only about 40 yuan at the current price. The chicken meat can be sold for 30 yuan, totaling 70 yuan, while the annual feed also costs this amount. As for the famous foreign "Leghorn" chickens, they can lay more than 150 to 300 eggs per year. The feed is similar to Chinese chickens, the eggs are larger, and the selling price is also more expensive. If you raise 300 chickens, you can earn more than 10,000 yuan throughout the year, which is more than enough to support a family of several people. However, those who want to engage in chicken farming must first choose good breeds, second, have complete equipment, and third, pay attention to the prevention of chicken diseases. If all three are met, success can be expected.

Bees

Although bees are small insects, the honey and wax they produce have a wide range of uses. In addition to medicinal use, honey can be used as a seasoning and nutritional product. Beeswax is an important industrial raw material and is indispensable for military and medical use. Therefore, all countries in the world raise them extensively. China's beekeeping industry is still not developed, and the bee breeds are inferior, resulting in low yields. The common good breed is the Italian bee, which is large in size, golden in color, and can produce 20 to 30 pounds to 50 pounds of honey per hive per year. At the current price of 4 yuan per pound, this can earn 100 to 200 yuan. In addition, there are also three or four pounds of beeswax, which can also be sold for 40 to 50 yuan. As for the bee breeds, each hive is about five frames, with 10,000 bees, and the price ranges from 150 yuan to 300 yuan. Therefore, beekeeping is most profitable in areas with abundant honey sources. Because in addition to purchasing bee breeds and preparing honey and wax tools, no feed consumption is required. And beekeeping is of great help to the pollination of crops. The plant types that they collect honey from include milk vetch, buckwheat, melons, rapeseed, citrus, apples, persimmons, and tea.

### Lin Gengbai Passes Away

Mr. Lin Gengbai, a famous figure in literary circles, lived in Hong Kong and unfortunately died in an accident on December 19 of last year. Whether known or unknown, everyone mourned his passing. Mr. Lin left behind five sons and daughters, all of whom are grown up. It is heard that his family in Shanghai will hold a sutra recitation at Yueming Buddhist Lodge at 44 Dashilu today (the 27th) to commemorate him.

### New Initiatives at the Dalu Zhuangyuan Restaurant

The Dalu Zhuangyuan Restaurant, located on the south side of Yu Qiaqing Road in the Dalu Hotel, is a major establishment of Ningbo cuisine in Shanghai. Recently, in view of the large number of Chinese and foreign ladies staying at the hotel, it is planning to expand its seating and renovate the grand ballroom. The restaurant has also added a variety of economical dishes, mostly casseroles and roasted meats, which are quite distinctive. At a time when the cost of living is increasing, it is well-suited to the needs of Shanghai residents.

Social Services

Unemployed Workers, Please Note: The China Underwear Company is commissioned to recruit several military uniform workers. Those who are familiar with underwear, shirts, and all sewing work are qualified.

### Yesterday's Friendly Football Match: Hequn and French Army Draw, No Score in Either Half

In a friendly football match, the emerging strong team Hequn challenged the French Army. The game was held at the Donghua Stadium on Bixun Road yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM. The crowd was thousands of spectators. Hequn and the French Army fought to a tense 0-0 draw. Hequn kicked off, with Han Longhai leading the three armies and launching an attack. Overcoming the last line of defense, Xiao Ziwen kicked hard, but the French Army goalkeeper Le Fan was very agile and saved it as a corner kick, turning danger into safety. The French army was unwilling to be outdone, and veteran Mr. Xin attacked alone. He swept from 20 yards, but Hequn's Zhang Banglun saw the dangerous ball and jumped high to save it. In the first half, neither side scored. At the resumption of play, the French army's central defender Mann was ambitious and attempted to invade the Central Plains. Dai Linjing recognized his plan and突出的中央, and Tang Zuo jointly advanced. Unfortunately, Cao Lingfang lost his footing and did not succeed. Soon, time was up, and each side gave the other a goose egg (no score).

### Favorable News: The Bond Market is Gradually Prospering; Chinese and Western Stocks Also Rise

The grey market for public bonds was quite smooth at the beginning of yesterday's session. Sellers seemed to be putting high pressure, but buyers were very enthusiastic, taking up every offer. Sellers had already sold a lot the day before, and their momentum was weakening, so prices rose gradually. Among them, Category D was the most crowded. It opened at 58 yuan and 1 jiao, and buyers flocked in, instantly rising to north of 1 yuan. Generally, the opening price was changed to 8 yuan and 3 jiao. At that time, Dakangcheng, the seller, had only 200,000 to 300,000 yuan left, and it felt like there was too little porridge for too many monks, and even higher at 9 yuan and 5 jiao. Category D was uniquely cheap, and everyone flocked to it. It was the only one that fell the day before, but yesterday it rose the most. Tongli, Hongda, Runli, Hongxing, Dafeng, and Yitai all bought in. Dakangcheng, Hu Heji, Zhongyi, and Lianhe supplied more. Others like Hengtai and Baolong also offered some. The market price was still in short supply, gradually prospering. It was heard that there was favorable news, and sentiment was firm. The market situation turned strong, and the result continued to rise by 3-5 jiao to 1 yuan and 4 jiao. The turnover was approximately 1.1 million yuan. A brief table is listed below.

### Gold Reverses Course from Rise to Fall; Military Notes Also See Decline

The cash market, previously overheated, has reversed its course from rising to falling. After briefly exceeding the 19,000 yuan mark, it quickly entered a consolidation phase. Gold registration, it is heard, has been extended for three days until the deadline. More physical gold is coming onto the market, and sentiment across the board is softening. This is also due to the weakness of Japanese military notes. In the morning, the market initially followed the upward momentum from the previous day's close, rising by 400 yuan and reaching the 19,000 yuan mark. It then fell to 18,900 yuan. A certain gold shop suddenly entered with strong buying, and Cheng Ji, De Fu, and retail investors also followed suit enthusiastically. The price was pushed up by 500 yuan, reaching a high of 19,400 yuan. Suddenly, He Fa came in with heavy selling, and Yong Feng Yu, Sheng Da, Yong Tong Kang Yong, and silver shop groups scrambled to sell. Hong Qing Yong Gong and others engaged in arbitrage. Cotton yarn prices plummeted, causing the price to fall by 1,000 yuan, reaching a low of 18,400 yuan at noon. The noon closing price was 18,450 yuan, 150 yuan lower than the previous day's noon close and 250 yuan lower than the afternoon price. The intraday fluctuation was 1,000 yuan. In the afternoon, the price fell to 18,300 yuan and then rebounded to 18,400 yuan. Silver shop jewelry gold was initially quoted by Da Xin and other shops at 5 shi wu higher per tael, at 2,000 yuan, but quickly fell by 100 yuan, to 1,900 yuan (with a 200 yuan discount for purchases). Small silver ingots were priced at 50 yuan lower. Silver was quoted at 20 yuan per tael, and the black market price was around 14 yuan. Silver dollars rose again to 8 yuan and 78 jiao, it is said.

Foreign currency market conditions: British and American gold pounds each fell by 10 yuan, with the former at 410 yuan and the latter at 420 yuan. U.S. dollar bills remained at 25-26 yuan. Hong Kong dollars remained at 3 yuan and 5 jiao, with large bills down by 1 jiao. Military notes fell to 7 yuan 2 jiao 5 fen in the afternoon, before finally settling at 7 yuan 3 jiao 5 fen.

### Cotton Yarn Registration Resumes; Selling Pressure on Double Horse Brand Increases

Cotton yarn market conditions: Starting high, then falling, the trend has turned weak. This is because cotton yarn registration has resumed, causing a loss of confidence and a downward trend. The initial price for 20-count Double Horse brand yarn was 3,550 yuan, which rose to 3,630 yuan due to strong demand. However, some long position holders took advantage of the high price to sell, and selling pressure increased, gradually falling to 3,400 yuan at closing. 42-count Blue Phoenix was priced at 8,850-9,000 yuan, 60-count Li Ma at 10,300 yuan, 60-count Bull Head at 18,200 yuan, 60-count Cai Lu at 21,000 yuan, 40-count Jin Cheng at 8,000 yuan, 20-count Yue Qin at 4,425-4,500 yuan, 20-count Hong Kui Xing at 4,300 yuan, 20-count Tian Nu at 4,300 yuan, 20-count Double Globe at 4,390 yuan, 20-count Double Horse at 4,450 yuan, 20-count Wu Zi at 4,100 yuan, 20-count Blue Phoenix at 5,200 yuan, 16-count Hong Kui Xing at 4,400 yuan, 16-count Globe at 4,230 yuan, 16-count Jin Ta at 4,350 yuan, 17-count Cai Qiu at 4,200 yuan, 16-count Da Bao at 4,200 yuan, 10-count Hong Bao Yi at 2,900 yuan, 10-count Tong Zi Jun at 3,100 yuan, and 10-count Hong Double Horse at 3,140 yuan.

### Factory Cloth Sold for Profit; Selling Pressure Causes Prices to Fall

Factory cloth: Yesterday's market trended weaker because retail investors sold for profit, and new hoarders were afraid to buy due to registration requirements. Therefore, most selling prices fell. White cloth fell by 2-5 yuan, bleached and dyed cloth fell by 2-3 yuan, and poplin and thread tweed fell by 5 fen to 1 jiao per yard. Da Peng fine cloth was 175 yuan, Fu Gui fine cloth was 172 yuan, 16-pound Fei Hong coarse cloth was 173 yuan, 14-pound Lu coarse cloth was 157 yuan, 8-pound Zhen Zhong coarse cloth was 94 yuan, Chick brand shirting was 267.5 yuan, and White Cat printed cloth was 135 yuan. The total transaction volume for various cloths on this street was over 500 pieces.

Eastern cloth: Yesterday, due to the decline in Japanese military notes, market prices fell. Longtou fine cloth new contracts opened at 218-219 yuan in the morning and softened to 210.05 yuan at noon. In the afternoon, they fell to 204 yuan twice, but the middle-range fine cloth and the spot Longtou dealers continued to absorb them, so the Longtou new contracts rebounded to 208 yuan at closing. Cai Qiu Fei Yu was 192.5 yuan, Yang He was 191.5 yuan, La Ba was 191 yuan, Wu Fu fine twill was 167 yuan, and Si Jun Zi serge late futures fell to 6.4 yuan. Hong Dan new tax was 6.26 yuan.

### Horsehair Lining Price Alone Weakens

Yesterday, the woolen fabric market remained tight. The prices of all goods, whether spring and autumn fancy suiting, serge, water tweed, summer white goods, feather yarn, Wannading, winter overcoating, riding breeches, feather yarn lining, fancy cloth for western suits, soft lining, or black charcoal lining, all saw significant increases. Only horsehair lining has recently seen a price decrease. Previously sold at 3 yuan per yard, it is now only selling for 1.8 yuan, which can be said to be extremely rare.

### Retail Price of Foreign Rice to Increase to 2 Yuan Per Sheng Starting Tomorrow

The Shanghai Municipal Council's low-priced foreign rice will increase its retail price to 2 yuan per sheng starting March 28th. Broken rice will be 1.7 yuan per sheng.

Recently, the selling price of domestic rice has been very unstable and chaotic. The prices are lower in the urban area. Yesterday, it was rumored that early and late rice were 390 yuan, 385 yuan, and 380 yuan. In the French Concession, it was 368-369 yuan to 366-367 yuan. In the urban area, it was only 330-340 yuan. Hawkers increased their prices slightly, from 38 yuan to 35 yuan per dou. Shops mostly sell at 3.7-3.8 yuan to 4 yuan per sheng. Glutinous rice has been out of stock for a long time, with only some old goods being sold off. Newly opened original packaged Jin Tan white yuan rice, including the bag, is 400 yuan.

### Speculation in Coarse Grains Slightly Slackens

The coarse grain market remains dull, and speculation remains weak. Actual users are not buying aggressively, so the market continues to lack vitality. Bean prices have fallen by another 3-5 yuan, and bean cakes have also fallen by 2 yuan. The rest also show little sign of improvement. It is estimated that 100 bags of Kai Ping Hu Du beans were sold at 210 yuan, 20 bags of Pu Dong yellow beans at 201 yuan, Tianjin Jin Yuan 40 yuan at 227-228 yuan, and 300 bags of Yun beans at 220-215 yuan. Ping Hu red beans were 30 bags at 195 yuan, Chong Ming sand red over 200 bags at 195-190 yuan, and sand silkworms were 200 bags at 139-133 yuan. Wu Jiang picked Qing beans were 50 bags at 203 yuan, Ben Niu cowpea 15 bags at 188 yuan, Shan Dong raw kernels were 100 bags at 340 yuan, Ming Guang red sorghum was one cart at 133 yuan, Nanjing Xue Ma was 40 bags at 290 yuan, Ming Guang white Ma 70 bags at 222-275 yuan, Wu Hu white Ma was 50 bags at 250 yuan, Li Zi bean cake March warehouse receipt 1,000 pieces priced at 52.5 yuan, Shen Ji bean cake 2,500 pieces, May warehouse receipt priced at 51.2 yuan to 50 yuan.

### Longkou Vermicelli Gradually Rises by 100 Yuan

Longkou vermicelli, a wonderful product for adding to meals, can be added to any soup. Now, with the price of everything soaring, the price has risen by 100 yuan in the past two weeks. Yesterday's market price was 600 yuan. Qingdao vermicelli, which is of higher quality, was 540 yuan.

### Cigarette Prices Rebound

Yesterday's cigarette market situation: rumors of profitable buying were not strong, and various parties came to buy again. Holders took the opportunity to sell, so prices rebounded. Da Ying brand was initially quoted at 11,000 yuan per case, resulting in buyers paying 10,900 yuan, with some transactions, 900 yuan higher than the previous day. Lao Dao brand was 9,400 yuan, Wu Hua brand was 6,000 yuan, Pin Hai brand was 7,500 yuan, and Xiao Xian Nu brand was 6,250 yuan. The market was generally stable, up 100 yuan from the previous day. Japanese cigarettes Jin Qiang brand was 3,140 yuan, Jin Tian Lou was 3,150 yuan, Hong Mei Gui brand was 2,175 yuan, and Guo Yan Bai Jin Long brand was 7,400 yuan, all higher.

### Apples (4)

— Gao Jiannong

I brought it back and planted it. After three years, it bore five fruits. "The taste was like Nai (crabapple) and also like Lin Qin (another type of apple)," very juicy, exceptionally sour and delicious! I sent it to the county, and then to the state, because of its unique taste. Later, the tree grew large, bearing up to 300 fruits. Every year, I presented them as tribute, calling them "Zhu Nai." They still exist today. The states of De Bei Bo and others took its branches for grafting, resulting in abundant yields everywhere. People believed that they floated from the Western Regions, stopped by the shallows and settled there. This passage says, "The taste was like Nai and also like Lin Qin," clearly indicating that it was slightly different from both Nai and Qin; "called Zhu Nai" was because they didn't know what it was actually called, so they could only compare it to the names of existing fruits. If this isn't an apple tree, what else could it be? Assuming someone doesn't acknowledge that Nai is an apple, at least now they should acknowledge that we already had real apple trees in the Dao era! Furthermore, it says, "The states of De Bei Bo and others took its branches for grafting, resulting in abundant yields everywhere." This clearly records the reason why there are so many apple trees in Hebei Province now! This is truly a unique and excellent historical source!

The Tang Dynasty was the most flourishing period for translating Buddhist scriptures, and Buddhist terms were naturally most widely known at this time. Indeed, the term "Pin Po Guo" (apple) started precisely at this time. According to the "Taiping Guangji," quoting a book called "Qia Kai Ji," "During the Yonghui reign of the Tang Dynasty, Wang Fangyan, a villager from Wang Guo Village in Lin Huang, Wei Prefecture, once picked up a small tree on a river beach and planted it. When it grew, it turned out to be a Lin Qin. The fruit was larger than a small yellow gourd, white as jade, with vermilion spots... bright and dazzling, and exceptionally beautiful... He presented it to Emperor Gaozong, who named it Zhu Nai, also known as Five-Colored Lin Qin, or Lian Zhu Guo, and planted it in the imperial garden... The Emperor valued it greatly and bestowed the title of Wen Lin Lang upon Wang Fangyan. The local people call the fruit 'Pin Po Guo.' There are many Lin Qin trees in Hedong, and quite a few in Qin, as well as in the western prefectures, but all are smaller than the Wen Lin fruit." Zhenguan and Yonghui were the reign titles of Emperors Taizong and Gaozong of the Tang Dynasty, respectively. Dunqiu and Lin Huang were adjacent places. Is this passage about the same event as the one recorded in "Chaoye Qianzai"? I say, regardless, if they are two events, it is sufficient to show that the introduction of apple trees was not just a one-time occurrence. Even if it is the same event, it further proves the authenticity of this historical record, and we can also use this later record to solve the question of the origin of the name "Pin Po Guo." - Guo Qituo's "Zhong Shu Shu" already had the name "Pin Po," but I believe this book is clearly a forgery, so I don't take it into account.

Commentary

### The Story of "A Donkey in Tiger Skin"

— Jin Yi

The trick of borrowing a name to swindle and deceive seems to have existed since ancient times, and is even more prevalent today. From holding the emperor hostage to command the lords to hawking light bulbs, all are variations of this trick. But since it is a trick, there is always some secrecy and furtiveness. If it succeeds, that is naturally best; if it fails, there is still room to cover up. To "wear a red cross armband and a copper badge" and engage in a fraudulent business in such a formal manner, it is certain that the case of borrowing the name of the Shanghai Municipal Council's Food Administration is the originator.

Today, when foreign rice is running out, domestic rice is as precious as pearls, and even buying red beans requires queuing, the act of "registering household food rations and distributing grain according to households" is naturally a welcomed and celebrated act of benevolence. However, where is the profit for these unscrupulous people? Is it just to swindle a few registration fees? There seems to be a subtle mystery that the newspaper does not fully disclose.

The inferior commoners who live day-to-day are indeed often unable to both queue and eat, and the higher-class residents whose rice bags are piled high at home and who still offer prices to rice brokers are also common. If a survey of all households in Shanghai is conducted today, in addition to those whose homes have no rice left, I think the second number will definitely exceed those "high-class collectors" who "have food stored for a month." They are just like the rice weevils of the past, thinking that as long as they are "fearless and unburdened," all will be well. The important reason for the appearance of the revised version of the story of "a donkey in tiger skin" probably lies in this.

The revised version of the story of "a donkey in tiger skin" is of course not just this case of "wearing a red cross armband and a copper badge." Where there is opportunity, there is no place that cannot be penetrated; however, it is precisely because there are "holes" that it is possible to teach the donkey the skill. Now, locking oneself in a rice warehouse is not the safest way. The recent implementation measures for food by the authorities of the two concessions have their own steps, and these steps are a universal "everyone has food to eat." Understanding this, the unscrupulous people will have no way to put on a tiger skin and act as a guide.

### Sickness and Rice

— Wang Ye

There is an "advertisement" on the classified ads of this newspaper: "Zhang Fei of the Three Kingdoms once said to Kong Ming: I am not afraid of anyone. Kong Ming wrote the word 'sickness' on his palm and asked him if he was afraid or not? Fei shouted, 'Aiyo!' This shows that even heroes and strongmen cannot bear the suffering of life..." etc.

The price of rice during the Three Kingdoms period has not been accurately recorded in historical records, but the price of rice at several hundred yuan per dan must not have been within Kong Ming's divine calculations. Even if we say, "rice is up," rice still needs to be squeezed out, right? Zhang Fei had the prestige of scaring away Cao's soldiers at Hulin Bridge, so one sheng a day would not be a problem. Moreover, Zhang Fei may also have had a "rice squeezing party": Liu Bei, Guan Gong... A Dou, etc. But this "hero and strongman" actually "shouted Aiyo" when he saw the mere word "sickness," which shows that the terror of sickness at that time was a hundred million times greater than that of rice. Otherwise, why didn't old Mr. Kong Ming write the word "rice" on his palm?

Our twentieth-century "protagonists" overturned the "common view" that "a hero is only afraid of sickness grinding him down" and made a new conclusion, saying: "A hero is only afraid of having no rice." And there is still supporting evidence: that is, sickness can sometimes be delayed, but without food, a woman will die in seven days, and a "great husband" will be finished in three days.

### Sharing the Same Boat in Storms

— He Jia Zhi

(1) Sorrow and Joy

Someone went to his house and saw two slogans posted that seemed to make sense but didn't: "I will do anything to make money; I will not do anything that loses money." This statement doesn't exactly portray him. He and the Ye family later had some connections, because after Ye Aitang passed away, Ye's first wife handled the funeral and dealt with the debts. She sold more than 20 mu of farmland near the Wei family's residence to Wei Yunqing. Wei did not show any recollection of the embarrassment that Mr. Ye had given him during his lifetime. Instead, he made more than 20 payments, saying, "Money in hand, food in mouth. Mrs. Ye, you should take it slowly and spend it slowly."

Today, he suddenly came to the Ye family. Ye's second wife and Li Youxie, in their busyness, came out to greet him. They saw a short old man standing on the ground, wearing a big red wind hat and a black cloth mandarin jacket. It had five buttons, three of which were still fastened with copper grape buttons, but two were missing. One hand was lifting the front of his blue cloth gown, looking very heavy. Li Youxie forced a smile amidst his sorrow and asked, "Mr. Wei, where are you coming from? What are you carrying? Please sit down." Wei Yunqing sat down and smiled, "I'm back from my son-in-law's house. This is broken tiles and bricks that I picked up along the way. After picking them up for three years, I can build a public pit. Selling manure can also get a few dozen copper coins, enough for our Shao Yun to buy cigarettes. Mr. Li, I just walked past the door and heard Ye's long-term worker say that the eldest lady is gone. Is it true?" Ye's second wife said, "Yes, our eldest lady has passed away. Her son is not married, and the funeral arrangements have not been prepared." (34)

### The Price of Time

— Ma Shang

"An inch of time is an inch of gold, but an inch of gold cannot buy an inch of time."

Time is precious.

Like asking the price of soap one hour, it is 220 yuan per case. Going to buy it an hour later, it is 223 yuan.

But Auntie Mao went to squeeze rice, queuing for four or five hours, hungry, and came back with empty hands. It turned out that the rice had been sold out, "Please come early tomorrow."

Thus, time has been divided into two prices.

### The Pain of Buying Bread

— Wei Mo

The smooth and round bread, looking warm and tempting, is especially evocative today when rice is as expensive as pearls. Mentioning the word "bread" inevitably makes people feel a little "uncomfortable" in their mouths. The bread problem has been debated for a long time, but a proper solution has not been found. Now, even buying bread has become a painful thing. What else can be said?

Yes, places like Sullivan, Yili, Wing On, Sincere... etc., do sell bread. In normal times, when food is plentiful, one would rarely buy a loaf, and even then, it would have to be sandwiched with ham, sardines, or heavily smeared with white tower oil or jam before one would even consider eating it. Simply put, one wouldn't even glance at it. However, today, buying bread has entered the "squeezing" battle, and finding bread has become a specialized "skill."

"Bread Sold Out" - whether it's "sold out" or "finished selling," let's not worry about it. Every time I pass Yili or Sullivan, it always flashes before my eyes, as if "sold out" is the only thing that can be expressed about bread. Sometimes, I happen to see one or two loaves, well-wrapped and stored in the counter. These are the customers' deposits, and cannot be parted with.

So, I can only start looking for "miscellaneous brand" bread. Once, I saw a few French-style long loaves piled in the corner of a window in a candy store on Avenue Road. I went in and bought one, which felt quite light in my hand, and looked thin, surely "underweight." Sure enough, I casually put it on a scale, and the needle jumped around, always around nine taels, unable to even reach ten taels. The price was 1.5 yuan, which was a bit disappointing.

The so-called standard family bread, priced at 1.4 yuan per loaf, now requires at least 1.8 yuan to buy. A lighter material can be bought for 1.7 yuan. Where the standard is, customers are not clear, and everyone is only concerned with being able to buy, and will not study it in detail.

When the entire batch of bread arrives, everyone shouts and rushes to buy it, with dozens of hands raised high, like doing business in the market. Almost a group of regular customers have been waiting there for a long time at this time, waiting for the "honor." So, after a batch of bread is taken off the bread truck, it cannot wait to be placed in the window, and within a dozen minutes, it is bought up by those group customers.

The shops do not welcome this way of selling, as they feel that these surging customers are difficult to deal with, and if they are not handled well, some people can buy it and some can't, inevitably offending customers. As for the conversion of currency and the trouble of making change, the procedures are even more complicated.

Some stores have even created names such as "package delivery" and "special transport." Of course, they are all "sages of the times." Businessmen are quick-witted, so it's no wonder they take this route. But once you inquire about the prices under this system, you feel that the taste of bread is far worse than before, and it is even more difficult to swallow.

### New Reincarnation Education

— Rooster

Nankai University in Tianjin had a "strike teaching" incident around 1922 and 1923. The reason was that there was an article on the school journal titled "Reincarnation Education," which roughly said: the way out for the educated is only to educate others again. I don't know if the professors at Nankai University at that time were too sensitive, thinking that it was sarcastic, and demanding that the school authorities punish the author. But they couldn't find out the real name of the author for a while, so the professors "struck teaching" to demonstrate. Over time, the four words "reincarnation education" have become popular and become colloquial. It is said that later not only did the author of "reincarnation education" jump out of reincarnation, but before the incident he had served as the director of the North China Unified Tax Bureau. And the professors who were referred to as reincarnated ones also "became officials after excelling in teaching." Or they became vice ministers and ministers, or ambassadors and secretaries general; at the very least, they became department chiefs and counselors. I think they can't help but smirk when they think of the scene of "blood surging" back then: "Reincarnation, indeed!" "Reincarnation, indeed!"

Times have changed, and the "way of reincarnation has also changed. My friend returned from studying in France, and neither "learned well to teach," nor "learned well to become an official," but spent all his time outside of sleeping, eating, and shitting in the dance halls. It is said that this is based on the latest principle of "learning well to dance," and he often criticizes "dance stars" based on "dance theory." Some friends who were skeptical deliberately rebutted him, but he was eloquent and persuasive. Not only were those present defeated, but even outsiders like me were impressed. Whenever there is a discussion, he can cite extensively and can take out several French dance books to prove it. He said very sincerely: "Don't think I'm fooling you because you don't understand French. Look, there are pictures to prove it! There are pictures to prove it!" Sure enough, my friends "learned to read from pictures" a long time ago, and now they have progressed to "learning to dance from pictures!" After many friends were instructed by him for free, they each became "highly skilled in dancing" and "fly with dance" day and night. My friend is not satisfied with this, and often says that when transportation is unimpeded in the future, he must go abroad to study "dance skills" in detail.

A few days ago, I had a dream that my friend had already returned from studying abroad again. He has written a book on dance hall management and the management of dance stars. Everyone calls him the Emperor of the Dance Country. After his advocacy, not only are dance halls everywhere, but all women dance, and no men don't dance. "Hearing the crow of the rooster, they dance," and it is even more prevalent now. Thus, China has the name of Dance Country, and the people have the title of Dance People. "Learning well to dance," and "dancing well to learn," round and round, "reincarnating" endlessly, not knowing that the East is already white.

Eau de cologne, medicated soap, mosquito coils... are all being "bought at high prices" in the classified ads.

There is no summer in Shanghai this year!
