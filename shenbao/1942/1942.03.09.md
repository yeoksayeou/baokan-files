### Telecommunications Disrupted, Situation Critical: Fierce Fighting Near Bandung; Outnumbered, Bandung May Be Difficult to Defend; Dutch East Indies Forces Still Resisting Valiantly

Reuters, Bandung, March 8th: Telecommunications between Bandung and the outside world have been severed. The last message issued by the Dutch news agency is as follows: It is reported that the situation in western Java has become extremely critical after the Japanese army, with superior forces, breached the northern defense line of Mount Tangkuban Perahu last Friday. Although the Dutch forces in that area fought to the death to resist the Japanese army, they were ultimately outnumbered and subjected to Japanese air strikes, and have now retreated. The famous volcano is indeed one of the world's famous scenic spots. As for the fighting in Bandung, the Dutch forces have been fighting for two days and nights without rest. They are also outnumbered in the air and on the ground, and have abandoned their original positions. Although fierce fighting is still ongoing, it is difficult to predict whether it can last. However, given the relentless Japanese attacks and the complete freedom they have gained in the air, Bandung may inevitably be abandoned.

Haitong News Agency, Saigon, March 8th: A Bandung radio station reporter, in his final report, stated that the majority of the Dutch air force was assisting in the defense of the useless Malaya, resulting in the dramatic changes in the Dutch East Indies today. The strategic errors of the Allied forces have led to an irreversible situation in the Dutch East Indies. The situation in western Java is particularly serious. The British had claimed that reinforcements would arrive in February, but they have not yet arrived. The Japanese army's encirclement from all sides has made the situation in Java increasingly serious. Although the Dutch forces are conducting counterattacks, they are ineffective due to the lack of a sufficient number of air forces. Although some American bombers have arrived, they are unable to do anything without the protection of fighter planes.

Havas, London, March 7th: The Dutch authorities here have just announced that fierce fighting took place throughout the day on the Javanese front today, especially near Bandung. However, no reports have yet been received on the situation.

Havas, New York, March 7th: It has been learned that the Dutch East Indies military headquarters in Bandung telegraphed the U.S. government, stating that the position of the Allied forces in Java should be regarded as "extremely serious."

Havas, San Francisco, March 7th: The Australian Federal Broadcasting Station issued a message today stating that the large number of Allied aircraft destroyed on the ground is the main reason for the Japanese army's progress in Java and the Dutch East Indies islands. For example, several American-made Flying Fortresses were destroyed on the ground before takeoff. From this, it can be seen that only a large number of anti-aircraft guns firing barrage fire can effectively deal with the Japanese air force's lightning tactics.

Haitong News Agency, Saigon, March 8th: The Bandung broadcasting station stopped broadcasting at 2:00 PM yesterday. At that time, the announcer, after reporting on the battle situation, announced that broadcasting would resume when the situation improved.

Bandung-U.S.-British Telecommunications Disrupted

Havas, Washington, March 7th: Telegraphic communication between the United States and Bandung, the temporary capital of the Dutch East Indies, has been disrupted since this morning.

Long live the Queen, goodbye, hope the situation will improve soon." In addition, communication between Java and London has largely been disrupted. However, the authorities have not issued any statement on this matter.

Reuters, New York, March 8th: Telecommunications between the United States and Bandung were disrupted at 7:55 AM (Eastern wartime time) yesterday morning.

As for whether telecommunications in other parts of Java are still open, there is no confirmed news.

Reuters, New York, March 8th: According to reports from Los Angeles, a Dutch radio station has begun broadcasting in the Javanese frequency, with the reporter speaking in Dutch. However, due to bad weather, the broadcast is difficult to hear. Reports from Los Angeles also state that the area received Dutch-language broadcasts from a Dutch radio station in Australia today.

Reuters, London, March 8th: It has been revealed that there has been no telegraphic communication between London and the Dutch East Indies since the afternoon of yesterday (Saturday).

Haitong News Agency, Tokyo, March 8th: According to reliable but unconfirmed reports, the Dutch East Indies command has requested an armistice.

Havas, Rome, March 8th: According to unconfirmed reports from the Stefani News Agency in Tokyo, the Commander-in-Chief of the Dutch East Indies has requested an armistice from the Japanese authorities. Several Dutch officers are conducting negotiations with the Japanese authorities.

Surabaya in Critical Condition Under Heavy Japanese Attack

Allied News Agency, Bern, Switzerland, March 7th: In the Java war, the Japanese army's pressure on Surabaya is intensifying rapidly. The port is now within the firing range of the Japanese army. The Japanese army's intense artillery fire and the Japanese air force are mutually supporting each other. The Japanese army, targeting Bandung, has further increased the intensity of its offensive, breaking through the outer defensive positions of the Dutch East Indies forces and approaching the outskirts of Bandung. Yesterday (the 6th), the Japanese army occupied Yogyakarta, a key point 25 kilometers from the southern coast of Java, cutting the island of Java into east and west sections. Apart from Surabaya and Bandung, what remains of the Dutch East Indies forces now (the 7th) are only Ma Renling, 300 kilometers northeast of Bandung, and Ma Er, 130 kilometers south of Surabaya. The Japanese army's control of the entire island is only a matter of time.

Haitong News Agency, Lisbon, March 8th: The National Broadcasting Company of New York announced yesterday afternoon that the port facilities of the Surabaya naval base have been automatically destroyed by the Allied forces due to the increasing proximity of the Japanese army.

### The Fall of Batavia

Allied News Agency, Tokyo, March 8th: After the Japanese army entered Batavia, the capital of the Dutch East Indies, on March 5th, a reporter from the Asahi Shimbun sent the first detailed report from the city today, stating that after the Dutch army withdrew from Batavia, the Dutch municipal authorities remained in the city to cooperate and hand over administrative control. Therefore, the Japanese army occupied it without firing a shot. The Japanese army entered Batavia at 8:30 PM, one hour and twenty-six minutes after the Japanese vanguard reached the northern suburbs of Batavia. Dutch officials went to the northern suburbs to meet the Japanese army and informed them that Batavia had been declared a undefended city. The Asahi reporter described the situation of the Japanese army entering the city as follows: When we reached a small river seven kilometers north of Batavia, we suddenly saw a team of Dutch East Indies people holding a white flag on the opposite bank. The Japanese army ordered them to be introduced. When the Dutch East Indies people said that they represented the Batavia municipal authorities and citizens to surrender to the Japanese army, the Japanese commander, knowing that Batavia had been declared a undefended city and that all the Allied forces had withdrawn, ordered the city to be entered. The Japanese army followed the commander in cars provided by the municipal government, flowing into the city, passing through the streets. The natives and Caucasians cheered along the way. When we arrived in the city, the Japanese commander was already discussing with the mayor and governor methods to maintain order in the Japanese-occupied area. The meeting was held in the residence of the Dutch official who led the truce mission. At that time, a large number of Dutch people gathered in front of the house, shouting "Down with the Netherlands and democracy." About ten Dutch East Indies people tore down the flag of the Dutch official and hung it on the roof of a street corner, creating a situation that was difficult to control. The Japanese army arrived at the scene to suppress it before it subsided. The Japanese army entered Batavia in an orderly manner without firing a shot, which is particularly significant.

### Hitler and His Aides Reportedly Arrive in Ukraine; Will Establish Headquarters to Command Offensive; Fierce Fighting in Leningrad

Havas, London, March 8th: German leader Hitler is rumored to have arrived in a certain city in Ukraine with his close aides, planning to establish headquarters there in order to command the spring offensive.

Haitong News Agency, German Leader's Headquarters, March 8th: This afternoon's German war report stated that the enemy's elite troops launched several fierce attacks east of Belkov, but failed. The fighting on the northern and central fronts continues. The German army counterattacked several times. The Soviet army resisted stubbornly, but ultimately could not stop the German advance. More than 3,000 Soviet soldiers were killed, and many were captured, including one division commander. German destroyer formations shot down 22 Soviet planes, and German planes attacking Soviet airfields destroyed nine more Soviet planes.

Havas, Berlin, March 8th: The authorities have just announced that General Meng Dan, commander of the German forces in the Crimean region, has been promoted to general by leader Hitler for his meritorious service in combat.

Haitong News Agency, Berlin, March 8th: According to a review of the war situation by German authorities, the recent fighting on the Eastern Front has not resulted in any major changes to the front lines. Spring has arrived in the Crimean Peninsula, and thawing is visible everywhere. Due to the changing weather, the Soviet army believes that the situation will worsen, so they have doubled their efforts in Kerch and Sevastopol, but without success. The Soviet forces in the Donets Basin have also achieved little. The situation on the eastern front has also remained unchanged. Although the weather near Lake Ilmen and Leningrad has turned severely cold again, the fighting has been quite fierce, but the front lines remain the same.

Havas, Berlin, March 7th: The German High Command has just issued a war report stating that the Red Army on the Eastern Front has launched several fierce attacks against our side in recent days, but all have been repelled with heavy losses. The first time was on the 5th of this month when the Soviet army attacked us, and we captured 900 people, recovered 5,407 bodies, and forced them to retreat to their original positions. The second time was on the 6th of this month. Our air force was extremely active on the northern front, and severely damaged a Soviet infantry unit. Our army also captured five artillery pieces, cars, and many sleds.

Havas, Romania, March 7th: An official communiqué stated that the Soviet Union had prepared to launch a large-scale offensive starting on March 4th, but due to weather conditions, it was ultimately unable to take any military action on the Kerch Peninsula. This was because huge ice floes were drifting with the current, disrupting all navigation and preventing the Red Army from receiving reinforcements from the Taman Peninsula. According to neutral observers, the Soviet Union has already missed the opportunity to recover the Kerch Peninsula. If the Red Army had prepared earlier, it would have been easy to occupy this peninsula at the end of last December. Also, if the Red Army had been able to block the Perekop Isthmus, preventing Axis reinforcements from reaching the front lines, the Crimean Peninsula might have fallen into the hands of the Red Army in January of this year.

Haitong News Agency, Stockholm, March 8th: According to sources here in London, the British people have received new orders from the authorities stipulating how the people should respond in the event of an invasion of Britain. The order states that if Britain is invaded by the enemy, the church bells should be rung urgently, and all manpower must automatically concentrate behind the front lines.

The order concludes that these provisions are only preventive measures, so all organizations are only regulations on paper.

### France: Cars Vanish, Bicycles Flourish

Havas News Agency Short Dispatch: Today in France, cars are as rare as phoenix feathers and unicorn horns. However, the number of bicycles in use nationwide is no less than ten million. A few years ago, the number never exceeded 300,000. Since the signing of the armistice agreement between France and Germany, France has faced a severe shortage of raw materials. Cars have become an impossible luxury. Only a few trains continue to run, and public buses have been greatly reduced. Every vehicle is packed without an inch of space. Under such circumstances, the people of the country have no choice but to rely on bicycles for transportation. As a result, the supply of bicycles in the country cannot meet the demand. The various manufacturing plants now have 100,000 mechanics working day and night to speed up production. Although the consumption of coal, steel, iron, aluminum, rubber, and leather is restricted nationwide, the various manufacturing plants are still able to produce enough new bicycles to meet the needs of the country and send them to be ridden on the nation's roads. Riding a bicycle has become a new trend. Even those who are accustomed to comfort and leisure, who usually disdain walking, now find pleasure in riding bicycles. In fact, while riding a bicycle may seem less glorious, there is no doubt that it can improve health. Generally speaking, the abrupt prohibition of various car travel has had a good impact on the French people, as it has allowed them to discover the true face of their homeland. Those who are devoted to driving cars often rushed through villages and towns during peacetime. Even if they briefly rested in the countryside, they did not have time to pay attention to the things along the way. Now, sitting upright on bicycles, they look around with fondness and nostalgia, and they are bound to have a different experience, especially when passing through the foothills of mountains. Therefore, the beautiful scenery of the motherland is fully displayed before their eyes, like a newly discovered paradise. Not only that, the popularity of bicycles has also allowed a large number of so-called inventors and mechanized minds to unleash their imaginations to solve the current transportation problems, creating various vehicles of different styles and sizes, showcasing a bizarre and magnificent spectacle. These vehicles are all based on the principle of ordinary bicycles, in other words, they still rely on foot pedals for propulsion, but they are ingeniously designed as tricycles with attached bodies. The problem is that the bodies are too heavy, but being in them can give people the illusion that they are still in the automobile class.

### Shanghai Municipal Council's Maize, Payment and Delivery Today. Rice Shops in Two Concessions Reduce Sale of Foreign Rice by One Day Per Week

Rice shops in the two concessions will reduce the number of days for retail sales of foreign rice by one day per week starting this week. They have also scheduled the first sale of corn on Friday (the 13th). It is learned that the Rice and Grain Office of the Shanghai Municipal Council has notified the rice shops to pay for and take delivery of the goods. They are to collect the sales orders from the Grain Management Committee at No. 703 today, pay at the Rice and Grain Office, and transport the corn. The price per bag is 146.75 yuan. The rice shops sell it at retail, with a limit of half a liter per person, priced at 1.70 yuan in national currency.

Methods for Selling Foreign Rice and Corn

The above corn has all been crushed. After receiving it, the rice shops will universally sell it on Friday (the 13th). As for the sales dates of foreign rice, starting this week, due to the sale of corn, the number of days will be reduced by one day per week, scheduled for Monday, Wednesday, and Saturday. The limit is still one liter per person, priced at 1.70 yuan in national currency. The rice selling points of the Shanghai Municipal Council on Gordon Road, Fair Road, and Huasheng Road will also switch to selling broken rice on Monday, Wednesday, and Saturday, and selling corn on Friday.

Mixed Cooking Similar to Eating Rice

The corn sold by the Shanghai Municipal Council this time is not ground into fine powder, nor is it coarse powder. It is only crushed into granules, equal in size to foreign rice. Its purpose is to make it easy to mix with foreign rice for cooking. It is found that the use of corn as a food staple has long been practiced automatically by the people in eastern Zhejiang and northern Jiangsu to save food and reduce living expenses. Although this is the first trial in this port, it is naturally economical and practical for the public to eat.

The Swiss Chargé d'Affaires and Consul General in Shanghai, Fan Qienai, spoke to the press in Shanghai the day before yesterday, stating that he does not expect the exchange of government officials, Red Cross personnel, and journalists between the Japanese and US governments to be realized quickly. However, there are concrete suggestions from Tokyo and Washington to exchange Japanese and US residents. This plan is being secretly considered by the governments involved.

Strict Exchange of Japanese and American People

After the exchange of government officials between Japan and the United States is successful, the US government hopes to make a similar concrete plan to withdraw certain types of American people who do not belong to government officials. However, this matter depends on whether the Japanese and US governments can reach coordination. However, this type of agreement must be based on reciprocal exchange. The number of Americans residing in Japan and China is limited to the number of Japanese residing in the United States of a similar type. It is found that there are currently about 1,600 US citizens, about 7-800 British citizens, and about 200 Dutch citizens under the protection of the Swiss Consul General.

Received Instructions to Handle Registration

At present, the Swiss Consulate General does not contact or try to maintain contact with the people of countries at war with Japan in Shanghai. It is learned that the exchange of British and Dutch people has not yet been negotiated, but relevant plans are being prepared. The exchange of enemy people currently being negotiated is limited to Japanese and American people. The Trusteeship Department established by the Swiss Consulate General to manage the interests of the American people has received instructions on the withdrawal of enemy people. Therefore, it notifies the American residents belonging to the specified categories to register at the office of the department on the 8th floor of the French Post Office Building at No. 9, French Bund, telephone 88766.

Two Brazilian Ships Assigned for Transportation

The Swiss Consulate General will also review American residents who are not permanently residing here but wish to be included in the exchange. These American citizens should belong to the additional exchange agreement. If they wish to apply for withdrawal, they must register at the American Residents Association on the 7th floor of the Dalei Shipping Company Building at No. 51, Guangdong Road, telephone 15306. As for transportation, it is learned that two Brazilian ships have left South America and will be used to withdraw Japanese and American residents. Those whose names are on the special list of withdrawals should board the ship within the specified time. This matter must first be agreed upon by the governments involved.

### Fang Xiaxian Kidnapped and Murdered, Body Not Yet Identified, Most of the Kidnappers Arrested, Head in Flight, Re-determination Scheduled after Body Identified

Between July 25th two years ago, Chen Linsheng, a wealthy businessman residing on Xinjiapo Road, was kidnapped by bandits and hidden at a certain number on Jing'an Temple Road. A huge ransom was demanded for his release. In this case, two criminals were arrested by the police station in charge and dealt with according to law. However, the leader and the main criminals who carried out the kidnapping were never caught. At the same time, these people kidnapped another wealthy businessman named Fang Xiaxian, a native of Suzhou, and demanded a huge ransom, which was not granted. As a result, the hostage Fang was killed.

Body Abandoned in the Wilderness

Later, the police station found a similar body, but the face was blurred and severely decomposed, and it could not be determined that it was Fang's body. The principal criminals were not caught, and there was no way to prove it. The main criminal in the case, Rui Jinbiao from Yancheng, Wang Zhong, and accomplices Sun Zhirong, Wang Chengyu, Huang Jinming, Zhou Guangshang, and eight others were arrested between January 25th of this year by Chinese Detective Wang Chengying, Detective Supervisor Xu Decheng, Gao Huixian, and Lu Gendi of the Gordon Road Police Station based on secret reports from Yancheng, Menggen Road, Kade Road, and the Chinese界, and confessed

That the Leader of this Case

Named Liu Shilong and Zhang Guocheng, were both at large, having fled far away, and there was no way to catch them for the time being. However, it was found that after both Chen and Fang were kidnapped, they were hidden at No. 14, Jisi Feier Road (属华界), which was the home of the defendant Wang Zhong. A letter was sent to the families of the victims, demanding a ransom. As a result, Chen Linsheng's family paid 400,000 yuan to release Chen. In addition to Liu Shilong and Zhang Guocheng, Rui Jinbiao and Wang Zhong each received 8,000 yuan in legal tender. The police station filed a public prosecution according to the criminal law. Recently, Fang Xiaxian's wife, Ms. Mai Chen, came to Shanghai from Suzhou. The police station recently escorted the one thousand defendants to court. According to the lawyer representing the Shanghai Municipal Council, and according to the claims of Fang Chen, the mouth of her husband Xiaxian contained two gold teeth, which could be vaguely recognized. The police station has not yet determined whether the corpse found has those gold teeth in the mouth. As the case cannot be concluded and sentenced, a re-determination of the truth about the corpse is scheduled.

### Book and Painting Market Has Developed Abnormally in Recent Years, Permanent Exhibitions and Sales are Very Prosperous, Suzhou and Yangzhou Mounting Have Their Own Specialties

Shanghai is a gathering place for national culture and industry. Elegant businesses related to culture, such as epigraphy, calligraphy, and mounting, are also quite developed. The following is a brief description of the general situation of the elegant businesses in this port, as learned from visits.

Special Mounting of Ancient Paintings, Washing and Restoring as New

There are approximately one hundred mounting shops in this port, divided into Suzhou and Yangzhou factions. Among them, about twenty or so have excellent techniques and large scale. There are approximately one thousand mounting workers, with the highest wages around four to five hundred yuan, and the lowest around one hundred yuan. The Suzhou faction is most famous for Liu Dingzhi Mounting Shop, specializing in mounting Song and Yuan works of collectors and ancient books that are severely damaged. The highest mounting price is around one thousand yuan, and the lowest is tens to hundreds of yuan, which is the price list for special mounting of ancient paintings, not including ordinary cases. Whether it is silk or paper, even if it is broken into small pieces the size of a fly's head, the shop can re-mount it seamlessly, making it complete and like new. The Yangzhou faction collects both ancient and modern mountings, and specializes in washing and restoring old books and paintings. After washing and re-mounting, they are brand new, and the colors do not fade, and the antique flavor is not lost. In the Yangzhou faction, Juxingxiang Mounting Shop has a mounting worker named Ma, whose technique is extremely good. Recently, he cut a long landscape scroll written by the famous painter Wu into hundreds of pieces and pieced them together into four landscape hall strips. After repeated inspection by people, it is absolutely impossible to see that they were cut and mounted. It is truly ingenious and miraculous. Unfortunately, this person passed away a few days ago. As for the mounting work, it is slightly similar to the Suzhou faction. The calligraphy and paintings mounted by other mounting shops are also exceptionally beautiful, and the mounting costs are quite low. In short, the Suzhou and Yangzhou mounting workers have their own specialties and are praised by customers. In addition, various fan shops also do mounting, specializing in mounting ordinary paintings. Since the August 13th Incident, the business of various mounting shops has been excellent. The highest annual operating income is around forty to fifty thousand yuan, and others also have several thousand to ten thousand yuan. Recently, due to the high prices of everything, the main materials used for mounting, such as thread, silk, brocade paper, pulp, and paste, have all skyrocketed in price. Mountings shops had no choice but to raise mounting prices, by about seven to eight times. For example, mounting a pair of couplets used to cost two yuan in legal tender, but now it costs eighteen yuan. Although the price has risen, the business of mounting shops is still very prosperous, which shows the enthusiasm of the people for playing with calligraphy and painting after the war. As for the calligraphy and painting engraving business, in the past, those who purchased calligraphy and paintings by contemporary people were mostly literati and elegant scholars, and there were also those who specialized in collecting ancient paintings for profit. Since the August 13th Incident, Shanghai's industry and commerce have developed abnormally, and merchants have gained huge profits and lived a comfortable life. Many also like to indulge in elegance, make friends with literati, and pay high prices to solicit calligraphy and paintings by celebrities to hang in their halls as a glory. Even if they spend thousands of gold, they are not stingy. There are also many foreigners who like Chinese calligraphy and painting very much, and there are many who purchase and collect them. Therefore, the sales of calligraphy and paintings by calligraphers and painters have suddenly widened, and the marked prices have also been several times higher than before the war. In recent years, calligraphy and painting exhibitions have been publicly exhibited and sold, such as a certain painting gallery, which has calligraphy and painting exhibitions all year round, with thousands of visitors every day, and the operating income is huge. This time can be said to be the best period for the calligraphy and painting business. In Shanghai, the works of calligraphers Tan Zekai and Chu Deyi, and painters Wu Daiqiu, Feng Chaoran, female painter Li Qiujun, and Zhu Yongzhao are most praised. The remuneration of famous painters is about 100 yuan per foot, and if it is green and blue, the remuneration is doubled. The value cannot be said to be not expensive, but those who seek it still come in droves. Some people specialize in selling fake calligraphy and paintings by celebrities. If the purchaser is not an expert, it is easy to be fooled. Before, someone spent hundreds of yuan at an exhibition to purchase a landscape painting by a famous painter, but after taking it home and asking an expert to appraise it, they realized that it was not their genuine work. They negotiated with the seller, and the result is unknown. Although name chops are not necessary, people from all walks of life must prepare a chop for application. There are various schools of chop carving. Recently, people in society have liked the Song and Yuan schools and Han seals. There are not many famous epigraphers in Shanghai, with Chen Julai who carves Song and Yuan, Zhao Shuju who carves Han seals, and Wang Fuan of the Zhejiang school being the most outstanding. The chops used by collectors and calligraphers and painters are mostly carved by the three. Tao Shoubo and Wang Kailin are both up-and-coming stars. There are approximately two hundred chop carving shops in Shanghai that also do printing. Among them, the chops carved and printed by the Xinshijie Chop Carving Shop and Lengxiang Pavilion are elegant and without vulgarity. Recently, due to inconvenient transportation, the sources of various stone chops, such as chicken blood stone, Tian stone, Qingtian stone, and Shoushan stone, have been cut off. The ones in circulation now are all inventories. Things are valued because they are rare, so the value has soared. A chicken blood stone that is two inches high and one inch square can be worth five to six thousand yuan, Tian stone is about five hundred yuan per tael, and ivory chops are about twenty yuan per tael. Famous stone chops are not easy to buy. The business of each chop carving shop is relatively stable. Since the outbreak of the Pacific War, the situation in the concession has changed, and various industries are in recession, and the elegant business cannot be avoided. It is now saving expenses to get through the difficult times.

### Recent Developments in Sino-French Cultural Exchange

In the preface to his "The Spirit of the Chinese People" (originally titled "The Spirit of China" in Western text), Gu Hongming said that the French are the most capable of understanding the Chinese. He believed that while the French are not as profound as the Germans, as broad as the American spirit, or as simple as the British spirit, the French possess a delicate and wonderful spirit that the British, Germans, and Americans do not have, and this delicate and wonderful spirit is the primary requirement for understanding China.

From the perspective of French civilization, from literature and art to food and love, it is indeed as Gu said, the delicate and wonderful qualities it possesses are by no means comparable to those of the British, Germans, or Americans. And the civilization refined by China over four thousand years, except for those who fundamentally cannot understand China or deliberately denigrate it, will always make people have to acknowledge the exquisite beauty of China.

A noble and exquisite civilization can only be deeply understood by an equally noble and exquisite spirit. This is like the friendship between individuals, the harmony of emotions, the communion of hearts, which cannot be brought about by all forms or forced by any single force. According to Gu's theory, the friendship between China and France can be said to be an inspiration of the spirit.

In the past century, old France, with the exception of so-called colonials, has indeed been quite close to China, eager to understand Chinese civilization, and quite enthusiastic about the communication of Sino-French culture. However, the French differ from the British, Americans, and Germans in that they do not brag about their work, but simply bury their heads and do it silently. When it is done, it is over, without showing off. Since France's defeat in this war, the French attitude towards work has become even more so. Senior French expatriates in the Far East are still continuing to work to communicate Sino-French culture as usual. Recently, French intellectuals in Beijing and Shanghai held a cultural banquet in Shanghai, and Chinese cultural figures also participated. It is known from reports that the French-Chinese dictionary has been edited by the faculty of the Beijing Kongde Middle School to the letter P. When it is printed, it will be a three-volume behemoth. As for the Chinese-French dictionary, there is the Shanghai Dictionary by Father Puhl, whose draft is almost complete. Dictionaries are originally the primary tool for communicating culture, but the motivation for editing a dictionary is only valuable if it is to communicate culture. The motive for compiling the dictionaries by Kongde and Father Puhl is naturally the purest, and its success is undoubtedly. In addition to dictionary work, they also pay attention to the local cultures of Beijing and Shanghai, which will also be explored in depth. Although it is an ordinary banquet, it has great power to promote Sino-French culture and friendship.

Luban Road has almost become the center of Sino-French cultural communication in Shanghai. There is a Catholic church, large and small schools, libraries, museums, hospitals, sports fields, and parks. It can be said that all the institutions for communicating Sino-French culture are gathered there. The Grand Auditorium of Aurora University holds various exhibitions from time to time, which naturally contributes greatly to the popularization of academics. Soon, the Aurora Museum will hold an exhibition on Chinese medicine. It is said that it will display various magic medicines that have always been said to be able to prolong life after eating. People who hope to live long, please pay attention to the opening date of the exhibition! (Licorice)

### Local Commerce - Prospects for Partial Recovery, Significant Impact of War, Difficulty in Recovering Prosperity, Problems Remain in Restoring Southeast Asian Trade

Three months have passed in the blink of an eye since the outbreak of the Pacific War.  Shanghai's port has been significantly affected by the war.  The port's import and export trade and shipping, except for a few Japanese ships, have almost completely ground to a halt. Although the customs authorities no longer publish these statistics, it is estimated that they are far below pre-war levels.

Industrial production has also been greatly reduced compared to before. Most of the surplus assets and properties have been frozen. Not only have the businesses of the Allied nations been shut down due to the war, but countless Chinese enterprises have also ceased operations, and hundreds of thousands of Chinese have become unemployed. However, most merchants are adopting a wait-and-see attitude, unwilling to abandon their businesses hastily. With the smooth passage through the Chinese New Year season and the partial release of stockpiled goods, Shanghai's commerce seems to be gradually becoming more optimistic.

Currently, prices, except for some controlled goods, continue to trend upward. The weakening purchasing power of the legal tender and the abundance of idle capital have lured speculators to take advantage of the situation, hoarding goods, trading foreign currencies, or scrambling to purchase daily necessities. However, according to Japanese economic policy, any speculation should be suppressed. Therefore, speculative activities may be subject to strict restrictions or complete bans, which remains to be seen. We shall wait and see.

In the coming months, the situation of Shanghai's commerce is unlikely to undergo significant changes. The position of the legal tender has not been shaken, and public anxieties are not based on facts. It is expected that, at least for a considerable period of time in the future, the legal tender will continue to be the main medium of exchange in Shanghai. There is hope for the early restoration of Southeast Asian trade. However, whether non-Japanese private businesses will be allowed to take a share, and whether sufficient shipping tonnage can be obtained, are major questions.

In summary, Shanghai's commerce can still hope to achieve partial recovery under Japanese wartime control. However, achieving pre-war prosperity is no longer realistic. A substantial amount of idle capital should be properly utilized and transferred to the interior for investment in legitimate businesses. As for the food problem, the authorities have already taken appropriate measures, and there is no cause for concern in the short term. However, residents who do not need to stay in Shanghai should leave for their hometowns as soon as possible and avoid lingering, so as to cooperate with the authorities and align with the intention of dispersing the population.

### Seeking Treatment for "Esophageal Cancer"

My father had black stools and was physically weak in June of last year. After diagnosis by a traditional Chinese medicine practitioner, it was determined to be "stomach bleeding." He took about 40 to 50 doses of medicine before recovering. However, he experienced chest tightness when eating, often leading to vomiting. From the end of last year, he vomited water after drinking it, and food after eating it. He went to Shilong Hospital, where an X-ray revealed "esophageal cancer" (known as "ge zheng" in traditional Chinese medicine). The hospital referred him to the Sino-Belgian Radium Therapy Institute, where another X-ray was taken. According to the director of the institute, "The disease is severe and cannot be treated." After returning home, he suddenly was able to drink milk, eggs, and other liquids for about ten days, but his bowel movements were not entirely smooth. Since the thirteenth day of the first lunar month, his condition has reverted to the previous state, unable to ingest food or water. I hereby seek Chinese and Western medical practitioners who can treat my father. I will reward them handsomely. Feng Shixin, "Dahua Firm," 190 Tianjin Road.

### Cigarette Price Controls

Cigarettes are consumables, and it is best not to smoke. However, all kinds of daily necessities have price controls, but cigarettes have not yet been controlled. It is truly necessary for the authorities to implement price controls. The other night, I passed through Henan Road and wanted to buy a pack of twenty Consul brand cigarettes. The prices at two tobacco shops differed by as much as fifty cents for an item that should only cost two yuan, which further proves the urgency of implementing price controls. However, if price controls are implemented and tobacco shops are found hoarding goods and refusing to sell them, it is hoped that the measures for dealing with this will also be stipulated.

### Someone Forcibly Selling Door Numbers

Two people suddenly came to our factory this afternoon, holding door numbers and forcibly selling them, one for each household, at two yuan each. After thinking about it, this is indeed a fraudulent act. To advise citizens to be cautious, I request a small space in your newspaper to prevent citizens from making unnecessary losses. Tang Zhida, Xinghua Printing Factory.

Free Eye Drops.  The owner of the Broadway Liyuan Ticket Office downstairs in Rixin Building on Nanjing Road, due to understanding the suffering of those with eye diseases, has specially made a type of eye drops, which he is giving away to all sectors of society, without charging a single penny. Over the years, countless people with eye diseases have been cured. He is now continuing to give them away. Those with eye diseases, please request them from the ticket office.

### Jumping Off a Building Due to Economic Pressure

Wang Keyou, a local resident, 64 years old, was residing at his relative's home at No. 62 Carter Road, Kade Road. Due to economic pressure, he suddenly had thoughts of ending his life. At around 7 p.m. yesterday, he went alone to the Paradise on the Nanjing Road Sincere Company building and jumped to his death, falling onto Tianjin Road. His skull was shattered, and brain matter flowed out. He was barely alive. Chinese constables No. 118 sent him to Renji Hospital for treatment. It is said that his life is in danger.

### The Ninth Issue of "Small Crafts" Published

The ninth issue of "Small Crafts" monthly magazine has been published, containing the manufacturing methods for eight items, including "Artificial Essences," "Candles," "Vinegar," "Versatile Skin Disease Medication," "Economic Brooder," "Printing Machine," "Airplane Model Toy," and "Seeds." The retail price is 70 cents. It is sold at all newsstands. Send a letter with 70 cents in stamps to the "Small Crafts" Monthly Magazine Office, Xinzha Road, and a copy will be sent to you.

### Good Deeds Bring Abundant Blessings

A Word of Praise - Starting from the Request for Donations for the New Public Nursery

In recent days, I have seen the New Public Nursery's appeal for donations. Indeed, the New Public Nursery in Shanghai's charitable undertakings is one of the most historical and comprehensive places for the elderly, weak, disabled, where the living are cared for, and the sick are supported. This makes one think of the greatness of the founder, Lu Bohong's work.

The Public Nursery is named "New," indicating that there was a similar charitable organization in the past. However, the old charitable organizations, after being run in turns by several prominent gentlemen, often became nominal and ineffective, highlighting the necessity of the "new" spirit.

If you have visited the New Public Nursery, you will surely have a sense of appreciation and reflect on the difficulty of its establishment. Although it is rich in religious - Catholic - colors, it is also a necessary fact; because it was founded by Catholics, and it is also run by Catholics internally. Without the Catholic nuns running this large and complex organization, it would not be possible to manage it so orderly and maintain it to this day. Therefore, we should not have any discrimination based on religious concepts. Moreover, the characteristic of Chinese people is that they can believe in each religion according to their personal beliefs, and they never impose restrictions or jealousy, possessing the magnanimity of "treating everyone equally."

The New Public Nursery's buildings are very solid, with most of the bricks being Chu city bricks, which were used during its construction when the city was being demolished. Moreover, with the planning of several foreign female monks, it has a European feel, with flourishing flowers and trees, and magnificent buildings. The poor compatriots, arriving at this place, are truly in what may be called paradise. However, the difficulty of the New Public Nursery lies in this, in order to accept all and embrace everything, orphans, abandoned babies, and the sick without anyone to turn to, are cared for as much as possible, so the more people are cared for, the greater the expenses incurred. In normal times, there is a subsidy from the local municipal authorities, and with Lu Bohong's enthusiastic planning and coordination in managing charitable undertakings, although there are annual deficits, they are still able to cope. At the end of the year when summarizing accounts, Lu Bohong would take a thick donation book and go to several large companies and foreign firms, immediately raising huge sums of money and clearing a large number of owed store accounts. Lu Bohong had the spirit of enduring humiliation and Paramita for raising donations for charitable undertakings. It is said that once he went to a foreign firm to raise donations and was rejected, but Bohong stood outside the room and did not leave for a long time. When the manager of the firm came out and saw him, he felt that he could not be too disrespectful to this enthusiastic philanthropist and finally made a donation. Many people also asked Lu Bohong why he did not manage more private property. He said confidently, "My greatest assets are the New Public Nursery and the Sacred Heart Hospital." This shows that he was selfless and dedicated his life to relief work.

However, his shortcoming was also that he used himself as an example, emphasizing the human aspect and lacking in the aspect of matters. He did not think it was very important how to organize and how to last. He thought that as long as the work was done well, he would not be afraid of not having funds. Although it is correct, this spirit can be used for temporary emergency relief, but if applied to long-term relief work, without a reliable source of income as a basis, then panic will occur under special circumstances. Of course, even having a foundation is not necessarily reliable, but it is better than not having one. Bohong gradually realized this later and thought about raising a large fund as a basis for the several undertakings he founded, but it all went to waste like cannons fired into the Huangpu River! Fortunately, the mothers in charge internally are willing to endure all kinds of hardships and are finally able to maintain it to this day, otherwise, the greatest asset left by Lu Bohong would have long been bankrupt.

It is difficult to start an undertaking, and it is not easy to maintain it. The New Public Nursery, a charitable organization of considerable size in China—not just in Shanghai—cannot bear to sit idly by and watch it decline without lending a hand. The lives of Shanghai people are difficult today, but the spirit of Shanghai people "being unwilling to lag behind others in doing good" is still being promoted and is active in all levels of society. I am not lobbying for the New Public Nursery, but I think it is my duty to tell the public what I know.

The New Public Nursery has its own value of existence; helping the New Public Nursery to overcome this difficult hurdle, so that it can further promote its spirit of undertaking in the future, will make the cause planted by all of you today, and the fruits reaped in the future, even greater. The ancient saying goes, "Doing good brings a hundred blessings," I would like to use this wish to bless the benevolent people of society.

### A Stroll in Lavinna Park

— Ji Ke

### The French Concession Opens a New Open Space to Commemorate Warriors Who Uphold Justice

Spring in Shanghai in the 31st year of the Republic of China [1942] is a rainy season. Days of continuous rain make it impossible to see a glimmer of bright sunshine. It is truly suffocating. The men and women confined to this corner of the city, which has lost its urban prosperity, are suffocating and unable to breathe a breath of fresh air. Many citizens who are struggling under the burden of life need a free place to go and hope to have a chance to rest. In view of this, the French Concession municipal authorities have specially opened a free space in the heart of the city, which is the newly completed Lavinna Park. It stands with Gujiazhai Park—commonly known as French Park—and Petain Park, adorning the beautiful scenery of the city.

Lavigna Park is located north of Avenue Joffre in the French Concession, west of Avenue Albert, south of Rue Henri, and east of Route L'Aurore. The park is named in memory of a French citizen who died for his country in the Second World War. He was a staff member of the former French Consulate General in Shanghai, surnamed Lavinna De Ravinel, named Yves. On June 20, 1940, he died in battle on the fields of Champagne defending his homeland. The Shanghai French Concession authorities chose his surname as the name of the park to recognize the immortal glory of this warrior who sacrificed himself to uphold justice.

The site of the new park has shared the fate of Shanghai and retains many traces of history. As long as they are not forgetful, Shanghai people should still be able to recall that more than a decade ago, this was originally a large private garden, with an old red brick Western-style house in the garden. Soon, it was purchased by the French Municipal Council, originally intended to build a new building. Due to tight funding, the garden gradually became a plain overgrown with thorns. During the January 28th Incident, the old building was once used as barracks for Vietnamese soldiers, and the abandoned garden was turned into a drill ground. During the August 13th Incident, it was used as a public kitchen for refugees and a family dormitory for telephone company employees. When the Chinese army withdrew from Nanshi, it was also used as a shelter. Finally, it became a storage yard for the Public Works Department of the French Municipal Council. The once magnificent garden had undergone several changes and eventually became desolate, becoming a storage place for stones and coal.

In the spring of the 31st year, Shanghai has changed to another scene. The gentlemen and ladies of the automobile class, who used to speed through the South European-style Avenue Joffre, must now walk like the working masses. Everyone has plenty of time to browse the scenery on the road. When they walk west along Avenue Albert, they will be surprised to find a brand-new garden like a miracle in a fairy tale suddenly appearing before their eyes. The broken bamboos blown down by the wind and rain do not know where they have flown to. At present, only a green evergreen hedge can be seen. A pair of granite lions sit majestically at the gate. Under the rows of trees, there are two paths paved with red gravel, which is said to have been crushed from the red bricks removed from the old building. The path leads directly to a pavilion covered with painted jade-green tiles, which is the site of the old building. There are stone archways, stone benches, and several stone lions in the garden, all donated by private individuals for public enjoyment.

The most striking sight in the park

is the red gravel on the paths. Although the weather is still cold and frosty, and the branches are bare everywhere, only the bright red gravel catches the eye, as if one is in a cluster of flowers where hundreds of flowers have already bloomed.

Braving the misty spring rain, I occasionally strolled for a moment in Lavigna Park. The surroundings are silent. The park is only a few hundred steps away from the noisy Avenue Joffre, and one already has the feeling of being far away from the city. In my imagination, waiting for summer, the park will be shaded by green trees, complementing the red gravel on the paths, which will be particularly pleasing to the eye. If, in the season of clear skies, the warm light of the white sun shines through the turquoise sky onto this path of red, wouldn't it be a natural picture worth moving? I can't help but be fascinated by it.

### The Municipal Council Does Its Best to Issue "Return Home Permits", Office Open as Usual on Sundays

The Municipal Council's "Return Home Permit" office continues to issue permits and half-price certificates to citizens returning to their hometowns from Shanghai. Although yesterday was Sunday, the office remained open as usual, and the number of people going to collect permits did not decrease because of Sunday. In addition, the Wanjilin, which was recently docked for repairs, left the dock yesterday and sailed to Ningbo today, taking 500 passengers evacuating from Shanghai to Ningbo.

Yesterday's newspaper was broadcast at 6:50 p.m.

### Good News for Football Fans: Feng Jingxiang is Coming to Shanghai, Li Huitang's Whereabouts in Hong Kong are Unknown

Feng Jingxiang, one of the famous "Four Knights" of Chinese football, a center forward from the Hong Kong South China Athletic Association and Star Island Athletic Association, and who was also selected as a representative to the Berlin Olympics and the National Games, Meng Yiliang and Wu Qixiang, former center backs from the Lido Athletic Association, who played for Star Island and Eastern Athletic Associations after going to Hong Kong, and Cai Shengsen, a central defender from the Eastern Athletic Association, and others have decided to come north together, and have already arrived in Guangzhou, waiting for a ship to depart. The thousands of football fans at sea were delighted to hear this news. It is understood that the travel expenses for the "Four Knights" to come to Shanghai were telegraphed to the Jinmen Hotel in Guangzhou yesterday morning by Mr. Wang Ruilong, president of the Ruilong Sports Association in this city, amounting to 1,500 yuan in legal tender. This amount was remitted to the Guangzhou branch by a large business in this city, so the money could be exchanged that night. According to current transportation, the sea voyage will take about five days. Last night, we received a telegram from Cai Shengsen reporting that they could depart on Monday (today) or Tuesday (tomorrow) morning. Therefore, it is expected that the "Four Knights" will arrive in Shanghai at the end of this week. If the sea journey is smooth and not obstructed by waves, they will be able to meet the long-separated football fans at sea in the stadium this Saturday. According to another report, although there are reports that the world-famous "King of Football" Li Huitang left Hong Kong to take refuge in the mainland when Hong Kong Island fell, there is still no definite information about his whereabouts to this day.

Spring and Autumn

### Those Who Have Been Through It Count Them One by One

— Yuan Su Hui

Having bad habits eventually leads to "a lifetime of consequences." Gambling is also a well-documented practice that has been around for a long time. The elegant titles bestowed upon gamblers, such as "gambling addict," "gambling ghost," "gambling expert," and "gambling master," show the depth of their involvement and the seniority of their status.

Occasionally, during auspicious holidays, when the mood strikes, playing a game or two, temporarily hiding in dice and forgetting one's mood, is also a last resort. In short, it's just "entertainment" and nothing more. This is nothing to worry about. The side effects it produces are merely like a cup of coffee or a cigar. Temporary gains and losses are of no great consequence. However, often gambling and attacking it every day, treating it as a shortcut to wealth and starting a business from it is a bit "that." During the Spring Festival, on the occasion of a good day, it is inevitable to socialize in the midst of hard work, just like receiving and giving out lucky money, just to play along. However, some people are particularly enthusiastic during this period, forgetting to eat and sleep. Even after the Lantern Festival, or even Qingming, Summer Solstice, and the Beginning of Autumn, they continue to play. "Playing with things loses one's ambition," but they are also playing with their own spirit and materials, and it is inevitable to be accused of "losing virtue." The consequences are unimaginable.

During the process of gambling, onlookers truly feel sorry for these "professional practitioners." First, they place their bets cautiously and attentively, hoping that their ancestors will bless them. Occasionally winning a prize, they become smug and their ambition expands. Then, winning a big victory, they become dizzy, red-faced, their limbs twitching, and their nerves become extremely tense. Then, suffering a slight setback, they grit their teeth, feeling enmity towards the opponent, as if "sweeping a courtyard." But they know that the dice are not working, and they cannot help but be downcast, wishing that their souls could leave their bodies and be reincarnated into gambling equipment. Finally, they make a desperate bet, losing everything. A sound suddenly rings in their ears, and their face turns ashen. Even if they have a stroke and fall to the ground, they do not care about the sacrifice. If their "Spaudingks" and "Longines" are still there, they will make a comeback, desperately breaking the pot and sinking the boat, throwing everything on the table.

What is the final result? They are left with a single cloth shirt, clean hands and two empty sleeves, and return home dejectedly. If they have given up at this point, then their ancestors are truly blessing them. Otherwise, it is difficult to avoid becoming a martyr of high-stakes gambling.

Some of these things are miserable enough, but they are commonplace and very ordinary: A certain clerk usually liked to gamble and pawned his dining furniture—even his bicycle. Unexpectedly, he lost everything again and finally committed suicide by swallowing corrosive liquid (see the 7th edition of this newspaper). A certain carpenter lost every gambling game, his wages and clothes were pawned, and he was in a state of hunger and cold. So he colluded with his gambling "friends" to rob with a fake pistol and was caught by the police (see the 8th edition of the newspaper)—these are just random examples.

Tang Jieyuan said: "……Begging has no door, abduction has no way, making naked, morning and evening, no degree. That poor grandson, where to meet the Drifting Mother? Let's take the past, one by one, as you count!" It is really what a misery. Although the market situation has made everyone want to "make a quick buck", but the fate of several prominent speculators is mostly like this. Small citizens who want to make a windfall can stop it. The saying goes, "Ill-gotten gains are not rich", it comes in soup and goes in water; even if it does not come, it will also die, Amen!

### Feeling While Reading the Newspaper

— Qin Ren

It is said that putting banknotes in your pocket is the most foolish thing in the world. Robbers want to rob, and one loses one with each use. A wise person sends it to the bank, calculates according to the compound interest method, and after seven years, one has both principal and interest. However, people who save have good patience, but capitalists often "see different things and change their minds." Since the opening of night banks, the opinions of vegetable vendors and maids have also changed (these small-scale operators do not know how to speculate, nor are they able to buy gold bars). Saving is also not the best policy. In fact, banks themselves have their own advantages, but vegetable vendors and maids do not know how to use them. For example, if one deposits a certain amount, one receives a checkbook. The next day, one withdraws the whole amount. If it comes from "trading" with relatives and friends, with only twenty-four hours in between, one does not need to repay interest. And with a checkbook in hand, there are endless uses.

The other day I saw an advertisement for a dance hall. In addition to "waiting for instruction," there was also a line for "guests' attention." "Attention" to what? It is to ask the owner of a lost bank passbook to go to the accounting room to "verify the original." In the past, a young man in a foreign establishment changed a number on a one-yuan passbook and deceived a dance girl of her virginity. This is naturally the most extreme use of bank techniques, but in the end, he was caught and put in jail for several years. The current "passbook awaiting collection," if it is not a gimmick for Miss Li losing her diamond ring, is worth pondering.

In fact, a passbook is indeed more rigid than a check. A check was signed to buy a grey back coat for a dance girl, and it was taken back after only three days because it was a bad check. It is puzzling and pitiful whether this gentleman brought a passbook to the dance hall to show off or to please his "lover." If he withdrew the money to prepare to buy rice tomorrow, but was seized by the desire to have fun and planned to enjoy tonight's happiness, then he is the most foolish bug in the world.

### Public Expectation

— Sun Si

There is a saying in the Old Testament: "There is nothing new under the sun." Therefore, chilblains have never grown on my heels. Last winter, due to the severe cold, I thought nothing new could happen, but I suffered from chilblains. At night, when covered with warmth, the pain and itching were unbearable. Even now, in the spring warmth, they are still in a bad state. I believe in natural healing. For young people with normal health, this is considered a minor ailment in terms of "law." Once the weather warms up and the blood in the heels "thaws," this suffering will naturally subside. I often disdain to resort to any ointments or boric acid salves.

So, I tiptoe around, hobbling from east to west every day. Friends and others find it troublesome. Although the inconvenience is small, it arouses sympathy and pity from those who care. Their advice is quite reasonable: applying medicine will at least lead to a faster recovery than natural healing and can reduce pain. Finally, I felt that in terms of "reason and emotion," one should follow good advice. So, I bought medicine and applied it, and now it is gradually taking effect, and I will recover soon.

From these trivial matters, I have learned that things often have two sides. One side is the strict law, and the other side is the gentle emotion. A hunter catches a yellow sparrow in the forest and puts it in a cage. In terms of legal principles, there is nothing wrong with that, but seeing it chirping sadly in the red-lacquered cage, flapping its wings and jumping around, with no way to escape, in terms of reason and emotion, what crime has the yellow sparrow committed? Why not release it back to the forest? The so-called "law and reason are not contradictory" probably means this.

Many people must be unable to work and unable to maintain their lives for many days because they are in this "difficult" situation. Their anxiety and anticipation may not be understood by those on the other side of the shore. A. Trollope has a novel called "The Voyage to Panama," which contains a saying: "But there are many who suffer the pain of hunger, who, though they work hard, are still not satisfied." In this era, unfortunately, Trollope's words are true. With the continuous increase in the cost of living, there are many who work hard but are still not satisfied, let alone those who cannot work because of "difficulties"?

In terms of reason and emotion, these "difficult" situations, just like chilblains getting better in the spring warmth, have become one of the public's expectations. And it is said that the public will often receive the greatest consideration, so even if the article is short, what harm is there in hoping that it will become a reality?

### Sharing the Same Boat in Storms

— He Jia Zhi

(2) Sorrow and Joy

Wei Cheng politely declined the biscuits and sugar that Guo Fang wanted to give them, but accepted the umbrella that Guo Er wanted to lend him, saying that it could be used as a cane on the muddy road. The boatman on this side was seeing them off from the bow of the boat, and Zhang Shurong was receiving them on the neighboring boat. Wei Cheng first stepped onto the neighboring boat, and then onto the stone-paved pier. For Wei Cheng's landing, the boatman on this side and Zhang Shurong had already turned hostility into friendship.

In the dim morning light, Zhang Shurong originally wanted to send Wei Cheng to Shi De Tang, but Wei Cheng refused, saying, "This is a distance that can be shot with an arrow, what am I afraid of? Even if I fall, it won't be a problem." He stood on the shore and looked back at the boat of the Guo brothers and sisters in the city river. The glass window embedded in the middle cabin was open, and Guo Fang's face was fully visible. Only half of Guo Qi's face flashed out. A red and white handkerchief was waving in the window. Wei Cheng hurriedly raised the umbrella in his hand, waving it up and down several times, echoing the handkerchief from afar.

Wei Cheng dragged his heavy steps, walking a few steps westward, walking under the corridor of a grain store. There was a long bench in the corridor that could not be moved, and the bench was leaning against the river. He sat down by the water. Across the river were more than a dozen bamboo branches and three or four trees that were all in their infancy. The sun was red and large, rising in the clouds. Wei Cheng put both hands into his overcoat pockets, and he knew that he was smiling slightly. He thought that going back was too early, making his mother happily sit up from the bed, or even get out of bed. Although she has recently recovered her health, I cannot let her suddenly change her daily routine. He decided to sit for a quarter of an hour or half an hour before starting home.

On the one hand, he admired the dawn scenery of the cold weather, and on the other hand, he recalled the red and white handkerchief and the green raincoat. He also thought of the Guo Qi Guo Fang grandmother's shortbread. He also thought of Guo Fang's address to him, from Mr. Ye Mister Ye, progressing to Wei Cheng. This not only added more smiles to his face, but even his heart was smiling, as if he was eating something more delicious than shortbread. (17)

### Tea-Picking Song

— Ze Fu

During the Qing Dynasty, there was a custom in Guangdong during the first month of the year to have tea-picking songs. The singers were all children, dressed as tea-picking girls, with twelve or eight people in each team, each carrying a flower basket. There were also two older people, called the team leaders, who held colorful lanterns decorated with hibiscus, jasmine, and other flowers. The tea-picking girls' movements, advances, and retreats were all based on the team leaders. Their bows, lifts, and gestures were extremely charming. The song sung was the "Twelve Months Tea-Picking Song," such as the song for February: "In February, the tea buds sprout, sisters go to pick tea together. Elder sister picks more, younger sister picks less, regardless of how much, return home early." The emotions are sincere and the words are earnest, with the style of ancient ballads. During the Lantern Festival, these song teams would often go to the homes of wealthy families to sing, and the host would give them fruits, coins, and other items (see "Lingnan Miscellany" by Wu Zhenfang of the Qing Dynasty). In addition, there were also teams without team leaders. The baskets carried by the children contained a real lamp covered with red gauze. A large circle was made with scriptures, and the children stepped on it while singing, and the song was the same as before (see "Nanyue Notes" by Li Tiaoyuan of the Qing Dynasty). According to this song, it was most popular during the Kangxi and Qianlong periods, so Wu and Li recorded it this way. In addition, this kind of song was also popular in Guangxi, selecting young and beautiful children to dress up as twelve sisters, carrying flower baskets and singing, which should be of the same origin as Guangdong province. However, Rong County uniquely used men and two women dressed up, singing alternately (see "Rong County Chronicles"), which is a slight variation.

### The Problem Lies in Being Fond of Being a Teacher

— Shen Yi

In the early years, there were only a few tutoring schools in Shanghai, but after the war, they sprang up like mushrooms after rain. In order to learn a foreign language, I also studied there, and studied in several places. Leaving aside the results, the most common phenomenon that caught my attention was "a weasel dragging a chicken, the more it drags, the thinner it gets." When school started, there was a large crowd, but in less than a month, more than half of them had left.

Later, people asked me to tutor them. The experience—disappointment and frustration—given to me by several students in succession told me the reason for "a weasel dragging a chicken." The first student always asked me to correct the homework from school. Later, he honestly asked me to do it for him. This made me feel like I was colluding with the student to cheat, so I declined the teaching position.

Recently, I have obtained several young people who really want to make progress, which made me happy for a while. I carefully examined their level, and then adopted textbooks and gave them individual guidance. The results of the past two months are barely satisfactory. However, only a few have made rapid progress.

Two months of experimentation have indeed made me discover several of their biggest shortcomings: 1. Their interest is strong at first but then fades, and they cannot persevere; 2. Those with poor grades mostly do not know how to use their spare time and keep complaining that they do not have enough time; 3. After being assigned to a class, they find that their level is not high enough, and when they are asked to switch to reading a shallower textbook, their vanity often makes them unwilling to accept it. So I pay attention to the following points: 1. From the beginning, I am anxiously paying attention to their interests, collecting a lot of practical and interesting supplementary teaching materials, and occasionally using some lighthearted language when explaining boring textbooks; 2. I try to teach them my own methods of self-study, and tell them that the time for self-study should be three to five times the time for class; 3. I earnestly explain that if the level is not enough, it is useless to reluctantly drag on, but it will reduce interest and hinder progress.

It is really not easy to "grab" students. This is not to "grab" them for business reasons, because it is indeed disappointing to have students who start and do not finish. If it is for business reasons, then you only need to let them come and go like a revolving lantern. Why bother trying to "grab" them?
