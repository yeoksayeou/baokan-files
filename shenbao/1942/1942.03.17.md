### New Guinea Situation Tense: Australia Great War Brewing, Japanese Forces Advance on Port Moresby, Both Sides Intensify Aerial Activity

Tokyo, 16th (Domei News Agency) - Cabinet Information Bureau Deputy Spokesperson Mr. Hori, when receiving foreign journalists today, was asked about the reaction to Prime Minister Tojo's address in the Diet. Mr. Hori stated that, according to various signs, Australia seems likely to follow in the footsteps of the Dutch East Indies. Mr. Hori also cited newspaper dispatches stating that Australian Army Chief Ford had received instructions to attack Japanese forces. However, the source of this information and the location of the attack were not disclosed. Australians seem not to understand Prime Minister Tojo's intentions, which, if true, is regrettable, he said.

Tokyo, 16th (Haitong News Agency) - Reports have just been received stating that startling military developments will occur in New Guinea in the near future. Japanese forces, having landed in New Guinea, are advancing steadily, seeking to encircle Australian forces. Japanese naval aircraft continue to bomb enemy positions and strafe them with machine guns.

Vichy, 16th (Reuters) - According to reports from Tokyo, Japanese forces in New Guinea are currently traversing the jungle, advancing towards Port Moresby.

Sydney, 16th (Reuters) - It is reported that U.S. forces are currently cooperating in the defense of New Guinea. It is generally believed that the most important factor in the fighting there remains time. Allied forces are available for deployment and are currently being dispatched to reinforce the area. According to military strategists, a large number of aircraft must be assembled over Australia, densely like "a cloud covering," in order to secure the Allied lifeline east of the Australian continent.

Sydney, 16th (Reuters) - According to dispatches from Port Moresby, New Guinea, air combat occurred near Thursday Island last Saturday. It is evident that the scope of aerial combat on the Australian side is very broad. These Japanese bombers, escorted by fighters, may have departed from aircraft carriers, but this seems less likely. Port Moresby was again attacked by Japanese heavy bombers yesterday morning. Yesterday, Sunday, was designated by Prime Minister Curtin as a national day of prayer, and churches everywhere were unusually crowded.

London, 16th (Reuters) - A communiqué issued today by the Australian Air Force stated that Australian aircraft bombed the airfield at Dili, Portuguese Timor, yesterday afternoon. Several islands near New Cape St. George were attacked by Japanese aircraft. Fighters quickly scrambled to intercept. Also, the Japanese aircraft that attacked Port Moresby last Saturday were bombers, their target being an airfield. New Guinea was not attacked by Japanese aircraft fleets at the end of the week.

Sydney, 16th (Reuters) - A dispatch from Port Moresby to the Sydney Morning Herald stated that Japanese aircraft were widely active yesterday. Approximately nine fighters and bombers flew over the Torres Strait. The attack on Port Moresby involved heavy bombers, indicating a gradual increase in Japanese aircraft sorties, apparently in preparation for a large-scale attack.

Allied Forces Rebuild Pacific Fleet

Washington, 15th - Regarding the details of the Java Sea battle announced jointly by Washington and London on the 14th, a U.S. Navy spokesperson expressed the opinion that the Allied nations have now continued to organize a fleet in the Southwest Pacific, preparing for combat. The strength and precise location of this fleet are, of course, military secrets. In Australia and New Zealand, the Allied nations have another fleet under the command of Admiral Leary. The strength of this fleet cannot be announced either.

Canberra, 15th (Reuters) - The Australian Air Force issued a communiqué today stating that it is understood that in the air combat near New Cape St. George on Saturday, our losses included one aircraft destroyed on the ground and one shot down in aerial combat. The pilot of the downed aircraft is unharmed. One of our airmen was injured.

### Situation in the Dutch East Indies

Tokyo, 16th (Haitong News Agency) - The Japanese military authorities in Medan, the capital of Sumatra, have ordered the 4,000 Dutch residents of the city not to leave their homes without permission, except for employees of municipal agencies. The Japanese military authorities have also ordered the destruction of all anti-Japanese, anti-German, and anti-Italian propaganda materials and photographs of the Dutch Queen. The municipal government was taken over by the Japanese military last Friday. Four hundred armed police officers, mostly Malay, are responsible for patrolling the streets of Medan. No Japanese citizens were freed when Medan was occupied, as all Japanese residents of the city had been transported by the Dutch to an unknown destination before the outbreak of hostilities.

Tokyo, 16th (Haitong News Agency) - It has been learned from this source that, at the outbreak of hostilities, the Dutch East Indies authorities detained 500 pro-Japanese Indonesians in a village 36 miles north of Bandung.

Colombo, 16th (Reuters) - According to an announcement made today, Vice-Admiral Layton has been appointed Commander-in-Chief of Ceylon (as announced yesterday by the Colonial Office), effective March 10th. Although Layton holds supreme authority, civil administration remains in the hands of Governor Sir Andrew Caldecott and departmental officials and the State Council, until Layton deems it necessary to intervene.

London, 15th (Havas) - Following the British government's appointment of Vice-Admiral Layton as Commander-in-Chief of Ceylon, Vice-Admiral Layton has become a major figure attracting attention from all quarters. A brief account of his career is provided below. Vice-Admiral Layton is currently 57 years old. He was promoted to Vice-Admiral in 1940.

### Bennett Expresses Dissatisfaction with Malayan Intelligence Department

### Sir Grigg Delivers Speech, Says British Crisis is Grave

London, 15th (Havas) - The newly appointed Secretary of State for War, Sir Grigg, took the opportunity of "Navy Week" to deliver a speech in Berkshire, stating that the crisis we are currently facing is even greater than the one we faced last year. This is obvious. The time has come for the British Empire to strive with all its resources in this decisive battle. The British people all have courage and determination, no less than the Soviet Union. Regarding the fall of Singapore, we should refrain from making hasty judgments about this unfortunate event, as we have not yet received accurate information and do not know exactly what the situation is there.

Stockholm, 16th (Haitong News Agency) - British Under-Secretary of State for War Croft said in Colchester yesterday that the crisis we are facing today is even greater than in July last year. We British must tighten our belts and not blame others. Everyone must be prepared to shoulder more responsibility for the country. Our crisis today is unprecedented, so our determination to resist cannot lag behind that of the Allied nations.

### Washington Newspapers Comment on Java Sea Battle

Washington, 16th (Reuters) - Regarding the officially released details of the Java Sea battle at the end of last month, newspapers yesterday morning published them with large headlines and commentaries, calling it a major defeat for the Allied nations. The Washington Sunday Star wrote that this was Japan's most substantial victory. After this naval battle, Java was utterly defeated, and the reason for this is easy to understand. Furthermore, after this naval battle, the Japanese Navy has gained absolute control in the Southwest Pacific, which is also imaginable. Based on this, the defense of India and Australia will have to rely on air and land forces.

Washington, 15th (Havas) - The Star newspaper published an article today commenting on the setbacks suffered by the Allied navies in the Java Sea, stating that "the victory won by the Japanese Navy this time is truly decisive, because after this naval battle, Java was immediately overrun by Japanese forces. In short, since this naval battle, Japan has gained absolute naval control in the Southwest Pacific. Japan now has every reason to be proud. However, it is undeniable that the Allied joint fleet is inferior to the Japanese in terms of both tonnage and firepower. In short, unless we can surpass the enemy in warships, tanks, aircraft, and artillery one day, we cannot expect the Allied nations to win."

### German and American Envoys to be Exchanged at End of Month

### The Kachin People of Burma (Part 1)

In the northwest corner of Yunnan Province, in a section of undetermined border between China and Britain, the N'Mai Hka River (i.e., the Jiangxinpo) and the Mali Hka River wind their way into Burma. The two rivers converge and flow south into the sea, forming the Irrawaddy River that traverses Burma.

In the area where these two rivers meet, amidst towering mountains and dense forests, lives the strong and combative Kachin (Kaichin) ethnic group. They possess a written language and, relying on memory, pass down their tribal history orally from generation to generation. They can recount their history fluently. If written down, it would surely be an absurd and unbelievable history of Kachin colonization spanning tens of generations. The Kachin people primarily reside in this area, which, while bordering Burma, also has some of their kin scattered in the deep mountains of western Yunnan.

Let's begin with their basic necessities: food, clothing, and shelter. Kachin villages are scattered on high mountains or in dense forests, lacking streets. Houses are scattered and unconnected to prevent fires. The framework of the houses is entirely built with thick tree trunks, and the walls are made of bamboo fences. In these deep mountain forests, these materials are inexhaustible. The living space inside the house is about two or three feet above the ground, supported by wooden frames like a low building. Woven fine bamboo mats are laid on these wooden frames, and people live above while livestock are raised below. The foul air permeates the house, but the Kachin people are unperturbed, not finding it strange at all. Perhaps this is due to familiarity. The exterior of the house extends several feet, like a corridor, under which farm tools are piled, women husk rice, men relax, and it also serves as a shelter for cattle and sheep. From the outside, the house is rectangular, ranging in length from thirty to one hundred feet, depending on the owner's wealth. Such a large house can accommodate several small families—that is, several generations living together under a single family head.

Each house has two doors. It is said that the back door is for ghosts and spirits, so it remains closed year-round. When we visited Kachin residences, we entered through the front door, taking off our shoes and socks, walking barefoot, and climbing a clumsy ladder to step into the bamboo-matted house. The host was very welcoming and hospitable, and we received a very warm reception. The room had no furnishings, only low wooden stools, a few sleeping mats, several bamboo water containers, and incomplete iron pots. These were the decorations of the room. At one end of the house, we saw many hearths lined up. Parents, married sons, and unmarried sons and daughters each occupied a hearth. At night, everyone would lie down fully clothed next to their hearth. There is plenty of wood in the mountains, so they keep a fire burning all night, illuminating the dark corners of the house, but the thick smoke has stained the bamboo walls black.

A rectangular house can only last up to eight years before gradually collapsing. When they deem it uninhabitable, they set the old house on fire and rebuild a new one. They have plenty of manpower and materials, and they are rich in a spirit of cooperation. Once the owner has prepared all the wood, bamboo, and thatch for building a new house, the villagers all pitch in. In a short two days, they can build a brand new dwelling. No one demands wages. When the owner and their family move in, they prepare a lavish feast of wine and meat for everyone to enjoy, which is their reward.

While their living spaces are filthy, the Kachin people's clothing is even more appallingly dirty. Once a garment is put on, they never take it off to wash it. Day and night, it's the same piece of clothing—truly "clothing by day, bedding by night." Unless it becomes extremely tattered and falls off the body, they will never change into a new one. The Kachin people say that there is no water where they live. To fetch water for washing, one must traverse steep cliffs, and even if they obtain a little water, they will always use it as drinking water first.

Rice is their staple food. Apart from a few people who have copper pots and iron woks, most use bamboo tubes. When the bamboo tube is charred, the rice is cooked. They do not use bowls or chopsticks when eating. Instead, they use leaves to divide the cooked rice into several packets, according to the number of people. Without regard to guest or host, old or young, each person is given two packets—no more, no less. This clearly reflects a primitive era of equal distribution. The food inside the rice packets, except for the privileged, is often mixed with yams, beans, wheat, and so on. They do not eat leftover food. What they eat today must be prepared and cooked after waking up this morning.

Some say that Burma is an oriental matriarchal country because women can fight, defend themselves, and remain fearless in danger just like men. In reality, Burmese women have not achieved a special status; rather, they possess the ability to handle matters and work equally with men. Their ingenuity and skill even surpass those of men, so their power has obviously increased with the development of their abilities. Kachin women are no exception. They carry heavy loads on their backs, their bodies bent at a ninety-degree angle, their hands twirling small spindles, humming softly to comfort themselves. They wake up early in the morning to prepare three meals of rice and wheat, then carry long bamboo tubes up the mountain to fetch spring water. After finishing breakfast, they go into the deep forest to gather firewood, carrying large bundles back. They also weave. Two wooden sticks hold the warp threads taut, one tied to a stake in the ground, the other hanging from their own waist. They sit on the ground, straighten their legs, and slightly strain their backs, then slowly throw the shuttle with their hands. This primitive form of work can also weave various lovely patterns.

Young people also fall in love. The hearth inside the house is where they flirt. Parents do not forbid it, and there are opportunities to satisfy sexual desire next to the hearth. Women do not place much emphasis on chastity, but if they have a child, the man must pay a heavy fine. Although love is very free, marriage matters are still decided by the parents. When parents choose a match for their son, the first thing they do is obtain samples of the woman's cloth and handiwork to give to fortune-tellers to calculate if they are compatible. If they are, they secretly send someone to the woman's family to propose marriage and negotiate the bride price. Once both sides are satisfied, the wedding date is immediately set. On the wedding day, the bride sets off for the groom's house, accompanied by several female companions, carrying a large basket of dowry. Relatives and friends of the groom's family arrive, and a lavish feast is prepared. The bride climbs the wooden ladder and goes straight to the hall, where her mother-in-law comes out to welcome her and places a ring around her neck, signifying that she has been accepted as a member of the family. Then she meets the groom, and they sit together on a straw mat, drinking from the same cup, taking turns sipping, and smoking the same cigarette, taking turns puffing. Thus, the ceremony is completed.

The Kachin people's characteristic is their strength, combativeness, and determination to avenge any grievance. Revenge is their bounden duty, passed down through generations of grandparents, fathers, and sons. If a blood feud is established, it may take several generations to exact revenge.

### German-Soviet Front: Situation Unchanged, Germans to Launch Large-Scale Offensive in May or June

German Supreme Headquarters, 16th - Huitong News Agency - Today's German military report stated that yesterday, enemy forces on the Kerch Peninsula launched a large-scale attack with multiple armored vehicles, but were ultimately repelled by German and Romanian forces. Soviet casualties were heavy. German fighter and destroyer squadrons destroyed 45 enemy aircraft, with the Germans losing only one aircraft. The 134th Saxon Infantry Division has repeatedly defeated enemy forces in recent weeks, achieving outstanding results. From the 13th to the 15th, Soviet forces on the Kerch Peninsula lost 136 tanks. Soviet forces attacking elsewhere were repelled by the German army after fierce fighting in heavy snow.

Moscow, 16th - Reuters - A semi-official source in Moscow announced today that Soviet forces are continuing to advance on the Southwestern Front (the area of Oryol, Kursk, and Kharkov). It is claimed that Soviet forces broke through German fortifications and recaptured several populated areas, currently facing fierce German resistance and continuing to advance. Soviet troops led by General Gobakov recaptured three large villages, seizing large quantities of ammunition and supplies. Soviet infantry advanced with active tank support. However, the Soviet communiqué at noon only stated that "there were no significant changes on the front last night."

Stockholm, 15th - Havas - The Dagens Nyheter has received a dispatch from its correspondent in Berlin stating that the German army will launch a large-scale offensive on the Eastern Front, likely in May or June. As for the front-line situation, there have been no changes in recent days. Both belligerents are currently preparing for a major battle in the future, so the battle situation is temporarily quiet. At least in the past week, the scope and strength of the Red Army's counterattacks have decreased compared to before, but this does not mean that the Red Army has stopped driving the German army out of its original positions. In fact, in the past few weeks, the Red Army, under the cover of heavy tanks, heavy artillery, and aircraft, attacked a German division a total of 91 times, but ultimately failed each time, retreating to their original positions after suffering heavy losses. Military observers here also said that the Soviet Union still has a large amount of manpower that can be mobilized, but the German army is satisfied with the winter warfare. The Red Army has suffered significant losses and will find it difficult to replenish their forces during the spring offensive. At this time, the Soviet Union's war effort seems to be concentrated on the Crimean Peninsula, especially on the Kerch Peninsula, concentrating a large number of troops in an attempt to break through the German lines in the Isthmus of Feodosia. In the central sector, the Red Army has made some progress in its attack on the city of Yelnaya. As for the Leningrad region in the north, the German army is constantly attacking, attempting to force the Red Army to abandon the west bank of the Volkhov River. Another German force is clearing out remnants of the enemy in the Lyuban district.

Bloody Battle Between German and Soviet Forces on the Kerch Peninsula

Berlin, 15th - Havas - On the 14th of this month, the Red Army once again attacked the German positions on the Kerch Peninsula front. The army attacked in six directions under the cover of eighty tanks, but German aircraft bravely engaged, covering the advance of the army, while constantly bombing enemy tank formations and infantry units. A total of eighty-eight enemy tanks were destroyed on the 13th and 14th. On the same day, the Red Army attacked northeast of the Baktan Zhoulog area under the cover of tank formations, but after fierce hand-to-hand combat with our army in the snow and ice, they were eventually repelled. The enemy lost 19 tanks. By nightfall, the German defense line was still intact.

Berlin, 16th - Huitong News Agency - An authoritative source stated last night that when Soviet forces attacked Kerch on Saturday, more than half of the enemy's tanks were destroyed on the spot. The enemy force consisted of six divisions, covered by eighty tanks, and forty-two of them were destroyed. Battles continued in several locations yesterday. The German Air Force achieved great merit in this battle.

Berlin, 16th - Huitong News Agency - An authoritative source stated last night that Soviet forces in the Degenburg area launched another attack on Saturday. Hand-to-hand combat broke out in several locations. The enemy first bombarded with artillery, followed by an attack under the cover of 15 tanks, but the German and Slovak forces repelled them, destroying 10 of their tanks. The enemy left behind piles of corpses and retreated in defeat.

Donets Battles Conducted in Snow

Berlin, 16th - Huitong News Agency - German forces in the Donets River basin on the Eastern Front crushed the stubbornly resisting Soviet forces in heavy snow, capturing many enemy soldiers and seizing many war materials. On the 13th of this month, a Soviet battalion launched a night attack on the German positions in Mies along the Sea of Azov, but was severely attacked by the German army.

### French Concession Police Department's Measures to Ensure Security Increase in the Number and Duties of "Li Zheng", Identity Cards Issued to All Merchants and Residents in the Concession, Implementation of Terrorist Drills, Hope for Cooperation

According to the French Municipal Council, in order to cope with the needs of the current environment and to ensure the safety of residents within the concession, the French Police Department will implement the following measures in the short term:

Increase in "Li Zheng"

Increase in the number and duties of "Li Zheng": The "Li Zheng" established in 1938 were originally inspectors permanently stationed by the Police Department in various lanes. One of their main duties was to report to the police station those who possessed or traded weapons, sold opium drugs, or opened gambling venues, as well as all other acts that violated public order. The position of "Li Zheng" should, in principle, be drawn from the most respected landlords. There are currently 1,600 "Li Zheng" in the French Concession. Past experience has proven that these "Li Zheng" are of great assistance to administrative police, and because of the establishment of new lanes, the number of "Li Zheng" will be increased and their duties will be expanded.

Issuance of Identity Cards

Identity Cards: The French Police Department will issue identity cards. Everyone should apply for this identity card in order to prove the identity of merchants and residents within the concession and to prevent villains from lingering around.

Terrorist Drills

Terrorist Drills: In order to habituate residents to suppressing terrorism and bandits, and to train residents to automatically assist the police station, terrorist drills will be implemented. During the drills, designated residents in each lane should enthusiastically fulfill the orders they receive and follow the guidance of the police officers, so that their cooperation will be more effective in the event of an incident in the future.

All residents of the French Concession should understand that the above measures are necessary and are related to their own well-being. Therefore, they should cooperate to the best of their ability to maximize the effectiveness of these measures.

### Methods for Reporting Native and Foreign Goods

For re-exported native goods transported by methods other than inland river vessels, in addition to filling out the D5 sub-declaration for statistical purposes, a permit and two copies of the re-export declaration must also be submitted. Foreign goods: The foreign goods duty-paid certificate that has been used in the past should be abolished immediately, and the C-series foreign goods re-export declaration should be used instead. One copy should be filled out when reporting. For re-exported foreign goods transported by inland river vessels, two copies of the re-export declaration should be filled out, and submitted together with the permit and unloading list. Foreign goods and native goods: For goods currently holding sales permits, native goods sales permits, sales sub-permits, and transport declarations, in addition to the names that should be provided as usual, the following sub-declarations for statistical purposes must be filled out: (A) Those holding sales permits and sales sub-permits must also fill out a C3 re-export declaration. (B) Those holding native goods sales permits and transport declarations should fill out D2 and D5 sub-declarations for statistical purposes as needed. The other current reporting procedures for goods transported to the interior will remain the same as before, without any changes.

### Staff Involved in Weight Manipulation During Flat Rice Delivery Arrested, Authorities Attach Great Importance to Thorough Investigation, Overcrowding During Flat Rice Purchase Causes Young Woman to Faint

Datong News Agency reported that when the foreign rice issued by the Shanghai Municipal Council to various rice shops is picked up from the warehouse, each bag has a shortage or surplus in weight. Therefore, the Rice and Grain Management Committee of the Shanghai Municipal Council entrusts a foreign firm to send someone to weigh the rice and record the weight as a third party in order to show fairness. Recently, an incident of manipulation by the weigher occurred. The following is a record of the incident:

Designated to Pick Up Rice from Yuelai Warehouse

On the 5th of this month, the Shanghai Municipal Council's Rice and Grain Management Committee allocated 20 bags of foreign rice to No. 4 branch of Father Lo's Public Welfare Company and designated them to pick up the rice from Yuelai Warehouse at No. 18, Tai'er Road. On the same day, the company sent an employee, Chen Jinkui, to the warehouse to pick up the rice.

Weigher Actually Reduced the Weight

At that time, the Pingzhun Foreign Firm on Beijing Road, which was entrusted by the Shanghai Municipal Council's Rice and Grain Management Committee to handle the weighing, sent two employees, Shen Debiao and others, to handle the weighing at the warehouse. The total weight of the ten bags of rice was 4,016 pounds. The weigher actually reduced the weight to 3,357 pounds on the weighing slip. When the Public Welfare Company employee asked the reason for the reduced weight, the weighers Shen Debiao and others replied that they would be responsible for the weighing slip since it was signed by them. After the company picks up the rice, the price of the excess 659 pounds of foreign rice will be calculated and they will come to the store to collect it.

One of Two Weighers Arrested

Although Chen Jinkui did not approve of the weigher's behavior at that time, the weigher held the authority to weigh the rice and could not be offended. After transporting the rice to the store, he immediately reported the situation to the owner. The company authorities believed that this behavior was completely in violation of the law and reported it to the Shanghai Municipal Council's Rice and Grain Management Committee and the Songshan Road Police Station. Subsequently, the Songshan Road Police Station arrested one person, Shen Debiao. The other weigher had already fled upon hearing the news. After the incident, the Shanghai Municipal Council and the police station attached great importance to it and conducted a thorough investigation to see if this weigher, who claimed to be a notary, had committed similar fraud in the past, and imposed severe punishment to warn others.

Overcrowding During Rice Purchase Causes Woman to Faint

According to inquiries from Datong News Agency reporters, yesterday the Rice and Grain Management Committee continued to issue sales orders specifying the number of bags of corn to various rice shops. The rice shops paid at the Rice and Grain Office with the orders. The quantity allocated was exactly the same as that allocated last Monday. They can pick it up one after another from Lihe Warehouse at No. 195 Suzhou Road starting today to handle retail sales on the 20th (Friday). Yesterday was the day for the rice shops to release foreign rice, and the overcrowding was unprecedented. Even the police could not number and line up the crowds. According to Datong News Agency reporters who witnessed it yesterday morning, a young woman in the line for rice at the Tongchang Rice Shop at the intersection of Yuqiaqing Road (Baik Road) fainted from being overwhelmed. Two Chinese police officers stepped forward to help her up and lifted her body up and down for a long time before she recovered. There were even more cases of women and children being squeezed and injured. This tragic scene is truly pitiful.

### Zhou Sanlang's Bravery is Commendable

The Shanghai Municipal Council Police Department issued a statement that, when Self-Defense Force member Zhou Sanlang was on duty at 7:30 PM on the 14th of this month, he saw four bandits robbing a Portuguese of his property near Jing'an Temple Road and Parker Road. Zhou bravely arrested the bandits and finally captured one bandit near Yuqiaqing Road and recovered 84 yuan of stolen money. Mr. Zhou not only performed his duties to the best of his ability, but also set an example for other Self-Defense Force members. From this, it can be seen that the Police Department's establishment of the Self-Defense Force has great vision. We deeply appreciate the citizens' ability to be brave and public-spirited. It is hoped that other members will follow his example.

### Bandits Caught in the Mainland Apartment on Route Tenant de Puype

The French Police Station's Western Detective Gral (transliteration) and Inspector Micronon received a tip-off the day before yesterday that a large number of bandits were hiding in the Mainland Apartment on Route Tenant de Puype, plotting to commit robberies within the concession. They immediately led detectives Xu Kaixing, Chen Yuntang and others to the apartment. They arrested four Peidong bandits, Shen Jinlong, Jiang A'er, Wang Maogen, and Shao Jintang, in Room 208, and confiscated a pistol and three bullets. Shen and others confessed that there were still accomplices hiding in the back room of No. 13 Wangzhi Road. The detectives then took the bandits there and arrested two more people, Shao Chenggen and Lu Shuxing, and confiscated a six-inch pistol. They were all taken back to the police station. It was learned that the bandits had committed dozens of robbery cases in the two concessions. They were ordered to be detained, investigated for stolen goods, and their accomplices were arrested before being dealt with according to law.

### Swindle by Faking Telegrams

Zhu Jinghe, a woman residing at a certain number in Xinkang Lane, Baik Road, was at home at 2:30 PM on the 11th of this month when a young man knocked on the door and entered. He claimed to be from an American news agency and said that there was a telegram from Chongqing that had to be collected at the Lester School at No. 1320 Avenue Haig with a receipt. He showed a receipt and asked for 26.8 yuan. Zhu paid the amount as requested. When she went to the school to collect the telegram, she realized that she had been cheated. According to the school engineer, Moolick, there have been as many as seven people who have gone to the school to collect telegrams in the past two days. After learning of the above incident, the Police Department hopes that citizens will not be deceived when encountering such incidents and will report to the nearest police station.

### Opium Den Cracked Down in Shangxian Lane, Avenue Joffre

They only found two opium dens and nothing else. They then took the opium offenders and the evidence back to the police station for processing.

### Ningbo Girl Sold Into Prostitution, Two Female Criminals Arrested

Sun A'yue, a Ningbo girl, 29 years old, with a bit of beauty, lived at No. 112, Shengsheng Lane, Qianjiatang, Huanlong Road, French Concession. Recently, due to the rising cost of living, she relied on her mother, Zhu, to make a living by washing clothes, which was not enough to maintain her. Therefore, she asked people everywhere to find her a job. A distant relative, Ding A'lin, accepted the girl's request.

Evil Intentions

He falsely claimed to introduce her to work as a maid. On the afternoon of the 2nd of last month, he lured the girl to the home of Gu Yang, a newspaper vendor (56 years old, from Suzhou), at No. 1, Lanxin Lane, Route Albert, and then took her to Changshu and sold her into a brothel at No. 17, Zhucaobang for 300 yuan, to engage in the life of a goddess. A'yue could not bear the abuse and secretly wrote to her mother on the 25th of last month. Sun Zhu went to Changshu to negotiate in person before she was able to redeem her for a considerable price and bring her back to Shanghai. However, she

Escaped Justice

and felt very unwilling to have been free of Ding A'lin and Gu Yang. She immediately reported the information to the French Police Station. Detective Li Yuyuan and Detective Guo Ruimin, who were handling the case, investigated and confirmed the facts. They arrested Gu Yang. Since Ding had already fled upon hearing the news, they arrested his wife, Ding Chen (40 years old, from Changshu, residing at No. 49, Lane 17, Rue des Soeurs), and took them both to the police station for detention. After the investigation is completed, they will file a public prosecution against the two defendants on the charge of obstructing family happiness.

### American Prisoners of War Detained in Shanghai Can Obtain Necessities, Japanese Side Permits Assistance

The English *China Press* reported that the American Community Association of Shanghai announced yesterday morning that the Japanese military authorities have permitted the delivery of daily necessities to American prisoners of war in the Shanghai area.

### Discussion of Bicycle License Consultation to Follow; Joint Tricycle Licenses; Position of the Public Works Department Regarding the Issuance of Joint Bicycle Licenses Remains Unclear

According to the Shanghai Times, the Public Works Department of the International Settlement and the Chinese authorities are still awaiting a decision from the French Municipal Council regarding the proposed joint bicycle license for the three districts of the city. Competent observers believe that after the bicycle license matter is settled, the three parties will further discuss the possibility of using a joint tricycle license.

The French Municipal Council Has Yet to Express Itself

It is noted that when the proposal for a joint bicycle license was announced, the Chinese authorities and the Public Works Department had already reached a tentative agreement on a trial basis and signed an agreement. However, the use of this license requires the formal consent of the French authorities. Therefore, the matter was discussed with the French authorities. As of now, the French Municipal Council has not clarified its position on this matter, stating only that it is under detailed study.

Decision on Bicycle License Within the Week

However, a semi-official source said yesterday (the 15th) that the decision on the joint license method is expected to be announced this week. According to the proposed joint license method, bicycle owners only need to obtain a license from any one district and do not need to obtain separate licenses in the three districts, as the joint license is valid in the International Settlement, the French Concession, the Western District, or the Chinese area. If all current difficulties are resolved and the joint bicycle license is implemented, the three parties will study the issue of joint tricycle licenses. It is widely believed that this matter is extremely important, as tricycles still need to obtain separate licenses in the three districts, which is not only troublesome but also more costly in terms of license fees compared to the joint license method.

### Military Notes Turn from Weak to Firm; Zhá Chì Drops and Then Rises

Yesterday, the spot Zhá Chì market dropped and then rose, as military notes turned from weak to firm. Because the old and new legal tender had been evened out, people's hearts were soft in the face of uncertainty. Speculative securities firms and Tianjin gangs bought in, and there was no shortage of sellers with high prices and real goods, causing two withdrawals of 18,000 yuan in Customs taels and then a retreat. From the morning, each bar (ten taels) initially suffered from the weakness of the previous Saturday. Under the competition between silver firms and cash firms, the opening was low at 850 yuan, at 17,300 yuan. Because the securities firms vigorously entered the market, it rose to 17,600 yuan. Chengji Shihe and the silver firms rose again, and sold back to 17,300 yuan. Shengyong Securities entered the market, and it was heard that military notes were rising. People's hearts turned better, and retail investors rushed to absorb them. The price actually flew up 750 yuan, breaking out of 18,000 yuan and reaching 18,050 yuan. Hongqing Yongshunyuan vigorously sold, retreating to 17,750 yuan. Tong Kang Yong, Decheng, and Shengyong rose again, reaching 18,250 yuan. Shengyong came out again, and Hesheng and another securities firm sold out. At noon, it retreated to 17,800 yuan. At noon, it closed at 17,950 yuan, a small increase of 200 yuan compared to the previous weekend. There was a difference of 950 yuan in half a day. The transaction was not prosperous. The large Xin Tong Hang of jewelry gold reduced the discount by 50 yuan per tael, hanging at 1,850 yuan, and reduced the intake by 200 yuan. Silver: 20 yuan. The black market selling price was 21 yuan, and the purchase price was within 20 yuan. Silver coins were 10 yuan and 5 cents each.

### Public Debt Loans Can Still Be Done; Stocks are Soft Both East and West

The over-the-counter market for public debt yesterday saw a decline in transactions due to people's hearts being confused. Market prices were still mixed. However, types Ding and Wu were in greater demand. Lemao sold type Jia because of the rush, and the trend was initially stable. Type Bing rose to 7 yuan and 4 cents, and type Wu rose to 5 yuan and 2 cents, not falling due to rumors. It is said that public debt loans can still be done, but they require quite a few acquaintances. It is also heard that people have already gone to Jinhua to receive interest. It is unclear if this is true. Xie Yuanyuan, Xinhua, Tongyi, Renchang, and Lianyi bought in, while Lemao, Hu Heji, Yiji, Yichang, Zhongfu, etc., supplied quite a bit, so market prices rose and fell unevenly. Except for type Jia, which fell by a relatively large amount of 8 cents, the rest fell only slightly by 2 cents. Type Wu rose by 4 cents. The outlook should be stable for a while. The transaction volume was about 300,000 yuan. A brief table is listed below.

Yesterday's foreign stock market continued to decline. A total of 9,500 shares were traded, including Jardine Spinning Mill at 26 yuan and 25 yuan 75 cents, Sino-British at 7 yuan and 1 cent, China Textile at 10 yuan and 3 cents, Jardine Brewery at 6 yuan and 3 cents and 6 yuan and 2 and a half cents, Ken Zhi at 26 yuan 25 cents and 26 yuan, Paper Industry at 6 yuan 4 cents and 6 yuan 3 and a half cents, Telephone at 25 yuan 25 cents, Lei Car at 40 yuan and 39 yuan and a half cents, Electric Power Preference at 99 yuan, Garundan at 8 cents and 6 cents, and Langer Zhi at 14 yuan, all were transaction prices. Others, such as English Union, had a buying price of 20 yuan 25 cents and a selling price of 21 yuan and a half cents. The industry had 17 yuan and 17 yuan and 2 cents, Steel Industry had 12 yuan and a half cents and 13 yuan, Wheelock Marden had 55 yuan and 55 yuan and 5 cents, Shanghai Flannel had 6 yuan 3 cents and 6 yuan 6 cents, British Dazhao had 12 yuan and a half cents and 13 yuan, and Tana Mara had 1 yuan 8 cents and 2 yuan 6 cents, all were buying and selling prices.

Business was 190 yuan, all were transaction prices.

### Burlap Finally Rises

The cloth market was weak in the morning and firm at noon, because actual sales were bleak, and stockholders were distracted, sometimes entering and sometimes exiting. There was a sharp drop at one point in the morning, but the closing price rebounded strongly because military notes rose. As a result, white cloth, coarse cloth, and twill rose by 1 yuan to 2 and a half yuan. Bleached and dyed printed cloth was flat. 16-pound coarse cloth, Shuangxiang brand was 165 yuan, Feihong brand was 137 yuan, 8-pound Zhenzhong coarse cloth was 83 yuan, 9-pound Wufu was 92 yuan, Sanba bleached cloth was 155 yuan, White Cat printed cloth was 120 yuan, White Cat hemp yarn was 145 yuan, 190 Taohua women's muslin was 210 yuan, No. 60 was 182 yuan and a half cents, Butterfly blue cloth was 175 yuan, Changshou plain fu silk was 5 yuan 3 corners and a half cents, Dapeng fine cloth was 134 yuan. More than 400 pieces were transacted on this street.

East cloth: Yesterday's market fell first and then rose, because people's hearts are trending upwards, and it has become easy to rise and difficult to fall. In the morning, the opening price of 12-pound Longtou fine cloth new order was 1656 yuan, falling to 64 yuan. At that time, the buying wind was fierce again, gradually rising to 71 yuan at the close. The market later started to rise from 171 yuan and a half cents to 75 yuan at the close because of the strong appetite of those inside and outside the industry, a sharp increase of 6 yuan per piece compared to last week. Medium-grade brands once fell in the morning, and then followed suit and rose.

### Yarn Market Spins

The cotton yarn market is still in a spinning situation, because people's hearts are mediocre, and military notes are stable. The initial opening price of 20-count Shuangma factory order was 2,900 yuan, falling to 2,815 yuan. Later, due to profits, people patched up, and it gradually rebounded to 2,990 yuan. The closing price was loose again at 2,910 yuan. 42-count Lanfeng was 6,760 yuan to 6,880 yuan, 60-count Xiantao was 13,750 yuan, 60-count Caiqiu was 15,300 yuan, 20-count Yueqin was 3,720 yuan, 20-count Shuiyue was 3,820 yuan, 20-count Tejin Cheng was 2,500 yuan, 20-count Shuangma was 3,300 yuan to 3,400 yuan, 16-count Jinta was 3,260 yuan, 16-count Aircraft was 3,370 yuan, 20-count Lanfeng was 3,880 yuan, 16-count Da was 3,300 yuan, 10-count Fuyan was 1,600 yuan, and 10-count Boy Scout was 2,250 yuan to 2,280 yuan.

### Miscellaneous Grains are Highly Priced and Sell Slowly

Yesterday's miscellaneous grain market has tended to level off and fall, because prices are too high, actual sales have gradually decreased, and there are quite a few people selling at high prices. Therefore, the market for soybeans, red beans, and kidney beans has fallen across the board by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. However, soybean cake is still active and sees an increase of 1 to 2 yuan. A total of more than 200 packages of Tianjin Jinyuan were sold, priced at 220 yuan. One carload of Linhuaiguan soybeans was priced at 209 yuan. More than 100 packages of Nanqiao soybeans were priced at 210 yuan to 200 yuan. Ten packages of Pinghu Du beans were priced at 240 yuan. Fifty packages of Pudong Du beans were priced at 220 yuan. One hundred packages of Wujiang Jianqing were priced at 200 yuan. One hundred and fifty packages of Chongming Sha silkworm were priced at 150 yuan to 145 yuan, and more than 100 packages of Sha red were priced at 220 yuan to 222 yuan. One thousand pieces of Hankou soybean cake were priced at 36 yuan. Eight thousand pieces of Xingji soybean cake, the May stack order price was 48 yuan and a half to 51 yuan, the June stack order was 49 yuan and a half to 52 yuan, the July stack order price was 50 yuan to 52 yuan. One carload of Mingguang red grain was priced at 150 yuan.

Also, the Miscellaneous Grains Group of the Shanghai Rice, Wheat, Miscellaneous Grains, and Oil Cake Association was formally established yesterday. It is heard that the first thing to be done is to dredge the source of soybeans.

The leather market fell first and then rose. Initially, it fell by 3 to 5 yuan due to sluggish actual sales and floating households selling. Later, because wealthy households came to absorb them again, the market regained strength. As a result, it rose by about 2 yuan compared to the previous day. A total of more than 4,000 packages of Sanxin large package bran were sold, priced at 99 yuan to 105 yuan, and small package bran was 107 yuan, and orchid bran was 105 yuan.

### It's Even Harder to Buy Rice

Since the ban on the transport of national rice into the concession, the burden has stopped, and the rice stores have also closed their doors. Those who sell sell at 4 yuan and 8 cents per liter, still thinking it's a rare commodity. And there are treacherous rice stores that sold foreign rice yesterday, hard currency. Most people, because they did not receive notice in advance, temporarily wrote down the numbers and were forced to withdraw. However, most rice stores do not have this prank. The French Concession sells for about 400 yuan. The area west of Shanghai is cheaper because it is close to the suburbs, at 33 yuan per liter. The rice stores and miscellaneous grain shops, which are suffering the bitter situation of the Japanese, have all raised their inventory by more than double in a few days. There is no joy in the huge profits. It is no wonder that people covet it.

### Sugar Prices and Sugar Stocks Ease

20% of the Sugar Payment Can Be Paid in National Currency

Recently, the sugar market has gradually fallen in price because military notes have eased slightly, about 20 to 30 yuan. At the same time, the sugar stocks of the cooperative have also softened, such as the coarse sand stock at 245 yuan to 47 yuan, a decrease of 10 yuan to 8 yuan, and the red sand stock at 234 yuan to 37 yuan, a decrease of more than 10 yuan. Yesterday, military notes reached a maximum of 6 yuan and 6 cents and a minimum of 6 yuan and 3 cents. The sugar allocated by the cooperative in March can be released one after another today and tomorrow. As for the sugar payment, 20% can be paid in national currency, converted into military notes at 4 yuan, 5 corners, and a half cents, and the remaining 80% must be paid entirely in military notes.

### Prices of Daily Necessities Rise Without End; Cigarette Prices Remain Stable

The cigarette market price is stable, because the financial storm has gradually subsided, speculative merchants are less active, and people's hearts are distracted and uncertain. The market is showing a spiral trend. The opening price for Great Britain brand was 8,500 yuan per box, Old Knife brand was 7,500 yuan, Five China brand was 5,000 yuan, Little Fairy brand was 5,100 yuan, Pinhai brand was 6,900 yuan, Japan Tobacco Gold Building was 2,600 yuan, and Golden Gun brand was 2,400 yuan, all of which rose and fell from yesterday's market price.

New purchase prices of daily necessities emerge one after another, and the rising trend is endless. In the sound of rare goods and poor sales, the general market peddlers keep raising prices. The price of Gu Ben soap is 275 yuan per box, Huang Xiangmao soap is 240 yuan, Bai Xiangmao soap is 250 yuan, and Phoenix brand matches are 3,300 yuan, and Ship brand foreign candles are a high price of 180 yuan. Looking at the market outlook, there is still a possibility of rising prices.

### The Lesson of the Shoe Shiner

— Zhou Mo

Walking along Henan Road, I saw two simple advertisements: "Shining shoes requires effort" and "No effort, no shine." My heartstrings were moved by them. Although making a living is so difficult these days, and the small matter of shining shoes shouldn't be handed over to others, I ended up supporting this advertisement, naturally sitting on the rattan chair waiting for customers. At this time, my feet were expecting a test of the effort he used!

Opened cans of shoe polish, empty ones, full ones, yellow ones, black ones, piled on one side of the stone steps. I carefully looked again at this advertisement with its sloppy handwriting. Besides the two tempting advertisements mentioned above, there were also a dozen lines of small print, saying, "Opened cans are no longer available, but I still have some in stock. If customers want to buy them, they will be sold at market price." This shows that even though shining shoes is a trivial matter, he also knows how to hoard goods, but he hasn't made it a rare commodity yet, and is willing to sell it at market price, which is much more charitable than the average hoarder.

He began shining my shoes. After washing with water and applying polish, he really used all his life's effort. He knew how to scrape away dirt and polish. Although he hadn't read many books, he discovered that Mozi's saying "Those who rely on their strength live, those who do not rely on their strength do not live" was his principle for survival. Indeed, the effort he put into shining shoes was more diligent than his peers, and he made a unique contribution to my leather shoes.

Three minutes, four cents. I began to doubt the value of a writer's words. I was sure that he couldn't survive without earning four cents per shine, so I started talking.

"Does it cost five cents to shine a pair of shoes?" He said it used to cost only two or three cents, but now it costs five cents. I was delighted that my words hadn't yet become detached from current social life, and I had hit the mark with my first guess. Next, I thought that even though he put in effort, his daily income was probably less than ten yuan, so I asked him how much he earned each day. "On a sunny day, I can make about twenty-some yuan, but on a rainy day, it's much less." Twenty-some yuan! This made me sigh at my own helplessness, and at the same time, it made me think that his emphasis on effort was truly reasonable. And even though everyone has strength, it was he who could contribute that strength to people's feet. He continued, saying that he had six mouths to feed at home, and his average monthly income was over four hundred yuan. His father used to work for a shipping company, but he lost his job two months ago and is now following in his son's footsteps. However, he lacks strength and doesn't have regular customers, so he can only earn six or seven yuan per day on average. These two numbers more clearly proved the value of his effort. I roughly calculated that their family's monthly income was six or seven hundred yuan at the moment. I couldn't help but sigh, admiring his courage to struggle for survival with all his might, and at the same time, becoming aware of my own future, with my heart and strength exhausted and my temples already graying. The times are urging people to "toil their muscles and bones and starve their bodies." Except for those who willingly give up, the shoe shiner's advertisement and Mozi's philosophy of strength should be passed down through the ages.

I felt ashamed in front of my shoes. Although you are shining, this shine is not the result of my effort. The shinier my shoes are, the deeper my laziness and sin are. One cannot be proud without self-reliance, and one cannot regenerate without self-reliance! The impression the shoe shiner left on me is deeply unforgettable, and the lesson of "self-reliance" came without any effort at all!

### Riding the Storm Together

— He Jiazhi

(2) Sorrow and Joy

But after Grandma Ye shouted loudly, she seemed to have lost consciousness again; although she sometimes opened her eyes, she didn't look at anyone. Mrs. Ye the Second said, "Sister-in-law, do you know? Weicheng is calling you. Weicheng is back. He is our treasure. He is very good, he is calling you, can you hear him? Mr. Huang's medicine will be ready soon, drink a small half bowl, and your illness will get better. Mothers shouldn't worry about their sons; sons shouldn't worry about their mothers; then everyone will get better. You said that next year, you must go to Shanghai and Suzhou with your son. Your son has grown up so much, he will definitely take you there. Sister-in-law, wake up, don't be so sleepy. Hee hee!"

Grandma Ye seemed to want to speak, but her tongue wouldn't obey her command. After letting her moisten her throat with ginseng soup, it still didn't work. Cuizhen brought in a little more than half a bowl of strained medicine. Weicheng took it in his hand, brought it to his mouth, and first tested the temperature, then tasted the medicine. He stood tremblingly in front of the bed and called out, "Mom, the medicine is here!" Mrs. Ye the Second helped to call out, "Sister-in-law, Weicheng is here to serve you medicine. Weicheng is your darling, he is so filial, and the medicine is like a magic pill, it will cure you if you drink it. Tomorrow, you will sit up and drink porridge. Now, open your mouth." Grandma Ye opened her mouth unnaturally, and everyone was happy. Magpie held a spoon, Cuizhen held the medicine bowl; the Second Aunt held a bowl of warm water that had been used to rinse the medicine, standing a little further back; Weicheng fed Grandma Ye one spoonful at a time. At first, three or four spoonfuls were okay, but later she couldn't take it, and it flowed from the corner of her mouth into her neck. Mrs. Ye the Second said, "Eat it later, don't rush." Weicheng fed her another spoonful of warm water, and it still flowed into her neck. The medicine bowl, warm water, and spoon were all mixed up on the dressing table, and Weicheng's sorrow came again, and he held his face and sobbed softly. (25)

### Bamboo Clapper Ballads

— Zefu

Bamboo clapper ballads, named because only bamboo clappers are used to control the beat during singing, and no other instruments are used. This type of ballad may have evolved from the lotus flower song, as lotus flower songs also use only bamboo clappers during singing, but the lyrics are more refined than those of lotus flower songs. This type of singing is popular in the areas of Hebei and Henan, but the singing in the two places is slightly different. The bamboo clappers used in Hebei consist of two bamboo clappers four inches long and one and a half inches wide, connected by a silk cord. The thumb supports the clappers between the two boards, and the clappers sound together. The songs are mostly biographical stories, compiled into lyrics, such as "Ant Fortune Telling," "Parrot Answering Questions," and "Names of Hundreds of Flowers." In Henan, in addition to the two large bamboo clappers supported by the left hand, the right hand also supports many small bamboo pieces strung together, commonly known as jiezi. There is also a gavel on the table, the same as other storytellers. The songs are mostly historical and fictional stories, with singing and dialogue, such as "Huarong Road," "Wu Song Fighting at the Inn," and "Pig Bajie Plowing the Earth." Occasionally, there are also songs of small tunes, such as "The Three Character Classic Advising Her Husband." At the beginning of the singing, there is an opening, and at the end, there is a closing. The tunes are divided into small tune and large tune. The small tune is singing allegro, and the large tune is singing largo. However, it is usually sung in allegro, so it is also called bamboo clapper quick ballad.

### The Road to Life

— By Du Yasheng, Illustrated by Jiang Dongliang

At first, seeing people fight over sesame cakes and steamed buns, although I didn't step up heroically to capture them alive, I always felt resentment towards their lack of "striving upwards"; gradually, I got used to it, and even seeing groups抢送货脚踏车 (i.e. groups rushing to deliver goods by bicycle - I can't quite translate this since it's a specific behavior) I could only let out a low sigh. At first, seeing a dead body in the alley, the words "white flour" (i.e. drugs) immediately surfaced in my mind, and sympathy arose from regret. Although sympathy is cheap for these "self-inflicted" cases, it wouldn't be denied. Yesterday, I personally saw a young man in his twenties collapse in an alley, his face pale, his bones emaciated, lightly calling out "Starving to death!" This was naturally not the effect of poison in the blood vessels, but rather because there was nothing for the stomach to absorb. When someone threw him a sesame cake, his greedy eyes only stared, unable to reach out and pick it up; in the end, he abandoned the food that could solve his "starving to death" and starved to death!

Being born as a human, besides the last resort of seeking death, the desire to live is above all else. Ruan Lingyu staked her life on "gossip is a fearful thing," and even when undergoing surgery, she shouted "I want to live!" However, how long can one survive by resorting to抢(i.e. snatching things)? The young man who was "starving to death" didn't even manage a kiss of the "delicious food" before him, most likely dying with his eyes unclosed.

Milling rice is a bitter task, with aching feet and back, being beaten and bleeding, but all of this is worth enduring, for no other reason than to live! From broken rice to corn flour, to red beans to sweet potatoes... still giving it our all, for no other reason than to live! Since rice produced within the country is not allowed to be transported into the concessions, rising before dawn to rush to Xujiahui, there is another new long snake (i.e. a long line), traveling long distances without considering it hardship, for no other reason than to live!

However, the road to life is so narrow, the cost of living is so high, the road to survival is like climbing on the edge of a knife, and falling down is indeed a bottomless abyss, and even after enduring a day, the knees and palms are covered in blood!

### "Spring is Ours"

— By Yiqing

'After I finished writing "Spring," the last time I put down my fountain pen, I turned around and looked around slightly tired, and the spring breeze came in from the window, gently brushing my cheeks, and the tiredness disappeared immediately. I knew that spring had arrived. I also remembered Shuying's words: Spring is ours...'

Mr. Ba said this in the preface to "Spring."

Indeed, it is spring now. In the gentle breeze of spring, I read the novel "Spring" (this is the third time reading it), and I also finished reading Mr. Hu Dao's adaptation of the play "Spring." Under my repeated heavy emotions, I pulled open the green gauze curtain and looked at the azure sky. I not only felt that this was spring, but also felt that there were many lively young people living in spring outside the sky.

Although spring has arrived, the sadness of winter still exists faintly. In "Spring," Hui and Shuying, the Juexin and Juemin brothers, are all struggling from the murderous winter, entrusting their fervent hopes to spring. Perhaps, the coldness of ice and the cold of snow suppress a fervent hope, even sacrificing it. Hui sacrificed so resentfully, and Juexin also holds a heart ready to sacrifice. Do they want to? No, it is the ice of winter, the snow of winter, that took away his and her heart and soul.

Spring is ultimately lovely. Having endured the difficulties and passed through winter, spring finally arrives. Look! Shuying and Juemin, etc., are warmed by the spring breeze and their young lives are growing.

"Spring" is on stage. These young drama partners, of course, also want to shout: "Spring is ours!"
