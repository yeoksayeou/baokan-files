### The Confusing Situation in Kharkov: Tank Battles Rage for Three Days and Nights, German Official Announcement Changes Strategy from Defense to Offense, Continued Fighting in Eastern Kerch

A Reuter's dispatch from Rome, May 22nd, reports that the main characteristic of the fighting in the Kharkov region is its intricate and confusing nature. The positions of both sides are interwoven, making them difficult to distinguish. Furthermore, the actions of both sides are extremely unpredictable. Therefore, military figures here refuse to comment, only saying that the great battle that will determine the fate of General Timoshenko's offensive has not yet begun. So far, the Red Army has far more manpower than the German army (but the German and Romanian allied forces have the upper hand strategically and technically. According to the latest news, the following observations can be made:

The main pressure of the Red Army is on the Krasno area, 60 miles southwest of Kharkov City. It is reported that the Red Army has made some progress. There are two infantry divisions, including four armored vehicle divisions, forming a circular position along the Donets River. Their vanguard is only 16 miles away from the city of Krasno. However, the current Red Army position is under pressure from the German army.

No news has been received from the Izyum area, east of Krasno, in the past 24 hours. However, military figures attach great importance to this and expect a major battle to break out in the area within days, which will determine the success or failure of the German spring offensive in the south.

In the direction of Slavyansk, German General Bock is concentrating a large number of motorized units, apparently attempting to defeat the Red Army's left flank. According to the latest news, the German army has advanced northward, occupying two strongholds on the left bank of the Donets River. If the German army can break through the Red Army line, three divisions of the Red Army will be in danger of being isolated.

In the Taganrog area, the German and Romanian allied forces have put pressure on the railway line from Taganrog to Rostov. The Axis forces have taken the initiative and it is expected that the German army will launch an offensive there as a prelude to the future conquest of the Caucasus.

A Reuter's dispatch from London, May 23rd, reports from Moscow that repeated German counterattacks in the Kharkov area have been repelled by the Red Army. The great tank battle there has lasted for three full days and nights. Although it has not completely stopped, the German army has reached the end of its strength and has suffered heavy losses of tanks.

A Havas dispatch from the German Führer Headquarters, May 23rd, states that this afternoon's German military report claimed that since May 12th, the Soviet army had launched a major offensive in the Kharkov area, deploying 20 infantry divisions, 3 cavalry divisions, and 15 armored vehicle brigades. But in the end, due to the heavy losses of manpower and material resources, it has collapsed. The German army launched a counterattack on May 17th, attacking the enemy's rear and cutting off its supply lines. In the past two days, the German, Romanian, and Hungarian allied forces, with the assistance of the air force, have changed from defense to offense, and the entire line of allied forces has launched a counterattack. The enemy southeast of Lake Ilmen has failed to attack and has suffered heavy losses. A detachment of the cut-off Soviet army was annihilated within a few days. In the Lapland region, the German and Finnish forces have won attacks. From May 10th to 21st, the Soviet air force lost 452 aircraft, including 342 shot down in air combat, 65 shot down by anti-aircraft guns, and 26 destroyed by infantry. The rest were destroyed on the ground. During this period, our aircraft lost only 45 aircraft in operations in Eastern Europe. The 6th Anti-Aircraft Artillery Regiment shot down as many as 200 enemy aircraft in Eastern Europe on May 22nd.

A Reuter's dispatch from Moscow, May 22nd, reports that the Soviet Union's communique tonight stated that yesterday our army consolidated its positions and continued offensive battles in the Kharkov area. In the Izyum-Barvenkovo ​​area, the German attack was repelled. In the three days of fighting, 15,000 Germans were killed. Fighting continues in the eastern part of the Kerch Peninsula. The day before yesterday, we destroyed 37 German aircraft and lost 13.

A Reuter's dispatch from Moscow, May 22nd, reports that the fierce tank battle in a certain area of Kharkov has not yet ended, but the German army is showing signs of fatigue. The German army is not as fierce as it was in the previous few days. The exact location of the battle has not been announced, but it is known that the German side has suffered extremely heavy losses. A tank battle of such duration is probably unprecedented. The Soviet army in the Izyum-Barvenkovo area has blocked the German counterattack for three days, thus securing its flank in Lozovaya. General Timoshenko is still able to maintain his offensive, and the German side has also suffered severe losses of tanks. The German 21st Tank Division has been defeated, and the 23rd Tank Division has suffered a major blow.

A Havas dispatch from Berlin, May 22nd, military sources report that between April 28th and May 13th, the Red Army launched nine attacks in the Murmansk region, all of which were repelled by our army. The weather in Hua Road is still extremely cold, and most of the battles are fought in ice and snow.

### U.S.-French Relations Gradually Improving

Germany Remains Silent on This

A Havas dispatch from Vichy, May 23rd, states that since Washington officially announced that the U.S. government fully understands France's difficult situation, and U.S. Secretary of State Hull has stated that U.S.-French negotiations on the Antilles Islands can continue, people in Vichy have paid close attention to this, believing that the serious situation caused by the U.S. government's memorandum on May 9th has improved. However, responsible parties here stated that France has not changed its attitude stated in the dispatch sent to Washington on May 13th, that is, the negotiations on the French Antilles should be conducted through diplomatic channels by the French Ambassador to the United States, Hai-Henri.

A Havas dispatch from Vichy, May 22nd, regarding the issue of the French island of Martinique, well-informed sources here said that it is still unknown what conditions the local authorities of the island and the representatives of the U.S. Navy have decided on in the negotiations. Generally speaking, before General Robert's report is sent to Vichy and the government issues new instructions, the authorities may not release any news. On the U.S. side, Secretary of State Hull told reporters yesterday that the negotiations were progressing well, although there were some difficulties, it is hoped that an agreement can be reached with General Robert.

A Havas dispatch from Berlin, May 22nd, states that there is extreme silence here regarding U.S.-French relations, but semi-official sources pointed out that the problems posed by U.S.-French relations can only be resolved by France. As for the German side, it must wait for France to state its position before it can react. At the same time, there is also the same silence here on the issue of Franco-German relations, only stating that Germany is completely based on the armistice agreement that dominates and determines the current Franco-German relations.

### Hollywood Actress Priscilla Lane Marries

### Mexican President Convenes Special Congress

Will Request Declaration of War Against the Axis Powers, If Passed, It Will Be the Only One in a Century

An Allied dispatch from Argentina, May 23rd, reports from Mexico City today that Mexican President Camacho has convened a special meeting of Congress to request a declaration of war against Japan, Germany, and Italy. Mexico's declaration of war against the Axis powers is becoming inevitable. The Mexican cabinet held a special meeting yesterday, where President Camacho and the ministers discussed the Mexican government's attitude towards the sinking of Mexican ships by Axis submarines in U.S. territorial waters. If President Camacho's request is passed by Congress, it will be Mexico's first declaration of war in ninety-five years. The Mexican President has ordered the Standing Committee of Congress to immediately convene a special plenary meeting.

Mexican Army Will Not Be Sent Overseas

A Reuter's dispatch from Mexico City, May 23rd, states that Mexico is expected to declare war on the Axis powers. Former President General Cárdenas will be responsible for handling all war actions, the nature of which will be confidential. At the same time, the Mexican government has banned Mexican banks from accepting U.S. dollar checks to prevent Axis nationals from withdrawing cash, as most of their deposits are in U.S. dollars. The attitude of labor groups shows that the left wing is also strongly advocating for war. The position of the right wing is less clear. However, political circles expect that whether the Mexican government declares war or not, it will confiscate Axis property in Mexico. Mexican Army Chief of Staff General Sanchez stated today that the Mexican Army will defend the country but will not be sent overseas. In addition, Mexican Foreign Minister Padilla announced that twenty crew members of the second Mexican oil tanker, "Olo" (6,000 tons), which was torpedoed, escaped. The ship was sunk off the coast of Florida in the United States at 10 p.m. on Wednesday night. The escaped crew members were rescued by the U.S. Coast Guard and suffered no serious injuries. Nine crew members were killed. At the same time, the sinking of the Mexican ship "Oxaca" was disclosed last night. The ship sailed from Veracruz to Havana a month ago and must have sunk at least two weeks ago. Another Mexican ship, "Tuksuban," sailed from a certain foreign port to Tampico nine days ago, but has not arrived on schedule and there is no news. The crew members who survived the sinking of the first Mexican oil tanker "Reno" have returned here by train from the United States.

Crude Oil Will Be Transported to the U.S. by Rail

A Havas dispatch from Mexico City, May 22nd, states that after the Mexican oil tanker "Reno" was sunk by an Axis submarine, negotiations with the authorities have not yielded any results. Unexpectedly, one wave has not subsided and another has risen. The Mexican oil tanker "Olo" was sunk off the coast of Cuba last night. The general public was shocked and expected the government to declare war on the Axis powers tonight or tomorrow. The cabinet convened a meeting today, and various military authorities also scheduled a special meeting today. It is believed that the President has already drafted the declaration of war and is preparing to submit it to Congress for approval. The commanders of various military air forces have also been ordered to remain stationed at their posts. After the cabinet meeting, Congress will be convened in a special session to decide whether to declare war or declare a state of emergency, so as to take strict measures against Axis nationals and their property. At the same time, official sources stated that after the sinking of the oil tanker "Reno," the government protested to Germany and demanded compensation. The German reply was evasive and President Camacho could not be satisfied. In short, after Mexico declares war on the Axis powers in the future, the domestic crude oil will be transported to the United States by rail to avoid the danger of oil tankers when transporting it by sea.

A Havas dispatch from Stockholm, May 23rd, states that the Mexican cabinet meeting yesterday discussed important matters for four hours and decided to recommend war against the Axis powers. Once the parliament approves it in early next week, it will declare war.

### Current War Will Likely Be Protracted

Roosevelt Says Not to Be Overly Optimistic

An Allied dispatch from Lisbon, May 22nd, reports from Washington that U.S. Secretary of State Hull recently said that the Allied victory may be earlier than expected a few months ago. However, President Roosevelt did not share this optimism when he met with foreign visitors today. When a reporter asked if the country was too optimistic about the progress of the war, the President replied in the affirmative. Public opinion rises and falls with changes in the situation. In fact, this war will definitely be protracted. It would be better if we could prevent such ups and downs. A Havas dispatch from Washington, May 22nd, states that President Roosevelt told the press today that "the current war is likely to be protracted. We must not be overly optimistic at one moment and overly pessimistic at another. We must not attach too much importance to any change and deeply hope that the American press can work with the government to keep the people calm." A Havas dispatch from Washington, May 22nd, states that former Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee Needles recently told the press that the people should not be overly optimistic. There is no reason to believe that Germany's current situation is as bad as it was in 1917. Germany is currently experiencing major difficulties, but it is by no means on the verge of collapse. As for hoping that Britain will try its best to revitalize itself and open a second battlefield this year, this is also absolutely impossible. In my opinion, Britain's activities will be temporarily limited to continuous aerial bombardment to destroy German factories.

### New York Gradually Takes on a Wartime Atmosphere

Few Cars, Silent Nights

A Havas dispatch from New York, May 22nd, states that since the military began operations, the city has gradually taken on a wartime atmosphere. The whole city is silent and there are few cars on the streets. The huge neon lights that illuminated Broadway, Fifth Avenue, and Times Square are no longer seen. Street lights have also been greatly reduced. At night, most streets are dark as漆, and the towering buildings look like high mountains. Other important roads such as Broadway, Manhattan Road, and Fifth Avenue have reduced all street lights by two-thirds. After 7:00 p.m., all shop windows in the city are extinguished, and after 10:00 p.m., residents have fallen asleep, and the city is as silent as a dead city. In addition, windows in the house must be covered with curtains to prevent light from leaking out. The authorities have also dispatched many police officers to inspect behind private residences every night, and special police officers are also stationed on the tops of the "skyscrapers" to monitor the movements of nearby residential buildings. The New York City Police Department announced that a blackout will be implemented in Manhattan on the evening of the 23rd. An Allied dispatch from Lisbon, May 23rd, states that according to a broadcast by the British Broadcasting Corporation, New York implemented a complete blackout last night, lasting thirty minutes. An Allied dispatch from Argentina, May 23rd, reports from Los Angeles that the U.S. Civil Defense Department today ordered that all lights along the coast of Southern California that can be seen at sea be covered.

This is the fifth registration in accordance with the Wartime Service Act.

Currently, 4 million men have been registered nationwide.

### U.S. Federation of Labor Accepts Salary Stabilization Method

A Havas dispatch from Washington, May 22nd, states that President Roosevelt told the press today that "I am determined to do everything in my power to stop the 'unreasonable salary increases' of private industrial organizations in the country, so that all private companies can abide by the government's salary stabilization policy. A salary increase by one company will inevitably cause dissatisfaction among other workers."

The German submarine suffered no losses. The German military released the details of the cannon battle last night, stating that a U.S. cargo ship, about 10,000 tons, was bombed by a German submarine before entering a certain port on the east coast of the United States. The ship returned fire with cannons. Two other German submarines rushed to the scene upon hearing the news and engaged in a cannon battle with it. At that time, the ship had been hit and caught fire. Half an hour later, the ship gradually sank, followed by multiple hits, emitting thick smoke and disappearing into the water. The ship was loaded with rubber needed by the American military industry. The German submarine suffered no losses. A Havas dispatch from Berlin, May 23rd, states that the German High Command supplemented its announcement from yesterday afternoon, stating that the British Glasgow cargo ship "Cape of Good Hope" (4,963 tons) was sunk by a German submarine east of the Antilles Islands. The ship was carrying armored vehicles and was sailing back to Britain from New York. It sank within a few minutes after being hit by a torpedo. A Havas dispatch from Washington, May 22nd, states that the Navy Department announced that a medium-sized American cargo ship was torpedoed in the Gulf of Mexico this morning.

### The Full Picture of Martinique Island

Before the situation in Madagascar is over, the negotiations between France and the United States on Martinique Island are also stalled. This island, in terms of area, is less than a thousand square miles, and it is a remote place. The protectors may not be fully aware of everything on Martinique Island. Therefore, we have once again asked Mr. Nanshan to give a faithful introduction to the full picture of this so-called "small island", which I believe is also what our readers would like to read. Editor

The negotiations between France and the United States on Martinique Island have been going on for many days, but so far no concrete plan has been agreed upon, and the main key to the problem seems to have not been resolved. Although Martinique Island is just a small island, with a total area of only 988 square miles, only one-230th the size of Madagascar, such a remote island would perhaps not even be looked at by the Americans in peacetime, but in wartime, the situation is completely different. Therefore, even a country like the United States, which is always generous, has to haggle over it. Looking at the map, Martinique Island is located in the Caribbean Sea, east of Central America, only 130 miles away from Guadeloupe. It is the exit channel of the Panama Canal and a hub for traffic between the two oceans.

Speaking of Martinique Island, its history is only a few hundred years old. In the past, it was just a piece of barren land in the vast ocean. It was not until Columbus's fourth voyage of exploration in the 16th century that the island was discovered. After that, it gradually attracted the attention of European powers. The island first belonged to Portugal, and it was not officially under French jurisdiction until 1625. Therefore, it has been under French rule for more than 300 years. During this period, it was once occupied by the United Kingdom in 1762, 1794, and 1809, but soon withdrew. Therefore, it is actually France's oldest colony in the Atlantic.

The word Martinique is derived from the Carib language, originally named NIdlannia. It is 65 kilometers long from north to south, and the maximum width from east to west is 34 miles. The northern coast is flat, and the southeast is more tortuous. The bay area has dense coral reefs, which are extremely beautiful against the backdrop of the deep blue sea. From the eastern Grande Anse along the coast to Port France, the Caravelb Peninsula, Galiou Bay, Robert Port, Iron Cape, and Marie Bay are all military strongholds. The entire island is formed by volcanic lava. The mountains run across the island. Mount Pelee in the north is 1,350 meters high, and the Pltons du Carbet in the west is slightly lower. The southern coastal area has the lowest terrain and is the only Lamentin Plain on the island (where Lamentin is located). The Lezard River runs through it, but the water flow is rapid. During the annual dry season, the riverbed is dry, but once the rainy season arrives, it rises immediately. Therefore, the low-lying areas on both sides are often flooded from July to October, which greatly affects crops.

Martinique Island has a hot and dry climate with no snow all year round. The best climate is from December to March of the following year, which is also the best season for travel. Because of the hot weather, the land is fertile, and crops are produced quickly. The island is rich in sugarcane, coffee, cocoa, tobacco, spices, etc. All tropical plants are available. In addition, Martinique Island is also a famous fruit producing area. The amount of fruit transported from here to the United States and Europe every year is considerable. The fruit produced on Martinique Island is delicious and thick, so it is quite famous. Martinique is also an island with tropical forests and pastures. In the dense and lush bushes, there is a triangular-headed poisonous snake. Every year, many people die from hunting this snake.

The total population of Martinique Island is about 200,000, which is not as good as a medium-sized city. The population on the island is mainly black people and mixed black and white races, most of whom have Indian blood. In addition, there are also Indian Africans among the immigrants, and there are many Chinese who travel across the ocean to do business here. The natives of Martinique have dark brown skin, large ears, and sunken bridges of their noses. Honesty and simplicity are their nature. The girls of Martinique may not have the gentleness and delicacy that girls in other places have, but they have a different kind of charm. Wearing their wide, old-fashioned, drooping silk robes, crossed scarves on their chests, and amber or gold necklaces swaying around their necks, they shine in the strong sunlight. And the ridiculous little hats that look like pendulums, constantly dangling on the top of their heads, all this will give you a special and novel feeling.

Because of the special geological structure, in the previous century, volcanic eruptions occurred from time to time, especially the islanders living in the near mountainous areas were even more worried all day long. Later, it was quiet for decades, so the old people, based on experience, said that they could live a good life in the future. They also confirmed that the volcanic spring of Mount Pelee had gone out. As soon as the news came out, everyone was naturally overjoyed, thinking that there would be no more accidents. Who knew that things in the world often exceeded people's expectations? Just when you thought it was peaceful, God would deliberately show you a color. Sure enough, not long after, in May 1902, the dead volcanic spring rested for a while and roared again. This time, because people were unprepared, the losses were naturally not light. It is said that the fire head was as high as 1,617 feet high. You have never seen it, but just imagining it should scare you speechless. As a result of this volcanic eruption, the city of Saint Pierre was completely destroyed and has not been rebuilt to this day. This used to be the essence of Martinique in the previous century, but now only broken bricks and tiles remain. On the desolate coast, a few dilapidated fishing boats are floating. Every time the sun sets at dusk, the last ray of faint light is smeared on this collapsed ruin, making it even more desolate. Who would have thought that this was once a prosperous city with crowded cars and horses forty years ago? As a result, those old people who specialized in bragging about their experience also shut up from then on. Now, when people ask him; my dear old father, do you know if the volcano of Mount Pelee will erupt again, our old man hesitantly shook his head up and down, showing a trace of confusion and bitterness, he said slowly: "Ask the sky!"

The disasters suffered by Martinique Island seem to be very severe. Not to mention the volcano, which should make people change color when mentioned, but in addition to this, it is also constantly threatened by hurricanes, especially on the southeast coast. Every year in July and August, the property and livestock lost due to this cruel attack are quite a considerable number. Every midnight, hearing the roaring storm, the house is shaken and trembled, who would not feel chills!

Since we are talking about this island, then we must mention its political center, which is the harbor called Fort-de-France. A ship sailing on the ocean slowly approaches here, and then you will see on the distant coast, there are steep and uneven rocks, and the fierce waves are hitting, and then countless white foams are splashed on the dark shining reefs. Looking further away, you will also see some scattered and low thatched huts; winding mountains, and dense tropical sugarcane trees, this is Fort-de-France, which is currently the place of US-France negotiations that the world is paying attention to.

Entering the city, the first impression given to a distant tourist is cleanliness and openness. Under the towering, verdant, and shady palm trees on both sides, there is a wide and flat avenue unfolding in front of you. Fort-de-France has a vast lawn, which is used for parades and competitions during festivals. The podium is covered with old and lush branches of black plum trees. Nearby stands a statue of Empress Josephine, which is made of fine white marble. It is often covered with a pile of white palm petals blown down by the wind.

Fort-de-France has an arsenal. The port is often moored with battleships. This is an important military town on the island. In the past, because of the inferiority of the armaments, the defense force was extremely weak. However, since Governor Gourberl and General Mangin reorganized it more than ten years ago, there has been obvious progress in national defense. The Martinique native army made a lot of efforts for France during the last European war and left many glorious achievements. Martinique Island implements a conscription system, but because of the strict physical examination and the small population, there are not many recruits, and together with the French army, there are less than 10,000.

Fort-de-France has gradually become a prototype of a modern city in the market. There is a well-equipped church hospital here, which has contributed a lot to the city's sanitary administration. Education is not very popular, but there are also complete primary and secondary schools. In addition, Fort-de-France also has an experimental plant, that wide garden, and ancient seal style, which is a place where the residents of the city often visit and relax. The experimental botanical garden is also constantly seeking to improve plant seeds, so it is also a scientific farm. It often provides residents with coffee and cocoa tree species with satisfactory experimental results.

The former residence of the late General Gallieni in the city is still preserved. For this pioneer of the colonial world, an indelible impression has been left on the minds of the islanders. In order to commemorate this visionary great man, the cocoa trees he personally planted during his lifetime are still guarded by skilled gardeners, and the arrangement of his house has not been moved. Now it is being visited by tourists like a monument.

Generally speaking, Martinique Island, apart from those inevitable natural disasters, is a fairly lovely place. The people here, like Madagascar, are also based on agriculture. The young people here are happy; honest; healthy. They usually work very hard, but during festivals, they will also be crazy and happy for a while. Boat racing and swimming are their main entertainment.

Regarding Martinique Island, because of the limited space, we only briefly introduce it. Now the negotiations between the United States and France on this island are still in progress, and the outcome of future development is still unknown. Furthermore, the storms that France has experienced in the past two years can be said to have risen and fallen here, constantly suffering some unexpected events, but no matter whether Darlan is in power or Laval takes the stage, France's attitude of seeking to settle matters and appease people has never changed, and some places in France still have to rely on the United States for food supply, and so although it has been stimulated several times, it does not mention it after the event. But the things in the world often have unpredictable places, and we don't have to make a prediction about the end of the US-France negotiations. Fortunately, the play is not over yet, so let the readers watch it themselves! (End of the article)

### Relevant Authorities in This City Planning to Establish Price Control Bureau

To Curb the Continued Rise in Prices, a Concrete Plan is Currently Being Drafted

The English "Ta Mei Evening News" reported that the Japanese "Continental New Report" today (the 22nd) stated that the relevant authorities in this city, in order to curb the continued rise in prices, are considering setting up a price control bureau or an economic inspection bureau. The Japanese authorities attach great importance to the price situation in this city, because the current situation is indeed enough to hinder the reorganization of Shanghai's economic system and the policy of stabilizing people's livelihood. Therefore, they are accelerating the drafting of a concrete plan to suppress prices, and plan to cooperate closely with the authorities of the two concessions and the Chinese territory to establish a price control bureau or an economic inspection bureau to deal with it.

### Shanghai Municipal Council Announcement: New Rice Price

Implemented Simultaneously in the French Concession; The Number of Rice Shops Will Increase

The Shanghai Municipal Council announced that the retail price of rice will be 6.3 yuan per half liter starting today (Sunday), which is 4.2 yuan per liter, an increase of 8.66 mao. The French Concession authorities, in order to take parallel steps with the Public Concession, also posted an announcement today, saying, "For the matter of notification, from the 24th of this month (Sunday) until a new announcement, the maximum retail price of rice in the French Concession is 6.3 yuan in legal tender per half liter. This is to inform everyone. This is announced by the French Consul General, Magerel." Today, the 372 rice shops in the two concessions will charge 6.3 yuan in legal tender per half liter for retail. The business hours will still be extended from 8:00 am to 6:00 pm. Because the total amount of rice sold by each rice shop is more than 10,000 bags, the supply will definitely be widespread.

Number of Rice Shops in the Two Concessions

The Shanghai Municipal Council also restricted the operation of rice shops in January this year. Only 397 rice shops were allowed to exist in the two concessions, and more than half of the rice shops were ordered to stop operating. Recently, 25 rice shops have voluntarily closed down or had their licenses revoked. The actual number of existing rice shops is only 372.

Suspended Rice Shops Allowed to Resume Business

The Rice and Grain Management Committee, in view of the fact that the supply of rice has recently been abundant, which is very different from the situation at that time, and that the summer heat is approaching, and the current crowding situation is very unsuitable for hygiene, and that the number of originally existing rice shops has also decreased, should be supplemented. Based on the above reasons, it was decided to increase the number of rice shops. The method of increasing the number of rice shops has been officially announced by the Rice and Grain Management Committee. The suspended rice shops other than the existing rice shops are allowed to apply in writing to the committee within a time limit. The submission of this written application to the bureau does not mean that the rice shop has been allowed to resume business. The rice shop allowed to resume business should pay a deposit of 5,000 yuan in designated currency.

### Department Stores, Apartments, Etc. Revise New Prices

Starting from the 24th

According to Allied Press, the authorities have approved that the sales prices of eight department stores in the two concessions, such as Wing On, Sincere, The Sun, Dah Sun, Welfare, Whiteaway Laidlaw, China National Products, and Lai Wah, as well as the room rates and food and beverage expenses of hotels and apartments, will all be priced in reserve certificates starting today (the 24th). This pricing is based on the market price on the 22nd of this month. However, if customers do not have reserve certificates, they will still be allowed to pay in legal tender according to the market price on that day.

### Yishenghao Donates Money to Help Students

Yesterday, this newspaper received a letter from Yishenghao, generously donating 5,000 yuan to this newspaper's student aid fund. The original letter said, "To whom it may concern, in this time of chaos and war, and amidst the panic of unemployment, there are countless poor children who cannot afford to study. As a result, countless outstanding talents are buried, which is a loss to the country and society, and a misfortune for poor children. Especially those promising young people who are ambitious but lack financial assistance, their painful situation cannot be described in words. In view of this, our store, knowing that your newspaper has a student aid fund, hereby presents 5,000 yuan in national currency, to do our part. However, individual strength is limited, and we hope that just people in society will expand their assistance. To the Shen Bao Student Aid Fund Committee, Yishenghao, May 23, 1942." Yishenghao's benevolence and righteousness are deeply admired. On behalf of the poor students, we express our deepest gratitude. The student aid funds received yesterday include 5,000 yuan from Yishenghao and 2.10 yuan from the rice sales office on Huasheng Road, totaling 5,002.10 yuan. With the previous balance of 57,714.69 yuan, the total balance is 61,736.79 yuan.

### Authorities in the Two Concessions Actively Preparing for Rationing of Rice; Expected to Implement in Mid-June

According to Allied Press, the authorities in this city have decided to fully implement the rice rationing system. The method of purchasing rice with a passbook has already been implemented for Japanese residents and Japanese-owned industrial, commercial, and business employees. The Public Concession and the French Concession authorities, in order to reduce rice consumption and to resolve the difficulty of purchasing rice for ordinary Chinese residents, are expected to implement the rice rationing system in mid-June. They are currently busy preparing for it. The rice purchasing method is based on the previous census, and rice tickets will be distributed to each Chinese household. After the implementation of this method, the past difficulty in purchasing rice can be completely resolved. As for the rice for employees in the factories in the concession, the convenience of large-scale supply will be given according to the importance of the factory. In the past, the work of the workers in each factory was almost at a standstill due to the difficulty of purchasing rice. Therefore, it is generally believed that the rice rationing system can also revitalize the activities of the industrial community in this city.

### Case of the Owner of Jinding Qixiang Candle Shop Being Accused; Detective Dismissed

The Truth of the Case Will Not Be Difficult to Uncover

Dama Guifang, a local resident, is 67 years old and is the owner of the Jinding Qixiang Candle Shop at the intersection of Beile Road and Wangzhi Road. On the evening of March 26th of this year, at around 9 o'clock, detectives from the French police went to search and seized a pistol and a set of smoking paraphernalia. They were taken to the police station. Because Ma was old and dozens of well-established shops jointly guaranteed him to the French police, he was allowed to be released on bail pending trial. The details have been recorded in previous reports. Now it is learned that Ma has hired defense lawyer Hu Yongsheng to file a defense, the gist of which is that the defendant has always been law-abiding and has been running the candle shop for more than a hundred years. There has never been a criminal dispute. This time, someone coveted the defendant's meager assets and made a plan to frame him, intending to extort money. After the incident, he demanded a huge sum of 100,000 yuan. The defendant could not comply, so he was prosecuted. After several trials, the authorities have already understood the inside story, thoroughly investigated the truth, and pursued the person who came forward to report the case, Kuang Jingshou. The handling detective has been dismissed, which will make it possible to uncover the truth of the case. It was concluded yesterday and set for judgment.

### YWCA Moves Office

For the convenience of members from various districts to travel to and from, the Shanghai YWCA has moved its office to 638 Weihaiwei Road. The telephone number remains 34924.

### Family Disputes After the Death of Zhu Xin'an

The second son and the stepmother are at odds, now mediating from within. Following the death of a certain Mr. Zhu, a wealthy silk merchant residing at No. 6 Yong Village, West Avenue, family disputes have arisen. According to a close friend of the late Mr. Zhu, Mr. Zhu possessed assets amounting to tens of millions and left behind ten sons. The eldest son had already passed away. The second son, Zhongping, and the third son, Shuhu, are both married. The youngest two sons were born to Consort Yan. Due to Mr. Zhu's declining health in the past two or three years, all business and property rights were entrusted to his second son, Zhongping. Zhongping has been at odds with his stepmother, so after Mr. Zhu's death, there have been frequent quarrels. It was recently reported that a maid was injured and has been sent to the hospital for treatment. The various disputes are difficult to resolve. Fortunately, a highly respected friend of the late Mr. Zhu is now mediating, hoping that the sons will accept advice and peacefully divide the inheritance. As for rumors of Mr. Zhu having a concubine, these are unfounded. If there were one, she would certainly come forward to claim her rights. It is noted that Mr. Zhu is none other than the philanthropist Zhu Xin'an, who dedicated his life to charitable endeavors and benefiting the poor. It is truly regrettable that such disputes have arisen among the mother, sons, and brothers after his death.

### Crime Statistics for April

According to information released by the Shanghai Municipal Council's Intelligence Department, the Commissioner of Police reported on the general work situation for April.

This is 222 cases fewer than in March and 91 cases fewer than in April of the previous year. A total of 2,430 criminals were arrested, also fewer than the 2,580 arrested in March. In addition, 132 individuals were arrested for crimes committed in previous months, and 69 were arrested on behalf of other authorities. Among those arrested within the Council's jurisdiction that month, 134 were armed robbers, and 14 pieces of military equipment and a batch of ammunition were seized.

In District A that month, there were 31 cases of shoplifting and theft of goods, 8 more than in March, resulting in the arrest of 40 thieves. There were 238 cases of pickpocketing, 21 fewer than in March, resulting in the arrest of 208 people. 219 bicycles were reported stolen, of which 35 were recovered, and 44 thieves were arrested. The Narcotics Division conducted 16 searches, arresting 53 people. All police stations handled 18 narcotics cases, arresting 67 people and seizing 108.5 ounces of opium, 27.5 ounces of heroin, and 29 opium pipes. The total value of stolen property reported that month was 2,232,705.7 national currency units, of which 723,280.3 units were recovered, representing 34.23% of the total amount.

Significant progress was made in handling Baojia (neighborhood watch) matters in April, particularly in the organization of Baojia and the successive establishment of self-defense corps under the supervision of the Shanghai Municipal Council's police. The household registration survey in the police districts south of the Suzhou River was partially completed by the end of the month. Five grenade attacks occurred within the International Settlement, four of which resulted in explosions, killing one Chinese person and injuring 18. A total of 337,555 people arrived in Shanghai that month, and 361,856 people departed.

### Record of the Bathing Buddha Festival at the Jing'an Temple

The scene of citizens offering incense and paying homage was as grand as ever. The stalls inside the temple were sparse, and business was slow. The annual festival at the Jing'an Temple in Shanghai's west has already begun the other day. However, its grandeur is not what it used to be. Before the war, every year around the Bathing Buddha Festival (April 8th of the lunar calendar), ordinary pious men and women would hang yellow incense bags on their shoulders and travel in an endless stream, competing to offer the first incense. The temple was ablaze with candles, and the air was filled with incense smoke. The halls were full of people paying homage, creating an extremely lively scene. Around the temple, various roads were lined with displays of woodenware, bamboo ware, pottery, rattan ware, and household utensils, etc., for people to buy. Although this year's Bathing Buddha Festival still has this decoration, there are only a few customers, far less than in the past.

History of the Temple

People who have lived in Shanghai for a long time are very familiar with the Jing'an Temple. It is said that the temple was originally built on the north bank of the Wusong River, during the Chiwu reign of the Wu Kingdom. At that time, the temple was called Jianchu, which is recorded in great detail in the Yun Jian Zhi. Therefore, the Jing'an Temple has a history of 1,800 years. It was not until 1008, to avoid the taboo of Emperor Taizu of the Song Dynasty, that it was renamed Jing'an. It was once renamed Yongtai Chan Temple. The old temple site was originally located on the riverbank, and at that time it was moved by the temple monk Zhongyi to the bubbling spring next to the Lupu River, which is the current temple site.

Eight Views of Jing'an

The Jing'an Temple base covers an area of 25 mu. The rent was exempted in the first year of the Qianlong reign. Since the Yuan and Ming dynasties, the houses have been repaired and rebuilt. Later, local people raised money to repair it, and the temple was completely renewed. In Jing'an Temple, there are the Chiwu Stele, the Song Dynasty Hui Sutra Platform, Shrimp Pond, Yongquan Spring, Yuan Yun Cave, Shanghai Fortress, and Luzidu Ferry, known as the Eight Views of Jing'an. Today, there is no way to verify them. Among the Eight Views of Jing'an, the only one that still has traces to be found is Yongquan Spring. Yongquan Spring is an ancient well in front of the temple gate, with a spring eye that can be found, said to be the sixth spring in the world. The western name of today's Jing'an Temple Road is (Bubbling Well Rd.), which is taken from this.

Incense Fair Market

The Bathing Buddha Festival on the eighth day of the fourth month of the lunar calendar is the birthday of Sakyamuni Buddha in India, which is more than 3,000 years ago. The Jing'an Temple is extremely lively every time this period comes around. Because the temple connects to the villages in western Shanghai, and the temple base is grand and spacious, general small crafts products, such as woodenware, bamboo ware, rattan ware, toys, leather boxes, farm tools, furniture, and sundries, etc., are set up in stalls for sale around the temple. From east to He De Road, south to Di Cao Road, west to Jessfield Road, and north to Jing'an Temple Road, there are stalls everywhere. The temple is also full of people. Stallholders only need to pay four yuan to the temple's accounting office to obtain a permit to trade freely. Before the war, about three or four thousand permits were issued during the incense fair period, and the temple could earn more than ten thousand yuan in income.

Decline of the Scene

After the changes, the police authorities prohibited setting up stalls on the roads every year during the Bathing Buddha Festival, and most shops moved to the temple to sell, and the grand scene gradually declined. However, today it is even more declining. There are only thirty or forty stalls, and the stall rental fee has risen to 30 yuan in legal tender per stall. Although the number of incense pilgrims is similar to last year, the purchasing power is very weak. One reason is the rising prices, which have soared five, six, or even more than ten times. The second reason is that there are many department stores nearby, and household appliances can be bought everywhere, so there is no need to wait for the arrival of the Bathing Buddha Festival.

Business is Slow

Yesterday, the reporter braved the rain to visit. The scope of the market has been greatly reduced, limited to inside and outside the temple. Except for the temporary sheds in the temple, displaying rattan, wood, bamboo, straw mats, farm tools, toys, furniture and other sundries, there are no other novel items. When asked by stallholders, they all said that the business situation is getting worse and worse, and very slow. Therefore, the temple's annual income from stall rentals has also sharply decreased.

Revitalizing Buddhist Studies According to Monk Mijia, the supervisor of Jing'an Temple, after the death of the abbot Zhiwen last autumn, Monk Dewu took over as abbot. Dewu graduated from the Jiaoshan Buddhist Academy and the Fuzhou Minnan Buddhist Academy, and his thinking is quite new. The temple has also hired abbots from various temples as consultants, such as the old monk Tanyue of Changshu Baoyan Temple, Abbot Mijia of Ningbo Baiyi Temple, and the old monk Zhifang of Nanshi Qinglian Chan Temple, to carefully reorganize and reform the internal affairs, and plans to create a Buddhist righteous school and run a Buddhist monthly magazine, which are currently being planned.

### British and American Civilians in Manila Send Letters of Comfort to Relatives and Friends in Shanghai

According to the English-language "Greater Shanghai Evening Post," British and American civilians detained at the University of Santo Tomas in Manila recently sent letters to relatives and friends in Shanghai. A total of 250 letters were brought by Uno, a member of the Shanghai Japanese Army Press Section, and delivered to the English-language "Greater Shanghai Evening Post" for distribution. The recipients who went to pick them up this morning (22nd) were quite crowded, receiving the letters as if they had obtained a precious treasure, and they were delighted to learn that life in detention was still peaceful. As for neutral nationals or prisoners of war in the Philippines, no letters were brought.

### Former U.S. Military Officer Stationed in Shanghai, McLins, Becomes Prisoner of War in the Philippines

Heavy Casualties in the Battles of Bataan Peninsula and Corregidor Island; Two Officers Also Lost According to the English-language "Greater Shanghai Evening Post," Uno, of the Shanghai Japanese Army Press Section, recently returned from Manila. Yesterday (21st), at a reception for newspaper reporters, he described the war at Corregidor Fortress, stating that the U.S. Marine Corps 4th Regiment, formerly stationed in Shanghai and transferred to the Philippines just before the outbreak of the Pacific War, bore the brunt of the battles on Bataan Island and Corregidor Island. He met with Colonel Howard (former commander of the U.S. Marine Corps in Shanghai, later also commander of the U.S. Marine Corps on Corregidor Island) and learned that the U.S. Army and Navy suffered the heaviest casualties, with the Marine Corps suffering the most. However, only two senior Marine Corps officers were lost, namely Major Landis and Captain Jia Sirechu, who were formerly stationed in Shanghai.

Fierce Fighting on Corregidor

After the Japanese army landed on Corregidor Island, the U.S. military on the island was still able to mount effective opposition, but the U.S. military surrendered very quickly. The reason for this is unknown. Perhaps the U.S. military thought that the Japanese army had already occupied the southern part of Corregidor Island. The Japanese army also suffered heavy losses in the attack on Corregidor. The first batch of Japanese troops suffered particularly heavy losses when they landed, and the landing mission was quite dangerous. It was the night of May 6th, with no starlight or moonlight, and it was pitch black. The first batch of Japanese suicide squads set off in boats to carry out the plan to gather one mile off the west coast of Corregidor Island. Unfortunately, before the Japanese army landed, they were discovered, and the small boats became the target of intense U.S. artillery fire. Strong searchlights were also turned on to search. The Japanese suffered heavy casualties.

Successful Landing Despite Sacrifices

However, some arrived on Corregidor, landed, and held their ground, lying in the mud until the second batch of Japanese troops arrived at 4:00 a.m. The first batch of attacking Japanese troops rode in 18 or 20 boats, while the second batch of Japanese troops numbered several thousand, riding in many boats. At the same time, the Japanese artillery and aircraft also launched fierce attacks in the dark. After the Japanese army successfully landed, they occupied Mount Malinta, the highest point on Corregidor Island. The U.S. military officers captured in this battle included Lieutenant General Wainwright, commander-in-chief of the U.S. military in the Philippines, Major General Beebe, chief of staff, Major General Moore, commander of the Manila coastal defenses, Captain Hofel, acting commander of the U.S. Navy in the Philippines, and Colonel Howard, commander of the U.S. Marine Corps. They all believed that the reasons for the U.S. military's surrender were lack of reinforcements, the Japanese army's superior mechanized warfare tactics, and the Japanese army's "human bullet" spirit of not fearing death.

### First Refugee Shelter Has Been Completely Closed

The first refugee shelter of the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association, presided over by Zhang Nairen of Jinfeng Paper Mill, has been completely closed with the utmost dedication. Mr. Zhang hosted a banquet yesterday to thank the people who helped in the society, including Yuan Ludeng, Pan Shu, Wang Ying and other ten people, and handled the follow-up matters in the remaining houses of the paper mill.

### Fires in the Public Concession in April

During the month of April this year, the Fire Department of the Public Concession received a total of 57 alarms, including 48 actual fires, 3 well-intentioned false alarms, 1 malicious false alarm, and 5 special emergency alarms. The estimated value of property located in the Public Concession and Special Tax Area that was damaged by fire was 162,340 yuan and 846,000 yuan respectively, for a total of approximately 1,008,340 yuan. Two people died in the fires, and eight citizens were injured (five from fires and three from special emergency alarms), as well as two Fire Department personnel. The Fire Department ambulance made a total of 175 trips in April, and a total of 219 patients were transported to hospitals.

Yesterday, the newspaper was issued at 6:40 PM

Family

### Talking About My Family Under High Prices

— Zhixin

Talking about my family under high prices, in terms of population, there is my grandmother above, my parents in the middle, and my younger brother below, making a total of seven people. In terms of economics, although it couldn't be said to be wealthy before the war, it was at least enough to be called a "well-off" family. Because the cost of living was low at that time, there was no need to worry about the economic aspect; however, it is different now. Due to the soaring prices of everything and the high cost of living, the family's economy has gradually become strained, especially in terms of "rice," it feels even more stretched and difficult to cope with. Under this situation of "difficult to cope with" economic constraints, we cannot escape life because of economic constraints. People must continue to survive. To survive, we must think of appropriate ways to cope with the difficulties of life and fight for life. Fortunately, all seven members of our family have a spirit of cooperation and are of one mind. At a family meeting, my father, elder brother, and I discussed the family's financial management issues and jointly sought appropriate methods to cope with the difficulties of life. At that time, three financial management principles were decided:

(1) Save on Consumption. In addition to the necessary daily expenses, we should try to save on consumption as much as possible, such as cigarettes and alcohol (my father and elder brother don't smoke or drink, this is for respecting "guests") and entertainment expenses for daily theatergoing; in addition, we should strive for neat and clean clothes, and no new clothes should be added unless necessary. Moreover, people in the family must "walk on foot" when going out and must not take a car casually (long distances are of course an exception), wasting money.

(2) Family Service. All matters in the family should be carried out by each member of the family themselves. Such as embroidery, sewing, and cooking, which are handled by my mother and sister-in-law, and indoor sweeping and other work are handled by my elder brother and me. My father specializes in matters related to external "business" because my father has his own store and is his own boss, so he often has the opportunity to urge and guide us. In short, everyone in the family has their own affairs, and they are only allowed to help each other and not shirk responsibility.

(3) Improve Meals. Implement a system of two congee and one rice, cooking rice with half ordinary rice and half foreign rice (sometimes also mixed with corn), and limiting the amount of rice per person per meal. We should not eat too full or too little, but should "stop when appropriate." Because "dieting" can save the consumption of rice, and on the other hand, it is also a good way to benefit health and hygiene. As for vegetables, eat more cheap foods that are rich in vitamins, such as beans, vegetables, etc.

We have been implementing these three financial management methods for more than a year. Under our faithful implementation of these principles, the results have been very good in the past year. From the monthly "income" and "expenditure" items, there is still a surplus every month. Although the remaining money is very small, accumulation makes abundance, and gathering sand makes a tower. After counting the surplus for a year, the amount is quite considerable.

I say: "Things depend on human effort." As long as people in a family that is economically strained can share weal and woe, be frugal and hardworking, think of ways to solve problems, and fight for life, then life will not be difficult, and the future of the family must be bright. If you don't believe it, you should read the famous French novelist Maupassant's work "The Necklace," which describes how hard-working and frugal a couple is and how they understand the methods of "financial management."

"Rome wasn't built in a day"—as long as we are determined to think of ways to solve problems, the family's economy will not be a problem! This article was originally in the "Economic Weekly" and is now specially reprinted here because it suits the style of this publication.

### Nutritional Problems in the Family

— Hua

In this era of soaring prices, how to buy nutritious food at a very low cost is indeed a current problem. The Youth Association has a nutrition committee, which is promoted by Mr. Hou Xiangchuan, Fu Wenshou, Yu Xinen, etc., and cooperates with the Chinese Medical Association, the Children's Nutrition Promotion Association, etc. This publication will pay close attention to nutrition issues and discuss them in the future.

Not long ago, this publication published an article "Disease Prevention First," but disease prevention still has a bit of a passive meaning. If we can pay attention to the nutritional problems of food, that is a more active and more effective method.

Many people think that to talk about nutrition issues, we must involve economic issues. In fact, this is not the case, because things with many nutritional components are not necessarily expensive. We can give an example to prove it:

Taking the nutrients necessary for the human body—vitamins, iron, calcium, protein, and the calories produced—we can compare half a catty of amaranth (now on the market) with chicken:

Vitamin A Vitamin B Vitamin C Iron Calcium Protein Calories
Amaranth 200 8 125 41 35 3 2
Chicken Slight Slight Slight 14 1 18 3

Therefore, housewives should study nutritional problems when planning their daily food for the whole family. In terms of the various nutrients needed by the body, they can be divided into three categories, namely:

Foods that provide heat and strength. The body must have food to keep it warm, just like a stove needs coal. Foods that provide heat and strength include (a) carbohydrates: starch and sugars obtained from grains, sweet potatoes, etc. (b) fats (c) proteins.

Foods that help growth and repair (a) proteins (b) calcium and phosphorus iodine iron and other minerals (inorganic salts) (c) vitamins

Foods that regulate various work processes in the body and help prevent disease (a) water (b) vitamins—A, B, C, D, etc. (c) other minerals such as calcium, phosphorus, iodine, and iron. This is an outline. We will briefly discuss various foods on a regular basis for the reference of housewives. Children are important members of the family, and children's books are very scarce now, so this publication has specially allocated a little space as a garden for children.

### Talk About Tigers (Common Sense)

— Li

A few days ago, a tiger in a French park died because of illness, and we feel very sorry. Now let's talk about everything about tigers.

Tigers are native to Asia. A hundred years ago, India produced the most, but they were later captured and killed by the British, so there are not as many now as there used to be. Tigers can also be found in the mountainous areas of various provinces in our country. The tigers produced in Siberia are the largest in size, with slightly shorter limbs and reddish fur, which is the best in color.

Tigers are nocturnal. When they sleep, they mostly lie on their backs with their feet facing the sky, leaning against nearby trees or walls. After the sun sets, they come out to look for food. Cattle, deer, deer, and rabbits are all their food. It is said that once they eat human flesh, they will want to eat it every time.

How much do they eat every day? They have to eat eleven or twelve catties of meat every day. Tigers in the zoo are probably fed beef or horse meat every day. Every three or four days, they also have to add three or four catties of chicken, pigeon, and white ghosts to change their taste.

Because they eat raw meat every day, they often have tapeworms or roundworms in their stomachs. (We will also get these kinds of worms if we eat raw meat, so we must be careful.) In the past, the Nanshi Zoo specially prepared cooked meat for them to prevent these kinds of worms, but they didn't want to eat it.

We all know that tigers are very fierce, but if we raise them from a young age and are with them every day, they will be very gentle when they grow up. There is a famous tiger painter, Mr. Zhang Shanzi, who raises several tigers at home.

Children must ask, how many years can a tiger live? A tiger can live about twenty-seven or eight years. I can also tell you the life spans of horses, lions, etc.:

Horse...30 years Sheep...12 years Camel...40 years Cat...13 years Lion...40 years Dog...15 years Elephant...100 years Cow...25 years Turtle...350 years Pig...25 years

### Substitutes for Reed Curtains

— Yingdai

In this era of high rice and expensive firewood and rising prices, we must strive for economy in everything we need in our daily life in order to overcome this difficult time. Hanging reed curtains in the courtyard or outside the windows is no exception. We must consider the economy and save where we can.

It's getting hot, and the south-facing doors and windows are directly exposed to the sun, which increases the temperature of the entire house and is certainly not suitable for living. The only way is to install reed curtains. One afternoon in the spring, I happened to go to a friend's house. He happened to be running a school. When I went there, they happened to be installing reed curtains in the courtyard to avoid the sun's rays shining into the classroom. Out of curiosity, I asked how much it cost to install such a small curtain. According to my friend, it cost more than forty yuan.

This was really unexpected. Such a curtain would not have cost three yuan before the war, but now it costs more than forty yuan. This made me think of using vines and flowers to replace curtains as an economical method. If you plant some vines and flowers in the courtyard, and after a few days, use bamboo, or even things like lead wire and hemp rope, to build a shed, and the flowers and vines are full of the shed, wouldn't that also block the sun? Moreover, it is much more elegant than reed curtains, and the money spent is limited.

Most vines and flowers are seeded at this time, and it will be too late if you are any later. Friends who are concerned about the economy may wish to try it. In this way, when the hot weather comes, a shed of green branches and leaves, and even blooming red flowers, is so beautiful! Moreover, it can also block the sun, so reed curtains are not needed! In addition to using vines and flowers, you can also use awnings to block the sun. Of course, you are not going to buy new fabrics. Sew all the large pieces of old cloth at home that can be used into awnings, which can also be stretched over the courtyard on sunny days to block the sun. That is certainly another way to replace reed curtains. When the price of reed curtains is getting more and more expensive, both of these methods can be adopted. Therefore, I specially wrote it out to introduce it to the readers of this publication.

### One Week Family Menu

— Ms. Hua Ying

The day before yesterday, another reader, Mr. Xu, wrote to ask: Where can I buy yellow croaker for about 15 cents per two ounces? It seems that this price is too cheap to be found. In fact, these yellow croakers have been available in the vegetable market or from fishmongers this week, and one day they were even cheap at 8 to 10 cents per two ounces. Friends who can't eat without meat can indulge themselves. These yellow croakers are quite large. Although they are cheap, each one still costs two or three dollars. However, large yellow croaker can be fried in addition to braising and cooking with vinegar. Coat with flour and a little baking soda, and add some chopped green onions for a crispy and delicious treat. You can also make yellow croaker soup with amaranth, which is also suitable for large yellow croaker. Amaranth is much cheaper than when it first came on the market, so you can buy a lot.

### Lifelike Animals on the Wall

— Wen

Originally Hand Shadows

This is a family game with a touch of science. Not only can naive and clever children learn about the cause of solar eclipses, but with considerable practice, new tricks can be created, making it a truly enjoyable activity.

This type of game is very easy to play because both hands do not require external help, and a bright lamp and a white wall or a clean white cloth are also easy to find. Apart from these, no other tools are needed.

When playing, both hands must be placed between the lamp and the wall or projection surface, and the direction must be paid attention to. The attached picture shows shadows of fifteen kinds of animals, with very similar shapes and vaguely recognizable faces. Children will definitely like them when they see them and will learn them quickly. However, to project shadows that are lifelike, you must pay attention to the position of the hands in the picture and practice a lot.

After the projected shadows look real, you should go a step further and make them lively. The so-called lively means how to move your fingers to make them look like they are eating, foraging, cocking their ears, or bending their knees, etc. If you can also imitate the sounds of each animal at the same time, such as dog barking, bird chirping, wolf howling, etc., it will be like icing on the cake, making it even more vivid and interesting.

By making various different postures with both hands, you can project countless kinds of animals or other things. If children don't believe it, they might as well try it.

### Napoleon and Maternal Education

— Li

Napoleon once said to his wife: The old education method is of little value. What should be done to give people a proper education? His wife said: There is nothing else, only maternal education. Napoleon pondered for a moment and said: You are right. This can be said to summarize the entire education system in one sentence. I know that education starts with children, and the education of children belongs to the mother.

### Spot Cash Soars to Dizzying Heights, Reaching a Maximum of $35,000

Yesterday, the spot cash gray market continued its frantic upward trend, with prices breaking through the $30,000 mark. Confidence remained strong from all sides, mainly due to the soaring "Hua Tou" premiums and the rise of military notes, with wealthy buyers willing to pay high prices just to acquire them. Since the morning, each bar (ten taels) opened high at $29,300 in a buying frenzy, $4,000 higher than the afternoon closing price of the previous day, and $1,800 higher than the morning price. A securities firm, acting on behalf of Tianjin interests, aggressively sold, causing buyers to back down, retreating $900 to $28,400. Another securities firm, along with a gold shop and a bank, repeatedly absorbed the supply. After 9:30 AM, an upward surge erupted, rising $1,750 to reach an unprecedented high of $30,150. Two gold shops and a securities firm dumped their holdings to limit losses, pulling the price back down to $29,700 at the close, $4,400 higher than the previous day's closing price, and $2,200 higher than the afternoon price. Soon after, there were buyers at $29,900, and it was rumored that there were buyers for Hua Tou premiums at $11.30. By noon, the price had risen to $31,500, with brisk trading. In the afternoon, it soared again to $35,000. Finally, there were sellers at $34,000, and buyers at $33,500.

Jewelry shops across the board raised the price of gold jewelry by $500 per tael to $3,200 (purchases at a discount of slightly more than $200). Silver was marked up by $2 to $20. The black market price has risen to $17.50. Silver coins were priced at $10.05 per yuan, but despite the sharp rise, there were no reported transactions.

### Military Note "Hua Tou" Premium Reaches $11

Reserves Sold at $2.10

Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw both British and American pounds rise by $50, with the former rising to $610 and the latter to $620. US dollar notes rose to $41 or $42, and Hong Kong notes rose to around $6. The military note "Hua Tou" premium opened at $10 and gradually rose to $11.30, a sharp increase of $2.40 from the previous day. Cash purchases were at $9.50 or $9.60.

Yesterday, the Money Trade Association kept the call loan rate at 15 cents. The discount rate for "Hua Tou" notes rose from $115 per thousand to $150, an increase of $45. The premium for reserve notes rose from $2.00 to $2.30 per yuan, with cash purchases at $1.90 and sales at $2.10.

### Bank Clearing House Supplies Cash to Fellow Banks

Adjusting for Shortage of Single Notes; Reissuing One-Yuan Old Notes The discount on "Hua Tou" notes in this city has been rising sharply in recent days, with the highest rate yesterday requiring a discount of $1,500 per $10,000, meaning that $10,000 in cash could be exchanged for $11,500 in "Hua Tou" notes. The United Banks Clearing House, in view of the resurgence of the "Hua Tou" premium, decided to provide cash again to adjust for the needs of fellow banks. Except for the money shops, which will continue to be supplied by the Clearing House through the Money Trade Reserve, without direct dealings with the shops, all banks that have dealings with the Clearing House can, according to the amount of exchange determined by the Clearing House each time on the following dates, issue a transfer application or check for "Hua Tou" current account, and exchange cash twice with the Clearing House at the flat rate, which will be debited to the cash account of each bank.

First time: From May 25th to 30th

Second time: From June 1st to 10th

It is heard that the Clearing House stipulates that the amount of cash exchange for each bank ranges from $100,000 to several hundred thousand dollars, so the "Hua Tou" premium rate next Monday is expected to be lowered.

Furthermore, the Clearing House yesterday sent a circular to all banks and shops, stating that there has recently been a shortage of one-yuan banknotes in the market. Therefore, starting from today, the one-yuan notes that have been exchanged into the Clearing House due to damage will be returned to the original deposit banks and shops according to the original signatures. Each bank should sort them out and select the more complete ones for circulation. All banks and shops that extract old one-yuan notes from the Clearing House should issue a transfer application or check for the current account based on the currency account at the time of deposit and collect them from the Clearing House.

### Public Bonds Forge Ahead

Yesterday's public bond gray market saw enthusiastic buying from various groups, and the price increase was extremely rapid. There were no major sellers. After the opening, there was a brief pause before the price rose again, forcing up the price by one dollar before pausing slightly and then rising again. This kind of rise was indeed expected. The previous one-sided decline was mostly absorbed by the financial community, and now it is clear that the powerful faction can defeat the spot goods faction. In the current environment, the abnormal and frantic rise of all commodities is why public bonds are no exception. The sharp rise in the past two days has mostly restored the inherent normal state. Types B and C have both reached the $60 mark. Even if there are sales in the future, it may not be easy to suppress the high morale and strength. Yesterday, Tong Kang, Da Zhong, and Zi Kang bought in very eagerly, sparing no effort. Qian Yi, Jiu Feng, Hong Xing, Run De, Cheng Kang, Xie Kang, Ren Chang, Yi Ji, and Tong Li sold aggressively. There were also general retail investors, absorbing even more enthusiastically. On the selling side, Tong Shun, Yong Kang, Hu He Ji, Yi Tai, Yu Da, Shun Tai, Xin Hua, Xin Ji, Heng Fu, Le Mao, Lian Yi, and Xin Feng supplied, mostly to cash in profits. As a result, the market price of each bond rose uniformly by $2.20 to $3.70, with a turnover of approximately $1.8 million to $1.9 million. A brief table is listed below: Category Highest Lowest Closing Compared to the previous day Unified Type A 65.70 63.90 65.70 Up $2.60 Unified Type B 60.30 58.50 60.00 Up $3.70 Unified Type C 60.00 57.00 60.00 Up $3.50 Unified Type D 53.50 51.00 53.50 Up $3.30 Unified Type E 55.00 52.00 54.40 Up $2.10

### Chinese Stocks Rise Even More Sharply

Yesterday's Chinese stock market saw buyers flocking in due to various factors, forming a situation of short supply. Wing On Company rose by $3 to $72.50, Sincere by $5.50 to $81, and China Underwear by $3 to $24.50. Yi Lin Color Printing was bought at $107, and Commercial Press at $260. World (New) rose by more than $11 to $110. China rose to $155, and Guanshengyuan (Old) rose by $10.50 to $217.50, while (New) rose by $15 to $265. Pharmaceutical stocks rose particularly sharply, with China-England rising by $20 to $190, China-France (New) rising by $8 to $76, New Asia (New) rising by $3.50 to $44.50, and Biochemical rising by $3.50 to $31. Dasheng Factory rose to $100, and Da Han Pharmaceutical Factory rose to $120, all reaching new high prices.

### Yarn Prices Are Also Firm and Unparalleled

The spot market for cotton yarn remained excellent. This was because the premium on reserve notes continued to rise, leading to good sentiment and strong buying interest. 42-count Blue Phoenix was priced at $18,300 to $18,650, 42-count Water Moon at $17,300, 42-count Li Ma at $17,650, 42-count Yang He at $17,500, 60-count New Globe at $31,400, 60-count New Sunlight at $29,900, 40-count Sunlight at $17,000, 32-count Xian Tao at $15,900, 32-count Jin Ta at $13,800, 20-count Blue Phoenix at $10,200 to $10,500, 20-count Double Tiger at $9,400, 20-count Yue Qin at $9,800, 20-count Double Horse at $9,400 to $9,450, 10-count Red Double Horse at $7,500, 10-count Boy Scout at $7,380, 10-count Golden Bridge at $7,200, 10-count Deli at $7,100. The opening price of 20-count Double Horse factory orders immediately rose to $9,105. Subsequently, due to the factory's large and massive sales, it fell to $8,800 at the close, but after the market closed, prices outside the market continued to rise, with transactions at $9,100.

### Cotton Cloth Extremely Fluctuating; Market in Short Supply

Affected by currency fluctuations, cloth prices have been jumping erratically, and sentiment is extremely uneasy. The upward trend shows no sign of stopping. Yesterday, the price of both coarse and fine cloth rose by more than $20 per bolt. 16-pound Earth coarse cloth was priced at $350, rising to $360, with demand exceeding supply. Fei Hong coarse cloth was priced at $350. 12 Earth fine cloth opened at $330 in the morning, and the trading price in the afternoon was $340. The final asking price was $345. 11-pound Fugui fine cloth was priced at $335. Peach Blossom Muslin opened at $448 in the morning and closed at $464 in the afternoon. Buying was brisk in the afternoon. Even though it was Saturday and there was no market, people were still searching for it, with transactions at $470. Longevity Fuchou was priced at $11, and Changting at $10.07.

The East Cloth market followed the usual practice of doing business for half a day, and the prices of various cloths also continued to rise. New orders for Longtou fine cloth opened at $404, fell back to $397, buyers surged in, and then created a new high price, closing at $413 at noon. On Monday, it was priced at $416. Mid-range Colorful Ball was priced at $369, an increase of about $14 or $15 per bolt. Four Gentlemen Serge opened at $15, fell to $14.75, and rose to $15.20 at noon, an increase of 45 cents per yard.

### Amidst Drastic Currency Changes, Wheat Bran Soars

Red Beans and Bean Cakes Also Rise

Trading in beans was mediocre yesterday, but sentiment was firm due to the stimulus of finance. The price of red beans suddenly increased by $10, and broad beans and soybeans were also priced higher. The details are as follows: 90 bags of Chongming sand red beans were sold, with a price of $230 to $233 delivered. Another 140 bags of sand broad beans were priced at $140 to $145 ex-warehouse. 500 bags of Nanjing cowpeas were priced at $232.

Yesterday's corn market was stable. It is estimated that two cars of Wuhu corn were sold, with a price of $180 to $182 ex-warehouse.

Yesterday, bean cakes still had investors hoarding, but actual sales were lackluster, so the market rose first and then leveled off. The market price was generally $3 or $4 higher than before. The details are as follows: 1,000 pieces of Lizi cake for the March new warehouse receipt were priced at $79 to $80. Another 1,500 pieces of the May new warehouse receipt were priced at $80 to $82. 2,000 pieces of the Shengji cake for the June old warehouse receipt were priced at $67.50 to $68.50. Another 500 pieces of the July old warehouse receipt were priced at $69. Another 500 pieces of the October Fen warehouse receipt were priced at $69. Another 500 pieces of the March new warehouse receipt were priced at $82. Another 500 pieces of the April new warehouse receipt were priced at $74 to $77.

The increase in wheat bran was even stronger, because the Central Reserve notes were shrinking frequently, and sentiment was greatly encouraged. The price increased sharply by $15 or $16. Yesterday, it was sold that 600 bags of Sanxin small-packed wheat bran for the end-of-month warehouse receipt were priced at $133 to $138.

### Sugar Stocks Rise Steadily

Due to the soaring military notes, the price of sugar continued to rise. At the same time, sugar stocks also soared. For example, crude white stock rose directly from $470 or $480 to $520, and red sugar reached a maximum of $560, all unprecedented high prices.

### Pangolin Scales Loosen

Because no pangolin scales have arrived for a long time, the market supply is extremely scarce, and the market price has risen by $100 or $200, reaching an unprecedented high. Recently, due to relatively weak sales, there has been a slight loosening. Yesterday, the market selling price was reduced by about $100 compared to before.

### Daily Necessities Are Searched for Extensively

Gu Ben Soap Rises by $40 At a Stroke The prices of daily necessities are also rising rapidly, because all parties are making every effort to acquire actual goods, and most have turned from selling to buying, so the market is in short supply. Gu Ben soap was priced at $465, a sharp increase of $40 from the previous day. Bai Xiang Mao soap was priced at $370, Huang Xiang Mao soap was priced at $340, and Arrow Knife soap was priced at $350, all rising by more than $10. Phoenix brand matches were priced at $6,400, American brand at $8,500, and miscellaneous brands at $5,400, also continuing to rise by $300 from the previous day. The prices of various goods are quite tight.
