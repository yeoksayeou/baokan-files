### Further Discussion on the Grain Problem

In our editorial on the 10th, this newspaper elaborated on the severity of the grain problem and its economic and political impact, offering several suggestions to the authorities. In recent days, the severity of the grain problem has not diminished. For the sake of the people's daily lives and social stability, we cannot ignore this issue.

We believe that the authorities have a profound understanding and far-sighted vision of the grain problem at this time. That is to say, the authorities will certainly be able to implement a grain policy that meets the needs of promoting the Greater East Asia War through Sino-Japanese cooperation, while also taking into account the minimum living standards of the people of this country. For the sake of the war—especially the Greater East Asia War—our friendly nation Japan has not only met the current needs of the war, but has also prepared to meet the needs of a protracted war, and has long implemented the "Outline of the New Agricultural System" to establish a permanent foundation for grain production increase. Moreover, under the policy of grain distribution control and national management, it has been observed by the people of the whole country and has maintained grain satisfaction. China is an agricultural country, a famous "granary of East Asia." For the sake of practicing "Sino-Japanese cooperation," it is natural that we must share the responsibility of supplying a portion for the Greater East Asia War. Cooperation on grain should naturally be one of the practical steps of material cooperation. At the same time, as the ancients said, "The people are the foundation of the state, and when the foundation is solid, the state is secure." We sincerely hope that the authorities will, in principle, ensure that cooperation with Japan and ensuring the people have enough food are both taken into account, and that they will accept the opinions of all sectors of society and alleviate the suffering of the people. Because only in this way can we concentrate financial resources and ensure the smooth implementation of the entire grain policy.

We must not stand idly by in the face of the very serious grain problem at present. We must immediately rise up and jointly seek a temporary solution. We would also like to extend our sincere hope to all sectors of Shanghai. First of all, we hope that the municipal chamber of commerce, various trade associations, and baojia heads will assist the authorities in devising reasonable solutions to increase the source of grain and stabilize the price of grain, especially the price of miscellaneous grains, which should be stabilized as soon as possible. Secondly, this newspaper hopes that readers will report the actual situation as much as possible, or propose good solutions—whether comprehensive or partial—this newspaper will do its best to publish them within its capabilities, in order to gather wisdom and solve this problem.

### American Giant Troop Carrier Sinks in South Pacific; Axis Submarine Activity Expands Range; United States Announces Navy Casualty Statistics

Lisbon, 13th, Allied News Agency: According to dispatches from Washington, the U.S. Navy Department issued a communique yesterday stating that the American giant mail ship "President Coolidge" (21,936 tons) recently carrying 4,000 soldiers, struck a naval mine and sank while sailing in the South Pacific. This ship was a newly built luxury merchant ship of the President Lines, which was requisitioned for military use at the beginning of the war. Its sinking occurred within the past two weeks, and it was fully loaded with troops and military supplies at the time, it said.

Berlin, 13th, Allied News Agency: According to the German military authorities, since September, German submarines in the West Indian Ocean have sunk as many as 40 anti-Axis ships.

Berlin, 12th, Allied News Agency: According to dispatches from Cape Town, the South African Federal Government recently felt threatened by the unpredictable appearance of Axis submarines in the waters off the east coast of South Africa. New defense measures are being taken. In addition to increasing reconnaissance aircraft and bombers for patrol, old-fashioned warships have also been dispatched to serve as guards. However, these new measures have not had any effect, and Cape Town's external communications have become more obstructed. Ships engaged in the transportation of war materials and food cannot set sail without the protection of cruisers and destroyers. The South African Federal Government is extremely concerned about this. It is extremely difficult to maintain aerial vigilance in the waters near East Africa, but the government has recently paid special attention to this. The maritime security waters of the South African Federal Government are now planning to extend to the coast of Mozambique. According to informed sources in Cape Town, two armored divisions with tanks are currently on standby in South Africa, and will move to the vicinity of the new security waters as soon as orders are issued, it is said. This is a clear indication that the Anglo-American invasion of Portuguese East Africa is imminent.

Lisbon, 13th, Allied News Agency: According to news from Washington, the U.S. Navy Department has just released the 18th casualty list, which contains the names of 1,613 naval personnel killed and wounded from November 16th to 30th, including 546 deaths, 660 wounded, and 407 missing from naval battles, marine corps, and coast guard defense forces. The total number of U.S. Navy personnel killed and wounded since December 7th last year has reached 18,836 to date.

Lisbon, 13th, Allied News Agency: According to reports from Montreal, Canadian Minister of Munitions Howe admitted that the ships lost by the Allies since the beginning of the war are more than double the tonnage of the ships they have built to replace them.

### With the Rainy Season Approaching in Tunisia, Axis Forces Switch from Defense to Offense; British Offensive in Western Cyrenaica Ultimately Unsuccessful; Rommel's Troops Hold Favorable Positions

Berlin, 13th, Allied News Agency: According to reports received here, the Axis forces on the Tunisian front have switched from defense to offense. After occupying Tabarka, a strategic point on the border between Tunisia and Algeria, they continued to attack along the Kebir River. Another Axis force also attacked from Taburbah west of Tunis towards Medjez el Bab, launching a large-scale encirclement operation against the Anglo-American forces. It is expected that the Anglo-American attempt to occupy Tunisia will be thwarted before the rainy season, as the incessant rain in Tunisia has made the roads muddy and made combat difficult.

Lisbon, 12th, Allied News Agency: According to frontline reports received here, the Tunisian front has been experiencing incessant heavy rain for several days, which has greatly hindered combat for both Axis and anti-Axis forces. Therefore, the war situation is in a stalemate. However, in the Medjez el Bab area south of Tabarka and southwest of Taburbah, fierce tank battles continue between the Axis and anti-Axis forces in the rain. The Axis forces in that area are operating with the aim of attacking eastward from the south of Tabarka, adopting a semi-circular offensive to join forces with the troops attacking from the Medjez el Bab area in the Teboursouk area to encircle the main force of the anti-Axis forces. At the same time, in order to expand the attack route and allow the troops to attack along the Medjerda Valley into the intermediate point of Bizerte, the main force has been concentrated in the hills near Medjez el Bab, and paratroopers have been landed one after another in an attempt to ensure a superior force. Although the fighting is currently local, both sides are making every effort to seize strategic strongholds and are also striving to increase their forces.

Berlin, 13th, Allied News Agency: Last night, people here claimed that the British Eighth Army, commanded by General Montgomery, launched an offensive yesterday in the El Agheila area of western Cyrenaica, but was immediately countered by Rommel's German forces, suffering heavy losses and retreating. The British first attacked in the coastal area of Marsa Brega, and then attacked in the southern area, but were repelled by the Axis forces without gaining anything. According to the German news agency, the British launched an attack at dawn yesterday, first using artillery to bombard, and then sending some infantry along both sides of the coastal highway to advance towards the positions of the German and Italian tank teams. The British infantry, consisting of several regiments and several special tank teams, repeatedly charged, attempting to clear the way westward. After several hours of fierce fighting, the British suffered heavy losses and the attack collapsed. At noon, the British commander decided to use tank teams to attack in the southern area in an attempt to break through the Axis lines. Some British teams broke into a narrow area, but German tanks, aided by heavy artillery, launched a fierce counterattack, forcing the British tanks to retreat and suffering heavy losses. The British army left behind several destroyed and burned tanks in front of the German lines. The Axis forces also captured some British soldiers and seized a large number of war equipment. In the afternoon, British General Montgomery sent another new tank division to fight in the area. The fighting was still ongoing at the time of dispatch. Regarding the strength of the British army in western Cyrenaica, the news agency said that it is now known that the British Eighth Army has two tank and infantry divisions on the front line, and is also transferring other troops from the Egyptian and Libyan borders and the coastal highway between Benghazi and El Agheila to the front line.

Stockholm, Sweden, 13th, Haitong News Agency: According to news from London, General Rommel may retreat from El Agheila to a more favorable position. British military figures believe that the purpose of the German defense of El Agheila is to stop the advance of the British Eighth Army and cover the preparations for a more favorable position.

Axis Forces Dominate the Air; Anglo-American Paratroopers Annihilated

Tangier, 13th, Haitong News Agency: A dispatch from Algiers, Reuters' correspondent in North Africa admitted that the Axis side holds air superiority on the Tunisian front. General Eisenhower will continue to be subjected to intensified bombing by the Axis air force. The correspondent also said that the Allied forces' supply is very difficult, while the Axis side is using war equipment and reinforcements to continuously send troops to the Tunisian front, which shows the convenience of their transportation.

Rome, 13th, Haitong News Agency: A correspondent from the Roman People's Daily in Tunis reported that Anglo-American paratroopers landed near Tunis. It took three days to encircle and annihilate them. The British paratroopers resisted fiercely, while the American paratroopers hardly resisted and surrendered. One team of British paratroopers, about 600 men, fought fiercely with the Axis forces, but their retreat route was cut off, and their resistance was in vain. As a result, 210 surviving paratroopers, including 29 officers, surrendered to the Italian side.

### Allied Forces Greatly Gained Fleets; Frequent Entry and Exit in the Mediterranean

Lisbon, 13th, Allied News Agency: According to reports received here today, a large Allied convoy, consisting of 36 cargo ships and many warships and torpedo boats, sailed out of the Mediterranean yesterday and headed towards the Atlantic. At the same time, another fleet was seen entering the Mediterranean.

### Anglo-American Aircraft Bomb French and Italian Cities

Annassey City, France, 12th, Havas: The city of Annassey in the Upper Savoy province was bombed by British aircraft. Five people were killed and several were injured. The details were announced by the authorities as follows: At 8:30 p.m. yesterday, several British aircraft appeared over the area and dropped flares, followed by several explosions. Many incendiary bombs fell in the city center, but there was no loss. Many bombs also fell on a nearby mountain, and fires broke out in several forests. Many houses in the city were damaged, and the doors and windows of most shops were destroyed. The streets in the bombed areas were littered with bricks and tiles.

Bern, Switzerland, 12th, Havas: London reports that the British Air Force bombed the Italian city of Turin again yesterday, but due to bad weather, only a few bombs hit their targets. The British side admitted to losing three aircraft.

### Before and After the War: A Record of Ambassador Nomura's Visit (2)

— Saji Sanji Takahashi

Translated from the December 13th issue of "Shukan Mainichi"

(Question) In that case, did they intend to use some new weapons to attack Japan?

(Answer) There were many such instances. For example, manufacturing airplanes capable of flying in the high stratosphere. Once such aircraft are made, they could appear over the Japanese mainland and carry out air raids. Furthermore, in view of the great effectiveness of German submarines, the enemy United States has also begun building a large number of submarines, attempting to hinder the transport of materials within Japan's Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. The enemy clearly sees that once Japan's Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere is completed, the abundant resources and products of the South will fall entirely into Japanese hands, the consequences of which are unthinkable. Therefore, they must use submarines to crush the establishment of the Co-Prosperity Sphere. The sudden shift in the US military focus lies in this. This is also something we cannot ignore.

(Question) Could you elaborate on the subsequent expansion of American production capacity?

(Answer) In terms of planning, it is very impressive. And in terms of implementation, they have also made considerable progress. The manufacture of all non-essential goods, such as furniture, razors, and ice makers… has been prohibited. Automobile factories capable of producing millions of cars have now been converted into aircraft manufacturing plants. They are also doing everything they can to build ships. I heard from influential figures in both political parties that to win the war, the entire country must unite and transform the aforementioned industrial sectors into organizations like those of the Nazis or Fascists. They are guiding the people in this way... Once the war starts, they must win it to the end, whether it is a long-term war or a short-term war...

(Question) Compared to America's determination, what is the morale of Japan? Our country's production capacity is far inferior to that of the United States. I believe this inferiority should be compensated for with morale, right?

(Answer) Yes. My first impression after returning home was that the people seemed relatively gloomy, that is, they were slacking off and being negligent. You can see this situation simply by walking around on the street. The enemy United States suffered a major defeat in the initial battles, which was also due to negligence. We can no longer deceive ourselves and continue to be negligent. The enemy is not so easy to deal with. This war is also a matter of life and death for them. Negligence is absolutely forbidden. Morale must be further boosted. To defeat America decisively, a surge in morale is the most important thing.

A defeated mindset is absolutely unacceptable. The enemy is powerful, but we have an even greater power that they do not possess. We should not dream of cheap victories. We must be prepared to "fight to the last drop of blood." All one hundred million citizens must unite, do their best in their respective positions, and advance towards the path of victory!

(Question) What does the Ambassador feel is regrettable?

(Answer) It is the safety of the 300,000 overseas Chinese in the United States. Diplomats must withdraw to their home countries, which is the consistent policy of the United States. As a diplomat, I returned with great pain. However, when I think of the 300,000 overseas Chinese who are struggling to make a living under the enemy's surveillance, I cannot help but feel deeply disturbed. I remember that on the way to my assignment, I was welcomed by fellow countrymen in every possible way. At that time, I said to everyone: "The negotiations between Japan and the United States must succeed. Your hardships must be relieved." This war is entirely the fault of the enemy United States. The suffering of the overseas Chinese is also the fault of the enemy. In the depths of night, I always secretly feel sorry for those overseas Chinese.

(Question) Were there any interesting anecdotes during the Japan-U.S. negotiations? I would like to hear one or two.

(Answer) My and Hull's straw hats were very similar, but mine was much newer. Once, after meeting with Hull, I mistakenly took his old one. Later, Hull said to me, "It's common to take the better one by mistake, but it's rare to take my old hat." Even during such important negotiations, our meetings were still quite humorous. The average American who doesn't know the inside story doesn't know who is to blame for the war. They always say, "Nomura keeps asking to see us, he's really shameless." Only I know the joys and sorrows of this. I always feel that between heaven and earth, I am conducting a very honorable negotiation. (Translated by Qian Mu)

### Fighting on Four Fronts in Stalingrad; German Forces Launch Powerful Counteroffensive; Soviet Troops Under Tolobeev Encircled

Allied News Agency, Lisbon, 13th—According to Reuters dispatches received here today, German forces have launched a powerful counteroffensive southwest of Stalingrad and east of Verkhne-Chirskaya. Fighting has occurred on at least four fronts in Stalingrad yesterday. German forces have repeatedly changed their direction of attack. As of late last night, fighting was still in progress. In the Verkhne-Chirskaya region, German forces have been attacking continuously with the assistance of tanks and heavily armored units yesterday and this morning in an attempt to seize key positions in this area.

Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 13th—Continued fierce fighting is occurring on the Eastern Front. The fiercest battles are taking place in the central sector of the Soviet Ninth Army under Zhertovskiy and Tolobeev in the Don River bend, between the Don and Volga Rivers, and in the Stalingrad area. The Soviet forces in the central sector have suffered heavy losses from German attacks. On the third day of fighting, the Soviet forces lost a total of 170 tanks. The Soviet command's operational plan to establish contact with the Tolobeev forces has failed. The Soviet forces encircled in the Tolobeev area have been divided into three groups by the German forces and are currently being annihilated. Soviet forces launching flanking attacks on the Don River front have been repulsed. Soviet offensives south of Stalingrad have also failed. The Soviet command has now abandoned its attempt to reinforce the front line with troops and supplies from the Volga River.

### Britain and the U.S. Exert Themselves to Win Over Turkey; Turkish National Assembly Passes Military Credit Loan Bill

Central News Agency, Berlin, 13th—The efforts of Britain and the United States to win over Turkey have become increasingly blatant recently. They are using huge amounts of propaganda funds to incite anti-Axis sentiment among the Turkish people through shortwave radio, newspapers, and magazines. The British Fifth Column has also infiltrated Ankara and Istanbul and is making every effort to launch diplomatic offensives. According to sources in Ankara close to the British and Americans, the American ambassador to Turkey recently submitted a major proposal to the Turkish Foreign Minister, including: 1. The United States and Great Britain jointly guarantee that the Soviet Union will not invade Turkey; 2. Recognize Turkey's leading position in West Asia; 3. British and American aid to Turkey's defense; 4. Supply of food and new-style armaments. Neutral countries believe that Turkey will certainly not be induced by Britain and the United States to abandon its neutral stance, and that the so-called supply of armaments and food is nothing more than an empty promise. Britain and the United States have absolutely no possibility of threatening Turkey with force. However, the British and American strategies towards Turkey will become more active in the future, as they must make every effort to consolidate the defense of West Asia and obtain a base for disrupting the Balkans. Turkey has always maintained its neutrality by balancing the power of the Axis and the British and American forces. In the future, it will inevitably enter a dilemma due to the increasingly tense situation in the surrounding areas. The staging of Turkey's tragedy, and the changes in the situation in the Mediterranean, North Africa, West Asia, and the Caucasus around Turkey, are all matters of great concern to the world.

Haitong News Agency, Istanbul, 13th—The Turkish National Assembly has now passed the government's bill to issue a military credit loan of 10 million Turkish pounds. At the same time, it is discussing amendments to the election law, stipulating that Turkish citizens who marry foreigners will be deprived of their voting rights.

Havas News Agency, Berlin, 12th—German political circles are paying close attention to the impending visit of Spanish Foreign Minister Jordana to Lisbon. Semi-official German dispatches state that Spain and Portugal must jointly review certain political and economic issues and that it is only natural to seek mutual cooperation to resolve them in order to avoid certain crises. All of this is fully understood by Germany. Furthermore, German political figures are well aware that both Spain and Portugal are suffering from the hardships of the maritime blockade, and they cannot ignore reports from across the Atlantic that Spain and Portugal could become the targets of political and military activities. It is reasonable and natural for them to exchange views with each other.

### The Suffering of Honest Merchants in the Mainland: Subjected to Pickiness and Obstruction by Various Tax Collection Agencies; Inspection of Goods Between Jiangxi and Hunan is Particularly Complicated

In the mainland, because prices are soaring, most people are burdened by the heavy weight of life and are severely scolding unscrupulous merchants, believing that the price surge is entirely due to the actions of unscrupulous merchants. Indeed, there is an inseparable relationship between prices and unscrupulous merchants. However, in practical terms, the so-called unscrupulous merchants must have a scope. Although unscrupulous merchants are also merchants, it does not mean that all merchants are unscrupulous. Generalizing is not fair.

Two Types of Merchants

One type is the honest, law-abiding merchant, and the other is the counterfeit merchant who borrows power and influence. The characteristics of counterfeit merchants are: First, they have money, power, and all kinds of conveniences to manipulate the market, control prices, smuggle, evade taxes, and rely on their power to do so. Second, they have the reality of a merchant but not the name of a merchant; they can evade all the obligations that a merchant should have. Third, they have their own social status, so they use power or official convenience to develop their business. Fourth, since they are not formal merchants, they do not rely on this for a living, so they can hoard large quantities of goods and exchange time for profit. Fifth, since their operations have no fixed position and do not reveal their tracks, illegal activities are not easily punished by law.

As for honest, law-abiding merchants, the situation is very different. First, their capital is their property, and their property is what they rely on for a living. Although they also buy and sell goods, waiting for prices to rise, they cannot exchange time for profit like unscrupulous merchants. If their funds are completely frozen, they will have no way to make a living. Second, they have no power or influence in society. They rely entirely on investing capital to seek profit. Any gains come from hard work, with little trickery or convenience. Third, they must strictly abide by the law. As citizens or merchants, they cannot evade any obligations they owe to the public. Fourth, they seek to trade goods for a small profit, hoping to be in harmony with others and never create trouble. Fifth, transportation is inconvenient, transportation is difficult, risks are high, suffering is great, and unexpected losses are difficult to predict.

The Suffering of Honest Merchants

Honest, law-abiding merchants do not have the characteristics of counterfeit merchants, so it is naturally difficult for them to compete in business. Honest merchants often complain to the media about various sufferings. Unscrupulous elements in general tax collection agencies use the merchants' various weaknesses to engage in pickiness and obstruction. The issue of fines without receipts is even more common. Secondly, the tax collection agencies are complex, the tax collection systems are divergent, the central government and local governments are different, and provinces A and B are different. For example, on the 650-kilometer highway in Jiangxi Province, there are two unified inspections. At the Jiangxi-Hunan border, there is one unified inspection. On the 235-kilometer highway in Hunan Province, there are as many as eleven inspections. Tax collection divisions are a good system, but being too complicated causes merchants to suffer and easily breeds corruption. As for tax collection agencies, there are even more various names. Sometimes tax tickets from a tax bureau in province A are picked on and obstructed by province B. Under the pressure of heavy losses, in order to preserve their capital, merchants naturally increase the price of goods, so how can prices not rise?

An Example

An honest merchant used a car to transport goods from Yingtan, Jiangxi, to Hengyang, Hunan, and reported his experiences along the way. The first inspection was at Yingtan Station; the second was in Ji'an; the third was in Jiehualong. The inspection and tax collection agencies were in the same office, and the situation was still good. Once he entered Hunan Province, the situation was very different. Especially within three kilometers of Chaling, there were as many as five inspection agencies, three of which belonged to the Hunan Regional Tax Bureau of the Ministry of Finance. It is said that in order to strictly enforce tax policy, the tax collection and inspection were separated, so there are so many agencies of the same tax authority. Tax collection agencies were originally stipulated to have no right to inspect, but in fact this is not always the case, so merchants suffer even more. Once he arrived at the east bank of Chaling, he paid the production and sales tax once, and everything was unpacked and inspected. In the chaos, he lost four dozen hemp yarn handkerchiefs. To whom could he complain?

Logically, goods sealed by the Ministry of Finance Tax Bureau should not be opened in the middle to check the details, but this time 13 pieces were opened, resulting in the loss of three dozen "Zebra" socks. When the car arrived at Chaling Station, the stationmaster raised a red flag to block the road, so he had to stop for inspection. It happened to be raining, and the goods unloaded by the roadside got wet. He pleaded with the stationmaster to allow him to inspect them in the station shed, but he was refused and even accused of "tampering with the tax ticket." Wasn't that unjust? Later, after being instructed by others, he admitted to a fine of 1,000 yuan to settle the matter, but did not receive a receipt. The fourth checkpoint was the military police, and the fifth was the Ziyunting Collection Station. The truck passing through here was truly in "deep water and fire." The Direct Tax Bureau of Leiyang also had to register for inspection, and Dongyangdu had a military commission inspection post for inspection. Upon arriving in Hengyang, he had to register for inspection again. Even legal tax tickets were often considered not suitable for separate transportation.

In summary, as mentioned above, the general public should never indiscriminately scold unscrupulous merchants. Counterfeit merchants should certainly be scolded and punished, while truly honest and law-abiding merchants deserve sympathy. The suffering they encounter is often not well understood by the general public.

### Full-Scale Air Raid Defense Resumes Today; Military and Police on Special Alert; Citizens Must Recognize and Act According to the Air Raid Alert; Self-Defense Groups to Hold Special Training

To further train citizens in air raid defense techniques, the second continuous air raid drill, as stipulated by the authorities, will be fully implemented starting today, lasting for ten days. The responsible authorities in the two settlements, Hongkou, Nanshi, Zhabei, Huxi, and other adjacent areas have completed all necessary preparations under the supervision of the Supreme Air Defense Headquarters. During the drill period, all police personnel and self-defense personnel in all areas will be fully mobilized to carry out predetermined or temporarily occurring tasks, and military authorities will closely liaise with police officers to ensure social order and the happiness of the people during the air defense control period.

Air Defense Training Implementation Outline

The purpose of this air defense drill is to create public awareness of air defense, and further cultivate their initiative and promote the strengthening of air defense facilities. The main training items are six: (1) Lighting control methods, including the shielding or reducing of lighting in households, factories, shops, and streets; (2) Sound traffic control, forming a quiet atmosphere during the air defense period and reducing noise; (3) Fire prevention, poison gas prevention, evacuation, and rescue, carried out by the fire brigade, health team, and self-defense personnel in accordance with regulations; (4) Family air defense training, with each family's conscious and automatic air defense measures as the training center; (5) Rapid alarm method, strengthening the efficiency of the alarm and the communication mechanism, so that people can hear the alarm and distinguish the nature of the alarm; (6) Rectify various civil air defense equipment.

Various Police Services Differentiation Methods

Various air raid alarms have been re-specified by the authorities: (1) Alert alarm, one long sound, continuous for 30 seconds; (2) Air raid alarm, several short sounds, each continuous for 5 seconds; (3) All clear alarm, two long sounds, each continuous for 20 seconds. Citizens must pay attention. The all-clear alarm is issued after the air raid alarm, indicating that the air raid alarm has been lifted, but the alert alarm continues to exist. The issuance of all-clear alarms only lifts the previous alarm before the all-clear alarm. It is easy to distinguish the lifting of the air raid alarm and the air defense alert alarm at night, as the signal to lift the air raid alarm is implemented at the same time as the street lights are turned on. However, when the street lights are turned on again after the air raid alarm is issued, it does not mean that the air defense alert alarm has been lifted. In short, the alert alarm must be lifted after the alert alarm is issued.

Prevent Petty Thieves from Stealing on the Opportunity

The police authorities in various districts, in view of the possibility of thefts occurring during the previous air defense drills, have ordered all district police and detectives to step up prevention in order to avoid repeating the same mistake. The role of the self-defense corps or the civil police corps in this work is extremely important, because they are spread all over the area and can easily investigate. Also, air defense thunder lights are hung in each alley, although the light is reduced and the self-defense personnel control their switching on and off, but the air defense lights are not completely extinguished, the intention is to facilitate pedestrians on the one hand, and to prevent thieves from using the darkness to act on the other. The Industrial Bureau's Children's Protection Department believes that air defense drills can create opportunities for thieves to steal clothes from children on the street, and the Information Office has issued a public notice to parents not to let their children go out at will during the air defense period, so as to avoid unfortunate cases such as getting lost or being stolen.

Three Thousand Self-Defense Special Training

In view of the importance of the position of self-defense members in the air defense plan, the authorities have decided to give them special training. In addition to each district organizing its own fire brigade, rescue team, traffic team, and health team, they will also convene 3,000 outstanding self-defense members from each district at 2:00 p.m. tomorrow on Jing'an Temple Road Racecourse Road to practice specialized air defense techniques. Among the drill programs, there is a model house, a performance simulating a fire caused by an incendiary bomb, and the fire brigade rushes to protect and extinguish the fire, while the self-defense personnel assist. This kind of fire extinguishing drill will be held irregularly during the air defense period to give the people a chance to practice. The work of other air defense personnel has also been separately specified by the authorities and implemented accordingly.

Obey Discipline Violators Will Be Severely Punished

The French authorities announced that the French Concession is scheduled to begin passive defense exercises on Monday, December 14, lasting for about ten days. During this exercise period, residents of the concession should absolutely abide by the notice published in the newspaper on October 3 in accordance with the Consular Order No. 178 promulgated on October 2, 1942. This Consular Order punishes anyone who violates the passive defense order with power outages and deportation. During this exercise period, lighting should be strictly shielded, and on-site rescue work will be practiced in various sections of the concession during bombing. The purpose is to make the personnel of the self-defense corps, police station, fire brigade, health department, and engineering department well-trained in this realistic situation. During the exercise, the public should automatically obey discipline so that the work of the rescue and cleaning teams can proceed smoothly.

Air Raid Alert Situation the Day Before Yesterday

In order to improve the efficiency of this exercise, the air defense authorities in the two settlements held a rehearsal the day before yesterday. At 10:40 p.m., an alert alarm was issued, and the lighting in the two settlements was shielded. At 12:40 a.m., an air raid alarm was issued, and the street lights began to go out, immersing the city in darkness. At 2:50 a.m., the main roads in the Old Gate District, such as Nanjing Road, Jiujiang Road, and Hankou Road, were blocked to traffic. At 3:05 a.m., the blockade was lifted, but the alert control continued to exist.

### Japanese Fleet Commander in China Yoshida Returns to Shanghai

### French Concession Identity Cards Issued; Must Be Used from Today

Travelers Must Present Their Cards When Lodging; Pawnshops Should Also Require to View Them

Consul General of France Majorile recently announced, "For the purpose of notification, the identity cards of the French Concession have now been completely issued. From noon on Monday, December 14 this year, the following measures will be implemented: When their guests check in, all hotels and inns must ask them for their identity and residence permits, and in addition to writing their names in a special register, they must also record the number of the permit. If the guest does not have an identity card on their person, they must report it to the police station. From the same day, pawnshops must ask customers for their identity and residence permits (in accordance with Article 4 of Consular Order No. 178 promulgated on June 3 this year, that is, customers must have notarized documents that can prove their identity and address before the pawnshop can accept pledges). Also, when walking in the French Concession, they must carry their identity and residence permits with them, and if asked by police officers, they must present the permit for inspection. The above measures apply to people of all nationalities.

### Must Have Citizen ID to Lodge in a Hotel

The English-language *Shanghai Times* reported that the Public Settlement Police and the French Concession Police simultaneously notified all hotels in the two settlements yesterday that they must record the names and citizen ID numbers of all travelers in the future. It is reported that this measure was first initiated by the YMCA, where all those lodging at the YMCA must fill in their name, nationality, age, reason for lodging, and arrival and departure dates.

### Speculators Continue to Be Arrested

The English-language *Shanghai Times* reported that at 11:00 a.m. on Friday, the Public Settlement Police arrested 364 illegal speculators in the Cotton Yarn Exchange at No. 4, Lane 74, Ningbo Road (Tonghe Lane).

### Xu Daquan Case: Retrial Appeal

Last year, the sensational case in Shanghai that attracted much attention involved Xu Xiangsun, the owner of the Huamei Pharmacy, whose youngest son, Xu Daquan, fatally stabbed his elder brother, Xu Songyao. Xu Xiangsun attempted to conceal Daquan's crime, colluding with corrupt detectives to hide the body in the hospital and replace it with another corpse, falsely claiming that Songyao died from a fall due to lung disease. However, this cover-up failed to deceive the public and was eventually exposed, leading to an investigation by the police, implicating many. Daquan was arrested and prosecuted according to the law. The initial trial sentenced him to ten years in prison. The French Concession authorities disagreed and appealed, but later withdrew the appeal. The Ministry of Justice, upon learning of this, considered the original sentence too lenient, insufficient to deter society and maintain public morals, and ordered the Prosecutor of the Third Branch of the High Court to take on the French Concession authorities' appeal. As a result of the appeal, Xu Daquan's sentence was changed to death. Xu's parents and family were terrified and desperately sought to save Daquan's life, appealing to the Supreme Court. They argued that the second instance procedure was flawed, and the case was remanded to the Third Branch of the High Court for retrial. The French Concession authorities continued to pursue the appeal according to the law. The Third Branch of the High Court held a retrial on the 3rd of this month and again sentenced him to death. The details have already been reported in the newspapers. Although this case has seemingly come to an end, the Xu family's hopes have been dashed. Nevertheless, they still hope to salvage the situation. Therefore, Zhao Xizeng, the lawyer defending Xu, declared an appeal for Xu during the sentencing. Now, he is preparing a written appeal, currently studying the grounds for appeal. Once he receives the retrial judgment, he will submit it to the Supreme Court for review. Whether Xu's life can be preserved depends on the final decision of this retrial appeal.

### Starting with the French Concession Tram Fare Increase

The French Concession tram, starting from the 1st of this month, suddenly announced a fare increase without prior notice, raising the minimum fare for third-class cars from one jiao to two jiao. Since the introduction of the new legal tender in June, the tram fares in both concessions, for the third class, have been one jiao minimum. However, the Public Concession increases the fare by five fen increments, while the French Concession increases it by one jiao increments, making the increase rate higher than that of the Public Concession. Now, while the Public Concession is considering reducing water and electricity prices, the French Concession is raising fares again. This action is suspected of stimulating price increases and deserves attention.

Typically, the French Concession does not publicly announce reasons for price increases for public utilities. For example, the deposit for electric lights was drastically increased during the currency reform. Previously, the deposit for less than fifteen lights was twelve yuan and six jiao, but now it has increased to fifty yuan in Central Reserve Bank notes. Moreover, the method of collection is done selectively, charging each group of fifty households at a time.

In addition, regarding property taxes, starting from January of this year, the French Concession tax office has re-evaluated the rental amounts of taxpayers' properties. The method involves increasing the rental amount from December 1937 by one hundred percent (regardless of whether there was a rent increase or not) and then levying the tax at the original rate of thirty percent. However, this is not noted on the property tax receipts, causing taxpayers to be confused and mistakenly believe that the tax rate has increased, which is not the case.

Such a lack of public explanation for price increases often leads to many abuses. Some rental agents and caretakers take advantage of taxpayers' confusion during rent increases, deliberately not updating the rent receipts with the new rental amount, thereby falsely increasing the tax. At the same time, they charge the tenants half of the property tax increase portion. The tenants, believing they can evade half of the tax amount, gladly comply, unaware that the property tax is based on the new valuation, regardless of whether the rent increased or not, and that they are being deceived.

As a citizen, I hope that the French Concession authorities will publicly explain the reasons for any measures that increase the burden on citizens in the future, so that citizens can understand the intentions of the authorities. (Bai Hong)

### Sugar Merchants Cooperative's Regulations for This Month's Sugar Rationing; Total Amount Increased to 30,000 Bags

The Shanghai Sugar Merchants Cooperative, recognizing that the Lunar New Year is fast approaching and that households have a strong demand for sugar, specifically requested the authorities to increase the rationing quota for this month. The request has been approved for 30,000 bags. The Cooperative has recently obtained a transportation permit and has moved the sugar to be rationed to its various warehouses, where it will distribute it to Type A retailers and Type B users. Once all rationing procedures are completed, a notice will be issued for sugar purchase certificates to be used for payment and collection of goods from designated sugar shops. (1) The sugar obtained by Type A retailers will be sold widely under supervision, following the Cooperative's new sugar sales system, based on property tax receipts or citizen IDs. If sales are conducted daily, they are allowed to sell one-thirtieth of the total daily allocation. If sales are conducted every other day, they are allowed to sell one-fifteenth of the total daily allocation. There are a total of 161 retailers citywide selling sugar based on property tax receipts, as well as several hundred retailers selling based on citizen IDs. The sugar allocated to them accounts for 70% of the total, totaling 21,000 bags. (2) Type B users refer to industries such as biscuit and candy manufacturers, as well as restaurants, for their business needs. All rationed sugar must not be privately sold for profit. Violators will be permanently deprived of the right to rationing. This time, the total allocation for these industries is 30%, totaling 9,000 bags. As for sugar reserves in Shanghai, they are still abundant. The issue of streamlining sources has been resolved satisfactorily, so there is no fear of sugar shortages.

### Tricycle Rental Industry Preparing to Organize a Guild

Scheduled to be established on the 21st of this month.

The tricycle rental business in this city has been quite developed recently.

Attendees included representatives from Shanghai Tricycle (Chuan Xiangxun), China Express (Dai Bingyi), Gongli (Shao Xueji), Xiangsheng (Zhang Kaixun), and Green Treasure (Xu Jianjie). During the meeting, members were selected to draft the articles of association, and it was decided to convene a general meeting on the 21st of this month to formally establish the guild. Discussions were also held on preventing rickshaw pullers from demanding excessive tips. The meeting adjourned at 5:00 PM.

### Record of Rongwu Society's Lecture on the Classics

The 71st lecture on the classics by the Rongwu Lecture Society featured Yang Zhongxuan's study of the Book of Changes, focusing on the symbolism of the transformation of the father's position in the Former Heaven and Later Heaven Bagua. He held a Bagua copper instrument and instructed the audience, advocating for changing customs and traditions. Originally, the Former Heaven Bagua, in order to transform the Xun (wind) and Kun (earth) customs of nighttime behavior, the two trigrams each shifted one position, resulting in the Later Heaven Bagua. In explaining the Former Heaven imagery, he stated, "The study of the Former Heaven originated with Shao Yong of the Song Dynasty. Song Dynasty scholars used the Former Heaven Bagua position imagery, calling it the 'Meaning Image.' The 'Explanation of the Trigrams' states, 'Heaven and Earth are positioned.' Shao Yong believed that this was the order of the Eight Trigrams of Fuxi, a study of the Former Heaven. Zhu Xi respected and adopted it in his 'Elementary Learning Illustration,' while Han scholars of the Ming and Qing dynasties greatly rejected it. Examining the placement of Heaven and Earth, the superior is honored and the inferior is humbled, the sun and moon run their course, rising in the east and setting in the west." Although this represents the principles of the Former Heaven's fixed imagery, it is, in fact, based on old Han Dynasty sayings from the Book of Rites' "Sacrifice Records," which states, "Sacrifices to Heaven are performed at the southern suburbs, sacrifices to Earth are performed at the northern suburbs, at the east gate in the morning, and at the west gate in the evening," its statements resemble the imagery of Qian in the south, Kun in the north, Li in the east, and Kan in the west. Han Dynasty scholars said, "The former kings established rites based on the Book of Changes," demonstrating that the old traditions of Confucius were not established until the Song Dynasty. The "Qian Zao Du" states, "Once Heaven and Earth were separated, Qian ascended and Kun descended," which is the same as the Commentary on the Appended Phrases, "Heaven is honored and Earth is humbled, Qian and Kun are fixed." Therefore, the placement of Heaven and Earth, and the separation of Qian and Kun, represents the so-called fixed imagery of the Former Heaven.

### China Philanthropic Association for Child Welfare Actively Seeking Winter Clothing

Since the Shanghai branch of the China Philanthropic Association for Child Welfare began soliciting winter clothing for impoverished children in the city a few days ago, it has received enthusiastic responses from all sectors. Over 8,000 yuan in donations for winter clothing has already been collected, including 3,000 yuan from Mr. Wu Shaofu of Lichangxing Firm and 1,500 yuan from Mr. Chen Xishi, solicited by Zhao Jinlao. Furthermore, to increase the interest of donors, the Association has specified reward measures: donors of one set of cotton clothing will receive a ceramic commemorative medal; donors of ten sets of cotton clothing will receive a bronze commemorative medal; donors of fifty sets of cotton clothing will receive a silver commemorative medal; and donors of one hundred sets of cotton clothing will receive a framed picture. The Association also stated that for cash donations used by the Association to make new cotton clothing, each set is priced at 20 yuan. According to the Association's Secretary-General, Mr. Yi Bingnan, as the weather is getting colder every day, to ensure that impoverished children receive winter clothing as soon as possible, in addition to intensifying their efforts to solicit donations from all sectors, they are also starting to manufacture winter clothing in advance, so that they can distribute it to children who need it in a timely manner.

### Western Union Football First Division: Donghua Defeats Socarex by a Large Margin; 5 to 1, Half-Time Score 1 to 0

In the Western Union Football First Division match between Donghua and Socarex, played yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM at Jiaozhou Park, Donghua won decisively with a score of 5 to 1. The half-time score was 1 to 0. Donghua was missing Xu Wenkui and Qian Tianjun, and the lineup was slightly adjusted. The Socarex team was very active in the first half, and Donghua's defense was often in danger. Fortunately, the goalkeeper, Banglun, was quick and agile, ensuring no losses. Donghua's forward line lacked connection with the midfield, and there were few opportunities to get the ball. It was not until the 34th minute that Cao Qinfang received assistance from A Dai and scored, giving Donghua a 1 to 0 lead in the first half. After the change of ends, Donghua's momentum increased greatly, and the situation changed. Youliang shot into the right corner. Less than a minute later, Longhai received a pass from A Dai and scored with a ground shot. In the 16th minute, Youliang cut in and scored, and A Dai scored with a header. After Donghua scored three consecutive goals, Socarex counterattacked, and Qialies carried the ball aggressively, hitting Youren's foot and bouncing in, pulling back one goal. Ten minutes later, Qizhongnuo held the ball and took four steps, resulting in a penalty kick. Youliang passed back, A Dai shot with force, and scored again. Donghua won with a score of 5 to 1. Socarex's lineup is as follows:

Donghua Association:

Zhang Banglun

Li Ning, Zhuang Youren

Zhang Zhaopeng, Liang Shutang, Wang Qiansheng

Cao Qinfang, Zhou Jiuzhong, Dai Linjing, Han Longhai, Jia Youliang

### From the Naval Battle of the South Pacific to Tomorrow's Decisive Battle: Interview with Colonel Hirade, Chief of the Navy Press Section of Imperial General Headquarters

— Abe Kenichi, Chief Editor of the Tokyo Daily

(1)

"Translated from the Mainichi Daily, December 13th, Weekday"

Abe: The whole nation is very grateful for the news of the Naval Battle of the South Pacific that your department announced. Such a large naval battle is truly rare in the world!

Hirade: It certainly is rare. First, the United States concentrated such a massive force that it will probably not be possible again in the future. Regarding future construction, they have said this: If ten are bombed, eleven will be built. However, after suffering this defeat, building ships again will be very difficult. In particular, as wireless reporter William Winter declared in San Francisco on the day the Naval Battle of the South Pacific began (the 26th), both Japan and the United States have thrown in all their forces in this battle. Japan has rushed in at great sacrifice, and the United States may be completely defeated. If the United States is fortunate enough to win, it will accelerate its path to victory. If it is unfortunately defeated, then it will probably not be possible to face the Japanese army in a grand formation for several days thereafter.

Abe: This is truly a decisive naval battle!

Hirade: I think that is completely correct. They were defeated in the Pearl Harbor naval battle, and this time they even moved the new fleets launched in the Atlantic. However, the result was still repeated defeats. But during this period, they must still be thinking of revenge. If there is any action, it will probably only be guerrilla naval battles.

Abe: Judging from the United States' countermeasures in the South Pacific, this naval battle can also be said to be part of the second front. But the European second front is far smaller in scale. This naval battle is truly a major decisive battle beyond the second front!

Hirade: In terms of the importance of the battlefront, this is truly the United States' first front.

Abe: A serious decisive battle!

Hirade: It is an important operation. It is by no means secondary. The so-called second front is only from a political or diplomatic point of view. They want to use it to restrain a portion of Japan's forces so that the Soviet Union and Britain can catch their breath. The Importance of the Solomon Islands Naval Battle

Abe: To concentrate a large fleet and a large air force around one location and engage in a major decisive battle for more than three months is truly an amazing feat. Even from the perspective of weapons, it is staggering. This decisive battle will have a great impact on the entire future war situation, not only for Japan but also for the world. In this sense, the Navy's announcement of the results of the battle, and the Army's great efforts, are not just victories in one place and at one time but rather a prediction of our overwhelming victory in the entire war situation, which will dominate the new world order in the future. In this sense, this Naval Battle of the South Pacific has full historical significance.

Hirade: Everyone knows the United States' intentions. One is to use Australia as a foothold to counterattack Japan, and the other is to inherit Australia as a British legacy from Britain. These two points are very important. The more this importance is confirmed, the more the Solomon Islands operations increase in significance. In particular, by creating a strong battle line from the Solomon Islands to the Philippines, that battle line can completely cut off the connection between the Japanese mainland and the resource-supplying South Seas. In this way, Japan will suffer from a lack of war materials and be at a loss. Japan will be forced into the so-called vortex of production warfare. This is a very clever idea on the part of the United States. If this step is successful, it can use the Philippines as a base to further leap to Australia and gradually recapture Japan's occupied territories. As mentioned above, the United States has two intentions. As it stands, it is more focused on the latter, that is, it wants to carry out the recapture of the Solomon Islands on the one hand, and strive to gain control of the sea and air on the other hand, to give Japan a fatal blow. Therefore, as you just said, from Japan's perspective, this naval battle, which will determine the future course of the Greater East Asia War, is particularly meaningful.

The reason why the United States values this naval battle so much is as mentioned above. There is another reason that we cannot ignore. That is, the United States has recently begun to doubt the "personality" of aircraft carriers. After the sinking of the Prince of Wales, known as the "unsinkable battleship," by the Japanese air force, naval authorities and civilian naval experts began to feel that the "circular formation" centered on battleships was vulnerable. Therefore, there are rumors of changing the shipbuilding plan. They want to shift the focus to large air force units. However, it is too bad if aircraft carriers are sunk one after another as they were this time. Aircraft carriers are no good, battleships are no good. If there is an air base, it will not be sunk forever, right? So, the thought arose. There are hundreds and thousands of islands in the Pacific Ocean. Using these islands as replacements for aircraft carriers would truly become "unsinkable aircraft carriers" in name and in fact. With this in mind, the islands in the South Pacific have become very important bases.

Abe: In terms of personnel deployment on the US side, that is, the deployment of the Navy, I hear that it is centered on Air Force personnel. Is this true?

Hirade: We saw the personnel changes announced by the United States a few days before the outbreak of this naval battle. Vice Admiral Ghormley was removed from his post and replaced by Halsey, the commander of the Air Force. In short, the commanders of the Air Force have almost all become the commanders of the fleet. The United States is still hesitating about personnel changes while conducting such a large operation. This is also one of the reasons for the defeat in this naval battle.

The United States Chess Player's Panic

Abe: The enemy's weaknesses cannot be overcome immediately, but we should pay attention to how they will fight in the future. After the sinking of the unsinkable battleship, they will no longer dream of building large battleships and relying on the so-called big ship and big guns doctrine to encompass the world. Times have changed. Now they are beginning to pay attention to the mobility of operations. Whoever has a strong air force can determine most of the war situation. That is what they think. It seems that there are quite a few people in Japan who think the same way. I am a layman, but I always feel that this is like playing chess. No matter how useful the "rook" is or how useful the "knight" is, the outcome always depends on the hand of the chess player. If the chess player is a master, even with only a few "pawns," it is not difficult to cross the Chu River and directly take the "general's" head. Japan used its air force to sink the British and American unsinkable battleships because Japan is a master. If it were the United States, it would not work. Now, the United States is not trying to hone its chess-playing skills but is instead dreaming of getting a few more "rooks" and "knights" to scare people. That is such a foolish idea! The United States is doing this because it has no choice, but we must not overestimate this point.

### On the Street Names of the Shanghai Special Zone

— Da Wen

For a newcomer to Shanghai from the countryside, trying to remember the street names of the Shanghai Special Zone often leads to jokes. The Special Zone is the Concession. The Concession is Chinese territory, leased to foreigners for residence; therefore, the administration and everything else in this area is tinged with foreign influence. The street names alone fully demonstrate this.

First, some street names in the Special Zone are named after foreigners, such as Hart Road, Seymour Road, Gordon Road, etc. Second, some street names in the Special Zone are named after foreigners, such as Avenue Joffre, Avenue Foch, and Avenue Edouard VII, etc. The most difficult to read and remember are names such as Route Mitter Hook and Route Paul Henry de Segur.

Recently, the Shanghai Anti-British and Anti-American Association has suggested to the Municipal Council that in order to eradicate British and American aggression, all street names with foreign names should be changed. The outcome is yet to be announced.

Forty or fifty years ago, when our country was "self-important," it naturally scorned foreign languages. At that time, some British and Americans, in order to cater to the psychology of the Chinese, often adopted Chinese surnames. Later, our country gradually "belittled" itself, and many people went the other way, considering it fashionable to adopt foreign names. Names like John and Mary could be heard and seen everywhere. On currency, postage stamps, train stations, city signs, and even on the copyright pages of non-translated books, Chinese and English were combined. School textbooks, except for Chinese, were desperately reading "original texts"; even Chinese history and geography used English textbooks. Under such a trend, even newcomers to Shanghai from the countryside were happy to twist their tongues and say: Route Mitter Hook, Route Paul Henry de Segur.

In terms of our country's ability to remember Shanghai street names, our ability to learn languages is actually very high. This is similar to how many illiterate old women and young mistresses are able to recognize the characters on mahjong tiles at a glance. Educators often express pessimism, saying that there are too many illiterates in our country; in fact, this pessimism is unnecessary. If the people of our country can use the same spirit to recognize and remember Shanghai Special Zone street names to promote literacy education or compulsory education, the effect will certainly be guaranteed.

### Miscellany

No one can stop the advance of history, just as no one can stop the advance of the waves.

The world, this great theater, like a chef, cooks various dishes, and it gives us tastes of all kinds of flavors.

A person should not place their life in a narrow realm, but should use sharp eyes to seek out the light that is hidden.

Waste materials, we can use various methods to utilize them, but, a useless person, is of no use at all.

### The Introduction of Western Civilization to Shanghai

— Feng Qi

After Shanghai opened trade with foreign countries, the introduction of Western civilization into our country also began from Shanghai.

Our country's railways started with the淞滬 (Songhu, Shanghai-Wusong) line as the earliest. It ran from Shanghai to Wusong, and was then called the Wusong Railway. It opened to traffic in mid-May of 1876 (Guangxu Year 2). Due to the ignorance and opposition of the general public, the government bought it back in early September and dismantled it in October of the following year.

The installation of telegraphs also started from Shanghai. On May 5, 1877, the Shanghai telegraph was first connected, with a message transmitted from Li Hongzhang's Yamen (official residence) to the Manufacturing Bureau, the message being the six characters "Yamen is one-quarter past noon."

The establishment of piped gas (自來火) in the concessions dates back to around 1874 (late Tongzhi period). It did not begin operation until 1875 (Guangxu Year 1). At that time, piped gas was called "earth fire lamp." At the beginning of its establishment, rumors abounded. Rumor-mongers said that if the earth fire became prevalent, the roads would be scorched, and the heat would inevitably attack the hearts and lungs of pedestrians. Piped gas is simply coal gas, which the Japanese call gas (瓦斯).

Several years after piped gas became popular in Shanghai, a Westerner named Litde established electric lights in the concessions. At that time, streetlights all used piped gas. After electric lights were established, because they were more convenient than piped gas, foreigners first installed them on the Bund.

In June 1882 (Guangxu Year 8), an Englishman named Bishop introduced the telephone to Shanghai, then commonly called "De Lv Feng" (德律風, a phonetic transliteration of 'telephone'). The South Bureau was set up at the 16th Pier, and the North Bureau was set up on Zhengfeng Street, but operations ceased due to insufficient funds. The following spring, a priest from the Xujiahui Church initiated a line from the church to the British, French, and American concessions to report wind, rain, and temperature. Later, various circles gradually realized its benefits and gradually installed them. A Westerner raised funds to establish a company and formally started operations.

### Experience

— Hu Ruoliu

Experience is the capital of a career. How much experience you have, determines how much career you can make.

In all careers, experience and career are directly proportional to each other.

The value of experience comes entirely from hard work. If you are afraid of suffering, then you don't even want to gain experience. Understanding how to endure hardship leads to rich experience, and with rich experience, one will inevitably be able to create a great career! (Moved by Charity to Aid Education)

### Sharing the Same Boat Through Storms

— He Jia Zhi

One, Vengeance

When Old Mrs. Chen heard Wei Cheng utter only the three words "Ant Mound Town," her two eyeballs stared straight at Wei Cheng's face, and she said, "What? Ant Mound Town, are you from Ant Mound Town?" Wei Cheng and Huang Long, neither of them dared to neglect Old Mrs. Chen's expression and words. Seeing that she was somewhat surprised, they thought that Old Mrs. Chen must have some connection with Ant Mound Town. At that time, Wei Cheng replied, "Great Aunt, yes, we are from Ant Mound Town. We are looking for a family named Chen, the Chen with the character '禾' (grain) beside it, the family of Cheng Chunhui." Old Mrs. Chen almost forgot that she was ill, and hurriedly sat up from the rattan chair. But she couldn't sit up, and as she sat up, she fell backward again. The old servant was quick, and hurriedly grabbed a kapok pillow to pad behind Old Mrs. Chen's back. Old Mrs. Chen gasped and said, "Who?" Wei Cheng said, "Cheng Chunhui, could it be that Great Aunt also knows this family." Old Mrs. Chen said, "I don't know them, but, we used to live in Ant Mound Town. Hearing this name, it sounds strangely familiar." Huang Long stood behind Wei Cheng, nudging Wei Cheng's back with his arm, meaning: you have to pay attention. Wei Cheng said, "I heard that Cheng Chunhui's family has a medicine for treating heart pain, and they don't take money from people. We went to ask for the medicine." Huang Long said, "Yes, my family has an old mother who has suffered from heart pain for more than ten years, and no one can cure her. Hearing that the Cheng family had medicine, we went to Ant Mound Town, regardless of it being the first day of the new year. But we didn't find it. When we asked there, the Cheng family was a barren land, with grass growing as tall as people. We ran in vain! No one can cure my old mother's illness!"

Huang Long's throat produced a sigh, and suddenly two lines of clear tears fell from Old Mrs. Chen's eye sockets. She wiped her eyelids with her palm, and her face drooped. The old servant said, "Old lady, we were talking normally, why are you sad again?" Old Mrs. Chen sobbed, "I'm not because of this, Guo Fang's father is gone, our family is finished. They hid it from me before, afraid that I'm old, and hearing it would make me faint,..." (242)

### Memoirs of the Defeat in Malaya (4)

— Notes by General Percival, Former Commander of the British Army in Malaya

Notes by General Percival, Former Commander of the British Army in Malaya

The Battle of Jitra to the North

Originally, the Jitra area was not an easy area to defend. It was particularly difficult against an enemy with naval superiority. (Note)

(Translator's Note) This precisely illustrates the powerful pressure exerted by our naval mobile unit on northern Jitra.

The reason for this lies in the fact that there are two main roads, the Kuala Lumpur road and the coastal road, in addition to a railway line that facilitates movement. Furthermore, there are many rubber tree plantations in the area, making it very easy for troops to move around. On the other hand, because the main airfield was located on the Maner-Sikul-Batto Pahat road, the battle had to unfold to the north of that road. For the battle of the northern Jitra area, it was decided to establish a new Western Army under the command of Major General Gordon Bennett. The organization of this army was roughly as follows:

The Australian Army (lacking a brigade in Maner), the Indian 9th Division.

The Indian 45th Infantry Brigade (transferred to Johore from India). Initially, Major General Gordon Bennett's plan was roughly as follows: To deploy the Australian Army and the Indian 9th Division in the northern positions of Sungai Petani, and to place a small number of ambushes in the northern positions of that area. The Indian 45th Infantry Brigade, with the support of several Australian artillery units, was tasked with monitoring the crossing points of the Muar River on the coastal road. The remaining area of Jitra was under the command of the Third Indian Corps. Its headquarters were located in Jitra Bahru. And the units under its command were listed as follows:

The Indian 1st Division, which was engaged in rear service and was being reorganized in the areas of Kulim, Bukit Mertajam, Kechil, and Batto Pahat. One brigade of the Australian Army in the Maner area.

The pursuing Japanese army soon made contact with our army in the area of Sungai Petani. Our ambush troops gave them a head-on blow, reaping considerable results. Several Japanese tanks and many large units of the advancing Japanese army were immediately rendered "unable to fight". (Note)

(Translator's Note) Our Gotanda Tank Unit was tragically sacrificed at this time.

However, at this time, the Japanese troops advancing along the coastal road suddenly completed the crossing of the Muar River and took advantage of the victory to attack our army defending the Muar River area. In order to support the Indian 45th Infantry Brigade, we dispatched two battalions of the Australian Army (one withdrawn from Sungai Petani, one withdrawn from the Maner area), and later dispatched a large battalion of the recently arrived 53rd Infantry Brigade (i.e., the 18th Division) to ensure the safety west of Yong Peng. We also moved the Indian 6th and 15th Mixed Brigades from Kulim to Batto Pahat. Due to the closure of the rear road, our garrison vehicles in the Muar area suddenly lost contact, directly threatening the main force fighting in the Sungai Petani area. Under these circumstances, the order was given to immediately retreat to the Kulim Ayer Hitam position. This operation was very skillfully executed, so the entire unit was able to retreat safely, suffering only minimal losses. The new configuration was roughly as follows:

### Cantonese Cuisine Authority "Nanguo Restaurant" Impression Record, Majestic on the Sea… Unparalleled…

— Nanguo Beauty

The Shanghai people's culinary fortune has been improving in recent years. No matter which regional cuisine restaurant it is, there is not a day that it is not "always full of guests." People say that there is too much floating capital on the sea, which is also a piece of supporting evidence. Speaking of eating in Shanghai, it is truly an extremely mysterious and contradictory phenomenon. One day I passed the intersection of Yunnan Road and Nanjing Road and caught a glimpse of a large Western-style building, with hundreds of craftsmen working busily, and countless passers-by looking up and gazing. It is said that this is the "Nanguo Restaurant" that is about to open. I couldn't help but become curious and asked that the organizers of this restaurant are all Cantonese cuisine magnates organized together. Mr. Huang Ruilin and Jian Yimin were gesticulating and busy directing the craftsmen to work. Seeing us arrive, they immediately led us into the reception room. They talked in detail about everything about the "Nanguo Restaurant" for half an hour, which is described below:

(1) Magnificent Architecture

"Nanguo Restaurant" is a limited liability company organization, with a capital of 2.5 million yuan. The founders are all Cantonese cuisine experts with over two or thirty years of experience. It took a long five months to complete the preparation of the "Nanguo Restaurant." In terms of construction alone, it has taken more than three months from the architectural design and sampling by architect Li Jinpei to the present. The entire renovation was undertaken by Mr. Liang Tiju, the owner of the Heji Construction Factory, who used his many years of experience, carefully planned and organized, mobilized more than 300 people, and worked day and night to rush the project, putting in painstaking effort, to produce this satisfactory new type of restaurant. This building is very magnificent, more than ten zhang (approximately 33 meters) long, entirely built of green tiles, with a refined and elegant appearance. The four-story roof has a chimney standing upright, towering into the clouds. Saying it resembles a world-class cruise ship is truly a wonderful metaphor. The front door is sprayed with gold paint. Entering the door is the reception hall, with the bar and ordering area standing to the left and right. Opposite is the telephone room, designed in the style of a wireless radio, which is very unique. The electric clock hanging on the wall cost ten thousand yuan for just the two red gold hands. Inside to the right is the tea room, with Western-style oil paintings painted on all four walls, and all the lights are concealed. At night, you can't see the electric lights, and the light is sufficient, soft, and pleasing to the eye, to say nothing of the other things. The water heaters are also concealed. In this severe cold, it is as warm as spring. Ladies and gentlemen are seated among them. The degree of comfort is guaranteed to be much more satisfactory than that of ordinary cinemas and dance halls!

(2) Luxurious Equipment

The woodenware used in "Nanguo Restaurant" is made by Jinan Company, and the table silverware is custom-made by Guangya Factory, which is beautiful and exquisite, and will definitely satisfy customers. The building has four floors in total. The second and third floors each have ten large dining rooms, with cream-colored walls and teak floors, which are naturally luxurious. Behind the dining rooms, there are specially set up train seat dining rooms, where there is a different kind of scene. If a careless person simply doesn't see these exquisite seats, it is like the ancient saying "after the darkness of willows and the brightness of flowers, another village appears." These seats are completely the same on the second and third floors, with a total capacity of 200 people dining together. To tell a joke, if you make an appointment with a lover to taste tea and talk, without leaking any secrets, that would be an excellent place. The lighting of "Nanguo Restaurant," as mentioned above, is concealed in the downstairs tea room, while the second floor is light lake green, and the third floor is light yellow; these are special installations by the Fuli and Huamei Electric Appliance Stores, making people feel unusually refreshed. Speaking of the scientific kitchen on the fourth floor, the scale is grand enough. The large refrigerator on the south side has a capacity as large as a moving truck. Fish, meat, and other ingredients are stored as much as possible, and the freshness and deliciousness are self-evident. The northwest sides are full of white porcelain stoves with twenty or thirty burners. The speed and convenience of cooking will naturally be sufficient. The ancients said, "A gentleman stays away from the kitchen." Nowadays, restaurants do not welcome customers to visit the kitchen, as if there is an unspeakable mystery inside. Only "Nanguo Restaurant" breaks this mystery and absolutely welcomes visits. This is because of the scientific equipment, cleanliness, and hygiene, which are something to be proud of.

(3) Abundant Talent Lineup

In all undertakings, there is comparison after competition, and progress after comparison. What's more, Shanghai is a large international metropolis. Which undertaking is not in overt and covert competition? Especially the restaurant industry, with Beijing cuisine, Sichuan cuisine, and Cantonese cuisine already above all other regional cuisines. Among Cantonese cuisines, the competition in recent years has been very fierce. Large capital and a wide venue are not enough. It is necessary to concentrate talent, have rich experience, and be able to innovate, change endlessly, and win the hearts of customers. "Nanguo Restaurant" is not only financially strong and has a spacious venue, but also has abundant talent, gathering the authorities of Cantonese cuisine together. I will now introduce a few to readers to recognize: Chairman Li Yushu is a giant in the Shanghai business world; Manager Huang Ruilin, Deputy Manager Jian Yimin, Liu Yongxi, and Wu Fuhua are all old hands from the New Asia Hotel and Quanhua Restaurant; Standing Director He Yuechi is the founder of Cantonese cuisine, accumulating forty years of experience, and the old owner of the former Wei Ya Restaurant; He Xuechen, who is in charge of foreign affairs, is the former young owner of Wei Ya, and also has a history of twenty years of struggle; Kitchen foremen Ma Bao and Feng Pei lead dozens of chefs, all of whom are also Cantonese cuisine experts. In the industry, mentioning the two foremen Ma and Feng, who doesn't know them? With such a neat, invincible lineup, serving the customers of "Nanguo Restaurant" from all sides is naturally more than enough, and victory can be assured.

(4) Horticultural Expert's Arrangement

In order to make the customer's environment particularly beautiful, the Nanguo authorities specially invited Mr. Zhou Shoujuan and his son, the mainstays of Xiangxue Garden, to create exquisite bonsai, which are placed in each dining room so that customers can linger and appreciate them after being drunk and full. These bonsai are all made of evergreen small trees, matched with figures and pavilions. Each pot has its own title, such as "Nanguo Restaurant," "Ancient Tree Hermit," "Pine Breeze Hermit," "Searching for Poetry Under Cypress Trees," "Bo Ya Playing the Qin," "Seeking Sentences in the Bamboo Forest," "Small Steps on the Creek Bridge," "Returning Home," and "Idle and Having Nothing to Do Playing Chess." Each pot contains poetic sentiment, and each pot is rich in artistic conception. All fresh flowers are supplied by the Butterfly Flower Shop, mainly led by the cultural figure Huang Jiping, in a variety of colors, pleasing to the eye and heart, making people feel as if they have entered a country of fragrant flowers.

(5) Attentive Service of the Waiters

At the beginning of its opening, "Nanguo Restaurant" clearly stated three major goals: (1) Standardization of cooking; (2) Rationalization of pricing; (3) Agility of service. Therefore, special attention is paid to the courtesy of male and female waiters in dealing with people. Most of them were hired from other restaurants, and a few were strictly trained. They are not only familiar with various local dialects, but also able to respond in Japanese. Wearing designated clothing, with a beautiful appearance; and a kind and pleasant demeanor; speaking and doing things entirely according to the customer's psychology. Regarding personnel and business aspects, Mr. Lei Yujing and Lu Jizhong are guiding them. They have many insights into this path. In short, everything in "Nanguo Restaurant" seeks rational beautification, such as the architecture, decoration, layout, furniture, tableware, and the quality of the dishes, cooking techniques, etc., based on our consistent principles and sincere attitude, to serve all sectors of society and serve customers. If there is any inadequacy, we sincerely ask our colleagues, advanced experts, and elegant scholars to teach us at any time, which would be deeply fortunate!
