Reuter, Ankara, 16th – According to Turkish sources, a large number of Axis reinforcements are being transported to North Africa via Greece and Crete, with 50,000 stationed on Crete, half German and half Italian, and will be transported to Africa by sea and air. This indicates that General Rommel has not abandoned his plans to advance from Egypt to the Middle East. The question is whether the Axis forces will attack Egypt after the reinforcements arrive, or wait until the climate is more favorable in September.

Reuter, Lisbon, 15th – German and Italian forces, having resumed their general offensive against Egypt, launched a fierce attack on the British right flank in the coastal area after attacking the left flank of the Al Alamein area. On the 15th, the British command announced that on the night of the 14th, Rommel's forces attacked from near the hills west of Al Alamein. The battle continued throughout the night. General Auchinleck's troops were facing the enemy head-on, and the situation was quite tense. According to a report by Russell, a special correspondent for the Associated Press, Rommel's forces are launching surprise attacks. Both sides are awaiting the arrival of reinforcements and replenishment of weapons. The current battle is a stalemate, and its intensity is evident.

Havas, Rome, 15th – Local newspapers today commented on the Egyptian battle situation, stating that the Axis High Command is currently in Egypt, busy reorganizing its forces. Britain has already transferred a large number of fresh troops to reinforce its forces, which is absolutely necessary. Currently, the British army's repeated counterattacks, attempting to repel the German and Italian coalition forces, have all failed, only exhausting its soldiers. However, according to the Evening Post, the pressure exerted by the Axis forces on the enemy in Egypt is increasing, not decreasing. The British army's repeated counterattacks are all futile. However, the Axis forces need to consolidate their positions after advancing from Derna straight to Al Alamein, so the current temporary halt to their advance should not be considered a true standstill.

Havas, Somewhere on the Libyan Border, 15th – Axis forces have launched three fierce attacks on El Alamein, six miles west of El Eisa, in the past three days. The last attack began last night and is still ongoing. Details of the overall situation have not yet been obtained.

According to British private sources, several companies of Axis infantry, under the cover of 18 tanks, launched a fierce attack on El Eisa. Aircraft from both sides participated in the battle. Later, artillery units also opened fire and exchanged fire. However, the Axis forces' repeated attacks were repulsed by Australian troops. According to Allied sources, the British Air Force defended British positions very successfully. Newly manufactured "Hurricane" and "Kittyhawk" bombers have recently been deployed.

### Alexandria-Based French Warships Rumored to be Sailing to an Unspecified Port; Laval Claims He Will Issue a Statement Reporting on Talks with Germany, Italy, and the U.S.

Reuter, Turkish Capital, 16th – Nine French warships are currently anchored in the Egyptian port of Alexandria, all of which have been disarmed. Therefore, the question of their movement is quite complicated. According to sources in London, French officers in Alexandria have agreed to sail the ships to an unspecified port in the event of danger. However, the British naval authorities have neither confirmed nor denied this claim, so its reliability is unknown. The numbers and tonnage of the nine warships are as follows: one battleship, the "Lorraine," 22,189 tons, completed in 1934, with a crew of 1,133 sailors and eight 13-inch guns; three heavy cruisers, equipped with 8-inch guns, including the "Tourville" and "Duquesne," each 10,000 tons, and the "Suffren," 9,938 tons; one light cruiser, the "Duguay-Trouin," 7,880 tons; three destroyers, each 1,378 tons; one submarine, 2,060 tons.

The U.S. had suggested that the French warships be transferred to Martinique Island, but Laval also refused, as the French warships in Alexandria are also bound by the German-French armistice agreement. The French note also stated that if Britain, with the consent of the U.S. government, destroys the French warships in Alexandria, the U.S. should be held responsible.

Havas, Paris, 15th – The head of the French government, Laval, told the press today that regarding the disposition of the French fleet in Alexandria, he will issue a statement on the 16th, reporting on the talks between the government and the governments of Germany, Italy, and the U.S. This fleet has been anchored in Alexandria since the signing of the Franco-German armistice agreement in June 1940, under the command of Vice Admiral Godefroy.

### Number of Japanese Ships Increases

Reuter, Tokyo, 16th – The Japanese government, recognizing that enhancing the transportation capacity of ships is essential to completing the Greater East Asia War, has submitted a planned shipbuilding proposal to the 80th Diet. As a result, the Japanese shipbuilding industry is taking a giant step forward in its history. The ships used to transport goods in the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, at minimum, should be 15 million tons. Colonel Hirade of the Navy Press Department also believes that 30 million tons are needed. Therefore, it is expected that the Japanese maritime transport industry will make rapid progress in the future. Japan is a maritime nation and the foundation of its strength lies in its maritime transport industry. At the time of the Meiji Restoration, Japan only had 90 ships. Before the Sino-Japanese War, the total tonnage of its ships was 160,000 tons. 50,000 tons were added during the war. Ten years later, when the Russo-Japanese War broke out, there were already 630,000 tons. Another 400,000 tons were added during the war. Therefore, when the Russo-Japanese War ended, the total number of its ships had reached over one million tons. The First World War was the golden age for the Japanese maritime transport industry. By the end of the war, the tonnage of ships had jumped from 1.7 million tons to 3 million tons. With the implementation of planned shipbuilding in the future, it is expected that there will be more increases in Japanese ships.

The Conference faction and other parties should automatically dissolve.

### Former Argentine President Ortiz Passes Away

Boguchar is located southwest of Voronezh and Rossosh, approximately 120 miles from the former and 60 miles from the latter. Millerovo is directly south of Boguchar, 72 miles away. The threat to Soviet forces in the Rostov-Voroshilovgrad area has increased due to the fall of these cities. German forces have reached a point east of Voroshilovgrad, only 45 miles from the city.

Bern, 16th, Allied News Agency Dispatch: The German-Soviet war has unfolded across 600 miles from Kharkov to Zhastov, creating a critical situation with the potential to sever the Soviet Union's lifeline. Simultaneously, German forces continue their southward advance, nearing Stalingrad, a major Soviet industrial city on the Volga River bend.

Bern, 15th, Allied News Agency Dispatch: German forces are launching a full-scale offensive in central and southern Russia across a 600-mile front. The battle of Voronezh, on the east bank of the Don River, is particularly fierce and reached a decisive stage yesterday.

The attacking German force consists of over a thousand tanks and several divisions of elite infantry, rigorously trained last winter. Casualties on both sides are heavy.

Germans Continue Offensive on Southern Front Despite Intense Heat

Berlin, 16th, Huitong News Agency Dispatch: The German High Command announced last night that German forces on the southern front in the east continue to pursue routed Soviet troops and attack enemy units with cut-off rear lines. Besieged Soviet forces repeatedly attempted to break out but failed. German forces continued their pursuit, destroying 12 enemy tanks and capturing numerous enemy prisoners and artillery pieces.

Somewhere on the Ukrainian Border, 15th, Havas News Agency Dispatch: Despite the intense heat and the exhaustion of men and horses, German forces continued their full-scale offensive on the southern front yesterday. General von Kleist intends to seize the opportunity to prevent General Timoshenko from reorganizing his forces. It is reported that German forces in the Donets region, advancing along the Stalino-Kamenetsk railway, have reached the city of Zverevo, 90 miles northeast of Rostov. German forces in the Don region have also reached the city of Tsymlyansk, eight miles west of the Don River. However, Soviet forces on the front lines before Voroshilovgrad are putting up strong resistance. Despite repeated German assaults, they have failed to break through the Soviet lines. The situation on the Sea of Azov front is also stalemated. German vanguards reached the city of Salsk six days ago, and the situation remains deadlocked. Rumors that German forces and their allies are only seven miles from Rostov have not been confirmed by German officials. It is said that the current German military operations in that area are not truly intended to attack the city's strong defenses but are intended to tie down large Soviet forces and prevent them from maneuvering. Furthermore, few Soviet soldiers have been captured in this campaign, indicating that the Soviet command had anticipated the German offensive and was able to conduct an organized retreat. The usual encirclement tactics have not had much effect, with only one significant pocket, the Krinichnaya pocket six days ago. However, Soviet forces have broken through the German lines, and most of the encircled units have escaped. As things stand, Soviet forces continue to retreat on all fronts, and it is not known when or where they will stop. The German forces fighting south of Voronezh and in the Don region were stationed in Stalino and the Donets region this spring and were only transferred to Kupiansk at the beginning of this month. Their former defensive positions have been filled by German and Romanian forces from Sevastopol.

Lisbon, 16th, Allied News Agency Dispatch: Following the launch of the German summer offensive, the Soviet Union has suffered a major crisis, causing deep concern in Britain and the United States.

According to an Associated Press dispatch from London, the Soviet government has instructed its ambassador to Britain, Maisky, to demand that the British government immediately commence landing operations on the European continent and to exaggerate the damage inflicted on the German southern front in propaganda.

Stockholm, 16th, Huitong News Agency Dispatch: A London correspondent for "Stockholms-Tidningen" reported that the British newspapers' tacit attitude towards the second front has sparked rumors in London. The silence of the British press is almost entirely opposite to the noise of the British people, because of the strict press censorship, hence Swedish newspapers believe the establishment of the second front is in preparation. London is now filled with troops, especially American soldiers. The sudden arrival of Roosevelt's personal envoy William Bullitt, though semi-officially said to represent the U.S. Navy Secretary Knox to discuss the escort of the Arctic, but it is believed Bullitt's visit is related to the establishment of a second front.

Sydney, 15th, Havas News Agency Dispatch: The Sydney Morning Herald recently stated: "If Britain and the United States remain passive until the Soviet Union is defeated, their chances of ultimately defeating Hitler will be extremely slim.

For the sake of Allied interests, it is necessary to immediately open a second front in Europe without delay."

Madrid, 16th, Haidisha News Agency Dispatch: The "Ya" newspaper's New York correspondent, Lu Qichuan, wired yesterday that war news from Moscow to the United States has worsened. Not only American communists or pro-Soviet elements, but ordinary Americans have already felt the whole Soviet front line is shaken. The New York Times said that every event has made the Allied countries feel surprised. Democratic countries are no less than in fantasy. We have miscalculated the local victory of the Soviet Union in winter and the bombing of German cities by the British army. We are convinced that the loss of Ukraine is not beneficial to Hitler, because the harvest there has been "destroyed. This statement is partly true, because the Soviet Union has lost its main grain producing area, and its loss is extremely serious. Therefore, if the German army can occupy the Soviet oil area, even if the oil pool is destroyed, the Soviet Union will lose its most valuable oil area. Now General Timoshenko and General Auchinleck's troops are in a precarious situation. If we should open a second front, we should launch it immediately to avoid being too late.

### Soviet Murmansk (3): A Seaport within the Arctic Circle - Murmansk Obtains Industry

Before the war, Murmansk was a key port for import and export. Furs shipped to the United States were almost all exported from here. Imports included American cotton, British and German machinery, and Spitzbergen coal. These goods, along with fish, apatite, and lumber produced along the Murmansk coast, were transported by rail from Murmansk to various parts of the Soviet Union. From the inland, salt and daily necessities were transported to Murmansk to supply the fishermen and miners along the Murmansk coast. Although the transportation of goods and passengers was subject to strict control and restrictions, the volume of transport was extremely large. From this, we can see that Murmansk was not only the military and administrative center of northwestern Soviet Union before the war, but also formed an increasingly important economic base in the expanding Arctic region.

This gloomy place is known for its abundant natural resources. Since 1920, the Soviet government has successively dispatched hundreds of geologists and engineers to Murmansk. Numerous mines have now been developed, and many factories have been established.

The Khibiny apatite mining area possesses the world's largest reserves, and there are iron ore deposits in the Murmansk region with reserves of approximately 1.5 billion tons. Mica, granite, excellent limestone, and various clays are also produced in abundance in this region. In addition, it produces roofing tiles and is a source of vanadium, molybdenum, and other metals.

One of Murmansk's important industries is fishing. Fishermen can catch huge quantities of whales, cod, halibut, bass, and other fish in the Barents Sea and the White Sea. They use modern large-scale methods to catch sharks. Nets are constantly stretched to catch salmon, trout, and bass in the rivers and lakes of Murmansk. At the same time, trawlers and motorboats have replaced old-

### Quarrel Over Rent Value: Landlord Gathers Crowd to Assault Tenant, Tailor Chen Caisheng Severely Injured, Life in Danger, Second Landlord Shen Baohua Flees After the Attack

Since the currency reform, rent issues have lacked definitive solutions, leading to frequent disputes. Second landlords insist on converting old currency into Central Reserve Certificates at full value, resulting in incidents where second landlords gather thugs to severely injure tenants. As the concession authorities strictly enforce regulations against subletting, such incidents require thorough investigation to deter troublemakers and ensure public well-being. The detailed account of the incident is as follows:

Of a Naturally Ferocious, Strong, Overbearing and Despotic Nature

Shen Baohua, the second landlord of No. 7 Yanqing Lane, Xiamen Road, Public Concession, is over thirty years old, from Cixi. He used to be a vagrant but recently worked as a salesman at a rubber factory. He is known for his ferocity, possessing latent power, and frequently resorting to force for intimidation. People in the alley fear him like a tiger.

An Additional 20% on Top of the 75% Rent

Chen Caisheng, a tailor residing in the living room of the house, is forty-five years old, from Changzhou. He runs the Chen Yongxing Garment Shop and has a good business. The monthly rent is $28.70. Due to the currency reform, Shen insisted on collecting rent in the new legal tender. After agreeing to a 25% discount, Shen claimed increased water, electricity, and donation costs and added another 20% to the rent. All the tenants objected and refused to pay the rent, resulting in a stalemate lasting over ten days.

Gathering Thugs to Assault the Tailor

On the 12th of the month at 3 PM, Chen had just returned from outside. Shen demanded rent from him, leading to a quarrel. Soon after, Shen led over ten male and female thugs, who rushed in and attacked Chen with fists and feet. Chen was injured and fell to the ground. His wife, Madam Guan (43 years old), and eldest son, Youcheng (20 years old, studying at the Shanghai College of Traditional Chinese Medicine), were also beaten. Seeing their goal achieved, the thugs dispersed. Afterwards, Chen hired a rickshaw to the Old Zhabei Police Station to report the incident. However, before he could finish speaking, he fainted and collapsed, losing consciousness.

Severe Injury to the Left Waist, Life in Danger

The police immediately sent him to Renji Hospital. After examination by the doctor, it was revealed that besides injuries to the face and chest, the fatal injury was to his left waist, where blood vessels had been severed. Surgery was necessary, involving opening the abdomen. Whether his life could be saved was uncertain. When the reporter went to investigate, he met Chen Youcheng, who said, "My father's constitution is weak. Having suffered such a severe injury, his condition has worsened daily for the past two days. He is unable to speak, and his life is likely hopeless."

The Perpetrator Fled, Strict Investigation Should Be Conducted

It is understood that Shen's house is a two-story building. Apart from a small room in the back of the lower floor occupied by himself, the rest is rented out to others, totaling thirteen households. The primary landlord only receives 108 yuan in rent, while the total rent Shen collects from the tenants amounts to a substantial 544.80 yuan. After the incident, Shen and his family abandoned the house and fled, and have not yet been apprehended. It is also learned that one of his accomplices, Yu Ruifeng, was captured on the afternoon of the previous day and sent for investigation.

### Donations for Education Flourishing

### Second Batch of Rice Purchase Certificates Scheduled to Begin Distribution, Four Coupons Per Certificate Distributed Starting on the 20th of This Month Upon Presentation of Summer Property Tax Receipt

The Public Works Department recently issued Announcement No. 6001, stating that the second batch of rice purchase certificates will begin distribution on Monday, the 20th of this month. These rice purchase certificates will still be in four coupons, valid for the fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth weeks. Taxpayers or their representatives can bring their summer property tax receipts to the rice purchase certificate distribution office in their respective districts on the date indicated on the back of the receipt to claim the rice purchase certificate. Taxpayers or residents who cannot produce the summer property tax receipt or have questions about the date of claiming the rice purchase certificate should visit the rice purchase certificate distribution office between 3 PM and 4 PM daily for inquiries. The office hours of each distribution office are from 9 AM to noon and from 1 PM to 4 PM daily. Closed on Sundays.

Increased Amount of Broken Rice in the Third Phase of Food Rations

The Public Works Department issued sales orders to 415 rice shops in the Public Concession the day before yesterday, and continued to issue sales orders to 44 rice shops in the French Concession yesterday. Starting yesterday, they began extracting broken rice, white rice, and flour from Taikoo, Zhejiang Xingye, and other warehouses. The amount of flour paired with the rice remains the same, but the number of broken rice bags exceeds the number of white rice bags. The reason is that starting on the 20th, rice shops will issue residents with one liter of broken rice, half a liter of white rice, and one and a half jin of flour per household based on the third phase of rice purchase certificates. The selling price of white rice and broken rice remains 3.80 yuan, and flour is 3.70 yuan. Although the selling price remains unchanged, the quantity of broken rice and white rice is the opposite of the second phase of household rice.

### Silver Trade Warehouses Thoroughly Inspect Hoarded Goods, Deadline Set for Redemption of Daily Necessities, Crackdown on Individual Hoarding to Curb Speculation

Silver shops and banks with their own warehouses, such as Zhejiang Xingye, Zhongshi, Siming, Shanghai, Tongshang, Kenye, Datong, Donglai, Jincheng, Guohua, Gongye, Zikang, Jinyuan, Zhongyi, and Jianghai, have all complied with the notice from the Silver Trade Federation to thoroughly inspect the goods hoarded in their warehouses, including the types of goods, quantities, dates of entry and exit, and the names of the owners. It is reported that the authorities will strictly review these hoarded goods. If they are daily necessities, a deadline will be set for redemption. Individual hoarding will be cracked down on to curb speculation and stabilize prices.

### Criminal Report for June in the French Concession Shows Decrease in Crimes

In June, there were three murder cases in the French Concession. On June 15, an elderly Chinese woman in Qianjiatang poisoned her 38-day-old grandchild because her daughter refused to send her back to her hometown. On June 25, a female domestic worker on Ganshidong Road, due to unemployment and poverty, attempted suicide with gas and poison, also poisoning her three children. She and one child were rescued. On June 27, a five-year-old Chinese child on Avenue Joffre was struck with a stool by the enemy of his brother and died on the way to the hospital. The murderer fled and was arrested. The above three cases are currently being tried by the court. There were only three armed robbery cases this month, compared to ten in May. In addition, ten robbers from the robbery case in May were apprehended this month. There were a total of 98 thefts (144 in April and 137 in May), including 40 cases of burglary and destruction, 40 cases of trespassing theft, and 17 cases of robbery.

During large-scale searches on roads and in alleys, a total of 39 suspects were apprehended, 29 of whom were repeat offenders. In this work and during terror drills, the police continued to receive assistance from the French Army, especially the efforts of the Baojia personnel.

### Small Parcel Mail Subject to Overdue Fees

A notice from the Shanghai Postal Administration states, "The Postal General Administration has ordered that 'For small parcels that need to be collected by the recipient at the post office, recipients often delay collection after receiving the collection notice, which increases the post office's storage responsibilities and storage costs.

Therefore, it is hereby announced for public information. The details are as follows: 1. Recipients who collect the parcel within five days of receiving the notice will be exempt from overdue fees. 2.

### Wooden Furniture Store Encountered a Swindle

On the morning of the 13th, three uninvited guests suddenly arrived at the Yu Wu Woodware Store at No. 143 Haig Road in West Shanghai. All of them were well-dressed and pretended to be buying wooden furniture such as sofas. The clerks greeted them warmly. While one of them was talking to the clerk, the other two took the opportunity to break into the accounting room and stole a wallet from the Western-style suit bag that the owner of the store had placed on the sofa. The wallet contained 640 yuan in Central Reserve Certificates, 9 yuan in military currency, and dozens of other miscellaneous notes, as well as a transportation certificate and two receipts. They carried the stolen goods and left. When the owner discovered the theft and gave chase, they had disappeared. He had no choice but to accept his misfortune.

### Common Knowledge of Epidemic Prevention

Recently, the climate in the city has been extremely hot, and many cases of true cholera have been discovered, spreading rapidly, causing great fear. The reporter especially visited the person in charge of the Shanghai Epidemic Hospital and learned that the current cholera epidemic in the city is rampant. A total of 67 people in the city have been diagnosed with true cholera, 62 of whom have been treated at the hospital. Some have recovered and been discharged. Six people died because the illness was too severe to treat. Most cases are in the Nanshi area. There is one case each on Jessfield Road in the Public Concession and Wuzhou Road in Hongkou. There is one case each on Avenue Eduard VII, Route Tenant de Tourville, and Route Lupan in the French Concession. Those who have not yet been vaccinated must be vaccinated as soon as possible. Those who have already been vaccinated once must still get a second dose to ensure better protection.

Germs

The cause of cholera is due to the harmful effects of cholera bacteria. Cholera bacteria are shaped like the letter "C" or a crescent moon. Although small, their reproduction rate is astounding. According to a certain doctor's research, one cholera bacterium can reproduce to 120 times the world's population in one hour. Moreover, their resistance is extremely strong. They will not freeze to death even if placed in the same place as ice. They can still survive without water for several days. However, they die within minutes when exposed to acidic liquids, sunlight, or high heat.

Transmission

Cholera is mostly transmitted through unclean drinking water, food, or contact with cholera patients. Flies are the primary medium for spreading cholera bacteria. Cut-open melons and fruits, and raw and cold foods should not be eaten indiscriminately to prevent germs from entering the body and causing cholera. Patients not only suffer severe damage to their health, but also risk death if they delay treatment. Caution is essential.

Symptoms

The symptoms of cholera are vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, chills, fever, chest tightness, and muscle cramps in the hands and feet. In Chinese custom, there are names such as "Shuoluo Sha," "Jiaochang Sha," "Outu Sha," as well as "chou jin," and "diao jiao." This is because most people do not know the cause of the disease and diagnose the illness based only on the obvious symptoms. In reality, it is cholera.

Treatment

If a cholera patient is found in any household, they must be sent to the hospital for treatment immediately. This will ensure the safety of the patient and prevent transmission to others. Moreover, hospitals are well-equipped and treatment is more effective. Avoid trusting unqualified doctors and taking random medications, which may delay the best opportunity for recovery. Currently, there are six main hospitals in the city that accept cholera patients: Shanghai Epidemic Hospital on Rue Chappe, Zhenxin Epidemic Hospital on Tianjin Road, the Second Emergency Epidemic Hospital on Avenue du Lieutenant Petiot, Isolation Hospital on Sixth Road, Guangci Hospital on Avenue du Père Robert, and Zhabei Isolation Hospital. At the Shanghai Epidemic Hospital, hospitalization in the third-class ward is completely free, and registration fees and leaf fees are not charged. The poor and sick benefit greatly.

Ambulance

In previous years, when cholera was prevalent in the summer, various emergency epidemic hospitals had ambulances available to transport patients to the hospital for treatment. Now, due to the shortage of gasoline, the ambulances of various hospitals have been discontinued and replaced by ambulances dispatched by the fire brigades of the two concessions to transport patients to the hospital. However, the hospital authorities must contact the fire brigade before this can take effect. If patients are found at night and need to be sent to the hospital for treatment, they are exempt from inspection of the curfew pass. Medical treatment for emergencies is always permitted.

### True Cholera Discovered at the Second Emergency Epidemic Hospital

The hospital offers free consultation and hospitalization.

Patients do not require referrals and are treated day and night.

The Shanghai Second Emergency Epidemic Hospital at 47A Avenue du Lieutenant Petiot has been extremely busy due to the hot weather, with a constant stream of poor and sick people seeking treatment. This is because the hospital is conscientious in its work, provides attentive service, and is completely charitable in nature. Whether it is consultation or hospitalization, medicine, food, and accommodation are all free. In particular, patients do not require introductions from acquaintances, and the wards are not divided into grades, which provides patients with many conveniences and has earned unanimous praise from all sectors.

The number of outpatients and inpatients in the hospital has increased sharply in recent days, with most cases being dysentery and gastroenteritis. However, yesterday, a female patient, Madam Ye Huang, 21 years old, residing at No. 213 Connaught Road, was confirmed to have true cholera after examination. She is currently in ward number 4 of the hospital, and Chinese medicine doctors are carefully treating her. She is progressing well. Other patients are still under examination.

The hospital has been in operation for three sessions and is hosted by the Shanghai New Pharmaceutical Industry Service Guild, with Xu Xiaochu serving as chairman. In addition to the two guilds being responsible for donations, various sectors have been donating spontaneously in large numbers. However, with the soaring prices of various goods, each patient requires at least 10 yuan per day, which is not something that one person or one industry can afford. It is hoped that all sectors will donate spontaneously to benefit the poor and sick.

### Scenes of Enjoying the Cool Air

If the joy of winter lies in gathering around the hearth, then the joy of summer lies in enjoying the cool air. However, to enjoy the hearth, a family must have some money. As with last winter, when white coal sold for more than 300 yuan per dan, it was difficult for the lower and middle classes to enjoy the warmth of the hearth. Enjoying the cool air is different. It is available to both rich and poor. As long as you bring a stool and sit at the alley entrance or by the roadside in the evening when the sun has set and the heat has subsided, the gentle breeze will blow fairly on everyone, gradually dissipating the worries that fill your body.

In the countryside, enjoying the cool air is even more enchanting. Beneath the bean trellises and melon frames, not only is the breeze cool, but the evening scenery is picturesque. Surrounding you are all kinds of sights that inspire your poetic spirit: the ink-blue starry sky, the fireflies with the tips of their tails flashing purple and green light, the loud croaking of frogs in the pond or stream, and the low chirping of insects in the grass or rubble. Being in the midst of it all is like a dream.

Many people like to sit quietly while enjoying the cool air. Besides sitting quietly, some also like to drink alone. I do not have the good fortune to enjoy the rich and poetic flavor of drinking alone while enjoying the cool air, but I can imagine that the flavor must be very good, because I have seen a friend who has the habit of drinking every time he enjoys the cool air, and he drinks a lot. It is not until close to curfew that he staggeringly waves a large banana leaf fan and returns to his room to sleep. According to him, drinking alcohol while enjoying the cool air does not lead to excessive intoxication, because the cool breeze is blowing, and the mind will not become confused. Usually, if you can drink three cups, at this time you can drink at least five cups.

But many people—especially a group of lively children—always like to "chat endlessly" while enjoying the cool air, talking about ancient geography. The "Classic of Mountains and Seas" was originally an ancient book dedicated to describing strange events in the four seas, but now the story of how the eastern neighbor's sister-in-law raised an illegitimate child and how the western neighbor's master made a fortune have all become part of the "Classic of Mountains and Seas." However, recently, due to the different environment from the past, everyone is troubled and worried by the hardships of life, so there is no leisure to chat endlessly and talk about ancient geography. When they meet, they still complain: commodity prices are rising day by day, how difficult it is to make money, and how will we get through the days ahead? Thinking about these difficult-to-solve life problems, everyone frowns and becomes uneasy. Although a cool breeze is blowing from all directions, it may instead cause a fit of sweating.

A poor friend said: If we have to worry about how we will live in the future, then the only thing to do is to commit suicide as soon as possible. Therefore, after a busy day, it is best to just lay down and fall asleep in a daze. It is not too late to talk about tomorrow's life when it dawns. —His words are actually heartfelt, but in a pigeon-cage-like house, which is hot and stuffy, with bedbugs crawling all over the mat and pillow, waiting to "suck blood," it is impossible to fall asleep in a daze, so there is no choice but to sleep outdoors.

It is said that sleeping outdoors is also very pleasant. The blue sky is the curtain, the earth is the mattress, and waking up in the middle of the night, the cool dew drips on your body—this return to primitive life is also quite enchanting. Every summer night, the alleys and roads are filled with people sleeping in disarray. Some are bare-chested, some are cross-legged, some are huddled up like frogs, and some are bent over like shrimp meat. Human nature is fully revealed.

Currently, due to the earlier curfew time, many people do not dare to sleep outdoors on the road. Occasionally, there are a few ignorant people who are greedy for the cool air and still do their own thing. As a result, they are often caught and taken into the car while still sleepy. Someone who suffered from it once joked: "After sleeping outdoors, I'm getting a ride. How many times can one experience this in life!"

### Seeking Multiple Outlets: Public Bonds Fall Back

The off-exchange trading of public bonds initially saw a small decline due to Qian Yi releasing bonds, but then rebounded as Xinhua Bank and Xinji Company absorbed them. Ultimately, the price fell due to an oversupply of sellers. The futures market has not yet arrived, nor has it sold off. Compared to Tongli, the revenue is still incoming, but the market price has already fallen, although sentiment does not seem to be declining. However, as many parties are still seeking outlets, there is some cause for concern. Market sentiment is easygoing, with no special circumstances, so it is feared that it will inevitably return to a state of fluctuation. As a result, the market price uniformly fell by five to eight jiao. The transaction volume was approximately one million yuan. A concise table is provided below:

Category   Highest   Lowest   Closing   Compared to Previous Day

Unified A  38.30   37.80   37.80   Down 0.10

### Price of Gold Ornaments Decreases

Yesterday, the price quoted by the Daxin Tonghang jewelry stores in the city for gold ornaments was initially 2,250 yuan per tael, but around 10 o'clock, it was lowered by 50 yuan to 2,200 yuan (with a reduction of about 300 yuan for purchases). This was mainly due to intra-industry trading, and despite the situation of limited supply and high demand, the price fell from 1,970 yuan to 1,940 yuan per tael. At noon, it was 1,950 yuan, and then it was lowered by another 30 to 40 yuan. As for silver ornaments, the price was reduced by 1 yuan per tael, with Daxin Tonghang uniformly quoting 110 yuan.

### Cigarette Distribution and Sales Are Both Quiet

Cigarettes: The market prices of various brands, including Lai Shang, Zhong Shang, and Shang, are trending towards stagnation. Due to the narrowing sales channels during the rural cleanup period in various villages, the gap between the listed price and the market price is quite large. Recently, the factory's semi-wholesale distribution has been more active, while other distributors have been suspending distribution for a long time. Dealers who obtain goods from the factory mostly sell them at cost, so they are willing to stop placing warehouse orders, resulting in a standstill in both distribution and sales. Yesterday's transactions included Da Ying brand at 8,650 yuan, Lao Dao brand at 5,400 yuan, Pin Hai brand at 4,600 yuan, Wu Hua brand at 3,500 yuan, Xian Nv brand at 3,650 yuan, Fifty Branches of Cigarette at 14,000 yuan per 10,000, Da Nan at 12,800 yuan, San Wu brand at 11,500 yuan, Da Pao Tai at 8,000 yuan, Da Qian Men at 2,200 yuan, and twenty branches of Da Nan for 200 branches priced at 170 yuan, Da Qian Men at 45 yuan, Pei Ling at 48 yuan, Japanese Smoke Jin Qiang brand at 1,320 yuan, Jin Da Lou brand at 1,900 yuan, Hong Mei Gui brand at 925 yuan, Jin Lu brand at 1,650 yuan, Zhi Nan brand at 1,200 yuan, National Smoke Jin Shu brand at 1,500 yuan, Mei Li brand at 2,800 yuan, and Jin Zi Ta brand at 2,900 yuan, all trending weakly.

Spring and Autumn

### Endorsing the Sublease Method

— Mueran

The rent disputes in Shanghai have never really been resolved with a fair and just method, especially since the incident, becoming a haven for secondary landlords. Empty houses are being rented out with huge transfer fees, and illegal commissions are being demanded for subletting surplus rooms. The four basic necessities of life – clothing, food, housing, and transportation – are being manipulated by a portion of the city's secondary landlords. Clothing can be economized, food is being distributed, and transportation is similarly accessible, but housing, which is essential for citizens, is being controlled by them. Primary landlords have meager profits, while tertiary tenants bear heavy burdens. Only Shanghai residents who neither own property nor are necessarily required to reside there can rely on this lease agreement to reap undue profits. We firmly believe that this phenomenon must be reformed, even eliminated.

The announcement by the Public Works Department on the 15th regarding the "Methods for the Distribution of Rental Income for Subleased Housing by Secondary Landlords" caught our attention. This is an event that thoroughly benefits Shanghai citizens. The provisions stipulated in the methods can be said to be quite detailed. If they can be strictly implemented, the unfair and unjust situation of rent over the years can certainly be improved. With the promulgation of these new methods, we have a few thoughts that the authorities may have already considered. We will use them as a simple narrative based on assisting in the satisfactory progress of this rent issue.

There are several reasons why the rent in Shanghai has created various unreasonable situations: the excess of floating capital, with some people engaging in buying and selling real estate as a business, buying a certain number of houses today, collecting transfer fees from several new tenants, and selling them at the same price after some time, having already earned a considerable amount of transfer fees; secondary landlords renting houses, and immediately renting them out as soon as it is profitable, with floating capital allowing them to rent in and out at any time, so that tertiary tenants become the carpets of the old and new secondary landlords, arbitrarily exploiting them. Especially in the current situation of rationing based on population, tertiary tenants lack the courage to refuse the demands of secondary landlords to increase rent. In fact, any tertiary tenant, at a time when moving is difficult and commissions are expensive, can only endure the pain of the current rent increase. Moreover, the weight of the positions of tertiary tenants and secondary landlords often prevents people from seeing things in the same way. The authorities' concern for tertiary tenants can be said to be exhaustive. In various environments, tertiary tenants are ultimately exploited by secondary landlords. This is a common phenomenon and the common feeling of tertiary tenants.

We strongly endorse the regulations of the new methods of the Public Works Department. We advocate strict management of today's changes in tenants of houses, eliminating the malpractices of transferring in and out. If a household rents a house that exceeds the scope of its required use, it must state the reasons. The penalties for collecting transfer fees and commissions must be strictly enforced, and at the same time, the lease of the house in its location must be immediately terminated, and its criminal part must be dealt with according to law. The parties who pay the transfer fees and commissions may also submit a report within a certain period after their lease to await investigation. Those who do not report to the authorities within a certain period will be fined after investigation.

We believe that to solve the rent problem in Shanghai, it is necessary to strictly prohibit transfer fees, commissions, digging fees, etc., while penalizing those who rent a house and fail to use it without justifiable reason for a considerable period. According to the new methods of the Public Works Department, there must be no hesitation or opportunistic behavior, and then the rent problem can be perfectly resolved.

We look forward to the publication of detailed methods by the Public Works Department. We sincerely hope that after the methods are published, no one will dare to break the law, and the rent problem in Shanghai can be clarified.

### Song of Summer

— Yinsheng

A friend is studying music, and he is trying to complete a great piece of music, praising the beautiful and lyrical "Summer." Therefore, he spends every day in parks, cafes, and even dance halls, searching for the "Song of Summer."

I eagerly look forward to the completion of his piece of music, but one day he ran to see me sweating profusely and said despairingly:

"I can't find the 'Song of Summer' anymore! It's just a kind of noise, with no beautiful melody or lyrical mood, only suffocating sweat and annoying dust."

I sympathized with his encounter, and at the same time I told him:

"The music narrowly confined in parks and cafes is just wearing a beautiful mask. Running out of the cafe still can't get rid of the heat. The call on the strings of the public's hearts is the best music. 'The Song of Summer' cannot forget the sweat and dust."

My friend realized, he raised his hands and said resolutely:

"I will use rough tunes to play the sweat full of labor, the resentment accumulated in my heart, and I will also use rushing melodies to play the coming of storms, thunder roaring, rain screaming... washing away all the dirt and driving away the heat!"

Therefore, I look forward to the completion of his piece of music even more eagerly.

### Sharing the Same Boat in Storms

— He Jiaji

(7) Quick Thunder

Wei Cheng said: "I'm not going, and I'm not bored either. I feel very happy. I now know how to save money. I don't want to spend one or two hundred yuan for a moment of pleasure for no reason. Starting tomorrow, I will start sorting out the essays and poems written by my grandfather, father, and uncles. I have work to do." Second Madam Ye said: "It's also wrong to just read books and write. You can also visit your uncle's house and aunt's house. They all love you very much. Even in the afternoon, when the sun is setting, you can go to a small teahouse to drink a bowl of tea. It doesn't cost much money, and it's the most comfortable thing to do. If you were a wild horse, I wouldn't want you to go either. You're not like that. You won't go bad even if you mix with bad people. I hope you go. I heard there's going to be a war, and there are rumors often heard. What's going on? There's news in the small teahouses. Oh! Where is Huang Neng's teahouse? Can't you find him? In the fields, we've finally managed to get through the busiest time. It's okay to let A Xing go with you." Wei Cheng didn't refute the other words, but only said: "Auntie, you forgot, Huang Long committed a crime in Shanghai, and there was a letter. Where can I find him? That's right, if Huang Long was running a teahouse, I would really want to be a teahouse guest."

Because of Wei Shaoyun's arrival, they talked straight to Huang Long, so the chat was indefinite. Second Madam Ye initially felt that after all, he was not her own son, and he hadn't been willing to do anything she wanted him to do; later, she thought that Wei Cheng's failure to do so couldn't be considered Wei Cheng's fault, so she comforted him a few words and left. From then on, Wei Cheng really buried himself in old paper piles, forcing his gray heart to go in a small range. He naturally didn't ask about the affairs of the fields; he also did this less often when he looked up at the Chen siblings; even Cui Zhen secretly took care of his tea and water, taking care of his cold and warmth, but he didn't say a word of gratitude. He first collected his grandfather's handwritten works, and transcribed everything, even a letter that someone gave to his grandfather. In the great heat, he never thought about being harmed by the sun. This time, sorting out the posthumous works of Guangren, he turned out all the books in the Shuangmei Study and dried them. He often found bits and pieces of writing by his grandfather, father, and uncles in the books. (130)

### The Philosophy of Wearing a Raincoat

— Sha

There are not many days of mold rain this year. These days, the red sun is in the sky, and the fire umbrella is high, and there are people planning straw hats on their heads. If we say that they are "preparing for a rainy day," I am afraid that only one in ten will plan to buy raincoats, parasols, or galoshes. We often hear people say, "If I had known... the price would rise... why didn't I buy it... You can add any number here. If you feel that the price of undershirts is too expensive, then add five pieces or a dozen pieces, etc.)..." Yes, if the weather is very good today, it would be somewhat inappropriate for me to use raincoats as the topic; conversely, if it suddenly rains today, this article can be said to be "timely." In short, even if it doesn't rain today, there will be rainy days anyway, so there is no need to compare the length of one day.

A few days ago, I talked to Mr. Chen Hanquan of the raincoat industry (we didn't say anything like "Why doesn't it rain so quickly?" The so-called chat is just talking about everything). I feel that ordinary people are somewhat careless in handling raincoats. A raincoat is often taken care of when it is new, but after it gets old, after it has aged, it is only worn on rainy days and has a little contact with "nature." On other days, it is either hung in the corner of the wall or on a clothes rack: covered in dust, the color fading, like a splash-ink landscape painting. Some more confused people may hang it in a dark corner for three months or half a year. Although they deal with themselves, there is no need to worry about moth or rat bites, listening to fate." However, this raincoat is worn on the body, it is really called heavy rain outside, light rain inside.

The function of a raincoat seems very simple, only to prevent rain. But when you think about it carefully, it has infinite uses: young guys comb their hair neatly, with a light raincoat wrapped around their arms, in a nonchalant way, dragging it along, looking particularly chic. If the posture is appropriate, a middle-aged man's raincoat is like a cane or a dog leash, enhancing masculine beauty. Wearing an old-fashioned rubber-lined raincoat weighing more than ten pounds, you can't walk fast, you must be disciplined, and it makes people respect you even more." If you wear it for an hour or so in the late spring and early summer, walking around on the road for two or three laps, it will give you the effect of a Turkish bath. Under any circumstances, having a raincoat on a rainy day (not to mention a parasol) can get you at least a 10% or 12.5% discount on rickshaws.

The material of raincoats should be light and delicate. Therefore, good raincoats are as light as a feather, while old-fashioned raincoats are as heavy as Mount Tai, which must be distinguished. Ladies have recently been wearing a kind of silk transparent raincoat, which is certainly not bad, but you must also have self-awareness. One rainy night, I was looking out from the building, and I saw a young woman wearing a brand-new lemon-colored transparent raincoat, but unfortunately she lacked a healthy physique. The raincoat made her look even more skinny, with a feeling of "Xiaoxiang Night Rain," making people sad.

The rainproof scarf on women's heads is said to be copied from "Long Live Women One Thousand." I hope that people who run raincoat materials can also think about men. A raincoat should of course be as light as a feather, otherwise, at least avoid "steam baths." If we can "Long Live Ladies, Long Live Gentlemen," wouldn't that be immeasurable merit!

### Friendship

— Chun

True friendship is like health, only realized how precious it is when it is lost.

Don't rely on gifts to gain a friend, you must dedicate your sincere love and learn how to win a person's heart in the right way.

Mother's love is certainly great, but it is only selfish and narrow-minded. Romantic love is also like this. Only sincere friendship is great, selfless, and broad.

### Shanghai in the Summer of 1942

— Yuan Ying

The mercury in the thermometer has crossed ninety degrees, and it is still slowly climbing upwards. The high heat and scorching sun make everyone fall into a suffocating state of lethargy, with rolling beads of sweat flowing endlessly, as if never to rest.

In Shanghai in the summer of 1942, the newspapers were filled with headlines saying: "The whole city is boiling!"

There are still many pedestrians on the road, and even if the sun shines mercilessly on their heads and bodies, it still can't stop the people who are running around. Life, let's not compare it with before! Even last summer, it was several times different. In this era, who can have the time to be idle at home!

Of course, the people who are running around in the sunlight are not all for life, and the people who are for life are not all on the road, but "still working in the humid heat" is the same! Even going to a cold drink shop, going to the swimming pool, or even riding a bicycle, are all working. The waiters in the ice cream parlors run back and forth carrying cups, the ticket sellers in the swimming pools tear tickets non-stop, and even the large trucks of Pushan Villa run in the sunlight... These should all be special jobs in the summer!

But finally something went wrong!

"True cholera was discovered in Nanshi... There have been many cases..."

So it was sealed off all around, and the cholera germs continued to spread, and people were sent to the hospital in batches...

This is not accidental! It is inevitable! Shanghai has a large population of several million, which is enough to have the qualification to "discover true cholera"! In addition, after the price of rice soared, people could not get enough nutrition from corn flour and soybean noodles, so resistance can be said to have almost disappeared. Even if everyone has a "vaccination paper," what's the use?

However, at the same time, the prosperity of cold drink shops is no less than in previous years. Even though one yuan now is worth two yuan before, people's vision has increased with the standard of living, so a popsicle sells for five jiao a piece (which is one yuan before, ten times higher than last year!). There are still people clamoring "cheap"! Similarly, two yuan for soda and seven yuan for ice bricks are not expensive!

After cars disappeared, driving is not affected! Horse carriages are good. Tricycles are slow, but also quite chic. Although some people have invented the economical "trolley driving," which costs seven jiao to drive more than ten miles, people who really want to drive in Shanghai will never bother to take the trolley! How shabby!

For comfort, people don't care about a few "big" ones! — These Shanghai people are still rich after all.
