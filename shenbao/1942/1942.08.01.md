### German Defenses on the Western European Coast are Impenetrable; Hundreds of New Airfields Built; France Denies Submarine Use by Germany

Paris, 31st, Haitian News Agency dispatch: This morning, Parisian newspapers unanimously published in prominent positions the remarks of the French young engineer Roussel. Roussel assisted in the construction of German defenses on the northern coast of France. It is said that the French worked very well with the Germans in charge of managing the project. The German defense project is excellent. I know the Maginot Line quite well, but the defense line built by the Germans on the Atlantic coast and near the English Channel is even stronger. Such a great defense project is unprecedented in history.

Berlin, 31st, Haitian News Agency dispatch: Well-informed sources here point out that along the European coast, from Biarritz along the Atlantic, the English Channel, and the North Sea to Kirkenes, the Germans have built and renovated no less than hundreds of airfields. This is the base for German fighter planes and destroyers. Although the German army is building various military facilities in Western Europe, the German army continues to advance fiercely on the Eastern European front.

Vichy, 30th, Havas News Agency dispatch: Recently, newspapers in both the free and occupied zones of France have often spoken of the eventual opening of a second battlefield by Britain and the United States. The newspapers have also learned from German military circles that the German army is fully prepared for the Allied invasion of the Western European coast in the future, and the defenses, especially along the French coast, are particularly strong. The German troops stationed in the occupied zone of France are constantly training and have never slackened. A recent German exercise in northern France shows that the "Third Operations Bureau" of the German General Staff has studied the possibility of an invasion of the European continent by the Anglo-American Allied Forces. Since 1940, Britain has been extremely active along the French coast, but each attack has been carried out by a small number of "strike teams", so no shocking events have occurred. Regardless of the fact that the Western European coast has not yet been threatened, the German side is still mobilizing a large number of German troops to the occupied zone of France to increase defenses. French newspapers therefore believe that General Lundstedt, commander-in-chief of the German forces in the occupied zone of France, has taken all possible precautions in case of emergency. Moreover, German armored vehicle teams have been concentrated at various strategic points, and any point on the coast that is attacked in the future can be rushed to reinforce it. The German defenses are very solid, especially along the North Sea coast, which can be called the Siegfried Line. Behind the front line, there are also positions to deal with tanks. Since the signing of the armistice agreement, France has been in a special position, so French newspapers believe that the German measures are purely military in nature and do not have any political significance. As for the French authorities, they can only take safety measures to ensure that the general public will not suffer from the war again. For example, children have begun to be evacuated along the coast and sent to safe areas inland.

Vichy, 30th, Havas News Agency dispatch: The Naval Department has just released the following communiqué: "A certain authoritative British newspaper strongly asserted that one thousand German naval officers and soldiers are now in the ports of Toulon and Villefranche in France, in order to be equipped on twenty to thirty French submarines and wait to be sent to Germany for use. In view of the serious responsibility of this false report by the British newspaper, the French Naval Department has decided to break its usual silence and announce to the world that the rumors about France dispatching any fleet to Germany or German sailors arriving in Toulon and Villefranche are absolutely untrue."

### Britain's Policy Toward India Will Not Change

Stockholm, 31st, Haitian News Agency dispatch: According to news from London, after a speech by Amery, the British Secretary of State for India, Labour MP Shinwell demanded that the government should continue to reach an understanding with India.

At the same time, he expressed regret over the Indian Congress Party's refusal to negotiate and its attempt to overthrow the current political system in India. Amery gave a warning to the Indian Congress Party, saying that this attitude of the Indian Congress Party may force the British government of India to take all necessary measures to suppress possible revolutionary activities. The British government hopes that sober-minded people in India will not support the claims of the Congress Party and will promote the war effort of the Allied countries. The British government will guarantee India's complete freedom after the war as a reward.

London, 30th, Havas News Agency dispatch: Indian Affairs Minister Amery announced in the House of Commons that the Indian Communist Party newspapers "National Friend" and "New Era" have been allowed to resume publication. Communist Party members who were previously imprisoned for promoting communism have also been released since announcing their participation in the Allied front. The remaining detained Communist Party members will be dealt with separately on a case-by-case basis. At this point, a member asked whether Sir Cripps's previous proposal would remain valid after the war. Amery replied that the government's future plans would not be bound by the current attitude of Parliament, just as they are not bound at present. As for guaranteeing our country's commercial interests in India, it is not a basic condition for our country to accept the Indian constitution.

### Jiang Tingfu and Others Go to India

### German Troops Cross the Don River for Reinforcements, Soviet Resistance Remains Strong, Germany Denies Attacking the Taman Peninsula, Soviet Counteroffensive Wins at Voronezh

Stockholm, 31st (Havas) – Although the Soviet troops' resistance is increasingly strong, the German offensive against Stalingrad is still advancing strongly. Moscow admits that German troops have crossed the Don River in several places. Stalingrad is now most threatened from the north, where the German casualties are almost half, but a large number of fresh troops have arrived for reinforcements. Fresh German troops have also arrived west and southwest of Stalingrad, and the Soviet troops are blocking them to prevent them from crossing the Volga River and approaching Stalingrad from the flanks and the rear. As for the south, it was confirmed yesterday that the Krasnodar-Stalingrad railway has been cut off in several places. However, according to rumors from Berlin, there is still a railway line in the Caucasus, along the Caspian Sea coast to Astrakhan. Although this route has not been found on various maps, the Soviet Union has repeatedly discovered secret railways and highways in the evolution of the war, so the existence of this secret railway is to be expected. After several days of silence in the Voronezh area, the Soviet troops have launched an offensive again and have recovered two locations on Tuesday, it is said.

Moscow, 31st (Havas) – Moscow Radio officially announced today that yesterday, Soviet troops continued to attack enemy positions on the west bank of a certain river south of Voronezh, supported by airplanes and artillery.

The German plan seems to be to launch a pincer attack to cut off the Red Army's retreat route on the south bank of the lower Don River.

Berlin, 31st (Haitong) – Marshal Bock's troops continue to advance in various areas of the southern route, so the position of General Timoshenko's troops is becoming increasingly critical today. According to official announcements, the German-Romanian allied forces drove the enemy across the river at multiple points in the Don River bend. German troops have already reached the key railway hub of Kushchevskaya, and fierce fighting is currently underway at the Lask point southeast of Rostov. The Soviet troops retreating from the lower Don River have become a rout, and German troops are now pursuing them in two directions, one advancing south from Rostov and the other having passed through Proletarskaya. Although Berlin officials have not disclosed the details of the German advance in the Manych area, it is believed that the German troops are continuing to advance south, and the German vanguard has already reached points 180 to 200 kilometers south of the Don River. In the battles in the Don River basin, the Soviet troops are putting up a strong resistance in the mountains northwest and southwest of Kalach on the west bank of the Don River. Italian troops have made great contributions in this battle. The rumor that German troops have crossed the Don River west of Stalingrad has not yet been confirmed by the General Staff. The military here believes that the rumor that German troops have crossed the sea from the Kerch Peninsula to the Taman Peninsula is purely a fantasy.

Lisbon, 30th (Alliance) – According to an announcement by the German commander on the 30th, German troops who crossed the Sal River south of the Don River have continued to advance south, breaking into Proletarskaya, a key point on the railway line between Stalingrad and Krasnodar, and have completely occupied it, cutting off the railway line. Proletarskaya is located 50 kilometers southeast of Rostov, on the upper reaches of the Manych Canal, and occupies an important position for land and water transportation. The German occupation of this area has completely isolated western North Caucasus from the Soviet mainland, putting it in a state of isolation.

### Soviet Union Appeals to Britain and the United States to Open a Second Front, Litvinov Meets with Roosevelt

Lisbon, 30th (Alliance) – According to reports from Reuters, London, after the British House of Commons discussed the Allied landing operation plan in Europe on the 30th, a symposium was convened by several members of parliament, chaired by the Secretary-General of the Liberal Party, Harris. The Soviet Ambassador to Britain, Maisky, explained the war situation on various fronts and the current situation in the Soviet Union, and answered questions from British members of parliament. He emphasized that opening a second front by the British and American forces at this time is a matter of utmost urgency.

Lisbon, 30th (Alliance) – According to a Reuters dispatch from Washington, the Soviet Ambassador to the United States, Litvinov, visited President Roosevelt at the presidential residence on the afternoon of the 30th and had a cordial conversation for 15 minutes. Afterwards, he met with a group of reporters and avoided commenting on the content of the meeting.

Stockholm, 31st (Haitong) – According to a London dispatch this morning, the Soviet Ambassador to Britain, Maisky, delivered a speech at a meeting of a small number of members of the British Parliament yesterday, emphasizing the critical situation in the Soviet Union. According to the official report, the members of parliament present were very moved by Maisky's speech. Informed sources in London believe that Maisky's remarks are directly related to the meeting between the Soviet Ambassador to the United States, Litvinov, and Roosevelt yesterday afternoon. British political figures said that Stalin must have instructed the ambassadors to Britain and the United States to step up the movement for British and American aid to the Soviet Union and the opening of a second front.

London, 30th (Havas) – A delegation of British women, representing female workers from various military equipment factories and the families of soldiers on the front lines, went to the House of Commons today to petition for the opening of a second battlefield.

Lisbon, 31st (Haitong) – Senior officials in Washington, under pressure from public opinion, have now admitted that the United States government is considering establishing a second front in Europe. Officials in Washington revealed in a statement issued on Thursday that there are differing opinions in the United States regarding the second front issue. In addition, American newspapers have stopped promoting the second front since Wednesday. The "Washington Post," known for its well-informed sources, said last night, "The establishment of a second front is only in the air. This cannot alleviate the pressure on the Soviet Union from the German army, which is deeply regrettable." The newspaper strongly advocated for a second front, but now believes that Britain's intensified air activity against Germany proves that an effective counteroffensive against Germany cannot be realized at this time.

Berlin, 30th (Havas) – A spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said today that in the past 48 hours, except for one or two small newspapers in Britain, all other newspapers have stopped their enthusiastic discussions about opening a second battlefield and are instead talking about the difficulties and dangers of this attempt. The sudden change in attitude of British propaganda is perplexing.

Stockholm, 31st (Haitong) – According to reports from London, the Allied forces in Western Europe will establish a joint supreme command, and the most popular candidate for this position is the U.S. Army Chief of Staff, General Marshall. However, British newspapers such as the "Daily Mirror" do not support the appointment of an American general as the commander of the British army, saying that Marshall has no practical combat experience, while there is no shortage of British generals with combat experience. How can Marshall be the commander of the British and American Allied forces?

The bread coupons are attached with tear-off tickets, one of which is used daily and is sufficient for one month. The tear-off tickets can be used on the day of issuance and the next day, but bread cannot be sold in advance.

The authorities will allocate yellow and white bread coupons to each bread company and its retail stores based on the number of people registered with them, for redistribution, and will allocate flour based on the number of tear-off tickets they return.

### Refusal of New Registrations

Except in special circumstances, the authorities do not intend to accept new registrations for bread supply from rice ticket holders. Other people who wish to obtain bread should personally come to Office No. 160B of the Council to apply. Therefore, bread companies and their retail stores must not accept registration forms afterwards unless approved by the authorities. However, users who wish to change the store supplying bread will be allowed to register without approval from the authorities. A fee of 5 yuan will be charged for each such registration. Any changes in the number and address of registrants should be reported to the above-mentioned office immediately. It is hoped that all consumers, other retail stores, and bread companies will strictly comply with the above-mentioned measures so that the bread supply can continue smoothly.

### British and American Insurance Companies to Periodically Refund Insurance Premiums, to be issued within one month starting from August 1st.

According to the Alliance News Agency, eleven British and American insurance companies, following the order of the highest commander of the Japanese army in this city, have been under the supervision of the Central China Liaison Department of the Asia Development Board since April 11th of this year, and are being liquidated by Japanese insurance companies. The amount of debt of nine of the companies has been fully determined, so it has been decided to start paying out insurance money or returning cancellation fees based on the insurance contracts of each insurance company (in legal tender or military scrip) within one month starting from August 1st. The Central China Liaison Department of the Asia Development Board formally announced this on the 31st. In addition, the American International Assurance Company and the Wing Foong Life Assurance Company are still continuing their liquidation and will be announced separately. Furthermore, the above-mentioned insurance money and cancellation refunds will also be issued simultaneously in North China, South China, and Hankou from August 1st.

British and American life insurance companies being liquidated: Trust companies: Federal, Mitsui Life, British Fourth Seas, Mitsui Life, Hong Leong, Mitsui Life, United States, Imperial Life, Wing On, Chiyoda Life, Wing Ming, Meiji Life, Wing Lok, Tomita Collection, and San Francisco, Japan Fire. The Asia Development Board authorities issued the following statement on this matter: Under the supervision of this Board, enemy insurance companies have been undergoing liquidation by Japanese insurance companies entrusted by the military since April 11th of this year. The process has been very smooth, and the amount of debt of each insurance company has been fully determined. Therefore, it has been decided to issue insurance money or cancellation refunds based on the insurance contracts (in legal tender or military scrip) within one month starting from August 1st. As for the place of issuance, it will be within the respective Japanese insurance companies entrusted with the liquidation. Those who have entered into insurance contracts in legal tender or military scrip with the above-mentioned enemy insurance companies are requested to prepare the procedures for receiving the money immediately. However, the issuance of cancellation refunds is limited to those who have applied for cancellation. In addition, the American International Assurance Company will need to postpone the matter for some time due to administrative reasons, and a separate announcement will be made after a decision is made.

### Lieutenant Colonel Yokoyama Talks About Air Defense Preparations

According to the local branch of the Alliance News Agency, at a reception for journalists yesterday, Lieutenant Colonel Yokoyama, a spokesman for the Japanese Army, ridiculed the rumor that air defense measures will be implemented here because the war is getting closer to Shanghai. According to reports, the Japanese authorities are only preparing for various possibilities. Air defense measures must be implemented because Chongqing is firmly requesting that the United States send more airplanes. The Japanese side is taking active measures to destroy its base, or to counter the number of airplanes that the United States will be able to supply to Chongqing. Lieutenant Colonel Yokoyama said that he believed this kind of weapons assistance could only be taken in a "perfunctory" manner. He also believes that American aircraft have failed to conduct organized and effective air warfare against the Japanese side, but there is a possibility of carrying out air guerrilla warfare against the occupied areas, and therefore air defense preparations are being made.

### Proclamation by the Japanese Military Authorities in This City: Citizens Should Obey Air Defense Regulations

According to the Alliance News Agency, in view of the importance of air defense in this city, the highest authorities of the Japanese Army and Navy in this city have taken comprehensive air defense measures. The highest commanders of the Army and Navy have issued a proclamation, and the Army and Navy Garrison Authorities have issued a statement, hoping that the general public will strictly abide by the air defense regulations. The proclamation states that all citizens residing in Shanghai should fulfill the obligation to comply with the various regulations related to civil air defense stipulated by the relevant authorities. July 29th, 31st year of Showa. Highest Commanders of the Army and Navy. In addition, the Army and Navy Garrison Authorities issued a statement saying that regarding air defense measures, in view of the importance of this city, the Japanese military authorities have taken careful measures. Moreover, the elite aviation units of the Japanese army took preemptive actions and repeatedly attacked the enemy's air bases, destroying their air power. Therefore, to this day, Shanghai has no danger of air raids, and the citizens can all live and work in peace. It is extremely gratifying. However, as the Greater East Asia War develops into a world war, when considering the mobility of airplanes, it cannot be said that Shanghai will absolutely not be the target of aerial guerrilla warfare. Therefore, regarding civil air defense, we should always take a foolproof approach with a "be prepared for the worst" attitude. Therefore, this time, the highest commanders of the Army and Navy have issued a proclamation, imposing on the citizens of Shanghai the obligation to comply with the various regulations related to civil air defense stipulated by the relevant authorities. The Shanghai Garrison and the Shanghai Naval Special Landing Force, the former being the Shanghai Army Air Defense Command and the latter being the Shanghai Naval Air Defense Command, guide the municipal government, the Shanghai Municipal Council, and the Japanese Consulate Police on matters related to civil air defense. The municipal government, the Shanghai Municipal Council, and the Japanese Consulate Police guide the general public to implement air defense measures. It is hoped that all citizens of Shanghai will strictly abide by the regulations and instructions regarding air defense issued by the authorities.

### Attention All Students Applying for Scholarships: Instructions for the Examination; Those Who Have Not Received Their Examination Permits Must Pick Them Up Today

The Shenbao's third scholarship for readers, since the application registration deadline on the 28th of last month, has been rushed for preliminary review and examination procedures. The admission tickets for the primary and secondary school exams have been distributed in the past two days. Those who attend the exam must bring their admission ticket. Those who do not attend the exam will be deemed to have given up and will have their application qualifications revoked. Those who have not yet received their exam admission tickets must bring their registration certificate to the business counter of this office today to pick them up.

Examination Instructions

Please pay attention to the following points when taking the exam: Bring a pencil and eraser (do not bring an ink pen); Enter the seat according to the number on the exam ticket; Do not bring books, but white paper may be prepared for calculations and drafts; If the blank space on the composition test paper is not enough, it can be written on the back; Obey the time limit and submit the paper on time; Leave immediately after submitting the paper; If cheating or other situations are discovered, the qualification will be immediately cancelled; The examination will be held in groups. Primary school graduates will be included in junior high school, and junior high school graduates will be included in senior high school. Although the levels may differ by two or three years, the test questions for each group will include the curriculum for each grade in that group. The grading standard will also be based on the subject matter of each group and each grade and the qualifications of each individual; Please indicate the grade you have completed on the exam paper.

Significance of the Examination

Based on the past two times of handling scholarship work, the colleagues of this newspaper deeply feel that the scoring system for students' homework in various schools in Shanghai is quite inconsistent in terms of strictness and leniency. Therefore, it is difficult to achieve a general standard in terms of reviewing grades. Although exams are not an ideal and perfect method, they are still a relatively concrete standard. This time, due to the expensive tuition fees of various schools, although donations from all walks of life are extremely enthusiastic, and at the same time, this newspaper has vigorously promoted donation matters, it is inevitable to sigh that there is too little porridge for too many monks, and it is difficult to allocate. In terms of the number of applicants, the number of approved recipients must be at least halved. The difficulty of the review work can be imagined. Colleagues really can't bear to go against the students' hopes of receiving assistance. In order to be fair, this selection examination has great significance. In short, diligent and hardworking youth will never find the exam difficult. For those foreign language schools such as Aurora Middle School, Xuhui Public School, and Huishi Elementary School, where French is the main subject, the test this time is English. This special situation will be considered and handled again after graduation.

Charity Ball Game

Yuanguanball is a novel sports competition, and the Shanghai ball is a sensation for a while. Now, Qiu Changyin, Fan Lipei, Zhang Mingsheng and other gentlemen, in order to respond to the scholarship movement for readers of this newspaper, specially initiated the Yuanguanball Charity Competition, and the proceeds will be donated to the public, without deducting expenses, and donated to the scholarship of this newspaper and the loan scholarship of the Xinwen Bao. In addition, accountant Wang Sifang is willing to audit the ticket money free of charge, which is admirable. It is scheduled to be held at the Guangxia Middle School ball court on the afternoon of August 9th and August 16th. The "Changyin Cup Yuanguanball Charity Competition" is set, and the tickets are divided into two types: 5 yuan honor tickets and 2 yuan ordinary tickets. All income, without deducting expenses, will be donated to scholarships, and in order to be solemn, all tickets are stamped and issued by Wang Sifang, the director of the Yuanye Accounting Firm, it is said.

Saving Money for Scholarships

Yu Feng Peilan, a woman, wrote in a letter, "To the editor, August 1st is the tenth anniversary of the death of my late husband, Yu Guanbin. In view of the increasing number of out-of-school children in Shanghai, I have specially saved the money for chanting scriptures and rituals, totaling one thousand yuan, to donate 500 yuan each to your newspaper's scholarship and the Xinwen Bao's loan scholarship. A small amount, just to express my humble intentions. " Yesterday, we received donations from you for scholarships, including Ms. Yu Feng Peilan (saving scripture costs for the tenth anniversary of the death of her late husband, Yu Qinbin) 500 yuan, Shen Ji 500 yuan, Ye Shaozhou 10 yuan, Gao Muqian 4 yuan, a total of 1,014 yuan in Central Reserve Certificates.

According to personnel engaged in vaccination work, the number of people applying for vaccination has increased this Wednesday. A total of 18,492 people in the French Concession were vaccinated on that day, and a similar number of citizens in the International Settlement were also vaccinated. It is said that the reason for the surge in the number of people vaccinated in the French Concession is that citizens from Nanshi entered the French Concession and were vaccinated by the road vaccination team. The number of people vaccinated on July 30 has not yet been accurately counted, but it is expected that nearly 40,000 people in the two concessions applied for vaccination on this day.

### Household Checks to Begin Today in the Mailan District; Subsequent Household Registration Transfers Must Be Approved First

The Mailan District Police Headquarters of the French Concession issued a notice to its affiliated Lianbao offices yesterday, saying, "Household registration changes should be reported at any time. However, each district has been very negligent in the household registration clearing. This matter is of great importance and must be handled seriously. From August 1st, household registration will be checked. All household registration changes in each district must be filled out in accordance with the regulations and reported to the Lianbao office and then to the general district for approval before they can be moved.

Ding's Medicated Ointment Donated to Impoverished Students: Yesterday, we received 300 boxes of Ding's Medicated Ointment produced by the Hua Yi Pharmaceutical Factory, donated by Mr. Sun Daosheng, along with a letter from the factory, which reads: "To the Editor, your newspaper's promotion of the Qing'an Scholarship Movement is receiving an increasing number of responses. Its spirit of benefiting society and encouraging students is admired by people from all walks of life. Our factory is also willing to do its part and donate 300 boxes of Ding's Medicated Ointment for distribution to the students who have passed the scholarship requirements. Because these impoverished students' families often do not have adequate hygiene facilities, they are prone to heat boils, dampness, scabies, tinea, eczema, insect bites, boils, frostbite, and other external skin conditions. The Ding's Medicated Ointment produced by our factory is a good medicine suitable for these external skin conditions. This is addressed to the Shenbao Social Services column. Sincerely, Hua Yi Chemical Pharmaceutical Factory." An additional 50 boxes were distributed to colleagues at this office, with sincere thanks. (Note: This medicated ointment should be distributed separately among the students applying for the scholarship of this newspaper's readers.)

The Shanghai West Police Bureau previously handled the registration of radios within the district for a period of two months. The deadline for registration was originally scheduled to be July 15th. It is now announced that the registration period will be extended to the end of August. The registration fee is 5 yuan in Central Reserve Certificates per set. If unregistered radios are found after this deadline, they will be punished according to regulations. It is also learned that the deadline for radio registration in the French Concession has also been extended due to the slow printing of registration forms.

Parcel Postage to Double Starting Today

Starting from August 1st this year, the parcel postage between various bureaus in this district and to the following regions will increase from one yuan to two yuan per kilogram, and the postage for small packages will increase from 64 cents to 1.28 yuan per 100 cubic centimeters, including: Beijing, Hebei, Shanxi, Shandong, Henan (Kaifeng), Jiangsu, Anhui, Zhejiang (Hangzhou), Hubei (Hankou), Guangdong (Guangzhou), and other postal areas, as well as Xiamen, etc.

### July Cost of Living Index

In July of this year, the total cost of living index for Chinese workers, calculated based on the price of Central Reserve Certificates and using 1936 as the base year, was 2163.51, for Chinese staff it was 1625.87, and for Western staff it was 1391.43.

### A Stroll Through the Opera School (Continued)

— Zhi Yu

I asked, "Your school seems to be doing quite well in terms of modern opera performances, wouldn't you say?"

Mr. Guan smiled and said, "Since we started performing modern operas, we have been fortunate to receive support from all walks of life, so our results can't be considered bad. However, we only have matinee performances on Thursdays, Fridays, and Saturdays. If business is good, we can barely make ends meet, but if business is slow, we're bound to lose money. As for funding, we mostly rely on the support of a few board members, but because the expenses are huge, we can't make ends meet, and there's nothing we can do about it."

"We treat all students equally, regardless of whether they play leading or supporting roles. However, for business reasons, we only assign a few students who have made a deeper impression on the audience to sing more. Actually, in addition to the few relatively famous students we have now, there are many more who have great potential. I would like to give them more opportunities to show their faces in the future. The more they perform, the more experience they will gain."

"I imagine quite a few of your students are from opera families?" I asked.

"Not really. Most of our students come from poor families in the south. There are very few who are actually from opera families. But southern children are smarter than northern children. They can learn any opera at once. This is something that we teachers are very happy about." I then asked, "So, what are the classes like at your school?"

"We divide our teaching into academic and technical subjects. In the mornings, we teach academic subjects, such as Chinese language and general knowledge, to help them learn more characters, because the more characters they know, the easier it is for the teachers to teach them opera. We don't rely on rote memorization like the old-style opera schools. The students' level here ranges from first grade of elementary school to first grade of junior high school. The oldest is seventeen years old and the youngest is ten years old. As for technical subjects, that's practicing skills and reciting lines, and that takes place in the afternoon."

"Each student now receives a monthly allowance of forty yuan. Of course, we hope to be able to treat them better, but we can't think of a way to do so, given our financial constraints."

I then asked, "What is the graduation period for students?"

Mr. Guan said, "Here, we stipulate a six-year graduation period. After graduating, they help out at the school for another year, so it's a total of seven years. After leaving the school, we try our best to introduce them to performance opportunities. If they have the talent and the manpower, they can form their own performing troupe."

"What is the situation with the teachers' salaries at your school?"

"The teachers' salaries here are very meager. In the end, it all comes down to financial difficulties," Mr. Guan gave a wry smile, "but their spirit is admirable. Our veteran male role teachers are Mr. Chu Chenbin and Mr. Wu Baokui; the female role teachers are Mr. Chen Tongyun and Mr. Chen Yuemei; the painted-face and martial arts teachers are Mr. Liang Suzhu and Mr. Mu Shenglou; the Kunqu opera teachers are Mr. Zheng Chuanjian and Mr. Jiang Gengsun; the civil and military percussion teacher is Mr. Wang Xieyuan; and the instrumentalist is Mr. Zhao Dagang. There are a total of twenty-one civil and military teachers. The most invaluable is Mr. Shen Yanchen, a veteran martial arts performer. Mr. Shen is sixty-five years old this year, but he is still very energetic. He is currently the only veteran martial arts performer in the country who can teach students without using corporal punishment and achieve great results. There are no such figures as Mr. Shen even in Beiping."

As I was talking to Mr. Guan, I heard the students talking loudly about Zhao Songqiao, Cui Guangfu, Mao Jianqiu..., which shows that they have a very strong interest in opera!

Later, I chatted with Guan Zhengming, Zhang Zhengpeng, Chen Zhengyan, ... a group of young national opera performers. They were all innocent and lovely. Zhang Zhengpeng said, "Most of the students here are from Shanghai, and there are also some from Guangdong, but they can all speak beautiful and fluent Mandarin." Zhang Zhengpeng is from Shanghai, but he speaks very clear Beijing dialect.

When I saw that it was already 11 o'clock, I got up to say goodbye. Mr. Guan politely saw me downstairs. The Shanghai Drama School has a bright future, and I wish the young national opera performers a great future! I stepped out of the opera school with a happy heart.

### Song Dezhu and Li Hezeng Take the Stage, A Promising Start

— Plum Blossom Pavilion Owner

The new stars Song Dezhu, Li Hezeng, Wang Jinlu, etc., have gracefully arrived. The supporting actors they brought, such as Chu Jinpeng, Guan Dexian, Wang Yurang, etc., are all former classmates from the opera school. With so much talent, this is truly a grand gathering of the times.

Song Dezhu is a martial arts actress who also crosses over into the roles of young women and vivacious women. She can be said to be multi-talented. In all fairness, her performances are more impactful than Yan Shishan's, and she also has more plays. As for dramatic plays, her singing and acting are both up to par, and her appearance is also sufficiently beautiful. After returning north from Huangjin with a reputation, she has worked even harder to deepen her acting skills, and has also invited the famous playwright Mr. Weng Ouhong to write many short plays for her. With her proactive approach, her art has become even more exquisite. This time, she was invited to come south to Gengxin, revisiting old ground, and she will surely have plenty of room to maneuver.

The male actor Li Hezeng is a direct disciple of Gao Qingkui. Most of what he has learned is also in the style of Ziju's plays, such as "Crying at the Qin Court," "Xiaoyao Jin," "Rouge Plot," "Digging to See Mother," and "Lord Xinling." He has long enjoyed a great reputation in the Pingjin area. After Ziju passed away, Hezeng sought to broaden his repertoire and also worked diligently on the plays of the Tan school. Through diligent study, he has achieved a great deal. The other day, when Hezeng accompanied Dezhu to the Lishe Ticket Office to pay his respects, I begged him to sing a passage from "Searching for Orphans and Saving Orphans" in the original style. It was proper and generous, capturing the essence of the Shu Yan style. I then knew that Hezeng had been working hard on the Tan plays for quite some time. How could a hasty and impromptu performance achieve such a wonderful state?

### Trends in the Spoken Drama World

— Cheng Ren

After the Rongwei Company disbanded, the spoken drama actors under its banner split into CZC, Kuguan, and Huayi, forming a three-legged standoff. Recently, Kuguan has cooperated with CZC. It is said that starting from September 1st, they will be performing Xia Xia's "Widow's Home" at the Paris Grand Theater, with Xia Xia directing and starring in the play. They are actively rehearsing. It is also said that if the Golden Grand Theater closes for the summer, they will first perform "The Net of Heaven and Earth" at the Golden Theater as a transition.

The Huayi Company is currently recruiting outstanding actors, especially actresses. In addition to Lan Lan, there are also Dai Yun, Huang Zongying, Wang Qi, Jiang Tianliu, Wang Wei, Sally, Ke Gang, etc. Among the male actors, there are Huang Zongjiang, Hu Dao, Li Pu, Ying Yu, Feng Zhe, Yan Zhong, etc. The young male lead Han Fei has also signed a special contract. The troupe has now begun rehearsing new plays. The first shot has been decided to be Hu Tiwei's script, "The Human World," directed by Hong Mo. All the actors of the troupe will participate in the performance, which shows the strength of the lineup. At the same time, the Carlton is planning to hold a grand opening ceremony for the new company to show its importance. The ribbon-cutting ceremony will be performed by the troupe's famous actresses to show their importance. At the same time, the troupe's second shot has also been decided, which is Yao Ke's script, "The Mandarin Duck Sword." The story is tortuous and tells the story of the fallen people, which has the style of "Romeo and Juliet," which is very suitable for Chinese audiences. It is a great tragedy of love. In addition, there are famous plays such as "Woman," "White-Clothed Man," "Luoshen," "Blind Love," and "The Earth" in preparation, which will be staged one after another. During the hot summer, the audience will be refreshed by this new type of spoken drama.

Zhonglv abandoned Tiangong and entered the Queen; Sun Jinglu also seems to have a long-term performance trend in the Green Treasure. It is expected that in a month, the spoken drama world in Shanghai will present a flourishing scene again.

### "Red Treasure" Reorganized

— Gao Man

Li Qinian as the Cornerstone

The Sanyuan Company, which recently took over the Hongbao Theater on the second floor of the New World, is preparing to organize a brand-new troupe with great ambition, and is scheduled to perform at Hongbao around August 15th. Li Qinian has been hired as the leading actress, and she has personally selected two plays. As for Li Qinian's future stage male lead partner, it has been agreed that the newcomer Jin Ge will take the role. Jin Ge is a young college student who has put a lot of effort into studying stage plays. He is quite active in the Aurora Drama Club. Not long ago, Jin Ge was a core member of Mei Xi's Unnamed Drama Troupe. This time, he is cooperating with Li, and it is said that she recommended him herself. The rumor of Li Qinian and Bai Yun is hereby self-defeating!

### Recent News of Yan Shishan

— From Beiping, Su Zi

Beiping News: Martial arts actress Yan Shishan returned to Beiping with praise after performing at the Golden Theater last year. This spring, she was hired by the Dajin National Grand Theater and the China Grand Theater, and she and other artists such as Xiao Cuihua performed together for two weeks. Because of her excellent rapport with the audience and the owner's sincere retention, Yan and Xu Dongming and Xu Dongxia continued to perform, totaling about a month. She then returned to her hometown in the early summer. After a short rest, she plans to continue to work hard on her fancy-dress dramas. In the future, it can be predicted that she will be proficient in both civil and military arts. It is said that her teacher has already been hired.

### Pacific

— Zefu

Taiping Nian was originally a work song sung by mud workers when building walls and filling land, so it was formerly known as Hang Ge (Hang is read as Kang, meaning to lift objects with force). Later, it flowed into the singing and dancing arenas, and was composed into a tune. Because it always has the harmonies of "Taiping Nian" and "Nian Taiping" after each section, it is called Taiping Nian, also known as Taiping Ge. According to records, during the 55th year of Qianlong, when Gaozong celebrated his birthday, there was a song called "Eight Directions of Peace," which used this type of tune. When singing, six children would be dressed as celestial boys, each holding two gold plaques in their hands, one foot and three inches long, making an eight-diagram pattern according to the lyrics. The musical instruments included the pipa, xianzi, huqin, sheng, etc. It can be seen that this type of tune has a long history. However, the Taiping Nian sung in the northern Luoziguan is similar to those who sing kuaishu and danxian. One person sits and plays the xianzi, and the other person stands and sings, without any acting movements. When singing to a section, the person playing the xianzi harmonizes with the sentences "Taiping Nian" and "Nian Taiping," etc. The content is limited to stories, such as Wang Tianbao, Ding Lang Seeking Father, and Four Brothers Working, etc. Each section is usually four sentences, such as the first section of "Four Brothers Working": "In the first month, the first month is right, the four brothers went to work. First, they carried two loads of water (Taiping Nian), and after breakfast, they cleaned the cowshed (Nian Taiping)." In addition, there are also those that use "Ya Yo" as the harmony, which are very rare and can be said to be a variant of Taiping Nian.

Visiting Stage Artists

### Veteran Empress Dowager Jiang Hong

— Feng Ying

Jiang Hong is one of the famous spoken drama actors. In Xia Xia's self-written, directed, and starring "Widow's Home," she also plays a role. "Widow's Home" is the first shot of the CZC spoken drama group, and it will be performed soon.

Last semester, she was a student at Soochow University. This fall, she plans to transfer to Shanghai University. She is very lively, active, and likes the color purple the most. When I met her, she was wearing a purple skirt, a purple headscarf, and even the fan she was waving in her hand was purple. She speaks very politely, and more than half of her conversations are polite words.

"Are you studying politics?" "Yes, but I don't necessarily want to be a politician. Relatively speaking, in school, I like Chinese, English, and political science the most, but my grades are not good!"

"Are you a Christian?"

"No, but almost every Sunday morning, I go to Soochow Church for worship. One reason is that their sacred music group sings very well, and I can often hear beautiful music when I go to worship. The other reason is that the Dahua Cinema—Soochow Church—is not far from my home; and, I think that if I am free, I can often listen to the truth, which is also very helpful for 'being a person'."

She is from Suzhou, but she speaks fluent Mandarin. She likes to perform spoken dramas very much. The following is her self-report:

"When I was studying in middle school, I often participated in acting—in fact, it is very difficult for amateur drama clubs to hire good directors. Therefore, amateur actors usually serve as directors themselves. In this way, what good plays can be performed! At that time, I just went on and off the stage in a muddle-headed way, and I didn't understand anything at all. Now—although I still don't act well—I feel that I have been able to learn to figure out the personality of the characters in the play, and I already have a little bit of knowledge—although I am still far from the goal."

After performing "Qing Palace Grudge," the audience had a good impression of her and felt that her Empress Dowager Cixi was really good, so people called her "Veteran Empress Dowager." In fact, she can't just play the Empress Dowager. I heard that soon, in the play "Liang Shanbo and Zhu Yingtai," she will play the role of Liang Shanbo. It is still rare for women to play male roles in spoken dramas!

### Record of Dizziness

— A Re

According to reports, the weather this summer has been extremely hot, the hottest in six or seven years. Therefore, everyone is complaining about the heat. People suffering from brain weakness are even worse. They feel dizzy all day long, unable to think of a way to do things, and even feel nauseous, which greatly affects their health. Someone said that if you take "Brain and Kidney Ding," you will be safe and sound, because the drug functions to strengthen the brain, replenish the kidneys, produce essence, and improve appetite.

### Sharing the Same Boat in Storms

— He Jia Zhi

Weicheng said, "When it gets dark, Cheng Bing will probably show his true colors." Cuizhen also listened attentively from the side and said with a smile, "It's annoying when it gets dark. They are all men, and if my aunt is a woman, she will be scared by them a few words. Now, even my heart is beating." Mrs. Ye Er said, "You are all wrong. There is no such thing. When it gets dark, your mother wanted to go ashore, but Cheng Bing and another person were reluctant to let her go, forcing your mother to eat dinner. Your mother couldn't resist their kindness, so she only took a bite and put down the bowl. After dinner, Cheng Bing said, 'Now the boats in the river are probably looser, so I can send you back.' On the boat, one was still smoking opium, and the other was still smoking cigarettes. They really sent your mother back to Gangbei Village."

Weicheng said, "So, Cheng Bing is not a bad person. It's a pity that he was bad later. There is no doubt that he was bad." Mrs. Ye Er said, "At that time, your grandmother was still alive. When your mother arrived home, the boat that your uncle took had not arrived home. That Cheng Bing sent your mother ashore and left without even sitting down. So, if there was no later incident, Cheng Bing would simply be a saint. But things are and are not. A month later, Cheng Bing wrote a letter, in which he still said that meeting each other by chance was not accidental, etc. Your mother read it to your grandmother and showed it to your uncle. Your uncle wrote a reply thanking him. The place he lived was a very unfamiliar name, called Ant Town, which was dozens of miles away from here. Later, Cheng Bing sent a photo to your mother. Your mother thought that this was a bit out of place, so she didn't tell her mother and brother, but only hid the photo. During this period, your father, with your father's approval, was discussing marriage with a family in the village that was well-matched. According to the fortune teller, Miss Li was the best among many ladies. In less than ten days, the marriage was decided. But Cheng Bing didn't know." (143)
