According to military sources here, Red Army infantry in the Voronezh area recently launched another attack on German forces with the aid of tanks, resulting in fierce hand-to-hand combat. The enemy briefly breached German lines at one point, but German infantry immediately filled the gap and annihilated the enemy. Southeast of Orel, enemy forces launched a heavy attack but were repelled. In the Zizdra area, enemy forces launched several local attacks. North of Erchifu, two German divisions have repelled 300 Red Army offensives over the past few weeks. The Red Army has lost 400 tanks.

According to the latest news from Moscow, fierce fighting continues in the ruins of Stalingrad. Hundreds of tanks lie buried in the rubble. German bombs rain down, turning the city into a hell. The fighting is particularly fierce in the northwestern part of Stalingrad, where virtually nothing remains intact. German pressure is increasing by the hour. Large fires and dense smoke are everywhere. Allied reinforcements have arrived to assist in the battle. German transport planes have also arrived with reinforcements. Soviet forces continue to attack at Voronezh in an attempt to relieve the siege of Stalingrad.

Stockholm, Sweden, November 20th, Havas News Agency

According to the Soviet Red Army newspaper Red Star, street fighting continues in the suburbs of Stalingrad, with the most intense fighting taking place in the northwestern suburbs. The two armies are only about 30 yards apart. Each offensive involves stabbing and hand-to-hand combat. One street changed hands four times in 48 hours. In some areas, German forces are still able to use tanks, allowing for swift movement and making defense difficult. In the overall battle for Stalingrad, German forces have a numerical advantage, with more machine guns and supplies delivered by air. The German air force still has the upper hand. However, the Soviet side has recently received a large supply of bombs and shells and is attacking enemy lines of communication west of the city with army units.

Domei News Agency

Lieutenant Colonel Yokoyama, the Japanese Army Press Chief in Shanghai, solemnly stated today that the mission of the three special Japanese envoys visiting Nanjing is not merely a matter of diplomatic courtesy. Their main purpose is to exchange views between the leaders of China and Japan to promote cooperation between the two countries in order to establish a new order in East Asia. Hiranuma, Arita, and Nagai are all influential leaders in Japanese political circles. Hiranuma and Arita served as Prime Minister and Foreign Minister, respectively, when Mr. Wang Jingwei launched the peace and nation-building movement. Nagai served as the Director-General of the East Asia Department of the Taisei Yokusankai. All were able to influence Japan. The previous visits by Hirota to Thailand, Prince Takamatsu to Manchukuo, and this visit are all expressions of Japan's friendship with the three countries. Just as the previous visits by the delegations strengthened the ties between Japan and Thailand and Manchukuo, this visit will further strengthen the ties between China and Japan. He concluded by saying that Japan's friendly policy towards China has not changed since the China Incident. At the time of the incident, Japanese diplomacy formulated three principles based on justice, so that Japan, Manchukuo, and China would be the axis of world peace in the new East Asian order. These three principles are friendship, anti-communism, and economic cooperation.

### Colonel Hiraiide Delivers Speech to Japanese Citizens

Tokyo, November 21st, Domei News Agency

Colonel Hiraiide, a spokesman for the Imperial Japanese Navy Press Department, gave a speech to 30,000 Japanese citizens on Friday evening, stating that the last time 10,000 US Navy personnel landed on the Solomon Islands, they were all wiped out. Strategically speaking, it is easy to annihilate the US military because their long-distance expeditionary reinforcements are difficult. This move should be seen as Roosevelt's political gesture, with the Navy as his sacrifice. Furthermore, former US Ambassador to Japan Grew underestimated Japan's latent power, saying that Japan was exhausted from the China Incident and that the US could put any pressure on Japan without Japan becoming indignant. This report was entirely based on Roosevelt's policy towards Japan. Now, Americans are gradually doubting the battle reports issued by their own country and are turning to believe the news released by the Imperial Japanese Headquarters.

The English-language Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury reported that French Consul General Magre had notified residents of the French Concession yesterday morning that all equipment for the blackout must be prepared as completely as possible in the short term, as the air defense drill will be held from October 1st to 10th. Magre stated in his announcement that although the operation of general stores continued after the lights were covered in the previous air defense drill in the French Concession, some residents inevitably slackened off their work due to the blackout. The start and end of the drill will be broadcast on the XQHA radio station (900 kHz frequency) as stipulated by the Air Defense Supreme Command. As for the Shanghai Municipal Council, it also issued a similar notice yesterday morning. During this ten-day exercise, the French Concession Fire Brigade will be dispatched at any time to practice. Every residence has been notified to store water in preparation for assistance when necessary. When the alarm sounds, the first team will immediately depart to the police station to await orders for rescue. Doctors will also go to their designated hospitals or health centers to provide rescue. Public lighting will be controlled in accordance with special notices, and private lighting must be covered by citizens with black cloth.

### Polish Emigrants to Register by Deadline

About 1,000 Polish Emigrants Plan to Retreat, English-language Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury reported that the United Polish Emigrants Association of China issued a notice the day before yesterday that all Polish emigrants in the city should register by Wednesday.

Tom Swan believes that this measure will also be useful for the possible evacuation of Polish emigrants in the future. According to previous reports, about 1,000 Polish emigrants in Shanghai plan to evacuate.

### Expand the Scope of Evacuation of Coffins in the City

Spreading to various places in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, the Guo Hua Coffin Transport Department negotiates.

Since the incident, more and more coffins have accumulated in the city. Funeral homes, public offices, funeral parlors, and material coffin houses are full, making it impossible to evacuate them for a while, which is a major obstacle to hygiene. The relevant authorities in the city attach great importance to the Guo Hua Funeral Home, which was ordered to establish a Coffin Transport Department to handle the evacuation of coffins. The trial evacuation of coffins in various places in eastern Zhejiang has been underway for several months and has achieved remarkable results. Therefore, recently, various hometown associations, public offices, and material coffin houses have suggested to the department to expand the scope of evacuation. Because the evacuation work in eastern Zhejiang has become increasingly busy recently, the department has been unable to carry out the expansion for a while, but all parties are urging it very urgently. The department will first start the evacuation of coffins from Kunshan, Suzhou, Wuxi, Changzhou, Zhenjiang, Nanjing, Jiaxing, Hangzhou, Yangzhou and other places. Needy coffin relatives can still apply for free or reduced-fee transport. Contact can be made at No. 2, Lane 96, Jing'an Temple Road (i.e., the east end of the Jinmen Hotel).

### Armbands Required: List of Nationals from 34 Countries

### Reasons for Delay in Repatriation of Nationals from the Americas

No Repatriation Ships from the Americas

The repatriation of nationals from the Americas remains unresolved. Although the governments concerned have reached agreement in principle on various issues, the practical difficulties are proving difficult to overcome. The Japanese Consulate General, the Swiss Consulate, and the Nationals Association in Shanghai have not released any information on this matter in the past week or two. While the Conte Verde has arrived in Shanghai from Japan, the Italian shipping company has refused to confirm whether the ship will continue to be chartered to repatriate nationals from the Far East to the Americas. As a result, there has been no official confirmation that the repatriation of Americans will take place next month. However, according to well-informed sources, the main reason for the indefinite delay in the exchange of nationals between the Americas and Japan is the scheduling of ships. Based on current indications, Japanese nationals in the Americas will not be able to obtain suitable ships from the authorities to transport them to the Americas in the short term. Therefore, regardless of whether the Japanese authorities have ships available in the Far East, the departure of Americans will inevitably be postponed. As a general rule, ships repatriating nationals from the Far East must depart one week after the ships repatriating nationals from the Americas have set sail, because the voyage from Yokohama or Shanghai to East Africa via the Suez Canal is longer. In fact, the continued requisition of the NYK liner Kamakura Maru and the possibility of the Conte Verde continuing to be chartered are both subject to negotiation, so the repatriation of nationals has had to be significantly delayed. To date, American nationals in Shanghai have not received official notification of their repatriation.

The offices issuing rice coupons in the Public Concession have been issuing the 13th to 16th period rice coupons and will complete this on the 23rd (Wednesday). However, for the sake of convenience, applications for supplementary issuance will still be accepted on the two Sundays following the 23rd. Therefore, the rice coupon issuing offices will handle supplementary issuance of rice coupons during these two weeks.

Commercial News

### Government Bond Market Conditions

Yesterday, there was still considerable activity in the over-the-counter trading of government bonds, but the black market trading was inevitably chaotic and inconsistent. Market conditions generally rose first and then fell, probably because many parties slightly emerged to take profits as prices had risen too sharply. Furthermore, it was difficult to find counterparties for over-the-counter transactions and the sharp increase prior to holding considerable capital positions was similar to today's sudden drop. It is expected that the market will formally convene and reorganize after the Mid-Autumn Festival. Yesterday, the price of Category C bonds rose as high as 6.90 yuan, but then fell to as low as 4.70 yuan due to profit-taking by the bulls, before recovering to around 5 yuan. Category B bonds fell the most, by 1.5 yuan, with a final price of 2.5 yuan. Other categories also experienced small declines of a few jiao to one yuan. The volume of transactions was not large and is therefore omitted. There were many changes in the market with fierce competition, so let's wait and see what happens.

### Chinese Merchants Must Report Movement of Goods to Guilds First

Regarding the subsequent movement of goods by Chinese merchants and applications for certificates of entry and exit, it has been stipulated that each company, factory, or firm should first report to its respective industry guild, which will then certify it to the Chamber of Commerce, which will then issue the certificate. The industry guilds will only accept applications from their members. Loans secured by goods from silver and money shops are limited to member firms of the industry guild. At the same time, the Regulations on Temporarily Stabilizing Commodity Prices stipulate that non-guild members may not engage in the purchase and sale of various commodities in any way or through any channel. Therefore, all companies, factories, and firms in each industry should join their respective industry guilds to facilitate business.

### Activity in Chinese Stocks Remains Strong

Yesterday, the market for Chinese stocks was remarkably strong. Although investors were affected by tight money, they made every effort to remain active, driven by various favorable rumors. The opening price of the new stock of Standard Paper Products rose from 12 yuan to 14 yuan, further stimulating prosperity. The new pharmaceutical company, Sino-French Pharmacy, rose the most sharply, reaching 83 yuan, a gain of 4 yuan. New Asia rose 7.5 jiao to 46.75 yuan. Sino-Western (410 yuan) and Shin Yih (940 yuan) and Wuzhou (290 yuan) were all in demand, only rising and not falling, with the highest price being the final transaction price.

The retail price of ornamental silver was still quoted at 14 yuan per tael, and the inter-dealer price rose to 12 yuan 7.8 jiao.

### Grain and Bean Arrivals and Sales Were Still Flat

Beans Yesterday, there were sporadic arrivals. Shops on this street all selectively took what they needed, so the market was still flat. The reported prices were: 30 packages of Wujiang Selected Green beans at 209 yuan, 20 packages of Chongming Sand Red beans at 163 yuan, and 50 packages of Tianjin Red Beans at 160 to 158 yuan.

Sorghum Arrivals and sales were similar, and the market was firm and stable. Yesterday, over 200 packages of Mingguang Sorghum, new crop, were priced at 114 yuan, and old crop at 91 yuan.

### Sugar Shares Eased, Transactions Became Scarce

The trend of sugar shares at the Sugar Merchants Cooperative Business Office was slightly flat, and transactions became scarce. The association quoted crude sugar shares (without dividends) at 307 yuan, and with dividends at 303 yuan, a slight decrease of 5 jiao. Raw sugar shares (with dividends) were 300 yuan. In total, there were just over 1,000 transactions.

### Cigarettes Continued to Prosper

Cigarettes continued to rise due to the rumor of profit-taking which had not diminished the people's expectations. The market continued to rise.

The first batch of Jinan Dried Peaches has arrived in a few pieces. As the first time to see new products, they are extremely tight. The market's competitive entry quotation has reached a new high price of 800 yuan. However, it is heard that the selling disk is small, and the search still needs to be accompanied by posting, which is also a common phenomenon in the initial tasting. The after-market should gradually become formal.

The first batch of dozens of pieces of Jiyang Black Dates has arrived, and the products are very good. Immediately offered, the top grade is 500 yuan, and the second grade is 460 yuan. Each firm has a few pieces, all for the purpose of trying new things. Because of this, the old goods are also rising.

### Fun Quiz: Among the Four Great Beauties (Jade) of China Union, Whose Teeth Are the Most Beautiful?

Gu Lanjun, Chen Yunshang, Chen Yanyan, and Yuan Meiyun are known as the Four Great Beauties of China Union. Now, we are not talking about anything else here, but specifically asking which of the Four Great Beauties is the most beautiful, which should be ranked first, which should be ranked second, which should be ranked third, and which should be ranked fourth. Movie fans must pay special attention to the smiles and frowns of the stars, so this question is publicly soliciting answers from readers. At the same time, in order to increase interest, the Shanghai Clean Teeth Institute will give a 10-yuan cleaning voucher to readers who answer correctly, entitling them to a free cleaning, but this is limited to ten vouchers. If more than ten people answer correctly, the winners will be determined by lottery. Those who do not win will also receive exquisite publications. Please send your letters to the Advertising Department, Shanghai Clean Teeth Institute, Jinshan Hotel Storefront, Guangxi Road, Shanghai (the answers will be published in this column in the next issue).

### You Can't Help But Believe It

An Unclean Tooth Can Sacrifice Your Life An American saying: "An unclean tooth can sacrifice your life." The deaths of Zhao Songmou of Wujin and Mrs. Kujo Takeko (Ki) of Japan, among others, who died of dental diseases, are proof of this, which makes it even more believable. It can be seen that oral hygiene is indeed of great importance to physical health. However, attention to oral hygiene must be practiced through scientific teeth cleaning in order to eliminate germs and prevent dental problems.

Chinese People Suffering from Dental Diseases Account for 87 Percent According to specialist dentists, 87 percent of Chinese men over the age of thirty suffer from dental diseases. Among them, 18 percent have four diseased teeth, 26 percent have three diseased teeth, 29 percent have two diseased teeth, 16 percent have one diseased tooth, and 8 percent have five to eight diseased teeth. Only 13 percent have completely healthy teeth.

There are Clean Teeth Institutes Everywhere in Southeast Asia According to Southeast Asian returnees, there are Clean Teeth Institutes everywhere in Southeast Asia. In Singapore alone, there are already as many as six Clean Teeth Institutes (called "teeth washing institutes" locally), and each one is bustling with customers and business is extremely prosperous. The attention paid by the locals to dental hygiene can be seen from this.

Scientific Teeth Cleaning Has Become a Fashionable Trend After Shanghai Clean Teeth Institute Expanded Its Promotion on Jinshan Hotel Storefront, Guangxi Road, it has aroused a general awareness of "scientific teeth cleaning." In recent days, the ladies who go to the clinic for teeth cleaning are in an endless stream. It can be seen that scientific teeth cleaning has become a fashionable trend in Shanghai.

### Zhou Manhua Cuts Ribbon at Opening of Shanghai Clean Teeth Institute

On the opening day of the Shanghai Clean Teeth Institute, the movie star Miss Zhou Manhua was specially invited to hold the ribbon-cutting ceremony. When the movie fans heard the news, they rushed to the clinic to see the star's beauty, causing a sea of people on Guangxi Road and disrupting order for a time. (Juting)

### Correcting Misconceptions

Scientific Teeth Cleaning Absolutely Does Not Damage Enamel

Some people think that scientific teeth cleaning is washing teeth with chemicals and that it may damage the enamel of the tooth surface. In fact, this view is completely wrong. You must know that scientific teeth cleaning and chemical teeth washing methods are completely different. Strong chemicals do damage the tooth surface, but scientific teeth cleaning absolutely does not use chemicals. It is based entirely on special medical and scientific methods, such as using various different teeth cleaning instruments and electric brushes to scrape off tartar and calculus. This method does not damage the enamel of the tooth surface at all. Therefore, we should have a clear distinction and special understanding of scientific teeth cleaning and chemical teeth washing. (Dentist Ding Xian De)

### Scientific Teeth Cleaning Receives High Praise from Various Newspapers

After the Shanghai Clean Teeth Institute expanded its promotion, the matter of scientific teeth cleaning has not only aroused close attention from all walks of life, but has also won unanimous praise from major and minor newspapers. For example, the "News Report Teahouse" once published an article on the importance of teeth cleaning, praising scientific teeth preparation. The "Shen Bao" on the 11th published a Shanghai Clean Teeth Institute interview note, believing that the content of the clinic had a very good impression. Other newspapers such as the "Shanghai Daily" also gave high praise. (Yu)

### This Column Will Open a Hygiene Mailbox

Answered by Miss Li Hao

Miss Li Hao's hygiene mailbox is very popular. Now the Shanghai Clean Teeth Institute also intends to set up a mailbox, named "Dental Hygiene," to be answered by Miss Li Hao, a female dentist at the clinic. Miss Li is a top student of dentist Huang Bingyu, with profound knowledge and rich experience. She is especially proficient in literature and will answer questions about dental problems from all walks of life in the future with a relaxed and fluent style of writing. (Shui)

### Starting with Oneself

— Zhi Hu

The day after tomorrow is the Mid-Autumn Festival. The Mid-Autumn Festival is a joyous occasion. It is said that city dwellers have a particularly keen sense of the seasons. In reality, this is due to the different environments each person is in. For example, the early launch of mooncakes is not due to merchants' special affection for the August moon. The key to success in commercial warfare lies in innovation and changing with the times. In other words, seizing the lead is victory. Looking around, the so-called market in recent years is within their grasp.

The wealthy plan how to use any excuse to enjoy themselves when a festival approaches. Conversely, the opposite is naturally to use some kind of excuse to escape this difficult situation. Every festival, we also see articles that advise people to save and avoid extravagance, achieving two goals at once. But the advisors advise themselves, and the listeners do not hear. Saving and avoiding extravagance are not limited to festivals. Moreover, the advisors' incessant nagging makes people turn a deaf ear. Just as thinking of relatives is inevitable during festivals, it is also similar to selling mooncakes in autumn. It is almost philistine. Saving can be done at any time, and thinking of relatives can be done every day. Instead of advising others, start with yourself.

### On Treating the Root Cause of Illness

— Xiao Ying

When sick, one must seek treatment. Treatment must be swift for a quick recovery and to restore one's original health. Otherwise, one will face extinction and death.

However, treatment must also be appropriate. To simply cut out the rotten flesh without injecting serum for a festering wound is not enough. The surface may appear temporarily better, but the toxins will still reactivate and cause recurrence in the future.

In short, a good doctor will first investigate the cause of the illness and then treat the root. If one simply treats the head when it hurts and the foot when it hurts, then one is a mediocre doctor.

Last year's unfortunate incident where a tram conductor pushed a passenger to his death seems to have been resolved, and the culprit was punished. However, if the company authorities actively distributed the conductor's tedious workload (by adding ticket sellers at the doors, etc.) and seriously considered improving the workers' compensation (to ensure their peace of mind and loyal service), then how could the unfortunate incident of the eighth of this month (see this newspaper's fifteenth-day news), where conductor Xia Qiaosheng insulted and even pushed passenger Zhu Yaoliang, causing his right foot to be crushed by the train wheels, recur this year?

### When Will Daddy Come Home?

— Tang Ning

Mr. Li left early in the morning. It is said that he left in a fit of pique, so Mrs. Li looks very upset.

The eleven-year-old child put on his blue cloth gown, ready to pay the tuition fees, because school starts today.

We can't even afford food, so what's the point of studying? Mrs. Li, irritated by the child's pestering, slapped him. The child shrank to the corner of the bed and cried, soaking a large patch of the gown with tears.

Like Aji next door, who can sell two baskets of stir-fried beans every day and earn four or five dollars, you're as old as him and have studied for three years. What good is it? The more Mrs. Li spoke, the angrier she became, as if she wanted to throw the two-year-old daughter she was holding while breastfeeding out the window.

Mrs. Li is already anxious enough. Her seven-year-old child is sick and has not seen a doctor. Today is Saturday, and there are still four and a half liters of household rice to be collected. The couple argued last night, and this morning he left in a fit of pique. I don't know if he will come back tonight.

The early autumn sun has climbed from the large ears of the fire wall onto the bed. Outside the door, peddlers' cries can be heard.

"Broken cloth for red sand beans." The voice floated in the wind. Mrs. Li's heart stirred. "What are you crying about, son? Take some scraps of cloth to exchange for beans."

The beans were exchanged, and the child peeled and ate them. Mrs. Li put down her daughter and peeled and ate them too.

"Mom, what are you eating?" The seven-year-old sick child also woke up and stretched his neck. "You can't eat this. I'll give you meat floss porridge when Dad comes home."

"Dad... when will he come?"

There was no answer. Mrs. Li just tilted her head, and tears flowed like beads from a broken string.

### Reunion

— Yi Li

Some people praise Qin Shouou's "Autumn Begonia" as the most powerful, vivid, and dramatic section of the book is the reunion of Luo Xiangqi and her daughter, Mei Bao. I recently saw this book as well, and this strange and tortuous story indeed moved me to tears.

Life is inherently a tragedy, and the elements of joy are simply too few. For example, the separation and reunion of two of the closest people should be a very happy thing. However, the environment at the time of reunion is often so awkward and so unbearable to recall. Even when mother and child cannot recognize each other, or when they have a bellyful of longing but no way to utter a word, what heart-wrenching pain is this?

When I was six years old, I said goodbye to my beloved second sister. A full twenty-one years passed without seeing each other. After the war, I finally met her husband in Hong Kong and learned that she was in the hospital giving birth. The next morning, I rushed there, but she was breathing her last breath due to complications in childbirth. That day, I almost fainted in front of her sickbed.

Life is full of worries. Even a scene of reunion of flesh and blood is often not necessarily joyful.

### Sharing the Same Boat in Storms

— He Jia Zhi

(9) Human Hell

Taking advantage of Wei Yunqing's loosening grip, Mrs. Wei twisted her body and walked outside. Wei Yunqing was not about to let her go easily, so he reached out and grabbed her hair, which was as brittle as a coal ball, and said, "Where are you going? You make the house a joke, as if there's no master, with everyone doing their own thing. Having a mother like you has led to a rebellious son like Shaoyun." Mrs. Wei didn't have much hair to begin with, and couldn't withstand Wei Yunqing's grip. She took a step back, feeling a pain that went to the bone, and shouted, "Help!" Then she fell backward. Wei Yunqing didn't show any pity and let her fall. With a thud, she fell to the ground. He snatched a rattan whip from the wall like a mad dog and whipped Cao Ma's thick cotton trousers, which were as thick as a quilt. Then he rushed over and whipped A Si's back, which was bent like a bow, and shouted, "Where is it? Where is it? You say it or you're dead. Even if I beat you to death to pay for it, you'll still die before me." As he said this, he whipped A Si's back again with the first and third whips.

The room was obviously chaotic. Wei Yunqing suddenly seemed ten years younger and jumped around, shouting in the courtyard, "Rebellion! Rebellion!" More than a dozen people, tall and short, stood in the courtyard, all of whom had eaten their share of bitterness and were working like beasts of burden for Wei Yunqing. When Wei Yunqing came out, they hurriedly retreated a few steps and shrank to the side. Wei Yunqing called out, "A Si, come here." A Si walked out. Wei Yunqing grabbed his hand and turned everyone, from top to bottom, inside and outside, in Wei Yuanwai's house upside down to search. But they couldn't find Bian Cuizhen and Wei Shaoyun. Wei Yunqing went to the small courtyard in the west, where Cuizhen had been confined before. Seeing that there was no one else around, he changed his expression and said, "A Si, you know where the young master is. Tell me. If you tell me, how much reward do you want? I'll agree to it immediately. If you want a hundred, it's a hundred. If you want two hundred, it's two hundred. It won't be like before, where I didn't keep my word. If you want to marry a wife, I'll find a way to borrow money for you, and the interest will be as low as it can be. I hit you just now out of anger. Now that I think about it, you're actually a good person." A Si was surprised to see Wei Yunqing softening towards someone like him for the first time, and felt flattered. He first scratched his head, then smiled and said, "Master, I really don't know where the young master is." Wei Yunqing said, "No one knows his son better than his father. I know that rebellious son's temper. I should find Miss Bian soon, and I can't delay any longer. Even if I find her, it's no use. A Si, watch me, Master, kneel down to you." Wei Yunqing was simply a great man who could bend and stretch, and knelt down on both knees. (183)
