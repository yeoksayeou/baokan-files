### End of Malayan Campaign: British Forces Retreat to Singapore Island, Johor Strait Causeway Destroyed; Battle for Singapore to Commence

Tokyo, January 31st, Domei News Agency: The battle for the Malay Peninsula is nearing its final stage. Japanese forces have breached British defenses, captured Kulai, and this morning advanced to a point ten miles south of Skudai, north of Johor Bahru. Japanese forces on the west coast are also continuing their southward advance, capturing Pontian Kechil. Japanese aerial reconnaissance reports no enemy presence in the vicinity of Pontian Kechil and the Kulai area, save for a small number of Indian troops guarding the main water pipeline. Although the vanguard of the Japanese army has passed through Skudai, it is reported that fighting between that location and Kulai remains fierce, centered around Senai, approximately fifteen miles north of Johor Bahru. Reports from the front this evening indicate that the Japanese vanguard advancing on Johor Bahru appears to be progressing along the road parallel to the railway (leading to Johor Bahru). Simultaneously, Japanese aircraft continue to bomb Singapore, inflicting damage.

Singapore, January 31st, Havas: Local officials announced today that our forces in southern Johor had completely retreated to Singapore Island last night, according to a prearranged plan. As our troops withdrew, Japanese forces attempted to intercept them, but the causeway connecting Singapore and Johor was destroyed by our forces.

London, January 30th, Havas: The British Broadcasting Corporation announced that Japanese forces in the central part of the Malay Peninsula have made a rapid advance, reaching a point eighteen miles from the Johor Causeway (i.e., the causeway connecting Johor and Singapore Island). The causeway has an important highway and railway line, as well as a water pipeline that brings drinking water from Johor reservoirs to Singapore Island. However, Singapore also has numerous reservoirs, which should be sufficient. In addition, Japanese forces in the central region are reportedly quite strong, aided by the full support of bomber squadrons.

Saigon, January 31st, Huitong News Agency: An official statement from Singapore stated that British forces have retreated from southern Johor to Singapore Island. The Malayan war has come to an end, and the war for Singapore is now beginning.

Singapore, January 31st, Reuters: The British Far East Command issued a communiqué here today, stating that British forces fighting in southern Johor retreated to Singapore Island last night according to plan. Japanese forces did not strongly impede the British retreat. The causeway connecting the new island and the mainland was destroyed. British naval and air forces are cooperating in operations. The communiqué quoted an official of the Malayan British Army Headquarters as saying, "The Malayan campaign has ended, and the Singapore campaign has begun. Our forces have been fighting the Japanese army on the mainland for two months. The Japanese army possesses air superiority and great freedom of movement at sea. Our mission was to inflict losses on the Japanese army and buy time for the Allied forces to concentrate for this Far Eastern struggle. Today, we are besieged in the fortress of the new island. Our mission is to defend this fortress and await the arrival of reinforcements. We are determined to do this. We need the active assistance of every man and woman in this fortress to carry out this task, and there must be no more wild talk or rumor-mongering. Our task is clear." This morning, there was again much aerial activity over Singapore, but there have been no reports of bombs dropped or injuries. According to responsible sources in London, it is now known that British forces have completely retreated from Malaya to the new island. The causeway connecting the mainland and the new island is three-quarters of a mile long and made of cement and stone, making it difficult to completely destroy. The causeway is approximately sixty feet wide, with a highway and railway passing over it, and small openings underneath for small boats to pass through. The Johor Strait between the mainland and the new island is six to eight fathoms deep (each fathom is six feet). Singapore means "Lion City" and is known as the "door of the Far East." It has been a British colony for over a century. In 1824, Sir Stamford Raffles persuaded the British government to purchase it for £13,500. Today it is the fifth largest port in the British Empire. The major naval base on the north coast of the new island took twelve years and cost £30 million to build and can accommodate the largest warships in the British Navy. The population of the new island is normally about 750,000.

London, January 31st, Reuters: A communiqué issued in Batavia today stated that Japanese forces have attacked Ambon Island, between Celebes and Dutch New Guinea.

The population of Ambon is approximately 270,000. Australian Aviation Minister Arthur Drakeford recently stated in Melbourne that he expects Japanese forces to land on Ambon today.

Therefore, the battles at Kendari in the Celebes Islands and Tarakan on the east coast of Borneo are now secondary.

Tokyo, January 31st, Domei News Agency: General Headquarters issued a communiqué this afternoon stating that elite units of the Japanese army landed near Bangka on the west coast of Dutch Borneo before dawn on January 27th and occupied Sampit, a key area in the region, at 3:00 PM on the same day.

Even in this time of war, our nation has not abandoned the original ideals of Christian civilization, but must continue to practice them. These ideals have nothing in common with torpedoes, cannons, and bombs. This is why we have absolute faith in the future. Donations from the balls and other celebrations held to celebrate my birthday will be used to support hospitals for crippled infants, but this year they will be reserved for the orphans of soldiers who died in the army, navy, and air force who are sick."

However, upon reflection, I felt both fear and joy, as most of the world is still governed by faith, hope, and charity, and each of our lives is now dedicated to work and combat."

### Germany to Launch Submarine Offensive in All Oceans; Hitler Delivers Speech in Berlin on Ninth Anniversary of Founding of the National Socialist Party

Berlin, January 30th, German News Agency: Today is the ninth anniversary of the founding of the National Socialist Party. The Führer Hitler delivered a speech at the Berlin Sports Arena, the main points of which are as follows: This year will be another year of German victory. I do not know if the war will end this year, but one thing I know for sure is that we will defeat the enemy wherever we meet them. Winter will soon pass, and the German army will advance again. The German army is temporarily taking a defensive posture because the temperature is 30 to 35 degrees below freezing, not because of the strength of the Soviet army. The number of German submarines has greatly increased, and the enemy will soon suffer a serious blow from German submarines in all oceans. German forces under Rommel are advancing again and have shattered British hopes for a final victory in the North African campaign. This shows that German forces will fight bravely wherever they are, and even if it is necessary to retreat temporarily, they will come back and not stop until they achieve victory. Germany and Italy have been united for several years under a common goal and are now fighting to achieve this goal and will not stop fighting until victory is achieved. We are very grateful to Japan because Japan's strength is sufficient to guarantee the defeat of the enemy. Japan is launching a fatal blow to the enemy in the Pacific region, and the enemy is caught off guard and unable to resist.

### Yarn Market Gloomy - There is a Reason

The cotton yarn market is still in a state of stagnation. While the 同和里 [Tongheli] Yarn Industry Association is busy registering, the market's front and back doors are difficult to open. It will only be possible to officially operate and publish accurate quotes after the authorities announce effective measures to the market after registration. At the same time, with continuous rain and the approaching end of the accounting period, most people have no intention of doing business. As for general handlers, given that the price of factory orders is already low, with only one-third of the peak price remaining, most are unwilling to force a sale, except for floating accounts forced to close due to financial constraints. Therefore, the market has become stagnant. According to some brokers, the spot price of guaranteed goods has risen uniformly, but the supply of goods on the market is pitifully small. As a result, the market is relatively firm. 20-count Shuangma factory orders are being sought at 1320-1330 yuan. 32-count single yarn is quoted even higher. 20-count Yueqin spot price is 2300 yuan. 20-count Shuangma guaranteed spot is 2100 yuan. 42-count Lanfeng spot price is 4100 yuan.

### Cotton Cloth Market Dull

Yesterday's factory cloth market was dull, with slight variations in selling prices. Due to the willingness of colleagues to loosen their hands on goods, 16-pound coarse cloth was traded for 119 yuan for Huadie, 115 yuan for Shuangxiang, and 102.5 yuan for Shuanglong coarse cloth. 12-pound Dapeng fine cloth was handled by the Yongbang帮 [gang] group, so it rebounded again, with selling prices starting at 95 yuan.

Dong cloth fine cloth continued to rise. 12-pound Longtou spot price rose to 90 yuan per bolt, factory orders at 86.75 yuan, an increase of 5 jiao. Caiqiu fine cloth spot price traded at 88.5 yuan, warehouse receipts at 84.75 yuan. Yanghe Laba also required 88 yuan, and the number of bolts was not large. Sijunzi Serge spot price was 3.04 yuan, a small decrease of 1 fen. Warehouse receipts were 2.83-4 yuan.

### Resolution of Government Bond Coupon Issue - Continued Progress in Foreign Stocks

The government bond grey market was quite stable yesterday. The coupon issue, which has been in dispute for several days, has now been temporarily resolved, meaning that the seller is willing to deliver with the 12th coupon. However, since the announcement that the drawing of lots for interest payment would be held in Chongqing, Shanghai has not received notification of the 12th winning number for Category E bonds, nearly two months later. This is also a matter that Shanghai bondholders are eager to clarify. As for the market price outlook, it is not considered to be too small for the time being. It is heard that Tongyihao is willing to buy the 12th coupon at a 70% discount, which is another good sign that government bonds are valued. Yesterday's market prices were mostly slightly better by 0.2-0.3 yuan. There were no trades in Category D bonds, while Category E bonds were slightly lower by 0.1 yuan. Closing prices were 70.02 yuan for Category A, 67.8 yuan for Category B, 66.55 yuan for Category C, and 64 yuan for Category E. The trading volume was about 500,000 yuan.

Foreign stocks progressed and trading volume increased significantly. A total of 12,200 shares of industrial and public utility stocks were traded. Yeguang was 14.5-6-7 yuan, Yangtze was 10.8 yuan, Shanghai Bank was 12.3 yuan, Jardine Brewery was 5.5 yuan, Wheelock was 52 yuan, Jardine Spinning Mill was 25.75 yuan, Xinli was 6.2 yuan, Tramways was 33-34 yuan, Paper Industry was 5.8-6 yuan, Steel Industry was 15.4-5 yuan, Ken Zhi was 19.5-20.075 yuan, Kaiping was 27 yuan, Rubber was about 12 yuan, Langezhi was 14.6 yuan, Ying Zhahua was 11 yuan, Keluo Hua was 1.8 yuan, Galundan was 0.85 yuan, Zhongying was 7 yuan, Navigation was 8 yuan, Zilaihuo was 8.4 yuan, Rubber was 13 yuan, Chenshi was 0.5 yuan, Lishi was 0.6 yuan, all with advances. The purchase price of China Textiles was 8.4 yuan and the sale price was 9 yuan. Public buses were 9.6 yuan and Electricity Preference was 78 yuan, all with buyers.

### Cash Firm with Steadiness

The cash black market was firm with steadiness. Prices remained between 10,800 and 10,900 yuan. Gold dealers are still pushing up the price. The opening price was 10,780 yuan, 30 yuan lower. Then it rose 60 yuan to 10,840 yuan. It was heard that 2 pieces of 50 yuan were traded. Later, it fell slightly to 10,800 yuan.

### Japonica Rice Has Ups and Downs

At the highest price, Baodao was once quoted at 198.5-198 yuan, Zaodao at 197.5-197 yuan, and Kunshan Gaojing was also quoted at 232 yuan. Later, due to the high price, buyers were unwilling to advance further, and cargo owners had to lower their prices to sell. As a result, Baodao fell back to 196 yuan from 197 yuan, Zaodao also fell to 196 yuan, and Kunshan Baijing also gradually fell. Gaojing eventually only reached 230-228 yuan, Zhongguan was 225 yuan, and Changxi Chencijing was 200 yuan, a comparison showed a decrease of 1-2 yuan. Such as Jintan Baiyuan, the supply and demand was similar, and there was no profit or loss, the quoted price was still 207 yuan.

### Miscellaneous Grain Trading Stagnant

There was still no trading of cooking oil. Jiangbei raw oil was quoted at 430-440 yuan, with no transactions.

In addition, 250 bags of Chenjinyuan were sold, priced at 129.5 yuan, and 200 bags of Jiangbei Qingdou were sold, priced at 124.5 yuan.

The sales of red beans on this street continued to rise, and the market continued to trend upwards. Yesterday, 180 bags of Pinghu red beans were sold, priced at 92 yuan, and 30 bags of Chongming sand red were sold, priced at 90-91 yuan. The source of mung beans was lacking, and cargo owners were very willing to sell. Yesterday, Tianjin mung beans were quoted for sale at 98 yuan, and 200 bags were being negotiated.

Spring and Autumn

### It's Hard to Travel in the Capital

-- Zhi Cang

The food in Shanghai is certainly hard to eat, and bread and butter are not easy to find, but walking around here, to this day, feels even more difficult. Walking on the street, you have to be as careful as possible, like walking on thin ice, as if facing a deep abyss. You also need the great skill of observing in all directions and listening in all directions: If someone is careless and starts a fire, the police siren will sound wildly, the crowd will panic, and everyone will spread the news and avoid it, as if a great disaster is at hand. Once the truth is found out, one can't help but smile wryly. It is also a common thing for prostitutes to solicit customers and engage in fierce brawls, but it will also cause a commotion among pedestrians.

Sitting idly at home, crying and sighing, feeling that the days are like years, is really unbearable, so you stroll out. After some time, you come back and suddenly your coat is stripped off, your leather shoes are missing, and you return with your head down and barefoot. This is already commonplace and not surprising. Although there are inevitably some people who like to show off and like to be out in the bustling streets, judging by common sense, ladies wearing gray backs and sea tiger coats probably have to join in the "fun." You must never "flee in panic" on Yangyang Xiaolu, where it is not easy to take care of the guard.

If it is dusk or midnight, then the principle is to "sit at home in closed doors." Even if it is earlier, you can take the tram, where "the public can sit," but according to general "national economic" principles, it has now reached the point of "taxing the people and wasting money." It is "said" that French Concession trams will raise prices again from February 1st, and to make up for the lack of one cent in the market, it will round up and add a few more. This is called "the public" unable to bear it, although there is no shortage of corner tickets on the market. The "special surcharge" will not "allegedly" be added forever, which can also prove "it is impossible to travel" in one aspect.

### A Dilemma

-- Jin Yi

Husband: Every day, I squeeze three liters of rice, but the maid eats two-thirds of it. Let's let her go next month.

Wife: That's good, but you have to go to the office, and I have to take care of the children. Who will go "queue up"?

### Stage and Screen

-- A Hui

Zhou Qimuni and others have agreed with the 拱宫 [Gong Palace] authorities to perform a drama there in the short term.

Xu Qingfeng is excavating the Gonghe Hall in the New World to turn it into a theater and is recruiting film actors to collaborate on performances.

### Primer

-- Ya Xi

Beggar (running after the rickshaw): Sir, please be kind and save me! I haven't eaten for four or five days! ... Save me! ...

Passenger (angrily): Damn! You're talking nonsense! If you haven't eaten for four or five days, how can you run so fast!

### Begonia

-- Qin Shouou

17. Homecoming

Begonia was simply gathering all of his remaining energy to listen. On his thin face, which was scarred and as yellow as wax, there was a kind of expression that had never been seen before.

"However, the way he did it was very much to the liking of my old man. Anyway, if a daughter is born at home, she will always have to be married. As long as people don't look down on us, everything will be done according to etiquette. As far as my brother sees it, ordinary people may not even be able to ask for such a thing!" Old Han's words implied that he regretted that people had not pursued his daughter.

The patient on the bed closed his eyes tightly and remained silent for about four or five minutes.

"Age… age… so… so young… people…," Begonia turned half of his body with great difficulty, turned his face to the outside of the bed, and said in a voice that was low enough for only Han's father and daughter to hear clearly: "Just… just go out… out every day… to… to make trouble… can… can that… count… as… a… a… a good… good… good child?"

As he spoke, he shook his head slightly, indicating that he was very dissatisfied.

"When a boy gets to this age, who doesn't want to go out and play?" Old Han was a rather open-minded fellow. "It's rare to see a young man as gentle as this."

Begonia still shook his head disapprovingly. (321)
