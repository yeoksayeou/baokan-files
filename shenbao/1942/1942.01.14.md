### Fall of Dutch Tarakan, Fierce Fighting in Celebes, Japanese Troops Landing Meet at Tondano

Tokyo, 13th (Domei News Agency) - The Japanese General Headquarters announced that the Japanese Navy today sank the Dutch mine-laying ships "Van Oranje" and "Kawi" (1,291 tons each) while they were trying to escape from Tarakan Island. At the same time, Japanese troops who occupied Menado in Celebes (Sulawesi) Island advanced to Tondano and joined forces with the Japanese troops who landed at Kema, successively occupying the Kakas aerodrome. Four Lockheed Hudson heavy bombers and three other types of bombers were shot down there. Japanese aircraft also destroyed one twin-engine bomber and one Flying Fortress in the Tarakan area.

Tokyo, 13th (Haitong News Agency) - The Imperial General Headquarters announced last night that the Dutch East Indies army on Tarakan Island, North Borneo, had surrendered unconditionally to the Japanese army. It was also said that no bloodshed occurred when the Japanese army occupied the city of Menado on Celebes Island.

Batavia, 13th (Reuters) - A communique was released here today stating that the Dutch garrison on Tarakan Island, off the Dutch East Coast, has surrendered due to being outnumbered. A small detachment has withdrawn to the mainland.

Batavia, 12th (Havas) - Dutch East Indies military authorities recently released a battle report stating that both Tarakan and Celebes Islands are in the midst of "fierce fighting." Military figures here are expressing anxiety about the fate of the Japanese landings on both islands. It is generally said that the Japanese army has decided to make Tarakan and Menado their initial targets for attacking the Dutch East Indies. The reason for this is likely because Celebes and Dutch Borneo contain the richest oil fields in the Dutch Empire and even the world. Now that the Japanese army has landed, the only option is to launch a large-scale counter-offensive immediately. The Dutch East Indies urgently needs a large number of aircraft.

Batavia, 12th (Havas) - A local radio station recently announced that Tarakan Island has likely been occupied by the Japanese army. The Dutch East Indies garrison is limited in number and far fewer than the Japanese army. The Japanese army has invaded the oil fields and cannot be stopped. All oil wells have been destroyed. The island will not be able to refine kerosene for at least the next six months.

### Kuala Lumpur Battles Shift South Towards Seremban, Defenders Deployed North of the City, Japanese Vanguard Approaches Johor

Tokyo, 13th (Domei News Agency) - After occupying Kuala Lumpur, the Japanese army on the Malayan front has taken advantage of the victory to advance towards Seremban, 35 miles to the southwest. The city is 160 miles from Singapore. The British army has deployed defenses north of the city. As for the operational situation of the Japanese army's left wing on the east coast of the Malay Peninsula, although there is no confirmed news, it is thought that its vanguard has approached the Johor border.

Singapore, 13th (Reuters) - A Reuters correspondent accompanying the army on the Malayan front today described the situation before the fall of Kuala Lumpur, saying that the Malayan war situation is bizarre, and the final days of Kuala Lumpur were particularly bizarre. The British army's withdrawal was depressing to talk about, but the troop withdrawal from Kuala Lumpur was truly a great miracle in the war history of this area. For more than 50 miles along the north-south trunk road, soldiers and vehicles moved in an endless stream for nine hours. The reporter followed the army through Kuala Lumpur, and explosions thundered behind him, as bridges were being blown up. The scene in Kuala Lumpur was strange. Residents freely distributed goods, and withdrew using bicycles, rickshaws, ox carts, and cars to transport clothing, food, alcohol, and the like. When we left the city, thick smoke rose up, presumably the station was on fire. We drove towards Seremban, where engineer units were digging trenches at the famous "Kajang Pass." There will be several days of silence before the Japanese army's victorious pursuit makes contact with the British army's outpost line.

London, 12th (Havas) - The Daily Mail recently published an article commenting on the Far East war situation, stating briefly that although recent battle reports are very scarce, what is known is that the Singapore fortress has encountered a serious crisis. The port must be defended, because once the port is lost, the Dutch East Indies will also inevitably be lost. A greater defeat will inevitably follow.

Japanese Aircraft Again Heavily Bomb Singapore

A Certain Japanese Army Base in Malaya, 12th (Domei News Agency) - Japanese naval aircraft, braving adverse weather and intense anti-aircraft fire this afternoon, raided Singapore for the first time, heavily damaging the enemy's positions and hitting several military targets. All Japanese troops returned to their original defenses safely. It is reported that Japanese aircraft have already conducted four night raids on Singapore.

Singapore, 13th (Reuters) - Officials stated today that Japanese aircraft attacked Singapore three times yesterday in formations of seventy, twenty-three, and thirty-five aircraft, with bombers escorted by fighters. Allied fighter planes all took off to respond. The Japanese fighters were Army Type 97s.

Tokyo, 13th (Domei News Agency) - The General Headquarters announced today that Japanese aircraft bombed the Tengah Airfield in Singapore twice yesterday, and 16 British aircraft were shot down. All Japanese aircraft returned safely to their bases.

Rangoon, 13th (Reuters) - The Army and Air Force Headquarters released a communique last night stating that as of 5:00 PM, no Japanese aircraft had appeared over Rangoon. Japanese aircraft activity has also decreased throughout Burma. British aircraft have flown to reconnaissance Japanese-occupied areas. In addition, British and Japanese scout teams engaged in an encounter battle on the northern border of Thailand.

Tokyo, 13th (Haitong News Agency) - The Japanese Imperial General Headquarters announced yesterday that Japanese bombers sank two enemy submarines and one large freighter in the Strait of Malacca. Japanese aircraft assisted the army in operations in southern Malaya, bombing British fleets with considerable success, and destroying a British train. They also destroyed 24 British tanks near Tantanbian, between Kuala Lumpur and Singapore.

### Philippine Islands Battle Report

Tokyo, 13th (Domei News Agency) - In the Philippine Islands battle, the Japanese army has already controlled the neck of the Bataan Peninsula. 50,000 American troops are now entrenched along the foothills and coast of Mount Natib (1,280 meters high) in northern and central Bataan, determined to defend to the death. The Japanese army is currently bombarding the American artillery positions. Japanese infantry, assisted by aircraft, has launched a fierce offensive. The sound of heavy artillery can even be heard as far away as Manila.

Washington, 13th (Havas) - The Department of War recently released a battle report stating that fierce fighting continued all day along the entire Philippine front.

### Allied Supreme Commander Wavell Assumes Office, Headquarters Said to be Located in Surabaya, Admiral Hart Also Arrives in Dutch East Indies

London, 12th (Havas) - General Wavell, Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces in the Southwest Pacific, has assumed office today. Although the location of the Supreme Headquarters has not been officially announced, it is generally expected to be within the Dutch East Indies, most likely the port of Surabaya. According to Reuters reporters, General Wavell had obtained full assurances regarding substantial reinforcements before agreeing to take on the important task of Supreme Commander. Unfortunately, General Wavell's assumption of office coincides with the darkest moment of the Pacific War. In short, Kuala Lumpur in Malaya has already fallen. Although the city is no longer very important strategically, and the nearby airfield may have already been destroyed, after its fall, Port Swettenham on the western coast of Malaya will soon be untenable. General Pownall, Commander-in-Chief of the British Far East Forces, stated in a broadcast speech yesterday that Britain must defend the port of Singapore at all costs, and emphasized that the British General Headquarters should concentrate its efforts on defending this fortress. The news that the Japanese army had landed on Tarakan Island and Menado in Celebes Island in the Dutch East Indies had long been expected here. Menado is a good harbor, only 400 miles from Davao Port in the Philippines. Tarakan Island, although a small island, is home to the world's richest oil fields. It is expected that all oil wells on the island have been destroyed by the Dutch East Indies. Leaving economics aside, strategically, this small island is also extremely important. If the Japanese army can consolidate its position on the island, it can use it as a springboard to attack the islands of Java and Sumatra.

Washington, 12th (Havas) - The Department of the Navy announced that Admiral Hart, Commander of the United States Asiatic Fleet and Commander of the Allied Joint Fleet in the Southwest Pacific, has arrived in "a certain location in the Dutch East Indies."

US military experts will be appointed to direct Chinese military operations within the Guizhou and Yunnan provinces.

Rangoon, 13th (Reuters) - The Governor of Burma, Sir Reginald Dorman-Smith, delivered a speech on the evening of the 12th, urging the people to donate generously to help the bombing refugees. The military authorities are trying to cope, and civilians in various places should also step up all preparations.

### US to Allocate Huge Sum for Rubber Production

Washington, 12th (Havas) - Federal Loan Administrator Jones recently announced that the government has decided to allocate $400 million for the production of synthetic rubber.

### Knox Delivers Speech at US Mayors' Annual Conference, Says Atlantic Remains Main Battlefield, Military Strategy Being Planned in the Pacific

Washington, 12th (Havas) - Secretary of the Navy Colonel Knox delivered a speech at the Mayors' Annual Conference this month, stating briefly that the Atlantic Ocean remains the main battlefield. The US Navy should protect the lifeline at sea between England and the United States, in order to defeat Nazi Germany, because Nazi Germany is the main enemy of the United States. As for when our navy will begin a decisive battle with the Japanese navy, it is not convenient to announce at this moment. What can be said is that such a major war will not occur in the near future. However, you must know that what I am saying is not that I am keeping the Pacific Fleet inactive. Once the military strategy is in place, action can be taken. The US Navy General Headquarters did not transfer the Atlantic Fleet to the Pacific, which was a wise move. In short, once our country is sufficiently prepared, we can strike them anytime, anywhere, and we will never act rashly before preparation is complete. We all know who our main enemy is, which is neither Japan nor Italy, but Nazi Germany." Regarding the work the US Navy is undertaking in the Atlantic War, it is currently not convenient to announce, because announcing it would only be exploited by the enemy. In short, the sole purpose of the United States is to defeat the enemy in the shortest possible time.

### A Short History of the German Paratrooper Training (Part Two)

"We know that there is often truth in tradition. We want to find a compromise; listen less to General Douhet and more to General Mitchell. Among senior military officers, Mitchell was the first to see that the usefulness of the air force was more than just auxiliary, and he knew that the air force was a completely new force. If it is to be fully developed tactically and strategically, it must have independent command and management, and at the same time, it must be coordinated with other military departments and obey a commander in order to exert its power and serve the country.

In any case, at this time we are confident that we have answered the two main points of contention of traditional militarists. First, our medium-range bombers, in cooperation with submarines, have greatly troubled the enemy's maritime transport lines. The statistics released by the General Staff show that the air force is responsible for a quarter of the enemy ships sunk since the start of the war; submarines are responsible for 60 percent; and surface raiders are responsible for the rest. Second, after the landing of paratroopers in Yingzhou, the air force can indeed occupy the enemy country and conquer it. The old men each have independent command, and can cooperate perfectly without losing the opportunity. We can say that we have adjusted the functions and effectiveness of the army, navy, and air force and combined them into one."

Leaving aside strategic planning, the preparation and strength of the paratrooper units are indeed one of Germany's two major military secrets. As for the existence of paratroopers, there is no way to hide it, so it cannot be called a secret. The other secret is the amount of military supplies stored, which is difficult to accurately estimate, even the number of existing aircraft and their production capacity.

Perhaps the most unfathomable thing is how Germany was able to hide from the military attachés of various countries' embassies in Berlin and import enough silk to manufacture a large number of parachutes. The military attachés of various countries' embassies are responsible for collecting this kind of secret statistics. However, at that time, no one seemed to notice that silk in Germany, whether for civil or household use, had long been regarded as a precious luxury item. Silk shirts were the rarest in men's clothing, and even those who were particular about clothing could not easily buy them.

After the outbreak of the war, a worker in a factory in Hanover discovered a new substance or a new manufacturing method. People in the air force, other than saying "this is a silk compound," refused to give you a more detailed explanation. In any case, this person has already received generous rewards and has been promoted to general manager in a factory that manufactures parachutes in large quantities. In addition, parachutes can also be made of hemp and wool.

The origin of the application of parachutes in warfare cannot be traced. They were already widely used in the last World War to spread spies and saboteurs behind enemy lines. In 1917, General Mitchell advocated organizing a team of trial paratroopers. In this way, the invention of paratroopers should probably be attributed to Mitchell as the first person.

However, among modern countries, the vibrant Soviet Union was the first to implement it. When Soviet Russia's aviation enthusiasm was at its peak, dozens of tethered jumping towers were built (there was such a thing at the New York World's Fair), and parachute teams were organized. Soviet aviators gave parachutes a nickname, called "Death's Rose." However, the Soviet Union has not seen much development in this area. The second country to think of training paratroopers was France. However, the French concept did not focus on large-scale paratrooper attacks, but on how to tactically use soldiers who were proficient in several languages to jump into enemy territory alone and serve as detectives. This idea, unfortunately, fell into the old routine of the last European war. However, the advanced French military expert, Major Lang Giron, also called the paratroopers "aerial regiments."

After studying the results of neighboring countries' experiments, the Germans turned to General Mitchell's view that paratrooper units must be self-sufficient combat units, and in combat, they are the main force, not a group of adventurers who specialize in luck. Udet, the famous air hero of the last European war, was the first contributor to the construction of the German paratrooper units. The short and capable Udet is still a bachelor, gentle in nature, good at having fun, and often trains parrots and practices target shooting in his apartment. He was very popular in Cleveland and other aviation competitions, and he also shot two famous films. Most of the American veteran aviators are very close to him. Now he is a lieutenant general, responsible for technical planning and production. In the German Air Force, his position is as important and his power as great as that of Along the way Goering.

### Foreign Banks' Chinese Deposits: Unlimited Withdrawals Starting Next Week; HSBC Announces Seven Measures

After the Shanghai branches of the nine Allied banks resumed business the day before yesterday (12th), they still paid depositors and savers in cash yesterday (13th) morning according to the first batch of payment methods. There were not many depositors of the banks who had not withdrawn 2,000 yuan since December 6 of last year, so there was no bank run in each bank. The payment of the second batch of deposits, which was originally scheduled to start on the 13th, has been decided by the Japanese supervisors of the Allied banks to postpone it for a few days. The banking industry expects the date of the start of payment of the second batch of deposits to be announced within this week, and the date may be next week. It is generally expected that the amount of cash payment for the second batch of deposits of several major Allied banks will be set at about 50%. The payment to the people of the Allied countries is still limited to 2,000 yuan per month. There should be no restrictions on people from other countries withdrawing deposits. If so, then of the deposits that people from other countries had on December 6 of last year, after deducting the first batch of 2,000 yuan that has been withdrawn, half of the remaining amount can be withdrawn in cash, and the other half will be transferred to the Japanese banks that are clearing the Allied banks.

The foreign exchange market was quite calm yesterday morning, and the transactions were also small. The market price in the central district exchange shops was 16.8 to 17 yuan per US dollar in legal tender, and the lowest price per Hong Kong dollar was 2.5 yuan in legal tender. There was no change in military tickets.

HSBC Deposits: Unlimited Withdrawals

In addition, according to HSBC's official announcement the day before yesterday, any people who are not citizens of Japanese enemy countries can withdraw personal deposits from the bank without restrictions from today. British, American, Belgian, and Dutch nationals who have not withdrawn the full 2,000 yuan can withdraw the full amount. Those who have withdrawn the full 2,000 yuan can withdraw 500 yuan per week from 50% of their deposit balance. HSBC also announced seven measures for depositors to withdraw money the day before yesterday, which are recorded below:

Seven Measures for Announcing Withdrawals and Deposits

From today (the day before yesterday), each depositor can withdraw the initial withdrawal amount of 2,000 yuan from the deposit balance on the 6th of last month. From today, each depositor can withdraw 50% of the current deposit balance (that is, the balance on the 6th of last month after deducting 2,000 yuan), which is the second withdrawal. The amount of deposits that have been withdrawn must be deducted from the above two withdrawals. Each depositor's deposit balance has been transferred to Yokohama Specie Bank to open an account, but all future transactions will still be handled at this bank.

Two Types of Deposits: Temporarily Frozen

The following deposits will be temporarily frozen: (A) Chinese deposits exceeding 10,000 yuan will be unfrozen after the Japanese authorities have made a decision on the interests of depositors; (B) Deposits of depositors who owe debts to this bank will be unfrozen after their debts have been cleared. Depositors whose deposits have been transferred (that is, those whose deposits have been transferred to Yokohama Specie Bank) must bring their checkbooks to the bank and have them stamped with the "Yokohama Specie Bank" seal. British, American, Belgian, and Dutch nationals' withdrawals from new deposits at Yokohama Specie Bank are still subject to previous restrictions. In addition, there are no restrictions on withdrawals from deposits of people from other countries.

Charitable Organizations Allowed to Withdraw Expenses

In addition, HSBC has allowed various charitable organizations, such as hospitals and associations established to help the poor, to withdraw necessary expenses. As for the withdrawal of commercial deposits, no decision has been made so far. It is said that the previous method of withdrawing 40 yuan per week per employee has been abolished. British, American, Belgian, and Dutch banks are still in the process of clearing. The clearing procedures adopted by the Japanese liquidators are still unknown.

### Shanghai Municipal Council Organizes Wheat Stock Registration

Wheat transfer permits can be obtained from Office No. 801 of this bureau. Each bag weighs 100 kilograms and costs 5 jiao. Wheat stocks are not allowed to be transported by car.

### Seven Major Public Utilities to be Taken Over by the Japanese, Managed by the Central China Development Company

According to a local dispatch from Domei News Agency, the Japanese officially announced yesterday (13th) that the seven public utility companies in the Shanghai International Settlement will be placed under the jurisdiction of the Japanese authorities, and representatives from Japanese organizations affiliated with the Central China Development Company will be sent to manage each company.

### Selling Noodles at Higher Prices: Twenty-Six Businesses Punished; Punishment Campaign Strictly Enforced

According to the English-language Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury, today (13th) it was revealed that the Shanghai Municipal Council has launched a punishment campaign against those who sell flour, bread, and noodle shops in the settlement at prices exceeding the limit since last week. A total of twenty-six were initially punished, including ten that were closed for three days, five that were fined 100 to 150 yuan, and one that had its inventory confiscated. Before launching the punishment campaign, the Shanghai Municipal Council spent a week investigating a total of 1,543 flour shops, etc., and found that about 300 of them sold at prices exceeding the limit, accounting for about 1/2 of the total. Although the Shanghai Municipal Council's work in this area last week focused on flour, bread, and noodle shops, the council's investigators also found many cases of candle prices exceeding the limit.

Bread Sold at Higher Price: Fined 8,000 Yuan

At the same time, nine bakeries in the French Concession were severely punished for selling at higher prices. Didis Coffee Shop (815 Avenue Joffre) was fined 8,000 yuan and all its flour inventory was confiscated. Kraft Bakery (806 Avenue Albert) was fined 3,000 yuan. Lao Da Fang Tea Shop (619 Avenue Joffre) was fined 500 yuan. Stefani Bakery was fined 500 yuan. Five other businesses, including International Confectionery, had their business licenses revoked as a punishment.

Fu Hsin and Fou Feng Flours Sold Out

The Shanghai Municipal Council's flour office has been allocating flour to flour and noodle retailers since the 14th of last month. As of yesterday, it has been a month, and the total number of flour extracted from Fu Hsin Factory No. 7, Fu Hsin Factory No. 2, and Fou Feng Factory, a total of about 60,000 bags, has been completed. The Shanghai Municipal Council stipulates that the limited price for each bag is 38 yuan. The raw materials for the flour in each factory were mostly made from foreign wheat purchased on the market in October of last year. The cost is about 45 or 6 yuan. In order to comply with the bureau's limited price, the factories have made great sacrifices. The bureau has repeatedly given written commendations to the factories for their spirit of cooperation, in order to encourage them.

Three Warehouses to be Opened Today

Starting today, the Shanghai Municipal Council has reached an agreement with the Japanese to open the flour warehouses of Jin Cheng, China, and Dong Lai to release flour. The limited price per bag is still 38 yuan, and it will continue to be allocated to various noodle product merchants for door-to-door sales. In addition to the above three warehouses, there are still many other flour warehouses that the bureau has contacted to open successively. Therefore, judging from the current situation, the supply of flour in this port will not be in short supply. If retailers exceed the limited price of selling products, the bureau will severely punish them.

### Rice Dealers Must Pay Cash or Check for Buying Stacked Foreign Rice, Handling Fee of 5 Yuan per Thousand Yuan in Cash; Closed Rice Dealers Request to Merge Operations

The Shanghai Municipal Council's Rice Office previously entrusted the British firm Arnhold & Co. to collect the rice payment for the rice dealers who were selling stacked foreign rice. Now, in order to save procedures and facilitate collection, the foreign firm notified the city's rice dealer association yesterday, requesting that it inform all member rice dealers that all payments for purchasing foreign rice in the future must be made in cash or check. If cash is still used for payment, a handling fee of 5 yuan per thousand yuan will be charged. The rice dealer association has now informed all rice dealers to handle this matter. It is expected that rice dealers' purchase of foreign rice will become more rapid in the future.

Rice Warehouses Shipped 5,000 Bags

Yesterday, the rice offices of the two authorities designated rice dealers in the French Concession to ship rice from the Roosevelt warehouse, and rice dealers in the Public Concession to ship rice from the Hu Feng, Dong Lai, and Mao Tai warehouses. Yesterday, a total of 5,000 bags of stacked foreign rice were moved out of the warehouses throughout the day. However, it was rumored that the Jin Cheng warehouse had been unsealed, but all rice dealers who received rice did not know. Yesterday, only the power company moved out some foreign rice because the warehouse is north of Suzhou Creek (Gansu Road). It is heard that the Shanghai Municipal Council and the Japanese are still in negotiations. The rice warehouse may be opened in the near future, allowing rice to be shipped out.

Closed Rice Dealers Contact to Merge

This time, the two authorities ordered more than 700 rice dealers to stop operating, and neither domestic nor foreign rice was allowed to be sold. However, in order to take care of the livelihoods of the employees of the stores and to facilitate the purchase of rice for the citizens, the rice store owners jointly requested permission to continue selling domestic rice, but they were still not approved by the two authorities. It is now learned that the rice store owners have again suggested to the two authorities to increase the number of rice dealers selling foreign rice, and to merge the closed rice dealers separately and sell rice jointly. They are currently in contact one after another. However, it is learned that a few rice stores have changed their facade and sold other goods.

### Yarn Market Rises in One Go, But Returns to Fatigue

The cotton yarn market is trending weak, and the price of Shuang Ma yarn is falling sharply. This is due to the failure to solve the shipment problem. The momentum of those who sell off is increasing, and the market is under pressure and tending to downstream. However, other yarn prices are still stable. In fact, the circulation of spot goods in the market is particularly lacking. The opening price of 20-count Shuang Ma factory single is still stable. The opening price of the first market is 1,840 yuan, but the momentum on the table is still tight. It rose slightly to 1,865 yuan. However, due to the high price, there was a crowding of sellers, and many floating owners spit out, gradually falling to 1,770 yuan. It revolved here for a long time. Unexpectedly, the rumors became more prevalent, saying that the warehouse will be unsealed soon, and the chips are full, and the selling is getting stronger and stronger, falling straight to 1,690 yuan. By the time of closing, the short covering rose slightly to 1,710 yuan, which was 125 yuan lower than the previous day. The spot price of 20-count Shuang Ma is 2,120 yuan to 080 yuan, 20-count Tian Nu is 2,640 yuan to 2,685 yuan, 20-count Shuang Earth is 1,910 yuan to 1,950 yuan, 10-count Boy Scout is 1,430 yuan, 6-count Rouge Tiger is 1,755 yuan, 16-count Airplane is 1,960 yuan, 20-count Yueqin is 2,240 yuan, 20-count Blue Phoenix is 2,510 yuan, 42-count Blue Phoenix is 4,100 yuan, 40-count Jin Cheng is 3,450 yuan, 60-count Sunlight is 8,000 yuan, and 42-count Fairy Peach is 4,085 yuan.

### Spot Goods are Insufficient, Factory Cloth is Higher than Dong Goods

The factory cloth market was stable yesterday. The selling prices of each cloth vary depending on the amount of bottoming. The prices increased by 2 yuan and decreased by 1 yuan. Hua Die coarse cloth is still shouting 114 yuan, and spot goods are extremely rare. Da Peng fine cloth is 90 yuan, and Fugui is more than 80 yuan, which is much higher than Dong goods, which is also due to the lack of goods. The Benchang and Yihe coarse cloths are flat. The Yihe Tongyi coarse cloth factory single is 10 yuan to 15 yuan less than the spot goods. More than 200 pieces were traded on this street, and 40 to 50 pieces were traded by Ningbo traders.

The Dong cloth market was sluggish yesterday due to the actual sales of Mukes, and the market continued to fall. The opening price of 12-pound Longtou fine cloth factory single in the morning was 87.25 yuan, the closing price at noon was 86.25 yuan, and the closing price in the evening was 85.75 yuan, which continued to fall by 2 yuan per piece compared to the previous day. However, it is gradually approaching the spot price of Longtou. The fine cloths such as Caiqiu, Yanghe, and Laba are all 84 yuan, and Feiyu is 84.5 yuan, with a slight drop of about 1 yuan, which is still firm in the sluggish market. Since the scattered households sold the new orders of October of Sizijun Serge, the price of Babu fell to 3.09 yuan, and another 6.5 cents per yard.

### Government Bonds Seem to Have Recovered, Foreign Stocks Have Supply But No Demand

In the over-the-counter market for government bonds, the price has rebounded to between 8.3 and 8.9 yuan, and trading seems to have resumed. Speculative buying and selling appear to be resurging among various groups. On one hand, spot goods are flowing out, while on the other hand, there is buying interest, making it difficult to ascertain the cause. Type C bonds initially opened at 63.2 yuan, but due to heavy selling from Xinhua, the price quickly dropped by three yuan. Tongsheng and Tongyi bravely bought in, and the market price gradually rose. Tongyuan, Hu Heji, Xie Xingyuan, and Qian Yi all sold at various times, but the market price remained firm. Type C bonds ultimately closed at 63.8 yuan, Type A bonds rose from 68.2 yuan to between 68.8 and 68.95 yuan, Type B bonds rose from 64.6 yuan to between 64.8 and 65.2 yuan, ultimately closing at 65 yuan. Type D bonds were traded at 60.02 yuan, and Type E bonds were traded at 61.5 yuan, rising to between 62.5 and 63.7 yuan. The trend is firm but weary, and the unnaturally high price does not align with the environment. Many changes are expected in the future. The total transaction volume was still between 700,000 and 800,000 yuan.

Yesterday, the over-the-counter market for foreign stocks at the Public Chamber of Commerce saw only slight fluctuations. Wheelock Marden was at 62 yuan, Shanghai & Hongkew Wharf was at 30 yuan, with bids for 29 yuan. Tramways was at 30 yuan, Langkat Oil was at 12 yuan, and Asia Navigation was at 8 yuan, all with bids. The Shanghai Land Investment was at 13.5 yuan, Ewo Cotton Mill was at 26 yuan, Ewo Brewery was at 6 yuan, Shanghai Woolen Mill was at 6 yuan, Steel Works was at 20 yuan, and Paper Mill was at 6 yuan, all with supply but no demand. Shanghai Kelantan Rubber Estates was at 21 yuan, and the rest had no quoted prices.

### Gold Market Firm But Weary, Military Notes Approach Four Yuan Mark

Yesterday, the spot gold market became increasingly stable but showed signs of fatigue. Although trading still occurred in four locations, telephone hedging further suppressed market prices, fostering stability. In the morning, the initial transaction price was as high as 11,500 yuan per tael (ten liang). A gold shop sold twenty taels to a jeweler for 11,520 yuan. The highest price was reportedly 11,550 yuan for ten taels. Although a gold shop and Guangdong traders bought in later, the active selling by Tong Kangyong, Xiang Xingyong, Ming Lan, and De Cheng led to a gradual decline of 300 yuan, down to 11,250 yuan. Suddenly, Cheng Ji, Tong Kang, and Yong Fu bought in, raising the price to 11,420 yuan. Securities firms sold off, and the price fell again to 11,300 yuan. Small money houses then bought in, reaching 11,350 yuan at noon, a slight decrease of 100 yuan from the previous day. There was a difference of 300 yuan during the day, with a total transaction volume of 1,200 to 1,300 taels. Jewelers' selling price for gold ornaments was reduced by Da Xin and other firms at 11:45 am from 1,250 yuan to 1,200 yuan (reducing the purchase price by 200 yuan). Standard silver remained at 16 yuan. The over-the-counter price fluctuated between 11.5 and 12 yuan.

Yesterday, in the foreign exchange market, only British and American gold pounds weakened slightly by five yuan along with the spot price. The former was 265 yuan, and the latter was 270 yuan. American currency notes remained at 17.12 yuan. Hong Kong notes remained at 2.5 yuan for buying and 2.7 yuan for selling. Military notes rose slightly to 3.92 yuan.

Yesterday, the discount rate for drafts and bills of exchange remained at three yuan per thousand yuan or leveled off. The interest rate for interbank lending at the Money Dealers Association remained at six percent and has not changed.

### Arrivals Gradually Increase, Prices Fall Uniformly

The rice market weakened further yesterday. Southern varieties of glutinous rice have fallen below the 200-yuan mark, while foreign glutinous rice has fallen to 176 yuan. The prices of all varieties of japonica rice fell uniformly. Early and late rice have also neared the 200-yuan mark. This is because arrivals have been continuous, while sales have been rare due to the closure of most rice shops. In addition, with the public sale of rice in the southern part of the city and western Shanghai, and rumors of Vietnamese rice coming to Shanghai, confidence has waned, and selling pressure has increased. Yesterday, japonica rice fell by another five or six yuan, and early rice fell by two or three yuan. Northern Gao Kun japonica rice was priced at 228 yuan to 226 yuan, and Southern early rice was priced at 200.05 yuan to 203 yuan, while late rice was priced at 200.01 yuan to 201 yuan. Reported arrivals in the market totaled more than 400 bags, but less than 300 shi (a unit of dry measure) were traded.

The wheat market has been quiet for a long time, and wheat bran has also been hoarded. However, yesterday, merchants and traders inquired about Dongzhan foreign flour, which has not been traded for a long time, and the market atmosphere was revitalized. However, those holding the goods demanded at least 50 yuan, based on high costs, which was the price they had opened at last month. But buyers were only offering 40 yuan, a significant difference, making a transaction difficult.

Commentary

### A Final Request

— Jin Yi

Buying rice and getting one's hands and feet hurt, or even encountering "accidental shootings," such "unfortunate events" have all been reported. Besides lamenting being born at the wrong time, what else can one say! However, if you don't eat, you'll be hungry. To solve the hunger problem, you still have to "queue up" properly; hence this final request!

Since each rice shop has a fixed number of bags of rice to sell each day, then it is easy to calculate how many sheng (a unit of dry measure) are in each bag, and how many sheng are in dozens of bags. Thirty times one is thirty, and you don't need a scientific calculator to get an accurate number. Thus: If there are, for example, a thousand sheng, then sell to those who come first, from number one to number one thousand, like "registered mail," and don't accept any more when you're full. If you're late, you can only blame yourself for being too slow and look for another rice shop.

If this is the case, whether you are truly number one thousand or the nine hundred and ninety-ninth person, your sheng of rice will always be guaranteed. Dinner might be a little late, but late porridge is fragrant and warm, saving the whole family from crying.

However, nowadays, people often queue all day, squeeze all day, and wait all day, only to be turned away by the "sold out for today" notice and have to make other plans, probably when the roads are empty. Not being able to buy rice leads to complaints, and to avoid "failure," everyone wants to "get ahead," making it difficult to maintain order. Therefore, my final request is that when the cart arrives at the rice shop's door, immediately post a notice: "Rice sold today: x thousand numbers." As long as your number is on the "winning list," you can rest assured and "save up to wait."

At the same time, with a fixed number, the rice shop owner's "relatives and friends" can't secretly "smuggle" in the back door. For example, if the fixed number is one thousand, selling nine hundred and ninety can still be said to be "slightly off," but it can't be less than nine hundred and ninety-eight, otherwise the loss would be too great.

I believe this request has many benefits and no drawbacks, and it only takes a simple action. I hope the authorities of the two settlements will adopt it!

### New News from the Entertainment World

— Yi

Carlton will restage Peking opera. It is rumored that he has sent someone north to discuss terms with the famous female performer Wu Suqiu. If the negotiations are successful, the opening performance will be held during the new lunar year.

The Longmen Grand Theater, which specializes in Yue opera, will be taken over by the China Drama Society, organized by performer Hou Jingfu, to stage spoken dramas after the contract with the Yuehua Troupe expires on the 16th of this month.

The second animated feature film, "The Queen Bee," which I previously mentioned in this column had been aborted, has now been confirmed. All 100 plus students of the Guolian Animation Department were given severance pay of 100 yuan each by the authorities and were officially disbanded last week.

Yue Feng's new film following "White Orchid" is "Human Desire Runs Wild," written by Yu You. The plot tells a tragic story about hereditary syphilis. According to Yue, "Using film to introduce to the audience the horrors of syphilis infection will have a shocking effect because we see this disease spreading so rapidly in Shanghai!"

Minhua's new film "National Beauty and Heavenly Fragrance" has been completed. The company may shut down afterward and stop filming.

Sixteen: The Fire of Youth

"They sell their songs, and they go into every restaurant," the waiter said, almost laughing at Shao Hua's naivety. "But since they had that fight with the guests in number eight that night, they've been a little timid, fearing that someone might be waiting for them here, so they haven't been here for the past two days."

"Ah...!" Shao Hua suddenly understood, gave the waiter a dollar, quickly paid the bill, and rushed out.

Unfortunately, he waited at the second large restaurant until ten o'clock but still did not see Mei Bao and the other three. There weren't even any other singing girls. Instead, the waiter of the restaurant, peeked his head in once, twice, three times, looking at him suspiciously. Finally, he could only quickly settle the bill and leave.

On the third and fourth days, it happened to be Yuhua's birthday, and his family was constantly entertaining guests, making it impossible for him to sneak out and pursue this matter.

"That child's manner is very strange, as if he has something on his mind!" Xiangqi, being an observer, saw Shao Hua's distracted state while entertaining guests and secretly discussed it with his mother.

"I have no intention of managing him anymore!" Jin Yu was truly an indulgent mother. "Boys who have grown up like this are always like wild horses. Being cooped up at home for the past two days naturally makes him feel restless!"

Xiangqi勉强nodded, but inwardly did not agree with her sister-in-law's statement, because she knew that although Shao Hua usually liked to play, he had never been so distracted at home, as if he had gotten into some trouble outside. However, Shao Hua was, after all, only her nephew. Although there was something suspicious about his expression, his parents didn't ask, and Xiangqi naturally did not feel it appropriate to interfere with him. Besides, Shao Hua's manner was only suspicious, and there was no abnormal behavior at all! (303)

### Depressed New Year Cake Market

— Xin Meng

At the end of the lunar year, the new year cake market in Shanghai has opened as usual. With various industries showing stagnation and recession, the new year cake market, though勉强open, is no exception, and it is far from as lively as in previous years. The new year cake market in Shanghai only lasts for two months, from the winter solstice to the new year. In previous years, the streets and alleys were full of new year cake shops and stalls, but this year there are only a few scattered ones, as if they are勉强decorating. Even the scale is far smaller than in previous years, right?

The main reason, of course, is the price of new year cakes. Because of the high price of rice, new year cakes have also risen too much, to 1.2 yuan per pound. One yuan only buys five or six strips, which is many times more than the one fen (one cent) per strip before the war. New year cake is not an essential food. Although some people bought new year cakes to replace rice when rice was most scarce, this situation has disappeared in recent days as there is a bit more rice. Eating new year cake as a substitute for rice is ultimately uneconomical.

Ningbo new year cakes occupy the largest proportion of the new year cake market in Shanghai, followed by Suzhou new year cakes. But sugar new year cakes and lard new year cakes cost three or four yuan per catty (about 1.3 pounds), so the glass cabinets of cake shops and confectionery stores display only a few new year cakes as a seasonal food decoration.
