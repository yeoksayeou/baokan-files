Stockholm, 30th, Huitong News Agency - According to a Singapore dispatch published in the London Times, the sound of Japanese artillery fire has been heard in Johor Bahru at the southern tip of the Malay Peninsula. Japanese troops are bombarding British transportation lines. Japanese troops are attacking Singapore in three routes, aiming for a decisive battle in Johor Bahru. The eastern route of Japanese troops has reached the Sudiely Highway, the central route is advancing along the Kulai Highway, and the western route of Japanese troops is advancing towards Pontian Basong.

Tokyo, 30th, Allied News Agency - The Japanese army's advance on Singapore continues to make progress today. They have crossed Apit Apit on the west coast (about 20 miles from Johor Bahru) and Kulai (the fourth railway station, 18 miles from the Johor Causeway). After occupying Apit Apit, the Japanese army has controlled the entire Strait of Malacca. After the Japanese army, advancing south in central Johor, occupied Kulai, they are now advancing rapidly towards Singapore along the highway parallel to the railway, while clearing out the remnants of Australian troops resisting along the central Johor railway. The Japanese army on the east coast of Malaya is now no more than 35 miles from Singapore. It is reported that after one route of the Japanese army on the central front occupied Kulai, it suddenly turned northeast to join forces with the Japanese troops who landed and advanced south on the east coast of Enlau, crushing the Australian troops north of Gemas.

Tokyo, 30th, Huitong News Agency - It was revealed here last night that, according to enemy prisoners, the British army originally planned to fiercely resist the Japanese army's southward advance 60 miles north of Singapore on the Malay Peninsula. The defending forces on this line were mainly Indian troops, who were unable to stop the Japanese army's advance. Many also fled the battle. From January 23, the main force composed purely of British troops began to arrive, but it was difficult to reverse the declining trend.

Tokyo, 30th, Huitong News Agency - It has been 50 days since the Japanese army landed on the Malay Peninsula. During this period, they have occupied a total of 900 kilometers of land. Japanese engineers have built 200 bridges in these 50 days, greatly assisting the Japanese army's advance.

It is known that the Sultan has recently been monitored by British police or is still being detained by the British.

Singapore, 30th, Reuters - Starting today, Singapore will implement a curfew from 9:00 PM to 5:00 AM the following morning. However, this ban will not apply whenever there is an air raid alarm until ten minutes after the alarm is lifted.

### Street Scene of Singapore

Singapore is a prosperous commercial center, densely populated, and the only major port in the Nanyang Islands. The city's roads and streets are wide and can be considered first-class in the Far East. Because there are so many overseas Chinese there, the street scenes are very Chinese in character. Taking a tour of the city, it is as if one is in Guangzhou, with posters in Mandarin, Japanese, and English (top picture). Ninety percent of the people seen on the streets are overseas Chinese. The police directing traffic in the city are also very special. In addition to their uniforms, they all carry a rattan shield on their backs, as if they have added wings to their bodies. This rattan shield is used instead of a traffic baton. People who come to Singapore for the first time cannot help but notice and find this kind of traffic police (bottom picture) a very strange outfit.

### Churchill Declares Britain is Confident in the War, Britain and the United States Have Pooled Resources, Beaverbrook to Head New Production Department

Stockholm, 30th, Huitong News Agency - According to news from London, yesterday was the third day of debate in the British House of Commons. Before holding a vote of confidence, Prime Minister Churchill made another speech, stating that all the resources of Britain and the United States have now been pooled. A Raw Materials Bureau will be established in London, similar to the one organized in Washington. The arrival of American troops in Britain is the wish of the American people and leaders, allowing British troops to reinforce the Far East. It is currently impossible to predict the outcome of the Johor battle, but it is known that reinforcements have been arriving steadily in recent weeks. The sinking of the "Prince of Wales" was due to the lack of an aircraft carrier at the time, but he did not want to excuse it. He believes that Britain is confident in the final victory, and everyone must act according to their conscience.

London, 29th, Havas - Before the House of Commons passed the vote of confidence in the government, Prime Minister Churchill answered questions, stating, "It is difficult to predict the fate of Johor Bahru and Singapore at this time. However, I can assure the members of the House of Commons that fresh British troops and aircraft are currently being sent to reinforce them. Regarding the sinking of our battleships 'Prince of Wales' and 'Repulse' by Japanese aircraft, our dispatch of these two battleships to the Far East was in the 'hope that this would keep Japan out of the war, or at least prevent the Japanese General Headquarters from dispatching merchant fleets to the Gulf of Thailand. The United States had issues in Hawaii and had no time to spare. At the time, there was no American battleship. The 'Prince of Wales' was the only battleship that could reach the area to deal with the overall situation.' As for the general situation of the war in the Far East, I am willing to take full responsibility for the 'general military arrangements,' but this does not mean that I will not investigate the malfeasance of responsible officers. We have indeed made serious mistakes, but it is even more absurd to think that this weakness is the reason for the setbacks suffered by Britain and the United States due to the temporary loss of maritime hegemony in the Pacific. Even before the Pearl Harbor incident, the chances of British success were greatly reduced due to the Japanese army's entry into Vietnam and the establishment of extremely valuable bases there. If our country had not been fighting in the Nile River Valley and other areas, it would have been able to deal with the Japanese invasion of Vietnam. However, Britain cannot fight Germany, Italy, and Japan alone. Although we hold valuable contacts at staff meetings in Singapore with the United States, the Commonwealth of Australia, and the Dominion of New Zealand, we are 'deeply concerned' about the development of the situation. Our parliamentary system is the most perfect. In today's world, there is no wartime government in any country that can participate in debates and accept criticism from all sides. The main task of the House of Commons is to produce an effective administrative organ. I have benefited greatly from this House debate and will consider the opinions expressed by all parties, even those put forward by the opposition to the Cabinet. As for the alliance between Britain and the United States, all resources of the two countries are now concentrated in one place and used jointly. In addition, regarding the war in Libya, North Africa, one thing can be asserted: the war in Libya seems to be able to create a second front, so that the German army cannot attack the Caucasus. 'In any case, from now on, the Nile River Valley can rest easy.' In short, although the offensive we have adopted in Libya is not as important as the war on the Eastern Front, this move has forced the enemy to withdraw a large number of air forces from the Eastern Front in this critical moment."

Stockholm, 30th, Huitong News Agency - A dispatch from London stated that political figures in London predict that Lord Beaverbrook will be appointed Minister of Production. The establishment of the department was requested by the Labour Party, and Prime Minister Churchill accepted the proposal to appease the Labour Party. It is not known whether the Labour Party agrees to have Beaverbrook head the department.

### Soviet Announcement of Recapture of Sukhi̇nivichi, etc. – Crimean German Forces Repulse Soviet Troops – Italian Newspaper Reports Soviet Use of Secret Weapons on Eastern Front

Moscow, January 30th, Reuters – The Soviet Supreme Command announced last night: “After fierce fighting yesterday, Soviet troops repulsed the German counterattack in the central sector and recaptured the cities of Sukhi̇nivichi (central sector), Lokhvitsa (southwestern sector), and Pavlograd (southern sector).

Berlin, January 30th, Transocean News Agency – Military experts supplemented yesterday’s German war report, stating that Allied forces on the Eastern Front continue to inflict heavy blows on the invading Soviet troops. On Wednesday, we received reports of unsuccessful Soviet landings on the southern coast of Crimea. After several days of fighting in the freezing snow, the German-Romanian Allied forces inflicted heavy casualties on the Soviets and completely defeated the Soviet attempt to advance eastward from Feodosia via the sea to attack the German rear. The Soviets value their Crimean base and spare no sacrifices, launching bloody attacks, but the results are still nil. The German Air Force, under extremely adverse weather conditions, is still striving to assist the army in combat, while also striking at enemy transport lines. Yesterday’s communiqué stated that Soviet transport planes were shot down by German aircraft, indicating that Soviet front and rear communications have been cut off, or at least a considerable number of Soviet troops are surrounded, forcing them to transport supplies by air. Reviewing the situation on the Eastern Front, it is clear that although the Soviet troops are constantly counterattacking, they have not yet achieved their intended goals, namely, they have neither conquered Kharkiv nor Smolensk, nor have they broken through the encirclement of Leningrad.”

Rome, January 29th, Havas – Local newspapers today carried dispatches from correspondents stationed in Berlin, stating that German military authorities have recently discovered two types of secret weapons used by the Red Army on the Eastern Front. The first type is “attack aircraft,” called “demolition aircraft,” equipped with several machine guns and a small cannon. The fuselage is protected by thick iron plates, which cannot be damaged unless by intense anti-aircraft fire. They are quite effective in low-altitude bombing, and their speed is unmatched by ordinary aircraft. This type of aircraft appeared at the beginning of the German-Soviet war, but in small numbers, and had no major impact on the war. The second type is heavy-tonnage tanks, called P34. As early as October last year, the Red Army used this type of heavy-tonnage tank, which advanced as usual under German direct-fire artillery fire, without any obstacles. However, two vehicles were destroyed by German “suicide squads” using hand grenades and transported back to Germany for expert research. It was learned that the iron frame of this type of tank is not only thick but also made of special materials, which cannot be destroyed by bullets and shrapnel. In view of this, German military authorities have manufactured bullets that can penetrate this type of tank, so that the Soviet Union no longer has secret weapons. In addition, German engineers are now working hard to manufacture terrifying weapons in preparation for launching an offensive next spring.”

### Anglo-Soviet-Iranian Treaty Officially Signed

### France Denies Dakar is Being Used by Germany

Dublin, January 29th, Havas – The President of the Executive Council of the Republic, Mr. de Valera, stated in the House of Representatives in response to a question from a member: “Regarding the rumor that German paratroopers have landed in Southern Ireland and have made actual contact with the Irish Republican Army, if it proves to be untrue, those who spread the rumors, once identified, will be handed over to the military commission for disposal.”

Washington, January 29th, Havas – The U.S. naval budget of 2 billion U.S. dollars, including the funds needed to manufacture 27,000 new-type combat aircraft for the navy, is currently under study by Congress.

As for the manufacture of 27,000 new-type combat aircraft, it is part of President Roosevelt’s plan to strengthen the U.S. Air Force.

### Plants That Can Fill Your Stomach in Times of Famine

Written by Professor Li Te of the Lester Institute of Medical Research

At the beginning of the 15th century, China had a book called "Emergency Food Plants," which listed 414 kinds of plants that could fill your stomach in times of famine. Many of them are cited as having nutritional value in Western books. These plants are divided into five categories: grass, trees, grains, fruits, and vegetables. Each plant listed in "Emergency Food Plants" has a woodcut illustration. At that time, Europe did not yet know the art of woodcut. Although these woodcuts were much more sophisticated than later European woodcuts, they lacked scientific details. The leaves of the plants were not clearly depicted, so many plants cannot be accurately identified. The rest, however, are clearly and accurately depicted, with their names and descriptions, so there is no mistake.

The identified plants of each category are listed as follows:

Grass (A) Leaves and Stems: Plantain, Inula, Calendula, Wild Meal Dumpling, Daylily (Yellow Flower Vegetable), Fennel, Dayflower, Small Peach Red (Phoenix), (B) Roots: Lily, Ophiopogon japonicus, Glehnia littoralis, Calamus, (C) Seeds and Fruits: Muslim Rice, Cedrela sinensis, Tribulus terrestris, Cock’s Comb Fruit, (D) Leaves and Buds: Dock Seedling, Groundcherry, Cocklebur, Rubia cordifolia Seedling, Vaccaria segetalis, (E) Roots and Leaf Tips: Burdock, Cattail Shoots, Apricot Leaf Glehnia littoralis, Hosta Shoots, (F) Stems: Sagittaria trifolia, Bamboo Shoots, Nymphoides peltata.

Trees (A) Leaves: Albizia julibrissin, Hibiscus syriacus, Poplar, Toona sinensis Sprouts, (B) Fruits: Ziziphus jujuba, Lonicera japonica, Mountain Rowan, (C) Leaves and Fruits: Lycium chinense, Toona sinensis Peach Tree, Cypress, Cudrania tricuspidata, (D) Flowers: Wisteria sinensis Vegetable, Sophora japonica Sprouts, Catalpa bungei, (E) Flowers, Leaves and Fruits: Pyrus betulifolia, Xanthoceras sorbifolium, (F) Leaves, Bark and Fruits: Mulberry Tree, Elm Seeds.

Grains and Related Genera: Tender Leaves and Seeds: Buckwheat Seedlings, Sesame, Soybeans, Broad Beans, Perilla frutescens Seedlings.

Home Fruits and Tubers (A) Fruits: Water Caltrop, Soft Jujube, Wild Grape, Wild Cherry, (B) Fruits and Leaves: Pomegranate, Apricot Tree, Jujube Tree, Peach, (C) Stems: Hairy Taro, Water Chestnut, (D) Stems and Seeds: Coix lacryma-jobi.

Vegetables (A) Leaves: Amaranth, Purslane, Beet, Erigeron annuus, Winter Mallow, Polygonum hydropiper Sprouts, Clover, Japanese Catnip, Shepherd's Purse, Taraxacum mongolicum, (B) Stems: Stachys geobotrya, (C) Stems and Leaves: Wild Onion, (D) Leaves and Fruits: Shepherd's Purse, Perilla frutescens, Lambsquarters, (E) Stems and Seeds: Yam.

The above and other plants total 414 kinds. It can be seen that any plant, if the taste is not too bad, can be eaten, and the number is certainly large. However, there are also those that are harmful to the body if eaten in excess. For example, Forsythia leaves contain glycogen, and Sorrel, like rhubarb leaves, contains oxalic acid, which is harmful to the kidneys and causes blood in the urine. Acorns can cause severe dysentery. In recent years, ignorant people in the oil head area have used the ground powder of Cibotium barometz as food. Cibotium barometz originally contains toxic substances, and there are many cases of poisoning and hospitalization.

In this short article, a slightly more detailed description can be given of several kinds of plants that have already sprouted or will soon sprout.

Dandelion is a very common vegetable, and has been eaten by people all over the world since ancient times. It can be planted by oneself and harvested in spring. The leaves are large and tender, with a slightly bitter taste. It is known for containing protein and mineral salts. The phosphorus and ash it contains are better than spinach, calendula, or lettuce. Its magnesium content is also better than lettuce and cabbage. It also contains important metals such as iron, copper, manganese, and zinc, and is rich in vitamin C.

Shepherd’s Purse is a wild vegetable that is sold in the market. It has a delicious and slightly spicy taste. Its basic chemical composition is the same as that of dandelion. The amount of vitamins A and B1 it contains is the same. Iron and vitamin C are more abundant, and it is rich in iron, ash, and other minerals.

Plantain is a weed that grows all over the world. "Emergency Food Plants" calls it a sweet and non-toxic vegetable. Its tender shoots can be harvested and cooked with oil and salt to fill the stomach. The seed-bearing flower spikes are very rich in vitamin B1.

Dayflower, also known as Bamboo Leaf Vegetable, its tender shoots can be used as food, and it turns old when it blooms blue flowers. Regarding many other plants, such as Purslane and Quinoa, people in other countries also like to eat them. There are several kinds of garden quinoa, which are often sold in the market.

### Urgent Population Census Time – International Settlement Volunteers Assist Police – Those Leaving Shanghai to Return to Native Place Should Quickly Prepare Application Procedures

The International Settlement Volunteers will assume civil duties on Sunday, the first time since the outbreak of the Pacific War that they will take over some police work from the Municipal Police, so that the Municipal Police can send more personnel to expedite the population census of the Public Concession. About 200 Volunteer members will be dispatched to take over police work. However, according to the International Settlement Volunteers, it has not yet been decided which unit will be dispatched. It is heard that the population census of the Public Concession will be conducted by 600 people, all of whom are Municipal Police personnel, and it will take about two weeks to complete. All preparations for the formal population census in the two Concessions have been completed.

How to Divide Households is Determined by Oneself

The period for the formal population census in the Public Concession and the French Concession has been delayed for a long time. Now the two Concessions are scheduled to conduct the population census simultaneously from February 1st. The population census form is divided into two copies, the original and the duplicate, and is distributed according to the house. Each taxpayer (i.e., the second landlord of each house, the manager of each business organization) should be responsible for truthfully filling out the form and retaining the duplicate of the population census form (printed in red). Each household or business organization should fill out one form. Each taxpayer should determine for themselves how to divide those who stay overnight in their houses into households in the most appropriate way. For example, how to divide households if the entire house is a residential household, how to classify people into their affiliated business organizations if there are several business organizations living in one house, and how to classify a part of the people into the residential household and a part of the people into the business organization if the house is a combination of residential households and business organizations. However, each person is only allowed to fill out the form once. The items required to be filled out in the form are: Name (Adult males who are unemployed should add a small circle next to their name to indicate), the head of the household's title for each person, province of origin, gender, age. Each taxpayer must designate one person in their house before February 1st to immediately inform the investigators, accompanied by the constables, how many population census forms are needed for the house. Each Chinese population census form can fill in the names of 20 people, and each foreign population census form can fill in the names of 15 people. However, it should be noted that each form is only allowed to fill in one household or one organization. All those who stay overnight in the house must be filled in, otherwise, there is no need to list them. Travelers staying in hotels and inns should each fill out a form. Managers and staff of business organizations who do not stay overnight in the office should not be filled in, but the manager of the business organization must sign and seal the population census form. The original copy of the population census form (printed in black) will be collected by the investigators two days after it is issued (for example, if the form is issued today, it will be collected the day after tomorrow). Taxpayers should be responsible for reviewing each form to ensure that it is filled out truthfully, and should collect the original copy of the population census form (printed in black) in advance, ready to be delivered when the investigators arrive. Taxpayers who fail to comply will be severely punished.

Expanded Handling of Return to Native Place Applications

The format of the return-to-native-place permits application forms issued by the Works Department Building Permit Issuance Office and its newly established offices in the Northwest, East, and Three Northeast Districts have been changed since yesterday. The items to be filled out are more comprehensive, including (A) the name of the person leaving Shanghai, divided into head of the household, family members, and individuals, (B) the address in Shanghai, (C) a summary of the profession and skills before leaving Shanghai, (D) the name of the factory or other workplace, (E) the address, (F) the name of the manager or person in charge, (G) the professional skills of the unemployed, (H) the amount of salary and wages received in December 1941, (I) the intended address, and (J) the intended route, divided into waterway or land route, with the name and address of the ship or station noted.

Branch Offices Established

The Works Department established three new branch offices yesterday to handle the issuance of return-to-native-place permits and travel fare discount coupons. A considerable number of people who had previously obtained permits went to the respective offices again to apply for discount coupons. Those who obtained discount coupons paid half price for boat tickets or third-class train tickets. If a group of 200 people left Shanghai at the same time, they could also pay half price for fourth-class train tickets. The three new branch offices of the Works Department were established at Nie Zhongcheng Public School (Jingzhou Road, Baker Road), Works Department Elementary School (Aierjin Road, Keneng Hai Road), and another Works Department Elementary School (Singapore Road, Jiaozhou Road). At the same time, the Fuzhou Road Volunteer Headquarters also issued permits and discount coupons. Each branch office (excluding the main office) is open as usual on Saturdays and Sundays. Since the establishment of the first office of the Bureau on the 5th of this month, a total of approximately 44,500 permits have been issued. Those who have received permits said that they no longer need to queue up to buy rice. According to the estimate of the visa supervisor, the four offices can issue 5,000 permits per day. If more offices are added, this number can be increased.

Enthusiastic Group Applications

The Bureau's Industrial and Social Affairs Department has issued several thousand permit application forms to various factories. Factory employees fill out application forms for employees and their families and send them to the visa office for permits and travel fare discount coupons. Yesterday was the first day of the establishment of the new office, and several factory representatives brought application forms to obtain permits. Any factory that wants to obtain an application form can request it from Office No. 609 of the Industrial and Social Affairs Department or any visa office. As for the issuance of travel fare discount coupons, it ends on February 15th, so there are not many days left. Those who want to leave Shanghai to return to their native place should apply quickly to avoid missing the opportunity.

### French Concession House Tax Collected According to New Valuation – Approximately Doubled, Tax Rate Unchanged

It is learned that the Concession has changed the method of collecting house tax from January of this year. That is, all rents will be revalued, and the average increase in the same period last spring will be 100%. However, the amount of increase for those who have been occupied for a long time and those who have not been occupied for a long time is not uniform. The house tax of 30% will be collected again according to this new valuation. For example, if the original house price is 100 yuan per month, the house tax of 30 yuan per month was collected according to the 30% tax rate before. From January of this year, the calculation standard has been changed, and the house price will be increased by 100% uniformly, that is, 200 yuan. The house tax will be changed to 60 yuan per month according to the 30% tax rate again. There is no change in the original tax rate.

### Principal and Interest of Consolidated Bonds Paid in Chongqing – Shanghai Branch Not Temporarily Handling

The 12th redemption of the five types of consolidated bonds has been completed for types A, B, C, and D. Type E has been temporarily changed to be held in Chongqing. The principal and interest due for the winning numbers will be paid by the Central Bank and the China Communications Bank entrusted by it from tomorrow. However, the Shanghai branches of the Central Bank and the China Communications Bank will not temporarily handle the payment. Other banks have also suspended collecting principal and interest on behalf of customers, so the principal and interest due for this period cannot be collected in Shanghai. It is heard that various small money houses in the market are willing to buy the winning bonds, but they are discounted by 15% up and down according to the face value. As for the uncollected winning bonds and interest coupons of the 11th period, the Shanghai branches of the Central Bank and the China Communications Bank have also stopped paying them. Shanghai will not handle the payment for the Republic of China 25-year Revival Public Bonds due at the end of February and the Republic of China 17-year Financial Long-Term Public Bonds due at the end of March, and they will be handled in the same way as the consolidated bonds.

### Eight Robbers Arrested at Yile Tian Teahouse

Feng Baishun, Chinese Chief Detective of the Louzear Police Station, Deputy Chief Detective Huang Fusen, and Detectives Yang Yun, Liu Zhaonian, and Ma Bingzhang, secretly reported yesterday morning that many fierce robbers were tasting tea and discussing matters at the Yile Tian Teahouse on Nanjing Road. They rushed to the address and arrested Hu Lao Yi (32 years old, Wuxi), Lin Zhengyu (24 years old, Ningbo), Yu Jinshan (26 years old, Yuyao), Wang Jinxiang (28 years old, Shanghai), and Chen A Jin (26 years old, Ningbo) on the spot. According to the confession of the robbers, they continued to arrest the robber gang members Wang Shiyu (21 years old, Ningbo), Cao Guisen (24 years old), and Chen Miaogen (20 years old) at 11:50 a.m. at Room 21, Qichang Hotel, No. 6, Lane 588, Hankou Road. Two fake pistols were found and taken to the police station for interrogation.

Two Police Stations Escorted 20 Fierce Robbers

Chinese Detective Chen Jinsheng and Li Yinmin of the Xinwen Police Station arrested the robbers Qian Xiaojin, Zhou Fengyan, Qian Jinchang, Qian Shunshan, Chen Tunan, and Qian Rongshan in Room 462, Jueshi Hotel, No. 250, Yu Qiaqing Road, a few days ago. It was found that these people had committed no less than a dozen cases of theft and extortion of huge sums of money by writing threatening letters in the Concession. Due to lack of time, it is still difficult to investigate in detail, so they were escorted to the court yesterday to request temporary detention for investigation before formally filing a complaint. The court briefly interrogated them and ordered another hearing.

### New Time Implemented Starting Midnight Tonight

In order to save electricity and increase office efficiency, the two Concessions will implement daylight saving time early, starting at midnight tonight, advancing the clock by one hour. The closing time of various entertainment venues such as dance halls, nightclubs, theaters, and cinemas will also be changed to 10:00 p.m. new time. The running time of trams in the two Concessions and buses in the French Concession will also be changed according to the new time, leaving the factory and entering the factory earlier. It is also learned that the time report of the Xujiahui Observatory will also be based on the new time, and the clock on the Jianghai Customs and Post Office Building will be advanced by one hour starting at midnight tonight.

### It is Said that French Concession Trams Will Increase Prices Starting Next Month

It is learned that the price increase of French Concession trams has been approved and will be implemented on February 1st. The new fare for first class will increase from 18 cents to 20 cents, and then increase by 5 cents per stop. The longest distance from Xujiahui to the 16th Pier has increased to a high price of 50 cents. The fare for third class will be at least 15 cents, and then increase by 1 cent or 2 cents per stop, but the odd numbers will be added to 5 cents or 10 cents, for example, if the original price is 22 cents, it will be 24 cents after adding 2 cents, and then add 1 cent to make up 25 cents. The highest will be 30 cents.

### The Rental Housing Problem Must be Considered as a Whole

According to a public announcement from the Works Department Information Office, the entire issue of managing the subletting of houses is still under consideration by the Bureau. Before the regulations are approved and promulgated, citizens are requested not to submit the proposed subletting methods to the Bureau for approval or apply to the Bureau for mediation of disputes.

### Works Department Rice Sales Office Will Only Sell Broken Rice Starting Today

### Guohua News Agency Established – Started Sending Drafts on February 1st

Since the preparation of the Guohua News Agency began, it has been generally ready. It is scheduled to officially send out drafts on February 1st (this Sunday). The internal composition of the agency has a long history in the news industry, and the reporting work has always been in-depth. Therefore, the reporting of various news is fast and accurate. It is an emerging force and will definitely contribute to the newspaper industry.

### False Alarm at Tianyun Lou the Night Before

At about 8:00 p.m. the night before, a vicious fight occurred in the rooftop flower enclosure of the Wing On Company due to prostitutes soliciting customers, which caused a misunderstanding. Pedestrians avoided it, and shops closed. After the Old Zha Police Station sent detectives to find out the truth, the matter was calmed down. As a result, the police station arrested three men who caused the incident and escorted them to the First Special Court yesterday and prosecuted them for violating the prohibition, sentencing the three defendants to a fine of 15 yuan each as a warning.

### Lost Leather Wallet

I picked up a leather wallet containing banknotes and other sundries in a tram car (car number B59) on the way east to west on Shandong Road at 9:00 p.m. last night (January 28). I handed it over to ticket seller No. 571 and asked him to hand it over to the general writing room of the tram company at No. 185 Suzhou Road. If you have lost it, please go to the above location and explain the correct numbers to claim it. Wang Qianqi

### 申報 Reader's Aid Fund for Students - Reader's Letters Respond - Appeal to All Sectors to Donate - Free and Half-Price Enrollment Opportunities Continue to Be Open for Application Today

Our newspaper yesterday received a letter from reader Mr. Shicheng, earnestly appealing to all sectors. The original letter is as follows: "With the general economic decline in Shanghai, the pursuit of education for young people has become a major challenge. On one hand, some families are suffering from unemployment or reduced income. On the other hand, tuition fees are generally increasing due to the financial difficulties of schools. The cost of educating children, which was already a significant burden for middle-class families, has now become almost unbearable. Seeking a way out of this predicament, the reader's aid fund promoted by this newspaper is perfectly suited to this need. The number of applications has reached thousands, which precisely illustrates the widespread danger of dropping out of school due to economic threats. Moreover, it is unknown how many more have not even had the opportunity to apply for various reasons. How can the tens of thousands of dollars currently available be sufficient to address this issue? The immense difficulty in reviewing and selecting applicants can also be imagined. The only remedy is to increase the amount of aid. One more donation of a hundred or ten dollars means one less young person being left out and dropping out of school. But this can only be achieved by appealing for enthusiastic support from the community. Of course, the economic capacity of people in Shanghai is now vastly different from what it used to be. Even those with substantial assets are experiencing various difficulties. However, given the size of Shanghai, providing educational expenses for a few thousand or even more young people should not be a problem. Amidst this chorus of austerity, are there not excessive extravagances everywhere? Think of the tension among these thousands of young people caught between their desire for knowledge and the danger of dropping out of school. The rapid expansion of the aid fund should be a shared responsibility."

Free and Half-Price Enrollment Opportunities

The application for the reader's aid fund of this newspaper closed on the 26th. We are currently organizing and reviewing the applications, and the list of approved aid recipients will be announced soon. However, there are still remaining free and half-price enrollment opportunities donated by various schools. The names of the schools and departments are listed below.

### Spot Goods Flood the Market - Bond Market Collapses - Foreign Stock Trading Turns Active

The over-the-counter bond market continued to decline yesterday. Category A bonds broke the 70-yuan mark, and market sentiment remained sluggish with no signs of recovery. Category C bonds opened yesterday, immediately breaking 7 yuan to 66 yuan, 5 jiao. Subsequently, the price fluctuated between 66 yuan and 6 yuan, 2 or 3 jiao. Ultimately, due to strong selling pressure from Lianyi, Tongkang, Zhenchang, and Hu Heji, even though Dingkang, Yitai, Tongji, and Maoxin bought in, the supply still outweighed demand. The price broke 6 yuan again, reaching a low of 5 yuan, 7 jiao, before recovering to 6 yuan, 4 jiao at the close due to sudden demand from Tongyi. Category A bonds initially opened at 70 yuan, briefly reaching 69 yuan, 8 jiao before closing at 70 yuan. Category B bonds traded at 67 yuan, 5 jiao, falling to 7 yuan, 3 jiao before rebounding to 7 yuan, 8 jiao, and closing at 7 yuan, 5 jiao.

Category E bonds traded at 64 yuan, 5 jiao, falling to 3 yuan, 9 jiao before closing at 4 yuan, 1 jiao, resulting in a further decline of 5 or 6 jiao to 1 yuan. There were no buyers after the close. Trading volume was approximately 600,000 to 700,000 yuan.

Yesterday, foreign stocks rebounded strongly, and trading volume increased. A total of 7,600 shares of industrial and public utility stocks were traded, and 100 shares of rubber stocks were traded. It is rumored that HSBC Bank sent a letter to the Stockbrokers Association urging them to register transactions before December 8th. Therefore, there is speculation of priced settlements, and the current prices are too low, which stimulated buying interest and boosted market confidence. Jardine Spinning Mill saw the most trading activity, with a total of 1,300 shares traded. The price rose from 25 yuan to 26 yuan, but then sellers appeared, and buyers bid 25 yuan, 5 jiao. China Textile traded 1,000 shares at 8 yuan, 6 jiao. Tramway traded 500 shares at 32 yuan, 5 jiao, and 500 shares at 32 yuan. There were few sellers afterwards.

### Cash Transactions - Less Speculation

Yesterday's over-the-counter market for cash was less speculative, accounting for only 10 to 20 percent of transactions. The market situation was more stable. According to sources, the atmosphere was quiet and business was dull. In the morning, each tael (ten liang) was initially traded by two gold shops at 10,900 yuan, 20 yuan higher. Securities firms such as Tongkang Yong and a certain gold shop began to sell, and the price gradually fell by 130 yuan to 770 yuan. Yongfeng Yu Chengji bought, raising the price to 820 yuan. Afterwards, the price hovered around 800 yuan. At noon, the price was 10,810 yuan, 70 yuan lower than the previous day. The price fluctuated by 130 yuan throughout the day.

U.S. dollar notes were 15 yuan, 6 jiao and a half, Hong Kong notes were 2 yuan, 7 jiao and a half, and military notes were 3 yuan, 9 jiao, 8 fen, and 3 li.

### Rice Market Indirectly Softens

The selling price of Changshu Chen rice varies from 1670 yuan to 190+ yuan, depending on the quality of the goods. Newly arrived Wuhu rice is uniformly sold publicly at 150 yuan per shi. Therefore, market sentiment is indirectly softening, and buying interest is strong but turning stagnant. Northern rice and Baiyuan rice are weakening first, and early and late rice are also showing a flat trend. Kunshan Bai rice opened at 228 yuan to 224 yuan, Jintan glutinous rice at 207 yuan, and Southern early and late rice at 198 to 197 yuan. Approximately 300 bags were traded in the market. Only half of those reporting were present, and there were fewer small vendors and direct distributors, it is said.

Agar-agar has long been lacking in the regular market. Although there are occasional embellishments from informal over-the-counter transactions and direct distribution, the black market is secretly unverifiable. Reported prices vary. Yesterday, it was heard that American pink agar-agar was 49 yuan including fees, and Kanfen Golden Dragon brand was 45-46 yuan, with a few transactions, it is said.

### Most Miscellaneous Grains Return to Flat

The supply and demand for edible oil were both quiet yesterday, and transactions were calm.

Soybeans have stopped rising and turned flat. This is because scattered stockpiles are gradually being sold off at high prices. It is estimated that 80 bags of Tianjin new Jin Yuan soybeans were sold, priced at 142-143 yuan, one carload of Wuhu soybeans, priced at 122 yuan, and 20 bags of Pudong soybeans, priced at 124 yuan.

Red beans are still actively selling, and the supply is scarce, leading to an upward trend of 3-4 yuan. It is estimated that 50 bags of Chongming sand red beans were sold, priced at 89-90 yuan. Broad beans are trending stable. Yesterday, 50 bags of Chongming sand broad beans were traded, priced at 68 yuan.

Soybean cake transactions were slightly weaker yesterday, and stockpilers seemed less eager, so the price saw a decline of half a yuan. It is estimated that 2,000 pieces of Shenji soybean cake warehouse receipts in six lots were sold, priced at 26 yuan and a half to 26 yuan.

The corn market initially strengthened and then weakened, and the final result was similar to before. It is estimated that 100 bags of Dutch white corn were sold, priced at 52 yuan, and 200 bags of yellow corn, priced at 53 yuan, 150 bags of mixed yellow and old corn, priced at 53 yuan and a half, and 400 bags of new corn, priced at 57 yuan, 8 jiao at the Western warehouse, 57 yuan and a half to 55 yuan and a half at the Cambodian warehouse, and 59 yuan and a half delivered to the door. Also, 200 tons from Inghua, priced at 82 yuan to 82 yuan and a half for goods in the Hongkou warehouse, and 92 yuan and a half for goods in the Hongsheng warehouse.

The peanut kernel street sales continue, and the market continues to trend upward. Yesterday, more than 100 bags of Jiangbei new peanut kernels were sold, priced at 225 yuan, and 100 bags of Linzhun Guan new peanut kernels, priced at 195 yuan.

### Cotton Cloth Market Stable

Factory Cloth: The market was bleak yesterday. Fortunately, the current cloth market can remain stable, but there are few sales. Ten packages of 12-pound Dapeng fine cloth were traded, priced at 93 yuan, 7 jiao and a half per bolt. Xiaoji blue cloth was 153 yuan. Several dozen pieces of other miscellaneous brand blue cloths were traded in this street, priced at around 150 yuan.

Only the Four Gentlemen Serge was the softest, spot goods at 3 yuan, 5 fen, warehouse bill at only 2 yuan, 8 jiao, 4 or 5 fen.

### Yarn Market Still Stagnant

The cotton yarn situation was stagnant all day. This was because it was raining, and Tonghe Guli could not gather outdoors. Although some yarn merchants talked under the eaves, they could not gather due to the sparse number of people, making it difficult to complete transactions. However, the factory bill price for 20-count Double Horse was approximately 1,325 yuan, which was about the same as the previous day. However, the spot market was very strong, and the supply was very short. The market price was rising with no signs of decline.

### Sugar Shortage

Recently, the goods sealed in the foreign warehouses of the sugar market are not yet available. Only five or six thousand bags are stored in the local warehouses, which feels quite short. According to the market situation, prices must rise, with the increase for Zhenji No. 1 white being approximately 25 yuan, No. 1 ice sugar 10 yuan, No. 24 coarse white 30 yuan, Dutch red and cart red even scarcer, 20-30 yuan, and Taigu cart white 20 yuan, with a similar increase for cart ice sugar.

### Miscellaneous Jujubes Sell Best in Ningbo

Miscellaneous jujubes, such as Fu red and Chang red, are selling very actively in Ningbo. However, 2,000 to 3,000 bags have already been shipped, and there is a sense that supply exceeds demand, causing prices to fall in Ningbo, even to the point of being inverted. According to a telegram from Ningbo, the prices have rebounded by 4-5 yuan, but it is still difficult to approach. If the prices continue to rise, it will be cost-effective, it is said.

### Hawthorn Flakes Discontinued in Hong Kong

Hawthorn flakes are mainly sold to Guangdong and Hong Kong. However, since the outbreak of the Pacific War, shipments have been discontinued. Except for sporadic purchases by pharmacies, there are almost no inquiries. Therefore, the market price is gradually easing. It has now fallen by 20-30 yuan, and there is still a lack of a regular market, it is said.

### The Meaning of "Daylight Saving Time"

— Jin Yi

This year's "Daylight Saving Time" will be implemented early, starting at midnight today. Although the weather is cold and the year is ending, the sunshine, like golden velvet, cannot yet attract people's attention; however, after the neon lights are extinguished at night, the daytime is still more pleasing than the night.

"Daylight Saving Time" is simply moving the clock forward one hour. It does not have much impact on people who work several hours each day and then receive payment. For example, office workers who work "nine to five" actually work six full hours, excluding the lunch break from twelve to two. Arriving at the office one hour earlier in the morning and leaving one hour earlier in the afternoon does not reduce the need for electric lights during working hours, even with electricity restrictions. However, since the implementation of this movement, it is said to have had significant effects, so this year it is being implemented even earlier than last year.

Since the trams are brought into the depot earlier, the entertainment venues close earlier, and the "stimulation" of highway robbers is added, the people of Shanghai are now forced to improve their past "life without the sun." — on the surface, it seems to be quite close to this movement. However, getting up early and going to bed early only improves living habits, but does not increase the meaning of life. For example, going to a teahouse to sip tea and chat after getting up early is no different from chatting in a coffee shop at night. Therefore, the "Daylight Saving Time" movement should expand its meaning now. After "saving daylight," we should "utilize daylight," in other words, "increase production." Otherwise, merely moving the clock forward one hour is just changing the name of half a catty to eight taels.

### Stage and Screen

— A Hui

Nightclubs and dance halls have recently hired Li Ming and He Jianfei to direct a one-act comedy "The Mute Wife," performed by the dancers. The hall will also hold a charity tea dance at 4:00 PM on February 3rd, with Han Sen, Hong Jiong, and others participating in the performance. All proceeds, excluding expenses, will be donated to charity organizations.

A year ago, famous Shanghai Shen opera performers, with the assistance of many people engaged in theatrical work, organized the "Shanghai Huju Society." They removed the shortcomings of Shen opera, adopted new scripts, and new stage designs. They performed for a year at the Queen's Theater. Now, due to audience demand, after major expansion, they are scheduled to move to the Xuangong Theater today. The first play, "New Beauty Trap," is written by Song Chao, directed by Xia Tian, and performed by all Shen opera performers.

Li Pingqing's new work, "The Elegant and Romantic Noblewoman," is said to be adapted from "Scented Stationery Tears."

Guohua actors Murong Wan'er, Xu Feng, Zhou Chu, and others plan to take advantage of the abolished Lunar New Year holiday to perform "Lonely Soul in the Black Night" in Suzhou.

Qilin Tong will perform at the Golden Age starting on the abolished Lunar New Year, and Huang Guiqiu, Wang Xichun, and others have also been invited to perform. The popular plays are Tan-style plays such as "Battle of Taiping," "Fourth Son Visits His Mother," and "Empty City Stratagem." The highest seat price is ten yuan, and the performance period is one month.

Wang Yin's "Black Night Phantom" has been temporarily suspended due to actor issues.

Bai Yun has a contract with Guolian for a series of films, which will be fulfilled after Bai Yun's contract with Guohua expires.

Leisurely Chat on Self-Cultivation

### Watching, Listening, Doing

— Duck Creek Translation

The author of this article, M. F. Burlingame, is a famous American educator. This article is translated from his collection of speeches. The original text is very long, and the following is only an excerpt.

—Translator's Note

Young people, I sincerely hope that you will never forget the meaning of "self-study." Schools, bookstores, and teachers are only helpers. True education lies in your own efforts. Resolute, continuous, and diligent study can complete a very good self-education.

Education has two goals: first, to develop oneself; second, to acquire knowledge. The former means to stimulate and cultivate your personality, improve your memory and understanding, and enable you to learn a more rational way of life in this journey of life than before. As for the latter, it means learning the method of grasping the essence of things.

There are probably four sources for acquiring knowledge through self-study: 　It comes from observation. 　It comes from experience. 　It comes from conversation. 　It comes from learning. If you work hard in these four areas, then even without teachers and schools, you can still satisfy your desire for knowledge.

For example, when you are walking in the fields or forests, you can see many animals, birds, and insects. Do not harm or disturb them. You should silently observe their living habits, how they eat, how they walk, and you can also distinguish their types from hearing and sight.

A famous natural scientist once said: "My success today is entirely due to my meticulous observation of things." Follow his example! — Meticulous observation! Then you may also become a famous natural scientist.

I often feel that outdoor travel is the best learning opportunity. Because through this, you can get closer to nature and better understand nature. To be honest, nature is simply the best university. No school in the world can be greater, broader, have more subjects, richer specimens, and more convenient experiments than it. You don't need to go to California, or to South America, to the Arctic Circle, to find novel materials. Everywhere in the natural world is full of things that you "have never seen or heard before," waiting for you to study, observe, and learn.

When you have the opportunity to visit a factory, you should carefully observe the configuration of the machinery. You must study and think about how to generate immense power from a fixed point by rotating the lever and wheel. What is the reason for this? It is necessary to thoroughly explore the cause and effect. This is the spirit of a true scholar.

You can also get a lot of the knowledge you need from conversations. Whenever you meet someone, if you have the opportunity to talk, you should ask him to tell you about the things he is most familiar with.

A learned man was asked:

"How did you acquire so much knowledge?"

He replied: "I got it from the conversation of everyone."

Finally, I hope that you will remember: if you want to succeed, you should read, learn, observe, think, research, reason, and meditate, always and continuously watching, listening, and doing. As for whether or not to go to school, that doesn't matter.

Seventeen - Homecoming

"That's right, it's all him! That's why we went out late and came back early." Old Man Han said all the way, while also secretly looking at Qiu Haitang's expression. Therefore, he hurriedly and impatiently added an explanation. "But by the heavens, that young master has never been fussy, my daughter has also seen it. If I lied to you, I'm an old turtle!"

Qiu Haitang couldn't help but laugh at him.

"Moreover, Third Brother, he always gives the money to me or to my daughter first each time he pays. The questions he asks are always proper. Given how cultured he is, your Miss Mei Bao is still worried, and these days she must drag my daughter along. Third Brother, I really have to admire you for this!" Old Man Han said to this point, habitually giving a thumbs-up. "Listening to you, you used to be a performer too. I didn't expect your family education to be so good, and your Miss Mei Bao to be so obedient, it's truly enviable!"

After Old Man Han said this, Qiu Haitang felt a little happier, and the unhappy expression on his face disappeared for the most part.

"This...is...is what you said...said...the happy event?"

The Han family daughter couldn't help but laugh again.

"I haven't finished yet!" Old Man Han hurriedly winked at his daughter, and also made his attitude extra solemn. "We are now almost like brothers. Since you asked me about this matter today, I must tell you everything I know! To talk about that young master's character, there is truly none more upright, and he has a warm heart; but then again, no matter how upright his character is, no matter how warm his heart is, if he didn't have some intention, he would never be so good to us. Third Brother, you are a sensible person, so of course I can't deceive you. From the way he looks, he really took a liking to Mei Bao the first time he saw her, but..." (320)

### Béthune Road at Twilight

— Wu Han

With an empty heart, I strolled along Béthune Road with a friend. It was the twilight hour, with the sun setting and the new moon not yet risen. Dusk fell hastily on Béthune Road, with few pedestrians, displaying the transition from disarray to tranquility as the day drew to a close.

Gradually, it grew dark, and one could no longer see one's fingers. The grand apartments standing tall—such as Georgia—resembled the great bells in ancient temples, calmly and steadily veiled by the thin curtain of night. Dim yellow lights shone from the windows above the tenth floor. Initially, only a few scattered lights illuminated the space, but within six or seven minutes, almost all the dark window frames had transformed into a luminous world of colored glass.

We walked to the entrance of Sullivan's in the Western District, peering through the large street-facing glass window. We saw tables and chairs arranged inside, along with a row of high round stools beside the snack counter. Including the female clerks, there were only five people in total. Two young women sat perched at the counter, while a couple were sipping tea in the "pool area." They were all foreigners, which was not surprising.

I can't help but insert an anecdote here:

According to a friend, Sullivan's American-style bread now sells for $1.20 a loaf, and it is exceptionally white and soft. It is several times better than the half-baked, either over-baked or under-baked "mixed-color" bread found in the market. However, because it is only sold in the morning and the supply is limited, Sullivan's management has issued a "card" to those who regularly purchase the bread. Purchases are only allowed with the card, and no exceptions are made.

Recalling my friend's words, and looking at where we were standing, I couldn't help but long for the fortunate souls who come to purchase bread with their cards in the morning. After watching for a while, we walked south along the sidewalk. The spire of Xuhui Cathedral was no longer visible due to the thick night curtain. We only saw seven or eight bicycles, lined up head-to-tail, piercing through the darkness. The small light on the rear of each bike shone on the ground, and the weak light slowly faded away with the sound of the bell. Although they seemed very humble, in this era, in this "night" environment, they should not be underestimated.

### Snake and Horse

— Hainan

According to the lunar calendar, this year is the Year of Xin Si (Snake), and next year is the Year of Ren Wu (Horse). We are now at the time between the snake's tail and the horse's head. According to general predictions, this year is the Year of the Snake, so the "one-character long snake formation" is in power. To buy $4.33 of foreign rice, one must stand in a long snake formation. To buy 95 cents per pound of plain flour, or to get a return-to-hometown permit, one must also stand in line. Even withdrawing savings from the bank requires standing in a long snake formation. The long snake can be said to be enjoying its moment. Therefore, some people predict that next year, the Year of the Horse, Shanghai residents will surely "open up the docks," because of the sluggish market and the increasing cost of living. This year, many shops within the city walls will inevitably close down, and many unemployed young people will be forced to resign, leaving them no choice but to "open up their docks" and return to their hometowns.
