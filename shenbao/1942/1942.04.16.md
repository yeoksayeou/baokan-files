### Laval to Continue Cabinet Talks; Cabinet Announces Reorganization with Laval to Become Government Leader; Darlan Remains Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces

Vichy, 15th (Haitong Agency) – It is reported that after Pétain, Darlan, and Laval held two talks on Thursday, they will decide on the new government list and announce it. When the three gathered at the Garden Hotel yesterday morning, two key economic officials from the French and German authorities, namely Meisinger and Pailey-Farmer, were also present. The lineup of the new government is currently unknown. However, it is widely believed that Admiral Darlan will remain the heir apparent and Commander-in-Chief of the French Army, Navy, and Air Force, with the right to attend cabinet meetings, but will not hold a ministerial title. Laval will become the leader of the government, while Marshal Pétain will remain the chairman of the cabinet meetings, as in the past. Marshal Pétain will no longer have the power of the government leader, but Tonval will be responsible to Pétain.

Vichy, 15th (Haitong Agency, French Dispatch) – Secretary-General of the French Information Department, Marion, said yesterday that Laval's title will be the leader of the government. The titles of Prime Minister and Associate will be completely abolished. Laval will be responsible to the Head of State. Darlan will remain the heir to the Head of State, with the title of Commander-in-Chief of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, relinquishing the title of Minister, and will be able to attend all cabinet meetings. From now on, Pétain will only serve as Head of State, and the chairmanship of the cabinet meetings may be concurrently held by Laval.

Vichy, 15th (Haitong Agency) – The French government today officially announced to the French people the results of the discussions among Pétain, Darlan, and Laval. Well-informed sources pointed out that the cooperation between Pétain and Laval follows the Montoire policy, meaning close cooperation between Germany and France. Laval's appointment to an important position does not imply a complete change in the basic policies of domestic and foreign affairs. Laval has always understood France's true interests and can seek France's true interests in times of crisis, so Pétain invited him to come out.

Geneva, 14th (Havas Agency) – According to political figures here, once the talks being conducted by the French authorities are concluded, a new government can be formed in the country. It is expected that former Prime Minister Laval will serve as Prime Minister. From the Vichy communiqué stating that the French cabinet will establish a new government according to new principles, it can be seen that major changes will occur in the French political situation, not only personnel changes, but also changes in the form of government. Up to now, Head of State Pétain also concurrently serves as Chairman of the Council of State. In the future new government, the powers of the Head of State will still be held by one person and will never change. However, the powers of the Head of Government, that is, the Prime Minister, will be exercised by a person selected by the Head of State from among the cabinet members. It is expected that General Pétain will remain the Head of State, and former Prime Minister Laval will serve as Prime Minister, exercising his powers under the leadership of Head of State Pétain. As for Lieutenant General Darlan, the Associate of the Cabinet, according to the fundamental law, he will remain the heir to Head of State Pétain and will participate in cabinet meetings as the Supreme Commander of the Navy, Army, and Air Force. Based on this, although there will not be major changes in the fundamental organization of the government, there will be slight modifications in the organization of governance. In addition, there are various speculations about the selection of other cabinet members, and there is still no definitive news. However, political figures here expect the French government to officially announce the reorganization of the cabinet on March 16.

### News of the French Cabinet Reorganization Draws Attention from Britain and the United States; Rumors of France Possibly Declaring War on Britain

Stockholm, 15th (Haitong Agency) – According to sources from London, the reorganization of the French government has drawn attention from London. This new development is considered another defeat for the British and American alliance. London newspapers also discuss the exchange of opinions between London and Washington, so the United States may exert pressure on Vichy. Because rumors of the French government's reorganization circulated in London as early as Monday evening, there were already comments on this matter in yesterday's morning papers. The foreign affairs correspondent of the "Daily Mail" stated that the French fleet still has considerable strength, and the French army stationed in North Africa is also very strong, so France may declare war on Britain.

Berlin, 15th (Haitong Agency) – The German Foreign Ministry refused to comment last night on the Vichy communiqué stating that Marshal Pétain, Admiral Darlan, and Laval had decided to form a new French government, because it had not yet received information on this matter.

Lisbon, 15th (Haitong Agency, New York Dispatch) – The French communiqué stating that French Head of State General Pétain, Deputy Prime Minister Darlan, and former Prime Minister Laval have decided to establish a government based on new principles has drawn the attention of Americans. Within minutes of this news reaching New York, all American radio reporters declared that Laval's return to the cabinet was a consequence of the United States intensifying its policy of confrontation. Political circles do not believe that Washington will not issue an official statement on this matter in the near future. However, Undersecretary of State Welles will request the French Ambassador to the United States, Henry Haye, to explain the situation. Some people even believe that after Laval joins the cabinet, it may lead to the United States recalling its ambassador to Vichy, Leahy.

### US Ambassador to France to Be Recalled; US Newspapers Advocate Severing Ties with France

Buenos Aires, 15th (Allied News Agency) – Australian broadcasts received here state that the US Ambassador to Vichy, Leahy, will be recalled to Washington to consult with the US government.

Washington, 14th (Reuters Agency) – Well-informed sources expect that the US Ambassador to Vichy, Leahy, will be recalled. Senior US government officials frankly admit that it is necessary for Vichy to review the relationship between the United States and Vichy. However, it is pointed out that Leahy's recall does not mean breaking off diplomatic relations. Some people here predict that the United States will completely sever ties with Vichy and provide full support to the Free French. However, well-informed sources advise all parties not to draw conclusions prematurely.

Washington, 15th (Reuters Agency) – The Washington Post today published an article criticizing Laval's return to power in Vichy, calling on the United States to recognize the de Gaulle faction as the "true government of true France." Laval's new position is now the subject of discussion in diplomatic circles. Many people feel that the hope of Vichy cooperating more closely with Germany has finally been shattered, and the United States' continued policy of sympathy towards Vichy is also useless, so the time for a "clear break" has now arrived. At the same time, as of this evening, the US State Department has not received any information from Vichy regarding the French cabinet reorganization. However, recalling the US government's past uncoordinated attitude towards Tonval, it is expected that Vichy will adopt a policy of seeking isolation. The rejection of the memorandum submitted by Washington yesterday regarding the US policy towards the Free French authorities is a clear indication. It is questionable whether US officials still trust Vichy's repeated assurances of maintaining neutrality and faithfully abiding by the terms of the armistice. The recent developments in Franco-American relations have shocked those who are usually well-informed, as they all believed that as long as Darlan was in the French government, he would never allow Laval to make a comeback.

### Roosevelt's Silent Attitude

Lisbon, 15th (Haitong Agency, Washington Dispatch) – President Roosevelt adopted a silent attitude at yesterday's intelligence meeting when a reporter asked about Laval's return to the French cabinet, saying only that comments could be sought from the State Department.

Washington, 15th (Reuters Agency) – As of late last night, the State Department had not received any news regarding the Vichy cabinet changes. Officials are very skeptical about whether the statements repeatedly announced by Vichy in the past regarding its neutral policy and its promise to faithfully fulfill the provisions of the armistice agreement can be trusted. Although it is known that the Vichy government may take actions under the current circumstances that will force the United States to sever ties with Vichy, it is still believed here that the United States does not intend to take the initiative to break off relations with Vichy. Well-informed sources originally believed that Laval would not be in power as long as Darlan was in office. Therefore, well-informed sources were greatly shocked after learning the news of Laval's return to power. It is heard that once the United States breaks off relations with Vichy, some of the Vichy personnel in the United States still intend to stay in the United States.

### US Protest Note Rejected by Vichy; US House of Representatives Seeks to Occupy French Territories and Cooperate Closely with the de Gaulle Faction

Vichy, 14th (Havas Agency) – Regarding the US government's establishment of a consulate general in Brazzaville, the center of the de Gaulle faction in French Equatorial Africa, the French government had protested to the US authorities. The US reply has also been delivered. The French government therefore instructed its ambassador to the United States, Henry Haye, today to declare to the United States that the French government found it difficult to accept this reply. Regarding this matter, the French semi-official side recently issued a statement stating, "Regarding the US government's establishment of a consulate general in Brazzaville, after we protested to the United States, our ambassador to the United States, Henry Haye, received a reply from the US State Department on April 13 and immediately forwarded it to the government. After reviewing the content of this reply, not only are the words arrogant, but its purpose is to reduce the value of the patriotic activities of our loyal citizens. Our government immediately instructed Ambassador Henry Haye to notify the US Secretary of State, informing him that the French government found it difficult to accept this reply. The French people know how to love their country, and there is no need for outsiders to teach them. In addition, there is one point that the French government cannot but solemnly declare, that is, the US government's immediate publication of this reply, in violation of diplomatic norms, clearly shows that it contains propaganda purposes. As for the questions raised in the French note, the American reply does not contain a single word of response."

Berlin, 15th (Haitong Agency) – Yesterday, the German Foreign Ministry commented on the US reply to the French government's protest against the US establishment of a consulate in Brazzaville, French Equatorial Africa, stating that US Undersecretary of State Welles stated in his reply that the US move was for the benefit of the French. However, when Welles toured Europe in 1940, he fully revealed his lack of understanding of European events. Welles still believes that the fate of the French nation can be controlled by Washington.

Stockholm, 15th (Haitong Agency) – According to news from Washington, the US House of Representatives has requested the government to occupy French territories because they occupy an important strategic position for the United States. The House of Representatives also requested the government to cooperate closely with the de Gaulle faction. It is believed that the House's attitude is a direct result of the French government's reorganization.

### US Dispatches One Hundred Small Warships to Patrol the Atlantic Coast

### India Special Issue: Two Races and Their Religions

Shanghai people call Indians "Indian Blackies," which is really quite clever. Being clever doesn't necessarily mean being correct. The reason it's said to be clever is because it could be considered right, or it could be considered wrong. What's the mystery in all this? Readers, don't be impatient; listen as I slowly explain it to you.

Everyone knows that India is an ancient country. But just how ancient is it? It's enough to make people gasp. According to anthropological scholars, the Indian continent is the birthplace of humanity! Based on the theory of Professor A. H. Keane, the earliest human forms were most similar to today's Black people, and their region of origin was the so-called India-Australia region, which was a continent connecting Australia and Africa from a certain point in India. Later, when the continent sank and was separated by the Indian Ocean, humans retreated westward into Africa, advanced northeastward into India and the Malay Archipelago, and retreated southward into Australia. This is how humans spread out. Therefore, the Black people living in Africa and India, called Negritos, are the most primitive and infantile of the Black race. It is said that the Mincopie tribe, a kind of short-statured aborigines on the Andaman Islands in the Bay of Bengal, is a representative of the original Black people. According to this, wouldn't the earliest race in India be the truly authentic, original "Blackies"? So it's not entirely unreasonable for Shanghai people to call Indians "Indian Blackies." However, the only real "Blackies" are these original Indian Black people; the rest are not, and some are even "White Coal." The race that is currently most influential in India and represents it is the "White Coal," the Indo-Aryan race, which is the same as Europeans.

The "Blackies" were the original pioneers who opened up India. Next to go to India were the Dravidians. They passed through Punjab and entered central India, putting pressure on the original inhabitants and forcing them to move to southern India. The descendants of these Dravidians are the current Tamil, Telugu, and Kannada peoples, etc. The next to migrate to India were the Indo-Aryan people, who were tall and fair-skinned like Europeans. They left their original homeland in Central Asia, crossed the Hindu Kush mountains, and settled in northwestern India. The word "Aryan," when translated into Sanskrit, is usually translated as "holy," meaning noble. Originally, because these people were tall, fair-skinned, intelligent, and brave, and more superior to the earlier inhabitants of India, they inevitably became self-important. The Aryan people first settled in the Punjab region, engaged in animal husbandry, and gradually expanded their power to the southeast, entering the Ganges River basin. They drove the original Dravidian people to the south and gradually gained power, becoming the main body of the Indian people, which remains unchanged to this day. Among the Indians in Shanghai, there may be descendants of the Negritos, but they are ultimately mostly descendants of the Aryans, in which case calling Indians "Blackies" is incorrect.

Although the Indo-Aryans became the representative race of India, many other races migrated to India in large groups after them. From the West came the Greeks of Bactria, who crossed the Hindu Kush mountains and settled in the Gandhara and Punjab regions. Also, due to transportation and political relations, the Persians of the west also had some interactions with India. From the East came the Yuezhi and Saka peoples, who originally lived in western China. The Yuezhi people produced a king, Kanishka, who conquered the northern half of India and established the great Kushan dynasty, which was a prominent power at home and abroad. This is a major event in Indian history. However, these races were not able to sweep across the entire India like the Aryans; their invasions were limited to northwestern India. There were also Mongoloid peoples who invaded India from the northeastern route of the Himalayas. It is said that the current Bengalis are descendants of Mongoloids and Dravidians. As for going to India by sea, that was a relatively late development. The Jews and Arabs came relatively later, and it was not until the end of the fifteenth century that Europeans landed in India, followed by a continuous stream, even turning India into a dependency of Britain.

Today, India has a population of about 330 to 340 million, composed of many races and also many complex mixed races. Therefore, in terms of the national content that makes up the country, whether viewed from a racial or historical perspective, the country of India is extremely complex, which naturally has a direct impact on the overall culture and social organization, making them also complex. However, the center of the Indian nation, the main body of the Indian national society, is neither the earliest Black people nor the later Greeks, Persians, Arabs, Yuezhi, Saka, etc., but the Indo-Aryan people. Therefore, when discussing all issues related to India, as long as one grasps the Aryans, one grasps the core of the racial aspect of India.

Indian people, when they meet strangers, do not ask where you are from but ask what religion you belong to. This shows the deep relationship between India and religion. The most important caste system in Indian society, although said to have existed since the creation of the world, is actually inseparable from religious meaning. The earliest Brahmanical teachings of India claim that since the ancient Vedic period, although all are human, the Brahmins are said to have been born from the head of Brahma, the Kshatriyas from the shoulders of Brahma, the Vaishyas and Shudras from the legs and feet of Brahma. This is the origin of the myth of the four castes. The first caste, the Brahmins, is the priestly class that presides over sacrifices, wielding real power in religious matters. People of other castes sometimes even regard them as deities. The second caste, the Kshatriyas, is the class of kings and general aristocratic families who hold national power. They hold full political power and engage in military affairs, with the protection of the country and the people as their duty. The third caste, the Vaishyas, is the commoner class engaged in agricultural, industrial, and commercial production, and they have the obligation to pay taxes to the state. The fourth caste, the Shudras, is the slave class, the lowest of the four castes, whose only occupation is to serve the three upper castes with their labor. The Brahmins believe that the division of these four castes is divinely ordained and cannot be changed. If it is disrupted, it would be rebelling against God's decree and causing social chaos. Although there were only these four castes at the beginning, they became more and more distinct and numerous, so that now there are as many as 2,300 or 2,400 castes in India!

In the fifth century BC, a new religion suddenly emerged from the Indo-Aryan people, who were swept by Brahmanism. This religion opposed the four-caste system and advocated breaking down classes. It was Buddhism, founded by Shakyamuni. Buddhism is the highest authority in thought and religion, and no further explanation is needed. However, this Buddhism, which originated in India, is now very weak in its place of origin, with only a little influence remaining in the northeastern border area of Tibet and southern Ceylon. Buddhism in India was squeezed out by Hinduism. Hinduism, simply put, is a new type of Brahmanism that emerged in the eighth century AD. They did not have the high intelligence and philosophy of the original Brahmins, and they sacrificed to many gods, said to be 330 million deities! In the fifteenth century, they also incorporated Islamic doctrines. To cater to the general populace, they even worshiped deities that represent the worship of reproductive organs. Although Hinduism is called a return to Brahmanism, it is actually a religious reversal. But Hinduism is precisely the religion welcomed by the Indian people. Thus, in India, it drove Buddhism out of the country and still holds the greatest religious power in India. According to German statistics on Indian religions, it is roughly as follows:

(Hinduism accounts for 68.5% of the total Indian population. Islam accounts for 12.7% of the total Indian population. Buddhism accounts for 4% of the total Indian population. Animism accounts for 3% of the total Indian population. Sikhism accounts for 1% of the total Indian population. Christianity accounts for 1.5% of the total Indian population. Other accounts for 0.3% of the total Indian population.)

From the above table, one can generally see how enormous the power of Hinduism is. The central and southern parts of the Indian peninsula are almost entirely within the sphere of Hinduism's influence. The northwestern Punjab and Sindh are havens for Muslims, but there are also separate Muslim areas in the lower reaches of Bengal. As for Sikhism, it is within the borders of Punjab, and animism is mixed in the middle of Hinduism on the peninsula.

Religion in India is also very relevant to its self-government issues. According to Indian nationalists, whether Hindu or Muslim, they advocate that religious differences should be permanent political divisions, which would further strengthen self-government.

### Partial Reorganization of the Australian Cabinet: Curtin Concurrently Holds the Position of Minister of Defense and Serves as Liaison with MacArthur

Canberra, 14th (Reuters) - The Australian cabinet today underwent a partial reorganization. Prime Minister Curtin will concurrently hold the position of Minister of Defense and be responsible for liaison between the government and General MacArthur, Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces in the Southwest Pacific. At the same time, Prime Minister Curtin will also be responsible for liaison between the Federal Government and the Australian representatives in the British War Cabinet and the Pacific War Council.

Lisbon, 14th (Allied News Agency) - According to a Reuters dispatch from Canberra, the Australian government has decided to establish a new Ministry of Defense. Prime Minister Curtin has taken office today, concurrently holding the position of Minister of Defense. The purpose of establishing the new Ministry of Defense is to facilitate liaison between MacArthur's anti-Axis Allied forces and the Australian government. In the future, high-level policies concerning the defense of Australia will be proposed by Curtin to the Australian War Cabinet. Prime Minister Curtin will also personally liaise with Australian representatives attending the London War Cabinet and the Washington Pacific Conference, handling external negotiations.

MacArthur's Authority Questioned

Melbourne, 15th (Reuters) - A spokesman for the U.S. General Headquarters stated today that General MacArthur has not yet officially taken office as Supreme Commander of the Southwest Pacific, and currently only commands U.S. forces in the Far East, while his headquarters has been moved to Australia. President Roosevelt, while receiving reporters in Washington, emphasized that MacArthur commands the sea, land, and air forces of the Allied nations in the Southwest Pacific theater, but President Roosevelt declined to provide details about the boundaries of this theater. The Army spokesman could not provide further clarification, only stating that MacArthur is in close consultation with the Australian Army and government to formulate plans, while awaiting his official assumption of the position of Supreme Commander.

Canberra, 15th (Reuters) - Australian Prime Minister Curtin stated this afternoon at a reception for reporters that the Australian government considers General MacArthur to be the Supreme Commander of all Allied forces in the Southwest Pacific, with the authority to take any steps he deems appropriate. Curtin also stated that the Australian cabinet selected a new Australian ambassador to the United States during today's meeting, but will not announce the name of the new ambassador until an agreement is reached with the U.S. government.

Lisbon, 15th (News Agency) - President Roosevelt refused to clarify the authority of General MacArthur, Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces in the Southwest Pacific, during a press conference at the White House yesterday. It remains unclear to outsiders whether the New Zealand and Hawaiian U.S. forces are under MacArthur's command. However, Roosevelt only replied that MacArthur can command the land, sea, and air forces of the Allied nations in the Southwest Pacific.

Stockholm, 15th (Haitong News Agency) - The "New York Daily News" has called for the appointment of General MacArthur as the U.S. Secretary of War, as MacArthur's authority does not include the forces of New Zealand, and it is not clearly stipulated whether Admiral Nimitz of Hawaii is under his command. Therefore, MacArthur should be given the opportunity to fully develop his military talents for Washington to win this war. The current Secretary of War, Stimson, is an old officer whose prestige cannot be compared with MacArthur. In addition, the appointment of MacArthur as Secretary of War would increase the American people's determination to fight.

Washington, 14th (News Agency) - Yesterday was the 52nd anniversary of the Pan-American Conference. The 21 countries of North and South America celebrated the occasion.

The red-clad troops representing the enemy forces landed 100 kilometers from the Brazilian capital, attempting to capture it, with tanks, destroyers, and bombers providing cover. The defending troops, clad in green, engaged them in battle. The fire brigade was engaged in air defense work.

Lisbon, 15th (Haitong News Agency) - A dispatch from Mexico City states that the total number of regular troops in the South American countries is 388,000. Brazil alone has 250,000 regular troops and 300,000 reservists. Argentina has 80,000 regular troops.

### British Chancellor of the Exchequer Reads New Budget in the House of Commons: Total Expenditure Increases by 500 Million Pounds; Major Increase in Various Consumption Taxes

London, 15th (Reuters) - Chancellor of the Exchequer Wood presented the budget for 1942-43 in the House of Commons yesterday. The total expenditure is approximately £5,286,000,000, an increase of £510,000,000 over the previous year. Tax revenues are expected to exceed £6,500,000,000. The shortfall will be mainly filled by increasing taxes on tobacco, alcohol, and entertainment. Luxury goods such as silk fabrics, leather coats, hair curlers, jewelry, various musical instruments (except radios), and cosmetics will also see a doubling of the purchase tax, which will be equal to two-thirds of the wholesale price. Taxes on tobacco and alcohol will increase by one-third. It is estimated that Britain's beer consumption last year totaled approximately £330,000,000. This beer tax will increase by an average of one penny per pint. Various alcohol taxes will increase by one shilling and eight pence per bottle. Taxes on light wines were originally eight shillings per gallon for foreign goods and six shillings per gallon for domestic goods; each will increase by six shillings. Taxes on fortified wines or sweet wines were originally sixteen shillings per gallon for foreign goods and twelve shillings per gallon for domestic goods; each will increase by twelve shillings. The new tax rules will be implemented starting Wednesday. They are expected to generate £20,000,000 within the year. After the increase in tobacco tax, a pack of ten cigarettes originally selling for nine pence will increase to one shilling. Annual tobacco consumption totals approximately £340,000,000. National cinema ticket revenue is estimated at £1,400,000,000 annually. Entertainment tax will be doubled for tickets priced above seven pence. For example, a ticket priced at nine pence will see the entertainment tax increase to two and a half pence. Ringside seats at boxing matches cost 42 shillings per seat, and the entertainment tax will increase to 21 shillings and two pence. In this way, alcohol taxes can increase by £15,000,000, tobacco taxes can increase by £90,000,000, entertainment taxes can increase by £158,000,000, and luxury goods taxes can increase by £10,000,000. However, tobacco for the wounded and soldiers will still be priced at the original price. As for income taxes, there will be no reduction, but wage income taxes will be adjusted. Before the war, wage income taxes were paid by 1,000,000 people, totaling £25,000,000. In the last fiscal year, 5,500,000 people paid taxes totaling £125,000,000. Sir Kingsley Wood read the budget for 137 minutes. After reading, the entire House applauded him.

London, 15th (Havas) - Chancellor of the Exchequer Wood stated in the House of Commons yesterday when presenting the budget that, as of February this year, the aid provided by the United States to the Allied countries under the Lend-Lease Act has totaled approximately 26 billion U.S. dollars.

### U.S. Congress Prepares to Introduce Bills to Address Inflation

Washington, 14th (Havas) - The United States is currently facing the crisis of inflation. Congress is preparing to introduce several bills to address the issue. However, most financial experts are not yet fully aware of the actual situation of increased currency issuance and rising prices. Since the United States entered the war, the cost of living has increased by 15%. It is expected to increase by at least 23% by the end of this year. In this case, the government budget will be turbulent, and the war preparation production plan will be overturned. The U.S. government has allocated more than 100 billion in military spending. If prices continue to rise, this amount will be insufficient. The House Appropriations Committee has received several proposals to prevent inflation. In summary, the proposed measures are approximately fivefold: 1. Implement tax increases; 2. Control wages; 3. Limit wartime profits; 4. Restrict lending facilities; 5. Expand price controls. Let's discuss them separately. First, regarding the tax increase, there are many difficulties. Since the beginning of the war, the burden on U.S. taxpayers has already been very heavy. The total tax revenue for this year is estimated to be approximately 125 billion. Some government officials plan to increase it by another 80 billion, but others still consider it insufficient. It is said that to have a good forecast, the tax revenue item should be listed as 250 billion. In addition to increasing taxes, the government also plans to implement compulsory savings, requiring taxpayers to purchase national defense bonds based on their salaries, which will be repaid after the war. However, this has not been fully decided. Second, regarding the control of wages, although this measure is an effective way to prevent the high cost of living, it will inevitably cause social problems. Recently, union leaders have agreed to abolish double pay for overtime work. To compensate for the sacrifices of the working class, the government may enact laws to stipulate the maximum salary for all classes across the country. According to sources in the transportation sector, based on this principle, U.S. citizens should not earn more than 50,000 per year during the war. If implemented, it would be a major way to appease dissatisfaction in the labor community. Third, regarding the limitation of wartime profits, this bill is currently under discussion in Congress. The maximum limit is said to be set at 6%. Some government officials even want to order military factories to return previous excess profits to the government. Whether this can be realized remains to be seen. Fourth, regarding the restriction of lending, the first step is to prohibit "installment payment" transactions. This method is very common in the United States, but according to economists, it is a major cause of the increased cost of living in the United States. Fifth, regarding price controls, it is generally supported by the public and is currently being studied by President Roosevelt himself. Recommendations are expected to be submitted to Congress soon. Henderson, Director of the U.S. Office of Price Administration, has had the power to "freeze" the prices of certain goods since the outbreak of the war. In the future, this power may be extended to many more commodities.

### First Blackout Implemented in Washington, D.C.

Washington, 15th (Reuters) - Washington, D.C., implemented its first citywide blackout last night, giving 75,000 police officers, firefighters, and civil defense personnel their first large-scale test. Passengers on buses and streetcars all left the vehicles and took shelter in nearby buildings.

### East Line Ice and Snow Thaw, Battlefield Muddy, Offense and Defense in a Stalemated State, Intense Fighting Still Occurring Where Roads Are Firm

Berlin, April 15th, Huitong News Agency: Today's German military report stated that the enemy's offensive on the Eastern Front has weakened compared to before. Only a few areas with slightly stronger forces were repelled. Our army's counterattacks were victorious. German artillery bombarded facilities in Leningrad, with factories being a primary target. The sound of explosions was loud, and the fire illuminated the sky. German fighter squadrons bombarded port facilities and airfields in Sevastopol.

Berlin, April 15th, Huitong News Agency: The ice and snow on the Eastern Front have begun to thaw, and the vast battlefield is nothing but a muddy swamp. Therefore, no large-scale battles have occurred in recent days. The Soviet army's offensive activities have also sharply decreased, with only more intense battles unfolding where the roads are relatively firm, such as in the areas west of Moscow, including Yukhnov and Medyn. The Soviet army repeatedly attacked German positions, but all were repelled by the German army. In several northern areas, Soviet troops also launched attacks, briefly penetrating the German lines, but were driven out by German counterattacks. The southern section of the Eastern Front is relatively quiet, with nothing worth mentioning.

Berlin, April 14th, Havas: The German News Agency recently issued a message stating that the weather on the Eastern Front is harsh, affecting both the offensive and defensive sides. In addition, as the spring season arrives, the autumn thaw is occurring, roads are muddy, and highways are unusable. Soldiers work day and night to maintain important transportation. Despite the difficulties, the German army is still able to maintain normal connections, thanks to the efforts of special transportation teams. In short, due to the bad weather on the Eastern Front, the fighting has stopped and is in a state of stalemate.

Berlin, April 14th, Havas: The German News Agency recently announced that in recent days, the Red Army has repeatedly attacked the German division's positions in the Yukhnov area. On April 12th, under the cover of artillery fire, the Red Army launched as many as fourteen successive attacks, all of which failed.

Stockholm, Sweden, April 14th, Havas: This agency's special correspondent reports that neutral observers believe that the situation on the German-Soviet front line is becoming increasingly chaotic, especially in the Donets River basin. The battle for Bryansk on the Desna River is currently raging. Although the Red Army claims to have safely crossed the river, the city is already encircled. The German army claims that the enemy has been blocked on the east bank of the river, suffering heavy losses and retreating. Furthermore, regarding the Kharkov front, the situation is also very ambiguous. Although the Red Army claims to have recaptured Belgorod, the official communique has not confirmed this claim. The Red Army today still claims to have broken through the German lines between Belgorod and Kharkov, directly attacking the vicinity of Zachepylivka, a town 25 miles west of Kharkov. If this is true, then the railway lines from Kharkov to the north and northwest have likely been cut off.

Berlin, April 15th, Huitong News Agency: The German High Command announced yesterday afternoon that German fighter squadrons heavily attacked a certain port on the Black Sea coast on Monday. Although Soviet aircraft attempted to intercept them, the German aircraft still reached the target and dropped bombs like rain on the port facilities, causing several large fires. A 5,000-ton Soviet oil tanker also caught fire after being hit.

Moscow, April 15th: To obtain additional funds for conducting the war, the Soviet People's Commissariat has decided to issue 100 billion rubles in national military bonds, with a term of twenty years. The 1942 national military bonds are divided into two types: lottery bonds and interest-bearing bonds. The tickets for the lottery bonds are repaid with all the income from the lottery. The tickets for the interest-bearing bonds pay interest on schedule. Over the twenty years, the lottery bonds will be drawn forty times, that is, twice a year.

### Cripps Arrives in Cairo Yesterday

Cairo, April 15th, Reuters: Sir Stafford Cripps arrived here today and is staying at the British Embassy in Egypt.

Berlin, April 15th, Huitong News Agency: The German Foreign Ministry believes that Cripps' failure in India is a symbol of the end of the British era. If Cripps does not succeed in his mission, it will be a major blow to the justice of the Axis powers' war. The simplicity of the British is astounding; they still believe that India can be deceived as easily as it was during the First World War. However, Britain's second attempt has now proven its failure. Britain boasted that "India is the heart of the British Empire," but today India has become a wart of the British Empire. Although India has not yet reached its goal, it is moving towards it. Therefore, the calls of Bose, the leader of the Indian National Congress, will attract more attention than in the past.

Bose Broadcasts in Germany

Berlin, April 15th, Havas: Prominent Indian leader Bose recently delivered a radio address here, stating that India is about to regain its freedom. He briefly said that the situation in the Far Eastern war is clear at a glance, that is, Britain is about to surrender. The claim of the British Empire's naval superiority is nothing more than a myth. The Japanese navy's victory in the Indian Ocean has achieved an irresistible advantage. Every patriotic person should seize the opportunity to fight for India's freedom and contact the enemies of British imperialism. Germany, Italy, and Japan are our friendly nations. Indian independence is not far off.

### Marshall Advocates Launching a Blitzkrieg Offensive in Europe, American Military Strategist Publishes Article Discussing Invasion Locations

Stockholm, Sweden, April 14th, Havas: The Berlin correspondent of the Geneva Daily News reports, according to sources on the German-Swiss border, that US Army Chief of Staff General Marshall, currently in London, is strongly urging the British General Staff to accept President Roosevelt's plan for an immediate invasion of continental Europe. The US believes that Germany has stationed only a small number of troops in Western Europe and that the people in the occupied areas are mostly inclined towards the Allied powers. British troops and the American Expeditionary Force can easily achieve success by launching a blitzkrieg offensive from the British mainland. Therefore, the US believes that this military action, even if it cannot be launched immediately, should be implemented as soon as possible. However, the German side is well aware of this plan and does not consider it to be a serious threat. They also do not believe that Britain will accept it, as the British know that implementing the US plan would only result in heavy sacrifices. For Germany, its main task is on the Eastern Front, and it will continue to devote its efforts to it and will not allow others to interfere.

Lisbon, April 15th, Huitong News Agency: A military commentator for the New York National Broadcasting Company published an article in the American Observer magazine discussing the possibility of an Allied invasion of continental Europe. He stated that to defeat Germany, an invasion of the mainland is unavoidable. After conducting a detailed review of the military prerequisites for this plan, he also raised the issue of the location for implementing this plan. In addition to Norway and Brittany, he also mentioned neutral Spain. The Middle East is also within the plan, but Turkey's participation in the war is an important factor. Berlin, April 14th, Havas: According to official information received here, the Soviet Ambassador to Britain, Maisky, recently delivered a note from his government to the British and American governments, requesting that those countries provide prompt and full assistance to the Soviet Union and urging the British and American authorities to further understand the Soviet Union's actual situation and its military achievements. It stated that the Soviet Union's internal affairs have often been deliberately distorted by the outside world in the past twenty years, and that because of these inaccurate rumors, the Soviet Union has been isolated in the world, especially from Britain. Walls of misunderstanding and suspicion have surrounded us. Full cooperation between the Soviet Union and the Anglo-Saxons during and after the war cannot succeed unless this wall is first destroyed. German officials commented on this note, stating that the Soviet authorities are trying to quickly establish a spring offensive plan, and their increasing nervousness can be seen in this note. At this point, the Soviet Union has realized its isolation and helplessness. British Prime Minister Churchill's speech in the House of Commons yesterday, stating that Britain does not intend to take any futile military actions, will only increase the Soviet Union's anxiety.

### Marshall and Others Call on the British King Yesterday and Meet with the Polish Commander-in-Chief

London, April 15th, Reuters: US Army Chief of Staff General Marshall had a long talk today with Polish Prime Minister and Commander-in-Chief General Sikorski. In addition to discussing the status of the Polish army in Britain, the East, and the Soviet Union, they also discussed the military situation in Europe, especially in the Soviet Union.

### Ceylon Island's Posture Under Dense War Clouds

Judging from the war news on the newspapers, unless there are local offensive and defensive battles on the Bataan Peninsula of Luzon Island in the Pacific War, land military operations seem to have temporarily come to a halt; generally, it is speculated that the future direction of the Japanese army's actions will be India and Australia. The implementation of various precautions in India and Australia shows the urgency of the situation.

On the Australian side, the Japanese army has already landed on New Guinea Island north of the Australian mainland, aiming to capture Port Moresby, so that it can be used as a base to attack Australia from nearby. Therefore, New Guinea can be said to be the outpost of Australia, and its gains and losses have a great impact on Australia itself. On the Indian side, there is also an outpost similar to New Guinea for Australia, which is Ceylon Island. Ceylon Island and the Indian continent are only separated by the Palk Strait, just as New Guinea and Australia are only separated by the Torres Strait. Ceylon Island is now a direct colony of the British Empire, and its capital Colombo has recently been bombed for the first time by Japanese naval aircraft. Judging from past examples, air raids are often the prelude to military attacks, so Ceylon Island has attracted the world's attention in recent days.

Considering the topography of Ceylon Island, it is roughly similar to a pear, with the pear tip facing north. The total area of the island is 25,332 square miles, which is slightly smaller than two-thirds of Zhejiang Province in China. The north is separated from India by the Gulf of Mannar and the Palk Strait. The temperature on the island varies with the altitude. The highest places are Pidurutalagala (8,296 feet) and Adam's Peak (7,352 feet). However, as a whole, although Ceylon Island is located in the tropics, the climate, except in the low-lying areas, does not hinder health. The weather is coolest in December and January, and hottest in April and May.

Ceylon Island had various names in ancient times, such as the ancient Greeks and Romans called it Taprobane. Later, Western and Eastern people wrote books and called it Serendib, Sirindul, and Zeylan, etc. The earliest inhabitants of Ceylon Island were perhaps the ancestors of the Vedda people, a primitive small tribe who lived by hunting and currently reside in the eastern forests. People have found ancient stone tools in the caves inhabited by the Vedda people, indicating that they have lived on the island for an unknown number of years.

The famous ancient Indian epic "Ramayana" contains the story of the ancient Indian hero Rama and his followers conquering part of Ceylon Island and occupying the capital of Ceylon Island's king, Ravana. Whether this story is based on facts is unknown, but if it happened, the occupation did not last long. The reliable history of Ceylon Island that people can trace back to begins in 543 BC, when Vijaya, the founder of the Sinhala dynasty, led a team from the Indian continent and landed on Ceylon Island, introducing a higher civilization to Ceylon. He was especially skilled in cultivation. The oldest large reservoir for irrigating fields near Anuradhapura was built by Vijaya's successor around 504 BC. At the beginning of the third century BC, Prince Ashoka sent people to Ceylon Island to spread Buddhism, which was believed by the residents of the entire island. Later, the Tamil people from the Malabar coast of western India invaded Ceylon and often ruled it, but in 1071 AD, the Sinhala king Meng restored the throne.

In 1408 (the sixth year of the Yongle reign of Emperor Chengzu of the Ming Dynasty), China sent troops to conquer the Sinhala dynasty due to being insulted during an envoy to Ceylon. They attacked Ceylon and captured King Vijayabahu IV. For the next thirty years, the Sinhala king paid tribute to China every year.

In 1505, the Portuguese Almeida arrived in Ceylon and saw that the island had been divided into seven kingdoms. Eleven years later, the governor of the Goa region on the west coast of India ordered the construction of a fortress in Colombo. From then until the rise of the Dutch in the seventeenth century, the Portuguese devoted themselves to establishing their rule in Ceylon, repeatedly fighting with the local chieftains and Arabs on the island, and achieving considerable victories. In 1638, the Dutch army expeditioned to Ceylon and destroyed the Portuguese fortresses on the east coast. By 1658, the Portuguese were finally expelled from their last stronghold in Ceylon Island, Jaffna. In 1795, the British broke off relations and sent troops to occupy Ceylon. In 1803, the Treaty of Amiens was signed, formally ceding this Dutch colony to Britain. On March 2, 1815, Britain signed a treaty with the Kandyan chiefs of Ceylon Island, declaring that the entire sovereignty of the island belonged to the British King.

The population of Ceylon Island is now less than six million people. The Sinhalese account for about seven-tenths, and most of the rest are Tamils. There are also many other ethnic groups, the largest of which are the Moor people of Arab descent who believe in Islam.

Ceylon Island is mainly agricultural, with rice, which is mainly consumed by the island itself, being the most important product. In addition, it also produces coconuts, graphite, cocoa, cinnamon, lemon oil, nutmeg, betel nuts, and tobacco. Ceylon Island also has many gemstones, the most important of which are rubies and sapphires. Pearls can also be harvested in the Gulf of Mannar.

The capital Colombo is quite prosperous and is known as the fifth largest city in the world, with a population of about 300,000. The Colombo Museum has magnificent buildings and contains a large number of ancient artifacts and specimens, such as ancient Portuguese and Dutch furniture, Sinhala jewelry, ivory carvings, handwritten books, and bronzes. Victoria Park, the Asokaramaya Buddhist temple, Hindu temples, relics from the Portuguese occupation, ancient Dutch churches and cemeteries, and the Betah land owner's Islamic hall are all famous places.

Ceylon's Holy Mountain

Adam's Peak is the holy mountain of Ceylon. Although this mountain is only 7,300 feet high, because there is a giant's footprint on the top of the mountain, everyone regards it as a very sacred place. This "footprint" is about two yards long, and believers of various religions say that the footprint was left by the giant god they believe in. It is said that this holy mountain has been revered by the people of Ceylon for two thousand years.

### HSBC Bank Begins Third Round of Withdrawals, Paying Out 25% of Balance, Mercantile Bank to Begin Next Monday

The English-language "Ta Mei Wan Pao" reports that it has learned today (April 15th) that two major British banks in Shanghai are paying out another batch of deposits to all depositors, including Allied depositors. One is HSBC Bank, which is starting this morning to pay out another 25% of the original deposit balance as of December 6th of last year to each depositor. Mercantile Bank will begin paying out 30% of the original balance as of December 6th of last year from April 20th, which is next Monday. It is also heard that Citibank will also pay out another batch of deposits in the near future, with the date possibly within next week, but the exact date has not yet been decided.

Total Amount of Withdrawals for Large and Small Depositors

This is the third batch of deposits to be paid out since the outbreak of the Pacific War on December 8th. For HSBC Bank, it is now paying out another 25% of the total amount of deposits, which is half of the frozen deposit balance. When Shanghai was occupied by the Japanese army, half of all deposits were transferred to Yokohama Specie Bank, and the remaining balance was frozen. Subsequently, 15% of it was paid out, so after today's additional 25% payment, small depositors have actually withdrawn 80% of the total amount of their deposit balance as of December 6th of last year. The amount of withdrawals for large depositors ranges from 75% to 80%. According to an HSBC employee, the reason for the difference in the percentage of deposits withdrawn by large and small depositors is that after the outbreak of the war, each depositor was paid 2,000 yuan as quickly as possible. The purpose of paying out 2,000 yuan in deposits was to assist small depositors, so it can be seen that the smaller the deposit, the higher the percentage of deposits withdrawn.

Mercantile's Three Withdrawal Periods

As for Mercantile Bank, it will also begin paying out the third batch of deposits from Monday, which is 30% of the deposit balance as of December 6th of last year after deducting 2,000 yuan. The total percentage of withdrawals before and after is 80% of the original balance. Mercantile Bank paid out the first batch of deposits of 2,000 yuan on January 17th of this year, and the second batch of 50% was paid out starting from January 19th. The remaining balance was transferred to Mitsui Bank, but transactions related to these balances are still handled by Mercantile Bank. The following deposits are still temporarily frozen: (A) Deposits of Chinese people exceeding 100 yuan, pending a decision by the Japanese authorities on the value of the deposits. (B) Deposits of depositors indebted to the bank, pending their debts being cleared. There are no restrictions on the deposits of people from non-belligerent countries. As for the remaining deposits, which are approximately 25% of the original balance, it is expected that they will eventually be paid out in one or more batches. Mercantile Bank is not currently making payments.

### Anti-Epidemic Campaign Begins in This City, More Than 40,000 People Vaccinated in Two Days

Since the health authorities of this city launched the anti-epidemic campaign on Monday (April 13th), more than 40,000 people have been vaccinated against cholera for free in the first two days. This vaccination campaign is being carried out simultaneously in the two concessions and the Chinese area. The Japanese authorities in this city have also adopted mandatory measures to implement vaccinations to prevent the occurrence of cholera. The Japanese military authorities are requiring vaccinations at all bridges over the Suzhou Creek. Nearly 6,000 people have been vaccinated on the 13th and 14th. At the same time, the health offices set up by the Public Concession and the French Concession have also been busy vaccinating residents gathered there for several days. In addition, the mobile teams of the health offices of the two concessions have also been going to various businesses to carry out collective vaccinations against cholera. According to a spokesman for the Public Works Department, cholera vaccinations in the Public Concession are free of charge, and anti-epidemic certificates applicable to this city can also be obtained free of charge. It is said that the anti-epidemic certificates issued by the Public Works Department are also recognized by the Japanese military authorities, so this certificate is also valid when passing over the bridges on the Suzhou Creek. However, the Health Department of the Bureau charges 10 yuan in Reserve Certificates for issuing special anti-epidemic certificates to people leaving Shanghai. As for those who hire doctors to get vaccinated, if they need proof, the doctor must first send a letter to the Health Department to obtain it and pay a fee of 5 yuan in Reserve Certificates. The vaccinations at the health offices of the two concessions are not limited in time, while the Japanese authorities' vaccinations on the Suzhou Creek bridges are scheduled to end on the 28th of this month.

### Japanese Military Spokesman Discusses Requisitioning Cars, Those Suitable for Military Use Will Be Confiscated, Limited to Nationals of Belligerent Countries

The English-language "Ta Mei Wan Pao" reports that Lieutenant Matsuda, assistant spokesman for the Japanese Army, expressed the Japanese Army authorities' gratitude for the cooperation of various enemy nationals with the Japanese side's announcement on requisitioning cars from enemy nationals in Shanghai at a press conference yesterday (April 14th). It is said that as of 3:00 PM on Tuesday, enemy nationals had turned in approximately 300 cars. The announcement stipulated that cars must be turned in on April 13th, 14th, and 15th, so today (April 15th) is the deadline. The Japanese authorities have received approximately eight-tenths of the cars registered by enemy nationals. Those that are suitable for military use will be confiscated. However, the Japanese authorities will take an extremely lenient attitude towards the remaining cars and are currently studying methods. The announcement stated that the names of the areas where enemy nationals must turn in their cars were omitted and did not mention the Western District, that is, the Hongqiao District is also included. As for Indians and Filipinos, they should also turn in their cars to assist the Japanese authorities in conducting investigations.

Other British and American nationals who are about to be evacuated are expected to arrive here successively as shipping permits. A total of twenty-seven people arrived from Yantai, arriving in Shanghai earlier than originally expected. This group includes fourteen British nationals and thirteen American nationals, led by British Consul in Yantai, Budett, and American Consul, Roberts, respectively. Among the British nationals are six men, three women, and four children. Among the American nationals are eight men and seven women. Some have checked into the International Hotel, while others are staying at the Huamei Hotel. Among them are former customs officers, missionaries, and several bankers. All must remain in Shanghai until next month when they will begin their evacuation.

### Factories and Institutions May Apply for Rice

The Shanghai Municipal Council has issued a notice regarding applications for rice supply for factories and offices, stating: "It is hereby notified that factories and offices operating in the Public Concession that manufacture essential goods and employ at least 30 permanent Chinese employees may now apply directly for rice supply at Room 701, General Office of this Bureau, No. 209 Hankou Road. All applications must be accompanied by a list stating the number of employees, the amount of rice currently in stock and required, and must be certified as accurate by a recognized accountant. This notice is hereby issued for general information."

### Roadside Markers Erected to Indicate High Tide Levels

In order to prevent high tides during the autumn flood season this year, the Shanghai Municipal Council Public Works Department, in addition to dredging underground sewers where necessary and appropriately raising low-lying road surfaces, has recently erected concrete tide level marker posts on the steps of important roads prone to high tide flooding, such as Nanjing Road, Zhejiang Road, Zhibu Road, and west Guizhou Road. These markers indicate tide heights from 13 feet to 16 feet 5 inches above the lowest tide level, for identification purposes.

### Dispute Over Payment, False Accusation Against Younger Brother

Wei Chi Zhao Shan (also known as Bao Qing), the owner of the Yunnan Road Hankou Guansheng Canned Food Company, previously accused Wei Chi Zhao Jia (also known as Li Ting), the manager of the company and his younger brother, at the French Concession police station, of embezzlement, taking canned goods from the warehouse and selling them to Kaiyuan Food Company, a total of 350 boxes. After detailed investigation by detectives, it has been determined that the defendant sold these goods with the prior consent of his elder brother, the plaintiff, first selling them to Zheng Ming Ji, who resold them to Xiao Hecheng Confectionery on Baliqiao Street, and then to Yuan at No. 17, Laozha Road. The goods were sold and purchased according to market prices, with no intentional receiving of stolen goods. The case originates from a dispute between the brothers over payment and the desire to recover the goods for resale at a higher price due to soaring market prices. They maliciously accused Kaiyuan Company of receiving stolen goods. The police are now conducting a thorough investigation, and the plaintiff may face charges of false accusation.

### Fires in the Public Concession Last Month

In March of this year, the Shanghai Municipal Council Fire Brigade in the Public Concession received a total of sixty-three alarms, including fires burning garbage or similar items, nine false alarms, a malicious fire alarm, a chimney fire, and a special emergency alarm. The remaining forty-nine were actual fires. Property located in the Public Concession and the Western District that suffered losses due to fire is estimated to be worth approximately 555,818 yuan and 39,600 yuan, respectively, totaling approximately 595,418 yuan. Nine people died in the fires, including one who died in the fire and eight who died in bomb explosions. Eighteen civilians were injured (three due to fire and fifteen due to bomb explosions), as well as six fire brigade personnel. The brigade's ambulance responded 192 times last month, transporting 219 patients to hospitals.

### Haifu Steamer to Sail to Dinghai

Expected to Commence in Early May

Datong News Agency reports that while the procedures for the Haifu steamer to operate the Shanghai-Dinghai route are gradually being completed, there is still no confirmed date for its commencement. The Hana steamer's operation to Ningbo has not materialized. The following is noted:

Haifu to Sail to Dinghai, Expected Next Month

The Haifu steamer of the Lihe Shipping Department has now been restored to the name of the Chinese-owned Zhoushan Navigation Company and is scheduled to operate on the Shanghai-Dinghai route, also calling at Shenjiamen. The necessary procedures for its operation are gradually being completed, and job assignments have also been internally finalized. However, there is still no confirmed date for its commencement. According to speculation within the shipping industry, it is generally expected to commence in early May.

Hana to Sail to Ningbo, Has Not Materialized

After ceasing operations last year, the steamer has been berthed at the Dongjiadu pontoon on the Huangpu River. The ship has recently been repainted, and this has now been completed. The Hana steamer, moored near the steamer and owned by the German-owned Far East Company, has also been repainted. There was previously talk of the ship operating on the Shanghai-Ningbo route, but this has now subsided.

Moufuk Remains Detained; No Release News

The Moufuk steamer of the German-owned Lihe Foreign Firm, formerly known as the Ningshao steamer, was detained while en route to Wenzhou last year and is moored in Dinghai. There was talk of the steamer resuming its original name and operating on the Shanghai-Ningbo route, but this was abandoned because those in charge of the ship were not in Shanghai and no one was able to make a decision. Therefore, the steamer remains detained in Dinghai.

Limited Cabin Space on Shanghai-Ningbo Steamers

The steamers currently operating on the Shanghai-Ningbo route are all small in tonnage and have a limited passenger capacity, each only able to accommodate five or six hundred passengers. As many people are currently leaving Shanghai to return to their hometowns, purchasing tickets is quite difficult. Unless larger tonnage steamers are added to the route, passengers traveling between Shanghai and Ningbo will suffer great hardship.

### Many Leaving Shanghai for Ningbo; Ningbo's Market Conditions Flourish

Datong News Agency reports that due to the large number of people from Ningbo, Zhenhai, Cixi, and other places returning to their hometowns, the market conditions in Ningbo are more prosperous than before. Details are as follows:

Since last spring, due to changes in local conditions in Ningbo, most of the residents in the urban area moved their homes to other places, with only a small number of poor households remaining. Soon, as local order was restored, residents who had moved to other places returned one after another, and the market gradually flourished, and it has recently returned to its former state. The streets and alleys are filled with people, and public security has also been restored. The situation in the surrounding villages is similar.

Recently, the market in Zhenhai has recovered to its pre-incident state. According to people from the area, the bustling sections of the city are lined with shops, and the streets are crowded, a world of difference from the desolate scene six months ago. Recently, steamers sailing between Shanghai and Ningbo are also making frequent stops, making it easier for passengers to travel, and the urban population has increased several times.

The situation in the urban area of Cixi has been very good in recent months. The prices of daily necessities and food are roughly the same as before. The population has increased two to three times recently. However, there are many unemployed people, so there are a large number of people setting up stalls to run small businesses in the bustling areas. Many of the natives of Ningbo, Zhenhai, Cixi, Xiangshan, Fenghua, and other places who reside in this port have been returning to their hometowns due to the rising prices of goods in this city and the difficulty in purchasing rice and coal. However, since the direct steamers between Shanghai and Ningbo have temporarily stopped carrying passengers, most of those who urgently want to return to their hometowns are detouring through Dinghai, Shenjiamen, and other ports, and then taking sailboats to Zhenhai, or from Zhenhai to other places. It is said that although the journey takes many days, there are no difficulties.

### Gang of Thieves Cracked; Many Crimes Discovered

Song Bingzheng, a Chinese detective from the Cheng Du Road police station, along with detectives Sun Wenxi and Zhang Kuidong, and Japanese detective Mori Susumu, recently apprehended major thieves Zhu Shigen, Yu Guliang, Cao Kechang, Zhang Sanbao, Mao Binghe, Li Tubao, Lin Changzhen, and Zhou Abing at Room 254 of the Dongfang Hotel, No. 59, Lane 381, Wusong Road, and No. 16, Lane 83, Wuzhou Road. They also confiscated a box cannon, three handguns, and three lotus blossom handguns with more than forty bullets in them at No. 776, Renzhi Lane, North Sichuan Road. It was discovered that Zhu and the others had committed robberies, including stealing more than 30,000 yuan from the Huayi Candle Factory at No. 23, Lane 478, Tiantong Road, more than 10,000 yuan worth of property from the Yinghong Brothel at No. 18, Huile Lane, Fuzhou Road, more than 20,000 yuan worth of property from the owner of the Maochang Optical Company at No. 58, Lane 97, Mei Ge Road, and more than ten other robberies. Stolen goods, including jewelry and silver dollars worth more than 10,000 yuan, were seized and taken into custody for further investigation to determine whether they were involved in other crimes. Zhu Guisheng, a 58-year-old native of Nantong, robbed cigarettes from a rickshaw at the intersection of Kaizi Road and Belle Road on February 22 of this year because he was impoverished and starving. He was arrested and detained, but became ill during the investigation and died in the hospital despite treatment. Because he had no family, the body was buried by a charity.

Belle Road, Kangdi Road

Car and Tram Collide

At around 9:00 AM yesterday, a black-plate car with license number 752 was driving through the intersection of Belle Road and Kangdi Road in the French Concession when it collided with tramcar number 152 on route 17 of the French-owned Tram Company. The front of the car was severely damaged, and the tramcar also suffered some damage. Nanjing Road Wing On Company's 3.33% annual dividend for the 30th year has been converted into shares. Shareholders who converted their old shares into new shares have been issued temporary receipts by the company. It is now known that these receipts have been officially exchanged for stock certificates since the 15th of this month. Holders of these receipts are advised to take note.

### Rental Payments in New Currency; Renters Urge Rent Reduction

Recently, some landlords in the city have declared that they will collect rent in the new currency, and many have already implemented this policy. However, most tenants believe that paying rent in the new currency would be equivalent to increasing the original rent by 30%. At a time when the cost of living is high and it is already difficult to make ends meet, how can they bear to increase their expenses? Therefore, in recent days, residents and businesses in some alleys have been calling on landlords who collect rent in the new currency to reduce the original rent by 30%, so that paying in the new currency would be fair in reason and emotion. Otherwise, it would only add to the burden on the common people. It is also heard that the authorities are considering solutions to this issue.

### The Music Scene in Shanghai

Since spring, the music scene in Shanghai has indeed flourished. In the past month alone, there have been no fewer than ten public concerts. Moreover, with the drastic reduction in the source of films, a part of Shanghai people's interest has turned to music. At each concert, we can always find a group of Chinese audiences, which was rare in the past. They may be young music students, or just enthusiastic lovers, but they all have a kind of desire, a pursuit and understanding of advanced art. Under normal circumstances, we have to say that this is a good phenomenon.

Although Shanghai is an international metropolis, the music scene has always been very indifferent. For many years, the Shanghai Municipal Council Orchestra has been supporting this barren garden. They regularly perform at the Lyceum Theatre every Sunday afternoon at 5:00 PM. The conductor is the famous Italian musician Mario Paci. Almost all the members of this orchestra are foreigners. There are only three Chinese members, Chen Youxin, Ma Sicong, and Ma Sizhong. Most of them are of German, Italian, or Russian nationality. The first violinist is Professor Foa, who is also Italian. He has performed solos many times in the past. As for his superb skills and high cultivation, the audience should be familiar with this. At the beginning of March this year, the Shanghai Municipal Council Orchestra held two consecutive concerts commemorating the 150th anniversary of Mozart's death, and invited sixteen famous singers from the city to participate in the performance, which was a great success. Recently, the orchestra has invited pianists such as Wineia Tomaszewska and Susanne Decllety to cooperate and perform the works of masters such as Grieg, Schumann, and Vincentd'Indy. Because the orchestra is suitable for the level of Westerners, the standard is relatively high. It is difficult for Chinese audiences to understand without high cultivation.

In addition to the Shanghai Municipal Council Orchestra, other formal music organizations in the city include the Ejas Club, which regularly performs at the Jewish Community Center. This group has most of the city's famous singers. The conductor is the Russian Margolinski. Recently, a Schubert concert was held. In addition, the Russian Light Opera Troupe and the Russian Dance Troupe regularly perform at the Lyceum Theatre. The latter recently entered the Grand Theatre and performed programs such as "Poet Travels to Hell" and "Falling City". The troupe has more than 20 musicians, and the conductor is Sloutiky. The Chinese audience has a very good impression of its past performances.

Speaking of the formal organization of the Chinese music scene, we can't help but feel ashamed. We know very well that there is no shortage of musicians with high cultivation among the Chinese people, but it seems that there is no concrete organization. Until recently, Mr. Li Weining and the YMCA initiated a more sound and planned group, which injected a new stimulant into the silent air. Mr. Li Weining is the current acting president of the National Conservatory of Music. He is a student of Vincentd'Indy, a master of modern French music, and has an honorary title from the Vienna Conservatory of Music. He has a deep artistic attainments. In the first regular concert he initiated on the 4th of this month, he personally participated in the piano accompaniment. This was a solo recital by contralto Sabina Rapp, singing small pieces by Schubert, Hugo Wikf, Brahms, Wagner, Debussy, etc. Li's own works such as "Midnight", "First Meeting", and "Homesickness" were also sung. Except for the works of French writers, which were sung in French, all other works, including Li's works, were sung in German. Li's works, in terms of meaning and expression, are difficult to compare with other famous musicians, but Li's spirit of pioneering and bravery is admirable.

The concerts initiated by the YMCA have been held several times before, and famous singers such as Wu Zhengqian have performed on stage. The concert held last Saturday was mainly led by the Ma sisters, and soprano Chen Menglan participated in the cooperation. Ms. Chen sang lyrical short pieces this time, with piano accompaniment by Paci, the conductor of the Shanghai Municipal Council. Few people in Shanghai have this honor. Paci's own work "Dao", which he composed when he was a student at the Conservatory 40 years ago, was also sung on the same day. However, Ms. Chen's voice is still too narrow, and she cannot cope with high scales easily and lacks expression. The violin solo by Ma Sicong and the piano solo by Ms. Ma Sizhong are both above standard. All the pieces played that day were technically difficult, and it is absolutely difficult to play them without high cultivation. The last piece was "Dance Music" composed by his elder brother Ma Sitsong. This was created by Ma referring to the folk songs of Suiyuan and Sichuan during his travels, and adding various variations, with extremely beautiful and harmonious strings and a strong oriental sentiment. This kind of experimental work was unanimously praised and praised by the audience.

Recently, a group of young people in Shanghai who love music, because they feel that there are too few opportunities to appreciate music, initiated the organization of record concerts. Under the current circumstances, this can be regarded as an innovation. They held their first concert during the Easter holiday, and all the programs were works by Schubert. According to Schubert, a great genius, died unfortunately at the age of thirty-two, but left a rich legacy, including works in all departments of music. His music is relatively familiar in the understanding of the Chinese people, so this time there was a satisfactory harvest. Now they are scheduled to hold it every two weeks. Next Sunday's program is all the works of the Italian master Carolos. Other works such as Beethoven and Mozart are also scheduled to be played in the short term. However, because it is just beginning, there are many difficulties, and everything is still awaiting the support and well-intentioned criticism of the public.

Regarding the publications on music in Shanghai, it can be said that there is a complete lack of them. Only the French daily newspaper has a music criticism column every Sunday. Other recent Shanghai art monthly magazines also briefly introduce it, but there are too few words in this area to meet the needs of readers. We hope that the editors of the magazine can do their best in this area.

What can be predicted at present is that Aurora University will hold a concert on the 26th of this month, sung by Ms. Lang Yuxiu and others. In addition, on May 5th, there will be Li's second regular concert, all violin programs, with Alder, a violinist from the Shanghai Municipal Council Orchestra, participating in the performance. All music lovers, don't miss this opportunity. (Jinchuan)

### Taiwan Bank Military Notes Fraudulently Cashed

One Check Paper Missing, Totaling 40,000 Yuan

The Japanese-owned Taiwan Bank at No. 20 Jiujiang Road discovered during reconciliation the other day that military notes worth 40,000 yuan (equivalent to 280,000 yuan in national currency) had been fraudulently cashed. The bank immediately reported this to the Central Police Station, and Chinese detective Wu Yaozu went to investigate and confirmed the facts. A depositor in the bank used a check paper to cash Japanese military notes worth 40,000 yuan. The receiving clerk gave the check to Yang Songshou (resident of No. 89, Baisongfang, Huage Road), a local in charge of verifying signatures, for verification. After verifying that it was correct, Yang Songshou stamped it and sent it to the cashier's department for payment. When the accounts were reconciled, the cashier's department had an account for this 40,000 yuan, but Yang Songshou's account had no such account. Moreover, the check could not be found. An investigation of the depositor also revealed that they had not cashed this amount. It was also discovered that one of the deposit account's check papers was missing. It appeared that someone had stolen an old check, forged the signature, fraudulently cashed this huge sum of money, and then tried to steal the check in order to destroy the evidence. The most suspected persons in this incident are Yang Songshou and the trainees Wang Amao and Lu Binghe, who are natives of Yong. Yang and the others were taken to the police station for investigation, but they all denied it. They were temporarily detained and will be investigated thoroughly before further action is taken.

### Rongwu Sutra, The Doctrine of the Mean Essence

The 42nd session of the Rongwu Sutra Society and the 8th session of the National Studies Lecture, Mr. Yang Zhongyi lectured on the essence of The Doctrine of the Mean (III), saying: "The Doctrine of the Mean is the 31st chapter of the Book of Rites. Kong Shu quotes Zheng's catalogue, 'This book belongs to general discussion in the separate records.' Yan's note in the Han Shu says, 'The Book of Rites has The Doctrine of the Mean, which is not the original scripture of Rites.' The Summary of the Four Libraries says, 'The Han scholars compiled it into the Book of Rites because it has nothing to attach to. In fact, it does not belong to the Five Rites.'

### Announcement of Winners in Unified Lottery: Bond Markets Excited

The bond market, at two o'clock yesterday, was suddenly excited because the winning numbers for the 13th round of Type A bonds, totaling 44 numbers, had been published in the newspapers. There were also reports of peace talks between England and Germany, although far from being a reality, it was enough to slightly excite the weary public. Furthermore, the most noteworthy event was the change in policy regarding the sale of shares by the large Kangcheng company. The short sellers temporarily lost their support, and market prices soared upwards. Yitai was the first to buy in, and Lianhe also bought in aggressively, with both companies buying about 600,000 to 700,000 shares. Tongkang sold off shares, leading to speculation that Dakangcheng also sold off 200,000 to 300,000 shares. Therefore, when Type C bonds rose to 1.2 yuan, sellers emerged in large numbers, including Shuntai, Jiufeng, Hu Heji, Lianyi, Hongda, Yongkang, and Dechang, all offering shares. Although Shunli, Tongshun, Xiekang, Gongmao, Xinji, Runde, and Hongxing, among others, continued to buy, the price of Type C bonds still fell back to 0.66 or 0.67 yuan. However, market sentiment was more stable than before. Even if Dakangcheng were to sell off more shares, it would be a spent force, and the outlook should improve slightly. Currently, Type D and Type E bonds are the cheapest, with Type E being more than 3 yuan cheaper than Type C, and Type D being 6 yuan cheaper. It is expected that some will switch from Type C to Type D and Type E. As a result, market prices generally rebounded by several angles to 1.1 yuan, with approximately 1.2 million to 1.3 million yuan in transactions. A summary table is listed below: Category Highest Lowest Closing Change from Previous Day Unified Type A 68.00 67.50 Rose by 1.10 Unified Type B 61.80 61.20 61.20 Rose by 0.20 Unified Type C 61.20 60.50 60.85 Rose by 0.65 Unified Type D 55.50 54.40 54.85 Rose by 1.05 Unified Type E 58.00 57.70 57.70 Rose by 0.70

### Many Foreign Stocks Rise

Yesterday, many foreign stocks rose again, but trading volume remained scarce, totaling 17,900 shares. Jardine Matheson (Yihe) spun 5,700 shares, with the price declining from 33.5 yuan to 32.75 yuan, then rebounding to 33.5 yuan, resulting in a slight increase of 0.25 yuan. Sino-British (Xinhe) traded 1,000 shares, rising from 11.2 yuan to 11.4 yuan, an increase of 0.2 yuan. China Textile (Zhongfang) traded 500 shares at 15 yuan. Jardine Brewery (Yihe Pijiu) traded 5,000 shares, rising from 8.3 yuan to 8.8 yuan, an increase of 0.4 yuan. Asia Navigation (Yazhou Hangye) traded 1,000 shares at 8.9 yuan. Ken Zhi traded 500 shares at 32 yuan. Kaihu traded 500 shares at 52 yuan, an increase of 2 yuan. Shanghai Wool (Shanghai Maorong) traded 500 shares at 8.8 yuan. Yangzi traded 500 shares at 12.5 yuan.

But the bullish sentiment was strong, rising to the highest price of 3,840 yuan at closing.

### Cloth Transactions Scarce

Factory cloth: Yesterday the market was firm, but transactions remained scarce. 16-pound Double Elephant coarse cloth was offered at 245 yuan, Globe at 210 yuan, and Flying Goose at 196 yuan. 12-pound Da Peng fine cloth was offered at 193 yuan, Globe at 190 yuan, and Fugui spot goods at 180 yuan, while warehouse orders required 185 yuan.

### Woolen Fabrics Are Easy to Rise and Hard to Fall

Ramie cloth continues to rise

Yesterday, the woolen fabric market was tight again. Winter and summer goods saw further price increases because inventories were increasingly short. Both domestic and foreign traders were hoarding goods, holding onto them tightly and not releasing them. Many businesses were buying in and rarely selling. Although actual sales were lower than before due to the high prices, the demand from tailors was not weak. Shops were taking many orders for two or three-piece suits, leading to rising prices for wool, cotton, silk, yarn, and ramie textiles. Even percales and horsehair canvas, which had once retreated, are now rising again. Overall, the recent woolen fabric market has become easy to rise and hard to fall. Traders view overcoating wools as particularly scarce and expensive. Yesterday, Jardine Matheson and Yingfeng percales were selling for 110 yuan per yard, Lixing for 120 yuan, horsehair canvas for 3 yuan, Gongping soft lining for 6 yuan, Yousheng waterproof cloth for 20 yuan, Pao Po Lin for 23 yuan, Yuanfeng Van Alen topping for 188 yuan, Meifeng overcoating wool for 250 yuan, Gongda overcoating wool for 150 yuan, and Jardine Matheson 1-28 riding breeches for 188 yuan. Ramie cloth also rose again due to inventory shortages and the temporary shutdown of production at the two major factories, Baoxin and Lianxin. Additionally, the Nanjing Gang Huasheng Dun Lianxing received permits to ship out 500 bolts. The prices of all kinds of goods were rising, and as the weather warmed up, actual sales to the market resumed, and the trend turned around again, with prices rising again. Yesterday, Baoxin Whale Star brand ramie cloth was selling in batches at 10.05 yuan per yard, Lianxin Dafugui at 10 yuan, and Gongda sold military tickets for 4.75 yuan. Sanjiang ramie cloth was selling for 57-58 yuan, and 36-inch Belgian ramie cloth was selling for 40 yuan.

### Cash Shops Have Supply: Boiled Red Continues to Fall

Yesterday, the black market for cash and boiled red continued to decline slightly, with a total of 70-80 taels traded. Sentiment was soft, and cash shops were still willing to supply. They first sold 10 taels to a certain bank for 18,200 yuan, which was 200 yuan lower than the previous day. Then it rebounded slightly. A certain securities firm purchased 30 taels of cash on behalf of the Tianjin gang from a cash shop, with the final transaction price at 18,300 yuan. At noon, sellers offered at the above price, and buyers returned to 18,200 yuan, more than 100 yuan lower than the previous day.

Jewelers were exchanging ornaments at 1,900 yuan per tael (purchase price reduced by 100 yuan). Silver bars were quoted at 18 yuan, and the black market retreated to around 13.5 yuan. Silver coins also retreated to 8 yuan, with few transactions, it is said.

### Interbank Discounting Rate Drops by Five Yuan

Yesterday, the interbank lending rate set by the Money Trade Association remained at 7%. The discounting rate for head-marked checks dropped from around 30 yuan per thousand to 15 yuan, a further decrease of 5 yuan, it is said.

### Foreign Currencies Remain Weak

Yesterday, the foreign currency market was uneventful. British and American gold pounds remained unchanged, the former at 430 yuan and the latter at 440 yuan. US dollar notes retreated to a buying price of 29 yuan and a selling price of 30 yuan. Hong Kong notes continued to rise to 4.2 yuan, with large notes decreasing by 0.1 yuan. Military notes opened at 7.3 yuan in the morning, then retreated to 7.22 yuan, and finally closed at 7.25 yuan, slightly down by 0.02 yuan from the previous day.

### Rice Prices Soar: No Standards

Continuous rain has brought business from the surrounding areas to a standstill. It is also rumored that the purchase price in rural villages in the interior has increased by 0.9 yuan per liter due to the availability of cheap Yao ocean rice, followed by further price increases. As a result, the costs have increased, and asking prices have also been raised. Yesterday, it was rumored that goods could not be sourced from the surrounding areas, and prices outside the city were soaring, around 400 yuan. At the same time, early and late rice in the French Concession continued to rise sharply, selling at 435 yuan, 430 yuan, high-end at 440 yuan, 438 yuan. In the British Concession, it rose to 450 yuan, 445 yuan, a sharp increase of over 20 yuan. There were transactions without a market, and prices had no standards.

### Coarse Grains Driven Up by Rice

Yesterday's coarse grains market saw a slight recovery, influenced by rising rice prices. Sales in the local market were quite good, so the prices of all goods rose together. However, due to the ongoing controls, transactions were still limited. A unified market sold 100 bags of Tianjin Jinyuan at 223 yuan, cash on delivery. 80 bags of Chongming Shachi at 199 yuan. 50 bags of Taicang Red Bean at 196 yuan. Over 100 bags of Wujiang picked green at 200 yuan. Shengji soybean cake new warehouse orders for April, 4,000 pieces, traded at 50.05 to 51.5 yuan. And old warehouse orders for May, 3,500 pieces, traded at 43-44 yuan. Lizi soybean cake new warehouse orders for January, 1,000 pieces, traded at 50 yuan.

### Rayon Market Fluctuates

Yesterday's rayon market went from weak to firm. In the morning, 120 Tianqiao bright silk small boxes opened at 8,700 yuan, then rose to 8,750 yuan, and then returned to 8,720 yuan. 120 Golden Rooster semi-gloss large boxes traded at 8,840 yuan, an increase of 15 yuan from the previous day. 75 Golden Rooster semi-gloss small boxes opened at 8,240 yuan, then gradually decreased to 8,200 yuan. 120 White Fuji bright silk small boxes opened at 8,600 yuan, it is said.

### Soap and Matches: Difficult to Sell

The market for daily necessities showed little change. Because sales channels are still narrow, speculators are stagnant. The market is oversupplied. Yesterday, Gu Ben soap was selling at 320 yuan, White Xiangmao soap at 300 yuan, Yellow Xiangmao soap at 280 yuan, Arrow Knife soap at 285 yuan, Beauty Brand matches at 5,500 yuan, Phoenix Brand at 5,300 yuan, and White Lees Brand candles at 170 yuan, Sengmao at 165 yuan.

### Cigarette Selling Prices

The downward trend of cigarettes is like a flood, causing great discouragement. Although there are widespread rumors of a possible increase in additional taxes, it does not attract attention from all parties and is still weak and difficult to boost. This is due to the weakness of actual sales, so prices continue to show a downward trend. Great British Brand was selling at 9,600 yuan per case, Old Knife Brand at 8,700 yuan, Pin Hai Brand at 6,100 yuan, Little Fairy Brand at 5,600 yuan, and Five Flower Brand at 5,400 yuan, a further decrease of 100 yuan from the previous day. Japanese cigarettes saw mixed increases and decreases. Golden Gun Brand traded at 2,450 yuan, Golden Building at 2,550 yuan, Quanlu Brand at 2,800 yuan, and Red Rose at 2,050 yuan, with the end result being very little change. Domestic cigarettes, Beauty Brand at 5,250 yuan, and Golden Mouse Brand at 3,150 yuan, also trended towards softness, with the price of 25,000 cigarettes down by 150 yuan from the previous day.

### Soy Sauce and Vegetables Scarce and Expensive

Five-spice vegetables, a common side dish, were originally very cheap. Before the Great War, they were less than 200 yuan. Now they are also expensive, reaching 370 yuan. It is said that goods en route have already been shipped out and will arrive soon, but the exchange rate is still high, and it is difficult to expect a price decrease. Soy sauce and vegetables are scarce on the market and even more expensive, reaching 500 yuan.

### Port Longan Costs Increase

Shipments of Shima longan have been scarce for a long time, and inventories on the market are low. It has been learned that the most recent shipments have had dozens of cases transported to Shanghai, and the establishment costs are higher than before. External expenses have also increased, requiring an additional 50 to 60 yuan compared to before, it is said.

### Pearl Barley Continues to Rise by 100 Yuan

Because pearl barley has not arrived from any source, those holding goods are holding on to them even more firmly. Therefore, the market situation continues to tighten. Compared to the selling price at the beginning of the month, the increase has been nearly 100 yuan. Because market inventories are becoming thinner, the market is still expected to rise further.

War

### Wartime Life of the American People

— Wang Xuan

Recent news from Washington, transmitted by the Axis powers, briefly describes the impact of the war on the lives of the American people. At the same time, it also gives us a glimpse of America's active commitment to the war effort.

The lives of the American people have always been known for their excellence, seeking pleasure and enjoyment, surpassing the globe. But now, due to the launch of the war machine, this joyful life has come to an end. American retail stores have sufficient inventory, and people can still purchase all necessary household goods, but in the near future, supplies may become scarce, and a household rationing system may be implemented.

The installment payment method has always been popular in the United States. Many higher-priced goods, such as automobiles, can be paid for in installments to ease the burden. This method is now being greatly curtailed. When rationing is implemented, it may not be as strictly limited as in the United Kingdom, but canned goods will not be piled up in the kitchen as before, because canned goods are becoming scarce, and canning factories are trying to use other items to make canned goods to replace tinplate.

Relatively few people in the United States drink tea, but over time, tea may also become scarce, and coffee rationing is most likely. Other spices and olive oil, the sources of which have been occupied, will also gradually become scarce in the future. In addition, there are concerns about the lack of woolen clothing and household appliances in the United States. All woolen fabrics produced in the United States this year will be used by the military, and civilians can only buy cotton-wool blends.

The weaving of silk stockings for women has stopped, and in the future, they will only be able to wear cotton and rayon socks. However, what worries the ladies and young women most is that rubber is being used for military purposes, so they will not be able to buy elastic corsets to maintain their slender bodies.

Americans have always been accustomed to and consider indispensable vacuum cleaners, electric refrigerators, washing machines, radios, and electric toasters, etc., but now they cannot be purchased at will as in the past. A certificate must be obtained before they can be purchased, because the factories that manufacture these appliances have mostly been converted into armories. For all warring countries, airplanes, tanks, artillery, and ships are more important than cans, pots, and electrical appliances, so it will not be easy to obtain various metal products in the future. Even the springs in mattresses and sofas have stopped being manufactured.

Until now, the pig bristles used in the United States have to be imported from abroad. During wartime, shipping is inconvenient, so alternative products will soon be used to manufacture brushes, etc., and the wool content of wool balls will also be reduced. Also, the production of automobiles and typewriters has been stopped, and the production of bicycles is also limited. In short, when a country is in a state of war, the lives of the people are greatly affected.

Psychology

### What is Genius?

— He Kai

Can genius be measured? In fact, it can be measured and is being measured.

The United States has been engaged in extremely interesting experiments in the past few years. Recently, Professor Terman, a psychology professor at Stanford University, published his latest report. Professor Terman has been focusing on the study of genius for more than ten years.

These findings cannot tell us how to observe the budding of genius in little John or Mary, but they do tell us what they will probably become if they are indeed clever. However, the chance of Mary or any girl becoming a genius is close to zero. At the same time, Professor Terman shattered the general illusion of the past that genius is a freak with only one-sided talent.

"The typical genius is not a prodigy in a fragile body," he said. "The typical genius is healthier than the average person, and does not focus his interests on one side, while being foolish about everything else. He is versatile and able to do many things. He is not the fool in the family. The typical genius is not a poor wretch who frantically extracts his talent from the depths of his afflicted body and mind."

"He is happy, lives a happy married life, and is content with his work, hobbies, and family."

This is the result of his measurement of genius. Thirty years ago, he selected 1,300 of the most gifted children in California, accounting for about 5% of the total population, and followed their subsequent development step by step. He was able to maintain contact with 95% of them and conducted regular surveys of the entire group. In his most recent survey, he found that some of them had achieved very superior positions in the business world and specialized professions, while others were in minor positions. He called them class A and class C.

Why did some succeed and others fail? They had roughly equal opportunities.

He found that the successful ones, that is, the true geniuses, always maintained a stable temperament. Their emotions never fell into confusion, and past records proved that this trace could be detected in them when they were children.

He found that Class A married earlier than Class C, had happier marriages, and achieved better marital adjustment. There were three times fewer divorce cases in Class A than in Class C.

The professor believes that it is sad that sex seems to be the most important factor governing genius. He said that if a talented woman cannot marry early, she will take up any job that can be found. In view of this, the professor said that he would no longer measure the genius of women.

### Random Notes on Gibraltar

— Da Fen

The long-silent name of Gibraltar has now reappeared in the news. The situation in Europe today is like the wind filling the building before the rain comes. What position will this fortress at the Mediterranean mouth of the British Empire occupy?

It is said that Gibraltar has many elite troops stationed there. In the event of war, they will hide in the rock bunkers day and night, year after year, to defend this important stronghold.

It is impossible for any army to land from the sea and surprise Gibraltar. The rocks are steep, reaching a height of 1,200 feet, and the safe guards are all watching intently, leaving little room for opportunity. Heavy artillery, bombs, poison gas, hunger, or thirst may shake their fighting spirit for a while, but that is hard to say.

Outsiders are not allowed to visit the Gibraltar fortress. In the past, it was possible to visit the old fortresses left over from the Moorish wars, but now even that opportunity is gone. Outsiders can only imagine, without having the chance to see its true face. In short, inside there are rocks, cannons, armories, power plants, hospitals, etc. It is said that the cannons high above are all fakes, to consume the enemy's firepower, while the real cannons are hidden in the rocks below.

But how strong Gibraltar's resistance is can only be verified. Moreover, no one dares to predict what will happen if an offensive comes from land from Spain. But one thing can be asserted, that is, Gibraltar's food and munitions reserves are very abundant, enough to last for five years.

### Literary Men's Handwriting

— Fan Shengzhi

Since literary men take writing as their main occupation, they inevitably spend their days with desks, pens, and paper, weaving their thoughts and inspirations into articles. The original manuscript of a famous work is often placed in a museum as a priceless treasure, forever inspiring future generations with high admiration. However, some are unfortunate; their ink hardly dries before becoming patrons of the editor's wastepaper basket, which is truly regrettable.

Therefore, a literary man's handwriting, that is, their script, is closely related to both the literary man themselves and the publishing industry, as well as bookstores. From a cultural perspective, it holds considerable historical value. In various European countries, museums have sections dedicated to exhibiting writers' original manuscripts, and writers' former residences are open to the public, showcasing their daily life and displaying their handwriting. Even ink blots on blotting paper are faintly visible. Places like the Gorky Museum in the Soviet Union, the studio of Mayakovsky, and the former residences of Wordsworth in England and Daudet's mill in France have become famous tourist attractions.

The handwriting of literary men and writers evokes a sense of intimacy. If you were to see the original manuscripts of Tolstoy's "Resurrection" and "War and Peace," with their web-like traces of multiple revisions, you would feel how much hard work the creator underwent to produce such a monumental work and spiritual food. Tolstoy's wife copied "War and Peace" seven times! Balzac, who created novels in a short period of time, hurriedly sent them to print, and after printing, felt dissatisfied and corrected them. He often corrected and reprinted a novel several times, leaving new handwriting annotations beside the printed words. Even today, French museums still preserve several of these sheets.

A miracle is often discovered from the handwriting of literary men: their handwriting is not necessarily good and is often called atrocious. Take Shakespeare, for example. His plays are immortal, but he was a famous poor writer. His handwriting was worse than that of an elementary school student. Perhaps when inspiration flows and thoughts surge, there is no time to care about the neatness of handwriting. When O'Henry had a "brainstorm," he would scribble on large-format manuscript paper with a reed pen, sometimes unable to decipher it himself. The manuscripts of the poet Carlyle were so illegible that the clerks who copied them often made mistakes, and after copying them, he would add and delete them again with a red ink pen, turning the manuscript paper into a palette. He said in a letter to a friend: "I am ashamed of my bad handwriting, but if I write slowly, the words may be neat, but the meaning I want to write will be forgotten. There is really no way to think about it." Even Rousseau, whose handwriting was beautiful, said: "If thinkers and creators write beautifully, their overflowing thoughts may not be fully expressed." This is probably the predicament of most writers.

Modern writers, especially American writers such as Lewis and Sinclair, have adopted commercial habits, replacing pens and ink with typewriters. This saves publishers some trouble with proofreading, but it also loses a sense of intimacy. However, as the younger Tolstoy said, "When writing with a typewriter, when you read it again, it has the meaning of reading the works of others and gaining a more objective meaning." The younger Tolstoy probably understood this benefit and often liked to write with a typewriter.

But in general, most people consider handwriting to be lovely and precious. In ancient China, literary men mostly sold both articles and calligraphy, and even took calligraphy as their main occupation, so it was rare to hear of poor handwriting among ancient Chinese literary men. Aren't the handwritings of the "Four Talents of Tang, Zhu, Wen, and Zhou" treasured by later book collectors? But I heard that there are many new literary men with strange handwritings, but because of square Chinese characters, no writer has been heard to have "evolved" to writing with a typewriter.

### Firefighting Weapon

— Zhang Qiao

When houses and warehouses catch fire, firefighters are often unable to enter immediately because the doors and windows are locked. Therefore, someone invented an oxygen-fueled flame cutter that can spray high heat, instantly melting steel and metal. Therefore, it is very suitable for cutting steel doors and iron locks. This thing is placed in a canvas bag and carried on the firefighter's back, weighing only forty-three pounds. Firefighters can also carry it on their backs and climb to high places to work, which is much more convenient.

### Sharing the Same Boat in Storm

— He Jia Zhi

(Three) Guests Arrive

Wei Cheng told Huang Long the reason why he couldn't go, and Madam Ye Er helped him speak, saying it was late, cold, and inappropriate to drink alcohol while in mourning—all their reasons. Huang Long said: "So even if I brought the wine and dishes, Brother Wei Cheng couldn't eat them. Alright, I'll go." Huang Long picked up the lantern and waved it at Wei Cheng, as if waving goodbye. He walked to the courtyard, then came back and smiled: "Brother Wei Cheng, I don't hate you for not going." He stated this before striding out. Madam Ye Er said: "This person is always reckless, arriving abruptly and leaving strangely." Ah Xing laughed outside the door: "I'll let him in. His nose is snorting with anger, shooting out a white vapor, just like the light from a flashlight, and if he were born in the Song Dynasty, he would probably be a person like Niu Gao." Magpie also said, as if having a bone stuck in her throat that she had to spit out: "That morning, didn't he leave early? As soon as he went out, he raced with the dog we raised at home, and he ran even faster than the dog."

Another knock on the door interrupted the family's casual conversation. Madam Ye Er said, "Huang Long has changed his mind again and is inviting you. Are you going or not? If you want to go, let Ah Xing go with you. If you're cold, wrap your father's fox fur coat around yourself. Anyway, the first week has passed, and there's nothing to do tomorrow." Wei Cheng said, "I'm not going, I'm not going." Ah Xing opened the door for the person knocking, but it wasn't Huang Long. It was a country woman, also carrying a lantern in her hand. Madam Ye Er thought her face looked familiar but couldn't remember who she was. When the country woman saw Madam Ye Er and Wei Cheng, she said with anticipation: "Young Master Ye, it's terrible. Cui Zhen and her uncle have fallen out. Her uncle is being unreasonable. Please, Young Master Ye, go quickly!" Wei Cheng was stunned, and so were the others. Madam Ye Er hurriedly asked what the matter was. According to the country woman, she was a neighbor of Fei Changhe. Fei Changhe argued with Cui Zhen every few days, and others pitied Cui Zhen, but Cui Zhen always refused to tell others. (51)
