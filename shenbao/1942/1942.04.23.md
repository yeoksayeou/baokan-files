### Australian Industrial Standardization: Government Proposes to Parliament, Former Prime Minister Expresses Opposition

Sydney, May 21st, Havas: The Australian Federal Government's proposal to Parliament for industrial standardization has aroused opposition from various quarters. Conservatives believe that the government should not take socialist measures in Australia by taking advantage of the situation. Former Prime Minister Fadden has strongly criticized the government's plan to reorganize private banking and industry, especially opposing the order for manufacturers to produce the same goods under the same trademark. Prime Minister Curtin replied today, saying, "Take toothpaste, for example. If there are forty companies in the country manufacturing different toothpastes, there will be competition among them and sales across the country, which will inevitably affect the transport vehicles needed for the war effort. This kind of situation is difficult to tolerate under the current circumstances."

All general staffs and joint general staffs are under the supervision of the Prime Minister. The Joint General Staff has three departments: Military Strategy Design, Execution Design, and Future Tactical Design. All decisions are generally related to political and economic matters, so the Foreign Office also has a representative permanently stationed in the department. The War Office, the Ministry of Transport, the Ministry of Economic Warfare, and the Security Department will send liaison officers to attend meetings when necessary.

Stockholm, May 22nd, Reuter: According to a report from London, London newspapers are discussing the war on the European continent between Britain and the United States. The "Daily Telegraph" yesterday published a Washington dispatch stating that the discussions in Washington between U.S. Army Chief of Staff Marshall and the Allied Commissioner in London are continuing at the White House. Marshall and Hopkins, while in London, advocated the establishment of a second front in Europe, regardless of success or failure. President Roosevelt believes that the establishment of a second front is the best support for the Soviet Union, and is more necessary than the supply of war materials affected by tonnage shortages. Roosevelt and his two representatives stated that the American people hope that American war materials can be supplied to the British and American troops fighting on the European front, which is more welcome than supplying the Soviet army. The "Daily Mail" believes that the offensive to save Europe has already been decided, and necessary preparations are now underway. Plans for future operations are being drafted on Downing Street. Once the war begins, it will become the newest page in history. The newspaper concludes, "Everyone should be prepared, especially the military personnel, who must do their best." The "Daily Mail" stated that Britain must be sure of the results before taking action, otherwise it will cause another defeat.

### General Wavell Broadcasts to India

New Delhi, May 21st, Reuters: General Wavell, Commander-in-Chief of the Indian Army, delivered a broadcast speech in New Delhi tonight, stating that "no force can prevent us from achieving victory," but defeatism and unreasonable panic may hinder or delay the arrival of victory. "One of the most prominent leaders in India recently called on the Indian people to rise up and resist, and to break the belief in defeatism. If all sectors of India, from top to bottom, can calmly deal with the danger, and work together in their offices, factories, or villages, and serve India, then we will have nothing to fear in this crisis, and part of my heavy responsibility can be lifted. We still have difficult times ahead, and my responsibility to you is also very heavy. I know that the Allied countries have recognized the danger facing India and the importance of India to the war effort, and they are determined to help the Indian people and India to the greatest extent."

### There is Still Hope for a Solution to the Indian Problem; Only Requires Sincerity from the Indian Side; Cripps Reports to Parliament on the Results of His Visit to India

London, May 22nd, Reuters: Lord Privy Seal Cripps met with Prime Minister Churchill last night to report on the results of his visit to India.

London, May 22nd, Reuters: Lord Privy Seal Cripps returned to the House of Commons today for the first time since returning from New Delhi, resuming his position as Leader of the House. Members of Parliament greeted him with cheers. Cripps told reporters today, "I believe that the Indian problem can be solved during the war. It must be negotiated by the Indian side. It is not currently possible to draft a new constitution for India. I can now outline the results of this mission. The most important thing is that the British War Cabinet has a clear plan, hoping to use this to lay the foundation for a final solution to the entire British-Indian problem with the emotional leaders of India, and at the same time enable the leaders of Indian public opinion to assist in the difficult task of organizing defense. The second point is that a new method was adopted for negotiations this time, that is, instead of inviting Indian representatives to London, a member of the War Cabinet was sent to India to discuss suitable plans with these representatives on the spot and to see if they could be accepted by the general public in India. The British Cabinet knows that this kind of plan may be generally accepted or rejected. Third, I believe that the contacts established in India during this trip have shown the current attitude of Britain towards the future of India after the war, so as to clarify the situation of India, Britain, the United States, and other related countries. India will have a period of mutual blame for the breakdown of negotiations. Those who participate in the negotiations will naturally argue that the position they have taken is justified and do not want to blame themselves for the breakdown. However, I personally do not want to blame anyone for the breakdown, but will take responsibility for the breakdown myself."

Hitler Calls on the German People to Donate Generously

### Hitler Calls on the German People to Donate Generously

Berlin, May 22nd, Reuter: Following the old tradition, Führer Hitler called on the German people to donate to the Red Cross. His text reads, "During the great test period this winter, millions of German soldiers are bravely fighting the enemy for the future of their motherland, their wives and children, and their nation, because the day the enemy wins is the day our nation perishes. Our people at home also understand this. They all know that the fate of our country and people is in the hands of the German soldiers. The suffering of the soldiers on the front lines is almost impossible for the people in the rear to repay, but if they can do their best to donate and rescue the soldiers injured in combat, then they have at least fulfilled part of their responsibility."

### Laval Arrives in Paris to Discuss National Affairs with His Subordinates; Champs Elysées to be Converted into Darlan's Headquarters

Paris, May 21st, Havas: The head of the French government, Laval, arrived here this morning from Vichy and immediately met in the afternoon with the French government's special envoy to the occupied areas, Brinon, the Paris police chief, Admiral Bard, the leader of the Franco-German Reconciliation Movement, Chiappe (note: the one who was targeted along with Laval in the Bourse assassination), and the new Minister of Finance, Cathala, for discussions. In addition, the former presidential palace on the Champs Elysées has begun to be arranged and will be used as the headquarters of Admiral Darlan, Commander-in-Chief of the French Army, Navy, and Air Force. Although Darlan will not be stationed in Paris for long, he will often come here to discuss important matters.

Vichy, May 22nd, Reuter: Newspapers in Morocco and Algeria yesterday prominently published on their front pages Marshal Pétain's communiqué and Laval's broadcast speech. The "Echo d'Alger" stated that the French people are willing to support the new government, and the Marshal instructed us to be patient and patriotic, and we should strictly observe discipline and strive for the spirit and territorial unity of the French Empire.

Vichy, May 21st, Havas: The "Temps" commented on the speech given yesterday by the head of the French government, Laval, saying that the program of the new French cabinet is nothing more than the following three points: (1) to establish an understanding with Germany based on full respect for France's honor and rights, (2) to participate in the fight against Bolshevism, and (3) to work together for a new European order. It is commendable that Head of State Laval has risen again in this difficult period and resumed power. France still has absolute confidence in its own destiny. Although it was defeated two years ago, the people did not despair at that time, and it is the same now. "The French nation always knows how to overcome difficulties when its freedom is shaken and encounters difficulties. The price we pay may be very high, and we may have to make sacrifices, it is true, but we have never doubted the greatness of France for a minute." As for the policy adopted by Laval, according to Laval himself, Pétain had already determined the basis for Franco-German cooperation when he met with German leader Hitler in Montoire in October 1940. He wants to continue to promote this policy and inform the people that he has always believed that Franco-German reconciliation is a prerequisite for European peace. However, another problem has arisen now, which is the European fight against Bolshevism. Therefore, we only have two options: one is to remain intact in the new Europe, and the other is to allow French civilization to be completely destroyed. Laval has already decided between the two. In other words, he has decided to continue to promote his policy through understanding and reconciliation."

Special Issue on the Indian Problem

### VI. India's Political Parties

We mentioned in our article on the internal composition of India that India is still essentially a British colony. This situation is reflected in the government in two ways: on one hand, Britain is unwilling to relinquish its control over India, and on the other hand, the Indian people are striving for their own freedom and independence. This is a contradiction, and it was the main reason for the failure of the Cripps Mission to India. However, we cannot say that the Indian problem will be immediately solved if Britain suddenly changes its past policy of "controlling India," because various factions within India are divided and have different opinions. Even without British intervention, their internal disputes cannot be resolved in a short time. In early February of this year, British Under-Secretary of State for India, Mr. Eden, stated in the House of Lords: "The key to the Indian problem lies more within India than in Britain. The National Congress claims to represent the entire country and strongly advocates unified self-government, while the Muslim League opposes it and demands the partition of India. Under these circumstances, how the government should hand over power to India has become a problem." Although this statement by Eden was intended to conceal the British government's unwillingness to grant India dominion status, it allows us to see the complexity within India and the inconsistencies in the positions of various factions.

There are many factions within India. Among the major ones are the National Congress, the Muslim League, the Mahasabha Party, and the Princes' Conference. For the sake of clarity, they are listed below:

1.  National Congress

The National Congress is the largest political party in India, with over four million members. Only the Soviet Communist Party, the German National Socialist Party, and the Chinese Kuomintang can match its size. Its members include extreme right-wing nationalists and extreme left-wing socialists. In its early days, its slogan was "strengthening the British-Indian union," but it later evolved into a group that "called on all Indian people, regardless of religion, caste, class, occupation, gender, or age, to unite and resist Britain." Before the war, they were already fighting vigorously for Indian independence. After the war, they explicitly put forward two demands: (A) the only way to solve the Indian problem is to grant India complete independence and comprehensive unification; (B) if Britain cannot accept this proposal, India will refuse to provide manpower and material support to Britain. The plan to resolve the Indian problem proposed by the British wartime cabinet during the Cripps Mission, which offered India dominion status after the war, could not satisfy the demands of the National Congress. Other proposals, such as bearing the responsibility for national defense and allowing provinces to maintain their existing constitutions, were considered by them to be proposals that undermine Indian independence and hinder Indian unification, and were therefore completely rejected. The leaders of this faction were formerly Gandhi and are now Nehru.

2.  Muslim League

Second to the National Congress is the Muslim League. India has a population of approximately 350 million, and Muslims account for 77 million of them, so their influence cannot be underestimated. The purpose of the Muslim League is to protect the interests of Muslims. The National Congress advocates inclusiveness, while the Muslim League adheres to a racial stance. The National Congress advocates comprehensive unification, while the Muslim League insists on the partition of India. They believe that if India is fully unified, Muslims will become vassals of the National Congress. For this reason, they demand from Britain: (A) If Britain wants to obtain the cooperation of Muslims, it must recognize the religious, cultural, economic, and social independence and freedom of Muslims; (B) India is not a purely unified nation, and Anglo-American democracy based on the premise of a purely unified nation is not applicable to India. The British cabinet proposal stated that "Indian provinces that do not wish to accept the federal constitution and wish to maintain their existing constitutions may do so as they wish," which was gladly supported by the Muslim League. However, they still could not agree with other points, such as bearing the responsibility for national defense, and therefore stated in their declaration that "it would be difficult to accept without some amendments." The leader of this faction is Jinnah.

3.  Mahasabha Party

The Mahasabha Party is a political entity that opposes the Muslim League. Their slogan is to repel the Muslim League and protect the interests of Hinduism, which is what distinguishes them from the National Congress. Their ultimate goal is also complete independence and liberation for India, but they would be satisfied with dominion status during the transition period. After the war, they advocated that if the British government could protect the legitimate interests of Hinduism and announce that it would effectively grant India dominion status one year after the end of the war, the Mahasabha Party would fully support Britain and conduct the war. However, in the current wartime cabinet proposal, although the point of dominion status was granted as requested, they strongly opposed the points of bearing the responsibility for national defense and allowing partition. Savarkar is their leader.

4.  Princes' Conference

The Princes' Conference is a status quo maintenance faction. Their position is conservative, opposing revolution and secession from Britain. Their interests may not be entirely consistent with those of Britain, but they can generally be said to be common. Therefore, since the war, they have strongly advocated unconditional assistance to Britain. However, the current wartime cabinet's proposal for India did not provide special protection for the interests of the princes, which was also unsatisfactory to the Princes' Conference. The princes of Nawanagar and Bikaner are the leaders of this faction.

In addition to these four major parties, there are also the Indian Progressive Party, led by Huk; the Liberal Party, led by Sapru; the Indian Depressed Classes, led by Ambedkar; the Liberal Party, led by Sapro; the Indian Hindu Mahasabha, led by Monu; the Indian National League, led by Aham, etc. The common goals of these parties and factions are to demand independence and unification, but their mutual opposition and checks and balances on trivial issues are no less than those of the four major parties mentioned above. Cripps said when he first met with reporters: "Some people say that I hope that the London proposals can be accepted in their entirety, which is too optimistic. Given the complexity of the internal situation in India, even if one party or a few political parties oppose the London proposals, it would not be surprising to me." This can be used to explain the complexity of the parties within India.

Finally, we should especially mention Gandhi and Nehru. Not only are they the leaders of India's largest political party, but their ideas are also indeed worthy of people's agreement. Gandhi's given name is Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi. However, most people now call him Mahatma Gandhi and avoid his surname. People already know Gandhi's life's work, so now we can only talk about his fundamental spirit, which is the word "love." He loves everyone, not only loving his neighbor and his enemy like Christ, but also loving the wicked and all things, and he strives to practice "non-violence." This is the greatness of Gandhi's personal spirit and character, but in today's era, it has become his shortcoming. Nehru's given name is Jawaharlal. He is astute, capable, and has fresh ideas. He is a disciple of Gandhi, but he does not agree with his absolute peace proposals. He opposes violence, but also advocates resisting violence with force. Ten years ago, people used to say: "As long as Gandhi exists, Nehru will never be able to gain the position of leader." Who knew that in a few years, the sage Gandhi would only retain the position of elder statesman, while the young Nehru would become the actual leader. This is the creation of the times. By observing the advance and retreat of these two great leaders, we can also know the trend of the Indian national movement.

### British Forces in the Near East Take Precautionary Measures, Major Improvements to Military Transportation Networks, Establishing Diplomatic Relations with Egypt

Havas News Agency, Berne, 21st - The "Neue Zürcher Zeitung" recently carried a dispatch from a correspondent in London stating that although the Near East is not expected to be attacked immediately, the British General Headquarters in the region has taken precautionary measures. After the Australian troops (part of the Ninth Army) under General Mellan were transferred back to Australia, the defensive zone they built was taken over by British forces. At the same time, the transportation network in the Near East, especially the railway transportation between Palestine, Egypt, and Syria and Turkey, is currently undergoing major improvements. A railway line connecting the ports of Haifa in Palestine and Tripoli in Syria is currently under construction, 150 miles in length, and will soon be open to traffic. Most of the workers are black people from South Africa, and recently white workers have also traveled from South Africa to the Near East to participate in the construction of bridges and tunnels. The intention behind Britain's active improvement of transportation is clearly to facilitate military operations on the one hand, and to develop economic relations between Egypt and the Soviet Union on the other. Since 1917, diplomatic relations have not been established between Egypt and the Soviet Union, but it is expected that Egypt will recognize the Soviet Union in the shortest possible time. London considers this issue to be of great significance, as Muslims will clearly be in a very important position in the future war in the Near East.

Havas News Agency, Cairo, 21st - The Egyptian government has authorized its ambassadors in various countries to establish relations with Soviet diplomatic personnel and to attend receptions at Soviet embassies and consulates.

### Egyptian Parliament Trusts Government, Prime Minister Clarifies Policy of Avoiding Involvement in War

Haitong News Agency, Ankara, 22nd - The Egyptian Parliament yesterday passed a vote of confidence in the Nahas government by a vote of 185 to 0. Six members of parliament abstained from voting.

Reuters, Cairo, 22nd - Prime Minister Nahas declared in the House of Representatives yesterday that Egyptian foreign policy is based on avoiding involvement in the whirlpool of war and preventing Egyptian soldiers and workers from participating in any military work. However, it must be formally stated that the Egyptian government will take strong measures to ensure the safety of British troops and their allied forces stationed on Egyptian territory.

### Spanish Foreign Minister Clarifies Foreign Policy, Maintaining Friendship with France, Anti-Communism Unwavering

Havas News Agency, Madrid, 21st - Foreign Minister Suñer recently clarified foreign policy to the press, stating that Spain is determined to resist communism by all means. There are currently 15,000 Spanish volunteers fighting on the Eastern Front, but if the threat from the Soviet Union continues to grow, I am convinced that more than one million Spaniards will go to the front lines to fight those who threatened Spanish national destiny during our civil war a few years ago. Regarding Latin America, the attitudes adopted by the governments of all countries except Argentina and Chile have violated the highest ideals of Iberian-Americanism, which is regrettable. As for France, it used to misunderstand our country's political situation, but in the past two years, relations between the two countries have been very good. Marshal Pétain has always been praised by the Spanish people. Recently, Laval has regained power, and I am confident that he will be able to implement policies that are suitable for the true interests of France. In addition, relations between Portugal and Spain have also improved significantly and are currently very harmonious.

### Anders Arrives in London

### Turkey in a Precarious Situation

In this war, Turkey is situated between Germany and the Soviet Union, and its position is delicate. Recently, due to the progress of the Baben case trial, Soviet-Turkish relations have become increasingly tense, with the possibility of severing diplomatic relations at any time. Turkish Undersecretary of State for Foreign Affairs Amena Siglu declared to the press that "Turkey hopes to maintain neutrality in this world war, but the situation is extremely difficult and special caution is required." This shows the precarious situation of Turkey. (Left picture) A bronze statue of Kemal Atatürk, the father of Turkey, is watching over the entire city of Ankara.

### Fierce Fighting on the Eastern Front, Soviet Forces Continue to Make Progress, Constant Artillery Battles in the Smolensk Region, Soviet Forces Capture Strongholds in the North and Center

Reuters, Kuibyshev, 22nd - The German-Soviet war has entered its eleventh month today. Soviet forces are continuing to take political action on the northern, Kalinin, and Leningrad fronts. The most important issue on the Leningrad front is to recover territory and rebuild useful transportation. Although the fighting on the Kalinin front seems to be local in nature, and the territory recovered by the Soviet forces is not extensive, the Soviet forces are still advancing. As for the central front, there have only been local battles in recent weeks. Only the Bely region has heard of strategic fierce battles. However, Soviet guerrillas have been quite active in the Smolensk region behind the German forces on the central front. The artillery battles in this area are also fierce. On the southwestern line, the Don River basin and the southern front, German reserves have arrived at the front line and have launched counterattacks with the assistance of tanks. According to today's news, German forces on the northern front have launched repeated counterattacks. After three days of fierce fighting, Soviet forces have occupied a high ground.

Reuters, Moscow, 22nd - A supplementary communiqué from the Soviet Information Bureau at noon stated that Soviet forces on the western (central) line had occupied a German defensive position. Soviet forces also deployed artillery to defeat the resistance of the German garrison. German forces near "K" on the Kalinin front launched repeated counterattacks, all of which were repulsed. In addition, the Soviet noon communiqué only stated that "on the night of April 21, there were no major changes on the front lines."

Reuters, London, 21st - The Norwegian News Agency reported that Hitler has now dispatched several additional German divisions to defend the Norwegian coast.

Our forces advanced through enemy-held positions in the forest, capturing thirteen cannons and many enemies. Our fighter and dive bomber groups attacked enemy railway lines in the rear, and three trains carrying military supplies were hit and exploded, destroying many sleepers and forcing the trains to stop.

Havas News Agency, Stockholm, 21st - Military sources here recently stated that the fighting on the Finnish-Soviet front has become more active in the past two days. The Red Army, under the cover of tanks, has launched a fierce attack on the Finnish positions, with Soviet paratroopers landing behind them. Since last autumn, this is the first time that the Red Army has launched an offensive on the Finnish-Soviet front. According to German war reports, German forces have been transferred to the Finnish-Soviet front to participate in the fighting in the western part of the Isthmus of Onas. The Red Army initially made some progress, but was later repulsed. The Finnish positions are solid, and the supply of ammunition is constant. Both the left and right wings are shielded by forests and marshes. In addition, all routes on the Eastern Front were quiet yesterday, with only slight contact northeast of Smolensk. The Red Army attempted to cut off the railway between Smolensk and Vyazma, but so far, this railway is still held by German forces.

Havas News Agency, Stockholm, 21st - A Berlin correspondent for the "Dagens Nyheter" recently reported that the German Air Force is preparing to launch a "surprise attack" on the Soviet Union. The Germans have created two new types of bombers and armored destroyers that the Red Army will find difficult to resist. The Germans also plan to use giant transport planes, each capable of carrying 150 fully equipped soldiers. There is also a type of aircraft that can even carry light tanks, along with their onboard guns and personnel. It is said that this aircraft will also appear on the Soviet front. Currently, the Germans are focusing on transporting military supplies, even more than transporting troops to the Eastern Front. On average, a train passes through each railway station every fifteen minutes. Since last winter, German sappers have also been extremely active and have invented a new type of bridge that can be used by troops and even trains to cross swampy areas in the Soviet war zone, which will greatly facilitate future marching. As for German factories, which were busy manufacturing sleds last autumn, they are now rushing to build new "ultra-light cars" that can even pass through Soviet muddy areas.

### Suspension of Half-Price Return-to-Hometown Certificates Leads to Sharp Increase in People Leaving Shanghai; Recent Daily Issuance Exceeds 5,000; Nearly 400,000 People Dispersed Since the Evacuation Began

According to the English-language "Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury," the Shanghai Municipal Council (SMC) of the Public Concession's announcement that it would cease issuing half-price return-to-hometown certificates to Chinese residents starting May 1st has had a significant effect. The number of people leaving Shanghai to return to their hometowns has increased again recently. This information is known by reviewing weekly statistical reports. According to the report, in the weeks before the SMC issued the announcement, approximately 4,350 people returned to their hometowns daily. After the announcement was issued, the number suddenly increased, with 4,314 people on Saturday, 2,478 on Sunday, and 5,539 on Monday. The total number of people repatriated yesterday (the 21st) is not yet known, but it is expected to increase further.

Increasing Numbers of People Returning to Hometowns Daily

According to personnel handling repatriation matters at the SMC, this morning (the 22nd), they stated that the number of people returning to their hometowns might increase daily until April 30th, as many Chinese residents wish to take advantage of this last opportunity to return home at half price. The number of people repatriated varies daily, generally increasing on Tuesdays and Thursdays and decreasing on rainy days. Although half-price certificates are issued as usual on Sundays, the number of applicants will likely decrease significantly. The SMC's offices for issuing half-price certificates are located throughout the Public Concession, with the easternmost office at the SMC Public School on Baikal Road and the westernmost at the SMC Primary School on Singapore Road. Each office has eleven staff members.

Ningbo Has the Most People Returning to Their Native Place; A Total of 367,447 Half-Price Certificates Have Been Issued to Date; This Number Only Includes Certificates Issued by the SMC; Those Issued by Various Native Place Associations Are Not Included; The Maximum Number of Half-Price Certificates Issued in One Day Was 7,330; Until Recently, the Average Daily Issuance Was 6,000 Certificates, Which then Decreased to Around 4,500; Now This Number Has Increased Again; About Half of Those Repatriated are Going to Ningbo; For Example, on Monday, a total of 5,000 People Obtained Half-Price Certificates, With over a Thousand Going to Ningbo; Many Are also Returning to Shaoxing and Changzhou.

Guangdong's Repatriation Committee Sends Off the First Batch

The Guangdong Sojourners in Shanghai Committee for Repatriating Fellow Villagers to Their Native Place is an organization formed by representatives from over ten societies, including the Guangdong Native Place Association and the Guang Zhao Public Hall. It specializes in repatriating Guangdong refugees and unemployed individuals in Shanghai who lack the means to return to their hometowns. Since its establishment last month, the committee has worked tirelessly, planning everything in detail. It is reported that over 2,000 Guangdong residents have registered with the committee for free repatriation. The committee has now begun the repatriation process, with the first batch tentatively set at 200 people. With the assistance of the authorities, the Shandong Asia Shipping Company's Tainan Maru has been designated to transport them. The ship is currently on its way from Qingdao to Shanghai and will depart for Guangdong on the 27th. The committee has already issued a notice to the first batch of fellow villagers awaiting repatriation. It is also reported that among the first batch of repatriates, over 30 people are paying their own way, while the rest are free of charge and subsidized by the committee.

Convenient Transfer for Wenzhou Natives

The Ningbo, Fenghua, Xiangshan, Shaoxing, and Wenzhou Native Place Associations in Shanghai previously established offices to assist the municipal authorities in dispersing fellow villagers back to their native places, issuing return-to-hometown certificates and half-price travel vouchers. Recently, due to the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession's decision to cancel the half-price travel arrangement starting next month (May 1st), the number of people going to these native place associations to apply for return-to-hometown certificates and half-price vouchers has increased again. It is reported that among these native place associations, the Ningbo and Shaoxing Native Place Associations have issued the most return-to-hometown certificates, followed by the Wenzhou and Fenghua Native Place Associations, and then the Xiangshan Native Place Association. It has come to light that Wenzhou travelers find it quite convenient to transfer via Ningbo, Jinhua, and other places to return to their native place, without facing any difficulties. However, the travel expenses are slightly higher, and it is not advisable to carry too much luggage. Furthermore, the Wenzhou Native Place Association in Shanghai previously requested the SMC to allocate ships to send fellow villagers back to their native place. Recently, it has been heard that although negotiations have taken place several times regarding the allocation of ships, there is still no definite progress.

### Overseas Mail; International Red Cross Has Not Yet Started Receiving; Will Start Receiving After Specially Made Postcards Arrive in Shanghai

According to the "Shanghai Times," yesterday (the 21st), it was learned from Mr. Egger, the representative of the International Red Cross in Shanghai, that the association will start receiving letters from civilians in this city to be forwarded to civilians in Europe, America, the Philippines, and Australia as soon as Shanghai receives the necessary blank stationery supplied by the Japanese Red Cross. At present, it is not yet receiving such letters, as only letters written on this blank stationery can be forwarded. When the stationery arrives in Shanghai, the association will announce it to the press. The letters to be forwarded must be written in English, with each letter, including the addresses of the recipient and sender, not exceeding twenty-five words. The forwarding of each letter will depend on the postal routes that can be obtained. The current accessible postal route is via Siberia, Tbilisi, and Turkey to Geneva. Each letter may be charged a small postage fee, as the mail needs to be shipped out from Geneva in batches. The possibility of entrusting the mail to the repatriated foreign nationals ships scheduled to leave Shanghai at the end of May is also being considered.

### Swiss Consulate Urges Registration for Evacuation

According to the English-language "Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury," the Swiss Consul-General in Shanghai issued a notice the day before yesterday, urging British, American, and Dutch nationals who wish to evacuate but have not yet registered to do so at the designated locations as soon as possible. When registering, those who intend to evacuate must provide their name, the names of their family members, nationality, passport details, age, gender, occupation, length of stay in China, residential address, work address, and telephone number. The registration offices in the Shanghai area are the American Association at Room 602, No. 113 Jiujiang Road for American nationals; the British Association at No. 243 Jiujiang Road for British nationals; and the Dutch Emergency Committee at No. 1594 Avenue Joffre for Dutch nationals. In the Guangzhou area, there is the Swiss Consul in Shamian; in Tianjin, the Swiss Consul in Tianjin; in Hankou, Mr. Xiao Qu, the representative of the Swiss Consul in Hankou; in Qingdao, Mr. Ai Guo, the consular representative in Qingdao; and in Beijing, Mr. Dian Bili, the representative of the Swiss Consul in Beijing. The negotiations between the governments of the countries concerned regarding the exchange and evacuation of these nationals have not yet been finalized. Therefore, there is no guarantee at this time that the nationals who have already registered will be able to evacuate when the time comes. However, in order to make the necessary arrangements, registration must be completed as soon as possible.

### Western Medicine Prices Soar; Many Cases of Counterfeiting Discovered; Peddlers Selling Fake Medicine Arrested; Fake Bayer Anti-Malaria Tablets Found

Since the source of Western medicine in this city was cut off, prices have soared, making it a target for speculators. Whether experts or laymen, they are hoarding and profiteering, selling at high prices and making huge profits in a short period of time. Even more unscrupulous individuals are taking the opportunity to counterfeit Western medicine, either adulterating it with impurities or faking trademarks, in an attempt to deceive the public and disregard the lives of patients. There have been several cases reported to the police after being discovered by others. In addition to the French-made "Da Jian Feng" lung medicine, where the counterfeit medicine manufacturing organization was already cracked down on and found to be fake, two recent cases of counterfeiting German Bayer pharmaceutical products have occurred. The details are recorded as follows:

Western Medicine Peddlers Selling Inferior Drugs

The Shanghai Municipal Council (SMC) Police Department has recently been intensifying its investigation into those who spread counterfeit drugs. The day before yesterday, police officers arrested a Western medicine peddler, Mr. Xu, who had sold a counterfeit intravenous injection, impersonating Trypafavin manufactured by Bayer, to Yuyuan Pharmacy on Yuyuan Road for 400 yuan per bottle. The chemical analysis of this counterfeit medicine revealed that 80 to 85 percent of its contents were wheat starch, 15 to 20 percent were antimony dye, and there were also traces of Trypaflavin. According to experts, this counterfeit drug is sufficient to endanger human life, and its danger is even greater because it must be administered to patients intravenously. The police authorities have warned the public not to sell this inferior drug.

Doctor Reports and Verifies Counterfeiting

Previously, Bayer received a report on the 13th of this month from a Chinese doctor, stating that a peddler had offered to sell him a bottle containing 25cc of Trypaflavin. However, the liquid was very different from that sold by the Bayer Pharmaceutical Company. After chemical analysis, it was clearly determined to be counterfeit. The doctor then reported it to the police, and Inspector Brackley of the Central Police Station arrested the peddler. After questioning, it was learned that the peddler had also sold the same counterfeit drug to Yuyuan Pharmacy. The police are currently continuing to investigate the extent of the sale of this counterfeit drug in order to determine the scope of the fraud.

Severe Punishment for Endangering Human Life

At the same time, a man named Zhang Houfu (transliteration) counterfeited Bayer's Plasmoquine anti-malaria tablets and sold them to Berlin Pharmacy. This case has now been concluded, and the defendant has been sentenced to four months in prison. After purchasing counterfeit anti-malaria tablets, an employee of Berlin Pharmacy reported it to the Laozao Police Station, which arrested the suspect on March 2nd. The tablets were then chemically analyzed and found to be counterfeit. The Bayer Pharmaceutical Company then filed a lawsuit against him for counterfeiting. After interrogation, the suspect confessed to taking half of the genuine medicine from a bottle and replacing it with other tablets. He claimed to be unaware of the danger of the replaced tablets. The court found him guilty and sentenced him to four months in prison. Therefore, those who sell counterfeit drugs are warned that if such incidents endangering human life occur again, they will be severely punished without leniency.

### Police Department Urges Submission of Household Investigation Forms

The Police Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council (SMC) of the Public Concession, in order to implement the baojia system, began conducting a household census within the concession on March 15th of this year to issue citizen certificates at the beginning of next month. However, most citizens have not filled out the household investigation forms immediately. Therefore, it is hoped that all citizens will fill out the household forms truthfully as soon as possible and return them to the local police station as the basis for issuing citizen certificates.

### Rice Shops in Both Concessions Supplied Rice from Both Warehouses Yesterday

The Municipal Council Rice and Grain Office yesterday continued to designate the Swire Bund Warehouse in the French Concession and the Zhejiang Xingye Machinery Warehouse on North Suzhou Road as locations for rice shops to obtain rice to supply to the Lingxian neighborhoods this Saturday. The amount of rice allocated each time continued to increase, ranging from five to fifty bags. The supply has become smoother. The situation of rice shops obtaining rice yesterday was quite good. Although the amount was still limited to one "sheng" per person, sold at 2.90 yuan in national currency, the time was extended from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m., with continuous sales. The crowds of buyers were lined up and numbered by police officers. The lines were quite long, but those who were numbered could all buy rice and would not be turned away. The situation has greatly eased. The Municipal Council has stipulated that rice shops can obtain rice from warehouses on Sundays, because since rice warehouses stopped supplying rice on Sundays, rice shops could not sell rice universally on Mondays. Therefore, the situation of obtaining rice will definitely improve starting next week. As for the corn that the rice shops have been extracting from the Lihe Warehouse on Suzhou Road since this Tuesday, it has already been extracted and can be sold to the public tomorrow (Friday).

### Three Grenade Throwers Captured by Dixwell Road Self-Defense Corps

(Allied News Agency, this city) At 8:20 p.m. on the 21st, three hand grenades were suddenly thrown at a Chinese residence on Dixwell Road, Hongkou District. Only one grenade exploded, and there were no casualties. All three perpetrators were captured by members of the self-defense corps and military police. At 8:20 p.m. that afternoon, three thugs, each carrying hand grenades, attempted to throw them at a Chinese residence on Dongyang Street and then escape. One grenade fell and exploded in the street, while another did not explode. When the Chinese Self-Defense Corps of the Sixth District of Dixwell Road heard the explosion, they rushed to the scene and saw the thugs trying to escape. They shouted loudly and pursued them closely. Soon, the Chinese Self-Defense Corps of Xingjiazhai Road and the Japanese Self-Defense Corps of Shiqing Road received the news and also mobilized to assist in the roundup. The three thugs were then captured by members of the Japanese Self-Defense Corps. Another person was captured by the Japanese military police. Since the organization of the baojia system, this is the second time that the self-defense corps has captured thugs. The authorities awarded each of the three self-defense corps members who exerted themselves to pursue and capture the thugs with a bonus to encourage them. The Japanese Naval Garrison Command also issued a statement saying that the Chinese Self-Defense Corps discovered the thugs, and the Chinese and Japanese Self-Defense Corps cooperated to arrest them. They also actively cooperated during the interrogation, which is very gratifying. Since the organization of the baojia system, its effectiveness has been demonstrated. It is hoped that the self-defense corps will continue to cooperate actively in the future to prevent terrorists from finding any opportunity.

### Shanghai Municipal Council Health Department Health Report for March

According to the report of the Director of the Health Department of the Municipal Council, the major events in the field of health last month were the 61 cases of typhus. This disease is caused by poverty, filth, and infrequent changing of clothes. The months of May and June usually see the highest number of cases of this disease, so it may reach epidemic proportions in the near future. The transmission of this disease is usually due to the transmission of lice on the human body. Under certain circumstances, rat fleas are also a medium for spreading this disease. The preventive measures are nothing more than two: one is personal hygiene, and the other is avoiding contact with people with lice. Last month, there were 166 births of foreigners, of which 154 were residents within the concession (94 boys and 60 girls), with a birth rate of 32.19 per thousand. Among the births of residents within the concession, 134 were Japanese. There were 1,429 births of Chinese people, of which 1,373 were residents within the concession (726 boys and 647 girls). There were 97 deaths of foreigners, of which 9 were German Jewish refugees, and 37 were Asians other than Chinese (33 Japanese and 4 Indians), with a death rate of 20.27 per thousand. The most important causes of death were tuberculosis, heart disease, and pneumonia. There were 3,292 deaths of Chinese people, of which 2,041 were exposed corpses. There were 417 deaths of Chinese people due to infectious diseases. Other deaths were mostly due to tuberculosis, typhoid fever, and old age. There were more infectious diseases in March than in February. Among the 61 cases of typhus (20 foreigners and 41 Chinese), there were 8 deaths. In February, there were only 36 cases of this disease, with 7 deaths. There were 324 cases of tuberculosis in March, compared to only 235 in February. Other diseases such as dysentery, relapsing fever, and malaria were slightly more prevalent in March than in February. The pathology laboratory conducted 2,512 chemical analyses last month, including 342 blood serum samples for Gans and Wassermann tests. A total of 74 water and ice samples were chemically analyzed. 69 milk and ice cream samples were chemically analyzed to verify whether they met local standards. 68 people who were bitten by rabid dogs went to seek treatment, of which 56 lived within the concession and 9 came from outside the concession. The amount of injection serum distributed was 39,980 cc for cholera prevention injections, 186 cc for typhoid and paratyphoid injections, and 179,870 cc for smallpox vaccine. A total of 169 new cases of infectious diseases were discovered as a result of chemical analyses. Regarding school medical affairs, the percentage of students in the council's schools who were absent due to illness last month was 2.61%. This was 7.21% lower in foreign schools compared to February. Chinese middle and primary schools were 0.59% and 4.56% higher compared to February. A total of 184 students in the council's schools were found or reported to have other infectious diseases last month, mostly acute conjunctivitis. Last month, the accounting department sent poor students with physical defects studying in the council's Chinese primary schools to two hospitals subsidized by the council for treatment. It is recommended that this plan be implemented to the authorities. In the seven Chinese primary and middle schools run by the council, school nurses held individual talks on personal hygiene last month. School nurses made home visits to 549 absent students to find out what illness they were suffering from and other reasons for their absence. As a result, 121 cases of infectious diseases were discovered, and 10 cases were suspected of having infectious diseases. 75 students with physical defects were cured last month, and 216 were still under treatment. Personnel from the school inspection section made 230 inspections of assisted schools. Regarding the sanitation section, 61,167 people were vaccinated against smallpox last month, 26,024 people were vaccinated against cholera, and 1,384 exposed corpses were cremated. A total of 59,890 cubic feet of mosquito breeding grounds in the eastern and western districts were filled.

### Notice from the Postal Administration: All Items Must Clearly Indicate Address and Name

Henceforth, all types of mail, whether registered or not, must have the sender's name and address clearly marked before mailing; otherwise, it will result in delays or detention. This is a notice to inform the public. Signed, Director Zha Peilin, April 20th.

### Comparison of Prices Five Years Ago

The following table records the cost of living five years ago. At that time, the cost of living was low. One yuan of legal tender could be exchanged for 300 copper coins (10-wen denomination) or 100 copper coins (1-fen denomination). Most prices were denominated in 10-wen copper coins, and 1-fen copper coins were also sometimes used. Compared to the second half of the year, after the outbreak of the Shanghai War, the prices of goods that were inconvenient to transport, such as white rice, increased slightly, rising to around 20 yuan per "shi". Other prices did not increase. Moreover, wealthy merchants in Shanghai mostly sought refuge in other places. Therefore, in 1938, the prices of some goods actually fell due to sluggish sales. By May 1939, the first panic occurred when shops in the market lacked 1-fen copper coins for change. Some unscrupulous merchants, seeing the price of copper rise, collected copper coins, melted them into copper bars, and sold them for profit. Later, the shops used stamps for change. However, at this time, prices had already risen slightly. After August, Shanghai was peaceful, and merchants who had sought refuge in other places returned to Shanghai one after another. As a result, the black market exchange became active, and various prices began to rise. At that time, 1-fen and 5-fen copper-nickel coins had disappeared from the market, and 1-fen and 5-fen red and green banknotes were issued instead. Retail prices increased invisibly, and the cost of living for the people also increased daily. In September 1940, the European war broke out, and Western medicine was the first to rise in price. Daily necessities made from imported raw materials also rose in price. In 1941, prices rose all the way up, with small corrections. Speculators were active in the black market, disregarding everything, hoarding goods and refusing to sell them. For example, the price of foreign rice rose from more than 20 yuan per bag to 140 or 150 yuan. The prices of other daily necessities also rose. Later, the authorities imposed price controls, and prices stabilized slightly, but the black market was very active, and the secret prices rose without limit. And now, in 1942, with the discount on new and old banknotes, prices have secretly increased by 30%, 40%, or 50%. Moreover, ordinary merchants are raising prices, depressing the value of the currency, to the point where one yuan of legal tender is only worth one or two fen, at most one jiao. Looking at the number of yuan equivalent in the table, if you look at the life of the salary class, the monthly income of one thousand yuan is not as well-off as the income of one hundred yuan five years ago, and each yuan is only worth five fen on average.

### China Relief Association Organizes Small-Scale Interest-Free Loans; Divided into Three Types; Strict Investigation to Prevent Abuse

In this island of hardship, since the people have difficulty making a living, returning to their hometowns is certainly one of the ways out. However, in fact, there are also those who, because they are from different provinces and transportation is difficult, are unable to make the trip for the time being. Or even if they can return to their hometowns, their livelihoods still cannot be resolved. It is not difficult to imagine the pitiful situation of these poor and helpless unemployed people.

Small Loans from the Relief Association

There are many charitable organizations in Shanghai that are engaged in relief work, but most of them have stopped operating due to lack of funds. Recently, the China Relief Association has organized small-scale loans, and since its implementation, there have been very enthusiastic applicants. However, there are still people who need loans but are not very clear about the procedures. The reporter specifically visited the association's Secretary-General Lan, who graciously received him and gave a detailed explanation of the procedures for small-scale loans and the current situation. It can indeed be regarded as good news for the unemployed on the island. Those who wish to engage in legitimate small-scale businesses but lack funds can apply for loans in accordance with the prescribed procedures and make reasonable use of them.

Send a Letter to Obtain a Registration Form

The China Relief Association is located at Room 656, Yishan Eldon Building, at the intersection of Sichuan Road and Jiangxi Road. Because the office is located high on the sixth floor, and there are many offices in the building, it may be inconvenient to maintain order if too many loan applicants crowd together. Therefore, borrowers must first send a letter to obtain a registration form, fill in their name, age, native place, gender, occupation, address, amount applied for, purpose of the loan, guarantor or guarantor's name and address, etc. After the association sends someone to investigate and verify the information, a loan agreement can be issued, and the applicant will then be notified in writing to come to the association to complete the procedures.

Repay in Installments Without Interest

The association stipulates that it will receive a certain number of people every day, which can avoid the disadvantage of crowding. The amount of the loan is tentatively set at three types: 60 yuan, 80 yuan, and 100 yuan, without interest or any fees. The method of repayment is that after two months from the date of receipt of the loan, one-fifth will be repaid each month, and the loan will be repaid in five installments. After the loan has been repaid in full, it can be applied for again. However, if the borrower is unable to repay on time, or if they obtain the loan but do not operate a business, after verification, the guarantor must be responsible for repaying the loan in their place, in order to prevent abuse and maintain the circulation of funds.

Actively Use Legitimate Methods

The association hopes that small loans will have considerable benefits and make them widespread and lasting. It is very willing to provide economic assistance to those who are unemployed or engaged in small-scale businesses and feel that they lack funds, so that they can still find a "way to make money" in this severe period of life, so as to avoid hunger and displacement or other unfortunate tragedies. Currently, there are dozens of letters applying for loans every day. The association's staff are working busily and sending people out to conduct thorough investigations. They are handling matters very seriously, striving to ensure that everyone who borrows can actively use the borrowed funds in a legitimate way. Most Borrowers are Vendors; According to the structure, most of the borrowers are engaged in the business of "According to the stalls, most of them sell bread or flatbreads, followed by fruits and sweets, and then by selling newspapers or old books. Although they work hard all day long, they can't talk about making any great progress. However, small-scale businesses are originally only about making small profits for a living, and they shouldn't have any extravagant hopes. Moreover, relying on one's own efforts to make a living is much better than depending on others or sitting and waiting to die. If you can repay on time every time without losing credit, you will surely gain the sympathy of society and receive more powerful assistance.

Enthusiastic People Should Urge Promotion

Originally, helping others and sympathizing with the weak is also human nature. Besides the China Relief Association, in such a large Shanghai, there are other enthusiastic public-spirited individuals or organizations willing to provide assistance to the poor and unemployed. This all depends on those who have the ambition and perseverance to make a living in a legitimate way, to be able to do well for themselves and make good use of these opportunities.

### Epidemic Fever in Shanghai (1)

— Doctor Hu Qipeng

The renowned physician Dr. Hu Qipeng has been practicing medicine for many years and enjoys a high reputation. Dr. Hu once presided over health administration. Based on his practical experience, he deeply understands the harm of epidemic fever in this city and the importance of public health. In response to our newspaper's request, he wrote this article, which presents a systematic account of epidemic diseases and elaborates on treatment and prevention in particular. Readers who study it carefully will surely benefit greatly in terms of personal health and public hygiene. - Reporter

In recent years, this city has been affected by the war, resulting in a sudden increase in population and overcrowding, which has led to a deterioration in sanitation. Due to the hardship of life, it is even more difficult to pay attention to how to live and eat in a hygienic manner. Those responsible for public health are also largely facing difficult circumstances. They have been unable to improve and perfect all facilities related to the health of citizens, resulting in piles of garbage everywhere that are not cleaned up in time, and corpses lying in the streets that cannot be collected and buried quickly. Filth and stench fill the entire city. In addition, the number of poor people is increasing, fleas and lice are breeding, and various infectious diseases are spreading. Diseases that were not supposed to be seen in the past have become epidemic in recent years. They spread very quickly in a short period of time. The physical and mental suffering of the patients is beyond description, and the loss of business and economy is particularly costly. The impact on the country and society is even greater. At a time when the cost of living is increasing day by day, and it is difficult to make ends meet by saving on food and clothing, if one suffers from illness, the cost of medical treatment is even more difficult to raise. Therefore, based on the statistics of infectious diseases from the Health Temple of the Public Concession and the Health Department of the French Municipal Council, I have selected the important acute infectious diseases in this city in recent years and the epidemic fever that has been found since the beginning of spring this year. I will briefly describe their pathogenesis, symptoms, treatment, and prevention methods, in order to attract the attention of all sectors of society. For those who have not been infected, how to prevent it to avoid the occurrence of a severe epidemic; for those who have been infected, how to make an early diagnosis and how to provide appropriate treatment, so as not to blindly use medicine and delay treatment and increase the number of deaths. The following is a brief description:

Excerpts from the Annual Statistics of Acute Infectious Diseases in this City from the Health Department of the French Municipal Council from the Republic of China Years 26 to 30.

Excerpts from the Annual Statistics of Acute Infectious Diseases in this City from the Health Department of the Public Concession from the Republic of China Years 26 to 30.

1. Dengue Fever

This disease is originally an epidemic acute infectious disease in hot regions and their vicinity. It was rarely heard of in this city before the war. Since the epidemic of this disease was discovered in the Republic of China Year 28, the number of residents infected was so large that it was once called Shanghai disease. In fact, this disease has had severe epidemics in Guangdong, Fujian, Zhejiang, and other provinces in our country. It is not a local disease that occurs exclusively in this city. Because it was a rare disease in this city in the past, medical colleagues have paid little attention to this disease over the years; it is also missing from the infectious disease statistics table of the Public Concession Health Department. However, in recent years, this disease has become one of the important epidemic fevers in this city.

Pathogen

The spread of this disease is mainly due to Aedes aegypti and yellow fever mosquitoes, but the pathogenic microorganisms have not yet been identified. It is only known that it is a virus that can pass through filters. Symptoms The onset is sudden. At first, there are chills, and then the body temperature gradually rises, even reaching 40.5 to 41 degrees Celsius. Rashes appear on the third or fourth day of the disease, starting on the back of the hands and feet, and then spreading upward from the limbs, even affecting the chest, back, torso, and entire face. At the same time, it also shows the same symptoms as other febrile diseases, such as a coated tongue, short and thick urine, high fever, delirium, and loss of appetite. However, the special symptoms of this disease are that the patient complains of severe pain in the waist, back, and limbs. The headache is limited to the eye sockets or appears behind the head. Furthermore, the muscles all over the body are painful to the touch. Because the pain is so severe, it is also called "breakbone fever." The course of the disease lasts about seven or eight days before entering the recovery period. It rarely lasts for more than two weeks. This disease is extremely contagious. If there are no other complications, there is no danger to life.

Prevention

This disease is spread by mosquitoes, so all methods of killing mosquitoes and avoiding mosquitoes should be regarded as essential. It is also necessary to prevent patients from being bitten by mosquitoes in order to stop the source of transmission.

### Government Bonds Surge After Sharp Decline - Maximum Rise of 4 Yuan 1, Minimum Rise of 2 Yuan 1

The grey market for government bonds experienced a very large rebound yesterday, with a strong surge in prices and a tense market atmosphere. Because the news from last Saturday has been confirmed by various newspapers, the domestic war situation is more favorable. The tight money supply suddenly eased at this time, and the discount rate also dropped sharply. Suddenly, there were buyers representing the financial community in the market, which led to short covering and increased bullish positions. Transactions surged, and the sale of 300,000 to 400,000 yuan by Tongkang was like trying to stop boiling water with a ladle. Market prices rose all the way, and buying interest was very strong. Type A bonds have risen by more than 4 yuan. Although there is no saying of a price limit, the market stipulates that price increases and decreases are also limited to 4 yuan. The depressed atmosphere that had been suffering from various blows for many days was swept away. Bulls took the opportunity to put pressure on the market, but the sellers were at the end of their rope, so market prices soared. This is the same principle as seeing the retreat of the weak and the rapid advance of the strong. Bulls are concentrated on Type C bonds. If there is no large outflow of spot goods in the future, market prices may continue to advance. The most eager buyers are Tongshun and Hongxing, followed by Tongli, Xiekang, and Hengyu. Others with transactions of 30,000 to 50,000 yuan, such as Lianyi, Yichang, Jiufeng, Shunli, Qianyi, Lianhe, Gongmao, and Longkang, also bought in. Tongkang sold the most, and others such as Dechang, Hongda, Runde, Lemao, Yongkang, Xinji, Shuntai, Xinhua, and small retail investors took advantage of the high prices to sell. As a result, market prices rebounded strongly across the board, with increases ranging from 2 yuan 1 jiao to 4 yuan 1 jiao. Transactions amounted to approximately 1.12 million yuan. A concise table is listed below:

Category | Highest | Lowest | Closing | Change from Previous Day
------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | --------
Unified A | 69.60 | 66.80 | 69.00 | Up 4.10
Unified B | 63.50 | 60.10 | 63.40 | Up 3.70
Unified C | 62.10 | 59.70 | 62.10 | Up 3.10
Unified D | 56.50 | 54.00 | 56.50 | Up 3.40
Unified E | 58.00 | 56.00 | 58.00 | Up 3.00

### National Rice Falls Sharply After Rising Greatly - But the Rice Price of Around 500 Yuan is Still Too High

The national rice market, which has prices but no sales, although there are no definite price quotations, the rumored prices have been rising day by day. Since the price suddenly soared some time ago, it broke through the 500 yuan mark. Early and late rice reached 505 yuan and 500 yuan in the French Concession, and directly hit around 530 yuan in the British Concession. Yesterday, it was rumored that ordinary consumers finally felt that the price was too high and difficult to handle, and had no intention of buying. Although the peddlers in the suburbs were unusually sparse, the price increase was still a dream. Moreover, the goods were easily changed due to the sultry weather, and it was difficult to delay the sale. Since there was no demand, the original intention was changed, and they were afraid that it would be too late to sell. As a result of the price reduction, early and late rice in the French Concession fell to 490 yuan, 487 yuan, and 485 yuan. In the British Concession, it fell to 510 yuan to 505 yuan. Compared with the previous day, it plunged by 10 to 20 yuan. However, this kind of sudden change is only a rumor, and there is no standard in the market at all.

### Scattered Transactions of Miscellaneous Grains

Yesterday's transactions of miscellaneous grains were mostly scattered. Because rice prices fell and there were rumors of hope for regulating food for the people, people's minds were slightly at ease, and prices were stable with little change. 50 bags of Pudong broad beans were sold for 237 yuan, 30 bags of Jiangbei green beans were sold for 225 yuan, 50 bags of Benniu red beans were sold for 204 yuan in cash, over 100 bags of Chongming sand red beans were sold for 232 yuan, and 229 yuan delivered, self-delivery, 200 bags of Wuhu corn were sold for 147 yuan in cash, 148.5 yuan with commission, Shenji soybean cake 5,000 pieces, old warehouse order for May flour 49.4 yuan, old warehouse order for June 50.01 yuan, old warehouse order for November 52 yuan to 51.5 yuan, new warehouse order for April 47.5 yuan to 46.6 yuan.

### Cash Appears at a New High Price - Tianjin Merchants Return, Market Turns Flat

The grey market for cash saw a sharp rise followed by a sudden drop. The price has broken out of the 20,000 yuan mark, breaking the all-time high of 20,700 yuan on March 13th, and reaching an unprecedented peak of 21,400 yuan. This is due to the momentum of the previous day. Unexpectedly, the large Tianjin merchants felt that there was no need to smuggle goods to Tianjin at the current high prices, so they returned to sell, causing the market to turn from strong to stable. People's minds were quite uncertain. The opening price in the morning was 1,200 yuan higher, at 20,700 yuan. Suddenly, sellers were hoarding goods, and silver shops, cash numbers, and securities firms were competing to buy in. Wealthy people were particularly eager to buy and store them. The market price soared again by 700 yuan, reaching a high price of 21,400 yuan. Suddenly, another cash firm came to sell, and the securities firm sold on behalf of the Tianjin merchants. Near noon, it gradually dropped to 20,700 yuan. At noon, there were buyers at 20,800 yuan, which was 1,300 yuan higher than the previous day, with a difference of 700 yuan. The price of gold per tael for silver shops and jewelry stores increased again by 150 yuan, to a high price of 2,200 yuan (200 yuan discount for buying back). Silver was priced at 18 yuan. The black market price rose again to around 14 yuan. The money industry association discount rate increased by 2 cents to 1 jiao 3 cents. The discount rate for exchange drafts was a minimum of 7 yuan, and finally remained at 10 yuan, the same as the previous day.

### Shortage of Single Notes - Even Damaged Ones are Refused

Currently, there is a severe shortage of 1 yuan notes in this city. In addition, most people refuse to accept slightly damaged ones, which makes it even more difficult for them to circulate, resulting in a discount. The highest discount is as high as 10 yuan. It has been learned that silver and money shops have always accepted slightly damaged 1 yuan notes and have not changed their policy. People should not refuse to accept them, so that they can circulate smoothly and the discount can be expected to disappear invisibly. Since the price of goods has soared, the use of single yuan notes has gradually declined. Is it because of the lack of single notes that rice shops cannot use them to pay for rice, or is it because they are absorbing a large number of single notes, which further reduces the circulation of single notes in the market? Some people are taking advantage of this to manipulate and hoard them. In addition, smoke shops have recently been buying 1 yuan notes, with a premium of as much as 20 yuan. As a result, these notes are rarely seen. The large-scale collection of single notes is one of the reasons for the current shortage of single notes.

### Gold Pounds Rise by 10 Yuan

Yesterday, in the foreign exchange market, British and American gold pounds each rose by 10 yuan. The former was at 470 yuan and the latter was at 480 yuan. American dollar notes rose again to 36 yuan. Hong Kong notes continued to rise to 5 yuan, with a 1 jiao discount for large notes. Military notes opened in the morning at 7 yuan 3 jiao 3 fen, and then fell slightly to 7 jiao 5 fen. The result was similar to the previous day.

### Sighing at Coal Briquettes - Hating the Ineffectiveness of the Stove Fire

Since coal briquettes soared by 10 yuan per dan, prices have risen higher and higher, and the quality has deteriorated. Users are dissatisfied throughout the city. However, due to the lack of goods, they have to endure the pain and seek them. They can only sigh at the coal briquettes and hate the ineffectiveness of the stove fire. Recently, coal briquettes sold directly by factories to registered households are sold for 29 yuan with some courtesy, and mostly sold at the set price of 30 yuan. Furthermore, they charge an additional 1 yuan per dan for the permit fee on top of the selling price. This is the official market price. If you want coal briquettes that burn well and have stronger firepower, you have to spend 35 or 6 yuan, or even 40 yuan. However, coal shops also sell coal briquettes with low firepower, and unscrupulous sellers take advantage of the lack of supply to sell them for 36 or 7 yuan.

### Cotton Merchants Change to Hoarding Cotton Yarn - Suspected Intention to Indirectly Raise Cotton Prices

The cotton yarn market is experiencing a strong surge in prices. This is because raw materials are expensive, so people's minds are firm. The clothiers are unanimously buying up existing yarn. It is speculated that their intention is to indirectly raise cotton prices. As a result, the foundation is getting tighter and tighter, and the market is gradually moving forward. 42 count Lanfeng was at 13,350 yuan to 12,000 yuan, with a closing price of 13,000 yuan. 42 count Shuiyue was at 12,600 yuan. 42 count Xiantao was at 12,600 yuan. 60 count Riguang was at 13,350 yuan. 40 count Riguang was at 11,800 yuan. 20 count Yueqin was at 6,250 yuan. 20 count Lanfeng was at 6,850 yuan. 20 count Shuiyue was at 6,390 yuan. 20 count Shuangma was at 5,850 yuan to 6,000 yuan. 20 count Shuangdiqiu was at 5,950 yuan to 6,050 yuan. 10 count Hongshuangma was at 4,600 yuan to 4,750 yuan. 10 count Tongzijun was at 4,600 yuan to 4,620 yuan. 10 count Zhinv was at 4,700 yuan. 6 count Hongshi was at 4,600 yuan. 6 count Xiongfeng was at 5,850 yuan. 10 count Hongbao was at 4,500 yuan. 10 count Shuangdiqiu was at 4,350 yuan. The initial price of the factory order for 20 count Shuangma was 4,900 yuan. After opening high, it fell directly to 4,820 yuan. However, buyers were still eager, and it rose again to 4,940 yuan. At this time, the fluctuation time was quite long. Near the close, the price surge resumed, breaking through the 5,000 yuan mark to 5,050 yuan. By the time of closing, it was slightly flat, at 5,000 yuan exactly, without actual sales.

### Cloth Prices Soar Without Actual Sales

Factory Cloth: Yesterday, the cloth market saw soaring yarn prices. Although there were no actual customer sales, a large number of hoarders were only buying in and not selling out. As a result, prices were pulled higher and higher without limit. 16 pound Shuangxiang coarse cloth spot goods were at 280 yuan, the same pound Feihong was at 240 yuan, and Diqiu was at 250 yuan. 8 pound Zhenzhong was at 125 yuan. 12 pound Diqiu fine cloth was at 225 yuan, Dapeng was at 230 yuan, and Fugui was at 215 yuan. Fugui fine twill was at 190 yuan. Chuji shilin was at 340 yuan. Changshou fouchou was at 7.2 yuan, Wanbenli was at 7.35 yuan, and Xintiao was at 7.3 yuan. In the later market, East Piece continued to rise, and the shouted prices were even more chaotic. East Cloth: The speculative hoarders in the market were crazy. Each cloth saw an astonishing price surge again. The new order for 12 pound Longtou fine cloth opened in the morning at 255.5 yuan, rose to 260 yuan in the afternoon, started at 65 yuan in the afternoon, and rose sharply to 270 yuan. Later, due to the sale by those who made profits, it returned to 266 yuan for the evening closing, a huge increase of 12.5 yuan per piece. The red warehouse order for Sijunzi Serge rose even faster, with the evening closing at 8.93 yuan, a wild increase of 0.989 yuan per yard. However, the closing price of the bank warehouse order for the same material was only 7.7 yuan, and there were no takers, a difference of 1.23 yuan per yard. Alas, the blind following of speculators can be seen here.

### Toon Sprouts Offered as New

The first two batches of new toon sprouts have arrived in Shanghai. There are only dozens of pieces in total. The goods are still good, and they are offered as new for the first time, so the price is also high. The market price yesterday was 800 yuan, and the trend is stable and elegant.

### Zhangzhou Longan Production Area in Short Supply

Due to the scarce arrival of goods and lack of inventory in the market, the price of Zhangzhou longan has already increased. Yesterday, another few hundred boxes were opened, and the price rose by another 10 to 20 yuan. It is heard that the goods in the production area are also limited, and the market is expected to stand firm.

### Is it Possible for the Dead to be Resurrected?

— Stone

Can science devise a method to resurrect the dead—and continue to live? Recent results in this area tell us that this miracle will become a daily occurrence in the near future. Considerable success has been achieved with experiments on fish and animals. Creatures whose souls have returned to heaven have been able to move, breathe, and live after a certain operation.

Partial success has also been achieved with these experiments on humans. Men and women who were practically dead from a scientific and medical point of view have been successively revived and lived for a considerable time—one of whom, once thought to be dead, is still alive today.

However, in most cases, the period of resurrection is only a matter of time. For example, a seven-year-old boy in Portsmouth, England, died as a result of anesthesia administered during an operation. The doctor opened the walls of his abdomen and diaphragm and massaged his heart, and the patient began to breathe again. Unfortunately, this state lasted only twelve hours.

Greater success was achieved in treating an old woman in Ettington. She also died during surgery, but after cardiac massage and stimulation, she began to breathe and lived for nineteen hours.

But a woman in Sheffield went to the West after having two dozen teeth extracted, and then returned to the world. According to a record in a British medical journal, an anesthetic was injected before the extraction, and the patient suddenly turned pale, the pupils dilated, and the pulse and heart stopped beating. All treatments, such as artificial respiration, gallbladder pressing, and injections of cardiac stimulants, were ineffective. As a last resort, a certain drug was injected into her.

Seven minutes after death, she showed the first signs of awakening. A few minutes later, she had completely returned to normal, and the doctor allowed the dentist to extract two dozen teeth according to the original procedure.

This is a rare opportunity for scientists to explore those who have had actual death experiences. But the results disappointed them because the woman was completely unaware of all the efforts to save her and could not recall the excitement or feelings she had experienced at that time.

Somewhere in England, a man suffered from the most serious heart disease. He was a doomed man—his death was beyond saving. But a surgeon decided to risk a major operation. He would never have attempted this if the patient had any hope of recovery. In fact, it was only a one-in-a-million chance.

Cellular tissue cut from another part of the body was connected to the heart itself. This previously untried surgery was a great success. Apart from the heart being too weak to perform strenuous work, he was no different from ordinary people. Although strictly speaking, he cannot be included in the group of people who have been resurrected after death, we can at least say that the surgery performed on him brought him back from the brink of death.

### Australian Fauna

— Dafen

Australia has a vast area, but a small population. Most of them are concentrated in the capital cities of the six states and major coastal cities. The natives are almost extinct, with only 50,000 to 60,000 remaining. But according to anthropologists, the Australian natives belong to the oldest ancestor of mankind.

Australia has a lot of sheep, more than ten times the population. Wool is Australia's main product, earning hundreds of millions a year. More than half of Australians rely on sheep for their livelihoods. Interestingly, the earliest sheep ranchers on the Australian continent shared the same surname as the commander-in-chief of the Allied Forces in the South Pacific today, also a MacArthur.

Australia's gold mines are very rich, which is why so many adventurers have been attracted to this continent. The largest gold nugget found is said to weigh six hundred pounds. Many overseas Chinese also came to dig for gold, initially gathering in "New Gold Mountain" (i.e., Melbourne). But later they changed to the hotel industry, laundry work, restaurants, etc.

Australia is mostly plains and deserts, with sparsely populated inland areas. The whole territory lacks mountain ranges and rivers. Drinking water in the inland areas was often a problem in the early days. Many adventurers died of thirst in the beginning.

The coastal land in Australia is very fertile, producing abundant wheat. Not only can it be self-sufficient, but it is also shipped to the British Isles and other places. The production of beef and butter is also very rich.

From this, we can see that Australia is not only a strategic location in military terms, but also very important in terms of economic resources.

### Challenging the God of Fate

— Huang Wenjin

The road of fate is like the Milky Way in the sky. There are many small stars in the middle that either gather or separate. Our mortal eyes cannot clearly recognize the true face of fate. Look at how white the snow is. It is just like our hearts when we were young children under the protection of our parents. But when people's footprints are imprinted on it, it can no longer be chaste and spotless. Fate is like this to people. It困厄 the wise people, but its rewards for them are very meager.

Sad friends, I want to offer you a piece of advice: "You must deal with any adversity!" No matter how tragic your fate is, you must struggle hard! You must not escape reality and destroy your life with bloody wine. If your situation is really bad, I believe it is definitely not as bad as you imagine. You think the current situation is extremely miserable because you had a rich and beautiful yesterday.

Some people will answer, yes, what you said is right, but I don't have the power to clear the haze in my heart. The recurrence of melancholy always comes unexpectedly like moss on a wet stone. Everyone knows that larvae are isolated and helpless in the nests of hungry ants. I am like this larva now! How can I not want to struggle? But to struggle requires courage, so I use wine to encourage myself. Although I know very well that it will numb my nerves and ruin my future, my life is like a useless puppet, not worth cherishing at all.

Then, my friend, you underestimate yourself too much. Disraeli once said: "The behavior of youth is erroneous, the behavior of middle age is competitive, and the behavior of old age is repentant." Whether old age should repent depends on the early stage. Middle age is the most precious time in life. If you are now in your prime, you should fight against this dark society. You cannot　seemingly cross the spring of your life and make a living in repentance.

Life is like seawater. The moment it rises is the freshest and cleanest. Dear friends, you should also roar up like seawater to obtain the freshest and cleanest page in your life!

### On Petroleum

— Yu Jingmei

Petroleum is commonly known as kerosene, kerosene, also known as crude oil, English name Mineral oil, rude petrolenmErdol, Petrolenm. The Supplement to the Compendium of Materia Medica calls it stone brain oil and lists it under the stone section. Dream Creek Essays says:　Yanzhi, Yan'an petroleum also; born on the waterfront, sand and stones mixed with springs, appearing indistinctly. Locals use pheasant tails　to dip into cans, it looks like paint, and it burns very brightly. The Commentary to the Book of Han says: South of Yanshou County there is a mountain stone that produces a spring, which sways like uncongealed grease and burns very brightly, but cannot be eaten; it is commonly called stone lacquer. Fangzhen Chronicle calls it land grease. The Supplement to the Compendium of Materia Medica says: Stone brain oil is produced in Yulin Prefecture, Yan'an, Shaanxi, etc. It is a liquid flowing from the stone, which locals extract. Yuanhe Chronicle states: The petroleum spring is 180 miles east of Yumen County. There is moss in the spring like fatty meat, which can be burned in place of candles. Pouring water on it makes the light even brighter, and extinguishing it with ash will put it out. According to petroleum, it belongs to the carbonaceous asphalt class and is an oily liquid mixture formed by the mixing of many carbonized　elements. The so-called crude oil is because it has not undergone washing procedures. Currently, the world's oil-producing provinces are headed by the United States, followed by the Soviet Union; however, the properties of the oil produced by these two countries are different. India, Japan, and other places also produce it. Petroleum has been discovered in various parts of China, among which Shaanxi, Gansu, Xinjiang, and Sichuan provinces are the most famous. Unfortunately, there is no large-scale operation.

### The Balance of Food

— Chen Cuipin

Most people only know that to maintain health, one must have sufficient nutrition, but they neglect the importance of balanced food. The so-called balanced food refers to that in all the food in our daily life, the food that causes acidity should account for 20%, while the food that causes　alkalinity should account for 80%. If the food that causes acidity exceeds 20%, it will hinder digestion and assimilation, pollute the blood, and　become acidosis, which is enough to endanger the health and development of the body.

Common foods that cause acidity include barley, white rice, white bread, dry cheese, all kinds of meat and gravy, eggs, lentils, oat flour,　corn, peanuts, walnuts, etc.

Foods that cause　alkalinity include almonds, apples, apricots, asparagus, bean sprouts, red　carrots, cucumbers, grapes, raisins, lemons, cauliflower, mustard chestnuts, cherries, cream, dates, figs,　radishes, onions, oranges, peaches, pears, potatoes, tomatoes, and various dairy products, etc.

### Success

— Tianshui

There has never been complete success, everything is in creation, we cannot see the end, we can only see the road

The point of success in life's struggle lies in fulfilling the greatest obligation

Those who want to succeed should keep their emotions calm and lower their expectations. —— George Eliot

### Philosophy

— Xiven

Philosophy begins with people's ability to doubt—especially to doubt their own beloved beliefs, their own claims, and their own principles and principles.

Durant

Philosophy is between poetry and science, closer to poetry. 　Yunaimi

Philosophy is not for oneself, it is for others——just like manners at mealtime. Hao Aiwan

### Sharing the Same Boat in Storms

— He Jiaji

(3)　Guest Arrives

Walking to the reception room on the east side, Weicheng put the shopping bag in Guofang's hand on the table and said, "How can anyone say for sure what will happen in this world? Who knew that when your brother and sister and I were talking on the boat, it was precisely when my late mother was critically ill. We were still dreaming happy dreams that night, dreams are so easy to wake up from, old man, I am still miserable after all." Guofang really felt sorry for Weicheng, her face was so serious that she couldn't find a trace of a smile. She wanted to pay her respects at the spirit of Madam Ye. Weicheng first said he didn't dare to accept it, and then said he would ask them to prepare. But Guofang had already taken off her coat and walked into the courtyard in three steps. Asking where the mourning hall was, Weicheng said: "In the hall." Axing went to open the door, He Zixing went to light incense, and Weicheng went to kneel in front of the filial piety screen. When Guofang stood in front of Madam Ye's portrait, bowing and bowing deeply, someone was already sobbing and wailing in the filial piety screen. Guofang looked at Madam Ye's portrait, and even if she was a heart of stone, her nose felt sore, and she couldn't help but shed tears from her eyes.

Weicheng accompanied Guofang back outside, and Guofang asked: "Who is crying?" Weicheng said: "She is my cousin, I will introduce you to her later. Many things in our family are taken care of by her, but unfortunately she is also a woman with bad luck." Guofang felt that there were too many things she wanted to ask Weicheng, and Weicheng also had such a feeling. But what Weicheng was especially eager to know was what illness Guoqi had. Guofang said: "My brother doesn't have any serious illness, he just drank too much on New Year's Eve, and the next day he had a cough, followed by a fever. My grandmother is superstitious, saying that on the first day of the new year, you can't see a doctor or take medicine, so she didn't take medicine until the second day. One day's delay made it difficult for him to recover. He knew I was coming, so he repeatedly told me to pick you up to Shuangqiao. He said it easily, to go by the same car and come back by the same car. I'm only allowed to have lunch here, and I have to pick you up to Shuangqiao for dinner tonight. I don't dare to force you now, you can tell me if you can go." (57)
