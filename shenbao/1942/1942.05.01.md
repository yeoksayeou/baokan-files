### India Gradually Moves Towards Constitutional Government; Significant Progress Achieved; Under-Secretary of State for India Delivers Speech; Special Envoy's Visit to India Not Entirely Unsuccessful

London, 29th, Havas - The Under-Secretary of State for India, the Duke of Devonshire, delivered a speech in the Upper House today, reporting on the difficulties encountered by Minister Cripps during his visit to India. He stated that the results of the visit proved that it was difficult to reach an agreement among Indian political leaders. The purpose of the visit was misunderstood by some, who viewed the British proposal as a sign of remorse due to difficulties encountered in India. In reality, it was the result of a consistent policy of the British Cabinet over many years. The special envoy received various demands from all sectors in India. The envoy's task was to determine whether these demands could be reconciled in order to decide India's future. How to divide the responsibilities of the Indian government and the British government was also a difficulty. In order to solve this difficulty, Sir Cripps invited Indian leaders to send one representative each to participate in the British War Cabinet and the Allied Pacific Supreme Military Conference. However, India demanded the division of powers between the General Staff and the Ministry of Defense, and the complete transfer of all political power to India. In fact, in this critical time, such a division of powers would only cause chaos in India during the war. Although Cripps' visit yielded some gains, the doubts in India and elsewhere have been dispelled. Some Indian politicians will surely learn a good lesson from this. Furthermore, the fact that both China and the United States have sent special envoys to India shows that India is gradually moving towards constitutional government and has achieved significant progress. In short, today's India is not in a static state but is always progressing. I believe that in the history of the Upper House, there has never been such a good opportunity to make this vast region a free, unified, and autonomous nation.

### Italy Denies Seeking Separate Peace

Rome, Havas, 29th - The Stefani News Agency recently issued a message stating that a message from British and American news agencies claimed that Italy was trying to seek a separate peace. This is purely fictitious and intended to spread smoke and cover up their true intentions. Britain and the United States are attempting to obtain this solution at the lowest cost, but the two countries should know that Italy's participation in the war was of its own free will, and in the future, it will continue to fight to the end against the united front of democratic countries, Jews, and Bolsheviks until complete victory is achieved. This determination is stronger than ever before.

### Only Localized Battles Within the Soviet Union; Soviet Forces Hold Their Original Positions; German Spring Offensive Proves Empty

Bern, 29th, Havas - Swiss newspapers report that a correspondent in Berlin stated that the German Army spokesman told reporters today that the German offensive may not be launched on the Eastern Front but may take other actions. The correspondent added that Führer Hitler also mentioned the Eastern Front offensive in his speech last Sunday and strongly stated that there would be decisive results. However, the Eastern Front offensive has not changed. Although there are some troop concentrations and continuous offensives at the front, they are localized in nature and not the decisive Spring Offensive.

Stockholm, 29th, Havas - The general situation on the Eastern Front yesterday was as follows:

In the north, fighting on the Finnish front was most intense in the Karelian Isthmus. The Red Army attacked near Louhi. In the center, on the Moscow front in the Smolensk area, German forces were active. In the past forty-eight hours, German infantry, under the cover of multiple tanks, launched several attacks and breached the Red Army's positions in one place. In the center, on the left flank of Moscow in the Bryansk area, the Red Army attacked from 15 miles north of the area. The Bryansk fortress may fall soon. In the south, in the Kharkov area, fighting, which had been quiet for two weeks, has become active again. The intense fighting on the Kerch Peninsula has been going on for three days, and the truth is unclear.

Berlin, 30th, Huitong News Agency - According to the German High Command, German aircraft attacked a port on the Black Sea coast of the Caucasus the day before yesterday, hitting factories near the station and airfield. Barracks were also bombed, and two medium-sized merchant ships were heavily damaged. The port of Kerch was also bombed.

### Strict Prohibition of Manipulating Small Denomination Notes; Ministry of Finance Stipulates Measures

Chongqing, 30th - The 100-yuan and 50-yuan banknotes issued by the four banks, Central Bank, Bank of China, Communications Bank, and Agricultural Bank, have been circulating smoothly due to their convenience for transportation. However, as more small denomination notes are needed for purchasing goods in areas close to the war zone, unscrupulous merchants are taking the opportunity to manipulate them, resulting in a premium for exchanging them. The Ministry of Finance previously reported this and repeatedly issued documents to relevant agencies to strictly investigate and prohibit it. In order to clearly indicate sanctions and pay attention to the potential for staff in charge of cashiers in various agencies and units to seek profit by abusing their positions, four measures were stipulated in February of this year as follows: In all cities and markets, banknotes issued by the four banks, Central Bank, Bank of China, Communications Bank, and Agricultural Bank, should be accepted at face value and should not be exchanged for a premium based on the size of the notes. If there are money stalls or exchange shops in various locations that exchange banknotes of different denominations, the number of establishments should be determined based on local conditions, and the exchange fee should be set at 1%, and no more should be charged. After the implementation of these measures, if there is a premium for exchanging banknotes in transactions in various businesses or exchange shops, or if exchange shops charge an exchange fee exceeding the stipulated amount, the local government in charge should suspend business for a certain number of days or order punishment based on the circumstances. If the circumstances are serious and violate other legal regulations, they should be dealt with according to those laws. If staff in charge of cashiers in various agencies and units seek profit by abusing their positions and exchanging banknotes for a premium, they should be investigated and dealt with in accordance with the provisions of Articles 2 to 6 of the Provisional Regulations on the Punishment of Corruption. The above measures have been submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval and have been telegraphed to the provincial governments for compliance, as well as to the Military Affairs Commission for forwarding to all military organs and units for compliance. The four headquarters of the four banks have also been instructed by the Ministry of Finance to select impartial auditors to conduct a thorough investigation. If such situations are discovered, the personnel of the branch offices should be dealt with in accordance with the law in order to maintain law and order.

### Location of Overseas Chinese Villages in Dushan, Guangxi, and Other Places

Chongqing, 30th - In order to facilitate overseas Chinese who have returned to China along the border of Guangxi and Guangdong, the Overseas Chinese Affairs Guidance Committee previously established an overseas Chinese village in Longzhou, Guangxi. The committee has now surveyed Dushan and other places as village sites. The natural water conservancy conditions in this area are relatively good, and efforts are still being made to dredge river channels and build reservoirs. Health personnel sent by the local authorities have established clinics to treat internal and surgical diseases for nearby residents.

Planting Begins

Agricultural experiment stations have also been established in turn. Seedlings of food crops have begun to be planted in the nurseries, and efforts are being made to collect seedlings and fertilizers. Overseas Chinese who enter the village and volunteer to cultivate the land can solve their livelihood problems.

Two Methods

It is reported that the cultivation methods are divided into two types: (cooperative cultivation) and (self-funded cultivation). Each person is allocated 30 mu of land as a general principle. (Cooperative cultivation) is originally intended to accommodate poor overseas Chinese. All food, lodging, agricultural tools, seeds, and fertilizers are provided by the village management office, and the cultivators are only responsible for labor. (Self-funded cultivation) means that all housing, agricultural tools, farming cattle, seeds, fertilizers, and all reclamation costs are borne by the self-funded cultivators.

Entry Procedures

It is reported that regarding the entry procedures and detailed regulations, in addition to contacting the Dushan Overseas Chinese Village Management Office in Longzhou, Guangxi, you can also inquire at the Overseas Chinese Reception Centers in Suixi, Dongxing, Shuidong, Shanni, and Longzhou, as well as the Overseas Chinese Guiders in Qinxian, Huiyang, Lupu, and Yongning.

The U.S. side has expressed its agreement, and acting Secretary of State Welles officially announced it on April 7th of this year.

### Two Pandas Donated to the United States Have Been Named

New York, 29th - The two pandas donated to the United States by Madame Chiang Kai-shek have been named. The male is named Pan-Dee, and the female is named Pan-Dah.

The winner of the prize for proposing these names was an 11-year-old from Colombia named Nancy Pinzon. One of the prizes is a three-day trip to New York, where the naming ceremony for the two pandas will be held at the zoo. Nancy will be invited to participate and be the "godmother" of the two pandas.

### India Problem Special

10. The Northwest Frontier of India (3)

The best starting point for traveling the frontier is perhaps Peshawar. Peshawar has always been known as the "North Gate of India." In the four decades before the British took control of the Benazir Bhutto province in the 19th century, the Sikhs strongly defended Peshawar, but made no effort to bring the tribal areas under their rule.

The journey begins in Rawalpindi. In less than two hours, one crosses the Indus River via the Attock Bridge beneath the walls of the Mughal fort in Attock. The bridge has both a railway and a highway and is an important link in India's defense transportation network. Fifteen miles to the north is Nowshera, where a railway branch line runs through Mardan to Malakand on the Swat River. This area is already part of the tribal territories. Alexander the Great led his army into India and won a great victory in a battle in the tribal area at a place called Aornos.

There are many ancient relics in the area around Peshawar and south to the Indus River (known in ancient times as the Gandhara River). However, only this part of the frontier is rich in relics, because the situation in other parts of the frontier is not peaceful enough to allow culture to develop and produce buildings like those built by the Gandhara River Buddhists.

In Peshawar, one can see various tribal peoples, as well as the Pashtuns from within the administrative region and from Afghanistan proper. This place is naturally a major military stronghold. Like most military strongholds on the frontier, it is surrounded by barbed wire. The Pashtuns need to obtain good weapons in order to effectively carry out tribal warfare. Therefore, since rifles were transported into the Benazir Bhutto province, the Pashtuns in the mountains have tried every means to steal rifles. The value of a rifle is greater than one's own life. A good rifle provided by the government is worth about two hundred rupees, but in the tribal area, the exchange value of a rifle is as high as eight hundred rupees. The Pashtuns are bold and unscrupulous thieves, but their stealing skills are not as refined as those of the Marsh Arabs of Mesopotamia.

In addition to stealing rifles and horses, the Pashtun tribes often raid villages on the plains, seizing cash, livestock, women, children, or wealthy Indian merchants, and extorting donations. Because anyone can enter India in peacetime, the Pashtuns have many conveniences. Before entering the country to carry out robberies, they first deposit their rifles at the police station at the border哨站, and then swagger into the Peshawar market, and then take a train or small car to the place they plan to rob. They stay there for a few days or weeks, observe the local situation, and formulate an action plan. Then, they return to the administrative border, retrieve their rifles, return home to gather their clan members, and prepare for the action. They set off in the dark of night, perhaps having to walk thirty miles to reach their destination, carry out a massive robbery, and set fire to one or two houses, returning to the mountains fully loaded. Afterwards, several corpses and stolen goods are often found along the way. Therefore, the work of the Northwest Frontier patrol police is very difficult.

The spring in Peshawar is particularly warm and pleasant. Tourists can travel by train or car upwards, passing through the Khyber Pass, which is about thirty miles from the Afghan border. The last twenty-odd miles of the journey pass through the Afridi area in the true tribal territories, where there is no police or law. The responsibility for guarding the highway is borne by the Afridi people. Traveling through this section of the road during the day is comfortable and carefree. Along the way, one can see villages built with walls and towers, scattered on the undulating land. Armed men are constantly vigilant, which is quite interesting. On the days when caravans set out, one can see a long line of camels on the dual carriageway, carrying goods from Central Asia, as well as fierce dogs and flocks of sheep, escorted by men, women, old and young, coming and going in an endless stream.

On the highway leading there, there are four British army outposts stationed: the Jamrud Fort at the entrance to the mountain pass, the Ali Masjid Fort about halfway through the pass, the Landi Kotal Fort on the northern slope of the pass, and the Landi Khana Fort near the Afghan border. From here, there is now a car road leading to Kabul in Afghanistan. This car road is being improved year by year, and traffic is gradually increasing.

Forty miles west of Peshawar, there is Kohat, which can be reached by a good car road. The road passes through the Adam Khel Afridi tribal area. Beside the road is the Adam Khel rifle factory, which imitates the manufacture of government rifles. The products are of excellent quality and are sold to the tribal peoples for about one hundred and fifty rupees each. Because the factory is located in the tribal area, it cannot be interfered with.

The residents of the Kurram River valley west of Kohat are Shia Muslims (who recognize Ali as Muhammad's rightful successor). The other tribes on the frontier belong to the Sunni Muslim sect. The two are distinct from each other and can be roughly compared to the Catholic Church and Protestantism in the Middle Ages. However, the Shia and Sunni Muslims are as incompatible as fire and water. Therefore, as early as 1880, the Turi people on the banks of the Kurram River signed a treaty with the Indian government, pledging their unwavering loyalty. The land in the Kurram River valley is fertile, and the people of other tribes surrounding it on three sides are all enemies, who are determined to cut the throats of the Shia people in order to please God. Therefore, the Turi people have fought hard in the past to resist, and still occasionally have to take up arms to defend themselves. They have also recruited tribesmen to form a militia, led by British officers dispatched by the Indian Army. The headquarters are located in Parachinar, near the mouth of the Kurram River. The railway extends to Sadda, about fifty miles to the north. The Peiwar Kotal Pass at the end of the Kurram River is 9,000 feet high. During the Second Anglo-Afghan War, the British army led by Lord Roberts became famous in a battle here. On the Afghan side of the mountain pass, border guards are currently stationed, and occasionally a small team of Afghan soldiers is stationed there.

West of the Kurram River is Bannu. Today's Kohat is still the same as in the past, facing the Orakzai District and the Samana Ridge, where extremely fierce battles took place during the tribal uprising in 1897. As for Bannu, it has lost its glory. This place is the gateway to the Tochi River valley and the starting point of the Mahsud and Waziristan districts. Since 1920, the policy of the people here has undergone significant changes.

Initially, the Mahsud people constantly broke into British-administered areas to carry out robberies. The British repeatedly sent troops to suppress them, which cost a lot of money but did not achieve lasting results. Until 1920, the British dispatched a large army for a final campaign. After the Mahsud and Wazir people fought hard for several months, they waited for the punitive army to re-deploy as it had done many times before, in order to harass its rearguard troops, cut off small groups of troops who were careless or exhausted, and seize the government army's good rifles, ammunition, camels, and baggage.

However, this time the Mahsud people were disappointed and surprised, because the punitive army did not re-deploy, but remained stationed there. Waziristan was originally a desolate area with no roads, and outsiders hardly knew it. Now it has developed into a well-known area, with good roads built for motor vehicle transportation. Progress has been particularly rapid in recent years, so that the Mahsud people can now use Ford cars to rush reinforcements to participate in battles, and use the smoke from gasoline evaporation to cover sneak attacks.

The continued occupation by the government army has two effects: First, the Mahsud people's residences are now within easy reach of the government army, and they can no longer safely attack villages. Second, the Mahsud people have earned substantial income by building roads or supplying goods to the army. In another three or four decades, this fierce and warlike nation may well become one of the most progressive people in India, and someday Waziristan will be to India what the Scottish Highlands are to the United Kingdom. At present, it is still in its infancy, but the power of roads to spread civilization is immeasurable.

### The Silver Union Association Resumes the Timed Clearing System Today

Members are eligible to participate regardless of currency type

The Shanghai Banking Association Clearing House changed its timed clearing system after mid-September last year. The receipt and payment of funds between banks in the clearing group were changed to collection for clearing. Clearing banks and entrusted clearing banks were renamed designated correspondent banks. Now, the Association, in accordance with the resolution of the Joint Committee of Silver and Money Industry Members, has decided to resume the timed clearing system today and has formulated eighteen articles on the method of restoring the timed clearing system, notifying the clearing banks to comply. The Association's clearing venue has been set up. From now on, clearing will be held once a day. The clearing time is 2:00 pm every day from Monday to Friday and 12:15 pm on Saturdays. Clearing of instruments is handled separately according to currency type. It is stipulated that all member banks of the Banking Association are eligible to participate in clearing. They will participate in clearing one after another by entrusting the Association to act as an agent. The method of restoring the timed clearing system is summarized below: Article 1. From the date of implementation of this method, the timed clearing system originally implemented by the Association before September 15, 1930 shall be restored immediately. All designated correspondent banks, whose account numbers are prior to No. 42, shall still be called "clearing banks." Those whose total number is No. 50 and have sub-numbers shall still be called "entrusted clearing banks." Article 4. Clearing banks and entrusted clearing banks shall print their clearing house number on the front of various instruments. Article 6. The instruments submitted for clearing by the clearing banks shall be stamped with a green ink stamp on the front. The aforementioned stamp shall only be affixed to the clearing bank's payment instruments and the Association's payment instruments, and shall have the effect of both withdrawal endorsement and parallel lines. However, if the payee on the face of the instrument is not the submitting bank itself, in addition to affixing the aforementioned stamp, the submitting bank shall still endorse separately in accordance with the law and customs. The returned instrument after clearing has been affixed with the aforementioned stamp. When the submitting bank returns it to the customer, in order to release the restriction of the parallel lines, the original stamp shall be cancelled, and the bank shall indicate the words "cancelled by a certain bank" next to the cancelled stamp, and then a staff member of the bank with endorsement rights shall sign and certify in accordance with the method stipulated in the bank's signature sample. Article 9. After the clearing staff brings the instruments submitted by other banks back to the paying bank, the bank shall quickly verify the seal and make arrangements for payment. If there are instruments that should be refused payment, the bank shall quickly send them to the Association for collection using a deposit counter sheet within the time stipulated by the Association, and then the Association shall prepare a returned instrument notice, and return the original instrument to the original submitting bank. However, among the instruments to be returned, if the original submitting bank's procedures have not been completed, but the payment can be made after the procedures are corrected, the bank shall handle directly with the original submitting bank, without sending it to the Association.

### Rich Woman Demands Divorce, Seeks 200,000 Yuan, Gu Qingtang Befriends Famous Prostitute, Deceives Wife Into Lending Over 100,000

Pan Yonglin, a 37-year-old Suzhou woman living at 37, Lane 1958, Avenue Joffre, is the daughter of a prominent Pan family in Wuxian. She received secondary education and married Gu Qingtang (the same age as Pan) in October 1931 through a matchmaker. After the marriage, the couple's relationship was harmonious, and Gu knew that his wife's family was wealthy, so he repeatedly borrowed cash, jewelry, diamonds, etc., totaling over 100,000. By the summer of last year, Gu again asked his wife for a loan unsuccessfully, and they turned against each other. Mrs. Pan asked Gu to repay the previous debt, and Gu gave her two post-dated checks from the Kwok Wah Bank, each for 50,000 yuan, dated July 31 and September 30. In late July, Gu, citing financial difficulties, asked his wife to postpone the July 31 check to September 30 for payment together. Unexpectedly, when she went to the bank to cash them on the due date, they were both returned due to insufficient funds. When she confronted Gu, she was violently assaulted. From then on, he went out for months without returning home, stopped giving household expenses, etc. Until December of last year, Mrs. Pan finally discovered that her husband was living with the famous prostitute Xu Moxian (i.e., Old Fourth of Drunken Rainbow Villa) at number [BLANK], Lane 1412, Avenue Joffre, living together like a couple, indulging in pleasure and forgetting to return. Despite repeated confrontations, he ignored her. Mrs. Pan believed that her husband was so unscrupulous that he was intentionally abandoning her, and she felt terrified of the bleak future. Therefore, she entrusted a lawyer to file a lawsuit, requesting a divorce, claiming daily living expenses until the age of sixty, and compensation for mental distress totaling 200,000 yuan, as well as seeking to recover the owed 100,000 yuan. She also stated that after the divorce, her husband was unwilling to adopt the five-year-old girl they had jointly adopted and must provide separate education expenses.

### Great Fire on Brenan Road

Fire Spreads, Burning to Death a Girl Next Door

Zhang Shunxing Paper Box Factory, located at No. 3 Caojiazhai on Brenan Road in West Shanghai, suddenly caught fire at approximately 1:40 AM yesterday morning. Flames immediately erupted, making it impossible to approach. Because paper boxes are difficult to extinguish once ignited, the fire spread to neighboring residences: No. 1 Chen Yixing Coal Store, the inhabitants of No. 4, No. 5 Xin Xin rickshaw company, and the building across the street at No. 16. The fire occurred in the middle of the night, and nearby residents were awakened from their sleep. Among them, an eleven-year-old girl in a certain household was tragically burned to death in the fire. A woman, Qiao Jiang (41 years old), was also burned on her face, arms, and abdomen.

At 4:40 AM yesterday morning, a fire suddenly broke out in the Yongsheng Thermos Factory at No. 41, Lane 57, Zhujiazhai on Great West Road. The fire brigade dispatched vehicles to extinguish it, resulting in the destruction of several warehouses and two writing rooms.

At 9:00 AM yesterday morning, smoke suddenly appeared and a fire started in the waste room of Minli Middle School at No. 414 Weihaiwei Road. It took an hour to extinguish, and one room was destroyed.

At 1:10 PM yesterday afternoon, a fire broke out accidentally at No. 107, Lane 727, Tianzhuang Road, causing thick smoke. As a result, the house at that number was completely destroyed, and the fire also affected the neighboring houses at No. 109 and No. 111, two buildings in total. The fire brigade arrived and extinguished the fire after about two hours.

### Japanese Military's Shanghai Suburban Border Line: Regulations for Crossing

According to a report from the Domei News Agency in Shanghai, the supreme commanders of the army and navy in the Shanghai area issued a proclamation on May 1, stipulating that from May 10, anyone passing through the Japanese military's border line in the four suburbs of Shanghai must hold a county resident certificate, a city resident certificate, or an equivalent form of identification. Before obtaining city resident certificates, citizens of the two concessions may obtain a temporary pass issued by the Shanghai Special Affairs Agency, the Shanghai Municipal Council, or the French Municipal Council to pass through the border line. The original text of the proclamation and the remarks of the army and navy press secretary are as follows:

Original Proclamation

Regarding this proclamation, in order to maintain the public order of Shanghai City, after May 10, those wishing to enter Shanghai through the Japanese military border line around Shanghai City must hold a county (city) resident certificate or an equivalent certificate issued by the relevant government agency. When passing through the border line, they should present their county (city) resident certificate or an equivalent certificate issued by the relevant government agency to the Japanese military police or sentries. Those who violate the above regulations or use forged certificates to enter Shanghai will be severely punished according to military law without leniency. This proclamation is hereby issued.

Summary of Remarks

In order to facilitate the passage of Chinese people within the security zone and maintain public order, the Japanese military stipulates that from May 10, anyone wishing to enter Shanghai through the Japanese military security line in the four suburbs of Shanghai must hold a county (city) resident certificate or an equivalent certificate. In the past, none of the residents of the Shanghai International Settlement and the French Concession held city resident certificates, which caused various inconveniences when they wished to travel within the security zone. The two concessions have now decided to issue city resident certificates widely in the near future. However, the issuance of city resident certificates will take a considerable amount of time. Therefore, during this period, in order to facilitate the passage of those who have not yet obtained city resident certificates, the Shanghai Special Affairs Agency will issue temporary passes. The Special Affairs Agency, the Shanghai Municipal Council, and the French Municipal Council will issue these passes. However, the issuance of temporary passes is limited to the end of June and will be invalid from July 1. In addition, those who forge county (city) resident certificates or impersonate others will be severely punished by military law and should pay special attention to this requirement.

### Shanghai Municipal Council Budget for This Year: Cancellation of the Separate Allocation of Education Funds

The Shanghai Municipal Council's Information Office announced that the draft budget for the Council for the year 1942, as well as the various recommendations made by the New Revenue Sources Committee, have been reviewed by the Finance Committee at meetings held on March 23, April 10, and April 23 of this year. The final budget was then compiled by the Director of the Finance Department and submitted to the Board of Directors for consideration at a meeting held yesterday (April 30), together with an explanatory memorandum, and was subsequently passed. Given the current situation, it is essential to balance income and expenditure. The Finance Committee and the New Revenue Sources Committee spent a considerable amount of time studying how to balance income and expenditure and concluded that it was necessary to recommend to the Council the implementation of certain new taxes and increases in existing taxes. According to the Director of the Finance Department, the method used by the Council to prepare the income and expenditure budget for this year is different from that used in previous years. Since 1931, the Council has separately allocated the budget for education funds. This year, it was considered appropriate to cancel this method and prepare a comprehensive budget proposal. The final budget proposal is as follows:

1.  Regular Income and Expenditure

Regular Income for This Year

Approximately 104,525,850 yuan

Regular Expenditure for This Year

Approximately 104,507,090 yuan

2.  Temporary Income and Expenditure

Temporary Income for This Year

Approximately 14,217,870 yuan

Temporary Expenditure for This Year

Approximately 14,201,880 yuan

Surplus in Temporary Income and Expenditure - Approximately 15,990 yuan

(A) Regular Income

The regular income for this year has generally been conservatively estimated, in the hope that the local situation will not deteriorate further and hinder the tax revenue that is currently being collected. The total income from various sources is estimated at approximately 104,525,850 yuan in national currency, an increase of 24,416,110 yuan compared to the previous year, or an increase of 30.48 percent. The proposed increase in business tax has not been included because it has been decided to postpone its collection and reconsider it at the end of the year.

Land Tax 18,170,140 yuan. The land tax rate for the first half of this year is calculated according to the method used in the previous year, at 1.35 percent of the estimated land value, plus a surcharge of 40 percent. Council properties and tax-exempt properties are not included. From July 1, the tax rate will be uniformly increased to 2.5 percent. However, the total tax revenue has been conservatively estimated at 20 percent to allow for unforeseen circumstances. It is hoped that land that has been developed but not registered will be taxed in accordance with regulations this year. (To be continued)

It is expected that its publication will cause a sensation.

The design is novel and beautiful, and the mechanical components are based on modern automobile principles, using high-quality materials for durability. The carriage is spacious and can accommodate two people sitting together. The seats are completely modeled after sofas, making them soft and comfortable for long periods of sitting. Front and rear bumpers are installed for safe driving. It is reported that the company has obtained a license to operate in the International Settlement and began operations recently (on the 26th). The main station is located at the original site of the Pike Road Yunfei Motor Car Company. The rental rates are as follows: 6 yuan per hour for up to 6 hours per day, with a 10% discount for exceeding 6 hours. Payment is made to the driver upon completion of the rental.

### Preface to Zhouyi's Ancient Historical Perspective (2)

— Hu Puan

After teaching for a year, there was no impact. I often said to myself, what exactly is the study of the Book of Changes? If it is regarded as the origin of natural science and mechanical science, it is too far-fetched. If it is regarded as a book of philosophy, it is only a part of the "Commentary on the Appended Phrases." If it is regarded as a book of divination, although it has some significance in ancient times, it has no value in modern times. Moreover, the images said in the "Great Images," such as the "Tun" hexagram, which says that the superior man manages, and the "Xu" hexagram, which says that the superior man eats and drinks and makes merry, have no meaning of divination at all. All other sixty-two hexagrams are the same. The "Sequence of Hexagrams" is considered a forgery by the ancients, and it also has no meaning of divination at all. Then, what is the thought of those who forged it about the Book of Changes? The "Commentary on the Appended Phrases," both upper and lower, also have a large part that has no meaning of divination at all. Explaining the Book of Changes with divination, such as Zhu Xi's "Original Meaning of the Book of Changes" in the Song Dynasty, and even Takashima's "Divination of the Book of Changes" in Japan, does not feel right to me in the end. The longer it is accumulated, the deeper it is thought, the more I cannot grasp its essence. Whenever I meet someone who is good at the Book of Changes, I do not hesitate to humbly ask for advice. Each person speaks according to what they have learned, some speak of images, some speak of numbers, some speak of principles, some speak of events, some speak of pre-heaven and post-heaven. Every aspect makes sense, but there are too many paths, which makes me more and more enter a five-mile fog and cannot get out. Therefore, I made up my mind to read through several types of Song Confucianist "Book of Changes" in "Tongzhi Hall Classics Explained." Sometimes I felt that their theory was extremely good, and sometimes I felt that it was far-fetched and not close to reality, like looking at the sky in a window grid, and it was impossible to make a complete picture. Therefore, I boldly wrote a "Great Images Explanation" and a "Sequence of Hexagrams Explanation," and hid them in a box without showing them to anyone. No matter whether it is a Han or Song scholar, no one has ever explained the Book of Changes in this way.

In April 1939, I suddenly suffered a stroke. Fortunately, I did not die, but I became paralyzed on one side of my body and became a disabled person. So I used the Book of Changes to pass the time. I remembered Hang Xinzai saying that Jiao Xun followed Han learning and could connect the images of the lines of the sixty-four hexagrams, with no word or phrase that was not interconnected. Ji Dakui followed Song learning and could expound on the nature of the principles and transform and combine them with the images of the lines of the sixty-four hexagrams, which was unprecedented by scholars of the Book of Changes in all dynasties. Duanmu Guohu later combined Han and Song learning into one, verifying each one with classics and commentaries, with no word or phrase being superfluous. So I took Jiao Litang's "Extensive Explanation of the Book of Changes," "Brief Explanation of the Diagrams of the Book of Changes," and "Commentary on the Chapters of the Book of Changes," Ji Shenzhai's "Questions on the Book of Changes," "External Compilation on Viewing the Book of Changes," and Duanmu Heqing's "Guidance on the Zhouyi" and read them carefully. It took a year to finish. Jiao's examples of "Parallel Communication," "Mutual Mistake," and "Timely Action" are good. What is particularly good is that in the sixty-four hexagrams and three hundred and eighty-four lines, the ominous can be transformed into auspicious, and the dangerous can be transformed into no blame, only the "Completed" hexagram, the original hexagram cannot be ascended or descended, and other hexagrams cannot be communicated in parallel. For humans are animals of heaven and earth. If internal thoughts do not move and external hands and feet do not move, then they become disabled. The sage saw the great movement below and observed its convergence. Only through movement can there be convergence. Those who are still and do not move are not not moving, but not moving乱ly. Two and five act first, and one, four, three, and six follow them, which is not乱 movement, which Jiao calls being in position. One, four, three, and six act before two and five, which is乱 movement, which Jiao calls losing the way. Only by not moving乱ly can one be moved and then communicate the reason of the world. Today, people's hands and feet do not move, the external is not moving, their thoughts are not used, the internal is not moving, and they become completely finished. Jiao's essence is like this, and it seems that no one has made it clear yet. Ji Shenzhai's Book of Changes is nothing more than explaining the Hetu, Luoshu, pre-heaven, and post-heaven. Duanmu Heqing's Book of Changes has extremely detailed examples of mixed hexagrams, wrong hexagrams, hexagrams of transformation, hexagrams of reversal, destiny hexagrams, tied hexagrams, and sound and rhyme hexagrams, but their meaning is more obscure. I think the Book of Changes is not usually said in this way.

### Government Bonds Rebound

The government bond market was temporarily halted yesterday due to selling pressure. However, some investors entered the market to observe the trend, unsure whether to wait for the market to recover before taking action. The initial market was weak, with Category C bonds falling to a low of 57.60 yuan, largely due to profit-taking by long positions. Later, due to uncertainty about the future, short sellers rushed to cover their positions, causing prices to rise. Category E bonds, which had fallen sharply, rose rapidly due to the perception that prices were cheap, attracting attention and surging to a high of 7.40 yuan before closing slightly lower at 7.60 yuan. There was no trading in Category D bonds. Categories A, B, and C bonds also rebounded slightly by a few jiao to about 1 yuan. Category C bonds even reached the 60 yuan mark. The trend is that new funds are flowing into the market in large quantities, causing a temporary rebound, but this is not necessarily a cause for celebration. Yesterday's buyers included Lianyi, Zhongfu, Yiji, Tongyuan, Dechang, Yichang, Renfeng, Gongmao, Wuhe, Chengkang, Xinhua, and other firms, as well as some individual investors covering their positions. The sellers were Shuntai, acting on behalf of a certain financial institution with a large order, as well as Tongshun, Tongli, and Tongkang. Other sellers included Yuxing, Baolong, Hu Heji, Fuhua, and Jiufeng. It is worth noting that large long positions have been accumulating in the market for several days. Any relaxation could be cause for concern. In the end, except for Category D bonds, which did not trade, all other categories rebounded by 5-8 jiao to 3.40 yuan. The trading volume was approximately 1,200,000 to 1,300,000 yuan. A summary table is listed below.

Starting today, the market opening time will be advanced by one hour from the bank's business hours, which is half an hour earlier, to 9:30 AM.

### Gold Shop Still Sells: Cooked Red Gold Initially Rises Then Falls

Yesterday, the informal market for cash-cooked red gold initially showed an upward trend followed by a decline. This was because gold shops continued to sell, and the Japanese military scrip also fell. The sentiment of those hoping for an upward trend was shaken again. From the morning, securities firms intentionally tried to drive up the price, buying at 22,500 yuan per bar (ten taels), a high of 650 yuan. However, seeing cash shops and silver shops selling, they shouted a small premium of 500 yuan, and transactions continued at 22,000 yuan. The military scrip reported a small decline, with the Tianjin group offering more than demanding, and sellers continuing to increase, causing the price to fall another small amount of 100 yuan, dropping to 21,700 yuan. At times, securities firms, on behalf of outside clients, dragged in and raised the price to 21,900 yuan. After 11 o'clock, the market weakened again, with the final transaction price at 21,700 yuan, a small decrease of 150 yuan from the previous day. The difference between the highest and lowest prices of the day was 800 yuan, and trading was quite active.

The selling price for silver shop jewelry gold was lowered by 50 yuan by both Da Xin and other firms at noon, to 2,250 yuan (purchases were reduced by 300 yuan). The listed price for silver ingots was 18 yuan, but the black market price had fallen to 16 yuan. Silver coins were still being bought at 9 yuan and 60 cents.

### Currency Prices Generally Decline

Yesterday, in the foreign exchange market, the British gold pound and the American gold dollar each fell by 10 yuan. The former declined to 470 yuan, and the latter to 480 yuan. American dollar scrip was bought at 35 yuan and 80 cents and sold at 36 yuan and 30 cents. Hong Kong scrip remained at 5 yuan and some odd cents, large denomination notes decreased by a small amount of 10 cents. Military scrip suddenly trended downward, opening in the morning at 7 yuan, 62 cents, and quickly falling to 7 yuan and 33 cents. In the afternoon, it briefly rose to 7 yuan and 43 cents, but ultimately settled at 7 yuan and 35 cents, a decrease of approximately 15 cents from the previous day.

Yesterday, the Shanghai Money Trade Association's interbank lending rate remained at 12 cents. The discounted bill rate had been reduced by 5 yuan, with the discount rate per 1,000 yuan falling from 32 yuan to 20 yuan, and finally settling at 25 yuan. The price difference between the new and old legal tender was 33.5 cents per yuan.

### Eastern Cloth Plummets Due to Halt in Movement and Intensified Control

Eastern cloth opened firm in the morning but was weakest in the afternoon. This was because, after the cessation of zero-piece movement certificates, it was rumored that factory orders would also have to be registered and reported, leading to heightened concern. As a result, the new first-grade fine cloth order opened at 287 yuan but closed at 283 yuan. The price once plummeted to 277.5 yuan in the afternoon, but the shorts covered at the close, pushing the price up to 283 yuan, a decrease of 6.5 yuan from the previous evening's close. The bank order for the first-grade cloth was extremely weak, selling for only 239 yuan, a difference of 44 yuan per piece. The highest asking price for Four Gentlemen drill red orders was 9 yuan and 62 cents, but the lowest price fell to 9 yuan and 19 cents. The evening close was 9 yuan and 35 cents. Yellow factory orders were priced at 9 yuan and 5 cents, but there were few buyers.

### Corn Sales are Strong and Unique

Corn sales are quite good, and the market continues to be strong. Yesterday, local retailers sent 400 bags of unhusked Wuhu corn at a price of 176 to 178 yuan delivered, and another batch was sold from here at 173-174 yuan. 150 bags of Saigon corn were priced at 185 yuan, both representing an increase of 3-5 yuan from the previous day.

Spring and Autumn

### Trend

— Jin Yi

A rumor: Twenty-ninth year banknotes will not be valid. Checking the banknotes in my pocket, they were all from the twenty-ninth year. At the end of the month, salaries were paid, but none of the notes were issued before the twenty-ninth year. So, you used mine, and I used yours, and only twenty-ninth year banknotes were circulating on the market.

Now there's another trend: Small denomination notes are scarce! Food shops put up a "Notice": 5 yuan notes will only be accepted for purchases above 3 yuan, 10 yuan notes for purchases above 8 yuan. It's best to buy 5 yuan worth of peanuts or 10 yuan worth of rice dumplings and candy, and the transaction is settled cleanly. In the past, when getting on the trolleybus, the ticket seller often asked if you wanted to exchange for small denomination notes. Now, taking out a 5 yuan note on the trolleybus means you're either being "wronged" or you're an "easy target"!

Before the "rumor" arrived, twenty-ninth year banknotes didn't require any discount. After the "rumor" passed, twenty-ninth year banknotes were still fine.

Before the "trend," small denomination notes were the primary bargaining chip for expenses. After the "trend," you might find it annoying to have ten or five yuan in small denomination notes in your pocket.

But how do these "rumors and trends" arise? No one knows, but everyone suffers, except for cigarette shops and small money lenders.

### Welcoming Summer

— Jiang Du

The weather these past few days isn't quite warm, but it's definitely not cold. Saying that May marks the beginning of summer might be a bit too early. However, people's hearts are always looking ahead, like business friends looking at futures, everyone expects higher prices, so-called "people's hearts are unusually shrewd," it seems a rather apt description. According to the seasonal calendar, we're just a week away from the Beginning of Summer. Once the Beginning of Summer arrives, the Dragon Boat Festival is just around the corner. Once the Dragon Boat Festival passes, we're flowing downstream... "Cicadas drag their lingering sounds past parting branches"... in the blink of an eye, isn't summer about to pass again?

Life is truly good! Don't ask about rice prices, don't worry about food storage, never mind spring or summer. Welcoming summer early, there's nothing wrong with that, right?

Buying mosquito coils, hoarding Ten Drops of Water, on the streets, Coca-Cola, Watson's, and Zheng Guang He, delivery trucks are frequently seen. Even though you're still wearing a flannel robe, or even a camel hair robe, a spring wool, or even a dark blue or black serge "three-piece" suit, this "spring"—call her sister, younger sister, or any fairy or goddess you like—is always hard to hold on to!

Since spring can't be held back, let's just welcome summer. It's both practical and forward-looking, so why not? "Talking about the convenience of summer," how about doing a primary school student's composition?

Opening: "Humans live in the world, and cannot do without summer. Summer has three conveniences." Then, let's explain these three major conveniences. The so-called three major conveniences, of course, cannot be separated from the three major things in life: clothing, food, and shelter.

No, clothing, food, shelter, and transportation are missing the word "transportation."

Say: According to the current situation, can we still "travel" in the summer? Rickshaws charge at least two yuan, trolleybuses take ten or twenty minutes to wait, and a pair of rubber-soled leather shoes costs fifty or sixty yuan. No "traveling," no "traveling"! Let's omit the word "travel" for now.

Regarding summer clothing. First, the materials are thin, the "cost" is low, and the sewing is also less. The "embarrassing person" wearing a long gown, if necessary, can simply wear a set of short shirt and pants - even a vest and shorts seem indecent, I wonder if the public can accommodate it given the current living standards? - If you meet an acquaintance, they won't think you can't even afford a long gown.

"Eating in summer" - don't mistake it for "eating in Guangzhou," such as two stars accompanying the moon, dragon and tiger fighting, etc. - uneconomical but can be economical. Physiologically speaking, there are fewer people in summer, and the need for food is reduced. Entering summer prohibits random eating, which is the great way to health. In terms of psychology, you also don't dare to eat too much. Just eating boiled water with rice and pickled radish seems very generous.

### Sharing the Same Boat Through Storms

— He Jia Zhi

(4) In the fading light

Because Guo Fang first brought up the issue of marriage, Cui Zhen also took the opportunity to retort, "Miss Chen, are you engaged?" Given Cui Zhen's education, she could only ask this question. Guo Fang said, "Guess?" Cui Zhen smiled and said, "I guess you are engaged. Although I don't know what clothes Shanghai misses wear now or what they say, I think you are the most beautiful one. The people of Shanghai won't leave you alone. Matchmakers must have worn down the threshold of your home in Shanghai. That's why I guess you are engaged, am I right?" Cui Zhen has always grown up in a pessimistic environment. For her to be able to chatter with someone she just met today and boldly ask questions is a great event unprecedented in her life. And Guo Fang's response to her at the time was, "If Sister Cui Zhen says I am, then I am."

After a tour of the fields, Cui Zhen was very happy. She took Guo Fang to Shuangmei Study and said, "Brother Cheng, Miss Chen and I are back, have you looked for Miss Chen?" Wei Cheng was spreading out obituary reference materials and looking at them, smiling and saying, "I heard the magpies say that you went to look at the banks of the fields, but unfortunately there wasn't much to see. You went, and I still haven't written a single word, I regret not going with you." Guo Fang said, "You can't go, the villagers are easily surprised, and you can't be as casual as you are in Shanghai." Wei Cheng said, "That doesn't matter. I've always wanted to change the bad psychology of the villagers. All they can do is make rumors, and what we will put in front of them is the truth, and facts speak louder than words." (64)

### Record of Observations

— Wei Jing

"Paste is available outside the door." "Five cents per envelope."

These twelve words were found on a paste jar at the ×× Road post office.

In 1941, fortune-telling stalls, in addition to writing letters for people, had an extra source of income.

### Life and Work

— Yuan Ying

Never be satisfied with the status quo. One should strictly examine one's actions to know how to do better.

The life of enjoyment or a life of hardship.

Whether work will be joyful or painful in the future depends mostly on the attitude you have towards work, not the work itself.

If you cannot find a path in the work you do, it is better to change to another job.

If you manage your work with enthusiasm and treat it as an interesting game, opportunities can be found anytime, anywhere.

People hate their work not because the work itself is hateful, but because they have not learned a few simple secrets to change their attitude towards work.

Life is a battle. You should view life, your daily life, as an opportunity to overcome the difficulties and obstacles in battle. Your chance of winning every day is better than the previous day.

Living, so serious - Living. In fact, once it comes to summer, as long as there is a mat, all sleeping problems are solved. There is no need to buy a Jinshan blanket, and even a "slippery" silk cotton quilt - you often hear people shouting to sell them in the alleys - is unnecessary. Simply take the universe as a small room, no matter how bad your "appearance" is, the great heavens and earth will always accommodate you, so there is no need to worry

One person's clothing, food, and housing are like this, extended to a family, a community... from the perspective of economic consumption, isn't that a great benefit?

Lovely summer, you can't help but want to "welcome" it.

Great summer, it is best to ask him to come sooner. Think forward, have a clear understanding, what do you all think?

### Malaria

— Yong Sheng

Unintentionally, all the characteristics of malaria were experienced in my body, sudden chills and fever, ending in whole body sweating.

It happened every other day, once, twice, three times, but my weak body could no longer withstand the trembling and high fever, my face was pale, and I was dizzy...

Therefore, my Jiangbei nanny contributed the method of catching the "malaria ghost." When it broke out, take the toilet lid on top of your head and shout loudly. It is said that this can scare away the malaria ghost, and the disease will suddenly get better. But I don't want to do this, even if there really is a "malaria ghost," I don't think that dirty thing will have the power to ward off evil, because "ghosts" like "dirt."

The old people also offered their contributions. They told me not to pay attention to it. Over time, the "worms" of malaria would destroy each other, and the disease would suddenly get better. This method seems to be better than the previous one, but I am too thin and cannot withstand "long time." Maybe the "worms" haven't died yet, and I'll die first.

Finally, I finally took "medicine" - the price was of course very expensive - and drove away the malaria. - Whether it's a malaria ghost or malaria worms, my body has returned to health.

Now, the mosquitoes have already been born, and I repeatedly ask everyone to remember the "proper way" to treat malaria!

### Soliciting Inscriptions for Bai Jiao's Calligraphy Exhibition

— Yanxi Bai Hua

Rising up like a dragon and snake by the wine cup,

Not being among the sages is also greatly arrogant,

Wang Chuan's poetic realm, the brush of the Orchid Pavilion,

Today in the South, we see Bai Jiao.
