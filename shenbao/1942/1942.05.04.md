### Textile Raw Material Panic in France, Clothing Problem Serious, Pedestrians on Streets Shabby, Women Lack Silk Stockings and Go Barefoot

Vichy, 2nd (Havas) - For the past two years, imports of textile raw materials into France have been cut off, and domestic stocks are gradually being depleted, so the clothing problem is extremely serious. This can be seen from the shabby clothes of passersby on the streets. The French were originally very particular about the style and tailoring of their clothing, but today they can only renovate or remodel old clothes. It is common to see men between the ages of 20 and 50 wearing mismatched clothing, with a mix of casual wear and military uniforms. As for French women, they have always been skilled in dressing up, and although they lack clothing, they still dress as well as before, but because of the lack of silk stockings, they have to go barefoot. The purchase of textiles has been restricted for the past two years, and will soon be subject to rationing. In the past, each person could only buy six pairs of wool socks and two woolen underwear, so in fact they can only wear old clothes. The allocation of clothes is limited to returning prisoners of war and refugees, as well as newborn babies and newly married couples.

### Special Issue on the Indian Question

11. Indian Wisdom and Wit

"Your Majesty, my umbrella is also an illusion," the preacher replied huffily. "Everything in the world is an illusion."

King Babur's name is known throughout India, and he was famous for his wit. One day, Emperor Akbar asked his ministers if there was anything he could not do. King Babur immediately told the emperor, "Your Majesty cannot satisfy the needs of an infant."

So it was decided that tomorrow Babur would act as a child to prove his bold rebuttal.

Tomorrow, the Emperor specially ordered that everything a baby needs be prepared--milk candy, toys, and so on. Babur sat in the cradle and asked the emperor to drink freshly squeezed milk.

"A very simple matter," the emperor replied with a deep sigh. Immediately, a servant handed Babur a cup of freshly squeezed milk.

"What else do you want?" the emperor asked.

"Put this cup of milk back into the cow's udder," Babur said.

A modern Indian story is about a rich man and a cannibal.

Chang Weng asked the cannibalistic chief why he was not ashamed of his cannibalistic behavior.

"What harm is there?" the chief replied. "You eat the food of the poor, and I eat the poor. When I eat him, his suffering ends; when you eat his food, his suffering begins!"

Indian villagers are extremely frugal. Sometimes they buy a pair of shoes and would rather carry them in their hands and go home barefoot. One villager spent the money he had worked hard for all year to buy an umbrella. After buying the umbrella, he walked home. On the way, he suddenly encountered a torrential downpour. The farmer took off his clothes and wrapped the umbrella to prevent it from getting wet in the heavy rain. A farmer from the same village was also on his way home and asked him to open the umbrella so that everyone could shelter from the rain.

"My new umbrella will be damaged," the farmer replied, "Lend me your clothes too, so that this umbrella will not get wet."

Brahmans are noble, and if an Indian of a lower class gets within a hundred yards of them, he should be severely reprimanded.

One day, a Brahman was seized by a tiger in the forest, and there was a lower-class man nearby. The Brahman asked the lower-class man for help.

"I am the lowliest person in India. I cannot get within a hundred yards of you," the lower-class man said.

A scholar was writing a letter in front of another person, and that person read out the sentences in the letter word by word. Later, the scholar wrote in the letter:

"If there are no thieves reading my letter here, I can tell you all my secrets." The person immediately stood up and said, "God! I have neither peeped nor read your letter. "Fool!" The scholar scolded, "Then how did you say what you just said?"

A blind man was carrying a lantern in his hand and a bottle on his shoulder, walking at night. He met a friend, who asked:

"Oh, you idiot! It's nighttime, and you're blind. What are you doing with a lantern?"

"It's useless to me, but it's very useful to idiots like you. That way you won't bump into me and break my bottle," the blind man replied.

The following story is circulating in the Northwest Frontier Province.

Once upon a time, there was a very clever scholar. There also lived in the same village a woman and her young child. One day, the woman shouted under the porch for her child to bring an empty basket to send some rice to the neighbors. The porch was supported by wooden pillars. The child stood outside the porch, hugged the wooden pillar with both hands, and held the bamboo basket to let the mother pour the rice in.

"Okay, take the rice and send it to the neighbors," the mother said.

"Oh! Oh! Oh!" the child said. "I can't go, my two arms are around the wooden pillar, and my hands are holding the bamboo basket, I can't separate!"

"Oh my god, what do we do?" The mother muttered in distress. So after thinking for a while, she ran to the very clever scholar. The scholar and the mother, and a large group of villagers, came to the house. As soon as the very clever scholar saw the child's plight, he immediately said:

"Amitabha! This is a very easy problem to solve. Quickly! Everyone, neighbors, come and help remove the roof. Then you lift the child up so that he can safely escape the shackles of the wooden pillar without losing a grain of rice. "Remove the roof and lift the child up so that he can safely escape the shackles of the wooden pillar without losing a grain of rice." "Wonderful, wonderful!" the villagers agreed. "Really, this is the most clever scholar in the world!"

### Indian Congress President Azad Declares Readiness to Resolve Muslim Issue, Forms Joint Committee to Discuss Compromise, Congress Executive Committee Passes Resolution Yesterday

Allahabad, 2nd (Havas) - Indian Congress President Azad has declared that the party is prepared to make every effort to resolve the Muslim issue. It is now planned to appoint five representatives to form a joint committee with five Muslim representatives to discuss a compromise between the two parties.

Saigon, 3rd (Haitong) - According to news from Allahabad, the All-India Congress Executive Committee yesterday resolved the Indian Independence Plan with a majority of 290 votes. Only 17 votes were against it. The Muslim League proposed a motion to recognize the right of Muslims to build an autonomous state, but the All-India Congress rejected it with 120 votes against 19.

Berlin, 2nd (Havas) - The resolution passed by the Executive Committee of the Indian National Congress has been commented on by German officials. The position of India has now been explained to the outside world. In short, even if Britain loosens its control over India, it is not tolerable to the Indians, and negotiations with the British government can only be carried out after its freedom has been guaranteed. Furthermore, the recent victories of the Japanese army in Burma are worthy of consideration by British leaders.

Lisbon, 2nd (Domei) - According to a Reuters dispatch from Allahabad, the All-India National Congress Executive Committee held a conference here last night to discuss the issue of supporting Indian independence. With 180 votes against 4, it passed a wartime resolution to deal with any aggression with non-violent non-cooperation. The content of the case is that all members of the All-India Congress should eliminate the concept of foreign interference or aggression against India, and should resolutely resist when India is invaded. However, if Britain refuses to allow the Indian people to organize a national defense force, they should adopt a policy of non-violent non-cooperation. Indians should not obey the orders of the aggressors. If the aggressors occupy our houses and fields, we should refuse them, even at the cost of our lives. If we look at Britain's attitude, we know that it does not need more than non-interference from us. The British government's proposals and Cripps' statements have increased our pain and increased our distrust of the British government and our spirit of non-cooperation with Britain. The British government's refusal to recognize India's independence during this extraordinary period has exposed its status as an imperialist government and has brought foreign troops to India to defend India. India's strong human resources have not been used. Past experience tells us that the arrival of foreign troops in India is enough to hinder India's rights and encroach on India's freedom. India is strongly opposed to the foreign authorities' actions to freely dispose of Indian property.

### British Planes Attack Norwegian Waters, Bomb Northern France Airfields

London, 2nd (Havas) - The Air Ministry recently released a communique stating that British coastal patrol squadrons flew to Norwegian waters yesterday and attacked German ships.

### Denmark - Prime Minister Dies, Finance Minister Buhl Succeeds Him

Copenhagen, 3rd (Haitong News Agency) - Danish Prime Minister Stauning, who had been ill for some time, passed away this morning at the age of sixty-nine. Stauning devoted himself to the Danish Social Democratic Labor movement in his early years. From 1898 to 1919, he served as the accounting director of the Danish Social Democratic Party. Stauning first formed a cabinet in 1924 and a second in 1929, with no significant changes since. Stauning's foreign policy was to maintain close ties with neighboring countries. After Germany began its operations against Norway on April 9, 1940, Stauning and the Danish King jointly requested that the Danish people remain calm and not resist the German troops entering Norwegian territory. Stauning had been seriously ill for several days and had been in a coma since the night before, without regaining consciousness.

Copenhagen, 3rd (Haitong News Agency) - Danish Finance Minister Buhl has been ordered to officially assume the position of Prime Minister. Buhl had temporarily served as Prime Minister when the incumbent Prime Minister Stauning was too ill to perform his duties.

### Australia May Implement Food Rationing

### German and Italian Leaders Meet - Appear to Adopt Necessary Measures - French Political Circles Analyze Future Situation

Berlin, 2nd (Havas) - Regarding the meeting between the German and Italian leaders in Salzburg, the "Volkischer Beobachter" commented that after this meeting, the two leaders have emphatically declared their determination to continue fighting until they achieve final victory. Furthermore, the people of Germany and Italy know that the Axis powers initially did not desire war, but because the current war was imposed on them by other countries, it has become a life-or-death struggle. We have already achieved significant victories, and we must continue to strive to achieve final victory, it said. The Berliner Börsen-Zeitung also reported that the meeting between the German and Italian leaders must have led to significant decisions. We are fortunate to have such great leaders, while the enemy entrusts their affairs to low-level politicians, which is truly laughable.

Important Speeches by Political Leaders of Various Countries

Vichy - Havas - Political figures here recently commented that in the last week of April, political leaders from various countries successively delivered important speeches. For example, German Führer Hitler delivered a speech to the Reichstag on the 27th, forcefully stating that Germany is preparing for the current war to enter a new phase and must therefore obtain full powers from the Reichstag to maintain discipline during this war. Japanese Prime Minister Tojo also delivered a speech on the same day, analyzing the reasons for the Japanese military's victories in the early stages of the Pacific War. The following day, President Roosevelt delivered a radio address, explaining the need for the American people to make significant sacrifices and clarifying the United States' attitude towards France. On May 1st, Stalin, on the occasion of Labor Day, also announced to the nation in Moscow that 1942 would be the decisive year for the future of the Soviet Union.

The Meeting Between German and Italian Leaders Attracts World Attention

The most noteworthy event is the meeting between the German and Italian leaders in Salzburg. The decisions made have not yet been announced, but it is known that they must be very important, as the German and Italian leaders always meet during critical times. The two leaders have reviewed the military situation, which can be stated with certainty. However, the talks lasted for two days and must have discussed political, legal, and economic issues. From a military standpoint, the German and Italian leaders have clearly agreed to take the necessary measures to coordinate the war efforts of both countries and hope to combine the battles in Eastern Europe, the Mediterranean, and East Asia into a large-scale battlefield. Based on this, Italian troops will operate on the Eastern Front, while German troops will operate in the Mediterranean and North Africa. As for political matters, nothing is known at present. However, according to political observers, they discussed the issue of Turkey. In the past few weeks, the Axis powers have been making great efforts to approach Turkey. German Ambassador to Turkey, von Papen, remains very active in Ankara. Bulgarian Prime Minister Filov recently gave a speech to Parliament, expressing Bulgaria's desire to improve relations with Turkey. In addition, Italy has also been engaged in economic talks with Turkey. The Axis powers clearly want to respect Turkey's neutrality but still attempt to influence Turkey to adopt an attitude favorable to the Axis powers. It is difficult to say at this time what military plans are hidden behind this diplomatic activity. What is known is that the Axis powers are certainly attempting to link the Eastern Front and the North African battlefield, and the Suez Canal will also be one of the future offensive targets. It is expected that once this offensive begins, it will be difficult for Turkey to maintain its neutrality. According to unconfirmed reports, the issue of France and the relationship between France and Germany and Italy were also discussed by both sides. In France itself, the major event of this week is the return of US Ambassador to France, Admiral Leahy, to the United States for consultations. Before leaving, the ambassador paid a visit to Marshal Pétain and Chief of Government Laval. However, the tense relations between the United States and France seem to have eased somewhat recently. The Vichy government and semi-official sources have not commented on the part of President Roosevelt's speech that involved France. However, President Roosevelt's statement that the United States is concerned about the French Empire, as well as the United States sending troops to the French Pacific island of New Caledonia, and the anti-French propaganda in American newspapers, have clearly caused great repercussions in Vichy.

### Turkey Strives to Maintain Neutrality

According to yesterday's dispatches, in the past few weeks, the Axis powers have made great efforts to approach Turkey. German Ambassador to Turkey, von Papen, remains very active in Ankara. Bulgarian Prime Minister Filov recently gave a speech to Parliament, expressing Bulgaria's desire to improve relations with Turkey. In addition, Italy has also been engaged in economic talks with Turkey. The Axis powers clearly want to respect Turkey's neutrality but are still attempting to influence Turkey. It is evident that Turkey is currently in an extremely difficult situation. Although Turkey has repeatedly stated its utmost efforts to maintain neutrality, it remains uncertain whether it will be drawn into the vortex of war in the future. "Top Picture" Turkey's gliding schools, there are as many as nine, here is the Lnonu school, with five hundred and fifty boys and five hundred and fifty girls in training. "Bottom Picture" Located in Cuduk, about eight miles from Ankara, Turkish engineers have spent three and a half years building a water gate and reservoir, one of Turkey's great engineering feats.

### Australian Sand Comber Donates Diamond to Enlist

Sydney, 3rd (Reuters) - A ragged sand comber in Perth, Western Australia, handed over a diamond worth 300,000 pounds when enlisting. It is said to have been found in the sand north of Broome on the west coast of Australia. The authorities have now learned the details of the matter. A plane that was the last to leave Java was entrusted to carry a bag of diamonds to an Australian bank. The plane was shot down by the Japanese 60 miles north of Broome and forced to land. The pilot searched frantically for the bag of diamonds but could not find it. The authorities then sent personnel to search the area, but they also failed to find it.

The New York Times also said that there is now reason to believe that General Pétain has met with Giraud several times and was deeply impressed, and initially refused the German request to hand over Giraud. However, the German's second request was accompanied by threats of serious consequences if Vichy refused.

Malta, 3rd (Reuters) - Officials announced that Axis aircraft attacked Malta on Friday, with two being destroyed and two damaged. Air raid sirens sounded twice in Malta last night as Axis aircraft flew in to drop bombs.

Malta, 2nd (Havas) - Air raid sirens sounded twice here tonight, but only a few aircraft infiltrated the city's airspace and dropped bombs. Furthermore, an official communique today stated that two aircraft were shot down during the bombing of the island yesterday, and two were damaged.

### Bulgaria Mobilizes Jews

Sofia, 2nd (Havas) - Bulgarian authorities announced that according to the National Defense Law, all Jews between the ages of twenty and forty-six must be mobilized by the fifteenth of this month and placed under the command of the Ministry of Public Works to undertake railway construction work.

### Mandalay Short Notes

Mandalay, also known as Wa City, is the old capital of Burma. Although the bustle of its streets does not match that of Rangoon, it is still the second most important city. Since it was taken over by the British in 1886, it has taken on a continental flavor after rectification. There are cement Western-style buildings and large buildings with electric lights and fans everywhere; at the same time, there are also low, damp wooden houses and thatched huts on stilts - the former are the homes of the rich, and the latter are the slums of the poor.

The streets of Mandalay, like those of Rangoon, are wide, some paved with stone slabs and others with asphalt roads. It is the commercial hub of Upper Burma, with railways radiating in all directions. The Irrawaddy River flows downstream. Street transportation includes cars, trams, rickshaws, horse-drawn carriages, and bicycles. The traffic is congested, and the Burmese police at the crossroads are busy.

Mandalay is a Burmese name, meaning "Light of a Hundred Treasures," how poetic! The great British writer Kipling said, "Mandalay is the elephant and peacock of Burma, the beautiful city of gold and red vermillion," it must be full of bright and pleasing colors and a magnificent mood. The solemn city walls reflect the golden sunset, the wide moats reflect the sapphire-blue water, and the majestic palaces and glittering spires are nestled in evergreen forests.

The royal palace is in the city, divided into the front hall, middle hall, back hall, and side east and west palaces, with a towering watchtower, but it is all made of wood and is very crude. Compared with modern medium-sized buildings, it is quite backward.

The most revered is the Arakan Buddha, called "Puye Zhi" in Burmese. The temple is tall and surrounded by countless pagodas. Shoes must be removed to enter the temple, and there are two paths to the Buddha's seat. The Buddha is called Maha Myat Munt, said to have been moved from Yomaho.

Mandalay has fallen, and how many vicissitudes has this city gone through! (Hao)

### Banque de l'Indochine Commences Withdrawals Today - No Decision Yet on Third Withdrawal from Chase Bank

Banque de l'Indochine will reopen this morning and begin paying each depositor an initial withdrawal amount of 2,000 yuan from the funds frozen since December 6 of last year. However, Allied depositors are limited to withdrawing 500 yuan per person per week, while depositors from other countries can withdraw the full amount at once. The rumor that the bank had begun withdrawals on the morning of May 1st was found to be untrue.

Withdrawal Amount

According to a bank employee who spoke to reporters, Banque de l'Indochine has not been completely closed since the outbreak of the Pacific War. In fact, the bank was the first to reopen immediately after the war. From December 10 to 16 of last year, the bank continued to operate for six full days and processed limited withdrawals, with a maximum of 1,500 yuan per account. Depositors who withdrew funds during those six days will have their initial withdrawal amount, now permitted, affected. The funds withdrawn during those six days will also be included in the initial withdrawal amount, so most of the deposits that can be withdrawn at present are only 500 yuan.

Time Limit

The bank's business hours are from 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM, which seems very limited. Therefore, a new method has been decided: those whose surnames begin with the letters A to K can withdraw on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, and those whose surnames begin with the letters L to Z can withdraw on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays, to avoid crowding and delays. Although this measure does not mean that any depositor who does not withdraw according to the method will be rejected, the bank especially requests that all depositors comply with this method. Banque de l'Indochine is being liquidated by the Japanese-owned Bank of Korea, and has been closed since the liquidation was announced. After this reopening, the total number of Allied banks that have resumed business after liquidation will reach ten. Chase Bank has not yet processed the third withdrawal. A reporter recently visited an employee of the bank, who said that no formal decision has been made on this matter, but the bank is expected to begin payments in the near future.

### Dachung United Coal Company Allots Coal Dust

Small and large mechanized briquette factories have benefited greatly since the Dachung United Coal Company took charge of supplying them with the raw materials they need to make briquettes daily. They have received deliveries of raw materials (coal dust) several times, but the amounts received by each factory have varied considerably. The amount allotted now depends on the size of the factory's briquette production. Those who need the company to supply coal dust must complete the registration procedures and pay the fees by the specified date, otherwise, it will be considered abandonment. The company has now scheduled to distribute this period's coal dust on the 10th of this month. Those who have completed the registration and paid the fees can present their receipts and pick up the goods from the designated warehouses starting on that day. It is understood that the coal dust allocated to the factory owners by the company is supplied by the Japanese authorities, mostly He Ling dust and Gu Ba dust from Korea. Although the quality is slightly lower than Hongji dust, it can still be used to make briquettes.

### Three Religions Societies Relieve Hidden Poverty - Red Swastika Corn Transports to Yuyao

The Three Religions Moral Benevolent Council continues to assist impoverished and helpless refugees and send them back to their hometowns to assist the population evacuation from the concessions for the benefit of the population, and the relief for hidden poverty also continues. Recently, they have also printed and distributed food stamps to provide biscuits made from corn flour to benefit the poor. The situation in Yuyao is very peaceful, but there are many poor people, and the life they lead, with three meals divided into nine bites, is commonplace. Recently, the Southeast Office of the World Red Swastika Society in this city plans to provide relief to these poor people and has decided to allocate more than 3,000 bags of broken wheat to Yuyao for disaster relief. Because the export of miscellaneous grains requires formal procedures, the Society is currently requesting assistance from relevant parties and should be able to start transporting the goods soon. This Society was once a large-scale benevolent organization in the country, and its greatest goal is purely to relieve human disasters. When there was a food shortage in Ningbo last year, the Society also transported fire-milled corn to distribute.

### French Concession to Establish Police Telephone System - Calls Can Be Made in Seconds

The French Police Department announced in an official statement the other day that an independent street telephone system will soon be installed in the French Concession for the exclusive use of French Police Department personnel. Once installed, officers on duty can communicate with the police station without going through the central dispatch center in case of an emergency. Any police station or the central dispatch center of the French Police Department can also use it to communicate with officers on duty at various intersections. This telephone system can establish calls within seconds, so it will be more effective in dealing with emergency police matters.

### Robbery Case Adjudicated

The Gu residence at No. 7, Lane 510, Rue Amiral Courbet, was broken into by several robbers at around 8:00 AM on the 5th of last month. They drew out handguns, intimidated the mistress Mrs. Gu to prevent her from raising an alarm, and stole valuables worth more than 500 yuan. The maid (from Shaoxing), Xia Li, was suspected of being an inside accomplice because her paramour, Xia Fuhai, was an undesirable element. The patrolmen of the French Municipal Police, arrested a member of the gang, Wu A'gen from Wuxi, along with a handgun, two bullets, and Xia Li, and sent them to the court. Yesterday, Wu A'gen was sentenced to five years in prison, and the handgun and bullets were confiscated. Xia Li was released.

### The Significance and Thoughts on the Chinese Drug Exhibition (Part 1)

— Lecture by Dr. Liu Cuigong

Mr. Wang Xingyi, a Doctor of Biology from France, and Dr. Wu Yunrui, a professor of physiology at Aurora University Medical School, are holding a Chinese drug exhibition at the Aurora Museum in Shanghai. Since its opening, local newspapers have frequently published news about the exhibition. Today's broadcast aims to reach audiences who do not pay much attention to newspapers or who cannot access them. Furthermore, the reasons for holding the exhibition and the impressions after visiting it have been rarely documented in newspapers. Therefore, what I will discuss today will focus on these two points.

There are three reasons why the Aurora Museum held this exhibition this year: First, the stock of European and American medicines is gradually decreasing, and new supplies are difficult to obtain. We should study Chinese medicines to replace European and American drugs. Holding a Chinese drug exhibition can arouse the interest of scientists in research. Second, there are few new magazines and books in Shanghai now, and everyone gradually feels a lack of spiritual food. Holding a drug exhibition, along with exhibiting other parts of the museum, is also a beneficial pastime for the people of Shanghai. Third, this year marks the centenary of the Catholic Church's mission in Shanghai. Aurora University is taking this opportunity to hold a Chinese medicine exhibition, on the one hand, to show that the Catholic Church has always served the local community, and on the other hand, to show that the Church has always embraced a spirit of research into Chinese culture.

Why is the exhibition held at the museum? Although we just said that it is because it includes the opening of other parts, this is not the main reason. To understand the main reason, we must first talk about the Aurora Museum itself. Perhaps not many people in Shanghai know about the Aurora Museum, but this museum has a history of seventy-three years and is the oldest museum in Shanghai. Why do so few people in Shanghai know about it? One of the reasons is that the museum used to be in Xujiahui and was called the Xuhui Museum. It was only ten years ago that it was moved to Route Luba and renamed the Lingzhe Museum because the old location was not enough for development. The French name is Musie Heued, because the founder was Father Heued. This priest made great contributions to the museum, collecting various specimens for 30 years. During these thirty years, he traveled China and the islands of Southeast Asia for a total of 250,000 kilometers (equivalent to circling the earth six times). This priest specialized in the study of mollusks and discovered nearly six hundred previously undocumented species of mollusks in his lifetime. The last three directors were all entomologists, so the research on entomology in the museum is now particularly developed. In the past seventy years, more than eight hundred new insects have been discovered, and the research work is thriving. The museum building is magnificent and well-lit, with many collections of Chinese antiques, minerals, plants, and animals, as well as a rich collection of books. This time, the museum is using all the specimens, antiques, and books, and cooperating with various academic groups and several large pharmacies to create a successful academic exhibition on Chinese materia medica.

What is materia medica? We also have to say a few words: Materia medica is the pharmacopoeia of Chinese medicine. The oldest Chinese materia medica is the "Shen Nong Ben Cao Jing" published in the Han Dynasty, which contains 365 kinds of medicines. Tao Hongjing of the Liang Dynasty doubled the number of medicines. Li Shizhen of the Ming Dynasty wrote "Compendium of Materia Medica" in fifty-two volumes. Zhao Xuemin of the Qing Dynasty added ten volumes of "Supplements", dividing them into categories such as water, fire, earth, metal, stone, grass, grain, vegetable, fruit, wood, scale, shell, bird, beast, and human. "Compendium of Materia Medica" and "Supplements" contain 2,400 kinds of minerals, plants, and animals, with plants accounting for more than 50% of the total, and herbs being the most numerous, hence the name "materia medica." The efficacy of the medicines recorded in the materia medica is sometimes correct and sometimes far-fetched. It must be greatly and scientifically organized before it can be applied. Let's take an herb as an example. It must go through three processes before clinical trials can be conducted. First, botanists must identify what category it belongs to and what its scientific name is. Second, chemists must analyze its effective components. Third, pharmacologists must conduct pharmacological tests before it can be handed over to physicians. This is very evident in this exhibition. We know that the organizers of this exhibition are Father Wang Xingyi, who is also a botanical expert and a Doctor of Biology from France. He has been studying Chinese medicinal plants in China for more than five years and has already written several books on Chinese medicine. The other is Dr. Wu Yunrui, who is a physiologist. Dr. Wu has been studying Chinese materia medica for nearly six years. Five years ago, he and his assistant invented Xianhecao Su (Agrimophol), which is very effective in stopping bleeding and strengthening the heart. These two experts, one a botanical expert and the other a pharmacologist, with the help of other experts, were able to successfully organize the Chinese medicine exhibition, which can be said to be an unprecedented exhibition in Shanghai.

### Prominent Local Figures and Elders Commemorate Han Guojun Yesterday; Surviving Manuscripts of Shen Xinqing, Ling Zhizhi, etc., Totaling Over a Hundred Individuals, Have Been Collected and Are Currently Being Published

Following the passing of Hai'an Weizishi, prominent figures and elders in this city held a public memorial service at the Jing'an Temple. Yesterday afternoon at 4 PM, friends and former colleagues of Mr. Han gathered at the Peidong Building to commemorate him. Those in attendance included over a hundred individuals such as Zhang Boch, Pang Diancai, Pan Hongding, Xu Xuanwu, Dong Boxiang, Xia Jiyu, Liang Shoushan, Yuan Xiluo, Ling Zhizhi, Su Houqing, Pang Mengtao, Sun Choucheng, Lu Guiliang, Shen Jie, Wang Xihou, Deng Hancheng, Shen Xinqing, Xin Yixiang, Cheng Chang, Chen Baochu, Zhu Dexuan, and Xie Feiqing. Shen Xinqing was appointed as the chief officiant, with Ling Zhizhi, Chen Baochu, Yuan Xiluo, and Lu Guiliang assisting in the ceremony, and Xu Xuanwu and Xie Feiqing accompanying. The memorial service began at 4 PM, with Jin Jushan serving as the master of ceremonies. Zhu Dexuan first delivered the opening remarks, explaining the significance of the memorial service, followed by the official ceremony. After the ceremony and reading of the eulogy, Pang Diancai reported on Mr. Han's life and deeds, emphasizing his integrity, sincerity, dedication to governance, and commitment to water conservancy, among other great achievements. He was praised as a role model in every aspect, with his character becoming even more steadfast in his later years, making him a truly complete person of his time. Yuan Xiluo and Ling Zhizhi then delivered speeches, highly praising Mr. Han's moral character and literary accomplishments. Finally, Ms. Liu Xian, the daughter of Mr. Han, delivered a speech of gratitude, concluding the ceremony. Furthermore, it was learned that Mr. Han's poems and articles have been collected and compiled for publication by his disciple, Pang Diancai. The chronological biography is currently ready for publication.

### Rice Shops in Both Concessions Receive Corn Sales Permits; Tongyi and Other Five Warehouses Released Rice Yesterday; Rice Shops Will Continue to Sell Foreign Rice Today

The Rice and Grain Office of the Municipal Council designated the Taikoo, Zhejiang Xingye, Huishan Hwasheng, Tongyi, and other five warehouses to supply foreign rice for rice shops to collect. Although yesterday was Sunday, rice was still released as usual to supply today's demand. The quantity restriction remained the same, with each person allowed to purchase rice worth two yuan and nine jiao in national currency.

Receiving Corn Permits

Three hundred and seventy-two rice shops in both concessions will continue to receive corn sales permits from the Rice Management Committee today, which involves paying the Rice Office. Starting tomorrow, they will begin collecting corn from the Lihe Warehouse at 195 Suzhou Road. The quantity allocated to each rice shop will remain the same, with the retail restriction remaining at one and a half sheng per person, sold at two yuan and two jiao in national currency.

Increasing the Number of Rice Shops

There is no relaxation of restrictions on the quantity of foreign rice sold by rice shops. However, the possibility of increasing the number of rice shops is being considered by the Concession authorities, which is hoped to be realized. This is expected to alleviate the current crowded conditions and benefit the general public. Rice shops continue to extend their rice selling hours to ensure universal access.

### Municipal Council Budget for This Year (4)

Health Department General and Hospitals, 4,014,820 yuan. The Health Department's budget includes several proposed changes, the main purpose of which is to reduce the operating losses of the Lester Chinese Hospital, which is managed by the Council. This plan includes the following items:

Relocating the nursing staff of the Lester Chinese Hospital from the Victoria Nursing Home to the Lester Chinese Hospital.

Relocating the Foreign Isolation Hospital from its current temporary address on the Great Western Road to the Victoria Nursing Home.

Relocating the tuberculosis ward from the Country Hospital to the Victoria Nursing Home. As a result of the foregoing, the Health Department's expenditure in the budget will increase, but the donations and grants in future budgets will decrease. After the proposed economic management measures for the Lester Chinese Hospital are implemented, the Council will be able to reduce subsidies and save on Council expenses.

The budget does not include expenses for dealing with actual or potential infectious diseases or emergency measures. Public Health and Donations and Subsidies to Non-Council Hospitals, 1,723,810 yuan. This expenditure is 590,440 yuan more than last year. The Lester and Country Hospitals are expected to incur deficits of 748,130 yuan and 156,490 yuan respectively, which are 416,050 yuan and 45,640 yuan more than in 1940. The Lester Chinese Hospital has recently implemented economic management measures. The funds required to accommodate impoverished patients with neurological and other ailments are 28,940 yuan more than last year. The funds set aside for subsidizing non-Council hospitals are 3,00 yuan more than last year. Although the Municipal Surtax will increase from July 1 this year, the exempted hospital donations will decrease slightly, by 2,790 yuan. This is because the right to collect surtax on roads outside the Western District has been transferred to the Shanghai Special Municipality, so the Lester Chinese Hospital has been removed from the surtax register.

Public Works Department, 13,163,400 yuan. To reduce the use of materials and meet the need to strive for thrift, the Director of the Public Works Department has proposed general savings, estimated to save 969,900 yuan, of which 642,800 yuan will be saved by the department itself. The savings measures proposed by the Director include: (1) Cancelling all internal decoration, which can save 340,000 yuan, including 12,000 yuan for the department's own decoration; (2) Cancelling all external painting, which can save 99,900 yuan; (3) Reducing all building maintenance costs, which can save 200,000 yuan; and (4) Reducing street lighting costs, which can save 330,000 yuan.

The above items, together with salary reductions for staff and other savings measures, have been adopted in the budget.

Municipal Orchestra, 251,600 yuan (five months' expenses). The question of whether the orchestra should be retained has been raised at the Annual Ratepayers' Meeting more than once since the orchestra was first organized in 1936. The most recent proposal was in the past year, at which time the Council adopted the recommendations of the Economic Committee, stating that the question should be left to the ratepayers to decide.

The contracts of the orchestra's musicians have been adjusted so that their service period ends on May 31 each year, so that if the decision is made to disband the orchestra when the symphonic concert season ends, it can be done accordingly.

In view of the current situation, whether the citizens are able to support the orchestra has become a matter for consideration. In terms of the Council's current financial situation, there is no reason to continue to maintain the orchestra. The Council has now decided to disband the orchestra from May 31 this year. Therefore, the amount listed in the budget is only for the orchestra's expenses for five months. The existing orchestra will soon be taken over by a Japanese music trust.

Public Library, 101,520 yuan, 4,180 yuan more than last year's budget. The Council has adopted the recommendations of the Library Committee that it should only purchase essential new books at present, and not try to expand the library.

Finance Department (including the Tax Department and Compradore Office), 3,770,040 yuan, 644,130 yuan more than last year's budget.

The income from tuition fees for the autumn term of 1941, with 1,289 students in Western schools and 8,448 students in Chinese schools, has been included in the budget in accordance with the current revised tuition fee amounts. Since September last year, the surcharge charged by Western schools has increased from 150% to 316%. It was originally approved that 20% of this increased income should be allocated to subsidize impoverished students. This year's budget includes an increase to 40% from January 1 this year.

The subsidies for foreign and Chinese schools are budgeted for at whole numbers of 625,000 each.

President's Office, 90,12.0 yuan, 101,640 yuan less than last year's budget. Part of the reason for the reduction is that the Director-General and President, whose salary was entirely calculated in British pounds, has resigned.

Industrial and Social Affairs Department, 369,190 yuan, 81,140 yuan more than last year's budget. The department's social services are of obvious value, especially at the present time.

Legal Department, 378,750 yuan, 32,290 yuan less than last year's budget.

Chinese Affairs Department, 146,510 yuan, 24,080 yuan more than last year's budget.

Education Department, 4,763,090 yuan. Regarding this year's budget for the department, the first important and noteworthy point is that the method of preparing the education budget separately from the general budget for the past few years has been abolished this year. Certain expenditures of the department, such as pensions and other retirement benefits, building maintenance and ordinary repair costs, rent for leased buildings, and interest and accounting fees, have been included in the corresponding items of the general budget. Secondly, the principle adopted by the Council in 1934 to limit the allocation of education funds, whereby the allocation should be equal to two per cent of the total Municipal Surtax and its equivalent proportion of land tax, has now been deemed inappropriate by the Special Education Committee and has been abolished.

The need to abolish the foregoing principle can be seen from last year's budget. The education expenditure for that year was allocated according to the two per cent limitation, resulting in a significant shortfall in the education budget and a substantial surplus in the general budget. For the sake of economy, the Council decided to merge the Council Public Hanbury Western Boys' School and the Western District Western Public School. The budget has been adjusted in accordance with this decision. Two teachers who were previously transferred to the Merchant Corps have now returned to their original schools, and their salaries have been included in the budget.

Budget increase or decrease for the 1942 academic year:

978 students, decrease of 3,118.848 students, increase of 400 yuan. The amount of subsidy will be decided later. The subsidies for foreign and Chinese schools listed last year were 495,000 yuan and 605,000 yuan respectively.

Ordinary Expenses, 7,444,820 yuan. This amount is 1,917,270 yuan less than last year. The amounts for ordinary expenses are as follows:

(A) Expenses outside of departments, 3,900,660 yuan. This expenditure includes expenses for food control etc. of 2,000,000 yuan, miscellaneous expenses of the Committee for the Study of Unequal Tax Laws of 643.80 yuan, expenses for retail tax inspection of 400,000 yuan, expenses for population survey of 200,000 yuan, expenses for signal service for half a year of 117,260 yuan, expenses for repatriating Chinese of 100,000 yuan, and other smaller amounts for rent appraisal, miscellaneous expenses of the Board of Appeal of the New Appraisal, auditing fees, legal advice fees, and insurance funds. The cost of employing agents in London and New York by the Council is not included in the budget. The expenses for food control etc. are budgeted for at 2,000,000 yuan. This amount can be slightly reduced due to the income from the sale of rice and flour. The expenses for slightly expanding the food control affairs have been included in the amount listed in the budget for several months. However, the salaries of the staff transferred from various departments to handle food control affairs are not included in the budget because the future situation is uncertain and cannot be accurately estimated at this time. It is expected that the actual expenditure for handling food control affairs by the end of the year will exceed 2,00,000 yuan. However, the salaries paid to council employees who are finally reassigned as regular staff for handling food control affairs will not affect the budget, because the salaries of these employees have already been included in the budgets of their original departments, and the amounts should be sufficient to offset them.

### Gu Qingtang Accused of Abandonment; Relatives and Friends Mediate

Gu Qingtang, a staff member of the Guohua Bank and a native of Suzhou, married Pan Yonglin, the daughter of a wealthy Pan family, in the early winter of the twentieth year of the Republic of China. For more than a decade, their relationship was very strong. Gu repeatedly asked his wife to borrow money from her parents' family for business, amounting to more than 100,000 yuan, only borrowing and not repaying. In the summer of last year, Gu asked his wife for another loan, but was refused by Ms. Pan, resulting in a breakdown in the relationship between husband and wife.

Love Broken

Ms. Pan asked Gu to repay the loans. Gu signed two checks from the Guohua Bank, each for 50,000 yuan, dated July 31 and September 30 of the following year. Unexpectedly, when Ms. Pan presented the last check to the bank for cashing, it was dishonored due to insufficient funds. When she sought repayment from Gu, she was beaten and humiliated. Gu left home and never returned, and stopped providing household expenses for half a year. It was not until December of last year that Ms. Pan discovered that her husband

Was Having an Affair with a Famous Prostitute

Xu Moxian, known as Lao Si at Zuihong Villa, was living with him at No. 2, Lane 1412, Xiafei Road. Gu treated Ms. Pan like an old fan in autumn. In response, Ms. Pan, citing her husband's malicious abandonment and the impossibility of growing old together, hired a lawyer to file for divorce and demand compensation for alimony until the age of sixty, mental distress compensation of 200,000 yuan, and repayment of the 100,000 yuan loan. The details have been reported in the newspapers. It is now heard that after this matter was published in the newspapers, relatives and friends of both parties learned about it. Believing that the two parties should not go to extremes, resulting in misfortune, they stepped in to mediate between the two parties. Whether a peaceful resolution can be reached is currently unknown.

### Two Horse-Drawn Carriages

This is another two-wheeled carriage, very light and fast. The carriage is padded with sofas, with a wooden board in front. The whole body is painted milky white, and it is undoubtedly beautiful in appearance. This kind of carriage is most suitable for the owner to personally pull the reins. When the sound of hooves gallops in the depths of the green shade, looking around at the street scene is a different kind of interest than sitting in a car.

### Newly Opened Tobacco Shops Spring Up Like Bamboo Shoots

Since the beginning of this year, many new tobacco shops have opened, like bamboo shoots after a rain. At a time when industry and commerce are declining, this abnormal development is deeply surprising. These newly opened tobacco shops mainly engage in the wholesale of cigarettes, cigars, soap, candles, and matches. Those that have already opened include Wantai Tobacco Shop on Carter Road, Fuxing Tobacco Shop, Mingji Tobacco Shop at No. 333 Avenue Road, Hengyu Tobacco Shop at the intersection of Ningbo Road and Shanxi Road, Guangyi Tobacco Shop at No. 9 Guizhou Road on Nanjing Road, Guanghua Tobacco Shop at the north end of Sichuan Road and Wuma Road, Yuanfeng Xing on Parker Road, Dinghe Tobacco Shop at No. 145 Zhejiang Road, and Xiangsheng Tobacco Shop on Beijing Road. Among them, Xiangsheng Tobacco Shop is the largest in scale, followed by Wantai Tobacco Shop. It is said that there are still many others that will soon be established.

### Wife of Robbery Suspect Demands Release of Her Husband

Chinese Detectives Feng Baishun and Huang Fusen of the Criminal Police Station previously arrested a large number of well-dressed and absurd youths at places such as Yu Qiaqing Road, Jue Lu, Yuan Dong, Meng Jian Hotel, etc., and took into custody more than ten members of the gang of robbers Yu Shirong and Wang Jusheng, and suspect Yin Xiaodi, a youth from Wusong. They confiscated two pistols and more than ten bullets. These people had, between January and March of this year, robbed residents and pedestrians from Xinzha Road in the north to Avenue Edward VII in the south, from Mendelan Road in the west to Zhili Road in the east, committing a total of seven cases and consuming property worth more than 30,000 yuan in dance halls, casinos, and restaurants. Yesterday, Wang Baozhen, the wife of suspect Yin Xiaodi, a youth from Wusong, claimed that her husband, Yin Xiaodi, was a young student. At that time, my husband and I came to Shanghai from our hometown to buy clothing materials and stayed in Room 307 of the Mengyuan Hotel. On March 18, we had lunch at the Zhuangyuanlou Restaurant. We happened to meet the defendant, Tang Wenxiong, from the same hometown, and borrowed a pen from him. I didn't know that he had stolen it from a pedestrian on Mendelan Road. I request that my husband be released, etc. The court hearing approved a date for sentencing on the 6th.

### Savings and Hoarding

— Xu Ji

In the current situation of alarmingly high prices, for an average family, after covering the needs of several mouths and bodies (clothing, housing), if they can still have a surplus of three to five dollars for savings, it can honestly be considered fortunate among ordinary families. However, in the past year or two, for these "fortunate families," especially those "clever" housewives who think they are being smart, "saving" has practically become synonymous with being foolish. Indeed, in these days of rapidly depreciating currency and skyrocketing prices, ancient teachings like "planning ahead" have become outdated nonsense. And those "smart" family members who have "a few coins" in hand, from the older generation to the younger generation, and even the servants, are using the money to buy goods for "hoarding." The hoarded goods include soap, toilet paper, kerosene, matches, as well as newsprint, quinine, aspirin, undershirts, socks... all sorts of things, nothing is too strange. These "household hoarders" have a rather interesting contradiction in their psychology: they were originally a group of pure consumers who desperately desired lower prices for general goods, but once they bought a certain item (even a small bar of soap), they immediately hoped that the price of that item would rise day and night. A rise of one or two cents would bring comfort, a rise of ten or twenty cents, or even one or two dollars, would bring beaming smiles. But even at that point, they remain pure consumers. I met a domestic helper who, with a year's worth of hard-earned $120, dared to hoard 100 boxes of matches when the price was $1.20 per box. In her eyes, she probably thought that in the near future, the price of matches would rise to $3 or $5 per box, right? If you buy matches and she buys soap... how can prices not rise? And as a family member who cannot escape the status of a pure consumer, even if they make a profit on a few items, they still have to cope with the soaring prices of everything else. As a social phenomenon, this is truly a laughable form of foolishness.

I don't want to write an advertisement for savings banks here, so I won't try to sell the "benefits" of saving. But what we need to clarify is whether hoarding goods at home can really be profitable? Based on the facts I have personally seen and heard, the answer is completely negative.

The motives for hoarding goods at home are nothing more than: (A) buying and selling for profit, and (B) purchasing for personal use to prevent price increases. But for both of these points, hoarding goods at home can be said to be of no benefit. Regarding item "A," I believe that there is no profit to be made from hoarding goods in the home for the following reasons: 1. As mentioned earlier, making a profit on a few items cannot offset the rise in the prices of everything else; 2. Small quantities of goods are difficult to sell due to manipulation by large hoarders; 3. Using brokers or agents is essentially making a profit for them, and sometimes even requires selling goods at a loss; 4. Without proper storage facilities, goods can easily spoil. If the stored items are flammable, such as matches and kerosene, they not only pose a greater risk than storing them in proper storage facilities, but they are also subject to prohibitions and can suffer severe losses; 5. It may not be possible to convert goods into cash when needed, and if one is forced to lower prices or even sell at a loss to quickly get rid of the goods, there will be no profit to be made, or even losses incurred; 6. Lack of understanding of market conditions and blindly following the crowd is like a blind person riding a blind horse, and disaster is almost inevitable for this kind of household investment.

Secondly, regarding item (B), hoarding daily necessities at home for personal use is also not cheaper in reality, because: 1. Having more leads to using more, which increases consumption; 2. Goods spoil over time; 3. It is difficult to check a large quantity of stored goods, which inevitably leads to leakage by servants; 4. If there are prohibited items among the daily necessities (such as matches, kerosene, etc.), being discovered will inevitably lead to unexpected losses.

Therefore, the conclusion we reach is that using household savings to hoard goods is not as "much smarter than saving" as some people imagine.

### Rumors Shattered, Truth Revealed: Yarn Prices Turn Weak

In the past week, the yarn market continued its past trends, without breaking away from the pattern of large price fluctuations. Initially, it soared for several consecutive days, and profits were taken when they were high. However, due to the scarcity of raw cotton and high open market prices, yarn prices rose sharply again under the influence of bullish factors. Prices for all grades of coarse and fine yarns reached unprecedented highs. Later, as rumors subsided and market sentiment turned weak, those holding chips sold off in large quantities, and the market then experienced a downward reversal. The overall situation for the week was characterized by an initial rise followed by a decline, showcasing the full extent of its volatile nature.

On Monday, the yarn market was affected by the dispute over the Tonghe Guli property and was in a state of partial standstill. Some floating positions were closed out at this time, and prices were seen to hover and decline. By Wednesday, bullish news had resurfaced, and activity expanded with financial rumors. Cotton cloth, due to the rising price of East goods and the tightening of supply, attracted fierce hoarding by investors, resulting in a day of trading in the midst of turbulent waves. On Thursday, continuing the momentum of the previous day, prices jumped sharply at the opening. The price of 20-count Shuangma factory singles even reached a high of $5,600, with spot prices reaching $6,670. The price of 20-count Shuangdiqiu reached $6,700, surpassing Shuangma by an even greater margin. The price of 12-pound Dapeng fine cloth also reached $245, with no market supply. The price of 16-pound Diqiu coarse cloth reached $265, breaking all previous records. After Friday, as market rumors gradually cleared up, military notes fell, and profits were taken. Prices then began to decline, but compared to the prices of the previous week, coarse-grade cotton yarn still rose by $200 to $300, medium-grade rose by $200 to $400, and fine yarn rose by $600 to $1,000. The cotton cloth market showed mixed results. In addition to the continued rise in the price of East goods, factory cloth rose by $3 to $5 for coarse goods and $1 to $3 for fine Luo cloth.

Looking back at the rise and fall of yarn prices in the past week, the important factors were various financial and speculative activities, as well as cotton industry issues such as raw material shortages and reduced production in textile factories. Under the influence of these factors, various parties made great efforts to control the market, resulting in continued large fluctuations. As for the future direction, it is difficult to predict. If we temporarily disregard various natural factors and all economic changes, and purely consider the basic conditions of the cotton industry itself, there are still no concrete measures for increasing cotton production and allocation. The activity of Chinese and foreign textile factories will continue to be influenced by the wartime situation. Therefore, with low production and expensive raw materials, it is difficult to underestimate the price of cotton products. However, exports remain hopeless, and speculative hoarding will be influenced by financial trends. Given the recent rumors, which came only a few weeks after the previous wave, it is possible that there will be a period of stability after the recent storm. Therefore, whether prices rise or fall in the near future will depend on the circumstances and whether the market will stabilize.

### Veteran Bulls Lack Strength, Foreign Stocks Squeezed Slightly

In the foreign stock market last week, there were only three trading days in the entire week. The overall trend was still relatively stable, but the process was characterized by an initial rise followed by a decline. As a result, the rise and fall of each stock varied depending on its own environment and supply and demand conditions. The financial rumors at the beginning of the week caused the market to weaken after the rumors subsided. The total number of shares traded in the spot market for the entire week was approximately 150,000 shares.

Looking at each stock individually, textile stocks initially rose with the high price of yarn. For example, Jardine Spinning once reached a high of $46.25, but later fell to $44.25, a decrease of $3 compared to the previous week. The China Textile and Sin Hwa factories were able to stand out due to the support of the factory authorities' announcement of shareholder registration. Among the small-cap stocks, Yibier, Paper, Shanghai Wool, etc. were still the most traded and the most active, with a trend of large gains and small pullbacks. Among the industrial stocks, Jardine Matheson experienced the largest fluctuations, with a low of $96 and a high of $103. For other stocks such as Xiangtai, Asia Navigation, and Yinglian, veteran bulls came out to sell at high prices, so they all showed signs of weakness. Stocks in the financial and public utilities sectors were relatively stable and lacked significant fluctuations. The number of rubber stocks traded decreased significantly, with only Langgezhi being relatively active. The overall situation showed a lack of upward momentum.

Due to strict control of materials and the difficulty of hoarding, there were many concerns, so idle funds were transferred to the stock market. Foreign stocks had a large number of shares and were easily traded, so speculation was more prominent than before. However, once yarn prices fell, they immediately followed suit. Chinese domestic goods and Dashwa still had gains and no losses. The upward momentum of the Dahua Firecracker industrial stock weakened. The new shares of the Shijie Bookstore were initially eagerly absorbed by large investors, pushing the price close to $80. However, due to the excessive rise, large investors who made profits sold off at high prices, and the market price then became unsustainable. Hwa Cheng Tobacco rose by $10. Nanyang Tobacco Company became more active. Both new and old shares of Guanshengyuan rose to $25, appearing to be the most eye-catching. The upward momentum of Wing On Textile remained strong, rising by $20. In the financial sector, City Hua shares were strong. In addition, Portuguese merchants recently established a futures market, making activities more convenient. Therefore, recent price fluctuations and trading volumes have been quite active. However, according to market rumors, the recent rise in foreign stocks, in addition to being stimulated by financial rumors, was also driven by the veteran bulls from before December 8th of last year. These people held bank loans, and the rise before the fourth quarter was a trick to deal with the fourth quarter. If the rumors are true, then in the future, when the objective environment is unlikely to improve, the outlook does not seem to be smooth sailing.

### Chips Control the Chinese Stock Market: Bulls and Bears Compete to Buy Low and Sell High

In the Chinese stock market last week, the upward trend from the previous week continued. However, by Thursday afternoon, the market began to decline as large investors who had made profits began to sell off. Stocks with more circulating shares uniformly fell, while those with equal supply and demand remained stable. Trading volume was not weak as buyers absorbed shares at low prices, especially in industrial stocks. Was this due to the continued rise in prices?

Notably, the biochemistry sector of New Pharmaceutical took off, rising from $21.5 to $25.5. The new shares of New Asia once broke through $37, but quickly fell back. The new shares of Sino-French showed a hovering trend. The chips of Wuzhou Pharmaceutical were exhausted, rising by as much as $17.5. New Asia Science surged by $3. Department stores such as Wing On and Sun Sun initially remained flat but then showed strength, as buyers shifted their attention to them after a long period of calm. The former rose from $51 to $58.5, while the latter rose and fell between $73 and $75. China Underwear's weekly performance was mixed, but the result was stable, with both Mainland and Shanghai rising by $25.

### How Can You Govern the Country If You Can't Govern Your Home? Call for Contributions

The origin of society is the clan, and the study of economics also begins with household financial management. In modern economic thought, "governing the world" is more important than "governing the home." However, at this time and place, "governing the world" is indeed difficult, and "governing the home" is also not easy. The ancients said, "How can you govern the country if you can't govern your home?" Although we have no great ambitions, we can still know the importance of managing a home. In this time of rising prices and widespread poverty, the study of household financial management has a meaning that is by no means trivial. This newspaper has always taken serving society as its mission, so it has long established a family weekly to address general issues of managing a home. Now, we are using a corner of this publication to provide readers with a platform for discussing family economic issues. We hope for cooperation from all sectors, and especially welcome contributions from women, particularly housewives. The topic of the article can be chosen freely, with each article limited to 1,000 words. A payment of $5 to $10 will be given for each article. Please send your contributions directly to the Economic Supplement Department of this newspaper. (Previous topics can be found in the previous issue of this publication.)

After the weakening of the Chinese stock market, many small investors have been selling off one after another, while powerful large investors have been absorbing shares at low prices, creating a situation where the market is difficult to rise but easy to fall. In addition, the number of stock companies operating as agents for buying and selling is increasing, and the number of circulating shares is decreasing accordingly, which is another reason for this situation. In short, today's Chinese stock market is booming, and promoting new shares is an urgent task.

### Clouds and Rain Scatter the Suffering of Shorts: Bond Market Maze

In the bond market last week, the market state was extremely mysterious under the intense competition between the long and short sides; it rose and fell suddenly, with great fluctuations. As a result, the majority of profit-takers came out, creating a high-pressure situation for the short side. By the end of the week, the short side made up for losses and the long side increased their positions, stabilizing the market. But in general, the short side has gained a slight advantage. Type A bonds fell by $3, Type B fell by $2.40, Type C fell by $2.20, Type D fell by $1.50, and Type E fell by $0.90. The total transaction volume for the entire week was about 10 million yuan.

At the beginning of Monday, the seller's new goods did not move, and many people had optimistic hopes. The northern gang came to test the waters first, engaging in purchases, and the market situation once turned firm. But who knew that this was precisely a ploy to lure people in, so as soon as the market price rose, the new goods poured out in large quantities while retail investors did not hesitate to attach themselves to the momentum, throwing out everything regardless of whether they had actual goods or not: Types C and E were their targets; resulting in Type E breaking through four levels in one day. However, the shorts took advantage of the fact that the retail shorts were unprepared and took the opportunity to make up for their losses at low prices; the retail shorts had no actual goods to deliver, how could they hold on for long; and after the retail shorts made up for their losses, the market atmosphere was very tight; Type E's sharp decline was also followed by a rapid rise; and the closing price on the weekend has exceeded Tuesday's record and is even higher than Type D.

Quietly observing the large investors on both the long and short sides. The former is represented by powerful financial institutions, while the latter possesses unfathomable new goods.

### There is Profit Everywhere: The Thousand Faces of Hoarders

What's biting at the heels of the hoarders is not the management of materials, but how to sell them off. As long as one goes through the formalities and applies according to the law, management is no problem. But the thought of who to sell to? That's like looking for a needle in a haystack. Sell to the experts? They'll cut the price. If you don't sell to the experts, then who do you sell to? This is the most common dilemma for hoarders in the past. If this dilemma had not been resolved, the hoarding trend might not have been so rampant!

But Shanghai is not short of clever people. "Giving convenience to others is giving convenience to yourself," this is their secret, and thus a batch of merchants like "public sales houses" have emerged. They advertise in the newspapers to buy and sell hoarded goods on behalf of customers. Those who sell register with them, and those who buy also register with them; they act as intermediaries between those who have and those who don't. This is originally similar to China's inherent brokerage system, but it has been modernized to have the style of a commodity exchange. On the one hand, they solve the problem of where old hoarders can find a way out, and on the other hand, they open the door of convenience for new hoarders. If you have money yourself, then first come, first served. Otherwise, there are indeed great benefits between buying and selling.

The rise of public sales houses has once again opened the minds of general hoarders. When they think about "Why should I give the public sales house a profit from the middle?" they are no longer willing to be fools. So they also go to the newspapers to post a small advertisement, clearly stating the name and price of the goods, and buyers will come to their door. And buyers can also post a solicitation advertisement, clearly stating the name and price of the goods, and sellers will naturally come to their door. So the tricks are getting more and more numerous. If you see that what you are hoarding is falling in price, quickly put up a "high-price solicitation" advertisement, which is a strategy to deliberately let go in order to catch. If you see that what you are hoarding is rising in price, you can also put up a "high-price solicitation" advertisement again, so that it rises even faster. This is adding fuel to the fire. Conversely: if you want to buy something, you might as well post a "cheap sale" advertisement. When buyers come to the door, you can just say "sold out" to respond. This has the effect of intimidating people with a false appearance.

Those who play this trick are mostly small hoarders of pharmaceuticals, stationery, etc. Many large hoarders of cigarettes have specially set up retail stores to release their goods in a different way. They can spend money to rent a store, and sell limited quantities of cigarettes at reduced prices on a regular basis; each person is limited to buying one pack, and sales stop once the quota is sold out each day. This causes crowds of people to surge, and households are penetrated; everyone feels that it is not easy to buy cigarettes, and smokers naturally feel the need to hoard some. This has caused a rising trend in the cigarette market, creating an opportunity for old hoarders to release their goods at high prices. Not only do they cover the costs of the store, but they also make a lot of money themselves. If they intend to continue operating, they can continue to innovate the tricks. Otherwise, selling the store and ending the business is still profitable everywhere.

As the main body; each has its own merits and should not be underestimated. However, the tactics of both sides are extremely cunning, the shorts throw and stop; sometimes pouring out in large quantities, sometimes selling gradually; watching from the sidelines when the price is low. Once they see retail shorts squeezing, they will secretly give some fear; their intention is nothing more than to avoid public attention. The long side, on the other hand, harbors the ambition to absorb all new goods, but is afraid of being known by the other side; so they secretly and cautiously absorb, sometimes buying and sometimes stopping, with this strength supporting the debt market, it will not be discouraged. If the new goods are exhausted, then the prosperous situation will be in sight; what cannot be determined is how many positions there are? And when will it be able to spit them all out?

### Taking the Blame for Being Gullible: Rumors in the Currency Market

In the past few weeks, military notes have been in a weak position, hovering near the 7 yuan level, and there was a possibility that they would not be able to hold on. Last Wednesday, there were suddenly rumors of raising the listed price of savings notes; the reason for this was probably that the general bulls could not bear the long-term困困. On the other hand, there seemed to be suspicion of banks manipulating the market. General retail investors could not distinguish between fact and fiction, and took the rumor as truth upon hearing it; even more self-righteous people thought it was something expected; and thought that if savings notes rose, military notes would also rise; so with the spread of the rumor, the price of cloth blindly rose. However, by the end of the quarter (i.e. Thursday), the authorities made no move; in addition, the end of each month is the time for issuing new wages, and military notes and savings notes are inherently weak. Once the bubble bursts, the consequences can be imagined. The old bulls, who have been trapped for a long time, took advantage of the high price to come out; the general investors then realized they had been tricked, and desperately threw out their goods, causing the price to plummet, resulting in substantial losses.

### Several Internationally Famous "Pandas"

— Ba Du

New York Electric Dispatch, October 29th: Mrs. Chiang Kai-shek gifted two pandas to American children, which have already been named: the female is called "Ban Da," and the male is called "Ban Di." Speaking of pandas, they are truly one of the rarest and most precious animals in the world.

The panda's English name is Panda, so this "Ban Da" refers to them. The scientific name is Ailuropoda melanoleuca (David), a precious mammal. It was first discovered on the border of Tibet in China in 1876 by a famous church biologist named David.

Later, in 1914, Dr. Weigold and his assistant, Mr. Stutzner, hunted a young panda in Tibet, but unfortunately, it died soon after. They later obtained several specimens with only bones and fur for the Berlin Museum, which were also highly valued.

In 1928, the two Roosevelt brothers, Kermit and Theodore, came to China for a hunting trip and personally saw living pandas in Western China. They hunted one at that time.

From that time on, the panda's fame has attracted the attention of zoologists around the world. Major zoos are willing to spend huge sums of money in the hope of obtaining a living panda.

The panda currently in the Chicago Zoo in the United States can be said to be a pioneer in this regard. It was the first panda to go abroad to America. When it crossed the ocean from China to the New World, it was only a few months old, and its owner was Mrs. Harkness. At that time, everyone was very excited to hear the news of a living panda. The time was 1936.

This panda is female and is called "Show Ling." It is said that it is still kept in the Brookfield Zoo in Chicago.

In mid-July 1937, two pandas obtained by Smith in Western China, one of which was female, were transported to the United States. That panda was called "Ginny," weighed two hundred pounds, and had a very strong build. At that time, Smith also hunted a male panda, weighing about four hundred pounds, and originally wanted to transport it to America together, but unfortunately, it was injured and poisoned in Chongqing and died soon after.

The London Zoo also has two pandas, one called "Tang" and the other called "Ming." They are also very popular in the zoo. The famous British cartoonist Luo has drawn several sketches of them and published them in newspapers. As a result, toys, clothing, food, and other items use "Panda" as a symbol, and there is no end to them.

The panda's body is stout and full, its movements are funny and cute, and its fur is black and white. Its two ears and two eyes are black, set off by a white head, which makes people feel very fond of it. They love to eat bamboo and vegetables, and their lives can be said to be very simple.

In the museum on Museum Road in this city, there are panda specimens on display. Readers who are interested may wish to visit.

### The Flying Doctors of Australia

— He Kai

The population of Australia totals seven million people, most of whom are concentrated in the cities along the southeastern coast, where the climate is good. For example, Sydney has 1.3 million people, Melbourne has 1 million, Adelaide and Brisbane have 300,000, and Perth in Western Australia has 200,000. There are three or four other cities with populations of 100,000 or 50,000. The remaining half of the population lives in remote areas far from the cities, engaged in resource development.

This population of less than four million is scattered over a vast land area of 2.97 million square miles. It is not difficult to imagine the sparseness of the population. It is very common for the nearest neighbors to be dozens of miles apart. People living in these remote areas cannot easily get a doctor even if they become ill. Therefore, the "flying doctors" have emerged in Australia. The so-called "flying doctors" refer to doctors who travel by plane to provide medical care. People living in remote areas are mostly equipped with short-wave wireless telegraphs. Once they encounter illness, they use foot-powered generators to generate electricity and send out distress signals. The person who receives this signal somewhere immediately informs the airport with airplanes taking off and landing, and then the doctor flies to the patient's location. When the patient's condition is serious, the patient must be transported to the city for hospitalization. The fact that doctors travel by plane for medical treatment alone is enough to prove the vastness and sparseness of Australia.

### My Brother — A Fighter in the Family —

— Zang Ling

My brother is only twenty-four years old this year. His eyes are deeply sunken, his body is thin and weak, he doesn't like to talk, and there are several deep wrinkles across his forehead.

I love my brother very much, although he doesn't treat me warmly on the outside and sometimes scolds me.

After graduating from high school, he went to work as a clerk in a foreign company here. Later, the house was destroyed by gunfire, and my father and I fled there. So, my brother rented a small room and lived with us. Soon, he also got me into high school.

It was a Saturday afternoon. There were no classes at school very early. I walked home with a happy mood.

Soon, my brother also came back, but our conversation brought me sadness.

"Is Father out?" he asked.

"Just left," I replied in the simplest words.

"Did he lose money at the gambling house again yesterday?!" He frowned, making the lines on his forehead very deep.

"I don't know."

"I think this kind of life can't be maintained for another year." My brother said dejectedly, "He only knows how to spend, not how to produce. -- Think about it, he needs a tin of cigarettes every day." As he spoke, he turned to look at the many cigarette cans that had accumulated high on the windowsill, "And he still gambles!"

"He has already said that he is just getting by these days." My brother continued, "In April this year, the company is recruiting female employees. Are you going to try it?" This sudden question really made me not know how to answer. "Oh! Me?" I couldn't go on. A wave of blackness flashed before my eyes.

"I'm afraid it's impossible to finish high school!" My brother seemed to know what I meant, and then everyone fell silent.

The terrible April finally came, but my brother didn't ask me to take the company's exam. When I couldn't help but question him, he only said to me: "Good child, don't worry! Your brother will always find a way for you to finish high school." Secretly, I shed a few hot tears.

A few days later, I got news that my brother was going to work in an illegitimate organization (a gambling den or something). I felt extremely painful. I never thought that my beloved brother would also become a person whose soul had fallen. I began to hate him, curse him. I said that even if he only had this thought and didn't have such actions, he was already an impure young man. I wanted to warn him, dissuade him, but when I saw his sad face, I didn't dare to bring up unpleasant things.

Recently, my brother has become even thinner and coughs constantly. He has to get up at 6:00 in the morning every day to transcribe manuscripts for a bookstore, and after dinner, he works as a private tutor near the foreign company. When he gets home, he still has to finish copying the remaining manuscripts. And my handwriting is so bad that it is impossible for me to help even a little. In this way, my brother always has to work more than fourteen hours a day.

My brother is struggling with death, shouldn't Father know? But what about him? Isn't he still joking with his age every day? My brother wants to "use the spirit of labor to influence him." But what is the result?

A few days ago, Father got drunk and started chatting with me on a whim. Talking about my brother, he said: "This child is really useless. He has only been a tiny clerk in Shanghai for so many years and can't even support his father." Like a raging flame, my eyes were wet. I didn't dare to say more, so I took the opportunity to sneak into a dark corner to cry.

I never dared to tell my brother about this, lest he be even more sad.

### Prolonging Life

— Shi Dong

A fugitive Viennese scientist recently published a startling report in the United States. In a conversation with the American press, he claimed that he had successfully transplanted one person's head onto another person's body. According to this old professor, from this experiment, he is convinced that science can transplant the important parts of the human body to another person without danger or discomfort, thus giving men and women equal opportunities to prolong their lives!

Extending life is indeed a very interesting question. According to a famous philosopher, life truly begins at forty. He said that entering middle age is naturally unavoidable, but our biggest mistake is that once we cross the threshold of forty, we automatically think that life is already boring.

According to our general concept, middle age begins at forty, and once you pass sixty, you have become old. As for seventy, it is "rare since ancient times." But science is rapidly changing this outdated thinking. In the near future, the average human life expectancy will be set between ninety and one hundred.

Today, scientists who study longevity can be divided into two groups. One group believes that the secret to longevity lies in the vitamins absorbed by the human body. The other group believes that longevity should be attributed to hormones (i.e., the fluid secreted by the endocrine glands).

According to the founder and first chairman of the "Centenarian Club," if humans are willing, they can live to be three hundred years old. However, he added that very few people are willing to live beyond one hundred.

Leaving that aside, the fact is that everyone's life expectancy has already been extended by eight to eleven years in this century. Britain spends £20 million a year to extend the lives of its people. What is the result? In 1881, the average life expectancy for men and women was fifty-seven years. In 1911, the average life expectancy was sixty-two years. In 1931, it increased to sixty-five years. And by 1938, this average life expectancy had risen to sixty-seven years.

### Radio-Controlled Car

— Yong Yun

In the mechanized warfare of various countries, there is already a radio-controlled motorcycle. The picture above was taken during a recent exercise. The motorcycle is equipped with a rifle, and there is a sidecar next to it. The same method has been applied to driving ships and airplanes, and the results have been quite successful.

### Sharing the Same Boat

— He Jia Zhi

(IV) In the Afterglow

In the afterglow, the sunlight shone on the faces of the two people. Guofang looked at Weicheng, who was thin and red-faced. Because he was in mourning, he couldn't get a haircut or shave, and you could faintly see the immature stubble on his skin. Looking at the leather cap pressed on his brow and the collar tightly wrapped around his neck, Guofang couldn't help but feel sorry for him. The way a person dresses differently changes their appearance. Weicheng looked at Guofang, and it was impossible to tell which part of her face was rouge and which part was powder. Everything was rendered like the evening glow in the sky. The evening breeze blew strands of hair and sideburns, naturally rising and falling, and every movement only added to her beauty. This beauty was also the starting point of her intelligence, liveliness, alertness, and other qualities. At this moment, Guofang accidentally bumped into Weicheng's shoulder, and both of them laughed.

Weicheng said, "Are you cold?" Guofang shook her head. Weicheng asked again, "What's wrong with your brother?" Guofang smiled and said, "I seem to have told you several times. There's nothing serious, just a fever." Weicheng said, "I'm sorry, I'm sorry, my memory is so bad." As he spoke, he bent over and took a step back. He stepped on the bank of the field, and with one step back, he stepped into a dry ditch and almost sprained his foot. Guofang saw him suddenly become shorter and quickly grabbed him. Weicheng took advantage of the momentum and stepped back onto the bank, saying, "It's your brother who is causing trouble. You were afraid that I would fall and get a fright." Guofang said, "That's not true. What about you?" Weicheng said, "Neither am I. This is not a park after all. There are no benches or stone piers where you can sit and rest." Guofang said, "You really think I'm a delicate lady who never leaves her boudoir. I'm not that delicate. However, I feel sorry for Sister Cuizhen. She exchanged her hard work for her health. Her hands had cracks like goose webs. I asked her if it hurt, and she said no. I really sympathize with her. I see that everyone in your family has true feelings. Your aunt's love for you can be considered meticulous." Weicheng took her hand and walked east, talking as he walked, saying, "Don't say that. The first person who loved me was my biological mother, but now she has left me. If you say that, it will arouse my..." Guofang quickly changed the subject. (66)
