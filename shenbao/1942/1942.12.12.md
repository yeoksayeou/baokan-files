### Shanghai Needs a Purely People's Organization

Shanghai is a place with extremely complex political relationships. Due to its special and superior conditions in terms of economy and transportation, it has always been the economic, cultural, and even political center of China, and also a battlefield for the great powers to contend for. On the one hand, it is the most prosperous and quintessential city in the country, with a population that once increased to four or five million; on the other hand, it is the darkest and most corrupt place in the country, which those concerned about political issues find heartbreaking. It was not until after December 8th last year, when Japan expelled the special forces of British and American imperialism in Shanghai for a hundred years, that the political relations in Shanghai began to become simpler; and Shanghai has become one of the main battle entities in the Greater East Asia War, and a major link in the practice of "Sino-Japanese cooperation." This is a major epoch-making change in Shanghai. Because of this huge change, every Shanghai citizen is faced with urgent problems to be solved, which are also the immediate concerns of Shanghai citizens, such as food, taxation, economy, finance, education, culture, and so on. In the past, these problems were dictated by the British and Americans, and the citizens had no room for consultation; but now that the British and American forces have been expelled, Japan in the Greater East Asia War will never follow in the footsteps of the British and Americans. Therefore, these problems in Shanghai have begun to require the joint efforts of Shanghai citizens and the Shanghai authorities to solve and deal with. The policies of the authorities must be based on the public will of the people, so that they can fully demonstrate the sincere cooperation of the East Asian nations in the Greater East Asia War, and fully demonstrate the spirit of the Greater East Asia War in helping national self-determination and national liberation. After the January 28th Incident last year, the special shackles of the British and Americans on Shanghai citizens were lifted. After this year's "January 28th," it is hoped that Shanghai citizens will be liberated politically and spiritually. The first thing to do is to give Shanghai citizens the opportunity to express their opinions on issues that are directly related to them.

How can every citizen of Shanghai have the opportunity to express their opinions on all matters that are directly related to them? It is necessary. The people of Shanghai must have their own complete organization. The people's organization that we urgently need must at least have the following characteristics:

First, it should gather impartial people from all walks of life and experts from all fields to serve as leaders of this non-governmental organization, so as to ensure that it is not monopolized by a small number of people.

Second, the members who participate in this non-governmental organization must be impartial people with solid careers or legitimate occupations in Shanghai, and they must voluntarily set aside a certain amount of time to serve this people's organization—that is, to serve the common interests of millions of Shanghai citizens. This non-governmental organization must absolutely not be used by unemployed politicians or hooligans.

Third, such a people's organization should declare its highest goal, which must be to solve all the immediate problems of all citizens and to seek the happiness of all citizens themselves.

Fourth, in order to effectively complete its mission, this people's organization must assist the authorities in promoting various policies that are beneficial to the citizens. And in today's Greater East Asia War, the most important task of this organization is especially

Fifth, to communicate the opinions of the people of China and Japan, promote close cooperation between China and Japan, and strive to avoid all misunderstandings between the two sides. We must know that our future is still arduous, and everyone must prepare for how to deal with an even more difficult environment. This depends not only on the cooperation of the authorities on both sides of China and Japan, but also on the cooperation of the non-governmental organizations on both sides. This depends on a perfect people's organization to shoulder this major responsibility.

The establishment of such a people's organization is urgently needed at present. This is not only for closer cooperation between China and Japan in the Greater East Asia War, but also for the immediate problems of every citizen of Shanghai. For every problem, everyone should not passively hide behind and criticize. We should frankly come forward and sincerely discuss with the authorities to determine a reasonable solution. If impartial people are unwilling to come out, those who falsely borrow the power of the Japanese to swindle and deceive will inevitably control everything, manipulate everything, increase misunderstandings between Chinese and Japanese officials and the people, and at the same time increase the material and spiritual suffering of Shanghai citizens.

At the same time, we hope that the authorities can thoroughly understand the opinions of Shanghai citizens, so that they can more smoothly promote various policies, eliminate the barriers between the people and the authorities, and reduce the obstacles that may be encountered in the implementation of policies. To achieve this goal, we first need Shanghai citizens to automatically organize good groups, so that they can thoroughly understand public opinion in all aspects, obtain the help of public forces in all aspects, and enable various policies to be implemented smoothly, so that Sino-Japanese cooperation can be more practical and thorough.

In order to smoothly solve the current various immediate problems of Shanghai citizens and build a happy new Shanghai in the future; in order to closely cooperate between the authorities and the people and promote the cooperation between China and Japan in the Greater East Asia War, we urgently look forward to the establishment of a purely people's organization in the near future.

Tokyo, 11th (Domei News Agency) - Japanese Prime Minister Tojo, German Chancellor Hitler, and Italian Prime Minister Mussolini exchanged congratulatory telegrams today on the anniversary of the conclusion of the military pact between the three countries, reaffirming their firm determination to defeat the enemy and establish a new world order. In his telegram to Hitler and Mussolini, Prime Minister Tojo congratulated the Axis powers on their glorious victories over the past year and on moving towards the common goal of reconstruction. He also said that he was deeply satisfied to be able to reaffirm to the world that Japan, as a member of the Axis powers, has a greater determination to cooperate closely in order to win the war. The telegram ended with wishes for the health of the two European Axis leaders and expressed his gratitude for the efforts of Germany and Italy in the current war. In his telegram to Prime Minister Tojo, Hitler welcomed the anniversary, saying that it was the anniversary of the three countries becoming the closest armed comrades, proving that the glorious victories of the past year were due to the Axis powers' guarantee of conducting operations to achieve a satisfactory conclusion.

Content of Speeches by the Three Foreign Ministers

Tokyo, 11th (Haitong News Agency) - Japanese Foreign Minister Shigenori Togo said in a radio broadcast in Tokyo today that the victories of Germany, Italy, and Japan in the past twelve months have laid the foundation for a new world order. Japan has always taken the maintenance of peace in the Pacific as its responsibility for many years before the outbreak of the war, hoping to contribute to world peace. However, Japan's efforts were not approved by Britain and the United States, which led to this war. Germany, Italy, and Japan concluded an alliance two years ago with the aim of establishing a new order in East Asia and Europe, and hoping that the leaders of Britain and the United States would recognize this and abandon their plan to dominate the world. However, Britain and the United States were deeply prejudiced and could not be reasoned with, resulting in a world crisis. Today, Germany, Italy, and Japan are fighting side by side to seek the revival of the world. We will defeat the enemy's resistance. I dare say that the people of East Asia and Europe will be completely free from the shackles of Britain and the United States in the near future. From then on, the people of East Asia and Europe will enjoy their free and pleasant life under the strong protection of the countries of the Tripartite Pact, said Shigenori Togo in his speech. At the time when Shigenori Togo delivered his speech, the foreign ministers of Germany and Italy also delivered radio speeches at the same time.

Rome, 11th (Havas News Agency) - Italian Foreign Minister Ciano said in his speech on the anniversary of the Tripartite Pact today that this war is related to the survival of the enemy nations, so the gain or loss of territory is not worth mentioning. Japan's repeated victories over the United States in twelve months are also a source of pride. I dare to pay tribute to the Japanese nation, he said.

### German Troops on the Eastern Front Launch Heroic Mobile Warfare in the Snow, Both Sides Fight for Key Railway Junctions in the Central Region, Soviet Attacks on the Don Bend are Repelled

Lisbon, 10th (Domei News Agency) - The German counter-offensive throughout the Eastern Front is becoming more intense, with strong assaults on Soviet positions everywhere, launching a heroic mobile war in the snow. The Soviets seem to be too busy responding to the attacks to launch counter-offensives again. In particular, the German counter-offensive in the western Erchiv region of the central front is the most intense. The Zhenli Bao reported on the 10th that the German and Soviet armies are currently engaged in a fierce death struggle on the central front. Due to the continuous German counter-offensive, the entire front has become a sea of fire. In addition, the two armies in the western Erchiv region have launched an unprecedented fierce battle for the key railway junction of Samuzi for five days without rest. The Germans began to reinforce their positions with a large number of ski troops and tanks on the morning of the 8th, which is the largest initiative since the winter operations. The white-blade battle in the snow continued on the 9th, and the strategic key point in that area was recaptured on the 10th. At present, they are rapidly pursuing the fleeing Soviet troops. In addition, the Soviet troops in the city of Sicheng have lost their combat power because they cannot use the thin ice of the Volga River to replenish their forces, and only make weak small-scale counter-offensives.

Berlin, 11th (Havas News Agency) - In the Stalingrad and Don Bend areas, large-scale attacks by Soviet troops were repelled before they approached the main German defense line in various places.

Berlin, 10th (Havas News Agency) - According to military sources here, yesterday, the German army launched fierce counter-offensives in various key areas of the front line. The situation in each war zone is described as follows: (1) In the vast semi-circular position of Toropets, the German army began to encircle a large number of Red Army soldiers the day before yesterday, and completed the task yesterday. Only a few Red Army units broke through and abandoned their heavy weapons and equipment on the battlefield. On the vast battlefield, there were remnants of tanks and cars, fragments of artillery tubes, and heavy infantry weapons scattered all over the ground. Ammunition depots that were destroyed, damaged, or on fire were everywhere. (2) In the Erchiv area, the Red Army attacked with the strength of a small unit, but was repelled. The Red Army infantry suffered heavy losses. More than half of the 20 Soviet Zuke vehicles were destroyed. (3) North of Luji City, the Red Army dispatched several teams of powerful armored troops, but each attack was repelled. The German troops in the area took advantage of the enemy's unpreparedness to penetrate deep into the enemy's formation, destroy 60 bunkers, and inflict heavy damage on the enemy. (4) Between the Don River and the Volga River, the German army successfully commanded the operation, successfully blocked the fierce attack of the Red Army tanks, and lost 104 tanks in a narrow area in two days. (5) South of Stalingrad, the German motorized units, in cooperation with the Romanian army, surrounded and annihilated several powerful Red Army units. (6) In western Caucasus, heavy rain poured down, the river flooded, and the war was greatly hindered. The relentless climate made it extremely difficult for the Axis forces to operate. The soldiers have been drenched for several days, and the valleys are flooded with torrents, making it extremely difficult to cross, because military supplies must be transported by horse-drawn carriages. However, the Romanian army still occupied an important mountain peak of the Red Army.

### Axis Forces in Tunisia Occupy the Port of Tabarka, British Troops Assemble on the Libyan Front, Rumor has it that Allied Paratroopers Land in Tunisian Territory

Swiss City, 11th (Havas News Agency) - According to the headquarters of the Allied forces in North Africa, the German offensive power in Tunisia has not weakened so far. The Allied forces are concentrating tank and armored vehicle units in the rear, so as to break through the strong defense lines deployed by the German army around Tunis and Bizerte. At the same time, the German army launched an offensive in the Tabuba area again yesterday. The German air force is even more active, attacking the Tabuba area at night and dropping many bombs and flares.

Lisbon, 10th (Domei News Agency) - It is reported that British and American Allied paratroopers have landed in the southern area of the port of Tunis, destroying railways in several places and approaching a location ten miles from the port of Tunis. However, this news has not been confirmed. According to a broadcast from Moroccian Leitei, the British Eighth Army has mobilized its reserve troops on the 10th and launched an attack on the German and Italian positions near El Agheila. However, the British Central Asian Command only stated in its war report released on the 10th that there were reconnaissance and artillery activities on the front line, and did not mention launching an offensive. According to military experts here, the British army in that area has two tank divisions, an infantry division, and an artillery division, while the Axis forces have strengthened their positions in the Libyan war and the morale of the soldiers is extremely high. No matter what kind of offensive the British and American Allied forces launch, they will undoubtedly be defeated.

### An Overview of Japanese Naval Education

How is the Japanese Navy, which has repeatedly defeated the British and American fleets in the Greater East Asia War, trained? Here is an introduction to the naval education facilities:

School Education and Military Education

Japanese naval education can be divided into military education, which is applied to fleet units, i.e., warships, destroyers, submarine squadrons, torpedo boat squadrons, minesweeper squadrons, naval infantry units, defense units, air squadrons, etc., and school education, which is applied to various naval schools and naval infantry units, etc., especially for students, trainees, supplementary students, recruits, etc. for training purposes. The types of naval education are described as follows:

The central organization of naval education is the Education Bureau of the Ministry of the Navy. The purpose of education is to educate people and the military, and to improve strength through daily training to meet combat requirements.

It is well known that the strength of the navy is not determined by the number of fleets, but by the degree of education and training. Therefore, its education and training are particularly important in realizing the goal of building a strong navy.

Originally, military education can be broadly divided into two aspects: basic education and comprehensive education. Basic education can be further divided into three types: spiritual education, skills education, and physical education. Skills education is further divided into officer education, special warrant officer education (this title is about to be abolished), warrant officer education, and non-commissioned officer and enlisted personnel education; physical education is divided into gymnastics, martial arts, and technical skills. As for comprehensive education, it can be broadly divided into deployment education and combat operations.

Next, let's explain the education of warrant officers and above, and non-commissioned officers and enlisted personnel. Officer education is divided into practical education and academic education. Practical education refers to the acquisition of skills necessary for officers of each department to perform their respective duties; academic education refers to enabling officers to study the academic knowledge necessary for military affairs.

Warrant officer education is provided to selected students from the ranks of warrant officers or non-commissioned officers in the branches of military science, aviation, machinery, accounting, and nursing, enabling them to enter the Naval Academy, the Naval Accounting School, the Naval Supply School, etc., to receive the necessary education.

Non-commissioned officer and enlisted personnel education can be broadly divided into two aspects: deployment education and supplementary education. Deployment education refers to the provision of necessary education for the deployment of each individual; supplementary education refers to enabling them to acquire the general knowledge and skills necessary for each branch and rank. In the naval infantry units, new recruits who have volunteered or have been recruited from conscription receive basic military education. In addition, at various naval schools, naval air squadron training units, naval hospitals, etc., in addition to students, non-commissioned officers receive training as naval special recruits in various branches.

In addition to the above, according to the University Ordinance, each university and specialized school has so-called "Naval Entrusted Students," including naval shipbuilding, machinery, weapons, and other technical students, as well as military medicine and pharmacy students, to train naval technical officers and medical officers. In addition, there are two-year active-duty officers, naval reserve students and trainees, naval aviation reserve students, and naval aviation students, among other educational institutions. That is, the above-mentioned educational system enables various talents to be educated according to their respective talents and suitable places.

School Education

Here is a brief description of the education at each naval school:

1. Naval War College This is the highest naval academy for teaching naval officers advanced academic subjects. Students are divided into four types: regular students, special students, machinery students, and elective students.

2. Naval Academy This is the place for training naval officers in the military branch. In addition to regular students, it also accepts elective students. Elective students are selected from warrant officers and first-class petty officers in the military branch, aviation branch, and maintenance branch.

3. Naval Engineering Academy This is the place for training naval engineering officers. Those who graduate from here, like the military branch officers who graduate from the Naval Academy, will become future officers of the naval forces.

4. Naval Medical School This is the place for military medical and pharmaceutical officers to study the necessary academic subjects. It is also the place for providing nursing branch special warrant officer training to elective students selected from nursing petty officers and first-class nursing petty officers. At this school, all those above the rank of warrant officer are called students, and there are four types of distinctions: advanced course, regular course, elective course, and elective students. The length of study is from half a year to two years.

5. Naval Accounting School This is the place for training naval accounting officers, and also for providing the necessary education to elective students selected from chief accounting petty officers and first-class accounting petty officers. It also provides academic knowledge to those who have become accounting officers and non-commissioned officers and enlisted personnel who will become naval special recruits. The age of admission for students is limited to 16 to 21 years old, and the length of study is four years.

6. Naval Gunnery School This school belongs to the Yokosuka Naval District Commander and is the place for military branch officers, warrant officers, and non-commissioned officers and enlisted personnel who will become gunnery officers in the future to learn gunnery. It also provides general military education to special trainees and naval reserve students, and oversees the physical education of the entire navy.

7. Naval Torpedo School This school is also under the jurisdiction of the Yokosuka Naval District Commander. Like the Naval Gunnery School, it is also a place for naval military branch officers, warrant officers, and non-commissioned officers and enlisted personnel to learn torpedo technology. The distinction between students and trainees at this school is generally the same as at the Gunnery School. Students are divided into three types, and trainees are divided into six types.

8. Naval Communications School This is the place for providing communications education to naval military branch officers, warrant officers, and non-commissioned officers and enlisted personnel.

9. Naval Submarine School This is the place for providing practical training and academic knowledge on submarines to military branch officers, engineering branch officers, warrant officers, and non-commissioned officers and enlisted personnel.

10. Naval Navigation School This is the place for providing navigation, operation, and signaling techniques to military branch officers, warrant officers, and non-commissioned officers and enlisted personnel.

11. Naval Engineering School This is the place for teaching engineering techniques and industrial arts to engineering branch officers, warrant officers, and non-commissioned officers and enlisted personnel.

In addition, there are places where technical education is provided within general education, and there are also naval band education and naval reservist education, etc.

### Authorities in Central and North China Revise Trade Agreement to Promote Balanced Flow of Materials and Determine Exchange Settlement Currency Methods

The relevant authorities in North and Central China discussed trade matters between the two regions in Shanghai on the 7th and 8th of this month. As a result, both parties agreed to revise part of the trade agreement concluded in Beijing in April this year and re-establish a trade agreement. There are three main points of the new agreement: (1) To promote the exchange of materials between the two parties and maintain a balance of payments between the two regions; (2) To stipulate that the special yuan is the currency for exchange settlement, but military scrip and Shanghai exchange can also be used; (3) To divide the trade agreement into two types: trade in specific materials and trade in general materials. The so-called specific materials are coal, pyrite ore, pig iron, alkali powder, etc. from North to South, and wheat flour, sugar, ammonium sulfate, tobacco, gauze, rayon, tea, and tetrapanax papyrifer from South to North. The so-called general materials are glass, peanuts, raw oil, and other agricultural products from North to South, and paper, Chinese medicine, metal products, stationery, soap, leather, groceries, etc. from South to North.

Tianjin Trade is Quite Prosperous

(Commercial News Agency News) Recently, trade between Tianjin and Central China, South China, and the Nanyang region has been quite prosperous, because Central China, South China, and the Nanyang region have a strong demand for various raw materials from North China. Currently, the goods transported from North China to Shanghai are mostly vegetable oil and kerosene. The goods transported from Shanghai to Tianjin are flour and other important necessities. The goods transported from North China to Guangdong include peanut oil, medicinal materials, dried fruits, etc. The vegetables and fresh fruits transported from Tianjin to Shanghai and Guangdong have recently been slightly sluggish. As for the goods transported from Tianjin to Nanyang, they include alcoholic beverages and paper lanterns, etc. The goods transported from Nanyang include rice and various specialty products. Therefore, the barter trade between North China, Central China, South China, and the Nanyang region will become increasingly active after the respective agreements are signed. According to experienced import and export traders, the trade period for North China's goods this year is slightly later than in previous years because the market entry was slightly later. Furthermore, the end of the year is approaching, and banks are about to close their accounts, so financial turnover will inevitably be slightly stagnant. After the end of the year, the Lunar New Year will be approaching, and at that time, North China's foreign trade will inevitably become more active. Among them, the most developed exports will be coal and vegetable oil, and the main imports will be rice and flour.

### Jing'an District Self-Defense Team Members Cancel Night Duty Shifts

Until Midnight

Recently, the weather has become increasingly cold.

Although they want to prepare cold-weather clothing, it is quite expensive, which is very difficult. Therefore, on the 29th of last month, it was resolved by the meeting of the chiefs of each Lianbao and submitted to the district standing committee for ratification. From the 1st of this month, the night service will be temporarily cancelled. As for the normal duty hours, they have been changed to 7:00 AM to 12:00 PM daily.

### Forging Remittance Slips, Investigating the Mastermind, Suspects Released Due to Lack of Involvement

The remittance slips issued by banks in this city are essentially equivalent to promissory notes, and are therefore extremely important in finance. However, these remittance slips are easily forged, and similar incidents have occurred repeatedly. Therefore, for the sake of prudence, the banking industry has issued a notice to its members, requiring that all such documents be signed by two responsible personnel in order to be valid and prevent forgery. Recently, four

men went together to Xiangtai Money Exchange at 511 Sichuan Road, intending to purchase 60,000 yuan of Japanese military scrip. However, the exchange only had 20,000 yuan in stock. One of the four men then presented the exchange with two remittance slips from the Zhejiang Industrial Bank Shanghai Branch, totaling 170,000 yuan in face value. For the sake of prudence, the exchange instructed an employee to take the slips to the Zhejiang Industrial Bank for verification, which revealed that they were forged. They hurried back to the exchange, but three of the four men had already

fled without a trace. Only a Ningbo native named Han Haisheng (an employee of Dingtai Paper Store at 261 Guangxi Road) was apprehended and sent to the Special Court No. 1 for interrogation and detention. Subsequently, suspects Li Fengqi, Wei Chenggang, Xie Kaixia, and Xu Shourong were also apprehended. After investigation by Chinese detectives Lang Zuyin and Liang Gan, it was discovered that the Lu Bao Gambling Den in the South City had also received 6,000 yuan worth of the same type of remittance slips, and the Tongqing Gambling Den had also received one such slip worth 3,000 yuan. However, according to Han's confession, he

was unaware of the matter and was invited by the fugitive Zi Yu and Li Hanzhang (both phonetic). Therefore, when Yuan and the other three fled, he did not flee with them. As for the other four individuals, Li Fengqi, etc., after investigation, they were found to have no connection and were released. As for Han Haisheng, after investigation, he was also found to be innocent and was acquitted. The police are now strictly pursuing the three fugitive masterminds, Yuan, Wu, and Li, to bring them to justice for interrogation.

Heavyweight coarse cloth was generally unchanged. 16-pound Globe still required 256 yuan. The trend of Peach Lady Lin turned flat, hovering around the 300 yuan mark, closing at 300.75 yuan at noon. The market price was 302.5 yuan, and it seemed to have stabilized.

Eastern Cloth: Initially fell and then recovered, ending slightly soft. The new price for 12-pound Dragon Head cloth was 191.5 yuan. The minimum price for bank orders was 189 yuan, but it rose again to 191.25 yuan at noon, down by 1.5 yuan. Rainbow Ball was 192 yuan, Flying Fish was 191.5 yuan, and Yanghe Trumpet remained at 191 yuan, without any honor or disgrace. The starting price for Four Gentlemen Serge Red Orders was 7.59 yuan, plummeting to 7.45 yuan, but at noon, due to absorption by foreign firms, it rose sharply, and the final price was still 7.59 yuan, down by four cents.

### Woolen Fabrics Rise Openly and Covertly

The woolen fabric market is experiencing tight circulation and shortages, and there is a rush to buy, with hoarding and price gouging occurring simultaneously, presenting a situation of open and covert price increases. Winter sales are more advanced than autumn sales, which is not without reason. However, although prices are frequently rising at present, the variety of colors is still incomplete. Palice riding breeches, white serge macao cloth, and light-colored fancy fabrics around 200 yuan per yard are the targets of absorption, and the selling price has risen particularly sharply. Yesterday, Lixing Palice was sold wholesale at 140 yuan per yard, Ewo 元 riding breeches were 270 yuan, grass green was 285 yuan, double-yellow-edged white serge was 200 yuan, and Lianxin and Baoxin macao cloth was 9.6 yuan.

### Miscellaneous Grains Source Not Smooth

Due to transportation difficulties from production areas, the source of miscellaneous grains has not been smooth recently, and market prices remain at a high peak. Yesterday, more than 80 bags of Chongming sand red were opened, priced at 340 yuan to 330 yuan including bags, and 350 yuan for single-thread bags. More than 20 bags of Chongming sand yellow were priced at 300 yuan. Three trucks of Feizi bean cake were priced at 77.25 yuan to 77 yuan, and four trucks of Yuanlong bean cake were priced at 77.5 yuan to 76.75 yuan.

### Sugar Ration Increased

The total amount of sugar to be rationed this month has now been decided to increase to 30,000 bags. The original amount was 25,000 bags. After retailers requested an increase, it was decided to increase the allocation by 5,000 bags. Rumors that the increase was to 35,000 bags are not accurate. White sugar accounts for 74% of the total, green sugar accounts for less than 7%, red sand accounts for 17%, and rock sugar is the least at just over 2%. As for retail sales, each household can still purchase with housing donation tickets, and the amount they can purchase can be increased by 15 yuan compared to before. Prices have not changed.

Longan Meat Sales Prices Are Disordered

The sales prices of longan meat are inconsistent inside and outside the industry, so the market prices are also disordered. According to the latest calculations, there must be losses, so although most people are waiting and watching, it is difficult to reverse the downward trend. The current sales prices are also down by about 100 yuan.

### Arrowroot Starch Tightens Again

Recently, arrowroot starch has become tighter in the market as customers and wholesalers have absorbed it. Yesterday, the Flying Wheel brand traded at over 800 yuan, up 60 yuan. The Flying Unicorn brand on top is approaching the 900 yuan mark, due to dwindling inventory.

### Double Horse Steel Market Trend Hovers

The market trend of 4, 5, and 6-point Double Horse steel and Old Bear steel has remained hovering for several days. Only scattered business from door stores is being seen. The large-volume customers of Hakka gangs and local street factory gangs have not made any moves. Yesterday, the market price for both colors was 800 yuan per box, with little change compared to before. Other hardware products are also experiencing stagnant sales, with transactions but no market.

### Total of Over Two Hundred Banks and Financial Institutions Depositing Reserve Funds

Since November 28, the Shanghai Branch of the Central Reserve Bank has separately notified banks, financial institutions, and trust companies in the city to submit the deposit reserve funds payable on the fixed deposits and special current deposits determined in the monthly report for September of this year to the deposit reserve fund accounts of the respective banks and financial institutions at the Shanghai Branch of the Central Reserve Bank.

### Squeezing to Buy Gold

— Xiang Han

It is said that Shanghai silver shops now only conduct business for two hours each day, and limit customers to buying a maximum of two qian each time. The people buying are extremely crowded, squeezing to buy gold. Someone joked about this before. And now, it is gradually becoming a reality. This is truly a "miracle," a major contradiction in society today.

Mankind's love of gold has a long history. Alchemists spend their lives on alchemy. From commoners to emperors, everyone dreams of gold. One of the most famous stories about the Midas touch tells of an ancient king named Midas who doted on gold. A fairy taught him the secret of the Midas touch, that whatever he touched would turn into gold. The king was overjoyed. Later, the king reached out to hug his only beloved daughter, but she immediately turned into a golden statue. The king was filled with grief and realized the truth. He no longer coveted gold. The fairy then restored his beloved daughter to her original form.

Today, when ordinary wealthy people are squeezing to buy gold, there are few who would not cover their ears and run away upon hearing this ancient story!

Gold was originally the standard currency. Since various countries successively abandoned the gold standard, gold has become something similar to pearls, jade, and diamonds. Now, most of the world's gold is concentrated in the United States, deeply hidden in underground vaults. If we followed Germany's method, gold would be virtually useless, except for decoration.

Those who are squeezing to buy gold generally harbor a complex emotion, hoping on the one hand to have ten thousand taels of gold, and hoping on the other hand that gold is omnipotent. If one day gold really becomes worthless, their frustration will be greater than King Midas's when he saw his beloved daughter turn into a golden statue.

Poor people probably do not have the ability to squeeze to buy gold. Those who squeeze to buy oil and sugar do so for a living. Those who squeeze to buy gold, who knows why!

### "Old-Brand Empress Dowager" Jiang Hong Sick

— Zhi Yu

In this autumn of decline for theatrical talents, Jiang Hong is indeed a unique flower in the barren theater world. "The Palace of Resentment" and "The Butterfly Lovers" saw her unleash her supreme acting skills, winning unanimous praise from the press. This is of course due to talent, but is it not also the harvest of hard work?

In the theatrical world, the actors with talent and a willingness to work hard are Shi Hui for men and Jiang Hong for women. I remember when Huayi staged "The Butterfly Lovers" at the Carlton, inviting Jiang Hong to cross-dress and play Liang Shanbo. She had read the script until she knew it backward and forward a month in advance, and practiced at home.

After "Yun Caixia", Yigu originally intended to restage "The Palace of Solitude", inviting Jiang Hong to play the Empress Dowager Cixi, but the script was rejected and abandoned. At this time, Zhongzhong repeatedly invited Jiang Hong, but Jiang Hong was unwilling to be dependent on others and declined. On the one hand, she and several friends decided to start their own business, preparing for a month, and the China Drama Society was officially announced. Most of the members are young people from famous universities in Shanghai who love theater. In addition, she recruited the most talented drama talents in Shanghai. It is said that Han Fei and others have returned from outside the pass, and may also work for the China Drama Society. The strength of the lineup is unmatched for a time.

China Drama is in contact with the Palace regarding venue issues. The maturation should not be far away. The first performance was originally set to be "Wu Zetian" or Jiang Hong's self-written "Jiangshan Beauty", but who knew that Jiang Hong suddenly fell ill on the afternoon of the 4th. According to the doctor's diagnosis, it was a true diphtheria. After injecting serum, the situation gradually improved. The China Drama Society temporarily decided to stage Lin Yutang's original work, Luo Ming's adaptation of "Moment in Peking", and then stage "Wu Zetian" and "Jiangshan Beauty" after Jiang Hong recovers.

Jiang Hong was originally known as the second Ying Yin. The success of the performance of "Wu Zetian" can be predicted. The writer sincerely wishes her a speedy recovery to health.

### Chinese Dance Drama "The Haunted Temple" to be Staged at the Grand Cathay Theater

Mr. A. S. Loukine, the librarian of the Shanghai Municipal Council Library, has lived in China for more than 30 years and has been studying Chinese music for more than 20 years. He has composed many symphonies based on Chinese melodies and with Chinese flavor, among which the most famous is "North China Hutong". The former Shanghai Municipal Council Orchestra has repeatedly performed it, transmitting the sounds of Chinese sheng, xiao, qin, se, gongs, drums, etc. through Western orchestral instruments one by one, with excellent results. He believes that promoting the modernization and development of ancient Chinese culture should be done with the help of dance because dance does not use words and can help convey the content of music. The dance movements in Chinese Peking Opera and Kunqu Opera are very beautiful and elegant, and cannot be matched by Western "dance dramas". The coordination of music and dance can create Chinese dance dramas. "The Haunted Temple," which will be staged at the Grand Cathay Theater starting on the 17th of this month, is a major attempt to establish Chinese dance drama. The entire play is divided into two acts and is entirely dance and music, with a story, a plot, and beautified scenery and lighting to help its performance. The actors, more than 20 people, are all professional performers invited from major Peking Opera troupes, and they have practiced for three full months before becoming proficient. The music is accompanied by a more than 20-person orchestra.

### Reflections on the Malayan Defeat (2)

— Memoirs of General Percival, Former Commander of the British Army in Malaya

Memoirs of General Percival, Former Commander of the British Army in Malaya

Initial British Deployment

The initial British deployment was decided based on the following three considerations:

(1) The necessity of defending Singapore Island.

(2) The necessity of defending the eastern coast of Johore (because this coast was a suitable location for landing operations).

(3) The necessity of defending airfields (in the northern region, most airfields were located in the Kai Lang Tang and Wellesley regions of Kedah). Based on the above viewpoints, the Malayan Military Administrative Area was roughly divided into the following four districts:

(1) Singapore Fortress Area,

(2) Australian Army,

(3) Indian Third Corps,

(4) "Air Defense."

The Start of the Japanese Attack

Before the start of the Japanese attack, in response to the general international situation, our army's defenses were already perfectly complete. At dusk on December 7th, our aircraft discovered a Japanese convoy cruising 70 miles from the Singora delta. We then completed all defensive preparations. In the Kai Lang Tang area, we were also prepared to be attacked at any time. Regarding the defense of Kai Lang Tang, the purpose of the garrison in that area was to secure the many airfields where our aircraft were located. The aforementioned area seemed too vast for a single garrison to be fully responsible for its defense. However, at the time, we believed we could prevent the Japanese attack, (Note) referring to the heroic "landing under fire" by the forces of Kota Bharu, Iwatomi, etc., and inflict considerable damage on the Japanese army. Later, as the Japanese army advanced step by step, the airfields fell into "unusable" condition due to the fierce bombing of the Japanese air force, and our aircraft fleet had to retreat. Under these circumstances, the Kedah front-line troops received orders on the morning of December 8th to move to the Jitra defense position. In the Singora area, reconnaissance teams were dispatched on the morning of the day when the Japanese landing was confirmed. At the same time, our troops in Kawi Ho were ordered to charge in order to gain favorable positions.

The Retreat from Kai Lang Tang

By December 11th, it was necessary to re-determine the mission of the troops in Kai Lang Tang. Why? It was because the local airfields had become "unusable." On the other hand, the main force of the enemy attacking south to the southwest coast was very fierce. For the sake of defense, it was essential to use all possible troops. Thus, the troops in Kai Lang Tang were ordered to retreat.

The Situation in Kedah

In the last few days of the first week of the war, the situation in Kedah was very dangerous. The Indian 11th Division, which had almost no practical combat experience, began to retreat significantly due to the Japanese advance. Due to "unexpected defeats and confusion, panic," considerable losses were suffered in terms of both manpower and materiel.

### Riding the Storm Together

— He Jia Zhi

11.  Enemy Families

Huang Long said angrily, "Having money and not being able to eat dinner, are you talking nonsense?" Wang the Madman laughed, "I, Wang the Madman, don't talk nonsense. Guests, today is the first day of the New Year. The restaurant staff are busy closing their doors to gamble and have no time to serve guests. The day after tomorrow will still be like this. Where are you going to get money to eat?" Huang Long and Wei Cheng both laughed. Wang the Madman was pleased and said, "Other places don't have blowing rice, but I do here, but I don't have good dishes. I see you: this one isn't a boor; this one is also rough but refined. I'm afraid you won't be used to the dishes in my small shop: dry cuts, random chops, sharp turns, gravy..." Before Wang the Madman could finish his rambling account, Wei Cheng didn't understand the jargon, but Huang Long had already unconsciously started to drool and said, "Such good food, hurry up and bring it out. Wang the Madman is still a madman after all, saying he doesn't have dishes when he has such good food." He sat down and pulled Wei Cheng down too. Wang the Madman then turned around and went out. Huang Long used an index finger and middle finger as a pair of chopsticks, knocked them on the table twice, and sighed, "Boss Wang, don't forget the wine!" Wang the Madman responded from outside.

The wine and dishes arrived. Wei Cheng and Huang Long ate and drank, and although it wasn't the flavor that Huang Long had expected, a hungry man finds any food palatable. They ate and drank until they were drunk and full. Wang the Madman came to accompany them with a smiling face and said, "People say that gambling during the day is just for fun, and we have it here too. It's the New Year, and it's like a theatrical performance at the fair. Even the police officers at the police station, these days, who doesn't seize and grope in their pockets?" Wei Cheng was afraid that Huang Long would hear that there was gambling and be tempted like a mosquito seeing blood, so he quickly cupped his hands to Wang the Madman and said, "Boss Wang, thank you. We still have something to do, so please excuse us for now. If you have something to do, we won't keep you." Wang the Madman stroked his beard and laughed, "Yes, yes, yes, I'll go out. Guests, if you need anything like tea or water, just call out." After Huang Long waited for Wang the Madman to leave, he stood by the window, stretched his neck out, looked up at the dark sky, and turned back to ask Wei Cheng, "We can go now. People in the countryside sleep early. If you're thinking of going, they've probably already fallen asleep." Wei Cheng said, "Let's go, let's go." (240)
