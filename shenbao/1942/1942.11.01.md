### Soviet Troops on the Nedo Line Prepare for Winter Counteroffensive, Fierce Fighting Continues in the Industrial Zone of Stalingrad, German Reinforcements Arrive at the Nalchik Front

Berlin, 31st (Allied News Agency) - The Soviet Union is concentrating troops and munitions on the Eastern Front in preparation for a large-scale winter counteroffensive, aiming to drive the Germans out of the occupied territories. Berlin political circles state that Germany is also prepared for this. Currently, German forces have completely controlled Stalingrad and other areas. Although the Red Army is gathering along the front, German officers will not give them any exploitable opportunity.

Stanford, 30th (Allied News Agency) - According to news from Delhi, Soviet troops stationed in northern Iran are reportedly being transferred to the Caucasus front. Simultaneously, British troops seem to be moving north to occupy the original areas where Soviet troops were stationed.

Stockholm, Swedish Capital, 30th (Havas News Agency) - According to news from Moscow, German infantry, with the assistance of tanks and aircraft, launched another fierce attack on the Red Army in Stalingrad yesterday. Their objective is the industrial zone, attempting to seize important positions. The battles often begin with street fighting and end in hand-to-hand combat. The Red Army is firmly entrenched in every building, resisting resolutely. Although German losses are heavy, they are still gradually advancing, relying on their numerical superiority to break through the Red Army's positions in some areas. Nalchik has also received fresh reinforcements. Meanwhile, according to news from Berlin: (1) A large Red Army detachment is coordinating with the army in the areas of Dopes and Stalingrad. (2) After the Astarakhan-Krasni military supply line was cut off, enemy transportation to and from the front was greatly affected.

Berlin, 31st (Haitong News Agency) - The weather on the Eastern Front improved on Thursday, and battles occurred in many places along the line. If the good weather continues, the battles will become even more intense. The fighting in western Caucasus and the Terek region was relatively quiet. German forces continued to advance towards Natchick. The surrounded Soviet forces under the command of the German army had no way to retreat, as the German forces attacked from the flanks, cutting off all southbound roads. Although the German advance was hindered by a tributary of the Terek River, German engineers are now rushing to build bridges day and night to transport tanks and heavy artillery across the river. German aircraft continued to attack Soviet merchant ships in the Caspian Sea. The Soviet rescue operations in the Stalingrad area have shifted from the northwest of the city to the south. Although Timoshenko has deployed tanks and newly formed infantry divisions to launch attacks, the German positions have not been shaken. The mopping-up operations in the northern factory district of Stalingrad are still ongoing. The Italian army on the Don River front easily repelled the enemy's attack and inflicted heavy losses. Soviet troops concentrated south of Ostashkov, 125 kilometers northwest of Rzhev, and were bombed by German aircraft. The city and port of Murmansk were also attacked by the German air force.

### How to Save China

— Wang Jingwei

Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, we have more deeply and firmly believed that there is only one way to revitalize China and protect East Asia. There is no other way. Moreover, this path already has a reality placed before our eyes. The unreliability of Britain and the United States has long been a great disappointment to the general youth and the general public. It goes without saying. To further prove the historical facts of British and American aggression against East Asia and China, if Britain and the United States unfortunately win, with the South Seas and the Pacific controlled by Britain and the United States, the East Asian continent will have no way to protect itself and will be reduced to a British and American colony. Everyone can easily understand that China can only embark on the unfortunate fate of a second India. As for the Communist Party, after twenty years of continuous agitation, it cannot be said that it has had no influence. However, up to now, the hideous face of the Communist Party has also been exposed. The reversal of the relationship between China and Japan in the East certainly has various reasons. However, why could it not be improved, but instead reversed, and further reversed, leading to this incident? The Communist Party cannot escape its blame. Looking at the situation in the north, Outer Mongolia has already been lost, and Xinjiang in the Northwest has also been communized. If, in recent years, friendly Japan had not assisted Manchuria in establishing an anti-communist camp in the Northeast, it is truly unknown where the communist threat would have ended. In the West, when the European War was about to break out, the Soviet Union, on the one hand, colluded with Britain and the United States to surround Germany, and on the other hand, signed a non-aggression treaty with Germany, doing its utmost to provoke and sow discord. The Soviet Union cannot escape its blame for the outbreak of the European War. From this, it can be seen that today, we can only overthrow Britain and the United States to liberate East Asia and revive China, and only by opposing communism can we ensure East Asian peace and further achieve world peace. Fellow countrymen, the Greater East Asia War cannot fail, nor will it fail. Look, the Soviet Union has failed in Europe, and Britain and the United States have no more bases in the Pacific. We have not only the belief in certain victory, but also the certainty of victory. We will devote all our strength to assist friendly countries and strive for final victory. This victory is determined. It goes without saying. What will happen to China only when the Greater East Asia War is won? This is probably the greatest anxiety in the hearts of our countrymen and young people. Here, we must make decisions with reason. Only by clearly seeing the goal and identifying the direction can we know where to start and advance bravely. This question is too important. As I said just now, whether China can be saved or not depends entirely on this. It must be known that to love China and love East Asia, China and Japan should only be friends and not enemies. These few words are by no means diplomatic rhetoric. They must be understood and deeply believed by everyone, young people and countrymen alike, to be achieved. This is not only a subjective view, but also requires an objective decision. Since the Greater East Asia War, friendly countries have always won their battles and captured their objectives. Now, in the South Seas and other places, the territory they have gained is six times more than the mainland, and the resources they have gained are much richer than China's. For example, rubber is available in the South Seas but not in China. As for oil, rice, and tin, they are insufficient in China but abundant in the South Seas. As for what China has but the South Seas do not, there are only a few types of cotton and manganese. This is just one example. After the occupation of the South Seas, the objective facts are completely different from before the occupation. Thinking for Japan, thinking for China, the problems that could not be solved before have now been solved. There is another level. The so-called resources in the world are nothing more than two types: material resources and human resources. And human resources are even more important than material resources. Without human resources, there is no way to produce material resources. Why did Britain fail? Because the British imperialists only cared about material resources and did not care about human resources. They did not know that the most important thing in the world is people, is people's hearts. Although they obtained materials, without people and losing people's hearts, they were of no use. Britain's failure lies in this. Friendly Japan clearly sees that human resources are more important than material resources, so it wants the hearts of the people of Greater East Asia to be united, and it wants the countries of East Asia to unite, to share the same mind and the same virtue, to coexist and co-prosper. This is not just a subjective expectation, but also an objective requirement. Besides this, there is no other way. Therefore, today, all those who live in East Asia, whether they are advanced countries or backward countries, can only walk together on this road. Facts have proved that the road in Chongqing is a dead end. Only peace, anti-communism, and nation-building are the great roads to revitalize China and protect East Asia. We must devote all our spirit and strength to promote comprehensive peace on this road. We must also devote all our spirit and strength to cooperate with the Greater East Asia War on this road. This road is not something that can be casually and luckily achieved. It must be known that the more effort there is, the more harvest there will be. Sharing joys and sorrows is not just empty talk. We must be sure of the future joys, and we must also shoulder the present sorrows. Some people are too fortunate, thinking that they can enjoy the happiness of peace in the peaceful areas. Fellow countrymen, this is not the time to enjoy happiness. This is the time for us to risk our own lives to save the country from a life-or-death situation. We can only endure hardship, shoulder responsibilities, and put in more effort, which will also save more vitality for the country and extend more life for the nation. We must contribute capital for China and also contribute capital for East Asia. The so-called capital is that we mobilize the hearts of the four hundred million undead people spiritually and mobilize all the power materially to complete the new mission of this new era. Fellow countrymen, although we cannot often meet each other, our hearts are the same. It goes without saying that our hearts cannot be separated, and even our hairs cannot be separated. We are united as one to shoulder the responsibility of peace, anti-communism, and nation-building, to revitalize China and protect East Asia.

Today, we have no other words, but to wish our countrymen, with all our enthusiasm, to have heart-to-heart, sincere unity, hard work and endurance, brave and vigorous progress, and not to be like me, who, at this age of sixty, remembers the determination of thirty-three years ago, which has not yet been completed. I earnestly hope that all countrymen will take out the strength in their hearts and the strength in their bodies to save China and save East Asia. They will save them back in your own hands. (End)

### Africa in the Changing Situation

Foreword

As cold and heat alternate with the seasons, and time inevitably moves forward, so too do battlefields change, albeit with some uncertainty. Looking at the overall world situation, Africa, this "primitive continent," is currently in a state of flux.

The Shifting Battlefield

As of May 8th of this year, the German army launched a so-called summer offensive on the Kerch Peninsula. At that time, they were truly "unstoppable," successively occupying key towns such as Sevastopol, Melitopol, Voroshilovgrad, Voronezh, and Rostov. They then divided their forces into three routes, crossed the Don River, and directly attacked Stalingrad, reaching the outer perimeter of the city by mid-August. To support the Eastern Front, Hitler simultaneously launched a North African offensive in early June, driving back the British Eighth Army, which had invaded Libya. They advanced all the way, recapturing Tobruk on June 20th, and invading Egypt on June 23rd. After passing through Sollum and Sidi Barrani, they captured Mersa Matruh, 130 miles deep into Egypt, on June 30th. They then advanced southeast, occupying El Alamein on July 9th. At that time, the British Eighth Army was almost irrecoverably defeated, and its commander, Ritchie, was dismissed. Fortunately, General Auchinleck, the commander of the Middle East forces, rallied the remaining troops and turned the tide, and the Egyptian battle situation finally stabilized by the end of July, and Alexandria, which had seemed about to fall, was saved.

Hitler's plan for North Africa was to pass through Egypt and coordinate with the German forces descending from the Caucasus, with the aim of seizing the rich oil fields of the Caucasus and the Near East, and cutting off Britain's lines of communication between Europe and Asia. However, this plan was thwarted both by the stalemate in the Egyptian campaign and by the treacherous terrain of the Caucasus, which made him feel that he must first conquer Stalingrad in the Volga River valley before he could advance south. However, the Battle of Stalingrad lasted for two and a half months, and even though eight or nine tenths of the city have now been occupied, the fact is that it is now late autumn. Not only is there snow and ice in the Caucasus Mountains, but the Volga River will soon freeze over. In this respect, both sides, having fought fiercely for several months, seem to be exhausted and have no reason to continue fighting this winter. At least, after the German army captures Stalingrad and achieves a partial victory, they will have the opportunity to hold their occupied areas and spend the winter. Therefore, most people speculate that the battlefield will gradually shift from the Eastern Front to other places more suitable for combat, just as the seasons change, and most believe that Africa is the most likely battlefield in the future.

The Importance of Africa

Africa is the most "innocent" land in the world. Everyone's impression of it is nothing more than deserts, palm trees, pyramids, curly-haired, thick-lipped, ignorant black people, and bizarre poisonous snakes and wild beasts. It is what people often call the "primitive continent" and the "colonial continent." Since the beginning of history, it has only known how to be slaughtered and oppressed, and has never oppressed anyone. Despite this, war is still inevitable on its head. This is a tragedy of mankind, but perhaps this is the law of "evolution."

Africa has a total area of approximately 30 million square kilometers, but its population is only one-third of China's, approximately 140 million people, with an average of only five people per square kilometer. This is far less than Asia's 23 people per square kilometer and Europe's 47 people per square kilometer. However, because the land is not suitable for production, the climate is hot and harsh, and there are more deserts in the interior, culture and economy are very backward. Since the Berlin Conference in 1885, it has simply become the target of European powers to be divided.

However, since the last European war, the economic, political, and even military importance of Africa has gradually been noticed. For example, in terms of production, Egypt's cotton, South Africa's gold mines and diamonds, Sudan's gums, Rhodesia's chromium, the Gold Coast's manganese, and the coconuts, coffee, ivory, ostrich feathers, etc. produced in various places are indeed worthy of the envy of countries lacking raw materials. In political terms, Germany's former territories, which were deprived by the Treaty of Versailles, were certainly unwilling, and Italy has always believed that Britain and France cheated it after the end of the last European war, so it has long called for a redistribution of colonies. Even the outbreak of this war, the competition for colonies is one of the reasons. From a military point of view, the current war being waged by both sides is not only a total war in terms of resources, but also a global war in terms of the front line. Africa is connected to both Europe and Asia, and the closest point to South America is only 2,500 kilometers away. Both the Axis powers and the Allied powers now need to seize strongholds in Africa in order to cut off the other side's supply of raw materials, attack the other side's lines of communication, and thereby increase their own strength. Moreover, Britain and the United States are shouting for the opening of a second battlefield, and after the Eastern Front enters the winter phase, Germany and Italy also need to harass the Allied powers in other areas. Therefore, from any point of view, Africa has the possibility of being gradually used as a battlefield by both sides.

Recent Developments

The above is a discussion of the importance of Africa in terms of the situation. In fact, recent developments related to Africa in the past ten days are indeed worthy of attention.

First, the Egyptian front, which had been silent for more than two months, suddenly launched an offensive on October 24th by the British Eighth Army (now under the command of General Alexander, who had previously commanded the war in Burma), claiming to counterattack El Alamein with ten divisions. The British army also attempted to land east of Tobruk and Mersa Matruh, while the British Air Force repeatedly bombed the port of Genoa in southern Italy, allegedly to prevent General Rommel from obtaining reinforcements and military equipment from Europe. One day, British aircraft even bombed Crete.

Second, the British military operations against French Madagascar are still progressing steadily. Although this island is called an island, its area is actually larger than the territory of France itself. The United Kingdom is willing to offend its former allies and is determined to occupy this large island that straddles the route from South Africa to the Middle East, which is certainly for a special purpose and is by no means comparable to ordinary matters.

Third, today, when the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union are arguing endlessly about the second battlefield, South African Prime Minister Smuts (a famous general from the last European war) is boldly declaring in London that he will take the offensive and is also preparing to go to the United States. At this moment, American troops landed in Liberia, the only independent country in West Africa, and there are rumors that this small country will sever diplomatic relations with the Axis powers. Coincidentally, Admiral Darlan, the commander-in-chief of the French Navy and Air Force, is also inspecting the French West African port of Dakar, which is the most problematic port—only 2,000 miles from Pernambuco, Brazil. After his inspection, he made a statement, stating that "Dakar will resist fully if it is invaded," and French Navy Minister Auphan also visited Toulon, where the country's entire fleet is located.

Introducing the Full Picture of Africa

In view of the above, the "African War" is indeed gradually becoming an important scene on the world stage. In order to facilitate readers' reference, this newspaper has decided to introduce the full picture of Africa in installments, forming a systematic album. The general classification is: (1) Independent countries, (2) French territories, (3) British territories, (4) Italian territories, (5) Territories of Spain, Portugal, and Belgium. There are only two articles on independent countries, Egypt and Liberia. The territories of various countries are divided into four types: self-governing dominions, directly administered colonies, protectorates, and trust territories. Each article forms a system on its own, with one or several places as the topic. They can be read separately or together. From politics and economy to customs and human feelings, the principle is to provide objective introductions and interesting descriptions. We hope that readers will pay attention to them.

Mr. Inagaki To, the Chief Controller of the Shanghai Municipal Council's Goods Control Office, made a special statement to our reporter yesterday, saying, "The Bureau is currently setting up a 'Public Association Section' under the Goods Control Office, with the aim of establishing close contacts with various industry associations in terms of price control and goods distribution, so that the opinions of various industry associations can be conveyed to the top, and the Bureau's opinions can also be clearly announced, in order to avoid misunderstandings. On the one hand, if merchants encounter any difficulties in their business and make reasonable requests, the Public Association Section is prepared to accept them. Various industry associations must register with the Fuzhou Road Police Department Office No. 607 before November 30th. Any industry association that is not licensed by the Bureau will not be allowed to establish itself."

The Meaning of Controlling Prices Lies in Appropriateness and Reasonableness.

Chief Controller Inagaki continued to analyze the current situation and the relationship between it and price control, saying, "The citizens do not know the main significance of the Bureau's implementation of price control. In the future, the Bureau will continue to adopt a low-price policy, and we hope that all citizens will thoroughly understand it and assist in it. Since December 8th of last year, the situation in Shanghai has been very different from the past. In the past, the determination of the price index was entirely based on free trade, but now it must be based on a controlled economy. In other words, in the past, the standard of prices depended on the overall supply and demand of the world, but now it is only influenced by the supply and demand of materials in East Asia. Generally speaking, when materials are abundant, prices are low, and when materials are scarce, prices are high. Price control is not determined by the degree to which prices are lowered, but by setting appropriate and reasonable prices."

Promote Automatic Price Reduction and Hope for Restrained Consumption

For the past year, most of the residents, especially the Chinese, have lived frugally on weekdays, but another group of people have indulged in extravagant lifestyles. If these people can reduce their standard of living and reduce the consumption of major items, it will naturally benefit the public. In order to stabilize people's livelihoods, the authorities will strive to implement a low-price policy. On the merchant side, they should try to suppress prices as much as possible. On the general public side, they must strive to restrain consumption. As for how to specifically implement the low-price policy, I (Inagaki) believe that this cannot be achieved by legal force alone. In addition to using the law, we should promote the merchants' automatic awakening and the people's sincere cooperation. Therefore, the Bureau has now specially established the Public Association Section to establish close contacts with various industry associations, so that the opinions of the Bureau and the associations can be clearly understood by each other, so that misunderstandings can be eliminated and difficulties can be avoided. When things happen, they can be smoothly promoted, and they will inevitably achieve twice the result with half the effort, and the merchants' automatic price reduction can also be gradually realized.

Complete This Project With the Cooperation of Officials, Merchants, and the People.

Mr. Inagaki finally stated, "In the future, controlling prices will depend on the efforts and cooperation of the various industry associations and the responsible personnel of the Bureau's Public Association Section. Stores that have already joined the association are requested to cooperate with all their strength. Stores that have not joined the association should join as soon as possible, because joining the association is closely related to the distribution of materials in the future. If any stores are waiting and watching and attempt to operate freely without joining the association, the authorities will severely punish them. Furthermore, hoarding and speculating in the black market are clearly enemies of the public, and the authorities will also severely punish them. We sincerely hope that all citizens will sincerely cooperate with the authorities to achieve the above objectives. That would be fortunate indeed."

### The Greater Asia Federation to be Established in Mid-Month

A dispatch from the Domei News Agency in Shanghai states that the Shanghai Greater Asia Federation will be established on November 15th. This is based on the report of the preparatory meeting of the Federation yesterday. The purpose of the Federation is to promote cooperation between the Chinese and Japanese people and to nurture Asian culture.

### The Public Association is Allowed to Resume Business

According to Domei News Agency, the relevant authorities, in view of the current state of Shanghai's economy, which has gradually returned to normal, have decided to place the Public Association (Foreign Stock Exchange) under military control and allow it to resume business. The authorities of the Asia Development Board made a statement on this on the 31st, saying that after the Japanese army entered the concession in Shanghai, in order to prevent the economic world from shaking, various exchanges were closed. After detailed investigation of the recent economic situation and consideration of the position of the Shanghai financial market, it was decided to first place the Public Association, which had been closed by the Japanese army, under military control and allow it to resume business. The Asia Development Board, entrusted by the Japanese army, has decided to implement strict supervision and allow the Public Association to conduct specific transactions such as Chinese stock and central and local public bonds as its main business. However, under the current situation, it is still necessary to adopt strict control over the Public Association, and it is also intended to fully adopt strict measures to suppress speculative transactions. Concrete measures for the opening of the Public Association are expected to be decided soon, and the traders of the Public Association will be recruited from powerful brokers in the city. At the same time, a strict crackdown policy will be adopted against illegal operations similar to stock exchanges for many years.

### If the Situation Requires it, Rationed Sugar Distribution Will be Implemented. Retail Store Clerks are Lazy in Responding.

The sugar situation in the city has shown signs of worsening again. Well-informed sources expressed their opinion that the only effective way to quickly improve the sugar situation is for the municipal authorities to control the distribution of sugar. If necessary, sugar ration tickets will be issued to residents. Although the Shanghai Sugar Merchants Cooperative Business Office has made various efforts, it has not formulated a smooth distribution plan, resulting in long queues of sugar buyers in front of Nanhua stores throughout the city. This situation is similar to the rice and bread crisis encountered by residents before the implementation of grain rationing.

Inspections to be Implemented From Today

Over the past two weeks, hoarding and speculation of sugar have been quite obvious. The Shanghai Sugar Merchants Cooperative Business Office announced the other day that in order to restore the normal state of the sugar situation, it will conduct periodic inspections of retail businesses that receive more than 30 bags of sugar per month from today, in order to supervise the retail business of sugar and prohibit hoarding and speculation. It is reported that shops that receive more than 30 bags of sugar per month must sell one-thirtieth of their allocated amount on a daily basis, and the remainder must also report their daily sales. Anyone found to be hoarding and speculating will no longer be allocated sugar. The Shanghai Sugar Merchants Cooperative Business Office has discovered that the sugar shortage is caused by shop owners' manipulation, so it has decided to control sugar retail.

### Nanhua Store Owner Arrested for Monopolizing Sugar

The French police recently inspected the inventory of various sugar merchants in order to investigate retail prices and prohibit monopolies. It was found that Lu Zhiwei, the owner of Yuchangtai Nanhua Store at No. 46 Ximen Road, had a large amount of sugar in stock, but refused to sell it to customers at the limited price of 4.3 yuan per catty, and privately sold it to others at a price of 8 yuan per catty using a balance. After investigation, Lu heard the news and fled, but was eventually arrested the next day.

### The Central Trust Bureau to Issue Deposits on Schedule

According to Domei News Agency, the Central Trust Bureau has been ordered by the Japanese military authorities to liquidate since September 14th. It has now been decided to start the first issuance of deposits in accordance with the following items: (1) The first issuance of deposits is 1,000 yuan per household, but the funds paid by the industry from December 9th, 1941 to September 13th, 1942 are all included; (2) For households with deposits of 5,000 yuan or more, the issuance must be noted that they are not hostile before payment can be made; (3) Address for issuing deposits: Central Trust Bureau Shanghai Branch, 2nd Floor, 592 Fuxu Road; (4) Starting date for issuing deposits: November 4th, from 10:00 am to noon; (5) The second issuance of deposits will be announced separately.

### Electricity Consumption Restrictions to be Implemented in the French Concession from Today. Special Difficulties in Obtaining Raw Materials.

Consular Decree No. 346 of the French Consulate in Shanghai: In order to carry out the order, the Consulate hereby promulgates the following articles in accordance with Articles 9, 10, and 13 of the Organization Charter of the Shanghai French Concession Board of Directors of January 15, 1927, Consular Decree No. 347 of September 26, 1941, Consular Decree No. 453 of December 9, 1941, the Board of Directors' notice, and the report of the General Manager of the Shanghai French Water and Electricity Company regarding the unexpected and special difficulties in obtaining raw materials.

Massive Consumption is Prohibited

(Article 1) From November 1, 1942, electricity consumption shall be subject to the following restrictions: (Article 2) Except for industrial use, bakeries, medical equipment, and electric stoves for heating, the use of electricity for electric heating is prohibited. (Article 3) Electricity consumption for electric lights (households, shops, warehouses, factories, etc.), motive power (regardless of type), and permitted electric heating shall be limited to 100% of the monthly standard consumption calculated in accordance with Article 4 below. In addition to the general rules applicable to this decree, advertising and decorative equipment, such as advertising signs and shop signs that consume a large amount of electricity, lanterns, and strong spotlights, are prohibited.

Method for Calculating Electricity Consumption

(Article 4) For users whose electricity consumption has exceeded 400 kilowatt-hours (i.e., 4,000 watt-hours) in one or more months since January 1942, the standard amount of new electricity use (i.e., the old standard amount used to replace Consular Decree No. 347 of September 26, 1941) shall be calculated as follows:

(1) For formal electricity equipment that existed before February 1, 1942, the standard electricity consumption shall be the monthly average of the three months with the highest electricity consumption from January to September 1942. However, if this consumption exceeds 80% of the previously applied monthly standard consumption, it shall be reduced to 80% of the previous standard consumption.

(2) For electricity equipment that has formally started or changed since February 1, 1942, the standard electricity consumption shall be determined jointly by the Board of Directors and the Water and Electricity Company.

(Article 5) Regardless of the type of user, if the monthly electricity consumption exceeds 400 kilowatt-hours (i.e., 4,000 watt-hours), or if the consumption is above 400 kilowatts (i.e., 4,000 watt-hours) and exceeds the amount permitted in Article 4 above, an additional surcharge shall be paid for the excess portion. The calculation method is as follows:

For the portion exceeding the quota by 10%, pay five times the full amount at the current price.

For the portion exceeding the quota by 11% to 20%, pay ten times the full amount at the current price.

For the portion exceeding the quota by more than 20%, pay 20 times the full amount at the current price.

(Article 6) The surcharges obtained in accordance with Article 5 shall be credited to a special reserve fund for the benefit of consumers and shall be handled in accordance with a consular decree to be announced for this purpose in the future.

Reduction in Power Supply by Percentage Exceeding Limit

(Article 7) For users who use motive power and whose normal electricity exceeds 50 kilowatts, in addition to being subject to the restrictions listed above, they may reduce 90% of the electricity they rent, but the remaining usable electricity, in any case, cannot be lower than 50 kilowatts. This reduction restriction applies during the period from 17:00 to 22:00 every day from November to March (this time refers to the time in Shanghai on November 1, 1942. If the time is changed, it shall be calculated according to the corresponding time).

Temporary Suspension of Supply for Violations

(Article 8) If a user does not comply with the above rules, in addition to being punished in accordance with the provisions of Article 5, they shall be notified to comply with the provisions of this decree. If they still ignore it, the electricity supply to the user may be suspended for a certain period of time after considering the opinions of the Board of Directors and the Water and Electricity Company. (Article 9) The supply of electricity required for new equipment or the expansion of existing equipment shall be refused. However, this shall not apply to the electricity necessary for private water intake equipment, elevators, and household water tanks for newly built or future residential buildings, as well as the lighting required for such residential buildings. (Article 10) The above provisions may be varied in the event of public order, after considering the opinions of the Board of Directors or the Police Department and the Water and Electricity Company. (Article 11) Consular Decrees Nos. 247 and 465 of September 26, 1941 and December 9 of the same year, which were promulgated regarding the restriction of electricity, are repealed. (Article 12) The Director-General of the Board of Directors and the Chief Superintendent of the Police Department shall each enforce this decree within the scope of their respective powers. October 30, 1942, French Consul General Magerey.

### Unprecedented Changes in the Bond Market: All Bonds Plunge by Four Yuan, Hitting the Limit Down

The gray market for public bonds suddenly underwent unprecedented changes yesterday. People were agitated and rumors spread. This was due to the announcements in various newspapers that the authorities would crack down on speculation in public bonds and study effective countermeasures. After the market opened, there were only sellers in the market. The opening price for Type C bonds immediately saw 58.5 yuan, only four cents away from the limit down price. Initially, there were still short-covering and those buying low, but seeing the low, they actually rebounded by more than one yuan. Afterwards, the selling pressure increased. As the market was about to close, the market was filled with selling voices, and finally all bonds were announced to have hit the limit down. This kind of extreme change was like a bolt from the blue. At the close, there were still sell orders at a slightly lower price of two yuan. Although this unexpected change seemed sudden, there was actually news beforehand, but it was not noticed by the general public. Yesterday, there were still many people holding a large number of goods, unaware of the underlying situation. After it becomes widespread, the changes may be more than this. As a result, the market price uniformly fell by four yuan, hitting the limit down. The total transaction volume was about four million yuan or more. A brief table is listed below:

### Business Office Sends Personnel to Supervise Sugar Retail Sales

For the 96 retailers allocated more than 30 bags of sugar, each will have one sales supervisor stationed. For the hundreds of others allocated between 15 and 30 bags, and the more than 200 allocated less than 15 bags, inspectors will be dispatched to check sales accounts at any time, in order to prevent the occurrence of black markets and eliminate malpractices. Starting today, Type A retailers are limited to selling five yuan worth of sugar per person. Sales will be widespread throughout the city, and there must be no shortage of weight or adulteration with impurities. Otherwise, once discovered, in addition to severe punishment, the right to allocation will be permanently lost.

### Decorative Gold Meanders and Declines

Yesterday, in the city's silver and money industry, the jewelry gold market of Daxin peer's storefront did not change its listed exchange price of 2,550 yuan per tael (buying in reduced by about 300 yuan). The price for inter-industry transactions meandered and declined, and the price has retreated to within 1,300 yuan. This is because the price of the United Reserve Note has retreated to around 4.8 yuan. People's hearts are softening, and the morning inherited the upward momentum of the previous day, initially at 1,340 yuan, an increase of 25 yuan, but under selling pressure, it gradually fell by a small amount of 40 yuan, falling to 2,300 yuan. The price for limit-selling households was raised to 2,320 yuan. At noon, it fell again, and at noon it was 2,290 yuan for fewer buyers, a decrease of 25 yuan compared to the previous day, with a difference of 50 yuan. Transactions were sparse. The listed price of jewelry pure silver was still 14 yuan per tael. The price for inter-industry transactions was 12.3 to 7 yuan for buying and selling. The market sentiment was firm.

### Doing Everything Yourself

— Hua

In general households, it is easy to hear complaints about dissatisfaction with maids because the maids' every move ultimately fails to meet the expectations of the mistress.

In fact, on careful thought, maids are all without knowledge; they definitely do not have new ideas or the ability to do things, how can they compare to a mistress? Therefore, even if a large group of maids are employed in the home, the mistress will still not feel satisfied.

Franklin once had a saying: "If you want a faithful and beloved servant, please serve yourself." This is what we Chinese call "doing everything yourself."

In fact, many things in the household do not need to be entrusted to maids. In the morning, the mistress can personally go to the vegetable market to buy groceries, then she can choose fresh and inexpensive dishes, and second, she can avoid the maids from profiting from them. Taking care of the children can be done by oneself, first, it can allow the children to receive attentive care, and second, it can avoid the maids from instilling bad habits or language. Cooking can also be done by oneself, first, it can ensure that the saltiness is appropriate, and second, it can also avoid excessive consumption of oil and soy sauce. In this way, it not only conforms to the principle of diligence and thrift in managing the household, but it can also be said to be an appropriate action for the current era.

### Preventing Colds

— Yi

Most people think that a cold is a very minor discomfort, just a small irritation, but even a very mild cold can turn into a serious illness, so preventing colds is no less important than preventing other serious infectious diseases.

The turn of autumn and winter can be said to be the most popular season for colds. The weather suddenly turns cold, and clothing is thin, making it easy to contract a cold. Therefore, general knowledge about colds is essential.

Colds can be divided into two types: infectious and non-infectious. Non-infectious colds are caused by the countless bacteria that originally reside in the oral cavity. Once they cross their boundaries and invade the mucous membranes, infectious colds are caused by the spread of bacteria. However, even if a person's cold is not due to infection, he can transmit it to others, so people with colds should avoid putting their hands near their mouths, and when eating and needing to use their hands, they should first wash their hands clean.

In colds that are not due to infection, since they originate in the oral mucosa, it is important to avoid exposing the oral mucosa to irritation. Excessive smoking and breathing through the mouth can both cause irritation to the mucous membranes.

Fatigue can also cause colds, so rest on time and get enough sleep. People with easily irritated nerves are prone to catching colds, so a calm and peaceful mind is also a good way to prevent colds.

Sudden changes in temperature are the most likely cause of colds. In a very warm room, suddenly a gust of wind blows in, which can cause people with weaker bodies to catch a cold, because the temperature of the human body is constantly adjusted throughout the body, and occasionally a special change occurs in a certain part, which will cause the cold air to enter.

Usually breathing more fresh air can also enhance the body's resistance.

When there are already signs of a cold, it is important not to delay. Wash your feet with hot water, soak them for 20 to 30 minutes, and then go to bed and sleep soundly, covering yourself with a thicker quilt to make your body sweat. If you have a high fever, you should consult a doctor.

Because the nasal passages are often blocked during a cold, most people have to forcefully remove the nasal mucus, which should be noted to avoid causing damage to the ears.

Keeping the body warm, avoiding fatigue or nervous tension, and bringing the body to a healthy state are effective ways to prevent colds.

### Breastfeeding Tips

— Zhu Ying

Milk is the property stored for the child.

How should breastfeeding be done to fulfill the responsibility?

Children are the future masters of the country and will bear the great responsibilities of the country in the future. If their spirit is insufficient and their physical strength is inadequate, even if other conditions are met, they may not be able to shoulder great tasks and become capable citizens in the future. However, seven or eight out of ten Chinese people are unhealthy. This is entirely because they did not receive good nurturing as infants. Later, even if they try to recuperate after growing up, they may not be able to turn weakness into strength. From this, it can be seen that whether the body is strong or weak depends on the nurturing during infancy and whether the breastfeeding method is appropriate as a prerequisite.

1.  Breastfeeding: Newborns need good nutrition, and breast milk is the most suitable. Breast milk feeding is the standard method of artificial nutrition. Breast milk contains substances that guide the excretion of fetal stools, and its components are consistent with the digestive capacity of newborns, and its amount is consistent with the stomach contents of newborns.

Breast milk nutrition is not only beneficial to infants, but also has great benefits to the mother's body. A famous French medical Dr. Pilleda said: "If you want to be a perfect mother, then you must fulfill the responsibility of breastfeeding, because your milk is the property stored for your child, not your own, you must return it to your child." These words are strongly opposed by many crying women. Some say that mothers with weak bodies should not fulfill the responsibility of breastfeeding, and some say that breastfeeding is harmful to the mother's health and beauty, so they must use a wet nurse to breastfeed.

In fact, there are many benefits for mothers to breastfeed themselves, which may be briefly described below:

(A) The mother's own breastfeeding can enhance the contraction of the uterus due to the stimulation of the child's sucking action, which is the best way to prevent postpartum bleeding, and at the same time allows the mother's lower abdominal organs to return to normal early.

(B) When the mother breastfeeds herself, she can prevent premature second conception. Women who do not breastfeed often produce too densely, which can easily lead to physical aging.

(C) The mother's own breastfeeding can make the skin delicate, the face radiant, the eyes sharp, the hair lush and shiny, and it can also prevent obesity. It is a big mistake to think that breastfeeding is harmful to the mother's body.

(D) The benefits that children receive in terms of body and spirit from the mother's close care are naturally different from those who are cared for by others.

(E) Breast milk nutrition has various advantages over animal milk (cow's milk, goat's milk): (1) The composition and properties of each component of animal milk are different from those of human milk, but no matter what, human milk is suitable for the development of the child's body, (2) Human milk is easier to digest and absorb in the body than animal milk, (3) Breast milk is directly transported from the breast to the child's body, without the risk of spoilage or mixing with pathogens, which is not the case with animal milk, (4) According to facts and statistics, breastfed children develop faster, have fewer illnesses, and have a very low mortality rate compared to artificially fed children.

Therefore, it is said that mothers must fulfill the responsibility of breastfeeding and cannot give food indiscriminately, even breastfeeding more than ten times a day, and in addition to mother feeding, they also hire wet nurses to feed, and even add milk powder, and even feed rice flour and rice to infants who have not been born for several months, and there is no fixed time for feeding. It should be known that whether the quality is inappropriate or the quantity is too much or too little can cause nutritional disorders in infants.

Infants do not need to be breastfed within twelve hours after birth, but they need to be fed water every two hours. After twelve hours, they should be breastfed every four hours. The breastfeeding times are 6:00 AM, 10:00 AM, 2:00 PM, 6:00 PM, 10:00 PM, and 2:00 AM; the watering times are 8:00 AM, 12:00 PM, 4:00 PM, and 8:00 PM. Initially, although the mother's milk is not secreted much, it should still be breastfed on time to develop the newborn's habit of sucking milk, and it can also promote lactation. During the period between two breastfeedings during the day, a sterilized and clean baby bottle should be used to feed about 30 cc of warm boiled water, which not only provides water, but also develops the habit of using a baby bottle, so that in case the mother is occasionally short of milk or other circumstances, there is no need to worry about not being used to feeding the bottle. The usual breastfeeding time should not exceed fifteen minutes. (To be continued)

### Scrap Fabric Grid

— Yin

If you are willing to take advantage of your spare time to carefully sort out and plan all your scraps of fabric, then you will soon be able to make a most interesting quilt cover or bedspread.

When you sort out the scraps of fabric, you can immediately see how much yellow cloth there is, how much red cloth there is, how much green cloth there is, how much cloth with broken flowers there is…

If you plan to sew the scraps of cloth with thread to make a goose, then you can cut the white cloth into the goose's body, the yellow cloth into its head and beak, the red cloth into its feet, and then use the green cloth and cloth with patterns as its background. Sew these pieces together piece by piece with thread to make a composite of about one foot two inches square.

Patiently sew several more of these pieces using the above method, until you calculate that you have enough to piece together a quilt cover or bedspread.

When piecing together the quilt cover or bedspread, you can buy a few feet of light blue fine cloth, cut it into the same size as the above composite, and then sew them together with thread - that is to say, each piece of cloth with a goose shape is joined together with a piece of light blue cloth, and so on alternately, to make a large bedspread or quilt cover.

Of course, if it is a bedspread, after piecing together the text, you can also add a wide border of light yellow around the edges to make it more beautiful.

As for the goose pattern, it is not necessary to make it look realistic. Just make it symbolic.

### Twelve Letters from the Grell Family

— Translated by Xu Baiyi

Mr. Grell Heinrich's son, since being promoted to ledger clerk, his romance has also begun. He sold fifty-two dollars' worth of roses and charged them to his father's account, which Mr. Grell Heinrich naturally considered the most inappropriate measure. Filled with life experience, Mr. Grell Heinrich became afraid of his son's blindly pursuing marriage, so he immediately wrote a letter to faithfully advise him, hoping that he would not make a lifelong mistake.

Letter Nine: A Lifelong Matter

Dear Son:

When I opened the attached letter, I immediately knew that I had opened the wrong letter, because inside was originally an invoice for roses sent to Miss Dorothy Dunne, totaling fifty-two dollars.

I have no ill feelings towards Miss Dunne, but a woman like that needs money to cultivate. If you faithfully tell her that your weekly salary is twelve dollars and that there is no hope of an increase in the near future, you will surely find that she will not be close to you.

Of course, you are still far from the engagement stage, so when I find that you have the intention of getting married, I am a little apprehensive. A clerk who only earns twelve dollars a week and spends fifty-two dollars on roses needs not a wife but a manager. Later you will know how many meals can be bought with fifty-two dollars.

I thought you could seek my advice and judgment on actions like these, because when a son wants to buy a horse, he often consults with his father, but not when choosing a spouse. Marriage may be ordained by heaven, but in most cases it is decided in the dim corners, where when a man is pursuing a woman, because he rarely looks at the other party's family, all he can see are the other party's advantages, and he cannot discover the disadvantages. A person cannot choose his mother, but he can choose the mother of his children.

Remember, never marry a woman from a poor background who is raised like a rich family's daughter, because these women are fundamentally impractical. The reason I want to say these things to you is because I see that you have already embarked on the road to marriage, and if you continue like this, you will definitely encounter difficulties. And by that time, you won't understand why. You must also remember that if a woman marries you because she knows I have money, she is making a big mistake. I think if you know that you are talking about marriage with an income of twelve dollars a week, you should use that fifty-two dollars to buy a set of bedroom furniture (you can buy a set of furniture for fifty-two dollars in the United States).

Marriage is the most important thing in life, and yet there are many smart people in the world who make many mistakes, but when you marry an unsuitable spouse, you will have unnecessary pain for the rest of your life. You can really tell your lover your current situation, so that she does not become your wrong spouse.

Your loving father, Grell Heinrich

### A Week's Home Cooking Menu

— Ms. Hua Ying

When chrysanthemums are yellow, it is the season when the "Mr. No Intestines" (crab) roams the world. In the streets and alleys, there are crab stalls everywhere; men and women are carrying strings of crabs in their hands, which can be seen everywhere at any time. As for the price of crabs, it is really scaryly expensive. Larger ones cost more than ten yuan each, smaller ones cost seven or eight yuan or five or six yuan, and those costing three or four yuan each are too ordinary. In the author's family, they don't have much affection for boiled crabs, but they like to eat crab meat. They often spend four or five yuan to buy six or seven of them. After taking out the crab meat, they can make crab meat scrambled eggs with eggs; they can make crab meat tofu soup with tofu; sometimes they make a crab meat stir-fry with vegetables, or buy some noodles and eat crab meat noodles, which can be considered to be responding to the season and satisfying their cravings. In general families who love to eat crabs but are limited by their finances, why not do the same?
