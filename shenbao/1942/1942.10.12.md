### Heavy Fog and Snow in the Caucasus Impact German Operations; Shift in Focus of Warfare from Stalingrad to the Don River Bend Favorable for Soviets

Berlin, 10th (DPA)

German attacks in the northwestern Caucasus region have made considerable progress as of the 8th. Currently, operations in that area are greatly hampered due to heavy fog and snow.

Moscow, 11th (DPA)

According to the Soviet Information Bureau's afternoon communique, our forces continued operations northwest of Stalingrad and in the Mozdok area today. There were no changes in other areas.

Berlin, 11th (Havas)

According to recent frontline reports, weather conditions have begun to affect military operations along the entire Eastern Front. The heavy snow in the Caucasus is unexpected, and heavy snow in the central and northern regions is also sufficient to limit military activity. Therefore, only localized battles occurred on Friday. German forces continued to advance in the Tuapse area. German forces in the Terek area continued to advance towards the Grozny oil fields. Another German force, after clearing out the remaining enemy in the Maikop area, advanced along the railway line towards Oshkhonigiski, placing the Soviet forces in a very dangerous situation, especially with the Soviet left flank under the most pressure. The Soviet command was forced to order another retreat. German engineers demolished a skyscraper in Stalingrad. The building was located in the northern suburbs of the city. German engineers dug a tunnel to the building and planted explosives. All Soviet troops in the area were killed in the explosion. Apart from this, only artillery battles took place in the Stalingrad area. German air forces continued to attack Soviet supply lines in the rear. Soviet gunboats on the Volga River made several attacks, but were all repelled by German artillery positions on the east bank of the river. The Soviets lost several gunboats.

Somewhere on the Ukrainian Border, (Havas)

There have been no major developments on the Eastern Front in the past 24 hours. German forces continued to engage in mopping-up operations within Stalingrad in order to clear out the remaining enemy. Although the Red Army put up a resolute resistance, they were forced to abandon some territory. Currently, only the factory district within Stalingrad remains in Red Army hands. The attention of German military observers has shifted from the battle for Stalingrad to the major battle that has been taking place in the Don River bend for the past three days. The development of the war there is favorable to the Soviet Union. According to the latest news, the Red Army crossed the Don River three days ago and penetrated two kilometers into German lines. They are now trying to hold the new positions and strengthen their defenses to hold on. In fierce fighting all day yesterday, the Red Army also gained a bridgehead on the west bank of the Don River. Neutral observers say that regardless of the outcome of this battle, it will not change the fate of Stalingrad. The Red Army may not be able to recover this important industrial center. However, if successful in the area between the Don and Volga Rivers, the German forces in the Caucasus will suffer a major blow. The recent slowing of the German advance in the Terek River basin is due to this. As for the rumors that German forces launched an offensive in the Kalmyk region, attempting to advance on Astrakhan, this has been denied by responsible parties. However, it is not impossible for the Germans to launch an offensive in the very near future.

### Soviets Begin Training Ski Troops in Preparation for Winter Warfare

### German Attack in Central Sector Unsuccessful

Stockholm, 11th (Havas)

Several war dispatches have just been received from the Eastern Front, the most noteworthy of which is that yesterday, under the cover of artillery fire, aircraft, and armored vehicles, German forces in the central sector launched a fierce attack on Red Army positions. After a Red Army counterattack, the positions of both sides remained unchanged, but the exact location was not specified. It was generally in the Rzhev area or northwest of Smolensk. The purpose of this move by the German forces was to test the strength of the Red Army. It had previously been reported that the Red Army had concentrated forces in that area. However, this German attack in the central sector may not be the beginning of a large-scale German offensive.

### German Submarine Activity Expands to the South African Coast; British and American Supply Lines Threatened; German Propaganda Announces Allied Oil Tanker Losses Reach 4.6 Million Tons

Berlin, 10th (Havas)

The German High Command recently issued a communique stating that German submarines have opened a new battlefield off the coast of South Africa, and military operations are proceeding very smoothly. Since the Arctic Ocean supply line is threatened by German submarines, Britain and the United States are now paying attention to operating the South Africa to Persian Gulf supply line, which can not only supply the Soviet Union but also serve as a supply line for Egypt and India. Therefore, South African ports are extremely important for British and American ships.

Berlin, 11th (Havas)

Responsible military figures here announced last night that since the beginning of the war, German naval and air forces have sunk enemy oil tankers totaling 4.6 million tons. On May 12 of this year, the German military authorities announced that the sunk British and American oil tankers totaled 3.1 million tons. Since then, German submarines have intensified their activities off the coasts of the United States, the Caribbean Sea, the Atlantic Ocean off West Africa, and the Mediterranean Sea. From May to early October of this year, they sunk a total of 215 enemy oil tankers, totaling 1.5 million tons, bringing the total to 4.6 million tons. From the United States' entry into the war until May 12 of this year, a total of 105 oil tankers were sunk.

Berlin, 11th (Havas)

Authoritative sources here released the following list last night regarding enemy oil tankers sunk: *Kennebec* (U.S.), 10,600 tons; *Kirkland* (Norway), 7,455 tons; *Samuel Q. H. Moffett* (U.S.), 9,974 tons; *Donovania* (British), 8,150 tons; *San Caspado* (British), 12,910 tons; *Sturevaar* (Norway), 6,030 tons; *Little Havers* (British), 6,990 tons; *Vimiera* (British), 5,728 tons; *Harwood* (U.S.), 6,610 tons; *Sadler* (U.S.), 9,630 tons.

### American Giant Troop Transport Sunk by German Submarine

Berlin, 11th (Havas)

According to the German High Command, submarine commander Walkering reported that on September 25, at around 4:00 PM, a giant troop transport was discovered, resembling the 19,627-ton *Viceroy of India*. Two escorting destroyers, having apparently detected the submarine, dropped depth charges. The ship also fled south. It was eventually sunk by the second submarine. The time and location reported by the two submarines completely matched the location reported by submarine commander Hellriegel for the sinking of the giant ship *Pacifico I*, 17,702 tons. On the same night, Walkering heard an explosion and saw a flash of light, similar to the location where Hellriegel reported sinking the giant ship *Pacifico I*, 17,702 tons.

### Argentina and Chile Protest to the United States, Deny Axis Elements Engaging in Activities Within Their Borders

Buenos Aires, 11th (Havas)

The Argentine Foreign Minister announced last night that the Argentine authorities have instructed the Argentine ambassador to the United States to express to the U.S. government the Argentine government's extreme dissatisfaction with the speech delivered by U.S. Undersecretary of State Welles. The Argentine government's official statement on the matter stated that Argentina had made a concrete guarantee to the U.S. government on July 1 of this year to take measures to prevent Axis nationals from engaging in espionage activities within Argentina. Welles' remarks are an insult to Argentina. Welles' claim that the sinking of certain ships was due to the Argentine government is unacceptable. The locations where the ships were sunk are far from Argentine territorial waters. The facts are all there. How can Argentina be held responsible?

Washington, 10th (Havas)

Undersecretary of State Welles stated yesterday that the losses of some Allied merchant ships were due to the fact that Axis elements were able to operate within the borders of Chile and Argentina. Chilean Ambassador to the United States, Miguel, personally visited President Roosevelt today on behalf of the government to lodge a protest. The meeting lasted 45 minutes, and Undersecretary Welles was also present. Upon leaving the White House, the ambassador told reporters that he had lodged a protest in writing in addition to the oral negotiations, but that the talks were friendly. As for his country's President Ríos being invited to visit the United States as head of state, there is no reason to delay the trip, and President Roosevelt is preparing a grand welcome for his country's head of state.

### Abolition of Red Army Political Commissars; Stalin Explains the Reasons; Berlin Pays Close Attention

Lisbon, 10th (DPA)

According to reports from Turkey, Stalin has ordered the abolition of the political commissars dispatched by the Communist Party in the Red Army. All current political commissars will be placed in the military structure. Therefore, the Communist Party's control over the Red Army has been abolished in principle. Stalin explained the reasons for abolishing the political commissars, saying that political commissars had a value in the Soviet era for all Red Army soldiers, but this war has proven that political commissars are no longer necessary.

Istanbul, 11th (Havas)

Moscow Radio commentator Mitrev defended the Soviet authorities' reform of the political commissar system in the military last night, saying that the reform was based on the party's line. Lenin and Stalin both advocated strict organization and discipline, especially attention to the unity of command. Now that the front and rear should implement iron discipline even more, a new decree was promulgated to strengthen the combat effectiveness.

Berlin, 10th (Havas)

German authorities are paying close attention to the Soviet Union's abolition of the Red Army Political Department (political commissars were originally stationed at all levels of the military), but have not commented on its reasons or speculated on its consequences. The general public believes that the Soviet authorities, in light of the Red Army's repeated defeats, want to reduce the responsibility of party and government leaders, and that Stalin intends to unify military command to cope with the current military situation.

After the Shanghai branches of the Zhejiang Local, Jiangsu, and Jiangxi Yumin Banks suspended operations and were liquidated under the supervision of officials appointed by the authorities, all accounts have been checked and funds are being returned to depositors in stages starting from the 5th of this month. In addition to notifying each depositor in writing, it is hoped that all depositors will quickly come to claim their funds to clear the debt. The business hours of each bank are from 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM. Sundays are closed. Regarding the old currency deposits of each bank in the past, all have been converted into Chinese banknotes at a ratio of two to one, and interest on deposits of suspended banknotes will be paid according to the rates stipulated by each bank.

### French Concession Residence Permits Are Being Issued Sequentially

An expanded news agency reporter learned that since the French Concession resident identity cards were issued by the various district police stations at the beginning of June this year, residents in areas such as Avenue Joffre are still receiving them daily. The Public Concession has completed the distribution, and all relocation matters are being handled by the Baojia chiefs, who instruct all residents to complete the reporting and registration procedures. The distribution has not yet started in the western part of Shanghai, but the reporter learned that those responsible for implementing this matter plan to implement it in the near future and have decided to give priority to young men between the ages of twenty and forty-five in order to strengthen the organization of groups similar to the Public Concession Self-Defense Corps and the French Concession Civil Police Corps.

### International Red Cross is Responsible for Receiving and Sending Overseas Letters

The English "Times" reports that since the International Red Cross began handling the delivery of letters in early May, 35,000 letters from nationals of countries considered hostile and neutral countries in this city have been sent by the organization. It has been confirmed that 18,000 letters have been sent to Shanghai from other places. It is said that this phenomenon is sufficient to show that the postal routes are open. According to regulations, each resident can only send letters of up to 25 words per month. These letters must have a specific envelope and be delivered to the International Red Cross at 97 Yuanmingyuan Road. It is also learned that the Japanese Red Cross has also stipulated that it is permissible to receive and send letters through Chefoo, but these letters must not exceed 50 words.

### Brief News from All Sectors

Dismissal of Shantou Compatriots. The Guangdong Shanghai Associations Sending Compatriots Back Home Committee sent off four batches last month. This is the last batch of returning Cantonese. Because those in this batch were to be sent back home at the end of last month, only those whose documents were invalid or did not have time to prepare verification documents have been delayed until now. The Shantou portion still has to wait because the Cantonese ships do not sail to Shantou, which should be completed within this month. The China Merchant Steam Navigation Company has assisted greatly in the dismissal this time.

### Tongren Table Tennis Cup League: Postal and United Youth Teams Win Third Place; Held at the Western Police Gym at 7 PM Tonight

The group stage of the Tongren Cup Charitable Table Tennis Championship has been completed after a month of round-robin matches.

People from all walks of life can send letters to the Tongren Hospital Office at 219 Jiujiang Road to obtain admission tickets and enter with tickets. The Postal team has always been famous in the table tennis world and has very strong strength, with four knights including Wang Huizhang, Liu Zaoshi, Jiang Chunshan, and Ye Xiuzhang. Last time, due to bad luck, they were defeated by the United Youth team, which was quite unusual. The United Youth team is also an emerging force. This time, in the Ren group, they defeated strong teams such as the North American Post Star, and their record was remarkable. In the end, they were defeated by the San Yi team, which is full of talent, by only one point. Tonight, once they meet with the Postal team, both sides will have equal skills. It is difficult to predict who will win.

Weekly Market Commentary

### Seemingly True but Not, Seemingly False but True; Strange Questions, Clever Answers

A: Japan has a price control compensation system. Is it necessary to establish a compensation system in this city?

B: Retail donations, food and drink, entertainment donations, etc., may not all be reported and paid in full. This can also be regarded as a disguised compensation system. (Editor's note: All such items should be fully reported and paid in full according to law.)

A: I heard that the authorities are now strictly prohibiting banking and financial industries from engaging in real estate transactions, so what should we do?

B: Real estate transactions, etc., are the regular business of the trust departments of various banks and firms. The operation of such transactions by the trust department is in accordance with the law and reason and is not prohibited. (Editor's note: The trust department is set up for customer commissions, not for the bank's own commissions.)

A: How much capital do you have? Today this family, tomorrow that family, it seems to have an inexhaustible strength to be a supervisor.

B: After becoming a director or supervisor, I will sell the stock, so I will not have the qualifications to be a director or supervisor in another company? (Editor's note: According to the Company Law, if you are a promoter, you cannot transfer your shares in the first year of the company's new establishment. At present, one person holds many positions as directors and supervisors of new companies, and I am afraid that most of them are gifted shares. The company aims to borrow celebrity to increase its reputation, similar to European and American specialized promoters.)

Market Trends

### Government Bonds Surge

The bond market trend is as expected by this publication. Last week, it showed a violent reversal and unprecedented surge. In five days, each bond exceeded the 60 yuan mark, and C bond even reached a peak of 64 yuan. This is not because the reporter's prediction is correct, but it is a natural trend in the situation. It is also heard that the merger and reorganization of the old and new securities industry associations is nearing completion, and on Friday, a telegram was sent to Nanjing requesting the authorities to maintain bond credibility. According to our observation, this kind of request seems to have no reason to refuse, but it will definitely not be accepted unconditionally. The possible conditions are nothing more than (1) the issue of new chips entering the market, (2) the magnitude of market price fluctuations, (3) the establishment of market supervision, etc. As for the issue of inheriting the unified payment of principal and interest of each bond, it may also be discussed again, but the result will not exceed the principles stated at the beginning of the year.

Regarding the future trend of each bond, it will depend on whether the above news is reliable and how the results are resolved. During the confusing period, the trend will tighten the circulating chips and continue to move forward. However, this publication has repeatedly stated that at this time and place, the observation of the bond market cannot but be thought of on both sides. The various points of this journal's discussion on the future bond market have already proved to be correct in the current market trends, but it is still necessary to read it carefully in order to know that another factor should not be prevented. In other words, the trend is still strong in reason, but its excessive rise is not a good sign. The so-called "throwing the mouse and being afraid of breaking the vase" must be known. Knowing this, the recent and future market trends should move towards the adjustment of prices between each bond. Once the protruding angle is smoothed, wait for the appearance of a new peak, otherwise, it will be discussed separately.

### Prosperity of Chinese Stocks

Last week's trend of Chinese stocks was also as expected by this publication. The peaks of new Chinese stocks rose sharply, especially the stocks of New Asia, which were greatly affected by the expansion of the New Asia Capital Group. The authorities in New Asia are skilled in their sleeves, and all industries operated within the capital group are thriving.

Recently, a capital investment company with a capital of 10 million yuan has been organized. Shareholders of various companies under the New Asia system have priority in subscribing for shares, so there is a lot of searching for high-quality, discerning hands, and the rise of the Five Continents Xinyi Zhongfa has led to the trend of the times. The pharmaceutical industry in winter is entering a good situation. As the end of the business year approaches, shareholders' reluctance to sell their shares easily is the general reason for the current upward trend in the Chinese stock market.

The textile stock is not as favorable as the new pharmaceutical stock. The market is generally tired, and the situation is generally seen that the second and fourth factories of Xiao Cuiyu Qiao An Yarn Factory were originally under military management. This time, they were listed as being returned, and the market price rose sharply by more than 200 yuan. However, the various textile factories in this city are currently in extreme labor reduction. According to the "Dongbao" report, the eight yarn factories such as Shenxin that were returned in the past five months have a total of 354,000 spindles, but the recent operating rate is only 30%. As the largest Shenxin Yarn Factory has an operating rate of less than 13% (see the "Daily News" on the 8th), its difficult situation can be imagined.

It is found that the factories returned this time include the second and fourth factories of Wing On Yarn Factory, Hengfeng Yarn Factory, Taicang Liaotai Yarn Factory, Weicheng Liji Silk Factory, Huafeng Paper Mill, and Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company. The stocks of factories such as Hengfeng were originally rarely traded and should be discussed separately. The market value of Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company, whose stocks were usually traded, did not benefit as much as Wing On Yarn Factory's stocks, which is more noteworthy.

However, from the perspective of the entire Chinese stock market, except for the approach of the end of the business year, the current situation is not better than other times, and there are two factors that are rising to prominence. One is that in autumn, the funds in the market have a tendency to carry out and buy local products. The other is that the government bond market has no retreat, and the floating funds flowing into the bond market from the stock market may also be considerable. Therefore, except for special circumstances, even if there is a general upward possibility in the stock market trend, it may not be possible to place more expectations for a while.

### Yarn, Cloth, and Woolen Fabrics

The sharp edge of yarn and cloth is exhausted. Feng Ma lingers in the original range of the previous week, and there is nothing to pay attention to. The progress of piece goods is also slow, and there are signs of decline. Recently, new cloth shops have sprung up like mushrooms after a rain, and the psychological distress of the holders can be imagined.

### Seasonal Western Medicine

It is already near winter, and Shanghai people also call the summer when tonic and seasonal epidemics are prevalent as the medicine industry season. In summer, most of the medicines are used by the poor, because they are more likely to be infected with seasonal epidemics than the rich. The situation is reversed in winter. Those who can take tonic are all rich, so the market is weak first and then strong. The market for various tonics is quite strong. In addition, it is not easy to purchase sugar, and the sales of saccharin have soared, and the market price has risen accordingly.

### Oil and Sugar Market Conditions

After the implementation of the rationing system for edible oil and sugar, the panic about oil and sugar in this city has been alleviated, but recently the old habits have reappeared. The main reason is that the number of people buying in front of the oil shop is long, and the long snake array does not disperse all day long. The main reason is the reduction of the rationing amount and the allocation of the retail amount everywhere. The reason is that the supply from the place of origin is insufficient and the source is obstructed.

According to the Dongbao report, the various raw oil factories in Qingdao are currently reducing or even suspending work because the price of peanut raw materials is very expensive, and the price of oil products is seeing the same suffering due to the rationing system. Therefore, the various oil presses have stopped and reduced work in cooperation. In order to overcome this situation, the authorities are now organizing the North China Oil Association in order to increase production and adjust market prices.

### Hardware Fever

Although the price rationing is severe, the speculation in foreign goods has not been reduced at all. Within the last week, the sharp rise and fall has not been reduced compared to before the rationing.

October 2, 7, 8

British Brand 6200 8800 8550

Old Knife Brand 6450 7150 7050

Gu Ben Soap 285 235 325

Bai Xiangmao 240 370 265

This violent change is said to be caused by the reduction of the rationing amount. If this statement is true, then the rationing system cannot be regarded as a price rationing.

### Drive Forward

— Zhang Zirong

According to the calendars used in Europe before the fourth and fifth centuries, October 12th is the anniversary of Columbus's discovery of the new continent of America. Although the correct date calculated according to the current calendar is October 21st (or October 23rd, it is not known which is correct), but for the sake of habit, today is considered the 450th anniversary of Columbus's discovery of the new continent.

Columbus's discovery of the new continent was an accidental event, but he was a man of extraordinary perseverance. He had a firm will and a spirit of not fearing difficulties and hardships. This is undeniable. Therefore, although the discovery of the new continent was accidental, it was not discovered by others, but by this Genoese early morning adventurer. This was not accidental.

Let us imagine that when those three sailboats continued to sail in the vast and angry sea for fifty or sixty days, and all that was seen around was still a vast ocean, the sailors traveling with them were afraid, and the ship was full of complaints. Food was reduced, and many people demanded that the bow of the ship be turned back. However, Columbus still ordered with a hundred times the courage: "Drive forward!" The discovery of the new continent in the Western Hemisphere and the turning of world history all depended on this indomitable spirit.

Sailors in the ocean of life, do not be afraid when you encounter storms. We must remember the order given by Columbus: Drive forward!

Historical Tale

### Columbus and the New Continent

— Jiaji

A major event that shifted the direction of history occurred 450 years ago, but no one knew it at the time, not even the hero who played the leading role.

But the event did happen. On the morning of October 12, 1492, three sailboats suddenly sailed to the waters of the Western Hemisphere, the gathering place of the red barbaric people. Then, a group of people wearing complicated clothes landed. The red people were surprised and thought that these uninvited guests must have descended from the sky. After sailing for about 70 days in the turbulent ocean, the people on the ship suddenly saw the land and were overjoyed, thinking that their destination had been reached and their mission had been completed. They thought they had discovered a new route to the European craftsman, but they did not expect that what they had discovered was the new continent of America.

Needless to say, these three sailboats and eighty-eight sailors were led by an Italian named Columbus. They set off from the port of Palos in August and encountered storms and waves along the way. Also, because Columbus's calculations were not very accurate, the destination was not reached after exceeding the estimated date, which caused the sailors to shrink back and complain along the way. Columbus had to encourage and comfort them and ask everyone to continue moving forward. Finally, because of his firm faith and extraordinary courage, they reached their destination and also unexpectedly discovered the new continent of America.

Columbus's voyage was sponsored by Queen Isabella of Spain, so out of gratitude, he declared all the places he discovered to be Spanish territory and also used the names of the Spanish emperor and queen as the names of some places to show his remembrance.

Columbus saw the Indians naked and uncultured, so he felt pity and decided to preach Catholic doctrine to them and establish colonies there. At first, he originally wanted to bring the gold and silver treasures of the East back to Europe after discovering the route, but this wish was never realized. However, he still regarded the places he reached as Asia.

Although he encountered various difficulties when he went to the new continent, he was even falsely accused of corruption and渎职 at one point and was assigned back to Spain like a prisoner, but his spirit was not damaged or frustrated in the slightest. He simply devoted himself to the new continent he discovered. He went back and forth four times. On May 20, 1506, this Columbus, known as the admiral of the sea, died as an ordinary explorer at the age of sixty in his simple hut. On the wall of the hut hung an iron chain, indicating that he had been a prisoner.

### Occasional Words

— Lü Lü

There used to be an idiom saying "Eat more, talk less," but now it's best to change it to "Eat less, don't talk."

Eloquence is silver, silence is gold, but action is diamond.

A cricket may win a hundred times at a good door, but it fails at the hundred and first time, and from then on, it no longer chirps or opens its mandibles.

It is said that after Yama caught Zhi, he threw him into the eighteenth level of hell. Zhi suffered the greatest pain there, but he heard a groaning sound below him. Upon asking, the voice said, "I am your teacher, Liu Xiahui. Yama punished me and put me in the nineteenth level, saying that Zhi was taught by me."

People can be divided into two types: one that exhausts its power trying to reach heaven, and one whose roots exhaust themselves trying to sink into hell.

A publisher said to Samuel Johnson, "Don't be a poet, be a porter." This statement still holds its truth today.

Blown by the wind, the peanut scatters its flowers and then bears fruit on the ground.

A spark on a cigarette butt bursts in the darkness: I am revelation.

The small grass on the mountaintop, the ancient pine on the hillside, do you say this is an insult?

The pen is truly a knife, scraping all the flesh from my cheeks.

### The Theatrical Life

— Liang Can

(1) From Amateur to Professional

Being able to call acting in spoken drama a profession is only a matter of the last three or four years. Although spoken drama first appeared in China thirty years ago, at the beginning of the Republic of China, for the past twenty years, spoken drama has always been seen as a trivial skill, not fit for the refined. Because at that time, all techniques were still in their infancy and not enough to arouse the interest of the audience, every performance would always require one to pay out of pocket and lose money. For these past twenty-odd years, the life of spoken drama has been continuously maintained, albeit faintly, by many enthusiastic spoken drama pioneers using amateur drama clubs. But this period of honing techniques has finally passed, and various skills have slowly matured. Excellent scripts have been produced, and good actors have also emerged. Spoken drama is no longer a simple and crude entertainment performance for the audience, but a new type of comprehensive art. Thus, professional theater troupes have only just begun to gain a foothold. But as of today, spoken drama in the entertainment sector has developed to a point second only to Peking opera and film, which are also booming. It has nineteen professional theater troupes, seven or eight first-class theaters, and nearly a thousand employees, including playwrights, directors, actors, stage workers, and craftsmen. In terms of business, it has also produced a record of a play running for three months, and now about ten thousand viewers flock to it every day, spending the price of seeing two movies to appreciate this so-called comprehensive art, and what is most directly expressed to the audience in this art is the actor.

(2) The Pay of Spoken Drama

Actors occupy a very important position in a theater troupe. Externally, the strength of the cast can determine whether a play is a commercial success or not. Internally, actors are the most numerous and also the class with the most personnel disputes. Actors in ordinary professional theater troupes can be divided into two types: one is the basic actor, who has a contract with the troupe and can only perform in that troupe; the other is the special guest actor, who is invited as a non-member guest performer due to a shortage of people or for special needs. In terms of remuneration, basic actors are paid monthly (regardless of the number of performances, they always receive money according to the contract). According to the current situation, the salary of basic actors is about two hundred to six or seven hundred yuan per month, depending on the situation of each theater troupe. Special guest actors are paid based on the number of performances, roughly from four or five yuan to more than ten yuan per performance. This high salary has only been raised in the last half year due to the excessive number of theater troupes being established and the competition for talent among them. However, considering the current cost of living, it is not easy for third-rate actors who earn two or three hundred yuan to make a living. As for first-rate actors who earn six or seven hundred yuan a month, it is only enough for the cost of a single outfit and a pair of shoes. It costs a lot to look good on stage. However, every profession produces its top talents. There are also some actors who can afford to hang the banner of leading stars, and their income is either twenty percent of the total revenue or one yuan per ticket, earning thousands of gold a night, which is another matter.

### Three Identities of a Doctor

It is said that in the eyes of a patient, a doctor has three identities:

When invited to the patient's bedside - an angel

When the ailment is cured - a God

When asking for consultation and medicine fees - a devil

### Sharing the Same Boat Through Storms

— He Jia Zhi

(10) Flying Peak

To Huang Long, walking ten or eight miles in the darkness was nothing, but Cui Zhen couldn't just let him carry her all the way. Not far after leaving Sheng Hu Shan's house, she said, "Mr. Huang, let me down." Huang Huang stopped and said, "Sister Cui Zhen, you called me Mr. Huang? When have I ever been a Mr.? That address isn't right." Cui Zhen said, "Oh, Brother Huang Long, please put me down." Huang Long said, "Only if you call me 'husband' will I put you down. Otherwise, I still have to discuss your age with you. Is it Brother Huang Long or Younger Brother Huang Long? Make it clear before I put you down." Cui Zhen slid down from Huang Long's back onto the embankment. Opposite them was a grave surrounded by many cypress trees, which blocked the wind for them. Huang Long watched Cui Zhen sit on the ground and said again, "Sister Cui Zhen, you can't walk straight. I'll still carry you." Cui Zhen said, "If you carry me, I really wouldn't dare. Are you afraid they'll come after us?" Huang Long said, "What are you saying? Would I be afraid of them? Alright, Sister Cui Zhen, let me sit for half an hour before walking. If they come in half an hour, I'll use my civil and military skills to beat them until they run away with their tails between their legs. Sister Cui Zhen, this isn't Huang Long bragging. You don't even need to hide, just sit here and open your eyes and watch." Huang Long's words were so forceful, not like they were rolling off his tongue, but rather like they were being chewed out of his teeth.

Cui Zhen originally wanted to sit for a while and then slowly try to stand up to see if she could walk, but now, hearing Huang Long's stubborn tone, she was eager to support herself and walk. She leaned on a small tree beside the path, stood up, and said, "I can walk. Let's go. I've already taken the Ye family as my home." Huang Long said, "No, you sit for half an hour before walking. Sit down, sit down. If I commit a crime, it's because I followed the orders of that plague official. But you should listen to my words, it's my order. Sit down." Cui Zhen somewhat knew that he would do what he said, so she had to sit down again and said with a smile, "Brother Huang Long, when did you come to the Ye family? I really appreciate you. How did you know I was there?" Huang Long laughed and said, "Me? I have a lot to say." (200)
