### Discussion on the European and African War Situation

The Second World War, as it has developed to this day, can be mainly divided into four major battlefields: one is the Greater East Asia War centered on the Pacific Ocean, one is the German-Soviet War in Eastern Europe, one is the British-German War in Western Europe, and the other is the North African War from the Mediterranean Sea to Africa; in addition, there is the Egyptian War, which is relatively secondary. Among these war centers, the more important ones are only the Greater East Asia War in the East, dominated by Japan, and the Eastern European War in the West, dominated by Germany and the Soviet Union. However, since Japan launched the Greater East Asia War, it has greatly helped Germany and Italy in their operations in Europe and Africa, and has made the European and African Wars and the Asian War move closer to convergence day by day. Therefore, it is very necessary for us to observe and study the European and African War at present.

Since the outbreak of the German-Soviet War on June 22 last year, the focus of the European and African War has shifted to Eastern Europe and the territory of the Soviet Union, where the two sides have staged an unprecedented fierce battle in history. However, it is still affected by the seasons to some extent. Observing the German strategy, it is generally based on winter as the preparation period, spring as the offensive period, and even if the war develops to its peak in summer, autumn becomes the period for consolidating and expanding the war. Looking back, after the German army launched a war against the Soviet Union last year, it drove straight in and approached the capital Moscow, and Leningrad was almost completely under the control of the German army; however, due to seasonal factors, the Soviet Union was assisted by various armies, which made the German-Soviet War suddenly become deadlocked, and the German army was engaged in the preparation period for a new offensive. At the turn of this spring, the German army began to launch an offensive again, capturing Kharkov, the capital of Ukraine, and Sevastopol, an important town in southern Russia, and approaching Stalingrad in autumn. However, also due to seasonal factors, the German-Soviet War entered a deadlock again. Stalin more solemnly denounced the mistakes of the United Kingdom and the United States in failing to open up a second front in the past year, which led to the passive and failed position of the United Nations, and called for the development of the second front in an attempt to change the entire war situation.

The United Kingdom and the United States have always adopted a perfunctory attitude towards Stalin's demand for a second front. The verbal and written statements seem very lively, but in fact there has never been any sincerity. Therefore, since last summer, the British-German War in Western Europe has always been sluggish, and even in the North African Egyptian War, the United Kingdom and the United States have only adopted a passive strategy and have often been in a position of failure. However, since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the power of the United Kingdom and the United States in the Pacific has frequently collapsed. Not only has the Southwest Pacific fallen into the hands of the Japanese army, but also the gunpowder depot of India has begun to explode. The Japanese military power has frequently advanced towards the Indian Ocean, and India, the so-called crown of the British Empire, is under the threat of Japanese planes and gunboats, and the German and Italian troops also have a tendency to meet with the Japanese army through the Red Sea. In this way, if the United Kingdom does not make other plans, it will be in danger of collapsing immediately. This is the first reason why the United Kingdom and the United States have to prepare to launch a counter-offensive in Europe and Africa. Secondly, the Mediterranean Sea is the lifeline of the United Kingdom, and it is also the base for the United Kingdom and the United States to maintain contact with the Soviet Union and strive for advantages in Turkey today. However, due to the development of German and Italian forces, the British position in the Mediterranean has been declining day by day. The British military bases there, such as Gibraltar and Malta, have been reduced in value due to the development of the Italian air force, so that in the recent year, the connection between Gibraltar and the Suez Canal has been blocked by the Axis air and sea forces, and the connection between the United Kingdom and the United States to aid the Soviet Union and India has had to bypass the Cape of Good Hope in South Africa and pass through the distant route of the Indian Ocean. On the contrary, Italy has placed the focus of the Mediterranean strategic system on the line connecting Sicily and Terrelia with Tripoli in Libya, and the line connecting Vedesleslos with Dobruk in Libya, dividing the Mediterranean into east and west, and cutting off the lifeline of the United Kingdom. Especially in the western Mediterranean, the weakness of the United Kingdom is becoming increasingly obvious. In the past, it had to rely on French military power. Since its ally France, Luo Wu, the western Mediterranean has to be threatened by the Axis powers. The failure of the British naval battle in the western Mediterranean from June to August this year is the most obvious example. All the above-mentioned realistic situations have forced the United Kingdom to either perish or counter-attack, and the Soviet Union and the United States are obviously more willing to help the British counter-attack. This is the root cause of the recent North African War.

The main purpose of the British and American invasion of North Africa is to try to change from a strategic defensive to an offensive, and seize the initiative from the Axis powers. Judging from their careful preparations and considerable large-scale combat plans, their daring to invade this time should not be underestimated or underestimated. The intention of the British and American invasion of North Africa is obviously to establish a foothold there in order to launch an offensive against the European continent. Therefore, the battle in North Africa must be regarded as having the inevitability of expanding to the Mediterranean region. This is an observation from the entire strategy. Secondly, the British and American troops invaded North Africa in an attempt to seize Algiers, Oran, and Bizerte in Tunisia, which have become one of the strategic system hubs in the Mediterranean, in order to strengthen their military strategic position in the Mediterranean. Bizerte is a powerful base against Pantelleria in Italy, and Tunis is the strategic point with the shortest distance from Africa to the Italian mainland. From here to Pantelleria, it is only 60 kilometers, and from Pantelleria to Sicily, it is only 96 kilometers. Therefore, the British and American forces concentrated their offensive on Tunisia, and the German and Italian forces did not hesitate to give up the Mediterranean strongholds such as Dobruk, Derna, and Benghazi, and concentrated their forces to launch a counter-offensive in Tunisia. This is an observation on the focus of the defense of North Africa and the Mediterranean War. Again, we must know that the Mediterranean Sea has close interests with more than half of the countries in Europe in terms of politics and economy, especially France, Spain, Portugal, and Turkey in the east, and the Balkan countries in the northeast. Their positions often have a profound or even decisive impact depending on the situation in the Mediterranean. The British and American offensive in North Africa obviously has a certain degree of political and economic temptation for these countries. Judging from the conspiracy of the French navy in Toulon to participate in a major rebellion, one can infer its more far-reaching conspiracy. As for dealing with the Soviet Union's demand for a second front, it is naturally one of the reasons for exaggerating the North African offensive. This is also revealed to some extent in Stalin's conversation with American reporters and Churchill's report in Parliament.

Of course, it is still too early to predict the development prospects of the European and African War today. Although the British and American forces have invaded North Africa, and the French military officers in North Africa and West Africa have also established rebellious regimes under the leadership of Dazhu and De Gaulle; however, if they cannot develop to establish their dominance in the Mediterranean, especially if they cannot ensure their advantage in Tunisia, they will not become a decisive force that can dominate the European war situation; moreover, the development of the situation is even more distant from the British and American attempts: first, the decisive war is being carried out between Tunis and Bizerte, and Germany and Italy have taken back the initiative to their side; second, the French rebellion has been quelled under the lightning suppression of Germany and Italy, and France has further cooperated with Germany and Italy on the path of "integration"; third, what is particularly noteworthy is that the German army resolutely stationed in the port of Toulon and disarmed the French army and navy that were preparing to rebel. Although the tragic incident of all the rebellious French sailors sinking the warship was staged, after the Suiyi occupied Toulon, not only was the danger of the French south being invaded by the British and American forces again, but also the national defense strength of Italy itself was further strengthened, and the superior situation of the Axis powers in the Mediterranean was strengthened, breaking the above-mentioned strategic, political and economic attempts of the British and American sides. What is particularly noteworthy is that in this desperate offensive, not only did the United Kingdom and the United States not draw out any major forces from the German side on the eastern front, but they also failed to save the humiliation of continuing to be defeated miserably in the East. The recent disastrous defeat in the Solomon Islands battle shows that the most important factor in the failure of the British and American strategies in Europe and Africa has been discovered in the Pacific.

### Anniversary of the Tripartite Pact Japanese Prime Minister Issues Statement To Advance Rapidly Towards Victory with a Firm War Goal

Tokyo, 10th Central News Agency Electric Japan signed a military alliance treaty with Germany and Italy on December 11 last year, that is, this day is the anniversary of the three countries working together to destroy the United Kingdom and the United States, and since then, the Greater East Asia War and the European War have been integrated, and advanced towards the road of defeating the United Kingdom and the United States and building a new world order. On the occasion of the anniversary, Japanese Prime Minister Tojo Hideki met with the German and Italian journalist groups at the Prime Minister's official residence at 4 pm on the 9th, and reiterated the noble belief of the three countries in signing the treaty and rebuilding the world, and answered questions with the German and Italian journalists for an hour. Now I record the questions and answers of Prime Minister Tojo to the journalist group as follows: I am very happy to have the opportunity to meet with the journalist groups of the allied countries Germany and Italy today. However, there may be some cases that cannot be answered about war opportunities. I am a soldier, and I cannot speak euphemistically. I will only answer frankly to what I know. (Question) The enemy countries United Kingdom and the United States, such as Churchill, went to Moscow, and Willkie also went to Chongqing from Moscow. How frequent are the exchanges? What is the Prime Minister's opinion? (Answer) On December 11 last year, Japan, Germany, and Italy signed a treaty to establish a solid alliance, and at the same time established the three major principles of completing the joint operation of the three countries against the United Kingdom and the United States, and the three countries will never make peace alone, and build a new world order. In this way, at the beginning of the war, the three countries had formed an alliance with complete common goals in everything, politically, and spiritually. Based on this, the three countries have recently achieved great results and continue to move forward. As a result, the United Kingdom and the United States, which have suffered repeated defeats, have become extremely panic and are running around, hoping to reverse the decline. If we observe the above situation, then the military, political, and diplomatic advantages of our three countries are superior to those of the enemy countries, which is needless to say. In addition, I would like to add that, in terms of the nature of this war, the purpose of the three countries' operations is based on morality. The three countries share a strong determination to break the old order of the past and build a new order, and are a group of countries advancing towards the same goal. This is the true meaning of the three countries. The United Kingdom and the United States are determined to maintain the old world order and preserve their own interests. The collapse of all selfish country groups is inevitable. (Question) At the beginning of the Greater East Asia War, the enemy's bases in East Asia were destroyed with the momentum of a whirlwind. What way will the war be conducted in the second year? (Answer) All groups have a firm war purpose when declaring war on foreign countries. Those who start a war without a purpose have never been seen. Since the start of the Greater East Asia War, Japan has completely captured all the strategic strongholds of the enemy countries United Kingdom and the United States in East Asia in the first year. The purpose of future operations is to cooperate with Germany and Italy and advance towards rapid victory. (Question) Has Japan actually applied the resources of the occupied southern region to complete the operation? (Answer) The southern resources obtained by Japan are currently being applied, and considerable results have been achieved in actual operations. (Answer) I heard that the amount of southern oil obtained has exceeded the initial expected amount. Is this true? (Answer) The amount of southern oil has indeed exceeded the initial expected amount. According to the speculation at the time of the outbreak of the war, the enemy forces would inevitably destroy all the oil fields. Therefore, the Japanese army was determined to re-excavate them when it occupied them. However, when seizing the oil field areas, it tried its best to prevent the enemy forces from destroying them. Therefore, it is not unrelated to the fact that the amount exceeded the expected amount this time. In short, with the cooperation of Japan, Germany, and Italy, there is no need to worry about the lack of oil in completing the war in East Asia.

### In the Toropetz Region on the Eastern Front, the German Army is Making Smooth Progress Has Occupied Many Important Strongholds Soviet Troops in the Don River Bend Are Also Repelled

Headquarters of the German Leader, 10th Havas News Agency Electric This afternoon, the German military report stated that the enemy's vanguard between the Volga River and the Don River was surrounded and annihilated. The Soviet army launched several counterattacks, suffering heavy losses and failing. In a certain area the day before yesterday, the Soviet army lost 104 tanks. The German army in the Don River bend repelled the attacking enemy forces and destroyed 16 enemy tanks. In the central section of Eastern Europe, our army's offensive has been quite successful, capturing hundreds of enemy soldiers and seizing a large number of military weapons and supplies. Although the enemy attempted to counterattack, it was ineffective. German fighter planes and dive bombers bombed enemy troops and railway facilities. The German Air Force commando destroyed 59 enemy bunkers. In the Losev area, the Soviet army lost 72 tanks.

Berlin, 10th Havas News Agency Electric The German army's counterattack in the Toropetz area in the central section of the Eastern Front is starting to surround the Soviet army's ten divisions. Many Soviet strongholds have fallen into the hands of the German army. According to the latest news, the Stalin Corps, which is well-equipped and well-trained, is also in danger of being surrounded. The Soviet command is transferring troops to the Toropetz area to resist the German army's patrol offensive.

Berlin, 9th Havas News Agency Electric According to military sources here: (1) The German army launched a large-scale counterattack in the Toropetz area in the central section of the Eastern Front yesterday and achieved great success. The German army advanced steadily, gaining large tracts of land and occupying many densely populated areas and important positions. Although some positions of the Red Army were deeply deployed, they were still occupied. The Red Army's rear transportation line was also cut off. Although it is difficult to draw a conclusion on the current battle, it can be predicted that the results may be to annihilate about ten divisions of the Red Army. This army is composed of the "Stalin Group Army" specializing in offensive warfare and mixed elite troops. The number of tanks, artillery, automobiles, and heavy weapons destroyed by the German army is still difficult to estimate, but this number is constantly increasing. The number of prisoners is also increasing. The German Air Force, braving the bad weather, continuously attacked the enemy troops, giving the army a major boost. (2) In the Don River bend area, the German armored forces counterattacked the attacking Red Army, destroying 46 of its tanks, including several weighing more than 52 tons. The German tank force rushed through the Red Army's assault teams and defeated the Red Army in a large area. The Red Army was forced to retreat in panic. The air force pursued and achieved good results. The battle in the area is still in progress. (3) Between the Volga and Don Rivers, the Red Army repeatedly attacked with large teams of tanks, with great momentum, but was defeated everywhere. The enemy lost 56 tanks. (4) On the south side of Lake Ilmen, the enemy's strength is limited and the offensive is not strong, failing to break through the main German defense line. The German heavy artillery defeated the enemy tanks in the area, preventing them from concentrating. A Red Army unit that was surrounded south of Perai City a few days ago has now been completely annihilated. Only a few troops broke through and fled into the nearby forest area. (5) The German positions north and south of Erzhev have also been strengthened.

### The Lives of Inland Elementary School Teachers Under High Commodity Prices: Teacher morale is affected, and schools face extreme difficulty in hiring teachers

In recent years, the rapid rise in commodity prices in the mainland has made life increasingly difficult for those engaged in education. Taking elementary schools as an example, although teacher salaries have nominally increased, they inevitably lag behind the unlimited rise in commodity prices. The hardship they endure is not difficult to imagine.

There is a Cantonese saying that describes the hardship of elementary school teachers: "If you're not desperately poor, don't teach; if you're not starving, don't eat leftovers." To compare teaching to eating leftovers is truly a cause for sorrow!

The hardship of elementary school teachers' lives not only affects the morale of current teachers but also greatly affects the hiring of new teachers. The greatest pain for elementary school principals in the mainland now is their inability to hire teachers. Some elementary schools are nearing the end of the semester, but teacher vacancies still cannot be filled. This situation is quite common, and its severity cannot be ignored.

Guangxi Province has always valued grassroots education, and it constantly improves the salaries of grassroots education personnel and adopts a system of requisitioning goods in kind. For example, in some counties, elementary school teachers receive a living allowance of more than 30 yuan per month from the county government and are also entitled to receive 80 jin of rice (some receive 50 or 60 jin), collected from households by the town office. Such treatment makes it difficult to maintain even a minimum standard of personal living, but village and street chiefs often delay the payment of rice, so teachers are unable to solve their food problems and have to borrow from the kitchen. After a long time, the kitchen is also unable to support them, which will inevitably affect the teaching progress of the entire school. Some schools even open their doors in name only but are actually at a standstill. As for counties and cities that do not issue goods in kind but instead issue cash allowances, the situation is often similar. This phenomenon is not unique to Guangxi Province; other provinces are also like this. Here are a few examples to show a glimpse of the situation:

(1) A teacher from the Suqiao Township Central School in Lingui County reported: "...The problem of living here is difficult to solve. My salary is 36 yuan per month paid by the county government, and I also receive 50 jin of rice collected from various villages. But since February of this year, I have not been able to receive a single grain of rice. Most of my colleagues are locals and can still get help from their families, but I am from another town and am penniless, so how can I survive?"

(2) A teacher from a central school in Yongfu County reported: "…Our monthly living expenses rely on the government providing a few dozen yuan in salary and on students donating some rice or loaning money, but many poor students cannot afford it. At present, it is not enough to maintain the necessary nutrition. We no longer dare to hope to eat vegetables, let alone meat, and only hope to eat white rice. But because not much rice is cooked, after the last class bell rings every morning and afternoon, the teachers in the classroom, regardless of whether they have finished the lesson, all rush to the dining hall to grab rice to eat. The impact on students' studies and psychology is very great."

(3) A supervisory official in Liujiang County reported: "...The principal of the central school in the town was dismissed by the county government because the town chief could not issue rice as promised, so he led all the teachers of the school to question the town chief."

The income of elementary school teachers in Guangdong Province is about 80 or 90 yuan per month for those who are paid well, and only 30 or 40 yuan for those who are paid less. There is also a distinction between "directly affiliated" and "non-directly affiliated" schools. Teaching in "directly affiliated" schools is naturally more likely to receive preferential treatment. In addition, Guangdong also has a "school rice" system, which collects one catty of rice per month from each student, but because the collection methods vary greatly from place to place and there are many difficulties, it is not easy to achieve fairness, so the lives of teachers are still difficult to stabilize.

Secondly, due to the lack of funds for elementary schools, it is impossible to achieve complete equipment. In some remote counties, in addition to broken-down buildings, there is simply no equipment to speak of. Even newspapers are missing. Teachers are in closed countryside and have no contact with the outside world. They are ignorant of the major domestic situation and international trends. The spiritual pain is no less than the material difficulties.

In recent years, the Ministry of Education of the Chongqing government has repeatedly issued announcements emphasizing education, promoting national education, and improving teacher salaries. The pronouncements are voluminous and logical, and the educational expenditures are even more considerable. However, the treatment of elementary school teachers, who bear the mission of grassroots education, is still just lip service, with no action taken. How can it be called promoting education? How can it be called making improvements?

### Cooking Oil on Sale Today: Sugar Purchase Restrictions Relaxed: Oil Stores Merged for Sale to Facilitate Supervision: Each Household Can Purchase 40 Yuan Worth of Sugar with Housing Tax Receipt

Regarding the supply of the two daily necessities, oil and sugar, solutions have been found. Oil has been transported from Pudong to Shanghai and will be sold today. Restrictions on sugar purchases have also been relaxed. Details are as follows:

Cooking Oil

The Shanghai Cooking Oil Industry Wholesale Office has already allocated 5,500 dan out of the 10,000 dan of cooking oil ordered last month. The remaining 4,500 dan were recently loaded at the Pudong warehouse and transported to Shanghai for distribution to various retail oil stores. It was originally planned to be sold by various oil stores yesterday, but because the procedures could not be completed immediately, permission was granted to continue retail sales today.

Soybean Oil and Rapeseed Oil Sold Simultaneously

The method remains the same, with each person limited to half a jin per day. The cooking oil allocated to each oil store must be completely sold out according to the daily sales quantity. In order to prevent retailers from cheating, the office will merge more than 800 retail stores with daily sales volume of more than one dan into more than 300, and send personnel to supervise the sales separately. As for smaller retail stores, an inspection system will be adopted. Citizens are encouraged to report any violations. The oil sold this time is divided into two types: soybean oil and rapeseed oil. Soybean oil sells for 3.6 yuan per half jin, and rapeseed oil sells for 3.1 yuan.

Sugar

In order to maintain the supply of sugar in Shanghai, the Sugar Merchants Cooperative Business Office is making every effort to smooth the sugar supply channels. In addition to the more than 60,000 bags of sugar that have already arrived in Shanghai, 500,000 bags of Philippine sugar and sugar stored in Hong Kong have been agreed upon to be transported to Shanghai in batches for supply. The sugar allocation to Class A retail merchants and Class B users will be increased to maintain the legitimate needs of the market. The method for retailers to obtain sugar for sale has been improved, the sales volume has been increased, and it is stipulated that purchasers should distribute it to the attached households in their residences. This will be implemented starting today. The announcement is recorded as follows: "It has been found that in addition to the purchase of sugar with citizen certificates still following the original regulations, regarding the purchase of sugar with housing tax receipts, this office has formulated that it should be distributed based on the number of people in the entire household, naturally including attached households (i.e., three-room tenants). Now that the second phase has begun, in order to popularize the use of sugar for food households, this office will stipulate the following methods starting from the 11th of this month:"

Sugar Purchase Method Based on Housing Tax Receipt

(1) The housing tax receipts used by food households to purchase sugar are stipulated on the left and will be stamped with a triangular stamp by the sales supervisor on the blank corner of the receipts at the time of purchase to avoid duplication. A. Those residing in the International Settlement and the Hongkou and West Shanghai areas will still use the current autumn housing tax receipt. B. Those residing in the French Concession will still use the September-October housing tax receipt. C. Those residing in Zhabei will still use the autumn housing tax receipt. Those without housing tax receipts may use household registration certificates. D. This period is limited to purchasing sugar from the second phase. Those who did not purchase sugar from the first phase will not be allowed to purchase it retroactively.

Each Household Can Purchase 40 Yuan Worth of Sugar

(2) With the above housing tax receipts, each food household can purchase sugar up to 40 yuan in Central Reserve Bank notes. For the convenience of packaging and carrying, each store is allowed to divide it into four packages of 10 yuan each (including 2% retail tax). Each package contains 2.4 jin of white sugar or 2.6 jin of brown sugar. However, those in Zhabei who purchase with household registration certificates are still limited to 5 yuan per household registration certificate, equivalent to 1.2 jin of white sugar or 1.3 jin of brown sugar.

Purchased Sugar Should Be Evenly Distributed

(3) If there are attached households in the household of the person who purchased the sugar with the housing tax receipt, it should be distributed fairly and evenly according to the number of households. There should be no taking advantage. If there is a refusal to distribute fairly, the attached households (i.e., three-room tenants) are allowed to report to this office (23 Tongyun Street, French Concession, telephone 83300) or to the nearby authorities for investigation.

Retail Stores Sales Volume

(4) Stores that sell sugar with housing tax receipts have already been designated by this office as either "selling sugar every day" or "selling sugar every other day" based on the amount allocated. Each store should clearly mark "This store sells sugar every day," "This store sells sugar every other day," or "This store sells sugar on odd days" on the storefront for identification. Those selling sugar every day will still sell one-thirtieth of the total amount allocated to them. Those selling sugar every other day will sell one-fifteenth of the total amount allocated to them each time.

### Silver and Money Businesses Remit Deposit Reserves: Determined and Paid Based on Month-End Balance

The Silver and Money Industry Association issued a notice to its member banks and money houses: "Dear Sirs/Madams, According to Article 6 of the Provisional Measures for the Management of Financial Institutions by the Ministry of Finance, 'Financial institutions shall deposit the reserve for payment deposits into the Central Reserve Bank in accordance with regulations.' Also, according to Article 1 of the Detailed Rules for the Implementation of the Provisional Measures for the Management of Financial Institutions, financial institutions shall deposit their payment reserves in the reserve account opened at the Central Reserve Bank in accordance with the following regulations. The amount of fixed deposits and special current deposits shall be more than 5%. The payment deposit reserves for the various deposits mentioned above shall be determined according to the closing balance at the end of each month and shall be made before the end of each month. All member banks and money houses shall comply with this regulation. This notice is specially issued, and it is hoped that all banks and money houses will comply accordingly."

### The Shanghai Municipal Council Mark Will Soon Be Changed

The current Shanghai Municipal Council mark and armband were created in 1870. However, according to the results of the Shanghai Municipal Council meeting the other night, the style will be changed and will soon be announced and implemented. Manpower vehicles in Nanshi are allowed to enter the French Concession. After manpower vehicles from the Public Concession and the French Concession successively entered Nanshi, the traffic between the concessions and Nanshi has become more convenient, which directly and indirectly helps the prosperity of Nanshi. It is learned that vehicles in Nanshi have now been approved by the French Municipal Council and, after obtaining vehicle licenses, are allowed to enter the concession. Therefore, a large number of manpower vehicles from Nanshi have already entered the entire French Concession in recent days.

### Shanghai Materials Control Committee Reorganized: New Commodity Price Countermeasures Determined: Implemented in Conjunction with Established Currency Policy: All Industrial and Commercial Organizations Ordered to Implement

The Municipal Government recently received an order from the Executive Yuan to promulgate the Organizational Regulations of the Central Commodity Price Countermeasures Committee and the draft Organizational Rules of the Local Commodity Price Countermeasures Committee. Considering that the existing Shanghai Materials Control Committee is no longer suitable, a special order was issued to reorganize it in accordance with the Organizational Rules of the Local Commodity Price Countermeasures Committee and to determine the basic guidelines for commodity price management countermeasures as follows:

Establish the Foundation of Reserve Currency Control

(1) Commodity price management countermeasures should be implemented in conjunction with the promotion of the new currency system policy. The main purpose is to seek reasonable material allocation management and maintain fair and stable commodity prices in order to stabilize people's livelihoods and increase production. (2) In the New Legal Tender circulation area, in accordance with the established policy of promoting the new currency system, efforts should be made to break the liberalism of the old legal tender and actively establish the controlled economic foundation of the new legal tender so that currency policy and commodity price countermeasures complement each other to form a stable core for commodity prices. (3) In order to stabilize people's livelihoods, it is appropriate to implement a considerable low-price policy. At the same time, in order to prevent materials from flowing to different areas with higher commodity prices, in addition to the necessary military measures, special economic blockade methods should be sought.

All Industrial and Commercial Organizations Should Implement

(4) Commodity price countermeasures, with the maintenance of fair prices as the central task, should consider the actual situation in all aspects at any time to maintain fair and stable commodity prices. It is not appropriate to adhere to a fixed low-price policy, which will hinder the smooth flow of materials, encourage the accumulation of hoarding, and even promote the flow of materials to different areas. (5) What should be especially considered in commodity price countermeasures is that the source of materials that have always relied on overseas imports has been cut off. Therefore, we should actively strive to increase production to replace them, and the increase in the production of daily necessities is especially necessary. At the same time, we should thoroughly implement the protection of resources and the conservation of consumption. (6) Commodity price management countermeasures should adopt a key-point approach and gradually promote them. The implementation area should start with major cities. The implementation of materials should be carried out step by step in a practical manner for daily necessities, military supplies, export products, and important materials related to resource development. The objects of management and guidance should be all industrial and commercial organizations.

### Ineffective Mediation of Rent Leads to Water Shutoff - Landlord Unable to Cover Costs - Tenants Oppose Rent Increase

Houses numbered 66 to 76 on Beiling De Si Road (newly built at the intersection of Rue Petain and Avenue Joffre) originally had a monthly rent of 60 yuan per unit. However, due to the landlord's inability to cover expenses, they requested a rent increase from the sub-landlords, which was refused. Consequently, the landlord appealed to the French authorities for mediation. However, the sub-landlords in that area adopted a non-cooperative attitude, forcing the French Municipal Council to suspend water supply starting from the 9th as a warning.

Mediation Failure

It is reported that the rent issue in that area was investigated by the French authorities several months ago. The investigation revealed that the landlord was not only unable to profit but was also incurring losses due to high water costs. The tenants' monthly rent of 60 yuan was disproportionately low compared to the value of the 70,000 yuan properties they occupied. Therefore, after research by the French police, it was suggested that the rent per house should be calculated based on the number of occupants, with an increase of 1.30 yuan per person. However, this proposal was rejected by all tenants (most of whom are wealthy Chinese merchants).

Water Shutoff Warning

The landlord stated that they could no longer afford the high water costs and requested another investigation by the French authorities, stating that they were unwilling to continue incurring monthly losses. Finally, with the assistance of the French authorities, the water supply to the tenants was cut off yesterday to urge them to increase the rent slightly or bear the water costs themselves. According to an official from the French Concession's Rent Mediation Committee, the authorities' strict action was a warning to those who disobey reasonable mediation.

### Shanghai Qingxiang Branch Orders the Holding of Township and Baojia Training

The Shanghai Qingxiang Branch ordered the holding of township and baojia training. To further strengthen the baojia system, the Shanghai Qingxiang Branch, in addition to the training for township and baojia heads during the Qingxiang campaign, has scheduled another training session from December 20th to December 25th. The Qingxiang Area Offices and Special District Administrations are ordered to implement the township and baojia head training again, aiming to achieve the desired results. It is expected that the baojia system in the Qingxiang area will become even more sound.

### The Chinese Woodcut Artists Association Issues a Second Call for Submissions

And Publishes the "Chinese Woodcut" Monthly Magazine Since its establishment two months ago, the Chinese Woodcut Artists Association has achieved considerable success. It is learned that the association is now issuing a second call for members to popularize woodcut art throughout the country (the charter will be sent upon request). It also publishes a monthly magazine called "Chinese Woodcut," which is known for its exquisite content. The main articles in the inaugural issue include "Chinese Youth and Printmaking" (Zhongshan Yisan), "The Future of Chinese Woodcut" (Luoshen), "Woodcut Lectures" (Wang Yingxiao), "Woodcut Aphorisms" (Takawa Ken), and multiple woodcut masterpieces. It is said to be available for sale from today, priced at 1.40 yuan per copy. Those who love woodcut art can purchase it directly from the association at No. 308 Henan Road, Shanghai, and a copy will be sent to them.

### Alert and Control Measures Already in Place - Baojia Should Pay Attention to the Following Points - Curtains Should be Wider Than Windows - Lookout Towers Should Be Aware of Objects Dropped

The baojia offices in all districts of the Public Concession have received an urgent notice from the police station announcing a state of alert and control from today. The General Baojia of the Zhabei District has also notified all Lianbao (joint baojia) to inform their respective baojia heads to pay special attention to seven key points to ensure thorough control.

Cover Skylights

(1) During the last drill, most of the curtains in each household were substandard and should be at least one foot wider than the window on each side to prevent light from escaping. (2) Many rooms have skylights that are not covered. Failure to cover skylights negates the effectiveness of other window coverings. Strict attention should be paid to this. (3) Large buildings such as hotels and department stores have many windows, making management difficult. These buildings must be divided into smaller areas, each assigned to a person responsible for covering the windows or turning off the lights upon hearing an alert to prevent chaos. (4) After the street lights are dimmed, only a few newly installed air-raid lights should be left on in the alleys. The minimum number of lights needed should be determined in advance and reported to the General Baojia, which will then inform the police station for approval.

Lookout Points

(5) During air-raid drills, announcements are broadcast by radio stations, so each baojia office must have a radio (borrowed from residents if not purchased) to receive orders and relay them to the jia heads and residents. (6) During the previous air-raid drill, one model bao was established in each Lianbao. Two more model bao must be established quickly in addition to the existing one. (7) The method for establishing lookout towers was explained in the previously issued Provisional Guidelines for Air Raid Lighting Control. Previously, the focus was on covering the lights in each household, but now, attention must also be paid to the bomb proxies dropped from the aircraft during the air-raid drill. The total number of items must be identified, the location of each noted, and retrieved as possible.

### The Japanese Authorities in Shanghai Hold a Commemorative Tea Party

### Tight Monetary Policy Remains - Chinese Stocks Fall Across the Board

The Chinese stock market experienced a widespread decline yesterday due to the continued tight monetary policy. The recent surge in prices prompted many to sell and cash out, intensifying the downward trend. Despite activity from new and old investors, the momentum has waned. The approaching Lunar New Year is also a factor in the decline. The outlook is unlikely to improve easily. The decline was most pronounced in the public utilities sector, with Chinese stocks once falling to the 40 yuan level. Zhabei Water and Electricity fell by 2.5 yuan. The textile industry also suffered a setback due to falling yarn prices. Wing On Textiles fell by nearly 40 yuan. Dasheng Mills Nos. 1 and 3 saw selling pressure and bucked the trend, maintaining strength. Small-denomination stocks also softened again. The department store sector was quiet, with Xinhua stocks trading flat. Xinhua new shares plunged by 6 yuan. The Great China Match also rebounded slightly by 2.5 yuan. Nanyang Tobacco plunged by 4 yuan, falling below 130 yuan. Huacheng Tobacco was at 355 yuan. In the new pharmaceutical sector, only Five Continents Pharmacy rose by 5 yuan, while most others retreated. Xinyi fell below 300 yuan. Minyi fell by 6 yuan to nearly 90 yuan. Zhongfa fell by 0.25 yuan. Xinya fell by 2 yuan. The transaction price for Guohua Bank was between 160 and 170 yuan. Meilin Food had buyers at 1,100 yuan. In the cultural sector, Zhonghua alone rose by 2.5 yuan, while Commerce and World both declined. Trading was weak. The market price list for today is recorded below.

### Government Bond Prices Fall

Although there has been no market for government bonds recently, prices have fluctuated from time to time, but these are not standard prices, as only a very small number of people are doing spot transactions. Therefore, market prices vary greatly from place to place and from building to building. The highest price traded within the day was slightly over 60 yuan, and the lowest was 55 yuan. Yesterday's price was around 57 or 58 yuan, not far from the ceiling price of 50 yuan.

### There is Little Demand for Gold Ornaments

Yesterday, the gold ornament retail price at the Dahsin Gold Shop and other shops in the city was 3,350 yuan per tael, unchanged. The buy-back price was reduced by about 300 yuan. The price difference was significant, indicating a further decline in the unofficial market price among traders. The price opened at 3,270 yuan in the morning, down 40 yuan. The situation was characterized by little demand. By noon, it was difficult to sell even at 3,200 yuan, a difference of 1,100 yuan from the previous day. Transaction volume was low. The price of silver ornaments remained at 16 yuan per tael, with traders buying and selling at 18.5 and 19 yuan, respectively. The money changers' association interest rate remained unchanged at 1.4 fen.

Military scrip remained stable and firm. The inter-dealer price was 5 yuan, 5 jiao, 5 fen, 3 li and 5 hao. The retail selling price at banks and small money changers remained at 5 yuan, 5 jiao, 6 fen, with the buy-back price also rising to 5 fen.

### The Cloth Industry is Busy with Registration, With Very Few Transactions

Factory Cloth Yesterday, the cloth market saw little trading as traders were busy registering inventory. Sellers continued to release stock, causing the market to soften. 16-pound Earth brand coarse cloth was 253 yuan, 14-pound Earth brand was 222 yuan, 9-pound Xinhua brand was 138 yuan, and 8-pound Zhenzhong brand was 135 yuan. In the morning market, 12-pound Earth brand fine cloth traded at 188.75 yuan, and later traded at 188 yuan. The price of Dapeng Fine Cloth also needed to be between 188 yuan and 9 yuan. The price of peach-colored ladies' poplin fell to as low as 295 yuan, closing at 302 yuan at noon. In the afternoon, the price rebounded to 306.5 yuan due to the excessive decline.

Eastern Cloth Yesterday, the downward trend continued. 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth new orders were 191 yuan, and bank orders were 192.75 yuan, a further decline of 0.25 to 0.5 yuan per bolt. Colorful Ball was 193.25 yuan, Flying Fish was 191.5 yuan, Yang Crane was 191 yuan, Trumpet was 191 yuan, and Five Blessings was 190.5 yuan. Mid-range brands remained relatively stable. However, the Four Gentlemen beaverteen red order had too many floating quantities from retail customers, causing it to decline despite attempts to increase the price. The final price traded at 7.63 yuan, a decline of 7 fen.

### Dried Persimmons Suddenly Surge in Price in Beijing

Dried persimmons prices have suddenly increased in Beijing to 350 yuan, climbing by 40 to 50 yuan due to rising production costs. This has caused Shanghai merchants to keep to their stock.

### Sunflower Seeds Become More Active

Sunflower seeds were initially loose in Shanghai because the production price was more appropriate in Shanghai. However, as sales became more active, the market tightened. Yesterday, the price was 450 yuan. Black melon seeds were quiet and inactive. Although merchants called for higher prices, there was little demand.

### Daily Necessities Rise Sharply

The Guild Forbids Non-Industry People from Entering the Market Recently, the prices of cigarettes, matches, and soap have risen sharply. The guild, concerned about the endless rise in prices and its impact on the livelihoods of ordinary people, has banned non-industry people from entering the market since yesterday. However, common merchants still buy and sell outside the market, and prices remain high. The price of the Da Yang brand is 9,400 yuan, the Lao Dao brand is 8,400 yuan, the Pinghai brand is 8,300 yuan, the Xiannv brand is 7,500 yuan, and the Wuhua brand is 6,600 yuan. Japanese Jin Qiang brand cigarettes are 3,100 yuan, Jin Dalou brand is 3,550 yuan, Zhinan brand is 2,450 yuan to 2,500 yuan, Quanlu brand is 3,150 yuan, and Guoyan Jinzita brand is 6,400 yuan. The prices of daily necessities are Beautiful brand matches 3,500 yuan, Phoenix brand 3,400 yuan, Guben soap 540 yuan, Baixiangmao soap 485 yuan, Huangxiangmao soap 495 yuan, Scissors soap 500 yuan, and White Rice foreign candles 380 yuan, all with varying degrees of firm increases.

### New and Old Steel Plate Transactions are Both Clear

There is extraordinarily minimal transactions of steel plates, 2.5-cent to 7.5-cent plates and old oil-pool plates. Shipyards and ironworks are hardly drawing down. The steel market has dropped off into depression. Yesterday's price for 2.5 to 7.5-cent plates was 20,000 per ton and thin patterned plates was 18,000 yuan per ton (due to the potential for supplies to run out). Old steel from oil ponds was 14,000 yuan per ton. 2,000 lb black billets were 16,000 yuan per bundle.

### Thoughts on "Jiang Zhou Weep Blood Record"

(1)
— Mei Bo

"Jiang Zhou Weep Blood Record" was originally called "Roar, China!". It is said that it has been performed twice in Shanghai before, but unfortunately, I didn't have the opportunity to attend, so I can't compare the impressions of the two. This time, it emphasizes the anti-British and American aspect, and it seems that many contents have been deleted. Some scenes are therefore inevitably monotonous. For example, in the second scene of the first act, the American Aslai quarrels with the boatman and even drowns. The whole conversation is only five or six sentences, and the performance is at most five minutes. It stands to reason that it would be enough for the captain (played by Yan Jun) to say a word, but now it is made into an independent scene, which seems too uneconomical. Maybe that's how the original work was; that would be the original author's negligence.

Looking at the whole play, I think the first and second acts are better than the other two acts. Maybe this is my preference. I always think that an artistic work, rather than inserting many speeches, would rather appeal to the audience's intuition, move their hearts, and make them completely intoxicated by the work. For example, in the first act, there are many satirical dialogues, which are very clever. The audience will often smile knowingly when they hear it. The dialogue of several boatmen in the third act is intimate and humane, and it is also worthy of our careful aftertaste.

In terms of directing, Mr. Li Pingyi has put in a lot of effort, but I think it's a bit "poor" for movie stars to perform dramas. An obvious fact is that among the stars who participated in this performance, those who took drama as their "mother's home" generally performed better than the real old stars. Doesn't this just illustrate the particularity of drama?

As for the individual acting skills of the actors, I especially like Yan Jun's captain. Yan Jun's lines are extremely intonated, enough to express the captain's invincible power. Lu Shan's lines are also very smooth, but unfortunately, there are not many scenes. Zhang Wan, who plays the wife of Boatman B, always grasped the consistent emotions, which is commendable. Xu Li's old boatman is not tepid and stops at the right time, which seems to be better than the one who played the old man (I didn't see Jiang Ming). The most inexplicable character on the cast list is Lao Fei. It seems that it is difficult to find such a knowledgeable boatman in the reality of China. As for the Taoist Yin (seems to be Zhou Wenbin that day?), the Huang translator, the characters are not as prominent as the previous ones, so I will not discuss them here. Unmanned

"Jiang Zhou Weep Blood Record" is adapted by Xiao Ping based on the original "Roar, China!" by the Soviet futurist poet Cui Lai Tai Jiaofu, directed by Li Pingqian. The whole play has four acts. The first act is a warship, the second act is the Taoist Yin's office, the third act is the boatman's association, and the fourth act is the cemetery and execution ground. The performers, in addition to Lu _, are mostly actors from "Zhonglian".

The story took place in Wanxian in June 1924. Because of a boatman, Ji Changxing, a quarrel unfortunately capsized the sampan and drowned the poor American gentleman, Ah Kanlai, who did not know how to swim. So, the _ _ people put forward an "ultimatum" and demanded that the Chinese authorities accept four harsh conditions. One of the conditions was: Two innocent boatmen must be executed without legal trial.

I remember in the autumn of September 22, I watched the "Roar, China!" performed by the Shanghai Drama Association at the Golden Grand Theater, directed by Ying Yunwei. The cast was tight and strong, and the quality of the script was sound, so I was very satisfied. At that time, I was only sixteen years old, and my emotions were overflowing. For the last scene of the play, the execution of two boatmen, I almost really cried in the theater!

This time, I watched "Jiang Zhou Weep Blood Record" again. Ten years have passed. In the past ten years, I have groped in the struggle of being oppressed, I have struggled in a painful environment, and I remember "Roar, China!".

From the first act to the fourth act, I was always surrounded by serious emotions. Here, there is blood, there are tears, and there is a young man's jumping heart.

The directing technique is quite easy. In terms of actors, Jiang Ming's Lao Fei and Yan Jun's Captain are the most successful. Jiang Ming's dialogue with Daoyin in the second act is truly "tearful", and Yan Jun's consistent foreign-style arrogance vividly portrays the outlines, personality, and actions of foreigners. Others such as Lu Yuzhi's boatman, Xu Li's old boatman, Gu Yelu's Huang translator, Zhang Wan's boatman's wife, Zhou Weibin's Daoyin, and Lu Shan's captain's wife can also be in line with their identities and are very stable. Hong Jingling, Qin Tong, Zhou Qi, Xu Xinyuan, Cang Yinqiu, Guan Hongda, Han Langen, Zhang Zhizhi, Chen Qi, etc., did not have many scenes and did not perform well.

The sets and props are exquisite. The waves in the second scene of the first act and the floating clouds in the third act are very cleverly lit, and the effect is very good. For example, the sound of the wind, the sound of throwing anchors, and the sound of dogs barking are all like the real thing.

"Jiang Zhou Weep Blood Record" is a special harvest for the drama circle this year.

### Chen Dawei Goes to the Old Capital

Young actor Chen Dawei performed in the Tianchan Theater last month and made his debut. His reputation was good, and the media regarded him as a prodigy in the Peking Opera world. Since the performance at Tianchan ended, his friends Hu Guoqiao, Lou Longhou, and Ping Opera artists Su Shaoqing, _ Huaguanzhu, Zheng Guoyi, and Fan Shi Ren have all advocated that Chen should go north to observe, learn from teachers and discuss, in order to further his studies. It is reported that Chen has decided to leave Shanghai for the old capital on the 11th of this month to specialize in Peking Opera, learn from teachers, and sing. He plans to form a troupe and return to the south in a year to meet with the people of Shanghai again. With Chen's talent and perseverance, he will surely shine in the Peking Opera world in the future. On the 6th of this month, the Aurora University Winter Clothing Solicitation Committee held a charity Peking Opera concert, and Chen was invited to perform the play "Battle of Taiping" as a farewell memorial. The colleagues of this newspaper set up a banquet for Chen to bid him farewell and strengthen his courage. It is said that the famous amateur actor Fan Shiren will accompany Chen to the north.

### Desires After the Resumption of Publication of Shen Bao

— Huang Jingwan

I have lived in Shanghai for forty-nine years. I have always loved reading newspapers and books. After work, I would always bring a newspaper back home to read carefully in the quiet of the night. After reading, I would classify and clip them, and I have done this every day for thirty years without interruption. Later, due to the war and environmental factors, they were all lost in fires, which I find very regrettable. Shanghai Daily's Shen Bao was the earliest newspaper. I have been friends with it for more than thirty years, and the benefits I have gained from it are countless. Therefore, Shen Bao is nothing less than my good teacher and helpful friend. Now that it has resumed publication, I am both celebrating the return of my good teacher and helpful friend to my side and briefly outlining my hopes, hoping that we can encourage each other.

(1) To take the establishment of equal personal rights as the principle, promote genuine friendship between China and Japan, and fulfill the mission of restoring culture.

(2) To study the way of peace in order to stabilize the lives of the entire population of Shanghai.

(3) To promote the inherent culture of the East and serve as the center of Asian culture.

(4) As the most historical newspaper of the current era, Zhong Bao should seize the opportunity to fulfill its duty of publicity.

(5) All members of the company should be united, friendly, and cooperative, jointly seeking the development of the newspaper industry and promoting the welfare of the people.

(6) To temper each person's mind and body and practice the New Life Movement.

### Sharing the Same Boat in Storms

— He Jia Zhi

(2) The Enemy

Huang Long thanked him. The father asked Wang Shun where he was. The helper pointed and said, "It's just ahead. There's a glass lamp at the door with red characters written on the glass. A big character 'Wang', and the two smaller characters 'Shun Xing'. Do you recognize the characters?" Wei Cheng said from behind, "I recognize the characters. Okay, we'll go ourselves, thank you." Wei Cheng said and walked ahead of Huang Long. The shops on both sides of the street were closing, blocking the meager lamplight from the doorways with their doors. The two stumbled past, one foot high, one foot low, until they reached the crossroads. Huang Long raised his hand and slapped his head. Wei Cheng turned around and asked, "What are you doing?" Huang Long said, "What Wang Shun Xing, Li Shun Xing, it's actually Wang Crazy's teahouse, I remember now. Turn north, I recognize it." Huang Long rushed ahead of Wei Cheng, turned the corner, and laughed, "It's just ahead, no need to look at the characters on the lamp anymore. I've fought here before." He walked a few steps past, and Wei Cheng still looked up to take a look. Sure enough, there was a lamp, but it wasn't lit, and it was impossible to tell what was written on it. He walked in from a threshold where half of a table was under the eaves and half of the table was inside. He suddenly realized that the facade of this Wang Shun Xing Inn was a teahouse, and the inside of Wang Crazy's teahouse was the Wang Shun Xing Inn.

Huang Long was in front, walking under the dim wall lamp, leading Wei Cheng into a glass door. The glass was very bright, so bright that you could see thirteen or fourteen plasters plastered all over the cracks. Huang Long nodded to the person inside the door. An old man sitting at the counter came to greet them. Huang Long said, "We want a room, any number of beds will do." The old man said, "Yes, yes, yes." He led them to a room behind a screen. Huang Long said, "Where's the lamp?" The old man said, "Coming, coming, don't be in a hurry, guests. Where are you from?" Huang Long said, "We were gambling during the day, we came from the gambling place." The lamp came, illuminating the room, which had only two beds. Huang Long went to push open two short windows to take a look. It was a narrow alley, and the lamplight reflected onto the wall outside the window. Wei Cheng kept saying, "Very good, very good, are you the owner? We'll go get dinner and come back." The old man laughed and said, "Yes, I'm Wang Crazy, but I'm not crazy at all. That's what people call me, so that's what I answer to. If the guests are going out for dinner, don't worry about not finding a place to eat." (239)

### Memoirs of the Defeat in Malaya （）

— Lieutenant General Percival's Memoirs

Memoirs of Lieutenant General Percival, Former Commander of the British Army in Malaya

The campaign to capture Malaya and Singapore was our first objective in the Greater East Asia War and also the greatest achievement of the year. After the fall of Singapore, Britain began the first step in a complete retreat in East Asia, and we also took the first step towards a brilliant victory. Before the war, the United Kingdom and the United States regarded this as one of their strongholds and boasted that the defense was very complete. However, before long after the declaration of war, my brave soldiers had completed the desperate "landing in front of the enemy" on the east coast of the Malay Peninsula, such as Singora and Kota Bharu; furthermore, in Slim, Jitra, and Kukup, they continued to repel the stubborn resistance of the enemy, regardless of the severe heat. Or they went deep into the untouched wilderness forests. The 1,100-kilometer distance to Singapore (which is the same distance between Tokyo and Shimonoseki) was breached in a short period of only fifty-five days. The advance was like a hot knife through butter, and the historic capture of the fortress, including the siege of Singapore, was completed in seventy days! It has been exactly one year since the war began. Lieutenant General A.B. Percival, the surrendered commander of the British Army in Malaya, published the following full text of "Memoirs of the Malayan Campaign" as a prisoner of war in a certain location. As Percival said, "The defense of my car has reached the ultimate state of perfection." In this impregnable British position, my loyal generals actually completed the landing operation. This article describes this point vividly, which is worthy of our attention. In addition, the fierce fighting of the Tobi unit in the Kota Bharu area, the "breakthrough" of the Saeki and other units on the Jitra line on the Kedah line, and the gradual defeat of the enemy forces after the naval mobile units and air force attacked the most stubbornly resistant northern part of Kukup area were all vividly described in this article. This path of the enemy's retreat is the scroll of our victory. Looking back on the past, we must strengthen our determination to destroy Britain and the United States.
