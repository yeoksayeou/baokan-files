### Large-Scale Naval Battle Occurs in Coral Sea East of Australia; Japanese Headquarters Announces Yesterday Afternoon That Three British and American Warships Were Sunk and Two Were Severely Damaged

Tokyo, 8th (Domei News Agency): According to the Japanese Naval Press Section, the Japanese Navy discovered a joint British and American fleet in the Coral Sea east of Australia yesterday and immediately attacked it with great success. Further battle results will be reported today.

Tokyo, 8th (Domei News Agency): A dispatch from the Japanese Imperial Headquarters at 5:20 PM today announced that Japanese warships operating in the New Guinea area engaged with a joint British and American fleet yesterday and today, achieving a tremendous victory, sinking one American battleship and two aircraft carriers, and severely damaging one British battleship and one cruiser. The American battleship belongs to the 32,600-ton California class, and the aircraft carriers belong to the 33,000-ton Saratoga class and the 19,900-ton Yorktown class. The damaged British battleship is of the 30,000-ton Warspite type, and the cruiser is of the 10,000-ton Canberra type. The battle is still ongoing and will be named the "Battle of the Coral Sea." The contents of the announcement are as follows: "Japanese warships operating in the New Guinea area discovered a powerful joint British and American fleet in the Coral Sea southeast of New Guinea on May 6th. They launched an attack yesterday, immediately sinking one American California-class battleship, severely damaging one British Canberra-class heavy cruiser and one British Warspite-class battleship. Furthermore, today they sank one American Saratoga-class and one Yorktown-class aircraft carrier each."

Lisbon, 8th (Domei News Agency): A broadcast from an Australian radio station reporting that the U.S. Navy Department announced on Friday, "The U.S. Navy engaged the Japanese forces outside the Solomon Islands on May 4th, achieving a great victory," has aroused suspicion among neutral observers here. The announcement stated that Japanese losses included one light cruiser, two destroyers, four gunboats, and one supply ship sunk; one 9,000-ton seaplane tender, one light cruiser, and one cargo ship damaged; and six seaplanes destroyed. According to observers, they do not consider the aforementioned battle results as a "fairly successful announcement," because even if this news is true, the damage to the Japanese fleet only includes two light cruisers and no more powerful ships, and it cannot be called a great victory.

Canberra, 8th (Reuters): Australian Prime Minister Curtin recently stated in the House of Representatives in a solemn tone that the ongoing naval and air battles in the Southwest Pacific are extremely important in the entire war in this theater. No one can currently determine the outcome of this major battle.

Melbourne, 8th (Reuters): The Allied Headquarters in the Southwest Pacific announced today that Japanese fighters attacked the airfield at Port Moresby, New Guinea, yesterday.

### Details of British-German Naval Battle in the Arctic Ocean; British Ship "Edinburgh" Sunk; Supplies for the Soviet Union Still Arrive Safely at Destination

London, 7th (Havas News Agency): The Admiralty issued a statement this month describing the naval battle currently taking place in the Arctic Ocean and announcing that the latest British cruiser, the "Edinburgh," had been sunk. The full text is as follows: "Recently, there were two convoys, one carrying munitions to the Soviet Union, and the other returning westward from a Soviet port. While sailing through the Arctic Ocean, they were repeatedly attacked by enemy warships, aircraft, and submarines for several days. Although we suffered significant losses, the convoy heading to the Soviet Union was able to safely reach its destination. Only one ship was sunk in the convoy returning to the home country, and it was an empty ship. On the contrary, the enemy suffered heavy losses. First, on the afternoon of April 30th, the British cruiser "Edinburgh" (Captain Faulkner) was escorting a convoy back home when it was suddenly hit by a torpedo from an enemy submarine. The ship's stern suffered heavy damage, but after reducing speed, it was able to continue sailing as usual. On the afternoon of May 1st, the convoy was again attacked by three German destroyers, but all attacks failed. However, one British merchant ship was sunk, and the warships escorting the merchant ships suffered some casualties, with seven sailors killed. On the morning of the 2nd, the "Edinburgh" and the escorting destroyers were again attacked by German warships. At that time, due to bad weather and poor visibility, the "Edinburgh" was unable to sail and was hit by a torpedo, sinking immediately. However, at the same time, one enemy ship was also sunk, and another was severely damaged. Since then, the convoy returning to the home country has not been attacked again. As for the other convoy heading to the Soviet Union, it was also attacked by two German destroyers on the afternoon of May 1st, and then attacked by six "Junkers" 88 dive bombers. We had no casualties or losses, and one enemy plane was shot down. By the afternoon of May 2nd, it was attacked by six aircraft again, and three merchant ships were sunk. At least one more enemy plane was shot down. By the next day, this convoy was bombed by enemy planes again, with only one merchant ship slightly damaged, and one enemy plane was also shot down. Since then, the convoy has not been attacked again and finally safely reached a Soviet port. The cruiser "Edinburgh" has a displacement of 10,000 tons and was commissioned into the fleet in February 1938. It is equipped with twelve 6-inch guns, twelve 4-inch anti-aircraft guns, sixteen smaller guns, and six torpedo tubes, and carries six aircraft. In November 1941, the officers and soldiers of the ship were awarded medals for their meritorious service in the Mediterranean."

### Fighting Still Ongoing on Mindanao Island; 10,000 Soldiers and Civilians Captured in Battle of Corregidor

Japanese Headquarters, Somewhere, 8th (Domei News Agency): One route of the Japanese army that landed at Macajalar Bay on Mindanao Island, and another route of the Japanese army that advanced north after occupying Dansalan and occupied the Iligan airfield on Tuesday, made contact on Wednesday afternoon in Banisilan (northwest of Cagayan). The mopping-up operation in the western part of Mindanao Island was thus successfully concluded. At the same time, a Japanese army unit that landed near Cagayan on Sunday attacked southeast, and has already penetrated the key points of Talomo and Agusan southeast of Cagayan. When the Japanese army was fighting near Talomo, they seized six aircraft, one tank, six trucks, forty heavy machine guns, and 300 horses.

Washington, 7th (Reuters): The War Department issued a statement this morning stating that a total of 11,574 soldiers, sailors, and civilians were captured when Corregidor and other fortresses in Manila Bay in the Philippines were captured by the Japanese army. This figure is based on a report from April 5th. If the deaths and injuries before the 15th are deducted, the actual number of personnel should be less than this number. Among the above-mentioned personnel, 2,274 were naval personnel and 3,730 were American and Filipino soldiers. Since the 6th of this month, no news has been received from the Philippines, and the soldiers and civilians in each fortress are feared to have become prisoners. The Japanese side has stated that it is willing to treat prisoners in accordance with the Geneva Convention.

Washington, 7th (Reuters): Undersecretary of the Army Patterson stated at a press conference today that the defense of Corregidor and the Bataan Peninsula will be one of the most glorious pages in American history and can be compared to the defense of Charleston in the Revolutionary War of 1780. The forced cessation of hostilities on Corregidor seems to have been caused by the fierce artillery fire of the Japanese army, as continuous attacks have destroyed all defensive fortifications. The artillery fire may have been more effective than the Japanese air raids. Patterson also stated that General Wainwright may have become a prisoner of war along with other personnel.

### News from the Yunnan-Burma Front

Tokyo, 8th (Domei News Agency): The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 2:50 PM today that Japanese troops in Burma occupied Lashio on the 29th of last month and Bhamo on the 3rd of this month.

Budapest, 8th (Haitong News Agency): According to well-informed sources here, Hungary has very close relations with Brazil, and many Hungarian people have immigrated to Brazil and maintain close contact with their motherland. However, the Hungarian government decided to sever diplomatic relations with that country because of Brazil's anti-Axis stance. Minister to Brazil Horthy, the young son of the Hungarian Regent, has been assigned to the capital of Chile, or will be transferred to Portugal as Minister. Hungary has also severed diplomatic relations with Paraguay and Uruguay. Hungary does not have close relations with the two countries. Paraguay has an embassy in Hungary, and Uruguay has not sent a minister to Hungary. Hungary's interests in Paraguay and Uruguay are taken care of by the minister to Argentina.

### Situation on the Eastern Front

Berlin, 8th (Haitong News Agency): In the battles on the Eastern Front in recent days, the German army has continued to attack. German troops in the central sector have occupied many important mountainous strongholds, and the positions held by German troops in the central sector have become more stable. In one engagement, 600 enemy soldiers were captured, and 19 cannons, 26 trench mortars, 125 machine guns, and other munitions were seized. A group of Soviet troops surrounded by us in the central sector attempted to break through, but they were annihilated by us. The enemy army in the northern sector launched continuous attacks for three days, but they were unsuccessful. The fighting in the southern sector was relatively quiet. The claim by Daventry Radio that fierce battles were taking place between Poltava and Dnepropetrovsk is not worth denying, as there is no front line there, only the rear of the battle area.

Helsinki, 7th (Havas): The General Headquarters issued a battle report stating that the front lines in Karelia and Olonets Isthmuses are not very active. In the Ruuhi district, the German and Finnish forces have completely wiped out the Red Army's 238th Division, leaving no less than 1,500 corpses. Yesterday, the enemy army lost another 900 men.

### German Army Uses Special Aircraft on Eastern Front

Bern, Switzerland, 7th (Havas News Agency): The "Neue Zürcher Zeitung" quoted a correspondent in Berlin as saying that Germany is now using a type of "asymmetrical" aircraft. Its design involves equipping the right wing with weapons, placing machine guns and gun emplacements there, with the pilot on the side. The left wing is equipped with an engine. This design was drawn by Dr. Vogt and has been mass-produced at a very rapid rate. It is easy to fly and has strong lift and can be used for special purposes. However, its nature has not been announced. It is reported that it has been used on the Eastern Front with considerable success.

### Alaskan Highway (1)

Speaking of Alaska, one immediately thinks of the Yukon River. Speaking of this poetic river, it truly evokes a sense of longing and enchantment. It is not only poetic; broadly speaking, it is simply a treasure trove of stories. Whether one wishes to write poetry, novels, or screenplays, a visit to this river can provide boundless inspiration. Even the most uncouth person, upon arriving here, cannot help but feel an indescribable sentiment. As long as one follows this sentiment, uttering even a few disconnected and meaningless words in a rough and fragmented tone, it will still feel poetic; because everything here is too grand, yet too solitary, too desolate, too changeable, too perilous, too tragic; and at the same time, too beautiful, too real.

If you would like to hear a story about this place, I can share a recent incident to test the reader's emotions—

About two years ago, an eighty-four-year-old man lived alone not far from the Yukon River. Before the harsh winter arrived, he wanted to rush to town to purchase some necessary supplies. This area is not very far from the Arctic, and there are only two or three hours of daylight. How far can an eighty-plus-year-old man walk in two hours? By the time he reached a small stream branching off the Yukon, the sun had already set. Although there was still a faint afterglow, shimmering and shining, he did not want to risk crossing the stream. Although the banks of the stream were frozen, a trickle of cold spring water still flowed in the middle, heading towards the Yukon River. He planned to spend the night by the stream. In Alaska, knowing how to make a fire means knowing how to survive. He had experience and had already thought of this, so he hurriedly collected some branches and dry leaves. Who knew that in this icy and snowy place, as soon as the sun disappeared, the cold air would immediately penetrate the bones. Before he could start a fire, his beard and hair were already covered in a layer of ice, and the blood vessels in his limbs had already begun to freeze. Fire—impossible to start! At this time, the howling of wolves and the roaring of bears were gradually approaching. He thought that being eaten by wild beasts at such an old age was not worth it. He used his last strength to crawl towards the middle of the stream, quietly lying there, letting the trickle of cold spring water flow over his body. Several days later, the local search team arrived and found the old man's body completely encased in ice, as if sleeping in a pure crystal coffin.

That's what Alaska is like, that's the kind of place it is. Here, there are beautiful Arctic terns, flying tirelessly for more than 23,000 miles, spreading their wings from the Arctic until they stop in the Antarctic. Here, there are reindeer as tame as sheep, traveling in herds of hundreds or thousands, leisurely and content; they are not startled by people, but simply stand there, looking at you, their eyes blinking. Here, there are inexhaustible salmon; there are also swarms of mosquitoes, like dark clouds, flying back and forth. If you are not careful, you will be surrounded by them.

When gold was discovered in the Yukon territory of Canada in 1896, people flocked there like swarms of carp crossing a river. Some people went west along the Yukon River to Alaska. This was a famous gold rush scene from forty or fifty years ago, and Alaska, a remote corner of the earth, gradually became known to everyone, young and old.

It's hard to believe, but such a large piece of land, roughly 600,000 square miles (586,400 square miles), about one-fifth the size of the United States, located on the same continent as Canada, was unknown to Canadians. It wasn't considered part of the North American continent even after Spanish exploration, Russian exploration, and Mexican migration. It was only in 1728, when Danish explorer Bering discovered the Bering Strait, that this pristine land was noticed. Later, in 1741, during Bering's second expedition, everyone finally acknowledged his discovery of Alaska.

Especially amusing is that in 1859, American Senator Gwin proposed to purchase Alaska, but it was delayed by the Civil War. It wasn't until 1867 that Secretary of State Seward strongly advocated for it, and the deal was finally made for $7.2 million. After acquiring it, many prominent figures ridiculed the purchase, calling it buying an iceberg. Who would have thought that seventy years later, it would become a vital area for national defense!

Calling it an iceberg is somewhat accurate because the entire area is located north of 60 degrees latitude, in the Arctic Circle. And a small portion even extends into the Arctic Ocean, covered in ice and snow year-round. Isn't that an iceberg? But some areas can get quite hot in the summer.

Although the place is cold, the output is not bad: fish are the main product: sturgeon (i.e., turtles), salmon, generate an annual income of about forty to fifty million dollars; fur is also worth hundreds of thousands of dollars; gold, silver, and copper, by 1927, had already produced over six hundred million dollars in value; in the last ten years or so, production has increased annually; in addition, the timber from the vast forests is so vast that it's staggering to express it numerically.

Because of the cold, the population is not large, fluctuating around an average of 50,000 people. Most are white, and a small portion are natives, most of whom are Eskimos (i.e., Mongolian immigrants), and a small portion are local natives. There are also dozens of Japanese and dozens of Chinese.

During the gold rush, there were eighteen cities. Later, two cities declined, and the remaining sixteen cities averaged more than a thousand households each. These cities have churches, hospitals, schools, markets, and other facilities, albeit rudimentary.

The coastline of this area, including the islands, is over 26,000 miles long. This is because it is surrounded by the sea on three sides, and the number of islands, large and small, is countless; the Alexander Archipelago in the southeast alone has more than 1,100 islands. The most important is the Aleutian Islands; this group of islands extends southwest from the southwestern peninsula of Alaska, one after another, arranged in a chain, for more than 1,100 miles, forming an arc that reaches Kamchatka in Soviet Russia. Putting planks on these scattered islands could practically build a bridge between the Americas and Asia.

Whether it is an island or the mainland, the terrain in this area is very high. The Alexander Islands, for example, are all high mountains, rising 3,000 to 5,000 feet above sea level. As for the mainland, most of it is plateau, except for some low-lying areas along the rivers. The rest is mostly mountain range. The height of the mountains averages 5,000 to 6,000 feet above sea level. The most famous is Mount Logan, which is over 19,000 feet high. The highest peak is Mount McKinley, which is over 20,300 feet high, the highest peak in North America.

The most scenic area is the Wrangell district, with clear rivers, rolling hills, and continuous pine and cypress trees lining the rivers and mountains. The white mountains, black waters, green branches, and leaves create a unique and interesting view. (To be continued)

### Fierce Resistance by French Troops in Southern Madagascar; British Troops Enter Diego Suarez; Surrender Negotiations Underway

Vichy, July 7th, Havas News Agency: A message received this afternoon from Madagascar confirms that British troops have entered the port of Diego Suarez. The defending troops are conducting negotiations with the British authorities. South of Diego Suarez, resistance continues. Governor-General Annet of Madagascar has announced that he is determined to continue resistance, even after the fall of Diego Suarez, and will resolutely challenge the enemy with his isolated forces.

Clermont-Ferrand, July 8th, Havas News Agency: According to reliable sources, although the port of Diego Suarez in Madagascar has fallen, part of the French navy has retreated to the south and east coast of the port and is still resisting. The area is mountainous, conducive to guerrilla warfare. It remains to be seen whether the British intend to occupy the entire island or limit their occupation to the strategically important area of North Bay. The French garrison on the island totals approximately 7,000 men, with only 1,300 in the north and 6,000 in the interior. The air force is very limited, and all aircraft stationed at Diego Suarez are outdated, totaling fourteen, nine of which have been destroyed.

Vichy, July 7th, Havas News Agency: Late tonight, this dispatch received a telegram from Governor-General Annet of Madagascar, continuing to report on the battle of Diego Suarez, stating: "Under the fierce barrage of naval guns, British troops landed in Courrier Bay, with infantry in the lead, followed closely by several light tanks. The tank force formed a barrier in front of the infantry and opened fire on the island's defenders. Enemy aircraft carriers also dispatched planes to assist. The French forces, with limited manpower and lacking necessary equipment, were unable to counterattack and had to retreat. However, the British advance was soon halted, and our troops recaptured several positions. Several hours later, the British launched another attack, with their armored units breaking through the French lines and isolating the command headquarters of the Diego Suarez garrison. The army and navy commanders were captured simultaneously. The garrison was thrown into confusion, but the French troops continued to fight in small groups throughout the night, until 8:40 this morning when they surrendered. The British suffered heavy casualties, with twelve tanks and seven aircraft destroyed."

London, July 8th, Reuters: The British Foreign Office today released a statement outlining the proposals submitted by the commander of the British expeditionary force to Madagascar to the French authorities. It stated that during the initial landing in Courrier Bay, before encountering active resistance, the British commander, acting on instructions from the British government, presented the following proposals to the French authorities in Madagascar, in order to facilitate their cooperation and avoid bloodshed. The statement said, "The British proposal is that Madagascar remain French, and that French officials, both military and civilian, who cooperate with the Allies will be given salaries and allowances. Otherwise, their repatriation is guaranteed, on the condition that the French do not destroy the island's military and civilian facilities and military supplies." According to London sources, the majority (or more than half) of the French forces in Madagascar are concentrated in the northern part of the island.

### US Policy Toward France: Maintaining Caution; Tensions Ease Slightly

Washington, July 7th, Havas News Agency: Observers here are commenting on the Madagascar situation, saying that after the British occupation of the Diego Suarez military port, Prime Minister Churchill's announcement that the resistance near the port has become localized has eased tensions between the US and France. US political circles, while reluctant to speculate on future developments, have expressed satisfaction that the Madagascar operation is being conducted solely by British forces, with the US only providing support from the sidelines and not directly participating in the fighting. This is because the US and France have a long history of friendly relations, and the Madagascar incident constitutes a serious threat. If US forces were to participate, it would inevitably provoke a strong French backlash. The US government's avoidance of participation is intended to maintain contact with France. Recently, Mr. Hull stated that France would not initiate any final changes in Franco-American relations. This is also greatly appreciated here. Recently, US newspapers and even Congress have been discussing the possibility of seizing Martinique and other French possessions in the Western Hemisphere, but the government does not approve. Some sensationalist journalists still advocate taking harsh action against France, even declaring war, but influential newspapers advocate a cautious policy. Lippmann, a journalist known for representing government views, published a commentary in the "New York Herald Tribune" strongly arguing that any action regarding French territories that could lead to military action or is not closely related to our war against the Axis powers should be avoided. For example, the situation in Martinique is unrelated to the war in Europe and the Pacific. Furthermore, any action that smacks of bullying French forces due to their weakness to achieve easy victory should also be avoided. Therefore, the issues of Martinique, Guadeloupe, and Guyana should be left entirely to President Roosevelt and his advisors, as only the government can determine their military value. There is reason to believe that the government has taken precautionary steps, but there is no need to apply further pressure.

### Germany Strengthens Policy Toward France; New Appointee as General Inspector in Paris; Laval's Berlin Trip Denied

Stockholm, Sweden, July 8th, Havas News Agency: Reports state that rumors of French Prime Minister Laval's visit to Berlin are inaccurate, according to Berlin political circles yesterday. In addition, German Police Chief Heydrich has appointed Oberg as the General Inspector of the German Police in Paris, seen as a prelude to Germany strengthening its policy toward France.

Bern, Switzerland, July 8th, Havas News Agency: Reports state that German Police Chief Heydrich is currently in Paris, tasked with reorganizing the police to strengthen German control in the occupied territories.

Bern, Switzerland, July 8th, Havas News Agency: The "Neue Zürcher Zeitung" recently published a dispatch from its Berlin correspondent stating that British and American newspapers have discussed the future occupation of Martinique and have also expressed their opinions on the ports of Dakar, Oran, and Bizerte. This is being taken very seriously in Berlin, and there is deep concern that the occupation of Madagascar will be a precursor to similar events. Rumors that French Prime Minister Laval plans to visit Germany for talks with German leaders have been officially denied by the German Foreign Ministry.

### Canadian Representative to France to Return Home for Consultation

Ottawa, July 7th, Havas News Agency: Prime Minister Mackenzie King stated that Canadian representative to France, Dupe, is expected to return from London within the week to report to the authorities on French-Canadian relations. He stated that he would not comment on the matter until he had read the report.

### Axis Nationals in the Americas to Return Home by Ship

Lisbon, July 8th, Transoceanic News Agency: A dispatch from New York states that 948 Axis nationals and diplomats are returning home on a Swedish mail ship. 410 of them are from the United States. The rest are from Colombia, Panama, Nicaragua, Guatemala, Venezuela, Cuba, Costa Rica, Haiti, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, and Honduras. Yesterday morning, the passengers arrived by special train at the New Jersey pier where the ship was docked. The former German and Italian representatives to the United States, as well as the leaders of the former Hungarian, Romanian, and Bulgarian diplomatic corps, were among the first to return. A dispatch from Rio de Janeiro states that the German Ambassador to Brazil, Prüfer, and the Italian Ambassador, Quaroni, refused to board the "Bajé" and "Campos" ships returning Axis nationals from Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay because the ships were too small to accommodate everyone at once, and they expressed their willingness to return on the last ship with the rest of the German and Italian nationals.

Beijing, July 8th, Transoceanic News Agency: A spokesman for the Japanese Embassy here announced at an information conference yesterday that four large mail ships will carry British and American diplomats and nationals out of East Asia to Mozambique to exchange for Japanese nationals. Two of the ships will sail from Japan and dock at Sai Kung in Hong Kong. The others will sail from the North Sea to Lourenço Marques. They are scheduled to depart in early June and are expected to arrive in Mozambique in early July.

### Madagascar Island (2)

In June 1642, during the reign of Louis XIII, a captain from Dieppe named Riganlt requested exclusive rights from Cardinal Richelieu to operate on the island of Madagascar. The request was approved. At the time, Superintendent Fouguet and his companion Floeourt were ambitious individuals eager to explore overseas. Pronis initially occupied Sainte-Marie Island and began operations in Baie Sainte Luce. However, due to widespread epidemics, many settlers died, forcing them to move south in search of a more temperate climate. Later, they landed at Fort Dauphin. Although supported by troops sent by King Louis XIV, progress was difficult due to the strong opposition from the island's women. Pronis attempted to win over the daughter of a local chieftain and order her to betray them, but the plot was discovered, and all the Frenchmen were killed.

Subsequently, the East India Company appointed Étienne de Flacourt as the governor of the island. He landed at Fort Dauphin in 1649. Although severely threatened by diseases, things progressed much more smoothly than before. With the cooperation of the natives, he laid the foundation for pacifying them, and he presented 300 chiefs with French honorary headgear. However, he died during a voyage to France in 1660 to raise funds, and the hard work of the past few years was destroyed.

In 1664, the East India Company renamed the island "French Orient" and appointed Colbert as governor, with the capital at Dauphin. This time, with a concrete plan, the development was very satisfactory. However, on Christmas in 1671, while the French were gathering in churches for Mass, the natives suddenly rebelled and massacred them all, making it one of the most tragic chapters in French colonial history.

In the 18th century, the Polish-born Benyowsky made significant contributions to the island's development. Later, in the early 19th century, Napoleon was struggling at home during a period of internal strife and upheaval; the government's power could not reach far enough. Although three people (Lahorde, Lambert, Lastelle) were operating on the island, they had no successes. Finally, when the domestic situation had stabilized, the French had the resources to develop the island. Although it went through three republics, the rulers never interrupted the development of this island. In 1885, it became a French protectorate. After the efforts of Gallieni, it was formally transformed into a French colony in 1896.

### Governance by Legal Persons

Gallieni's management of Madagascar is an immortal achievement. To this day, his governance remains deeply etched in the memory of the French. In the past, the island lacked a unified political organization, and everything remained in a semi-civilized state. After Gallieni took office, he first established a sound central administrative structure, followed by the construction of water conservancy and industries. The railway line from Tananarive to the east coast was built at this time. In addition, telephone and telegraph lines were erected at important locations on the island to facilitate communication. Thus, after years of arduous management, the social situation had a foundation. Gallieni served successively for ten years, after 1905, the governors were still Augagueur Garbit, Narcel Olivier, and others, all of whom were capable figures in French colonial history.

Today, with the surge of the times, previously unnoticed and uncivilized areas are also being influenced by modern civilization and embarking on a new path. The island's administrative organization is the same as other French colonies, with the governor alone holding all power on the island. Even the military leaders are under his control. The governor is only responsible to the colonial department of his home country, so he is effectively the leader with full power on the island. However, to improve administrative efficiency, the island also has administrative, financial, national defense, and advisory council, and other agencies. Council members are half legal persons and half natives, but natives have no right to participate in the national defense council, which is composed of the highest commander of the local garrison, the army, artillery commander, and French municipal officials and legal professionals.

The total population of Madagascar is about three and a half million, with only about ten thousand legal persons. In terms of population density, there are only five or six people per square kilometer. Among the natives, the Hova people are the most influential, numbering one million. In the past, before the invasion of Western nations, they were the actual rulers of the island. This custom has persisted for a long time, so although the local government has expressly ordered that all ethnic groups have equal rights, the Hova people still have a solid latent power in society. The common language on the island is the Hova language. This dialect has been influenced by foreign ethnic groups over the past few centuries and is completely different from its original pronunciation. This dialect is closer to the Arabic and Malay language families, which provides irrefutable proof for the theory that the island's people migrated from Malay.

Since Madagascar was formally changed to a colony, it has spared no effort in health construction. The island is plagued by miasma and epidemics, a situation similar to western Yunnan in our country. In particular, the Belsieo and Itasy regions are even more severely affected. Every year, tens of millions of people die directly or indirectly from this disease. This is the most concerning and serious issue for the local government. In recent years, after research by experts, a concrete plan has been drafted, first establishing a prevention agency in the Fiauaratiisoa province. The results of the trials have been significantly effective. To further improve the health of the islanders, a medical school and a Pasteur Institute were established. The latter was founded in 1898 by Dr. Thiroux. The medical school in Tananarive has trained more than seven or eight hundred doctors. Currently, the island has no less than one hundred hospitals with complete equipment, and even in remote villages, there are modern scientific medical facilities.

Regarding the region’s education, schools are mostly concentrated in the capital. In addition to the highest institution, the medical school, Tananarive also has two complete secondary schools. There are about ten primary schools on the island, half of which are founded by the government and half by churches. One hundred thousand people are educated.

### Public Concession Citizen Certificates to Be Issued Starting Tomorrow; No Need to Print Names on Photos; Issuance Based on Residence

The Public Concession's Shanghai Municipal Council (SMC) Police Department has decided to start issuing citizen certificates on May 11th. Residents within the Public Concession can obtain application forms from their 保長 (bao zhang - neighborhood head). After filling them out in detail, they should personally submit them, along with two two-inch photographs, to the local police station for verification and issuance. As for the citizen certificate photographs, they can be taken at designated photography studios by the Photographic Industry Association. The fee is 法幣 (national currency) $2.20 for four copies.

The SMC Police Department has started issuing citizen certificates to maintain security within the concession. However, according to the Photographic Industry Association, it was planned to print the certificate holder's name on their photograph. Regarding this matter, the 保甲部 (bao jia department - neighborhood security department) of the Police Department announced yesterday that this would be unaesthetic. Therefore, the Photographic Industry Association has been notified to instruct members to correct this. At the same time, previously taken photographs that meet the requirements for citizen certificate photographs (one-inch half-length) are all acceptable and do not need to be retaken.

Red and Green Lines

According to a reporter from the 大通社 (Datong News Agency), in addition to what was reported in yesterday's newspaper, the citizen certificate also has a green line printed on it. Those with red lines are issued to citizens in Area A, which includes the Central Police Station, the 老閘 (Old Gate) Police Station, and the Chengdu Road Police Station area. Those with green lines are issued to citizens in Area B, which includes the 新閘 (New Gate) Police Station, the Gordon Road Police Station, and the 静安寺 (Jing'an Temple) Police Station area. Special citizen certificates do not have red or green lines.

Residence as the Standard

The scope of citizen certificate issuance is based on the area of residence. The location of work, if it is mobile or for official business, cannot be used as the standard. For example, if a person resides in the French Concession but works in the Public Concession, they must obtain a residence identity card from the French Concession. The rest is analogous. As for the application procedure, two points should be noted: the application form must have the signature and seal of the household head and the 甲長 (jia zhang - community leader) to be valid. After the household head and 甲長 have signed and sealed the application form, the applicant should submit the application form and two photographs to the police station to which they belong.

Photography Materials Needed

It is also learned that the photography for citizen certificates has already started. However, due to the wide need, the amount of photographic materials consumed is also huge. The Photography Industry Association of this city was previously designated by the SMC to take citizen certificate photographs. However, due to the extreme shortage of photographic materials, there are concerns that they will be insufficient. They have requested assistance from the SMC to ensure a sufficient inventory of raw materials. The SMC has turned to two major Japanese photography studios, requesting them to supply the members of the Photography Industry Association with the necessary materials for taking citizen certificate photographs. However, the materials stored by these two Japanese photography studios are also decreasing daily, so they have applied to the Japanese authorities to ship photographic materials from Japan for use in Shanghai.

### Zhen Dan Pharmaceutical Exhibition, Extended Dates, Added Valuable Medicines

The National Pharmaceutical Factory of the Aurora University Museum on Rue Lupan has been open for three weeks and has gained the interest of people from all walks of life. Therefore, the audience has not diminished. In addition, the organizers advocate the spirit of scientific national medicine, using public academic lectures and pharmacological experiments to the fullest extent possible. This has aroused the sympathy of the medical, pharmaceutical, scientific, and educational circles. Some visitors have conducted detailed investigations. It is heard that the museum authorities, in response to requests from various circles, will extend the opening hours by one hour, from 1:30 PM to 6:15 PM, and will extend the exhibition for one week until May 17th. Recently, horticultural experts and collectors have exhibited their valuable and rare medicinal plant bonsai. After the exhibits of Mr. Kong Zhiqing, there are famous orchids and other famous flowers from Shanghai, including fifty-year-old 靑木香 (Radix Aristolochiae), as well as 半夏 (Rhizoma Pinelliae) orchids, 石斛 (Dendrobium), etc., all of which are rare. There is also a 九轉紫霞丹 (Nine Revolutions Purple Glow Elixir) truly refined by Taoists, a family secret of a former Qing Dynasty official, never shown to others, now also added to the exhibition for several days. The curious should not miss the opportunity to see it first. In addition, there are two more academic lectures at the conference. On Sunday, May 10th, at 5:30 PM, Dr. Huang Shengbai will speak on "Li Shizhen's Phonology." On the 17th (Sunday) at 5:30 PM, Mr. Zhou Mengbai will speak on "An Example of Studying Traditional Chinese Medicine." The lectures will be held in Room 119, 1st Floor, New Building, Aurora University, 123 Rue Lupan. People from all walks of life are welcome to participate.

### To Facilitate Citizen Entry and Exit, Temporary Passes Issued; More Convenient Than Return-to-Hometown Certificates; Simple Application Procedure Started

The Public Concession authorities, in view of the fact that the issuance of citizen certificates cannot be completed in a short period of time, and that many citizens need this certificate for various regulations, have started issuing temporary passes since yesterday. The pass is valid from now until June 30th. Yesterday, the special affairs agency issued 1,450 blank certificates, ordering the various return-to-hometown certificate offices to issue them, implementing it hastily and without full notice. Therefore, the number of applicants was very small. The return-to-hometown certificate office in the Shanghai Volunteer Corps on Fuzhou Road issued about 200 copies. The validity of this pass is the same as the citizen certificate. However, since the distribution of citizen certificates will inevitably take a long time, this pass is issued first for application.

The use of the temporary pass is exactly the same as the citizen certificate. In addition to proving that the holder is a proper and law-abiding citizen, it can also be used to pass through the Japanese military checkpoints on all sides without restriction. The temporary pass can also be used for returning to one's hometown and does not have the shortcomings of the return-to-hometown certificate, because the return-to-hometown certificate can be used to leave but not to return, while the temporary pass can be used to leave and return. Therefore, the people who most urgently need a temporary pass at present are those who wish to leave Shanghai or enter and exit the Japanese military checkpoints. Otherwise, there is no real need to apply, because the citizen certificate will eventually be issued. If anyone is willing to hold this temporary pass, there are no restrictions on the application.

The application procedure for a temporary pass is extremely simple. First, go to the return-to-hometown certificate office and fill out an application form, which includes name, age, gender, occupation, purpose, Shanghai residence address, and intended destination, etc. If the applicant is a H-person, they should also fill in the name of the factory where they were previously employed, the factory address, the work skills, and the years of service, etc. This form was originally used for applications for leave-Shanghai passes but is now used as an application form for temporary passes. After the application form is filled out, it should be submitted to the office to exchange for the pass. Because fingerprints must be taken on the pass (no photo required), it must be done in person and cannot be collected by proxy. The pass is white, five inches long and four inches wide. It states the current address, occupation, name, age, gender, destination, and purpose (such as visiting relatives, doing business, etc.). It is stamped by the special affairs agency. A fingerprint is taken in the lower right corner of the pass. The stub of the pass states the number, address, name, and destination, and also requires a fingerprint.

### Return-to-Hometown Certificates Continue to Be Issued; Group Return to Hometown by 200 People Can Still Enjoy Half-Price Discount

The French Police Station continues to issue return-to-hometown passes, but the travel discount coupons were cancelled on May 1st. The SMC originally issued return-to-hometown certificates and half-price travel tickets to encourage and subsidize people returning to their hometowns. Those who returned to their hometown with this ticket would have their train and boat fares calculated at half price. Since this month, the half-price tickets have been discontinued. However, the SMC has made other arrangements as a remedy. For example, if hometown associations handle the dispersal of fellow villagers, and the number of people is over 200, the hometown association authorities may request the Dispersal Committee to issue group half-price travel tickets. However, individual half-price tickets are all discontinued.

The Guangdong Native Place Association's Return-to-Hometown Committee for Stranded Fellow Villagers began processing the second batch of free repatriation of fellow villagers on the 3rd of this month. Cantonese citizens who went to register to return to their hometowns were very crowded. As of noon on the 7th, it had reached more than 500 people, exceeding the original quota by a large margin. The second batch is now scheduled to depart by boat to the south on the morning of the 14th of this month. The third batch is scheduled to depart on the 24th. The fourth batch is scheduled to begin registration on the 17th of this month. It is heard that the association has prepared a guide to returning home for the convenience of fellow villagers who are unclear about the return-to-hometown procedures, and it will be distributed by mail upon request, with the return postage attached. It also purchases boat tickets for fellow villagers returning to their hometowns free of any handling fees.

The SMC Chinese Dispersal Committee issued a letter from the Hubei Native Place Association of Shanghai yesterday, saying: "We are assisting your committee in handling the dispersal matters. Of the 200 fellow villagers registered in the first batch, the company only allowed 100 to board the ship. It is still unclear when the remaining 100 can depart. These people are poor and have already returned their houses and sold all their furniture to return to their hometowns. They have no home to return to and are living on the streets, a tragic sight that is unbearable to witness. We hope that you will actively designate ships to the relevant parties as soon as possible so that they can depart as soon as possible."

### Chinese Business Import and Export Industry Plans to Form a Guild to Seek Restoration of Southeast Asian Trade

Among the Chinese import and export trade industries, a number of firms, in view of the need to restore Southeast Asian trade and the development of coastal trade, have initiated the convening of 425 fellow firms to organize a "Shanghai Import and Export Industry Guild" to jointly promote the business of the industry. It is currently in active preparation.

According to a reporter's investigation, the import and export firms that initiated the organization of the guild total 31, namely: Jin Xing Chang, Da Cheng, Jian Mei, Fu He Long, Shi Yu Jin Fa, Nan Tai, Tai Cheng, Ding Feng, Fu Li, De Da, Jie Ke, Yong Kang, Da Yuan, Mao Yuan, Mao Hua, Jian Dong, Jian Nan, Tong Yi, Fu Rong, Yuan Chang, Pacific, Wan Cheng, Asia, Quan Chang Xing, Wu Fang, Quan Rong, Dong Nan, Fu Da, Shun Cheng, Jian Hua, Wu Ping, etc. Each serves as a member of the guild's preparatory committee and has elected Mr. Zheng Xiuxian as the chairman of the preparatory committee at a meeting.

The guild's preparatory office is located at No. 424, 4th Floor, Zhonghui Building, Lao Beimen Street. Yesterday, the office issued a notice stating that the association, in order to meet the needs of the times and promote the future development of the import and export industry in this city, has agreed with the Industry and Commerce Bureau to prepare for the organization of a guild. All firms that are engaged in this business must complete the registration procedures at the preparatory office within five days from the 6th of this month. The office hours are from 10:00 AM to 3:00 PM. It is also heard that the guild's preparatory office is scheduled to hold an inaugural meeting on June 1st and is currently actively preparing.

### Letters to Europe and America Can Also Be Delivered by Chinese People

The International Red Cross office in Shanghai has revealed that it collects letters on behalf of the people of this city and sends them to various parts of Europe and America. Chinese people who have letters to send abroad can also entrust the association to deliver them. The procedure is very simple: first, purchase a specific letter paper from the association at the price of one yuan, then write in English, limited to 25 words (excluding the name and address of the recipient and sender), and hand it over to the association for mailing. It is sent via the Siberian Railway through Turkey to Geneva, and then sent out in batches. It is learned that the first batch of letter paper has now sold out, and the second batch will be sold starting at 3:00 PM next Monday.

### British-Owned Chartered Bank's Withdrawal and Deposit Methods Next Week; No Date Restrictions on Withdrawals and Deposits

According to a reporter's investigation this morning (8th), the British-owned Chartered Bank will have no date restrictions on depositors' withdrawals and deposits starting next Monday (11th). According to the bank, starting this week, the first withdrawals will be processed, and depositors will be divided into two batches according to the first letter of their surname. One batch is limited to withdrawals on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, and the other batch on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays. Up to now, one week has passed, and the crowded situation has gradually disappeared. Therefore, starting next week, the previous restrictions will be lifted. Any depositor can go to withdraw money on any day.

### Inspected This Afternoon

The English-language 大美晚報 (Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury) reports that at 3:30 this afternoon (9th), the Special Service Unit of the SMC Police Department will hold its first inspection at the SMC Shanghai Volunteer Corps drill hall, supervised by the Director of the Police Department, Watanabe Tadashi. Since the reorganization of the Police Department, the Special Service Unit has also been reorganized. It is learned that Watanabe Tadashi also plans to conduct an investigation of the team in the near future.

### Extortion Under the Guise of Promoting Stamps

Recently, Zhou Baoquan, a staff member of the Shanghai Special Zone Office of the Zhejiang and Anhui Tax Bureau and a native of Jiangbei, was responsible for promoting the new stamp tax. At about 5:00 PM on the 7th of this month, he took the opportunity to peddle stamp tax, went to Chunhe Restaurant at 705 Xiaoshadu Road, Wang Chengjiang Carpentry at 721, and Zhu Rongji Lime Shop to inspect the stamps affixed to the account books. He claimed that they did not comply with the bureau's regulations and had affixed too few stamps, and threatened to report them to the Tax Bureau for punishment, demanding a reserve of 200 yuan. As a result, he said that if they were sensible, they could avoid trouble, and each household was extorted for 10 yuan before he fled. The reported stationed Chinese police arrested him and took him to the Gordon Road Police Station. He was prosecuted for extortion and sent to court. His testimony was evasive, and he was ordered to be detained pending sentencing on a fixed date.

### Fraud Through Fictitious Company

Wu Youqian, a Ningbo native who worked in the office of the Greater China Weaving Factory at 192 Nanjing Road, initiated the organization of the Huimin Import and Export Company last year, soliciting investment funds widely. Wang Tianyou, residing at No. 10, Lane 575, Zhejiang Road, was introduced and invested 10,000 yuan, which he paid on November 4th. Unexpectedly, the Huimin Company was dissolved after the 8th. All the funds received should be returned in full according to the regulations, but Wang Tianyou has not seen Wu return the money to date, and he is undoubtedly being embezzled. He reported the information to the General Patrol Room, which sent Chinese detective Wang Qi to 192 Nanjing Road yesterday to arrest and detain Wu Youqian, pending transfer.

### Movie Theaters and Drama Troupes to Register Immediately; Previously Registered Troupes Must Re-Register; Those Without Registration Certificates Will Not Be Allowed to Operate After the Deadline

The Police Department of the Public Concession has decided to process the registration of movie theaters, theaters, or other similar theaters in the Public Concession from now until June 15th. Regardless of whether they previously held a license from the SMC, they must register with the Special High Class of the SMC Police Department (Room 210, 2nd Floor, No. 185 Fuzhou Road). If the above-mentioned theaters have not registered and obtained a registration certificate by the deadline, they will not be allowed to operate. In addition, any professional or amateur drama troupe that held a registration certificate before May 2B must also bring the registration certificate to the above-mentioned location for re-registration before the above-mentioned deadline to be valid. Otherwise, the registration certificate held will not continue to be valid. If any new drama troupe is created in the future, it must apply, otherwise it will be subject to appropriate punishment.

### Evacuation of British and American Nationals from the Far East to Be Carried Out by Four Ships; Three Japanese Ships and One Italian Ship to Sail in Early June; List of Evacuees Not Yet Available

The English-language 大美晚報 (Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury) reports that Kawasaki, a spokesman for the Japanese Embassy, ​​confirmed this morning the report from North China that some British and American diplomats would leave the Far East in early June on commercial transports bound for Mozambique. However, the Swiss Consulate declined to comment on the report, and an official said that details of the evacuation were still being discussed and resolved. According to a report from 北平 (Beijing) 通訊社 (News Agency), the spokesman for the Japanese Embassy in the city said that four large transports would carry British and American officials and civilians from the Far East to Mozambique in exchange for Japanese nationals. The four ships are the Japanese ships Kamakura Maru, Asama Maru, Tatuta Maru, and the Italian ship Conte Verde. The first two ships will sail from Japan, calling at Hong Kong and Saigon. The latter two ships will sail directly from Shanghai to Lourenço Marques. Each ship is scheduled to sail in early June and arrive in Mozambique in early July. The four ships are scheduled to converge somewhere in the Indian Ocean en route.

Kawasaki also said that the list of evacuees would not be available until the end of this month. However, if there is sufficient cabin space on the ships, news reporters and civilians will have the opportunity to participate in the evacuation. The names and departure dates of the evacuation ships have been notified by Tokyo to London and Washington. The evacuation of all British and American nationals in Shanghai is, according to Kawasaki, not a problem, but the limitation of ship cabin space must be considered first.

### Letter Extortion Cracked

Gao Yourong, a local resident who works in printing and lives at No. 27, Lane 381, Weihaiwei Road, received four threatening letters from the 24th of last month to the day before yesterday. The words in the letters were fierce, and there were also bullets and a demand for 10,000 yuan. Later, he automatically reduced the amount to 1,000 yuan. Gao reported the information to the Chengdu Road Police Station. Chinese detective Zhang Peiguan and Tan Jinhai were assigned to investigate. According to the address and time in the letter, they went to the Kai Na Road in western Shanghai and arrested the criminal Li Hongkui from Ningbo and Li Kaiming from Hunan. They confessed that the instigator was Liu Yusheng from Shandong (who was a former tenant of Gao), who was hiding in Zhu Anbang. They went again and brought Liu to the police station for investigation.

### Two Young Girls Lured Away, Price Negotiated for Sale, Detective Breaks Case, Two Girls Rescued from Trap

In Room 13 of the Xinxiang Hotel at No. 7, near the iron gate of Route Lafayette, there is a human trafficking organization that specializes in sending male and female accomplices to lure women and children and carry them to other ports for sale, separating families. Nothing is more hateful than this. Detective Ke Enqing and Detective Ke Enqi of the French Police Station learned of this and rushed to the address at 2:00 PM the day before yesterday. On the spot, they arrested the traffickers Zhang Jingyi (23 years old, from Huzhou), Shen A Si (30 years old, from Huzhou), Zhang Zhaoxiang (51 years old, from Shandong), Zhou Zhengui (48 years old, from Yangzhou), Cai Bingsheng (30 years old, from Zhenjiang), and other five people, and rescued the abducted girls Chen Xiaomei (17 years old, from Huizhou) and Deng Zhenbao (15 years old, from Wenzhou). When the detectives went to arrest them, the gang was discussing the sale price of the two girls, Chen and Deng. Zhang Zhaoxiang was a Qingdao gang broker specializing in selling women for profit in Shanghai and Qingdao. It had been agreed that Deng Zhenbao would be sold to Zhang Zhaoxiang for 600 yuan and taken to Qingdao to be resold to a brothel as a prostitute. Chen and Deng were abducted while playing in the 大世界 (Great World entertainment center). The father of the girl Deng worked in the judicial field and had served as a judge. The detectives took the bandits back to the police station for further investigation and legal action. Chen and Deng were temporarily left at the police station to await the end of the investigation and be claimed by their families for reunion.

### Movie Theaters Increase Ticket Prices Due to New Taxes

### Wood-Burning Automobiles

— Ding Zuce

Since the war extended to the Pacific, the supply of gasoline for automobiles has been interrupted. Most of the ten thousand or more automobiles that sped across Shanghai have become hungry ghosts due to the gasoline shortage. Today, the vehicles that continue to run, apart from a very few still using gasoline, whether passenger cars, trucks, or buses, have mostly converted to other fuels.

Regarding General Principles

Automobiles, classified by their power source, can be divided into gasoline automobiles, diesel automobiles (also known as Diesel automobiles), steam automobiles, and electric automobiles. Except for the latter two types, which have different structures, the gasoline and diesel automobiles both belong to the internal combustion engine category. These are the most widely adopted types recently, with gasoline automobiles being the most common, followed by diesel automobiles. For example, the British-owned China General Omnibus Company and the French-owned French Omnibus Company in this city mostly use diesel automobiles.

In terms of structure, diesel automobiles are exactly the same as gasoline automobiles, except for the engine. The fuel for diesel automobiles is not limited to diesel; all heavy oils, such as soybean oil, raw oil, rapeseed oil, cottonseed oil, and tung oil, can be used as fuel. However, since most diesel automobiles are military-type vehicles, such as buses and cargo trucks, ordinary small and medium-sized passenger cars are mostly gasoline automobiles.

The fuel used by the gasoline automobile engine is gasoline, but before it enters the cylinder for combustion, it must be converted into gas—a type of hydrocarbon gas. Therefore, any gas with a similar quality to gasoline gas can be a substitute for gasoline. Thus, in times of gasoline shortage or when it is cost-effective, alcohol, wood charcoal, white coal, coke, gas, firewood, biogas, calcium carbide gas, and liquid petroleum gas can all be used as fuel for automobiles. However, since automobiles were originally designed to use gasoline, they are most active and convenient when using gasoline. It is only as a last resort that alternative fuels are used, and although they can make the automobile run, they cannot provide the same convenience as gasoline.

To put it more simply, the adoption of alternative fuels like wood charcoal for automobiles is due to wartime or economic pressure and is not the best solution. It is similar to the gradual degradation of our rice consumption. People who are used to eating rice now have to eat long-grain rice, and even worse, broken rice, corn, sorghum, and even bean and grain husks, just to fill their stomachs without seeking palatable taste.

The adoption of alternative fuels for automobiles does not involve significant changes to the original parts, but only requires the addition of additional parts to convert the alternative fuel into gas. When the gasoline supply is restored in the future, gasoline can still be used as fuel. Therefore, there is no concern about damaging the automobile after adopting alternative fuels.

Alcohol Can Replace Gasoline

Among alternative fuels, the best is alcohol-mixed gasoline, which involves mixing 20% to 30% alcohol with gasoline. Its effectiveness is similar to using pure gasoline, and there is no need to install additional parts, but it can save 20% to 30% of gasoline. Unfortunately, this type of alcohol must be anhydrous alcohol with a composition of 99.5% to be suitable. Before the war, the Esling produced by the Meilong Alcohol Factory was this type of alcohol. Currently, the production in Shanghai is minimal, and the price is very high, so it cannot be widely used.

Gas, Wood Charcoal, White Coal

The next option is to use gas, which is the gas from the Shanghai Gas Company. Although there are users in this city, they are few. The method involves placing a large, airtight bag on top of the automobile, filled with gas. No heavy additional parts are required. The disadvantage is that the gas bag is bulky and unsightly, and the amount of gas it holds can only provide for short-distance travel. However, the installation is simple and economical. If liquid gas can be installed, which involves compressing a large amount of gas under high pressure to condense it into liquid and storing it in a sturdy tank, it can be used for long distances and avoids the hassle of constantly adding gas.

The most prevalent alternative fuels for automobiles currently are wood charcoal, white coal, and coke, collectively referred to as wood charcoal automobiles. There are many styles, as shown in Figure 1, which is the most common type. It involves adding parts to the rear of an ordinary automobile. These parts can also be hidden inside the trunk of the car, but there are still ventilated compartments and windows that slightly reveal the contents of the wood charcoal machine. (To be continued)

### Today's Aurora Cup Charity Football Match: Hequn Red and White Teams to Compete Against Hongyuan and Nie Zhongcheng Respectively

The Aurora Cup charity football match will feature two matches starting at 2:30 PM today at the school's field on Lubean Road. In the first match, Hequn White will face Nie Zhongcheng. The former has one win and three losses in the competition, with good players such as Cao Qinfang, Chen Yongbi, and Zhu Meilong. The latter is a strong team from the school and once defeated the West Union B team, so their strength should not be underestimated. Although they have suffered three defeats in this competition, Hequn White should not be too optimistic. The outcome is difficult to predict, and a fierce battle is inevitable. In the second match, Hequn Red will play against Hongyuan. The latter is mediocre in strength and weak in formation, so they have lost every match. Hequn Red has assembled most of the famous players from Donghua, with Zhang Banglun and Zhuang Youren on defense, Han Long and Hai Jia Youliang on offense, and A Dai in the center. Their line is exceptionally strong, and they were highly favored to win the championship. Unfortunately, they suffered at the hands of the French police last week due to unfair penalties, which is a pity. Today, they will face Hongyuan and should be able to win easily. Tickets are priced at two yuan and five yuan. The Aurora Cup has been underway for more than a month since its opening. After today's two matches, only two more matches remain: French Police vs. Aurora and Hongyuan vs. Nie Zhongcheng.

Today's schedule:
Hequn White vs. Nie Zhongcheng - 2:30 PM
Hequn Red vs. Hongyuan - 4:15 PM

### Factory Orders Not Easy to Deliver, Double Horse Yarn Also Affected, Spot Goods Still Good

The spot market for cotton yarn is good, because the basis is tightening. However, there are some problems with the delivery of some factory orders. 42-count Blue Phoenix is priced at 12,700 to 13,750 yuan, 80-count Sunlight at 15,000 yuan, 60-count Colorful Ball at 24,500 yuan, 42-count Yanghe at 13,350 yuan, Father's Wool Butterfly at 12,800 yuan, 60-count Bull Head at 22,900 yuan, 20-count Fairy Peach at 7,050 yuan, Blue Phoenix at 7,350 to 7,400 yuan, Moon Lute at 6,750 yuan, Water Moon at 7,200 yuan, Steed at 7,200 yuan, Double Horse at 6,100 to 6,420 yuan, 16-count Red Kui Xing at 6,440+ yuan to 6,500 yuan, 18-count Weaver Girl at 6,200 yuan, 10-count Red Double Horse at 4,700 yuan to 4,850 yuan, Father's Boy Scout at 4,620 yuan to 4,800 yuan, Red Bao Yi at 4,690 yuan, 8-count Three Tigers at 4,900 yuan, 16-count Earth at 6,200 yuan. The initial factory order for 20-count Double Horse opened at 5,650 yuan, then rose to 5,730 yuan. However, because some factory orders in the market faced difficulties in cash withdrawal and delivery, sentiment loosened and selling pressure increased sharply. The market fell rapidly to 5,320 yuan, but rebounded slightly at the close to 5,410 yuan.

### Piece Goods Intended to Fall but Rose Instead

Yesterday's factory cloth market was weak in the morning and firm in the afternoon, showing a tendency to rise rather than fall. Initially, the market was driven down by rumors of a sharp drop in Double Horse factory orders. Subsequently, due to the continued high prices of spot yarn and a tight fabric basis, 16-pound Earth coarse cloth opened at 251.2 yuan and later rebounded to 257 yuan. Flying Goose opened at 243 yuan and rose to 245 yuan. 8-pound Zhenzhong opened at 130 yuan and rose to 132 yuan. 12-pound Fugui fine cloth spot goods were traded as high as 215 yuan, and then rebounded to 217 yuan. Bank orders were particularly popular, rising to 220.75 yuan. Only Fugui factory orders were the weakest, falling to 175 yuan. Ten-forest cloth also rose by about 35 yuan per piece. Peach Girl and Chick were traded at 349 to 350 yuan in the afternoon.

East cloth initially fell and then rose, with fluctuations of about 10 yuan. Dragon Head fine cloth new orders started at 277 yuan, fell to 27.5 yuan, and then rose to 281.5 yuan at noon. In the afternoon, it opened at 281 yuan and closed at 283 yuan, a rise of 5 jiao compared to the previous day. Colorful Ball fine cloth closed at 250 yuan. Fine twill suddenly surged, with Baby opening at 225 yuan and Five Blessings Double Fish rising to 228 yuan. Called Gentleman drill red orders were slightly down to 9 yuan and 3 fen in the morning, and rose again to 9 yuan and 3 jiao in the evening.

### Spot Gold Number Recovers

Yesterday's spot gold underground market showed a steady performance. Securities firms were selling on behalf of Northern gangs, while cash firms recovered and advanced. Even after the sudden surge the previous day, market sentiment remained firm. Trading was not active. In the morning, each tael (ten liang) opened at 21,700 yuan, an increase of 350 yuan, as afternoon prices had already risen sharply. Securities firms and gold firms helped to sell and retreated, from 21,750 yuan to 450 yuan. Soon, a certain cash firm showed good appetite and immediately rebounded, rising again to 21,750 yuan. The final transaction price at noon was 21,700 yuan, an increase of 350 yuan compared to the previous day's closing price, and 100 yuan higher than the afternoon price. There was a difference of 300 yuan that day. At the end, there was demand but no supply at 21,700 yuan.

The exchange price for gold jewelry in silverware shops was still listed at 2,250 yuan by Daxin and other peers (purchase price reduced by 200 yuan). Sycee silver was listed at 18 yuan, and the black market price was 16 yuan and 2.3 jiao. Silver coins were averaging 9 yuan and 6.7 jiao each.

### Foreign Currencies Slightly Lower

Yesterday's foreign currency market saw declines in both British and American gold pounds by 10 yuan each. The former was 510 yuan, and the latter was 520 yuan. American drafts were sold at 33 yuan for forward positions. Hong Kong drafts were slightly lower by 1 jiao, at 5 yuan and 1 jiao. Military drafts opened in the morning at 7 yuan, 1 jiao and 9 fen, and then retreated to 1 jiao and 1 fen, finally settling at 7 yuan, 1 jiao and 3 fen. The result was similar to the previous day.

Yesterday's discount rate for draft bills was between 14 and 18 yuan per thousand, and continued to show a slight increase. The interbank lending rate of the Money Industry Association was still 1 jiao. The difference between new and old legal tender was about 3 jiao and 2 fen per yuan.

### Internal Debt Rose and Settled

The government bond gray market was quite stable yesterday. Both long and short positions temporarily remained inactive. The market saw some short-covering transactions. Because of the increased floating profits, types C and E saw mostly settlement, so the bonds could not follow the upward trend. The situation on the trading floor is likely to remain unchanged this week. The reason is that the selling side has temporarily stopped, and the buying side is also watching, so yesterday's trading volume was also greatly reduced. However, this stability cannot last forever, as both sides are eager to try. Yesterday, only Runde disposed of more bonds, while Tongli's capital outflow was rare. San Kai slightly reduced its long positions. In addition, Renfeng, Hengyu, and Dazhong slightly sold off. Buyers included Jiufeng, Hongda, Shuntai, Tongyuan, Hu Heji, Xinhua, and general retail investors, who continued to buy, but were not enthusiastic. As a result, A and B rose by 3 to 7 jiao, type C remained unchanged, and type E fell slightly by 1 jiao. The transaction volume was only more than 400,000 yuan. A brief table is listed below:

| Category | High   | Low    | Closing | Change from Previous Day |
|----------|--------|--------|---------|-------------------------|
| A        | 66.70  | 66.50  | 66.70   | +0.70                  |
| B        | 60.60  | 60.00  | 60.60   | +0.70                  |
| C        | 60.20  | 59.70  | 59.70   | 0                      |
| D        | 55.10  | 54.80  | 55.00   | +0.04                  |
| E        | 57.85  | 57.00  | 57.00   | -0.020                 |

### Overseas Stocks Decline Sharply

Yesterday's overseas stock spot market continued to decline sharply. A total of 39,500 shares were traded. Sino-Japanese Textile was the most active, with 20,500 shares traded. The price retreated from 16 yuan to 15.5 yuan, then rose to 16.1 yuan in the afternoon, and finally settled at 15.8 yuan, a sharp drop of 7 jiao. 1,000 shares of Jardine Textile fell from 38.5 yuan to 37.75 yuan. 4,500 shares of China Textile were traded at 22 yuan and 21.5 yuan. 1,000 shares of Woolen were traded at 14 yuan and 12.7 jiao. 5,000 shares of Paper were traded at 11.2 jiao, rebounding to 11.5 jiao. 3,000 shares of Ye Guang were traded at 26 yuan and 26.5 yuan.

New Asia (new) fluctuated between 34 yuan and 34.5 yuan. New Asia Materials was traded at 21.5 yuan. New Asia Science was traded at 17.5 yuan.

### Miscellaneous Grains Market Weak, More Losses Than Gains

Transactions of beans continued to lack excitement. Largely because the sale of soybeans had begun and people were adopting a wait-and-see attitude. Red beans declined again by 13 yuan, broad beans were moderately weak, and there were no transactions for yellow beans. Sales included 170 packages of Chongming sand broad beans, priced at 134 yuan to 120 yuan, and 230 packages of sand red beans at 132 yuan and 5 jiao.

Sales of corn were still active and holders frequently raised prices, with prices increasing by another two or three yuan. 420 packages of Wuhu corn opened at 182 yuan self-extracted, and road goods at 186 yuan delivered.

Sales of red sorghum were moderately dull and prices fell by more than one yuan. Sales included 140+ packages of Mingguang red sorghum, priced at 162 yuan and 2 jiao self-extracted.

Sales of bean cakes were slightly active at one point but then returned to weakness. The market was initially firm and then weakened. The result was roughly similar to the previous day. Sales included 1,000 pieces of Shengji bean cake old warehouse receipts for June, priced at 57 yuan and 5 jiao to 6 yuan and 5 jiao, 500 pieces of old warehouse receipts for July, priced at 57 yuan and 5 jiao, 500 pieces of old warehouse receipts for May, priced at 56 yuan and 9 jiao, 1,500 white pieces of new warehouse receipts for April, priced at 69 yuan and 5 jiao to 6 yuan and 5 jiao. 1,000 pieces of Lizi cake new warehouse receipts for March, priced at 68 yuan to 7 yuan and 7 jiao and 5 fen, 1,000 pieces of Hankou cake, priced at 51 yuan and 5 jiao.

Transactions of bran were still active yesterday, but due to warehouse rental issues, some retail investors slightly loosened their positions, so prices declined slightly by 5 jiao to one yuan. Sales included 1,800 packages of Sanxin large-package bran, priced at 112 yuan to 111 yuan and 5 jiao, and 1,500 packages of small-package bran, priced at 108 yuan to 107 yuan and 5 jiao.

### Rayon Falls Severely

Yesterday, the rayon market was in a severe decline. In the morning, 120-count Tianqiao bright small boxes opened at 9,070 yuan, gradually declining to 9,000 yuan. Although buyers tried to pull prices up, they continued to decline, plunging to 8,910 yuan. The market showed a downward trend. Some investors bought to pull up the prices, and it recovered slightly to close at 8,990 yuan. 120-count Baifuji bright small boxes were priced at 8,700 yuan. 120-count Jin Sanma bright small boxes fell from 9,000 yuan to 8,900 yuan. 120-count Beauty bright small boxes fell from 8,810 yuan, with strong selling pressure, and continued to decline from 8,760 yuan sharply to 8,595 yuan. Retail investors were particularly eager to sell. Some investors bought to recover, and it slightly recovered to 8,625 yuan. 120-count Jin Huanxing bright large boxes fell sharply from 8,790 yuan to 8,520 yuan, a sharp drop of 270 yuan, which was a disaster.

### Jiaxing Cocoon Merchants Sending Staff to Prepare

Farmers in Fuyang County, Zhejiang Province, raise silkworms believing in Japanese methods. This year, the silkworm season started late and there were not many farmers raising them. However, the silkworm season started earliest in Jiaxing, Jiashan, Banhutongxiang and other places, and there were many farmers raising them. Therefore, cocoon merchants from various places have been sending staff to prepare for setting up and will start weighing cocoons soon.

Wuxing silk cocoons also have a large production, with those from Jili being particularly famous. This year, the breeding season was not good, labor costs were high, leaf prices were also high, road transportation was inconvenient, and sales were not good. The production volume is likely to decrease.

### Cigarette Sales Brisk at Flat Prices, Black Market Quiet

The cigarette market presented a hovering situation. Retail sales in the street were brisk due to flat pricing, so black market sales were rather quiet. Stockpiling and domestic sales were sluggish, so recent transactions were just for show. Yesterday's prices included Great Britain brand at 9,400 yuan per case, Old Knife brand at 7,400 yuan, Pin Hai brand at 9,700 yuan, Five China brand at 5,000 yuan, and Little Fairy brand at 5,200 yuan, all with little difference. Japanese cigarettes included Yuqiang brand at 1,940 yuan, Jin Dalou brand at 2,550 yuan, Red Rose at 1,775 yuan, Quanlu brand at 1,540 yuan, and Guide brand at 1,500 yuan, with slight increases and decreases compared to the previous day.

### Bitter Almonds Decline

Bitter almonds were previously in short supply due to arrivals and lack of storage, and market prices had repeatedly increased, rising by hundreds of yuan. It has now been found that recent sources have arrived. Although high drainage rates mean that the cost is not low, prices have loosened because both merchants and customers have become less willing to buy. Yesterday, the market fell by 50 to 60 yuan.

### Black Leaf Branches Withheld and Not Opened

The stock of black leaf branches on the market is limited. The goods that arrived earlier have already been cleared, and production prices have continued to rise. However, since this item does not last long, only a few have arrived recently. Merchants' prices are too far off, resulting in a stalemate. No transactions have been made so far.

### Xinghua Longan Already Sold Through

Xinghua longan has been out of stock for a long time due to the small amount of stock on the market and the lack of sources. Recently, a customer transferred hundreds of cases from Gulangyu, and the new goods were immediately cleared, selling very well. They were quickly purchased by merchants from this street and gangs from Jing, Su, Hang, etc. Because they were small boxes, the quantity was not large, and they were very suitable for sales. There are still dozens of cases of old goods in stock, and prices are being discussed.

### Diaoqing Sugar Partially Purchased

Yesterday, 100+ packages of the previous batch of Diaoqing sugar were purchased by the authorities, but at a slightly lower price than the fixed price. The remaining unresolved parts may or may not be handled in the same way, or may be allocated by the Taiwan Sugar Company. It has not been decided yet, but it is hoped that industry insiders will try to smooth the sources so that Shanghai people can taste cheaper domestic sugar.

### Canned Foods Are Planning to Form a Joint Group

Yesterday, it was heard that 18 canned food companies were meeting to discuss the establishment of a joint group. Once it is established, each food product will have a proper market.

### Recent Shanghai Drama (Part 2)

— Jin Chuan

The New Shanghai Art Troupe, which has been performing at the Carlton Theatre for a long time, presented "Yang Guifei" and "The Hunchback of Notre Dame" this year. Currently, they are performing the new play "Hero of the Deserted Island." Their main characteristic is their ability to incorporate artistic beauty and make full use of music to complement the development of the plot. Few theater troupes have paid attention to this in the past, and this new attempt has achieved extremely satisfactory results.

In addition, two plays that were performed for a short period this year, "Chu Ba Wang" and "Martyrdom for Love," were both staged at the Lyceum Theatre. The former was written and directed by Yao Ke. Although there were some things to criticize, the arrangement of historical materials was unique, but generally speaking, it was a failure. Compared to "Qing Palace Grievance," which caused a sensation last year, it was much inferior. The latter was directed by Li Pingqian and performed by the Eighth Art Troupe, with good results.

Besides the above formal drama organizations, there is no lack of other theater troupes in Shanghai. But from a dramatic standpoint, they are not worth recommending. They are either temporarily gathered by a few "big stars" or are merely speculative gimmicks from江湖 friends. The better ones may stage some "Autumn Wind Play," which naturally has no artistic value, and the essence of the original work is completely cut away. Others create some farce, spreading poisonous ropes of pornography and debauchery. To call these plays is less appropriate than calling them enlightened plays. They all lack dramatic cultivation, relying only on their own "big star" brand to attract attention. They adopt the shoddy and inferior styles of recent films and put them on stage. In fact, we know that acting in film and drama are completely different things. An excellent film actor is not necessarily a good stage actor. Because they cater to the psychology of Shanghai citizens, they can also gain a group of ignorant audiences. However, this kind of low-level, vulgar performance will sooner or later be spurned by people.

After this Pacific War, there is a significant phenomenon, that is, the activities of small theater troupes and school theater troupes have been greatly reduced. Naturally, environmental difficulties and funding issues have become the main reasons for the cessation of these activities. However, we still hope that they can gradually revive, because this is also an indispensable and powerful force in the drama world.

Due to the continued soaring prices, current drama prices have all increased. We can naturally understand that this is the helpless plight of drama people. However, the burden on the audience has therefore increased, and some people cannot help but sigh at the cost. In the past, all theaters had the system of adding early performances, with half-price tickets, in order to give preferential treatment to students, etc. In this way, those who love drama but are restricted by economic limitations can also have the opportunity to appreciate it. We think this system has the necessity of being re-established.

### Talking About Ke Chan Ying Tingzi (Talk About Ke Chan's Son)

— Zhang Huiyu

Tan Ying, the "Mysterious Girl," suffered from eye disease last summer after filming "One Jade Ring" in Shanghai due to overwork, which was very painful. My husband, Cheng Bu Gao, was quite successful in Hong Kong and wired Tan Ying to go to Hong Kong. Therefore, Tan Ying left the Shanghai film industry and bid farewell to the general Shanghai movie fans.

Soon after arriving in Hong Kong, Tan Ying went to Kunming with Cheng Bu Gao. The husband and wife were very affectionate. However, they still had no children. After resting in Kunming for a long time, her abdomen suddenly swelled, and she became heavily pregnant, with childbirth imminent. Bu Gao was very happy and bought baby supplies, busy beyond compare.

Recently, good news came that Tan Ying suddenly felt severe abdominal pain on February 28, knowing that she was about to give birth. She was rushed to Gao Xiao Ci's Qun Sanatorium. Unexpectedly, just as she entered the waiting room, the fetus landed on the floor with a "gua gua" sound. It was a boy, actually Little Cheng rather than Little Tan.

### Review of "Women's Apartment"

— Fan Shiren

Playwright Yi Qi led a group of trained young artists and recently staged "Women's Apartment" at the Lafayette Theatre, directed by Qiao Jun. The reporter went to watch with eager expectations and gained an excellent impression. It is said that this play is Mr. Xu's maiden work, but his directing technique is quite mature, and the points, surfaces, and lines are handled appropriately, which is commendable. All the actors were able to give full play to their strengths, and the whole play was even more wonderful. The results were indeed very good!

Seven women live in the apartment, but each has her own personality and different lives. Zhao Songyun, as Du Wei, clearly presented a woman who has experienced the world and struggled hard to the audience through her words and actions, which is very rare. Songyun's daughter, Guan Ying, is innocent and lively, like a pure white silk, and Pan Ruo Ri's performance is exactly like the character. Chen Peipei is a woman with a strong sense of vanity. Cai Gelan's performance of her love affair with Commissioner Luo, playing with the game of cat and mouse, is also good. Li Jie's role as Ama won a lot of laughter from the audience and is a rare talent among female comedians. Sha Xia is a more active girl in the apartment. Li Ziyun firmly grasped the embrace of the characters in the play, and forcefully impressed her new enlightenment into the minds of the audience, making the central consciousness of the whole play clear and obvious, which is highly commendable. As for Liu Lian's Liu Lizhu, she is even more outstanding. As a girl of only fifteen years old, she can convey her spirit, which is especially commendable. We have unlimited hope for the future of this new artist!

### Sharing the Same Boat in Storm

— He Jia Zhi

(4) In the Afterglow

Fei Changhe fled in a panic. Second Madam Ye laughed: "Huang Long is straightforward. People like this only deserve Huang Long to deal with. He has thick arms and a loud voice. He is afraid when he meets him. Huang Long, why did you think of coming?" Cui Zhen coughed outside and walked in, nodding to Huang Long. Wei Cheng pointed and said: "This is Sister Cui Zhen. No one would believe that this nephew has this uncle." Huang Long did not answer Second Madam Ye's words, nor did he greet Cui Zhen. He only tucked Wei Cheng's arm and laughed: "Brother Wei Cheng, go inside." Wei Cheng went into the inner room with him and asked what was the matter. Huang Long closed the door and kept rummaging in his pockets with both hands, taking out a lot of banknotes and putting them on the bed; he also rummaged in the pockets on both sides of his trousers, also taking out money, including silver dollars, copper coins, and corner notes, and putting them all on the bed. Wei Cheng was very surprised and said: "Where did this come from?" Huang Long pulled Wei Cheng to sit on the edge of the bed and laughed: "Don't you need money? Look, isn't this money? Take it and use it. I don't know how much."

Wei Cheng said: "This is impossible!" Huang Long grabbed Wei Cheng's hand and said: "How can you say it's impossible? My money is yours; your money is not necessarily mine." Wei Cheng looked at Huang Long's face for a while and said: "If this money is really yours, I would use it with peace of mind." Huang Long held Wei Cheng's hand even tighter, glared his eyes, raised his eyebrows, and said: "It's mine. Now, taking it out of my pocket, even if it's not mine, it's still mine. Don't worry about it, whether I robbed it, stole it, or cheated it." Wei Cheng looked at the money on the bed. In fact, looking at the money, he could not see what its origin was, but he had to take a look and said: "I'm afraid you got it this way. Brother Huang Long, I'm not some ancient gentleman who is unwilling to use other people's money casually, but I always have to ask about the origin. If the origin is unknown, not only will I use it uneasily, but you will also use it uneasily."

The male actors are also worth mentioning. Lan Qun's Qi Rude is sophisticated enough, and his performance is vivid and colorful. Luo Haochuan is a corrupt official, and Xue Jin's performance is full of official airs, which is a typical character. Song Hua's role as the younger brother Zhuo Ru is full of childishness, simply jumping out of the book. In addition, Zhang Fuxiang's Niu Dawang and Wang Jinfang's tea room are also not sloppy.

Naturally, shortcomings are also unavoidable. Although a group of young artists have tried it for the first time, they have gained something after all. I sincerely hope that they will not be complacent but strive for excellence.

### Wang Yuan Plays Shi Xiangyun

Miss Wang Yuan, a sprinter who caused a sensation across the country before the war with her fitness, returned to her hometown of Soochow University in Suzhou after graduating from the North American School. Not only are her grades excellent, but she was also selected as the "Sweetheart" of Gusu City. According to reliable sources, Miss Wang will play the role of Shi Xiangyun in "Dream of the Red Chamber" at the Hongbao Theatre. In school, a sweetheart loves to be naughty and joke, which is very suitable for Shi Xiangyun's personality. Moreover, Miss Wang's actions are lively and generous, she speaks a crisp and fluent Beijing dialect, and her healthy physique is full of plump curves. She will definitely have extraordinary success on the stage. In Shanghai, many friends are preparing to cheer for the "Fitness Queen"!

### Pinghua Tanci Amateur Performers Cross-Talk Storytelling

— Jian Fan

Amateur performers in Shanghai who like to study Pinghua and Tanci have organizations such as the Lian Zhu Society, Qing Ping Society, Amateur Tanci Research Association, and Silver Money Industry Friendship Association Tanci. They hire teachers to guide their research. Some are good at singing the opening chapter, some are good at telling Pinghua stories, and some can tell several episodes of Tanci such as "Xiao Zhenzhu Ta". "Starting roles," "throwing gimmicks," and "singing passages" are all complete. In the past, they often guested on various radio stations, with excellent results! Since private radio stations successively stopped broadcasting in order to save electricity, amateur Pinghua and Tanci performers have had no place to guest and have been depressed for a long time. Recently, a group of amateur Tanci and Pinghua performers, in order to raise funds to purchase summer medicines and distribute them to the poor, will hold a cross-talk storytelling session at Zhang Yuan Shuchang at 9:45 am on the 10th of this month (Sunday). Tickets are priced at 50 cents in national currency, and all proceeds from the sale of tickets will be used to purchase summer medicines for distribution in Zhang Yuan. Exciting programs: such as Gao Qiu Zhai singing "Yu Qing Ting," "An Tang Ren Mu" episode, plus the opening chapter, singing Zhou Yuquan's awkward tune, a few sentences are very realistic. Chen Jia Chi tells "Three Smiles of Marriage - Brother and Sister Reunion," imitating Xia He Sheng's fast playing and slow singing. Chen Shou Ying opens the "Sui and Tang Dynasties - Li Yuanba's Birth," roaring and full of momentum, which is not easy! In the last slot, Tanci famous amateur Qin Li Xiang sends off guests, exclusively telling "Zhenzhu Ta - Lu Qiuting Giving the Pagoda," singing the stacked sentence Ma tune in one breath. They are taking the stage for charity performances, which is a very fresh initiative!

### Notes on the Pear Garden

After the expiration of the contract between Huang Jin Rong and Li Shi Fang, it is heard that they will contact Ma Lian Liang and Li Yu Ru's Fufeng Society. Zhang E Yun may find it difficult to fulfill her promise for a while.

Li Ruchun has returned to Shanghai from Hankou and will apply for leave at the Gong Wu Tai.

Kun Dan Cao Hui Lin is approved to take the stage at the Da Wu Tai on the night of the 16th, playing a bubble opera, co-starring with Lin Shu Sen in "Xue Ban Gui and Wang Shen Chuan."

Song Luo Bao Shi arrived in Shanghai this month and will sing in the Ren Xin.

Kun Dan Zhang Wen Qin will get married the day after tomorrow (10th), and the wedding hall will be at the Dali Restaurant on Si Wei Road, thus leaving the singing stage.

Chen Mo Xiang, a famous playwright who once compiled private operas for the Four Great Dan, died of illness in his Bei Ping residence at the end of last month. His funeral was extremely desolate.

The old actor Shen Wen Bin was a famous teacher of the Qing Yi line and passed away in Shanghai a few days ago.

Artistic Vignettes

### Laurel and Hardy

— Fan Xing

Although Chaplin's comedic performances are regarded as "veiled satire" and receive higher evaluations, his "box office appeal" is actually not as good as Laurel and Hardy's, at least in Shanghai. Ladies and young ladies do not know what is called "implicit." Since "comedy" is advertised, as long as it has the power to make people laugh, that's enough. As for the gentlemen, they always take the opinions of the young ladies as their own. Therefore, Laurel and Hardy are more popular in Shanghai than Chaplin.

Objectively speaking, the acting skills of the two are not just blindly messing around. The small actions are full of gimmicks, which can only be achieved by outstanding genius. It is not to say that "the moon is better in other people's country." Their refined and natural acting skills are definitely not something that the so-called "Oriental Laurel and Hardy" can learn!

### Public Works Department Increases Entertainment Tax on Movies

The first-run movie theaters in this city have increased the entertainment tax levied by the Public Works Department to 30%. Therefore, the ticket prices in each theater are: the lowest for first-run theaters is two yuan, and the highest is six yuan; the ticket prices for second-run theaters are: the lowest is two yuan and the highest is three yuan. It is heard that the Majestic and Lido theaters have implemented this since the day before yesterday, the Nanjing Guotai will implement it from today, and the Da Guangming will be postponed until this Sunday.

### Recording the Chen Residence Party

The wedding of Chen Geng Jun and Ms. Yang Hui Qin was held the day before yesterday at the Fuxing Garden on Guangdong Road. Yu Wen Yin, the president of the Chang Society's amateur opera troupe, and the members of various societies performed Peking opera. The plays included Lin Han Zhu's "Herdboy Grazing Cattle," Ji Yuan Qiang's "Tian Dan Saves the Lord," Fu Yun Shi and Tian Jia Gu's "Lotus Lantern," Zheng Wei Shi's "Shooting the Halberd at Yuan Gate," Tang Huan Ru and Xie Chao Wei's "Zhen Cao Qiao," Lin Bo Xiong's "Night Battle of Ma Chao," Wang Yu Ying, Wang Ru Lin, and Gong Yuan Qiang's "Qiu Hu Teases His Wife," Lin Qin Yan and Zheng Wei Shi's "Mu Tian Wang," Wang Xi Qing, Zhang Shi Han, and Lin Qin Yan's "Sha Tuo Escorts the Treasure," Ding Wen Qin and Xie Ling Xiao's "Three Mothers Teaching the Son," Zhang Shi Han, Ji Yuan Qiang, Fu Yun Shi, Tian Jia Gu, and Wang Yong Qing's "Crossing the River to Attend the Banquet." All the performances were extremely wonderful. Especially Ms. Ding's Wang Chun E, whose singing was godlike, won the most applause.
