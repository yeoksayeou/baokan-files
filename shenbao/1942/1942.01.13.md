### Japanese Government Issues Statement: Commencing Operations Against the Dutch East Indies; Japanese Troops Land in Dutch Borneo; Fierce Battles Underway

Tokyo, December 12th (Domei News Agency) – The Japanese government, through the Information Bureau, issued a statement today, stating in brief: Although the Japanese government has already declared war on Britain and the United States, it has not taken hostile actions against the Netherlands to spare the people of the Dutch East Indies from the ravages of war. However, the Dutch government has presented a note to the Japanese government stating that, in view of Japan's hostile actions against Britain and the United States, and the close and inseparable relationship between the Netherlands, Britain, and the United States, a state of war exists between Japan and the Netherlands. Accordingly, while Japan harbors no animosity towards the innocent residents of the East Indies, the Japanese naval and land forces, in order to eliminate Dutch hostile actions and protect the lives and property of Japanese residents, commenced operations against the Dutch East Indies on the 11th of this month.

Tokyo, December 12th (Domei News Agency) – The Japanese government has recently explained the reasons for the Japanese military's attack on the Dutch East Indies. Responsible authorities tonight also detailed the hostile actions taken by the Dutch military against Japan as follows: On December 17th, Dutch aircraft attacked Japanese troops landing near Miri in British Borneo four times, but were repelled. Dutch submarines bombarded Japanese forces in Kuching, the capital of Sarawak, forcing the Japanese navy to take action, sinking Dutch ships and capturing crew members. Furthermore, on December 9th and 10th, Dutch submarines in the Malay Sea attacked Japanese escort vessels off the coast of Patani between Kota Bharu and Songkhla. Dutch submarines and aircraft also attempted to obstruct Japanese operations in Davao, Mindanao, in the Philippines. In addition, it has been confirmed that British aircraft squadrons are based at the Medan airfield in Sumatra, and Dutch aircraft based at airfields in northern Dutch Borneo are attempting to hinder Japanese military operations in the Philippines.

Tokyo, December 12th (Domei News Agency) – The Imperial General Headquarters announced this afternoon that Japanese forces have occupied Tarakan Island and Menado Harbor (Celebes Island) near the northeast coast of Dutch Borneo.

Batavia, December 12th (Havas News Agency) – The Dutch East Indies authorities issued a war report this morning stating that fighting continued yesterday in the Menado area of eastern Celebes. Japanese paratroopers and Dutch East Indies defense forces are engaged in fierce battles. A Dutch ship was bombed and strafed with machine guns by Japanese aircraft, and twenty injured sailors have arrived in Balikpapan, southeastern Borneo. Detailed reports on the Japanese attack on Tarakan Island and the resolute resistance of the Dutch forces have not yet been received. We lost one aircraft today. Several Dutch East Indies and American bombers are bombing in four locations in the Dutch East Indies.

Tokyo, December 12th (Domei News Agency) – A Dutch East Indies communiqué released in Batavia disclosed that a large Japanese transport fleet arrived near Tarakan Island on Saturday and began landing troops at night. That same night, Japanese forces also landed at three locations in northern Celebes. Japanese paratroopers also landed in various parts of northern Celebes. Dutch defenders have put up resistance.

Bangkok, December 12th (Haitong News Agency) – According to reports received here, after Japanese forces landed on Balikpapan Island off the northeast coast of Dutch Borneo, Dutch forces used aircraft and explosives to destroy oil storage tanks. It will take several months to a year to restore oil production after the destruction of these tanks.

Bangkok, December 12th (Haitong News Agency) – According to news from Batavia, the actions of Japanese forces within the territory of the Dutch East Indies have caused nationwide anxiety. The "Soerabaja Handelsblad" today called for urgent and effective assistance.

Saigon, December 12th (Haitong News Agency) – News from Batavia states that since Japanese forces landed in Tarakan in eastern Borneo and Menado in northern Celebes, the war has directly threatened the Dutch East Indies. Sources in the Dutch East Indies say that the Japanese landing there appears to serve three purposes: 1. The Japanese aim to implement their pincer encirclement plan from the south and expect to threaten Sumatra again. 2. Japan hopes to gain access to valuable oil reserves. 3. The Japanese military wants to interfere with the transportation of munitions from the United States to the Dutch East Indies, as their landing sites are extremely advantageous for this action. Batavian sources also expect that the Japanese may interfere with cargo ships bound for Java. It is expected that American convoys to the Dutch East Indies usually pass through the Strait of Malacca. If the Japanese succeed in landing in Menado and Tarakan, Allied supplies to the Dutch East Indies will face a significant aerial threat. If the Japanese complete their conquest, American ships will have to detour through Australia, taking several weeks longer. Dutch East Indies authorities say that the Tarakan defenders are currently putting up strong resistance, and the oil facilities have not yet been destroyed, indicating that the Dutch East Indies forces are still holding out. Japanese forces are still attacking Tarakan, and the city suffered heavy air raids yesterday morning. Japanese paratroopers are also participating in the fighting, which is noteworthy. Tarakan, located in eastern Borneo, is an important oil center that can supply various types of aircraft. Therefore, the Japanese occupation of this area would solve Japan's most urgent problem.

### A Brief History of the German Paratrooper Corps (Part 1)

One evening after a heavy storm, a German staff officer and I drove near Stendal, seventy miles east of Berlin. We heard the sound of an engine and looked up to see a Junkers Ju 52, a three-engine aircraft, flying low overhead. In today's Germany, this is a common sight, and the sound is not unusual. But before you get bored and look away, a strange scene unfolds in the dim twilight.

The plane was so low and close that you could see everything clearly. Seven strong men rolled out of the plane, carrying all kinds of luggage. Each person had an old-fashioned travel bag, an ancestral Bismarck-era blanket roll, and beautiful, fashionable goods.

It seemed that the descent of this group of paratroopers was like a suddenly appearing aerial garden, or that this group would be scattered by the strong wind in an instant. But the opposite was true, because although the soldiers swayed violently in the wind, they still skillfully steered and controlled their parachutes, and adjusted their rate of descent, so that they landed very close to each other. Looking at it, it was like a seven-petaled giant flower wilting from the sky.

A colonel said, "Today is Tuesday. They are back in camp after their Easter holiday."

German paratrooper schools have such a tradition, that is, at the end of the week, or at least when the number of people on vacation is quite large, parachutes can be used to send soldiers home from various places, that is, the ordinary training aircraft in the school are used to operate according to the prescribed schedule. Each plane carries soldiers grouped by region for convenience, like taxis going to and from the suburbs, which can take a few passengers living in the same area. The landing point is always as close as possible to each person's home. It is said that some soldiers have landed in the backyard of their homes. This makes it easy to close your eyes and imagine: a paratrooper floating in the air, slowly descending into the arena surrounded by big trees, seeing the little brothers on the ground, shouting loudly, "Gu Shi, run and tell Mom, to prepare dinner!"

The journey back to camp can also be taken by plane at nearby airports, but you must bring your own travel expenses. There are more than a thousand large and small airfields in Germany, so some soldiers only have to walk a short distance, and some can reach by bus, tram, or bicycle. Some areas, or those a little further from the airfield, use designated locations on the national highway as gathering points. At home, each person has re-folded the parachute, because when returning to school, they must also jump from the air.

A colonel said, "This method" is not only a publicity stunt for internal use, but also enough to arouse the interest of the local people, and naturally can receive the effect of mass communication. Paratroopers are a novelty in the eyes of the elderly, and an enviable thing in the eyes of young people. He is bound to be surrounded and questioned everywhere, and he is bound to be a good salesman for public education.

"But the most important purpose of this method is entirely in training, and there is indeed a meticulous plan in advance. It is not just to show generosity or consideration to the soldiers, but a reasonable part of the school course. Parachutes were originally not a common sight for ordinary soldiers, at most they were treated like a circus, but now, they have become their personal daily necessities. If someone wants to go home by other means, it is not prohibited, but although it is not forced, they still rush to ask for a ride on the plane. It was the school's hope that this method would be promoted naturally. In other words, they should treat the parachute as a correct and useful tool, use it very skillfully, and almost be indifferent.

"Giving soldiers leave with parachutes not only increases the time they spend at home, but also allows many people to reach home in a short vacation, because those who travel longer distances often cannot do so with land transportation. This method of transport by parachute is becoming more and more popular. Moreover, railways and other land transportation lines urgently need to transport food and equipment, mixed with soldiers returning home on leave, making them more crowded. This method can also relieve some of the tension. This method is also a win-win situation for training: one is that the driver can get training in identifying and aiming at the target to drop the paratroopers; the other is that the paratroopers can be used as part of the jumping practice, which is an essential stage in training for correct landing!"

The colonel then frankly spoke about the brief history of the formation of their paratrooper unit:

"The lessons learned from 1914 to 1918, the defensive works of trenches and machine gun emplacements, have made the old tactics without large-scale activities and applications impossible. This kind of war only wastes manpower, resources, and time completely, and there is still no possibility of military victory. It seems that there is hope for opening up a new path only in air combat; but how exactly to use it?

"Old-fashioned military strategists often stubbornly adhere to their prejudices, thinking that airplanes are just a new weapon, and the air force is only an auxiliary to the navy and army. Those who are keen on reform think that the power of the air force is above everything else, which is also wrong. The development of imperialism originally depended on sea power, so naval veterans insisted that only naval power could control water transportation. People in the army also said that air power alone could never win, because to conquer an enemy country, it must actually occupy its land.

"The Italians were shocked by the fame of General Douhet, and the Russians were misled by the needs of the terrain and the lack of land transportation, and blindly devoted all their efforts to operating air vehicles. However, neither country had the appropriate industrial capacity, nor the engineering and research talent to complete this large-scale experiment. Italy also lacked the necessary resources and wealth. As a result, they had gone too far astray, and it was too late to take a compromise solution. (To be continued)

The method of dyeing fingers for retail sales will be implemented on a trial basis starting today. The Municipal Council's Rice and Grain Office continued to allocate a large amount of foreign rice from its warehouses to various rice shops yesterday, issuing more than 200 transport permits, with quantities ranging from 20 to 50 bags. It was still designated to be released from Roosevelt, Donglai, Hufeng, China, and other warehouses, totaling about five to six thousand bags.

Jincheng Warehouse to be unsealed today

The Municipal Council's Rice and Grain Management Committee has also agreed with the Japanese side to unseal the Jincheng Warehouse on Gansu Road today. The rice shops in the north of the Huangpu River are designated to pick up foreign rice from China Warehouse and Jincheng Warehouse, the rice shops in the French Concession from Roosevelt Warehouse, and the rice shops in the International Settlement from Donglai Warehouse and Hufeng Warehouse.

Disposition of rice stored in closed rice shops

The total price is still under negotiation. A total of more than 700 rice shops have been ordered to close this time. It is learned that most of the rice shops have been ordered to stop operating and are waiting for the authorities to properly handle the matter. However, a small number of rice shops are still selling rice in secret and allowing citizens to buy a large amount of rice, but only opening side doors or back doors. It is now learned that the police stations of the French Concession have dispatched a large number of detectives to the rice shops, instructing them to return their old business licenses and issue new ones. All rice shops must show their new licenses when detectives come to inspect them in the future, otherwise they will be severely punished.

Methods for selling subsidized rice in the southwestern district of Shanghai

### Flatbread and Fried Dough Sticks at Current Prices Starting Today; Limited Production of Fried Dough Sticks; The Ratio of Production Numbers for the Two Foods is Set at Five to One

Starting today (the 13th), the International Settlement and the French Concession will limit the prices of flatbread, fried dough sticks, and Shandong-style baked flatbreads. This is the most important step taken by the authorities since limiting the price of machine-made noodles.

Flour warehouses to be opened across the board

At the same time, it is said that the Japanese side has agreed to immediately open all the flour warehouses in the International Settlement to fully support the Municipal Council's control of flour. The flour situation in the city is very satisfactory. If flour is purchased at a price higher than that set by the authorities, then the fault lies with the citizens themselves.

Both weight and quantity are limited

It is said that the limited price of flatbread is one jiao (1/10 of a yuan) each, and the weight of every thirteen must not be less than one jin (approx. 500g). The limited price of fried dough sticks is also one jiao, and the weight of every eighteen must not be less than one jin. The limited price of baked flatbread is one yuan and twenty-five fen (1/100 of a yuan) per jin. Fried dough sticks are more expensive than flatbread, so shops selling these foods should limit the number of fried dough sticks produced to one-fifth of the number of flatbreads baked. The authorities hope that all citizens will cooperate to conserve food for the people. Any shop found to be violating the price limits will be severely punished.

Approximately 3,000 bags of flour are used daily

It is found that the Fried Dough Stick and Flatbread Industry Association has a total of 1,600 to 700 members, who use approximately 3,000 bags of flour per day, accounting for one-third of the total flour consumption in the wood market. In other words, the flour used by the fried dough stick and flatbread industries and the machine-made noodle industry accounts for approximately two-thirds of the total flour consumption in the city. The price limit for flatbread, etc., is one of the three most important actions taken by the Municipal Council's Price Management Office. The other two are limiting the price of noodles and rice. The Municipal Council also has a limited number of supervisors and cannot investigate flour shops every day, so citizens must protect their own interests. If they encounter refusal to sell or price increases, they must report it. Furthermore, an official from the French Concession Municipal Council recently stated that the French Municipal Council's opinion on limiting the price of flatbread and fried dough sticks is completely consistent with that of the Municipal Council, so this price limit will apply to both concessions at the same time.

### Public Livelihood Simple Cafeteria Initiated to Cook and Sell Cooked Rice

Since the food in this city has been managed by the authorities of the two concessions, hoarders have no way to manipulate it, and the selling price can be balanced, which is of great benefit to the citizens. Recently, the Municipal Council has advocated group cooking in order to save fuel. Several households gather together to set up a meal and cook together. It can save part of the fuel, but Shanghai is densely populated, and people from all directions are mixed together. Now, it is really easy to cause disputes to unite residents who are not familiar with each other at once and cook together. It is difficult to implement. It is learned that Ling Youguang of Minsheng Simple Canteen intends to expand and promote the Municipal Council's proposal for group cooking. Based on the principle of centralized mass production, a large amount of cooked rice is cooked and sold at a fair price, which can save fuel and avoid the trouble of group cooking. However, Mr. Ling, with rice and coal, is regularly managed, and has recently drafted a plan and submitted it to the authorities of the two concessions for approval. Once approved, this convenient and economical rice cooking for the people will be seen in the society.

### Fierce Dogs in Caohejing Cause Havoc and Bite Two People to Death

At about 10:00 p.m. the night before, two young villagers, a man and a woman, both around 17 or 18 years old, suddenly died together on the Caohe Road side behind Huang's Garden. They were discovered by passers-by who immediately reported the incident. After investigation, it was found that the throats of the deceased were covered in blood and flesh. It was clear that the two were walking at night and were bitten by fierce dogs, causing them to die from severed throats.

### Whether British-Owned Public Buses Will Continue to Run is Undetermined; All Sectors Hope for Restoration in the Short Term; Trolleybuses in Both Concessions Maintain Normal Service

An important official of the Political Section of the International Settlement Police Department stated (on the 12th) this morning that the British-owned China General Omnibus Company has laid off 2,600 employees starting from January 11th. It has not yet been possible to ascertain from the company whether public buses will resume running in the International Settlement. However, well-informed sources believe that the layoffs indicate that public buses will be suspended for a long period of time. The British-owned public buses have been suspended since the 11th, which has had a major impact on traffic. All sectors hope that services will be restored as soon as possible. However, British-owned trolleybuses are still running. According to the trolleybus company, trolleybuses on Nanjing Road run until 11:00 p.m. every night, with the last trolleybus leaving the Bund at 10:30 p.m. However, after 9:00 p.m., the number of trolleybuses on the Nanjing Road line will be slightly reduced. Trolleybuses on other lines stop running at 9:00 p.m. every night. Public buses and trolleybuses on the French Concession side operate normally every day from 7:00 a.m. to 9:30 p.m.

### Impersonation and Extortion

The doctors Lu Chunyang and Lu Xiaoyang, father and son, have a clinic at No. 114 Weihaiwei Road. At 11:50 a.m. the day before yesterday, an uninvited guest suddenly came and accused the Lu father and son of privately hiding 100 gallons of gasoline. He claimed that he was ordered to come and search and intended to extort 400 yuan. Lu Xiaoyang realized that he was a fake and called the police to arrest him. He was taken to the Chengdu Road Police Station. The detective learned that his name was Xu Rongxiang and went to Room 202 of the Jincheng Hotel at No. 570 Hankou Road to arrest his accomplices, Zhang Yiyang, Wang Genbo, and Zhou Jianqiu, along with a piece of official document. They were all taken to the police station and detained. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Criminal Division II of the First Special Court. The police lawyer Zhang Tianyin filed a lawsuit according to law. After interrogation by Judge Fu, he ordered the five defendants to be detained pending further investigation and verification.

### Bitterly Cold Yesterday; 2.5 Degrees Below Freezing

Since the snowfall the day before yesterday, the temperature in this port fell to 1.3 degrees Celsius below freezing. Yesterday, the bitter cold did not subside, and the temperature fell to 2.5 degrees Celsius below freezing. The ditches were frozen into ice, but the sunshine was warm, making the winter days lovely. Also, yesterday, in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, such as Hankou, Jiujiang, Nanjing, and other places, the snow stopped and the sky cleared, and the bitter cold was even worse than in Shanghai.

### Female Painter Zhu Shengying Donates Proceeds from Artwork to Support Education; Total Donations Amount to 50,000 Yuan

Total donations exceed 50,000 yuan since the launch of this newspaper's second session of student aid, the total amount of donations has exceeded 50,000 yuan. Yesterday, a letter was received from Ms. Zhu Shengying, a female painter from Jing County, Anhui Province: "Shengying will donate 774 yuan and 2 jiao, the sale price of the works displayed at the New World Company's Female Calligraphy and Painting Exhibition, to Shen Bao's student aid fund. Please check and accept." Also, Mr. Shen Fengbiao, a waiter at the Continental Hotel, has been donating 20 yuan per month since the first session and has continued to send it to this day. Such commendable behavior is truly rare. As of December 12th of this month, the following student aid donations have been received: Ms. Zhu Shengying, 774 yuan and 2 jiao; a clerk from Yuanchang Pawnshop, 20 yuan; Cao Binghong, 10 yuan; Wu Jinren, 10 yuan; totaling 814 yuan and 2 jiao. Previously deposited 49,440 yuan, 8 jiao and 2 fen, totaling 50,250 yuan and 2 fen.

### Worker Jumps from Building and Attempts Suicide

At around 4:50 p.m. yesterday, on the highest floor of the Tianyunlou amusement park in the Wing On Company on Nanjing Road, a tourist, about 30 years old, wearing a cloth jacket and trousers, resembling a worker, for some reason, had a sudden thought and jumped from the building to commit suicide. He was barely breathing. He was later reported to the police, who sent him to Renji Hospital for treatment by car.

### HSBC and Nine Other Banks Reopen; Resume Paying Deposits; Second Batch of Withdrawal Methods to be Announced This Week; Expected to be Paid Through Clearing Banks

Nine Allied banks in this city, under the special calculation of the Japanese authorities, reopened yesterday morning to pay limited amounts of cash to individual depositors and savings account holders. The four American commercial banks were all among those that reopened, as were the two Dutch banks, one Belgian bank, and the two major British financial institutions, HSBC and Mercantile Bank.

Withdrawal procedures were extremely fast yesterday

When the banks opened at 10:00 a.m. yesterday, a number of depositors were lined up in front of them waiting to withdraw money. However, they were no longer visible after a while, as the banks had previously checked the depositors' accounts and marked the amount to be paid. Therefore, the payment was quite fast yesterday morning. The new withdrawal restriction method was to allow the first batch of deposits of 2,000 yuan to be withdrawn from December 6th of last year. Therefore, what the banks paid to depositors yesterday morning was the outstanding amount that had not yet reached 2,000 yuan. For example, if a depositor had withdrawn 1,500 yuan since December 6th, he could still receive 500 yuan yesterday morning. However, the first withdrawal amount of Chase Bank was limited to 1,000 yuan. All depositors who had withdrawn 2,000 yuan yesterday morning were unable to continue withdrawing cash.

Second batch of withdrawals expected to begin

The Japanese liquidators of the Allied banks are expected to announce their decision on the second batch of withdrawals this week, so that depositors who have withdrawn 2,000 yuan (1,000 yuan for Chase Bank) from the Allied banks can continue to withdraw cash. However, the excess amount withdrawn in the past few months will be deducted from the second batch of withdrawals. For example, if a depositor has withdrawn 3,000 yuan, 1,000 yuan will be deducted from his second batch of withdrawals. The Japanese liquidators of the Allied banks continued to investigate the deposit and cash situation yesterday morning in preparation for deciding on the method for the second batch of withdrawals. The banking industry expects that the payment of the second batch of deposits will be handled by the Japanese banks clearing the Allied banks. The foreign exchange rate in the exchange shops in the central district yesterday morning rose slightly compared to last Saturday, apparently affected by the reopening of the Allied banks.

### Thief Tied Up in Courtyard Freezes to Death

At around 1:00 a.m. the day before yesterday, a thief named Fu Hequan, 34 years old, from Hangzhou, broke into No. 689 Peikai'er Road with the intention of stealing. He was caught by the watchmen Zhao Hehai and Xu Asheng, both from Shaoxing, who tied Fu up with a thin rope in the courtyard. After about three hours, Fu froze to death due to the severe cold weather. The Yulin Road Police Station learned of the incident and sent detective Wu Wenfa to send Fu's body to the morgue for examination and detained Zhao and Xu at the police station. They were sent to the Criminal Division II of the First Special Court yesterday morning. After interrogation, they were ordered to be detained pending further verification of the body.

Yesterday, this newspaper was dispatched at 6:35

### Negotiations underway for foreign rice supply; closure of rice shops causes infighting

There is said to be a glimmer of hope for foreign rice trading. According to grain industry sources, the rice stocks in various ports of Vietnam are very sufficient. In addition to a portion that has already been controlled by the Japanese side, there is currently a surplus of 200,000 tons of medium-grade goods and broken rice around Saigon, which should be transported to Shanghai. It is said that the Japanese company Mitsui is responsible for requesting transportation passports from Tokyo. In terms of shipping, it will be discussed with the French Shipping Company to dispatch ships. It is currently underway in various aspects. If this move becomes a reality, then the people's food problem in this city will be more stable. It is also rumored that the grain industry's frozen funds are also being negotiated, and there is hope for circulation soon.

The demand for national rice yesterday was strong for both shopkeepers and food consumers. The early market once saw a firm stance, but the sources also appeared to be increasing. In addition to the more than 200 bags newly arrived in the market, peddling along the streets of the two concessions was particularly endless. Peddling prices along the way have been reduced to less than 200 yuan, so the market has repeatedly firmed and weakened. The arrival of negative yuan is particularly weak in consumption, and the price has continued to decline by one or two yuan. Other types of japonica rice also seem to be in the process of weakening. Kunshan special japonica was sold at 233 yuan to 230 yuan, early rice at 211 yuan to 07 yuan per ox, late rice at 208 yuan and a half to 07 yuan. Unified market transactions also had a spectrum of 200 bags. Although the number of negative yuan was small, there were few destinations, resulting in a depreciation of two or three yuan, sold at 203 yuan and 02 yuan and a half. Wuhu rice was subsidized for sale in the Nanshi area, and the population registration has been opened as usual for the past two days, so there is absolutely no difficulty in selling rice or an unbearable congestion in the city.

After the Municipal Council announced the reduction in the issuance of rice, the remaining rice shops included 250 in the International Settlement and 132 in the French Concession. A total of 434 rice shops in the two concessions were closed. Once these rice shops are closed, their livelihoods will be cut off. For this reason, there is a move to apply to the Standing Bureau. However, it is heard that because the list of remaining rice shops and closed rice shops was announced without convening the industry peers to handle it fairly, the two sides mutually attacked each other, thinking that the rice shops set up by the main members of the industry are all selling rice, which is not without suspicion. Moreover, it is related to the livelihood and interests of the public in the industry. Even if some rice shops want to be closed, it is appropriate for the authorities to draw lots in public to decide. It should not be controlled by a few people in the industry to arbitrarily determine whether they should be opened or closed. As a result, those who are closed are unhappy and question the person in charge of the industry, and then they shirk each other, using public affairs for private gain, which makes the knowledgeable feel cold.

### Selling on Highs, Buying on Lows: The Gold Market Meanders

The cash market is sluggish and obscure. There were still four trading sessions, but the range of fluctuations was narrow, and the price presented a meandering situation. Two gold shops sold when prices were high and bought when they were low. People's hearts are still stable. From the morning, each bar (ten taels) initially tended to stabilize. The first transaction price has risen to 11,700 yuan, which is 250 yuan higher. A certain silver shop, a money exchange, and a certain cash shop bought in. The highest transaction was 30 taels at 11,800 yuan. Another cash shop, Gonghe, and a securities firm sold out. A certain gold shop also sold, and the market immediately fell by 450 yuan to 11,350 yuan. Ten taels were traded at this price. Yu Taifeng and a certain gold shop absorbed at low prices, raising it to 11,600 yuan. Finally, another gold shop sold. At noon, it was 11,450 yuan, the same as the price after Saturday morning last week. There was a difference of 450 yuan that day, with about a thousand taels traded. Silver shops, jewelry shops, Daxin, and their counterparts still quoted 1,250 yuan per tael for outgoing exchange (incoming reduced by 200 yuan). Patterned silver still quoted 16 yuan per tael, with buyers in the black market at 11.5 yuan.

The foreign currency market was quite calm. British and American gold pounds remained at their original prices, the former at 270 yuan, the latter at 275 yuan. US dollar bills initially traded at 17.2 yuan, then at 17.1 yuan, slightly stronger than last weekend. Hong Kong dollar bills retreated slightly to 2.5 yuan for buying and 2.7 yuan for selling. Military scrip continued to rise to 3.92 yuan.

### Government Bonds Plunge, Foreign Stocks Also Fall

The off-exchange black market for government bonds suddenly turned reactionary, plummeting by eight or nine jiao to 1.4 yuan because it was reported that the interest on the twelfth issue would need to be collected in Chongqing, and Shanghai would no longer pay it. Previous hopes had been cut off. People's hearts were therefore full, and many floating shares were released. This was naturally expected, and the future is still very bleak. Type A bonds fell from 68.3 yuan to 7 yuan, closing at 8 yuan inside the customs. Type B bonds were at 64 yuan and 4.3 yuan. Type C bonds were at 63.4 yuan, later seeing 3.6 yuan, but because Hongda, Tongyi, and Houda bravely released shares, the small price saw 62.5 yuan. With Tongshen, Tongkang, and Qianyi buying, the appetite was still strong, and it rebounded to 3.05 yuan. Type E reached a high price of 62 yuan, falling to 60.08 yuan, closing at 61 yuan. Type D has broken 60 yuan. The market has not yet opened, and the turnover is about 700,000 to 800,000 yuan.

Yesterday, the off-exchange black market for foreign stocks at the Public Chamber of Commerce saw a resurgence in trading. Prices rose less and fell more. Jardine Matheson sellers again shouted for a high price of 62 yuan. Ewo Cotton Mill's buying and selling prices remained at 25 or 26 yuan. Sino-British was strong at 6 yuan. China Textile had buyers at 9 yuan. China General Edison sellers still shouted for 30 yuan. Yeguang was at 13.4 yuan, British American Tobacco at 19.5 yuan, Jardine Brewery at 6 yuan, Ken Zhi at 21 yuan, Xiangtai Timber at 30 yuan, and Paper Industry at 5.5 yuan, all with supply but no demand. Asia Navigation fell to 9 yuan, Langelands at 15 yuan (some said only around 12 yuan), and Kalundans at 1.23 yuan. The rest were said to have no prices.

### Cotton Yarn Turns from Weak to High, Japanese Yarn Sales Especially Strong

The cotton yarn market initially weakened and then rose, but the trend is still soft with some firmness. However, most of the current yarn transactions on this street are Japanese yarn. The gold situation is also on the horizontal line, so people's hearts are stable. The 20-count Double Horse opened in the morning, affected by the previous day's false air. Most were bearish. Before the opening, everyone shouted wildly for 1,610 yuan, but there were few sellers. The first transaction price was 1,710 yuan, and soon it rose to 765 yuan. At this time, short sellers rose slightly, struggling slightly between 50 yuan. Before long, it was heard that gold was firm, and buying voices suddenly vibrated, but transactions were not smooth. It gradually rose to 1,915 yuan. Subsequently, profit-takers sold out, suddenly falling back to 1,785 yuan. Finally, it recovered to close well at 1,835 yuan, up 90 yuan from the previous day. The 20-count Blue Flag was called at 4,160 yuan to 4,080 yuan, 20-count Yueqin at 2,260 yuan to 2,290 yuan, 20-count Blue Phoenix at 2,550 yuan, 20-count Double Globe at 2,005 yuan, 20-count Tiannv at 2,650 yuan to 2,730 yuan, 18-count Weaver Girl at 1,990 yuan, and 14-count Golden Pagoda at 1,750 yuan.

### Cotton Cloth Lacks Spot Goods

Yesterday, the cloth market still had a tight supply of spot goods, and selling prices remained firm. 16-pound Huadie coarse cloth was shouted for 114 yuan, Double Elephant 108 yuan, 11-pound Three Rabbits 77.5 yuan, and 9-pound Five Blessing Cat Eagle 67.5 yuan, but all lacked spot goods. Therefore, Jardine coarse cloth only traded a dozen bales of 13-pound Flying Bear at 85 yuan. Others, such as 16-pound Flying Swan at 88 yuan, 11-pound New Character at 73.5 yuan, and 8-pound Zhenzhong at 55.75 yuan, saw about a hundred or so transactions on this street.

Eastern Cloth: The market atmosphere was sluggish. Yesterday, the Longtou fine cloth factory's early morning opening was around 89 yuan. The noon closing fell to 88.25 yuan. In the aftermarket, due to retail sales, it fell to 87.5 yuan. The closing price fell by 1.25 yuan per piece compared to last week. The mid-range trend was still stable, with each piece being pulled down by 7.5 jiao to 1 yuan. Fine cloth such as Caiqiu Yanghe closed late at 84.75 yuan. There were few transactions of fine twill, and Baobei twill was still shouted at 81.5 yuan. The new order for Sijunzi Serge opened at 3.205 yuan, then quickly fell. The noon closing was 3.18 yuan, and the late closing fell to 3.155 yuan, a decline of 4.5 fen.

### Persimmon Cakes See Rebound - Seafood Wholesale Stalls -

Persimmon cakes rose again as exchange rates tightened, and there were rumors that Taikoo and Jardine would resume shipping. People's hearts turned to Guipi and prices rose. Yesterday's market price for Geng cakes was 140 yuan, boxed Pai cakes 125 yuan, and Qing cakes 110 yuan to 100 yuan, rising by more than 30 yuan. Although the arrival of various seafood products has been quiet recently, the bottom stocks are still considered abundant, but most of the wholesale routes have stalled, and only local retail transactions have been made. Therefore, the trend is weak. The current market price for dried scallops is 1,500 yuan, dried shrimp 560 yuan, squid 1,000 yuan, western dried shrimp 360 yuan, golden hook shrimp 1,400 yuan, Tianbian shrimp tails 1,300 yuan, Jiangbei shrimp tails 700 yuan, and black pepper 300 yuan.

### Candles Sold Out in Retail Shops

Cigarette buying prices, which once fell sharply last week, still tended to rise yesterday. For example, the price per box of Great Britain brand was 4,900 yuan, Old Knife brand 4,250 yuan, Pin Hai Pi 4,000 yuan, Wuhua brand 3,150 yuan, Little Fairy 3,150 yuan, 50-piece Big Cannon 11,850 yuan per 10,000, Beautiful Middle Box 2,400 yuan, and Golden Mouse brand 1,620 yuan. Sales of daily necessities are trending downward, and the market atmosphere is stable. Phoenix brand is estimated at 1,460 yuan, Baixiangmao soap at 79 yuan. Candles have no formal market price because most stores have sold out.

### Students in Suffering and Hesitation

— Ya Xi

After December 8th, Shanghai—this international metropolis—underwent tremendous changes internally. Leaving aside other things for the moment, just the "out-of-school" craze alone is truly like "terrifying waves, pouring out for ten miles" and cannot be stopped.

Most schools (referring to secondary schools)? In the past week, those that have closed have closed, those that have suspended classes have suspended classes, and those that have disbanded have disbanded. Only a few remain, and their future is also in a state of "unstable wavering." In short, the schools on the isolated island have closed, and it is not known when classes will resume? For those still operating, the future is also unpredictable. What will these hundreds of thousands of students do after this sudden change? As far as the author knows, I would like to give a brief report here.

Many students originally came from the interior. At this time of expensive rice and firewood, of course, "small changes" are made to live in Shanghai. Therefore, a day or two after the school closed, they had already returned home to spend the New Year.

As for the other part of young students staying in Shanghai? Their lives are truly in "suffering and hesitation." Since they are not studying, they certainly cannot stay at home and eat "idle rice." So, many people want to break into the workplace, but who knows that the "unemployment" craze is also surging turbulently, disbanding, laying off employees,... Moreover, there are only a few rice bowls left. There are countless people who are "more qualified," "more savvy," "better educated," "more experienced," and "have bigger feet" than them. Where are there any extra rice bowls left for you?

Some people in school who like to dabble in writing may want to "sell their writing." But "selling writing" is not an easy task either? There are many cultural people on the isolated island, and many publications have been discontinued one after another. The few remaining thin publications have also "tightened their pages" due to "Luoyang paper being expensive."

If "jobs" cannot be found and "articles" cannot be sold, and one cannot eat "idle rice," then a large number of people will enter the ranks of cheap rice sales. However, since ancient times, it has been said, "A scholar is useless in a hundred ways," and "A scholar has no strength to bind a chicken." There are many strong young students, but there are also quite a few who are "bookish." Therefore, "stepping on someone's foot and shouting 'Mommy'" is also a powerful tone in the symphony of cheap rice sales. What is mentioned above, of course, refers to those from poor families. Although the more affluent ones have no material oppression, "not being able to study" is ultimately a great spiritual suffering. A Western proverb says, "Schools, books, teachers are only your help. True education still lies in your own efforts to self-study." I hope these young people will firmly believe in the true meaning of this saying.

Let me talk again about those playboys and modern young ladies who indulge in extravagance. They are not worthy of being called "students" at all. Before, they were just using "studying as a guise." Now, of course, it is a great opportunity given by heaven to seek excitement!

### Recent Events in the Factory

— Lin Feng

On the morning of December 27th last year, a trainee from the distribution office sent a handwritten note from the general manager. After the factory director read it, he clipped it under the glass plate. So everyone waited for an opportunity to take a peek, one by one. The handwritten note read like this:

"To maintain the livelihood of this factory and the majority of its employees, it is unavoidable to decide to dismiss twenty employees. The list is attached. Please complete the procedures before the end of the year. To Factory Director × of this factory. General Manager ×× personally opened."

The end of the year has passed, and the fate of the twenty employees has been determined. As usual, there is no room for accommodation. However, in this year, it is impossible to live in Shanghai, and of course there is no food waiting for you in the countryside. The severance pay of thirty yuan is probably not even enough for travel expenses. So, in the past two days, the engineering department has been in an uproar. You ask for this, he asks for that. For example, an apprentice surnamed Mao, who is only fourteen years old, had such a conversation with the factory director:

"We came to Shanghai to learn a living because there is no food to eat in our hometown. If we go back, we will starve to death."

"Now the factory cannot maintain itself, and the goods produced have no sales. Now you still have thirty yuan for travel expenses. In the future, I am afraid there will not even be a copper plate! Closing the door, you will have to wander in Shanghai as a beggar."

"Sir, thank you. Such a big factory will not miss one more person like me. If there is porridge in the factory, I will eat some porridge. If there is soup, I will drink some soup. I am willing not to have my monthly salary. I am willing to work night shifts every day. Sir, I beg you, please show mercy!"

"I have no choice. This is the order of the general manager. You must leave the factory within three days, otherwise..."

"Sir, I bow to you, I beg you..." Saying this, he knelt down and cried loudly. An old steward led him out. Another one came in, and the requests were mostly the same with minor differences.

Now eight days have passed, and twenty employees have already stepped out of the factory gate. As I end this short article, I wonder where they are going!

### Broken Ticket Issue: Donation of $2.40 for Scholarship with Receipt Stored at Reception

Yesterday, this publication received a letter from Mr. Zheng Shao-huang, who wrote about a conflict caused by a tram conductor refusing to accept old and torn legal tender, which was resolved by two passengers on the same tram who exchanged the money and paid the fare for him. Mr. Zheng, in his haste to get off the tram, did not have time to ask for the names of these two Good Samaritans, so he entrusted this publication with twice the amount of the exchanged money ($1) and the fare ($0.20)—$2.40 in total—to be donated to the readers' scholarship fund in this newspaper as a blessing for the two people. The receipt is now stored at the reception desk, and Mr. Zheng is welcome to come and pick it up.

This publication has repeatedly discussed the disputes between tram conductors and passengers. Although we did not witness the "conflict" mentioned by Mr. Zheng, it is not difficult to imagine it. Now that the public buses have stopped running, how long the happiness of riding the tram can last is also a job issue for the conductors. Please do not "cause conflicts" over minor disputes!

At the same time, the rejection of old and torn legal tender has now indeed spread throughout the city, and the picking is excessive. There are many disputes between income and expenditure. In fact, as long as it is not too tattered or the patterns and characters are blurred, wouldn't it be the same if everyone passed it around? (Editor)

### Cantonese Opera

— Ze Fu

Cantonese opera is commonly known as "gong and drum opera" or "grand opera" in Guangzhou. Its origins lie in Han opera, mixed with Qinqiang opera. Therefore, it is similar to Beijing opera, also having Erhuang, Xipi, and Bangzi melodies. However, the singing method uses pure dialect, so it is also very different from Beijing opera. The plays performed are mostly adapted from Han opera, half historical and half based on novels, such as "Huarong Road," "Xue Rengui," and "Waiting for the Moon in the West Chamber." However, since the early Republic of China, Cantonese opera has undergone major changes. The playwrights (called "play-opening masters" by Cantonese people) adapted and created new plays to cater to the trend of the times. These new plays, except for a few that are historical, are mostly romantic comedies between men and women, with rather strange play titles, such as "Ah! I Was Wrong," "A Perfect Couple of Soldiers," "Where Did This Child Come From? Ask My Wife," and "Forcibly Assaulting the Desire for Drama." Moreover, small tunes are mixed in when singing, no longer following the rules and regulations as in the past, so they are not appreciated by many knowledgeable people. As for the roles in Cantonese opera (commonly known as "lao guan"), the clown and the glamorous Dan are the most important. The clown is like the scholarly and martial Laosheng in Beijing opera. It is said to have originated with Ma Shizeng, because he is good at being funny when performing. The glamorous Dan is the Huadan. There is also a painted-face Laosheng, commonly known as "gong jiao," which is not found in other operas. In addition to Chinese musical instruments, Western musical accompaniment has also been added in recent years, which is also unheard of in other operas.

According to his own plan, he and two classmates had rescued the singing girl once, and had some grace: When they met for the second time, they would naturally be able to get close easily.

Who knew that he went to Shou Ronghua alone and waited for two nights, but he did not wait for Mei Bao's shadow.
