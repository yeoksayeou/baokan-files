### German Forces Employ Pincer Movement to Besiege Stalingrad, German Forces in Caucasus Engage in Mountain Warfare, Soviet Forces Launch Counteroffensive in Kaluga Region

Reuters report from Bear City, 24th: German tank forces today threatened Stalingrad from two directions, with one point only 40 miles from this Volga city. German forces are gradually tightening a pincer attack on this Soviet tank manufacturing city from both the north and south. A large number of German troops have already crossed the Don River in the north.

Reuters report from Berlin, 24th: The German High Command announced last night that German forces have launched a new offensive southwest of Kaluga (located on the Moscow-Bryansk railway), 110 miles southwest of Moscow, to coordinate with the offensive in the Orel area, 200 miles south of Moscow. German forces have broken into strong Soviet positions within the Kaluga region, and Red Army counterattacks have been repelled.

Havas report from Berlin, 24th: The German High Command announced this morning that in the Caucasus, German forces, together with allied forces, launched an offensive yesterday and are now engaged in fierce fighting in the mountains. Northwest of Stalingrad, German infantry and motorized units, under air cover, have crossed the Don River and broken through strong enemy lines, advancing forward. Southwest of Kaluga and near Rzhev, enemy counterattacks have been repelled. Yesterday alone, 157 Soviet aircraft were shot down in aerial combat, and 9 were shot down by anti-aircraft guns. German aircraft losses were only 8.

Havas report from Berlin, 23rd: Military sources report that the major battle on the Eastern Front is currently taking place in the Caucasus and near the Volga River. Soviet forces are sparing no effort to hinder the German advance, and there will be no more strategic retreats in the future. Soviet forces along the Black Sea coast are doing their utmost to prevent the German forces from occupying the ports of Anapa, Novorossiysk, and Tuapse, as the Soviets are using these ports to evacuate their garrison south of the Kuban River. The German forces, disregarding the scorching heat and heavy rain, are continuing their advance. On the western and central fronts of the Caucasus, progress has been slow due to dense forests, few roads, and buried landmines, making movement difficult. German forces have requested reinforcements from Alpine mountain troops to prepare for mountain warfare. Soviet forces are also putting up fierce resistance in the lower reaches of the Kuban River, but since the German forces occupied Kuskaya and Klyuchevaya, Soviet resistance has been failing, and German forces have advanced another 20 miles. According to official announcements, from August 1st to 21st, German aircraft sank one Soviet destroyer, twenty-two coastal patrol ships, one 4,000-ton freighter, and twelve other ships, totaling 16,700 tons. In addition, two destroyers, five transport ships, and eight coastal patrol ships and small vessels were damaged.

Havas report from Berlin, 23rd: Official sources here recently released a war report stating that the German Air Force was extremely active on the Eastern Front yesterday, successfully assisting the army in bombing enemy communication lines and concentration points. A summary of the situation on each front is as follows: On the Caucasus front, German Stuka dive bombers broke through Soviet resistance and destroyed several enemy convoys. In the Volga River, German aircraft sank four Soviet oil tankers and one small freighter. On the Don River front, the German Air Force assisted the army in battle, inflicting heavy damage on the enemy. On the Rzhev front, German fighter planes shot down 59 enemy aircraft. East of Vyazma, four trains loaded with goods were destroyed by German air force bombing. Yesterday alone, the Soviets lost 125 aircraft, while only four German aircraft were missing.

### Stalin Personally Commands Front Lines, Exerts Maximum Effort to Defend Vital Volga City

Havas report from Stockholm, 24th: The situation around Stalingrad resembles that of the Moscow area in November of last year. At that time, Moscow was under attack from both the north and south, and Soviet troops defended it to the death. Stalin, as he is today, personally commanded the battle. However, in the battle for Moscow, Soviet troops successfully defended the city, thanks to the help of the weather, as the German forces were unprepared for the winter cold and had to retreat. Now, winter is still far away, and the fighting conditions are not as muddy as in Moscow. This is the difference. In addition, the Stalingrad area is experiencing scorching heat and intermittent rain, which is exhausting both sides in terms of energy and stamina. This may be a major factor in the lack of significant progress in the fighting.

### Further Details of the Naval Battle of the Solomon Islands

Reuters report from Tokyo, 24th: According to a report from a naval correspondent on board a certain Japanese warship on the 20th, at 5:00 PM on August 8th, the Japanese fleet advanced eastward from the Solomon Islands in the fading twilight. When they reached the vicinity of Savo Island, they encountered the British and American fleets. The Japanese fleet immediately displayed its traditional spirit of night attack, sinking eight enemy light and heavy cruisers, six destroyers, and damaging two destroyers, achieving a great victory. At that time, the Japanese fleet suddenly entered the enemy fleet's formation in a sea area only fifteen miles wide, engaging in a close-quarters naval battle, which is unprecedented in world naval history. The Japanese reporters, aboard a certain battleship, participated in this historically significant night battle in the Savo Strait, witnessing the heroic battle firsthand and were greatly inspired. They wrote this account of the Battle of the Solomon Islands on their way back to base. On the morning of the 8th, as the Japanese fleet was speeding through the waters north of the Solomon Islands, all officers and men were in high spirits, awaiting a decisive battle. That day happened to be the eighth anniversary of the Imperial Rescript, and their belief in victory became even stronger. Later, enemy aircraft appeared in the sky twice, and the ships fired one after another, repelling them. At around 5:00 PM, as dusk was approaching, the decisive battle began. The ships fired flares one after another, and soon the main guns of a certain warship began to roar. By 11:40 PM, the sound of torpedoes exploding was also heard in the water. From afar, flames were seen rising straight up on the sea surface to the right. An enemy ship had split into two, and the bow and stern immediately sank into the sea from the flames. The British A-class cruiser of the Australia class was sunk by a torpedo from the Japanese flagship. At the same time, flames shot up nearby, and an enemy ship was hit by the shells of a subsequent Japanese ship. While observing, the main guns of the Japanese flagship roared again. Looking back to the left, the center of an enemy ship was seen to have been hit in the abdomen. Looking further through the searchlight, two enemy A-class cruisers were clearly visible. The Japanese aircraft immediately took off and launched a fierce bombing attack. The sounds of rumbling and booming intermingled with flying sparks, creating an unprecedented spectacle. The enemy ships were in a difficult situation, advancing and retreating with difficulty. The American A-class cruiser Astoria had two-thirds of it engulfed in flames and was still heading towards the Japanese warship. Judging from the situation, it seemed that the steering had been lost. At that time, the enemy ship was still firing its 25mm machine guns at the Japanese warship. As it got closer and closer, enemy figures could be vaguely seen through the binoculars. The Japanese warship continued to fire at it, and soon it sank into the sea, becoming food for the fish. It was 2:00 AM the next day. At that time, the Japanese fleet still maintained its original formation, without any changes. Amidst songs of victory, it returned to base along the original route.

### Japanese Aircraft Attack Darwin Harbor

Reuters report from Lisbon, 24th: According to a report from Melbourne, the Australian Allied Forces Headquarters announced that Japanese fighter planes, accompanied by heavy bombers, attacked Darwin Harbor yesterday, focusing on the airfield.

### Jones, Naval Chief of Staff for New Zealand and Australia, Promoted to Rear Admiral

Reuters report from Lisbon, 23rd: The Allied Forces Headquarters in the Southwest Pacific announced today that Colonel Jones, Chief of Staff of the Naval Headquarters for the New Zealand and Australia region, has been promoted to Rear Admiral.

### Strong Earthquake Occurs

Havas report from New York, 23rd: According to records from the astronomical observatory here this morning, a strong earthquake occurred in the northwest, with the source located near the western end of the Aleutian Islands.

### British Authorities Hold Meeting to Discuss Practical Aid to the Soviet Union, Soviet Union Urges Opening of Second Front, Dieppe Landing May Be Repeated

Havas report from Bern, 23rd: Soviet newspapers and radio stations are still demanding the opening of a second front. Soviet newspapers did not initially give prominent coverage to the British landing at Dieppe on the northern coast of France, and even considered it a sign that opening a second front would be easier to achieve. For example, a TASS diplomatic correspondent once said, "The Dieppe operation should be repeated. The fact that British troops were able to land on the European continent shows that the German defenses along the European coast are not impenetrable." In addition, Soviet newspapers have devoted considerable space to covering the repeated meetings of British and American public and private organizations advocating the opening of a second front. Meanwhile, according to news from London, British authorities are holding important meetings to discuss this matter. The diplomatic correspondent for the Sunday Times stated, "Efforts are being made to implement what was decided at the Moscow conference. The transportation of large quantities of weapons and ammunition to the Soviet Union is also under discussion. Allied military authorities plan to tie down German forces this winter and continuously bomb German industrial areas. In short, in the coming days, the war situation will enter a new phase, and all those at war with the Axis powers should take new actions."

### After Brazil Declares War on Germany and Italy, Flames of War Spread to South America, Argentina and Chile's Attitudes Draw Close Attention, Brazil Begins General Mobilization to Strengthen Defenses

Reuters report from Buenos Aires, 23rd: After the Brazilian government declared war on Germany and Italy on the 22nd, it began general mobilization measures. It is also reported that Brazilian Foreign Minister Aranha announced that all international agreements unfavorable to Brazil would be abolished.

Reuters report from Lisbon, 23rd: According to Wilson, a United Press special correspondent in Rio de Janeiro, regarding the actions taken by Brazil after declaring war on Germany and Italy, he has the following opinions: After Brazil's declaration of war on Germany and Italy, there will be three direct consequences: In the past, some of the incidents of Brazilian ships being sunk were due to the activities of spies and the Fifth Column. In order to curb their activities, a large-scale purge will be carried out in the country. In order to supply a large amount of military supplies to the United Nations, the domestic economic work will be strengthened. The strengthening of national defense is also being rapidly promoted.

Havas report from Buenos Aires, 23rd: Although Brazil's declaration of war on Germany and Italy was long expected, the public announcement of the state of war by the Brazilian government yesterday still caused considerable shock here and in other capitals of Latin America. Brazil's declaration of war on the Axis powers has not only drawn South America into the war, but has also presented other South American countries with pressing and difficult problems. Argentina and Chile, as the two major powers in South America, their actions will undoubtedly affect the overall situation. However, as of now, these countries have not followed the resolutions of the previous Pan-American Conference to sever diplomatic relations with the Axis powers. News from Santiago, Chile, indicates that the country will continue to pursue a pragmatic policy and does not intend to take any drastic action for the time being. However, the Chilean government will reiterate that it is prepared to cooperate with the United States in the economic sphere. As for Argentina's attitude, Foreign Minister Guani stated to the press today that the matter will be clarified tomorrow, but it is generally expected that Argentina will not declare war on Germany and Italy. At the same time, Uruguay's decision not to declare war on the Axis powers will have a significant impact on Argentina. If Uruguay were to participate in the war, the fighting would spread to the Plata River, which borders Uruguay and Argentina, and Argentina would find it difficult to remain uninvolved. According to the latest news from Montevideo, President Baldomir will not force the country to go to war without consulting public opinion. He has also ordered that Brazil be treated as a non-belligerent, so that relations between the two countries will not be affected in any way by Brazil's declaration of war on countries outside of the Americas. This is because, according to the agreement passed by the Pan-American Conference, if one of the signatory countries goes to war with a country outside of the Americas, the other signatory countries should treat it as a non-belligerent, so that they can continue to provide assistance.

### Uruguay Issues Declaration, Officially Clarifying Stance, Decides to Grant Belligerent Rights to Brazil

Havas report from Montevideo, 23rd: The rumor that Uruguay has decided to declare war on the Axis powers has been strongly denied by official sources here. The situation arising from Brazil's declaration of war on Germany and Italy is being carefully studied here.

Havas report from Montevideo, 24th: After Brazil's declaration of war on the Axis powers, Uruguayan Foreign Minister Guani is drafting a declaration to clearly express Uruguay's position on Brazil. The content has been largely mentioned in President Baldomir's telegram to Brazilian President Vargas, which roughly states that Uruguay will cooperate with Brazil in accordance with the various obligations of the Pan-American Agreement, but does not intend to affect Uruguay's position on the Axis powers. If Uruguay were to enter a state of war, it would lead to various international problems, such as the Plata River being designated as a war zone. The river is the only waterway leading to the neutral capital of Argentina.

Havas report from Buenos Aires, 24th: The Uruguayan government's decision to grant Brazil non-belligerent rights, and President Baldomir's telegram to Brazilian President Vargas guaranteeing continued relations between the two countries, have been closely watched by South American political circles today. It is generally expected that Uruguay will follow in Brazil's footsteps and declare war on the Axis powers. Observers here also believe that most South American countries will currently only grant Brazil non-belligerent rights, and Argentina and Chile will likely do the same. This is in line with Argentina's immediate attitude towards the United States after the outbreak of war between the United States and Japan. In other words, it will grant belligerent rights to the United States while strictly maintaining neutrality towards other belligerents.

German and Italian Immigrants Flee into Uruguay

Havas report from Montevideo, 23rd: Since Brazil announced its declaration of war on the Axis powers, many German and Italian immigrants residing in southern Brazil have attempted to flee into Uruguay. The security forces along the Brazilian border have been increased. However, as of now, several hundred people have still fled into Uruguayan territory.

Submarine Discovered at the Mouth of the Yaguarón River

Havas report from Montevideo, 23rd: According to sources in the shipping industry, two submarines, believed to be German, were discovered 112 miles northeast of the mouth of the Yaguarón River. (Note: The Yaguarón River is the natural boundary between Uruguay and Brazil.)

Estimated Brazilian Naval and Military Strength

Reuters report from Stockholm, 24th: Political figures in London have pointed out Brazil's strategic importance because of its proximity to West Africa. They also said that although the Brazilian navy is small, it has a large merchant fleet, which is very helpful to Allied shipping. The Brazilian army is not fully equipped, but with the help of the Lend-Lease Act and the $25 million loan from Washington, it will be reorganized.

Havas report from Vichy, 23rd: The newspaper "Le Temps" here recently published an editorial commenting on Brazil's participation in the war, stating that although Brazil has declared a state of war with Germany and Italy, it may not actively participate in the war. Its task will likely be limited to protecting shipping in its territorial waters. However, the Brazilian government's decision yesterday to spread the flames of war to South America is noteworthy. In short, the United States' policy of forcing North and South American countries to listen to its commands under the pretext of jointly defending the New World has undoubtedly been successful. However, Brazil's participation in the war may not be of any benefit to the American war machine. On the contrary, the scope of activity of German submarines will expand to the entire American Atlantic coast. Other newspapers here have also published Brazil's current military strength, which includes an army of 80,000 men, divided into five infantry divisions, three cavalry divisions, and one coastal artillery unit, but all are without modern weapons. The navy has 80,000 tons of warships, including two old cruisers, the "Minas Gerais" and the "São Paulo," which account for half of the total tonnage. In addition, there is one coastal cruiser with a displacement of 3,000 tons, two light cruisers, eight destroyers, and four submarines.

No Official German Response Yet

Reuters report from Berlin, 24th: German officials have not yet issued an official response to Brazil's decision to declare war on Germany and Italy. Germans believe that Brazil's attitude in recent months has been little different from being at war with Germany. American submarines have been using Brazilian ports as bases of operation, and Brazilian warships have been cooperating with American warships to protect enemy convoys. Therefore, Brazil's participation in the war will not bring about any military changes for Germany or the enemy.

Reuters report from Berlin, 24th: According to political figures in Berlin, Brazil's independent status has been harmed by its declaration of war on Germany and Italy. The consequences of Brazil's declaration of war should be borne by the United States and Britain. Brazil claims that it had no choice but to declare war on Germany and Italy because Brazilian ships were sunk by German submarines, but Brazil has been preparing to participate in the war for several years. Since 1938, the influence of the United States in Brazil has been increasing. American loans to Brazil, explicitly designated for military spending, amount to as much as 100,000,000 gold yuan. During the Pan-American Conference held in the Brazilian capital, the Brazilian Foreign Minister secretly encouraged South American countries to sever diplomatic relations with the Axis powers. The Brazilian government's hostile attitude towards the Axis powers occurred before Brazilian ships were sunk. The day before Brazil severed diplomatic relations with the Axis powers, it arrested 23 German immigrants, and all German consulates were closed. When the Brazilian government severed diplomatic relations with the Axis powers on January 28, it arrested another 20 German immigrants. Brazil's mistreatment of German immigrants occurred long before Brazilian ships were sunk. German immigrants were accused of engaging in espionage and other activities that endangered Brazil. The Brazilian government used anti-German propaganda to incite anti-German sentiment among the Brazilian people, leading to the possibility of violence against those who spoke German. All German immigrant businesses have been shut down, and German immigrant property is about to be confiscated. The severance of diplomatic relations between Germany and Brazil and Brazil's declaration of war on Germany are merely the inevitable consequences of an anti-German attitude.

Portugal Expresses Sympathy to Brazil

Reuters report from Lisbon, 2nd: An official Portuguese statement states that the Portuguese government has been informed of Brazil's decision to declare war on Germany and Italy and has instructed its ambassador to Brazil to express Portugal's sympathy for Brazil's sacrificial attitude to the Brazilian government. Yesterday afternoon, the Brazilian ambassador to Argentina called on Portuguese Prime Minister Salazar to explain the reasons for Brazil's participation in the war. Salazar immediately reported to Portuguese President Carmona, who sent a message to Brazilian President Vargas expressing the sympathy of the Portuguese people.

Reuters report from Lisbon, 24th: Although Portuguese newspapers have published the news of Brazil's declaration of war on Germany and Italy, none have issued comments. The government newspaper "Diário de Manhã" states that the friendly relations between Portugal and Brazil will not be affected by any developments. Brazil is an independent country, and its rulers have the right to express their attitude. According to economic figures in Lisbon, Brazil's declaration of war on Germany and Italy may economically affect neutral Portugal. Brazilian ships will no longer be able to come and go between the two countries, and the port of Lisbon will likely become deserted, and Portugal's foreign trade will inevitably suffer a major impact.

Reuters report from Buenos Aires, 24th: The Argentine government is still closely studying the situation after Brazil's declaration of war on Germany and Italy. President Castillo held a long discussion with Foreign Minister Guani yesterday morning, and Guani met with several people in the afternoon to discuss various important issues in detail.

### Argentina Carefully Studies the Situation

Reuters report from Buenos Aires, 24th: The Argentine cabinet, which was originally scheduled to hold a cabinet meeting today to discuss the new situation created by Brazil's declaration of war on Germany and Italy, has been postponed. It is generally expected that the Argentine government will recognize Brazil as a non-belligerent.

### Bolivian Foreign Minister Resigns

Reuters report from Buenos Aires, 24th: A dispatch from La Paz states that Bolivian Foreign Minister Matienzo has submitted his resignation. The reason is unknown.

### Indian Parliament to Hold Special Session to Review Government Policies, Financial Circles Support Anti-British Movement

Reuters report from Lisbon, 24th: According to a dispatch from New Delhi, the Indian Central Legislative Assembly will convene a special session, unprecedented in the history of the Indian Parliament, to review the current domestic political situation. It is expected to begin around September 16th and last for about a week. This session was proposed by Sikh member Sarup Singh Sadhu Singh, who recently wrote to members of both houses, arguing that the government's policies should be explained in detail in light of the current situation, and that everyone should have the opportunity to discuss and vote on them together.

Reuters report from Tokyo, 24th: According to a dispatch from Stockholm, in order to persist in the anti-British struggle in India to the end, organized and planned actions are gradually being carried out. The Daily Mail of Bombay reports that the anti-British struggle has recently received full assistance from Indian financial capitalists, so the future is becoming increasingly severe. The general idea is that the future of the anti-British struggle in India will gradually become more profound and significant. What is particularly noteworthy is that Indian commercial, industrial, and financial capitalists are providing strong economic support to the anti-British struggle of the Congress Party. Recently, several leading figures in the Indian financial community have donated millions of rupees to the Congress Party leadership as an anti-British struggle fund. The British Indian authorities are extremely embarrassed by this and have begun arresting managers of large companies in Bombay and other members of the bourgeoisie, making every effort to disrupt the Congress Party's funding. However, so far, no effect has been achieved.

Reuters report from Rangoon, 24th: According to the latest news from India, although the British authorities are making efforts to suppress the anti-British movement in India, it is still spreading rapidly. Railway workers in southern India have almost completely joined the anti-British movement and refuse to return to work. It is also learned that the British authorities have ordered cities controlled by the Congress Party to pay fines. The city of Chimur in the Chanda district has been fined 100,000 rupees, and the city of Ashti in the Wardha district has been fined 50,000 rupees.

Reuters report from Lisbon, 23rd: According to information obtained here, the British are still using high-handed measures to suppress the anti-British movement in various parts of India. British police in New Delhi forcibly dispersed demonstrating crowds and arrested their leaders. British authorities in Calcutta have also closed Calcutta University. In the Central Provinces of Nagpur, 50 Indians who were considered to be inciting the anti-British movement have been severely punished. The autonomous central bodies of the city and the autonomous bodies of Wardha have been forced to disband. Indians in Tinur, Charda, and Asthi have also been fined by the British authorities. A proclamation has been issued in Baroda prohibiting public gatherings, and eight Indians have been arrested.

### Developments in the Soviet War Situation: Important Position of the Middle East; British Troops Stationed in Iran and Iraq Under the Command of General Wilson

Lisbon, 24th (Allied News Agency) - The British War Office announced today that the troops stationed in Iran and Iraq are now combined under the command of the "Iran-Iraq Command" to alleviate the burden on General Alexander, Commander of the Middle East Forces. The command is assumed by General Wilson, who was previously the commander of the British 9th Army. Prime Minister Churchill met with him after arriving in Kyiv from Moscow. A Reuters military reporter explained that with German troops only an hour's flight from the Iranian border, the importance of Iran and Iraq will undoubtedly increase. This move is related to the change of commander of the Middle East Forces. Iran and Iraq were originally under the defense zone of General Wavell, Commander-in-Chief of the Indian Command, until January of this year, when they were transferred to the defense zone of General Auchinleck, Commander-in-Chief of the Middle East Forces. However, this situation was not appropriate. After a reorganization, Britain now has three military regions in the East: the Indian Military Region, facing the Japanese army to the east; the Middle East Military Region, facing the German army on the Egyptian border to the west; and the Iran-Iraq Defense Region, facing the German army in the Caucasus region to the north.

### Rumors of British and American Efforts to Win Over Turkey: Request to Station Troops in Western Iran; Turkish Government Adopts Cautious Attitude; President Ismet Inspects Black Sea Coast

Tokyo, 24th (Allied News Agency) - According to a Tokyo Nichi Nichi Shimbun dispatch from Istanbul, with the situation in the Caucasus becoming increasingly serious, Turkey's attitude towards the Soviet Union has a significant impact on the future war situation in West Asia and has attracted much attention. In order to win over Turkey and form a second front in the Southern Caucasus and Iran, Britain and the United States, taking advantage of Turkey's protest to the Soviet Union against the oppression of the Turkish minority in western Iran, proposed to the Turkish government during the recent Moscow talks, through the British and American ambassadors stationed in Ankara, to guarantee the safety of the Turkish minority in western Iran and requested Turkey to participate with Britain and the Soviet Union in occupying a part of Iran while maintaining neutrality. In this way, western Iran could be prevented from falling into German hands during the Caucasus campaign. However, the Turkish government is taking a cautious attitude towards this matter and has not yet responded.

Istanbul, 24th (Haitong News Agency) - Turkish President Ismet is inspecting central Anatolia and has arrived at Songgang on the Black Sea coast. Political figures are paying attention to the President's inspection of the Black Sea coast due to the Caucasus war.

### From Lecturing to Imprisonment (6)

— Tie Ming

He came back when I had just finished eating. My hounds would wait for me in Tongzilong, and they must have expected me to go back to England, so I changed my plan again temporarily, rushed to the East Railway Station (Gared de PEst), bought a ticket to Bern (Eerne), Switzerland, planning to transfer to Germany from Switzerland and then return to England. Moreover, no passport or visa was required to go to Switzerland.

Perhaps it was suspicion that bred ghosts. When I bought the ticket, I seemed to see someone looking at me a few times and then walking into a telephone booth to make a call. I never encountered this person again afterward, and nothing unexpected happened to my journey until Belfort (BeLforl). In the Paris Soir newspaper, I saw two very noteworthy news items. One was that the person with a jaw injury in the hospital had revealed his name. Of course, the name was fabricated, but he could speak, which increased my concern. The other was titled "Unnamed Man Commits Suicide" (Un Inconnuse Suieide). This person hanged himself on the scaffolding of a newly built house. He had no front teeth, was missing his left ear, and had a piece of paper in his pocket with the words "tired of life, suicide." Martin was finished off by them. Before they hanged him, they may have forced him to reveal my name and background. I had to be extra careful not to follow in Martin's footsteps.

It was dark when I arrived in Belfort. As the train was entering the station, I caught a glimpse of the little mustache standing on the platform with two other people. It was a real enemy meeting on a narrow road! Belfort was on the air route, so he must have taken a plane here specifically to wait for me. For a moment, I had nowhere to hide, so I grabbed my handbag and locked myself in the restroom. At that time, the train had not yet come to a complete stop—perhaps he hadn't seen me yet. I had no way of knowing his purpose. Maybe he just wanted to hand me over to the police on the charge of blowing up his friend. I absolutely couldn't take the risk.

The train stopped at Belfort station for a long time before continuing. At that time, I was hesitating, not knowing what to do. I couldn't wait in the restroom forever, but what should I do when I went out? Readers may remember that the trams in Shanghai twenty years ago could be jumped on and off at any time. I had practiced this very well since I was a child, and it was not difficult to get on and off even when the tram was moving at its fastest. But the train was very high, different from the tram. I was also different now, a bit older, and hadn't trained for more than ten years. I really wasn't very confident about jumping off the train. And in this situation, wouldn't a fall mean being resigned to fate?

But the train had just left the station when it stopped. There was no light outside, so it must have been waiting for another train outside the station. This was a great opportunity. I came out of my hiding place and quickly jumped out of a door on the left side of the train. At this time, the train was gradually moving. In the darkness, someone on the train shot at me, but luckily it didn't hit me. I had already crossed two tracks, and an express train to Paris was pulling into the station on the opposite side, cutting off the range of the bullets and acting as my shield. Under this cover, I kept running. I was still lucky enough to run to a road that intersected with the railway, where a truck was stopped by the barrier. I negotiated with the driver and paid him a hundred francs, and he agreed to take me to Besançon (Besacon). The truck was carrying a load of furniture from Strasbourg (Strasbonrg) to Lons-le-Saunier (Lousle Sanuier) and was planning to spend the night in Besançon. I felt that I was not yet out of danger and still needed to be careful, so I told the driver the real situation, saying that someone was tracking me down to harm me. But I made up another reason for wanting to harm me. I knew the romantic atmosphere of the French. The wandering profession of truck drivers was especially conducive to fostering this atmosphere. As soon as I looked at this driver, I knew that he was also a skilled member of this profession, so in order to gain his sympathy, I winked at him and told him that I was having an affair with a rich man's mistress and had agreed to elope. She had already gone to Switzerland, but I was being tracked down by people hired by the rich man. I paid him another fifty francs and asked him to hide me under a roll of carpets behind a table, and then cover it with tarpaulin. Only then did we set off for Besançon.

If readers remember the experience of sitting in the back of a truck when long-distance buses first started more than ten years ago, they will know how uncomfortable it is for a truck to travel on uneven roads. I haven't seen the state of road traffic in our country since the war, but I sincerely hope that it is not as difficult as my escape this time. The truck was very old and the road was very uneven. I tried my best to support my hands on the table legs on both sides, which made my arms numb, and I still couldn't avoid hitting myself several times, and my head had several violent collisions with the top of the table!

The truck had only been driving for about twenty minutes when it suddenly stopped. The voices were very loud. French is the least suitable language for cursing. Most French people are realists, so religious curses such as "go to hell" and "son of a bitch" are completely ineffective. In our country, people curse ancestors, but the French have a weak sense of family and do not have the custom of cursing ancestors. As for male and female physiological curses, they are nothing to the Latin people. I only know one curse word in French, and the driver was constantly using this word now. I only heard what seemed to be the voices of three people arguing fiercely. The driver insisted that he had not seen anyone like me, let alone carrying me in the truck. They were willing to give him fifty francs to take a look at what was under the tarpaulin, but he cursed and refused, and he also mentioned the police and the law. The two blockers discussed in a low voice, and it seemed that they also felt it was inconvenient to force every driver with a gun to search every truck, so soon they heard a large car drive away.

At this time, I had become a frightened bird, so no matter how hard it was to sit under the table, I refused the driver's kindness and continued to sit in the back. This lasted for another two hours before we arrived in Besançon, leaving me aching all over. While having a drink in a small hotel—which the driver insisted on buying me—he told me that when we were about to arrive in Besançon, we encountered the big car driving back, and the two people in the car glared at him fiercely! My pain was exchanged for my life!

That night, I was extremely tired, but I had no time to rest and had to immediately plan a follow-up plan. I thought that since the organization of the maintenance association was so complete and its actions were so swift, it would probably know my name and background soon. So I immediately wrote a letter to the Dean of Christ Church, Oxford, telling him that I had finished lecturing at the University of Paris, but was feeling very tired and was taking a rest in southern Germany. I would not be returning to England in the autumn, as I intended to accept the invitation of Professor Mitcherlich of the University of Konigsberg to visit and lecture on my experience in researching soil with physiological methods in Zhejiang. I would also take the opportunity to travel to East Prussia and the small countries of the Baltic Sea and would probably not be back until the Hilary term. The contents of this letter, as usual, would be published in the university news column of The Times of London. If the maintenance association had paid attention to Oxford University, they would definitely see this news, which was very relevant to them. I also wrote a letter to a friend in Munich (Munchen), asking him to immediately send the letter from Oxford University for me and not to publicize this matter. This mixture of truth and falsehood might divert the maintenance association's attention to Germany.

### Tonight's Air Raid Drill: Blackout, Preparedness for Air Raid Rescue; French Authorities Hope Residents Will Cooperate Fully; Neighborhood Watch and Health Committee Established

Regarding tonight's blackout drill, the French Concession authorities are urging residents to pay attention and to comply with the measures necessary, and to cooperate fully, as this matter is related to the interests of the residents themselves.

Temporary Ban on Burning Paper Offerings

The Council hereby issues a notice stating that residents are prohibited from lighting incense or burning paper offerings outdoors from 7:00 PM to 11:30 PM tonight. Those who wish to light incense or burn paper offerings outdoors must complete this by 7:00 PM this afternoon so that the light from incense and paper can be extinguished by 7:00 PM at the latest. Otherwise, it can be held after the blackout drill ends at 11:30 PM in the evening, but this is dangerous late at night and residents should not do it.

### Public Concession Neighborhood Watch Self-Defense Corps to Stand Guard All Night Starting Next Month, Divided into Two Shifts: 12:00-3:00 AM and 3:00-6:00 AM

The current guard duty hours of the Public Concession Neighborhood Watch Self-Defense Corps are set to end at 12:00 midnight, and there are no patrols between 12:00 midnight and 6:00 AM the next day. Therefore, petty thieves and other vagrants inevitably take advantage of this time to move around. It is learned that the Neighborhood Watch Steering Committee, in order to improve security, has re-regulated the guard duty hours of the Self-Defense Corps. Starting from September 1st, two night shifts will be added from 12:00 to 3:00 AM and from 3:00 to 6:00 AM. The Neighborhood Watch Steering Committee has notified each Neighborhood Watch liaison to strictly comply. However, it is reported that the Japanese Navy Neighborhood Watch area north of Suzhou Creek has always implemented all-night guard duty, so from now on, the prevention and control measures south and north of Suzhou Creek will be unified.

### North and South American Nationals Continue to Evacuate, Negotiations Have Been Established, Two More Ships Can Set Sail in Early Next Month, American Association Continues to Urge Nationals to Register

According to Mr. Masaki, translator of the Japanese Consulate General in Shanghai, speaking to a reporter from the "Great American Evening Post," two more evacuation ships will depart from Shanghai in early September this year, carrying nationals of North and South American countries to Lourenço Marques.

Two More Ships to Set Sail Next Month

Mr. Masaki said that official reports have been received from Tokyo that negotiations have been established between governments regarding the next exchange of nationals. As for the fifth and sixth postal ships responsible for evacuating nationals, they may sail in the first week of September. Japanese officials are currently busy deciding the procedures for evacuating nationals. The names and histories of the two evacuation ships have not yet been notified. It is also unknown whether these two ships will depart from Shanghai, or whether another will depart from Japan, as was the case with the first Conte Verde and Asama Maru when they evacuated foreigners from the Far East.

Evacuating Nationals of North and South America

However, it has been pointed out that the Conte Verde and Asama Maru, which carried Japanese nationals who had stayed in the United States back from Lourenço Marques last week, are very likely to be used for the next time. As these two ships have had previous voyages, it is generally considered ideal for them to sail again to East Africa. It is said that the two evacuation ships for the next voyage will not carry British and other European Allied nationals; they will only be used to exclusively carry nationals of North and South American countries. At the same time, it is widely rumored today that foreigners in this port will be included.

American Association Issues Notice to Register

As of now, a total of 1,369 American nationals have been evacuated from the two concessions and the western area, including 383 residents of the Public Concession, 744 residents of the French Concession, and 242 residents of the western area of Shanghai. It is also known that the majority of American nationals have recently arrived from Manila, while a portion may have come from inland China. At the same time, the American Association of this port today advised American nationals who have not yet registered with the association to do so by the end of this month. Association President Huntington has issued a notice stating that it is extremely important for every American national to register with the association.

Kamakura Maru Has Arrived in Singapore

According to a Singapore wire report on August 23, the Kamakura Maru, which carried British and other Allied nationals from the Far East to Lourenço Marques, arrived here this morning from Yokohama and Shanghai to obtain food and beverages. This ship is scheduled to continue sailing tomorrow morning.

### Warning Signals Dropped in Unequipped Areas

According to the Allied News Agency, the Shanghai Land and Sea Air Defense Headquarters recently announced that the Shanghai training blackout alert will be implemented from 7:30 PM on the 25th, lasting until 11:30 PM, for a total of four hours. Military and civilian circles in the city are working hard on various preparations for the implementation of the blackout. On that night, in areas without blackout equipment, airplanes will drop ignition signals to alert the citizens of the area. The heads of the Neighborhood Watch in those areas will be punished.

### Shanghai West Nightclubs Request Further Extension of Closing Time, Said That This Request Will Be Granted in the Short Term

The English-language "The China Press" reported that the owners and managers of nightclubs in Shanghai West expressed their opinion last night that the Shanghai West authorities will grant their last request to extend the closing time to 1:20 AM in the near future.

Discussion to Extend Closing Time

Nightclubs in the two concessions have now extended their business hours to 12:00 midnight, which is due to the Hua-area authorities in Shanghai West allowing it first. It is learned that Pan Danye met with the Hua-area authorities at the end of last week to discuss the issue of further extending business hours in Shanghai West.

Will Be Granted in the Short Term

According to news obtained yesterday, Pan Danye will summon the owners and managers of nightclubs in his area in the next few days to explain his attitude. Since August 1st, after extending the closing time to 12:30 AM, Pan Danye has begun to levy a 20% tax on the prices of food and drinks sold in each nightclub. Currently, nightclubs are hoping to be allowed to extend their business hours to 2:30 AM, as they have suffered some losses since July 9th, when they had to close before 11:00 PM. After their request, they were able to extend it to 11:30 PM.

### End of August Deadline Approaching: Radio Registration Required Promptly

A dispatch from the Central History Society of Shanghai reports that the highest Japanese authorities in this city issued a notice on June 25th of this year, stipulating that all owners of wireless radios, regardless of nationality, must complete a registration form between July 1st and the end of August of this year, providing detailed information including name, nationality, address, occupation, number of vacuum tubes, whether the radio has shortwave capability, and the radio's name or manufacturer. Since the beginning of the registration period, there has been a considerable rush to register. With the deadline at the end of August rapidly approaching, it is hoped that those who have not yet registered will promptly complete the procedures as scheduled to avoid penalties and losses due to late registration.

### Public Concession Detectives: Seventy-Two Promoted

### Former Bank Director Plagued by Poverty: Career Ruined, Family Destroyed, Defrauding His Aunt of a Large Sum by Selling Her Land, Case of Forged Documents Leads to Wife's Suicide Out of Shame

Cheng Bonian, a local resident of Shanghai, residing at 32, Lane 613, Avenue Joffre, is 43 years old. He was formerly the Director of General Affairs at the Tonghe Bank, but has been unemployed for a long time and is plagued by poverty. He has also become addicted to opium, which has led to financial difficulties, so he came up with a bizarre idea. In May of this year, he approached his aunt, Ms. Yu Cheng (who lives at 35, 4 Lane 623 on the same road), claiming that he was preparing to open a large-scale coffin factory with a capital of 100,000 yuan. He claimed to have already obtained 70,000 yuan and only needed 30,000 yuan more, and asked his aunt to temporarily lend him the money or join as a shareholder. Ms. Cheng believed him, but because she didn't have cash, she gave him the land deed for 8 fen of land at Damatou in Nanshi to mortgage.

Cheng Bonian obtained the land deed and immediately took it to Zhan Peilin, the owner of Yiji Paper Shop at 127 Shandong Road, to sell it. The two parties agreed on a land price of 150,000 yuan. A contract was signed at an accountant's office. Cheng Bonian had his wife, Ms. Qu Cheng, come to the scene and impersonate the seller, signing the deal. The buyer, Zhan Peilin, handed over a check for 150,000 yuan from Zhejiang Industrial Bank. Cheng Bonian obtained the money and lived freely, spending his days smoking opium and frequenting gambling dens and opium dens in Nanshi. At the end of last month, his cousin, Yu Yongshu, asked Cheng Bonian to return the land deed he had borrowed. Cheng Bonian went to the Qingyun Pavilion printing shop on Henan Road and forged a land deed to return to Yu Yongshu. Yu took the deed to the bureau for registration and discovered that it was a forgery. He reported it to the French police, accusing Cheng of forgery of official documents and fraud. The detectives arrested Cheng Bonian and brought him to justice. They also tracked down a portion of the stolen money. When Cheng's wife, Ms. Xu, heard the news, she was distressed by her husband's depravity and felt that all her future happiness had been lost. Out of anger and resentment, she committed suicide. At the time, the family reported to the authorities that Cheng had fled after speculative investments failed, and his wife committed suicide. This is the end result of depravity, leading to death and the destruction of a family. Seeing Cheng's outcome, his aunt could not bear to pursue the matter harshly.

Business News

### Under Attack from Selling Pressure: Chinese Stocks Cannot Bear to Look Back

Yesterday, the situation of Chinese stocks was originally stabilizing. Unexpectedly, public utilities and department store stocks were suddenly attacked by selling pressure, which led to a decline. The people's confidence weakened after the Zhabei Water & Electricity stock broke through the 30 yuan mark last weekend. It retreated to a low price of 27.5 yuan, a decrease of 1.5 yuan. China General Edison fell by 5 jiao.

Factory Cloth: The cloth market yesterday remained in a volatile situation, with cotton in a weakened market, sales stagnant, and peach blossom brands particularly weak. Trading opened at 257.25 yuan, and by noon, it had fallen to 255.5 yuan. It continued to decline in the afternoon to 255.25 yuan, 2 yuan lower than last Saturday. Other coarse and fine cloths fell by about 1 yuan. 16-pound Earth coarse cloth was 177 yuan, Flying Goose 174 yuan, 9-pound New Character 107 yuan, 8-pound Zhenzhong 105 yuan, 12-pound Earth fine cloth 158 yuan, Dapeng Factory single 148 yuan, Fugui 150 yuan. Bleached cloth and serge were stable without major fluctuations. Magnolia bleached cloth was still selling for 160 yuan, San Yang serge 5.8 yuan, Qin Meiren plain cloth 132 yuan, and Mermaid twill 137 yuan.

Eastern Cloth: Because retail investors continued to sell, the serge, such as the Longtou new single, continued to decline. However, the middle-range color ball and other fine cloths were in real demand among dealers, the base was quite tight, and the price was also firm. 12-pound Longtou fine cloth new single closed at 173.5 yuan at noon, down 1 yuan, Color Ball 161 yuan, Flying Fish 158 yuan, Yanghe 157 yuan, Trumpet 155 yuan, Shibei fine twill 145 yuan, and Jiao Ji were all hard. Four Gentlemen serge opened at 7.25 yuan, fell to 7.18 yuan, and closed at 7.2 yuan at noon, a decrease of 7 fen.

### Camel Wool Sales Weak, Price Remains Firm

Since customer sales of camel wool stopped, the sales channel has decreased year by year. Because foreign goods dealers have given discounts, the patterns and assortments are relatively large, and buyers tend to flock to them, while the wool dealers have little profit, and they all give up selling, resulting in a reduction in the sales channel for camel wool. In addition, the popularity of silk and cotton robes has also hit sales. However, observing the recent camel wool, although sales are weak, the price remains firm, which is related to the manufacturing cost. Yesterday, the ordinary brands, the first grade was quoted at 50 yuan per yard, the second grade 40 yuan, the third grade 32 yuan, and the fourth grade 26 yuan.

### Miscellaneous Grain Retail Sales Improve

The retail market situation for beans slightly improved yesterday, while sellers were very few, so the market was prosperous. A consignment of 70 bags of Tianjin mung beans opened at 230 yuan. In addition, 30 bags of red beans were priced at 165 yuan.

Due to the good demand for corn among the poor, and the source of goods was not smooth, the market suddenly showed signs of improvement. Yesterday, 600 bags of Wuhu corn opened at 108 to 109 yuan, and 100 bags of Dutch corn were priced at 110 yuan, an increase of 4 to 5 yuan from the previous day.

Sweet potato chips were in steady demand, and the arrival of goods was scarce, so the market turned higher. Yesterday, a consignment of 40 bags of Shandong sweet potato chips opened at 107 yuan.

Domestic sales of bean cake have reached the end, and foreign merchants lack motivation, so the transaction has been quiet for a long time. Yesterday, 500 pieces of Shengji bean cake for June were priced at 60 yuan, and the market was sluggish.

Bran inventories were reduced, and sales were brisk. Yesterday, 300 bags of Sanxin small-pack bran for the May shipment opened at 99.8 yuan, an increase of 3 jiao from the previous day.

### Sugar Shares Initially Tight, Then Flat

Yesterday, sugar merchant cooperative business sugar shares: the bulls continued to absorb, so the coarse sand shares opened higher in the guild's trading session, rising 2 yuan to 303 yuan, reaching a high of 304 yuan, and closing slightly lower at 302 yuan, 1 yuan higher than last Saturday. Red sand shares opened at 297 yuan, up 3 yuan. A total of 2,000 bags were traded.

### Higher Prices for Upper-Grade Melon Seeds

New Melon Seeds (Nanjing): Large slices are missing due to few arrivals, and prices have risen. For example, Xuzhou large slices are 560-570 yuan, Tongcheng large slices are 570-580 yuan, and Shangji Kui seeds have reached 600 yuan, an increase of 40-50 yuan. Sales in Shanghai are even more sluggish.

### Japanese Cigarette Shipments Are Not Quiet

The prices of British and American cigarette brands have not fluctuated much recently. Because of weak sales and sluggish inventory, prices have gone from firm to weak. The market for domestic cigarettes is quite dry, and factory shipments are far away and uncertain. Because raw materials are expensive and the supply of water and electricity is limited, finished products are difficult to compete with other brands. Therefore, most factories are willing to stop production automatically. Subsequently, prices are expected to rise again. Japanese cigarettes have not been quiet recently, but the results cannot be supplied in large quantities. Because it is rumored that next month all Japanese factories will be exclusively distributed by the China Tobacco Association, and because sales are quite strong, prices have gradually risen. Yesterday's prices were: British Brands 8,250 yuan, Old Dao 5,600 yuan, Pinhai 5,000 yuan, Fairy 4,150 yuan, Wuhua 4,000 yuan, Japanese cigarettes: Golden Gun 1,860 yuan, Red Rose 1,440 yuan, Golden Building 2,220 yuan, Quanlu 1,950 yuan, Guide 1,600 yuan, Domestic cigarettes: Golden Mouse 2,400 yuan, Beauty 3,550 yuan, Pyramid 4,000 yuan. The situation is mixed.

### Special Demand for Foreign Candles in Street Sales

The market for daily necessities is tight and weak. The selling price of soap is still difficult to rise, because of the price limit. Dealers generally sell miscellaneous brands instead, so sales are stagnant. For example, the fixed capital soap is still 300 yuan, Baixiangmao soap 145 yuan, Huangxiangmao soap 215 yuan, and Scissors soap 250 yuan. It is rumored that sales of superior goods will be made under the brand name of Fire Match, resulting in a downturn. Phoenix brand fell to 1,150 yuan, the American brand 1,500 yuan, and the Golden Tripod brand 2,150 yuan. Foreign candles are in demand, and the townspeople's purchase of appetite is very smooth, so prices are rising. Baoli's Ship brand opened at 140 yuan, the Monk Hat brand at 135 yuan, and miscellaneous brands at 110 yuan, all about 10 yuan higher than the weekend.

Spring and Autumn

### Our "Home Economics"

— Jin Wen

"Home Economics" is almost a mandatory subject in girls' schools, but unfortunately, it has long become a subject in name only, contrary to its original purpose. Although the school authorities have gone to great lengths, sparing no expense to hire gilded old maids as home economics teachers, the young ladies are happy to echo, preparing a decorative apron or a complete set of Western-style kitchen attire before entering the kitchen. Then, coyly, they call "Mommy this, Mommy that" in front of the gas stove, exerting tremendous effort to finally create some steak, some sandwich, something... However, I think that both the teaching and the learning are too ignorant of the national situation and impractical.

This year, our night school (Zili Girls' Night School) has added a new home economics course. Its content is completely different from the aforementioned mismatched situation. Because I find it very practical, I am introducing it specifically for the reference of my sisters.

According to the school authorities: The home economics course takes the form of lectures, inviting scholars who are more knowledgeable in the subject to the school. The lectures are completed in one or four weeks depending on the breadth of the scope. The content includes:

The Way of Self-Cultivation and Family Harmony—To establish others, one must first establish oneself; to harmonize the family, one must first cultivate oneself. Whether in life or in work, if the self is not cultivated, the family cannot be governed. If the family is not governed, how can there be peace in the world? Moreover, we women are the mothers of children and the core of the family. In the work of eliminating illiteracy, this kind of soul-awakening work is very necessary.

Family Economic Problems—Discord in the family and disputes between husband and wife mostly arise from economic problems. Economic problems are relative. In many situations, I have seen many families where the problem is not due to insufficient income, but due to being unable to live within their means or having excessively high desires. However, this topic is very difficult to discuss well, because copying foreign materials in a bookish way would be like scratching an itch through one's boots.

Nutritional Knowledge—Ordinary families rely on women for cooking, but they lack nutritional knowledge. In their minds, nutrition and prices are directly proportional. Little do they know that cheap food often contains rich nutrients.

Love and Marriage Problems—This is said to be one of the major events in life. Although marriage cannot be considered a profession, it has such a great impact on our lives! Many sisters and parents neglect this issue or lack a deep understanding of it, leading themselves or their children into a painful predicament.

How to Be a Mother—If both husband and wife are physically healthy, which woman can escape this responsibility after marriage? How should pregnant women take care of themselves? How should infants be cared for? If we have some common sense and preparation before marriage, we may not be overwhelmed when the time comes. Being a mother is such a difficult and challenging task.

Physiological Hygiene—Ordinary people do not understand their own bodies very well. We desperately need accurate knowledge to correct seemingly correct common sense. Why do women's breasts swell? How does a child grow in the mother's womb? In addition, I hope that this course can teach me some knowledge of medicine, first aid, and nursing, because these are all common knowledge that housewives should have, so that they can calmly cope with unfortunate events.

Legal Knowledge—We hope to have some legal knowledge in order to have a safeguard in case of emergency.

Because we are housewives and do not have the money or time to receive a full education, we have deeply experienced the pain of ignorance. Moreover, because we have personally experienced various practical problems, we feel that this type of course added by the school this year is particularly practical.

### Eating

— Yu Sheng

In this day and age, buying rice is already extremely difficult, and eating is even more difficult. For those of us in the staff class, if the company does not provide meals, then eating lunch becomes a major problem. Going home to eat is too expensive and time-consuming. Eating at a restaurant costs at least five yuan in Central Reserve Certificates per meal. Therefore, in order to solve the "eating difficulty," I have spared no effort to inquire everywhere for a place that meets my ideal.

Today, I can introduce two places that are the most hygienic, economical, practical, and scientifically economical cafeterias.

First: The student cafeteria run by the Sichuan Road YMCA. It is said that their rice is completely supplied by the Public Works Department at a fair price, so the price is extremely cheap, only two yuan in Central Reserve Certificates per meal, providing one dish, one soup, and a large pot of white rice or porridge and steamed buns, for you to choose. Serving rice and dishes does not require waiters, everyone does it themselves, which is quite in line with the spirit of young people's hands being all-powerful.

Second: The members' cafeteria run by the Silver and Money Industry Association at No. 622, 6th Floor, Cishudasha Building, Nanjing Road. Their scope is relatively small, only providing meals for members, and not open to the public, but family members of members are also included in the invitation. Each meal consists of one dish, two soups, and two bowls of white rice, costing only one yuan and seventy cents in Central Reserve Certificates, which can be said to be extremely low. The dishes are also very rich.

If our staff members have difficulty solving lunch, they may as well try it once.

### Autumn Mood

— Cheng Ren

After the beginning of autumn, there have been several showers, but there is no coolness at all. It is said that "one rain makes autumn," but this year is exactly the opposite. The autumn tiger is raging, and even in the morning and evening, there is no hint of "autumn mood"!

Spring and autumn are good days. The spring breeze is warm and all things are revived. The autumn sky is clear and the air is crisp, and the sky is cloudless. Everyone has a heart of love and hate. How can people not pray for the early arrival of autumn in this year of extreme heat and rampant epidemics?

The advancement of time will not be sooner or later because of people's hearts of love and hate. After summer, it is naturally autumn, just as winter will closely follow autumn.

Furthermore, if plague is prevalent in the spring and dysentery is rampant in the autumn, people may hate spring and autumn and think they are not the best seasons.

Spring, summer, autumn, and winter, cycle endlessly, since ancient times, without changing their order. The love and hate of heat and warmth are just changes in people's hearts.

### Distinguishing Han Jingzhou and Han Yu

— Wu Zhi Zhi

The "Reading Han Yu's Biography" written by Mr. Jingyuan was published in this column on the 21st. The words and meanings are clear and fresh, and it can be called a masterpiece. However, in the second paragraph of the original text:

Changli even lightly received people's recommendation to "become a teacher for a hundred generations as a commoner, and one word becomes the law of the world." (This is a quote from Su Shi's "Han Wengong Temple Stele in Chaozhou.") Li Bai also said, "In life, there is no need to be granted ten thousand households, but I wish to meet Han Jingzhou. The system is modeled on the gods, and virtue moves heaven and earth." (Also see the above "Letter to Han Jingzhou.")

What Mr. Jingyuan said must be a temporary mistake. According to the historical record, Li Bai served as a Hanlin scholar in the early years of Emperor Xuanzong's Tianbao era, and was greatly loved and respected. Then, this self-recommending letter must have been written in the middle of the Kaiyuan era. However, Han Yu was born in the third year of the Dali era, and only passed the jinshi examination and entered the officialdom during the Zhenyuan era. Therefore, when Li Bai wrote the letter, Han Yu had not yet been born.

To whom was Li Bai writing this letter? According to the "Biography of Han Sifu" in the "Book of Tang": "Sifu's courtesy name was Chaozong. He first served as a left remonstrance official. During the Kaiyuan era, he was the prefect of Jingzhou. He was good at identifying and promoting younger generations, and the scholars of the time all respected him."

Therefore, Li Bai wrote the letter to seek recognition and hoped to be promoted, but it had nothing to do with Han Yu.

Father Yin Pinjun Han said that the Tang Shu says "Han Sifu, courtesy name Chaozong, first calendar Zuoshi Yiyi, Kaiyuan Zhongwei Jingzhou Zhangshi, likes to recognize and promote the younger generations, at that time the scholars all returned to him."

Tangyin Guiquanzai a Li Bai, a Tangren, courtesy name Taibai, was born in Qinglian Township, Shuchangming, and was known as Qinglian Jushi, a genius and hero, and He Zhizhang saw his text and sighed for a sage, and said to Xuanzong, offering the Hanlin, and was very loved and respected, and later sat in Changliu Yalang, met the pardon and returned, and his poems were highly ingenious, and Du Fu was called the patriarch of poetry together……"

According to the steel mirror, Kaiyuan is the year number of Xuanzong, and Han Chaozong and Li Bai were born in the same era, so Li Bai could ask Han Chaozong to identify and promote him. Then look at Han's small biography——

Han Yu, courtesy name Tuizhi, was a native of Nanyang, Dengzhou. He was promoted to the jinshi rank and held various positions up to the position of vice minister of the Ministry of Personnel. He was honest and outspoken in the court. During the reign of Emperor Dezong, he submitted a memorial strongly criticizing the palace market. During the reign of Emperor Xianzong, he remonstrated against welcoming the Buddha's bones, and was demoted. He had benevolent policies in the outside world and was the prefect of Chaozhou, and the people especially appreciated him. He died with the title Wen. Yu was familiar with the classics and hundreds of schools, and his writings were deeply rooted in the origins, broad, profound, and esoteric, and were especially admired by later generations. His ancestors lived in Changli. In the Song Dynasty's Yuanfeng era, he was posthumously awarded the title of Earl of Changli, so he was known as Han Changli.

According to the steel mirror, Dezong was the year number in the middle, and Xuanzong ascended the throne 68 years later.

The Xa Wang Yunwu dictionary says: "Li Bai was born in the year 701 AD and died in 762 AD." "Han Yu was born in the year 768 AD and died in 824 AD. (Remuneration for the Shen Bao Scholarship Fund)"

Editor's Note: In addition, letters from Luo Xinpu, Gu Zhaoyi, Xintang, Yinchang, Zheng Mouben, Guanyu and other gentlemen have been received, pointing out some corrections, which show the true frequency of readers' teachings. They are hereby published and thanked.

### Sharing the Same Boat in Storm

— He Jia Zhi

(8) What to do

The Ye family almost all went out and ran to Cui Zhen's room in the back courtyard. The quilt on the bed was gone; the person was also gone. Inside the door, Mother He picked up a gray cloth shoe with white piping. The shoe was exactly Cui Zhen's daily shoe, but there was only one. There were knife marks on the door frame, and it was speculated that Cui Zhen closed the door to sleep, and the robbers pried open her door with a knife, then rolled up the quilt and dragged Cui Zhen out. At the door, one of her shoes fell off.

All the houses of the Ye family were searched, but Cui Zhen was not found. Mrs. Ye Er began to panic, and Wei Cheng fell back on the rattan chair in a distraught state. A Xing and the others ran out of the fence to look for footprints on the ground, and to see where the robbers came from and where they went. This couldn't be like the snow a few days ago, where someone left a print for every step they took in the snow. Now, not only had the snow melted, but even the ground was dry. On the road outside, people were going from west to east to Huagang. Seeing the Ye family arguing at the door, they asked what was going on. A Xing said: "We were robbed last night." The person who asked also exclaimed in surprise and sighed, asking how much was stolen. A Xing said: "It doesn't matter that things were stolen, but a young lady was also robbed." Idlers are the best at speaking fair words, and he said, "Ah! This trend cannot be allowed to continue! You should report to the authorities. Our village has been peaceful for several years. If you don't report to the authorities, the Zhang family will be robbed tomorrow, and the Li family will be robbed the day after tomorrow. That would be terrible." A Xing brought the idler's suggestion back to Wei Cheng. Mrs. Ye Er, Xique, and others had already found out that only a pair of silver bracelets and more than one hundred yuan had been robbed from Mrs. Ye Er's room. The other locked drawers, cabinets, and boxes had not been opened at all. Cui Zhen also had some private savings, which were still well placed under her pillow. Wei Cheng's room was not even entered, let alone ransacked. Wei Cheng stood up from the rattan chair again and said, "It is obvious that the goal is Cui Zhen. As for the jewelry and silver, at least it is a secondary goal; even it can be said that it is not their goal at all." (163)
