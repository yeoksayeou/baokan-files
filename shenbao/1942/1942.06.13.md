### The Port of Sevastopol: German and Soviet Forces Engage in Bloody Battle; Nine-Mile Narrow Front Witnesses Successive Attacks and Heavy Casualties; Large-Scale Air Battles Over the Black Sea and Arctic Ocean

Swiss Capital, 12th, Allied Press Dispatch: The Soviet front line's battle reached its peak this year last night. In the land wars of the two major battlefields of Crimea and Ukraine, German and Soviet forces are still locked in bloody combat in the Sevastopol area. Sevastopol is the last stronghold of the Soviet army in Crimea and the direction of Kharkov. Reports reaching here indicate that in addition to land warfare, there have been large-scale air battles on the flanks of the Black Sea and the Arctic Ocean. The reports also stated that the German army has successively repelled the Soviet army's counter-offensives in Sevastopol and Kharkov.

Lisbon, 11th, Allied Press Dispatch: Sources here say that on the night of the 10th, the German army on the Kharkov front launched a fierce attack on the Ukrainian corps under the command of Timoshenko. Led by General Hoth, the German army is carrying out a large-scale encirclement and annihilation operation against the Soviet army. After the success of the previous battle, they immediately prepared for a new offensive, launching a sudden and fierce attack on the Soviet army's positions on the night of the 10th. Fierce fighting broke out on the entire Kharkov front. The Soviet Information Bureau had already acknowledged this on the night of the 10th and briefly announced the fact that the German army had launched a fierce attack on the Kharkov front on the night of the 10th.

German Headquarters, 12th, Havas: This afternoon's German military report stated that in the fierce battles in many places within the Soviet fortress of Sevastopol, the German army continued to make progress. The Soviet army's repeated counter-offensives were all crushed, resulting in heavy losses. German bomber groups continued to bomb the Soviet army's deep trenches and high ramparts. German forces were active elsewhere. Our forces east of Kharkov are fighting particularly hard.

Swedish Capital, 12th, Havas: In the battle between German and Soviet forces for Sevastopol, reinforcements are constantly arriving, advancing in waves. The German army attacks strongholds, while the Red Army tenaciously defends them. The battle is rapidly reaching its climax. Soviet reports say that the German army has suffered heavy casualties, while the German side says that these casualties can be replenished. The troops concentrated in front of Sevastopol are fully manned and sufficient to complete the attack mission, especially since the German army has gained air supremacy. However, the Red Army is not showing weakness and is constantly launching powerful counter-offensives. However, these counter-offensives can only delay the time and consume the German side's strength, given that they are outnumbered. The Sevastopol front line is only nine miles long. The amount of heavy artillery concentrated by both sides in this narrow combat zone is astonishing, and the caliber of the artillery is unprecedented since the beginning of the war. German battlefield reporters all admit that the German army is facing unprecedented difficulties in its attack. It is expected that it will take a considerable amount of time before it can be captured.

Berlin, 12th, Havas: According to German authoritative authorities last night, the German army is continuing its fierce attack on the Soviet army's strong fortresses in Sevastopol. The Soviet army is still resisting desperately. On Wednesday, German stormtroopers repelled another Soviet counter-offensive, inflicting heavy losses on the enemy. The German army is constantly bombarding the enemy's positions with artillery fire, so the fighting there is exceptionally fierce. The German air force is providing extremely effective support, and enemy military targets are constantly being bombed. On Wednesday, one enemy ship was sunk. The German army has also achieved victories in other positions on the Eastern Front. The enemy has built its artillery emplacements in forests and swampy areas. Berlin revealed on Wednesday that in the past three days, the German army destroyed 483 enemy fortresses on the northern route. On Wednesday, another 107 were destroyed, which shows the fullness of the German army's combat power. In the Volkhov area, the Soviet army attempted to seize German outposts, but all failed. Twenty-four Soviet tanks were destroyed in two days.

Somewhere on the Ukrainian Border, 11th, Havas: The port of Yana, in the Taman Peninsula occupied by the German army, is a vital location on the Black Sea coast, located about 25 miles northwest of Novorossiysk. The remains of an 18th-century Turkish fortress are still there. The port has a population of about 15,000. After the German army controlled the port, the Red Army in the North Caucasus and Transcaucasus is in danger of being isolated. Moreover, the garrison on the Taman Peninsula has only two routes to communicate with the mainland. After the fall of the port, the southern route has been blocked. The Red Army concentrated on the peninsula can only follow the northern route along the Sea of Azov, which has a serious impact.

### British Acknowledge in Cairo: Bir Hakeim Has Fallen; Germany and Italy Announce the Capture of 2,000 Men; New Battle in North Africa Is About to Begin

Rome, 12th, Havas: Today's Italian military report stated that the defenses of Bir Hakeim were strong. They have now been broken by German and Italian mechanized units and occupied yesterday morning. The air force's assistance was greatly meritorious. More than 2,000 enemy troops were captured, and a large number of spoils of war and vehicles were seized. Armored patrol vehicles of the British army north of Bir Hakeim attempted to advance, but were severely damaged and repelled by us. The enemy's rear positions were also attacked by the air force. Many armored vehicles and supply vehicles were hit and caught fire. In the air battle, German aircraft shot down five enemy aircraft. One of our destroyers in the Mediterranean was hit and sunk by an enemy torpedo. Another hit a mine and sank. Most of the crew members were rescued. The number of casualties in the Taranto air raid has now increased from twenty to forty-one. Many bombs were dropped on the outskirts of Taranto last night, but there was no damage or casualties.

Berlin, 12th, Havas: German officials claimed that the German-Italian Allied forces captured 2,000 men when they occupied Bir Hakeim, and seized or destroyed 24 enemy artillery pieces. Hundreds of motorcycles were seized or destroyed, which proves that the British claim that the British army and the Free French forces voluntarily withdrew from Bir Hakeim is not credible.

Cairo, 11th, Havas: The British General Headquarters has just issued a military report stating that the garrison of Bir Hakeim withdrew from the city last night on the orders of General Ritchie. Most of these troops were "Free Frenchmen" under the command of General Koenig, and had resisted for sixteen days.

Swedish Capital, 12th, Havas: A London telegram stated that the British's last report on the situation in Bir Hakeim arrived in London three hours before the place fell. It was said that after the German army's artillery and aircraft fiercely bombed Bir Hakeim, the German armored units attacked the place from three directions. Our losses were heavy, and the situation was critical. The southern positions were attacked from three sides and had no strength to continue resisting. Three hours later, the British Exchange Telegraph Agency discovered that the telegraph communication with Bir Hakeim had been interrupted.

Berlin, 12th, Havas: Military circles pointed out that the fall of Bir Hakeim has greatly enhanced the position of the Axis forces. That place is the most important base and transportation point for British defense. General Rommel's capture of that fortress signifies the end of the second phase of the war. The first phase ended with the capture of 10,000 enemy troops. Now a new battle is about to begin, and its impact on the future is also extremely far-reaching.

Swedish Capital, 12th, Havas: General Koenig, commander of the Bir Hakeim Free French forces, was only a lieutenant when he participated in the Norwegian campaign two years ago. Although he has a German surname, he is actually French. His ancestors were Alsatians who moved to France after 1871. Regarding the importance of Bir Hakeim, the British Daily Express wrote an article on the eve of the city's fall. It was said that if the Axis forces could occupy Bir Hakeim, it would create a new situation for the German army's attack on Tobruk. General Rommel's transportation problems could also be greatly facilitated.

### Results of Air Battles in New Guinea

Tokyo, 12th, Allied Press Dispatch: According to a telegram from a certain base, the Japanese Navy has been quite active in the New Guinea area under the equator in recent days, and has fiercely bombed various key enemy locations such as Port Moresby, threatening the isolated Pacific island of Australia.

### Another American Merchant Ship Sunk

Lisbon, 11th, Allied Press Dispatch: According to a Washington telegram, the US Navy Department has just announced that an American merchant ship was attacked by an Axis torpedo on the US Atlantic coast.

Washington, 11th, Havas: The Navy Department issued a communiqué today stating that an American cargo ship was sunk by a submarine with artillery shells in the Atlantic Ocean. Many rescued sailors have landed at a certain port in the east.

Lisbon, 12th, Havas: The latest issue of the American magazine Time commented on the loss of American ships, saying that the protection of American coastal shipping is very unlikely, because the US Navy is more urgently needed elsewhere. The United States is currently using small airships as the only weapon to defend against submarines. There are currently three small airship stations on the American coast, and several more are under construction. However, this weapon is difficult to use on a large scale, because the construction of airship stations takes a long time. Therefore, the only way to overcome the difficulties of shipping is to switch to air transport. However, to transport 20 million tons of cargo, 40,000 aircraft are needed, and it will take three years to reach this number.

### Japanese Recruits Will Learn Chinese and Malay

### The Duke of Gloucester Suddenly Arrives in India; Broadcasts the King's Statement Yesterday

Tokyo, 12th, Allied Press Dispatch: According to a Saigon telegram from the Nichinichi Shimbun, the Duke of Gloucester, the brother of the British King, suddenly flew to Karachi on the 11th. A few days ago, he also toured Cairo, Cyprus, Sares, Iran, and other places. After inspecting the British and Indian troops there, he suddenly flew to India to visit various parts of India as the King's representative. The surface reason is to discuss military issues with Indian military leaders, but according to general observations, it is believed that this move is to hold talks with representatives of various factions in India. Following Cripps, this is a means of appeasement towards India. At 8:30 AM on the 12th, the Duke of Gloucester broadcast the King's statement to the Indian people in New Delhi. From this, it can be seen how distressed Britain feels about the anti-British movement in India.

### Soviet, British, and American Agreement: The Goal Is in Europe; The Soviet Union Maintains Neutrality Towards the East

Tokyo, 12th, Allied Press Dispatch: Regarding Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov's visit to Roosevelt in the United States, although the United States has not made any formal announcements, according to foreign dispatches, the content of the Molotov-Roosevelt talks will mainly focus on two issues: the transportation of aid to the Soviet Union and the creation of a second front in Europe. The East Asian issue will not be of particular importance. The Soviet Union will continue to maintain its neutral attitude in accordance with the Japanese-Soviet Neutrality Treaty. Also, the main points of the talks will be to review how to actually implement both aid to the Soviet Union and the European second front in light of all circumstances. However, the desire for the rapid development of these two matters is not smooth at the moment. Therefore, the holding of the British-American-Soviet talks will have, at most, a propaganda effect. It is doubtful whether it will have any major impact on international politics.

Lisbon, 11th, Allied Press Dispatch: Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov secretly visited London and Washington to discuss strengthening the mutual assistance work of the three countries.

The Soviet Union has repeatedly asked Britain and the United States to provide more military equipment and open a second front. Sources here expect Molotov to visit Britain and the United States for negotiations. At present, Molotov's visit has been realized, which is clear evidence of the severity of the Soviet situation. Stalin had to send his confidant to visit democratic countries to explain the difficulties of the Soviet Union's situation.

At the same time, the two countries reached a complete understanding, agreeing to open a second front in 1942. The White House immediately announced the agreement after its establishment yesterday. The agreement was signed by Secretary of State Hull and Litvinov. Its content is the same as that signed by the United Kingdom and the United States, and it stipulates cooperation in post-war economic relations. This move by the United States clearly aims to divert the attention of the people after the attacks suffered in Dutch Harbor and Midway Island in the Aleutian Islands. The agreement was facilitated by Soviet Foreign Commissar Molotov. According to the White House press release, those who participated in the talks included Litvinov, Lend-Lease Administrator Hopkins, Admiral King, Commander-in-Chief of the United States Navy, and Secretary of State Hull. The press release also stated that during the talks, a complete understanding was reached on the urgent and important task of opening a second front in 1942.

Lisbon, 11th (Allied Press) - According to a report from Washington, the White House announced to the press that the United States and the Soviet Union have reached an understanding on joint operations. It stated briefly that Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Molotov, at the invitation of the U.S. President, arrived in Washington to exchange views. In addition to President Roosevelt and Molotov, those who participated in the meeting included Soviet Ambassador Litvinov, U.S. Lend-Lease Administrator Hopkins, Army Chief of Staff Marshall, Admiral King, Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Fleet, etc. Secretary of State Hull also attended in addition to the discussion of military matters.

Various measures, such as increasing and promoting U.S. aid to the Soviet Union in the form of aircraft, tanks, and other military supplies, were also discussed. Basic issues of U.S.-Soviet cooperation aimed at guaranteeing post-war peace and security were also discussed, and the opinions of both sides converged.

Lisbon, 11th (Central News Agency) - According to a report from Washington, the U.S. State Department announced today that the U.S. and the Soviet Union have concluded a new economic agreement in addition to the U.S.-Soviet agreement. The economic agreement is aimed at providing material aid to the Soviet Union. Its contents are as follows: 1. The United States will supply the Soviet Union with food and materials in accordance with the Lend-Lease Act, but the payment deadline will be negotiated separately. 2. The agreement stipulates the principles of establishing economic institutions for peace and after the war. 3. The agreement includes post-war issues such as production and the exchange of materials. 4. The agreement abolishes discriminatory treatment in trade and commerce between the two countries. 5. The agreement abolishes protective tariffs and other obstacles to commerce. 6. The agreement achieves the economic goals stated in the Atlantic Charter. The United States believes that this economic agreement can be called the "economic charter" of the U.S.-Soviet "alliance" during wartime and after the war. The Anglo-Soviet treaty and the U.S.-Soviet agreement are evidence of the common cooperation between the UK, the US, and the Soviet Union on European issues.

Lisbon, 12th (Reuters) - According to reports from New York, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov traveled to the United States from London on a Soviet four-engine bomber and arrived in Washington on May 29. However, it was not until yesterday morning, after confirming that Molotov had safely returned to the Soviet Union, that the news of his visit to the United States was made public. Molotov was accompanied by several military and diplomatic advisors. U.S. Secretary of State Hull and other senior officials welcomed him at the airport. While in Washington, Molotov spent most of his time at the White House and used the alias "Brown" to the outside world. Molotov left the United States on the original plane on June 4, returning to the Soviet Union via the United Kingdom.

Lisbon, 12th (Reuters) - According to yesterday's announcement from Washington, the sole purpose of Molotov's visit to Washington was to discuss with President Roosevelt the increase in the shipment of war materials to the Soviet Union. However, the U.S. and the Soviet Union are also seeking to establish a military agreement.

Stockholm, 12th (Reuters) - According to reports from Moscow, Molotov arrived in Washington on May 29, and President Roosevelt received him. Litvinov, the Soviet ambassador to the United States, also participated when Molotov and Hopkins held negotiations. Hopkins had served as President Roosevelt's special envoy to visit Moscow. After the negotiations, Roosevelt asked Molotov to convey his regards to Stalin, emphasizing the important role of the Soviet Union in the war.

Lisbon, 12th (Reuters) - Washington dispatches, U.S. Republican Senator Nye of North Dakota, commented on Molotov's trip to Washington, saying that the opening of a second front against Germany should have been implemented long ago, but it should not be opened by the U.S. military alone. New York radio stations said that most U.S. senators advocated opening a second front. A White House spokesperson made a brief statement, saying that a complete understanding was reached during Molotov's talks in Washington on opening a second front this year. The U.S. State Department also maintained close contact with Molotov during his talks in London. Among those who attended the military talks in Washington were U.S. Army Chief of Staff General Marshall and Admiral King, Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Fleet.

Afterwards, the two exchanged short words. Foreign Secretary Eden said first that the mutual understanding that the UK and the Soviet Union had failed to achieve in peacetime was finally achieved at the last moment, which is gratifying. The UK's commitment to resist the common enemy will not be broken, and efforts will be made to seek a consolidated and lasting peace. The relationship between the UK and the Soviet Union has never been as close as it is today in history, and the agreement signed by the two countries this time is not exclusive in nature and welcomes the unanimous participation of other allied countries. Ambassador Maisky made special contributions to this negotiation, which I admire very much. Then Commissar Molotov replied, stating that the people of the Soviet Union and the signing of the agreement between the UK and the Soviet Union would all express satisfaction. I am deeply grateful for the frank cooperation of the British government, especially Prime Minister Churchill and Foreign Secretary Eden. On the day after the signing, King George VI of England and Chairman Kalinin of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, Prime Minister Churchill and Stalin, all exchanged congratulations by telegram, with the same content.

London, 11th (Havas) - Foreign Secretary Eden announced in the House of Commons today that Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Molotov came to London last month to hold talks with our country, and then signed the Anglo-Soviet Treaty on the 25th. Molotov then flew to Washington on the 29th to visit President Roosevelt, and did not leave the United States to return to his country until the 6th of this month. The Anglo-Soviet agreement stipulates that neither signatory can make peace separately and includes a declaration stating that neither party has any territorial demands. The UK and the Soviet Union both agreed that it was necessary to open a second front this year and agreed to continue to cooperate and assist each other after the war to prevent further attacks from the Axis powers. Furthermore, according to official announcements, the representatives of the two sides during the talks between the British and Soviet authorities were as follows: the Soviet side was represented by Foreign People's Commissar Molotov, Ambassador Maisky to Great Britain, Army Attaché General Shev, Navy Attaché Rear Admiral Varlamov. The British representatives were Prime Minister Churchill, Deputy Prime Minister Major Attlee, Foreign Secretary Eden, and the commanders-in-chief of the Navy, Army, and Air Force.

Stockholm, 12th (Reuters) - London dispatches, British Foreign Secretary Eden announced in the Lower House yesterday that the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union had established an agreement stipulating that the two countries shall not negotiate peace separately, shall not aim to occupy land, and shall be military allies during the continuation of the war. Within twenty years after the announcement of peace, the two sides shall obey the provisions of the mutual assistance treaty.

Stockholm, 12th (Reuters) - According to Moscow reports, the signing of the Anglo-Soviet military agreement was the result of British Foreign Secretary Eden's visit to the Soviet Union last December and the start of negotiations with Stalin and Molotov. Molotov made a speech after signing the military agreement in London, saying that the bridge between the UK and the Soviet Union has been completed and the Allied countries must win the war. Eden replied, saying that the whole world is currently in the midst of artillery fire. The UK and the Soviet Union have sought to achieve understanding, and the future peace will be maintained by the cooperation of the UK and the Soviet Union.

Stockholm, 12th (Reuters) - Regarding the new Anglo-Soviet agreement, the British Foreign Office announced last night, emphasizing that the treaty signed by Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov and British Foreign Secretary Eden was extremely frank and pleasant during the discussions. Soviet Ambassador Maisky and British Foreign Office Permanent Under-Secretary Cadogan also participated. The announcement continued that the two governments believed that the treaty would become the cornerstone of good relations between the two countries in the future and would enhance the relationship between the Soviet Union, the UK, and the US. Both sides also believed that the treaty would be a powerful weapon to resist Germany and would guarantee cooperation between the two countries after the war. An understanding has also been reached on the issue of opening a second front in Europe this year, and the increase in the shipment of war materials to the Soviet Union has also been discussed.

### No Agreement Reached on Soviet Union's Post-War Borders

Stockholm, 12th (Reuters) - Today, Swedish newspapers reported that London's comments on the Anglo-Soviet treaty pointed out that the issue of the Soviet Union's post-war borders had not been agreed upon. "Nyheter" wrote that during the Anglo-Soviet negotiations, it was originally intended to write these borders into the treaty, but one party refused, so this did not become a reality. People in London believed that this move would please the United States, Poland, and Turkey. "Dagens Bladet" carried a telegram from a London correspondent, saying that London political figures were very surprised by the intention of the Anglo-Saxon countries to establish a second front in Europe this year. The general public's fear was that this move would have a significant moral impact on the UK, the US, and the Soviet Union. The correspondent continued, saying that the announcement of this plan by the Anglo-Saxon countries proved that the UK's current air offensive against Germany could not be regarded as an action to establish a second front, and that British and American troops had to land on the European continent. "Svenska Dagbladet" wrote that the Anglo-Soviet treaty was written in both English and Russian and was attached with dark blue silk emperors. Both were attached with the red seals of the foreign ministers of the two countries. When Molotov was in London, he met with all the members of the British cabinet and went to the bombed areas of London to inspect the damage. The head of the Soviet delegation to the Army and Navy also went to Washington with Molotov. It is said that Molotov conducted very detailed discussions on military issues during his negotiations in London and Washington, basing his negotiations on the Anglo-American strategic agreement signed during U.S. Chief of Staff Marshall's visit to London.

Stockholm, 12th (Reuters) - This morning, Swedish newspapers revealed detailed contents of the Anglo-Soviet military and economic agreement, including those that have not yet been revealed to the world. The report cited London dispatches pointing out that the new Anglo-Soviet treaty did not mention anything about the Soviet Union's future borders in Europe. However, before the signing of the treaty, the two sides had negotiated for five months, and it was not impossible that they had discussed in detail and even decided on the Soviet Union's post-war borders. Commentators said that Article 5 of the treaty, which recognized the need to guarantee each other's security, implied acceptance of the Soviet Union's request for a militarily advantageous western border. When Eden reported to Moscow, Stalin expressed his personal views on post-war borders, which was the beginning of the negotiations. After listening, Eden declared to Stalin that he was willing to convey everything he had heard to the British wartime cabinet. During the talks, Stalin emphasized the need to restore the western border of the Soviet Union as of June 22, 1941, such as the eastern part of Poland, Bukovina, Bessarabia, and the territories ceded to the Soviet Union by Finland. At the same time, Stalin assured Eden that he fully understood Britain's interests in the Mediterranean and Africa, and Britain's need to obtain naval bases on the western coast of France. He also emphasized that the Soviet Union needed to obtain freedom of access to the Baltic Sea and the Black Sea. Finally, Stalin demanded a solution to the Yugoslavian border issue. After Eden returned to London, negotiations continued, with Soviet Ambassador to the UK Maisky participating in the discussions, and progress was smoother. On March 12, Churchill sent a letter to Stalin, in addition to expressing admiration for the Red Army's achievements in Eastern Europe, stating his desire for the UK and the Soviet Union to conclude an alliance, but the contents of this treaty must be notified to the US government and must not contain secret clauses. At this time, the United States had revealed its unwillingness to participate in the Anglo-Soviet alliance. Roosevelt believed that it was unwise to subordinate the eastern part of Poland to the Soviet Union. On the 16th of the same month, Maisky presented Stalin's reply to Churchill in front of Eden. Stalin agreed to inform the US government of the progress of the negotiations at any time and agreed to publish it if an agreement was signed. At the same time, he expressed his belief that Germany would be defeated this year. Eden repeatedly invited Molotov to come to the UK to discuss major issues. Molotov initially declined, but finally accepted the invitation and went to the UK. At that time, Roosevelt invited Stalin to Washington to discuss important matters. For various reasons, Stalin could not agree. Molotov then decided to visit the UK first and then go to Washington, first to discuss the overall operational plan and second to revise the contract for the delivery of munitions, because the contract signed when Lord Beaverbrook and Harriman reported to Moscow would expire on July 1. At this time, the Polish government-in-exile, having learned of the Anglo-Soviet negotiations, was greatly alarmed, and General Sikorski personally went to Washington to take advantage of the situation. Now let us briefly describe Molotov's visit to the UK and its gains. On May 20, Molotov arrived at the Scottish airfield. Ten officials accompanied him to the UK. Eden personally went to the airfield to welcome him. The negotiations began on May 22 and ended on the 25th. In addition to the important personnel accompanying Molotov, Ambassador Maisky and the Soviet military and naval attachés to the UK also attended the discussions. From this, one can see the special importance of military issues. After several meetings, the new Anglo-Soviet treaty was signed on the evening of May 26 in the office of the Foreign Secretary. Prime Minister Churchill and Sir Sinclair were present to celebrate the success of the treaty. Half an hour later, Molotov set off for the United States. Eden met with the Turkish ambassador to the UK and the foreign minister of the Polish government-in-exile before signing the treaty to inform them that the UK and the Soviet Union were about to sign an agreement, and it seemed that he no longer had time to consider the attitudes of other countries.

The issue of disarmament was also not mentioned. Stockholm, 12th (Reuters) - "Nyheter" wrote in today's editorial that the last world war had published a peace plan, but the treaty signed by the UK and the Soviet Union did not mention the reduction of armaments. On the contrary, the UK and the Soviet Union both want to use force to defend the new Europe they want to create. The UK is now vigorously promoting this Anglo-Soviet treaty. Considering the goals of the UK, the US, and the Soviet Union, it is to counter Germany's post-war plan. According to a dispatch from a London correspondent in Swedish newspapers, Molotov stopped in London for two days on his way back to Moscow from Washington, apparently to inform the British government of the results of his negotiations with Roosevelt. It is known that Molotov's visit to Washington resulted in two major achievements: 1. The United States will supply the Soviet Union with unlimited military supplies in accordance with the Lend-Lease Act. 2. The Soviet Union agrees to the U.S. government's international trade policy, meaning that the Soviet Union will no longer insist on self-sufficiency. "Svenska Dagbladet" wrote that regarding the issue of the second front, the people of London still do not know when and where it should be. It is generally expected that it will not become a reality before the fall of this year. The newspaper continued that Churchill and Eden had arranged everything for Molotov's visit to Washington for negotiations.

Difficulties in transporting aid to the Soviet Union. Tokyo, 12th (Allied Press) - According to the White House in the U.S., the UK, the US, and the Soviet Union have reached a consensus on issues such as promoting the transportation of aid to the Soviet Union, opening a second front, and post-war reconstruction. However, according to various opinions, due to the recent shortage of ships on the United Nations side and the obstruction of sea routes, it is feared that the transportation of aid to the Soviet Union will not have any effect. Moreover, because the United States' aid to the Soviet Union in accordance with the Lend-Lease Act is only empty talk, the Soviet Union, under the fierce German offensive, sent Molotov to the United States to urge the country to promote its aid to the Soviet Union. As for the issue of the second front, the Soviet Union is also urging it very urgently. However, the US is short of ships and its combat power is low, so only the UK is bombing southwestern Germany with its air force to muddle along. Regarding the issue of post-war reconstruction, in the past, when Soviet Ambassador to the US Litvinov and Hull negotiated, the United States' post-war countermeasures based on the "Atlantic Charter" were clearly different from the Soviet Union's views, and the conflicting views between the US and the Soviet Union had also become ossified. In this embarrassing situation, the United States encouraged Molotov to visit the United States to exchange views in order to slightly appease the Soviet Union.

### Former Burmese Prime Minister Ba Saw Still in Prison

London, June 11th, Reuter - The Minister for Indian and Burmese Affairs, Mr. Amery, stated in the House of Commons today that the former Prime Minister of Burma, Ba Saw, is currently still in prison. The current Burmese Prime Minister and Finance Minister are serving in the interim government of India and Burma.

### 4. Palestine, the Religious Holy Land

What kind of paradise is it exactly?

Palestine is bordered by the Mediterranean Sea to the west, Syria to the north, Egypt to the southwest, and Transjordan to the east, with the Jordan River as the boundary. It covers an area of approximately nine thousand square miles, with a population of about one million, roughly equivalent to a quarter of Jiangsu Province in China. Its terrain is high on all sides and low in the middle. The lowest point is the Dead Sea. The Dead Sea's water surface is 1,300 feet below sea level, making it the lowest water surface in the world. The Dead Sea's water contains a high amount of salt, making it impossible for fish to live, hence the name Dead Sea. Because it contains many minerals, the specific gravity of the Dead Sea water is 1.2. People can easily float in the Dead Sea, so there is no danger of drowning. Among the minerals in the Dead Sea water, potassium salt is the most abundant. Therefore, since World War I, when the British recruited Jews to return to their homeland in Palestine, the Jews have found ways to extract potassium from the Dead Sea water, with considerable success. Germany has also paid close attention to the potassium salt in the Dead Sea water.

The Dead Sea is narrow and elongated, 46 miles long and an average of 8 miles wide, containing 25% salt. Some estimate that it contains 100 billion tons of potassium carbonate, 85 million tons of bromine, over 100 billion tons of , and over 20 billion tons of magnesium chloride.

In terms of agricultural products, Palestine produces barley, wheat, olives, figs, Arab dates, grapes, oranges, lemons, etc. In terms of mineral products, it has stone materials, gypsum, salt, etc. Coastal fishing is quite prosperous. Animal husbandry is prevalent in the hilly areas, with goats, sheep, and camels being the main livestock.

Regarding transportation in Palestine, there is a railway running vertically. The section connecting Cairo was built by the British for military use during World War I. During World War I, when the British failed to capture the Turkish Straits, they devised a plan to use guerrilla tactics from the Arabian Peninsula to contain the Turkish army on one hand, and on the other hand, General Allenby led the British army from Egypt across the Sinai Peninsula directly to Palestine, shaking the military position of the Turkish Empire, which is the railway they took. As for sea routes, there are the ports of Jaffa and Haifa, which are the centers of overseas navigation.

The inhabitants of Palestine consist of Arabs, who account for six-eighths of the population, and Jews, who account for one-eighth. With the help of the British, the number of Jews continues to increase there, which is no wonder that the Arabs are dismayed. Their numbers increased from 58,000 in 1920 to 140,000 in 1931. Out of the 16 million Jews worldwide, one-tenth are already here.

Here is the holy city of Jerusalem—the holy city for Christians and also the holy city for Muslims—now the capital of the mandated territory, located in central Palestine, northwest of the Dead Sea, built on a mountaintop over 2,500 feet above sea level. Here is Bethlehem, the birthplace of Jesus Christ. The people here, divided by religion, include Jews who believe in Judaism, Christians who believe in Christianity, and Syrians who believe in Islam.

Its important ports include Jaffa and Haifa. Jaffa is located northwest of Jerusalem on the coast and has a railway connection to Jerusalem. Many who come to worship at the holy land land here. The nearby area produces many oranges, which are exported from here. Haifa is north of Jaffa, on the coast and also connected by railway, and is also an important commercial port. Since the British began operating the Su Oilfields (in Iraq), they have built over a thousand miles of pipelines directly to Haifa. The oil is transferred from the pipelines to oil tankers in Haifa, which is very convenient, so Haifa is more important.

Palestine can be divided into two zones. The coastal area is a fertile Mediterranean region, producing oranges and other fruits. The hilly zone is where Jerusalem is located, which is quite cold in winter and produces olive trees. The deep valley region is where the Jordan River and the Dead Sea are located, where the weather is quite warm.

### Rationing by Population in the French Concession to Begin on the 20th of this Month; Landlords or Public Residence Managers Who Extort Residents Will Be Severely Punished

According to a report from a Datong News Agency reporter who inquired at the French Concession's Paocheng System Headquarters on Jinshenfu Road, residents of the French Concession are currently applying for identity cards, but they have not yet been issued. However, the rationing system in the French Concession will be implemented starting on the 20th of this month, regardless of whether the identity cards have been fully issued. Detailed and precise measures have already been drafted and will be announced soon. For residents who are subtenants, their applications must be guaranteed by the head of the household. Residents living in public residences must also be guaranteed by the manager of the public residence (who is also the head of the household). If landlords or public residence managers take this opportunity to increase rents or extort residents, once discovered, the French police will take the same attitude as the Public Concession Paocheng Guidance Department, namely, severely punish them, or even expel them from the concession.

### Major Industries in This City Will Not Accept Old Currency Starting on the 19th of This Month

According to the Allied News Agency, the Chinese Merchants Bank in this city has already stopped accepting old currency in order to help the National Government withdraw it. In addition, major Japanese companies and military-managed companies have decided to take the same measures starting on the 17th. It has now been decided that major Chinese-owned department stores, hotels, movie theaters, restaurants, and wholesale and retail merchants of silk, rayon, and woolen goods within the concessions will also refuse to accept old currency (subsidiary coins are not included) starting on June 19th, and will switch to transacting entirely in new legal tender. Regarding this matter, the China Liaison Department of the Asian Development Board announced on the 12th that transactions in major stores and companies within the concessions will be entirely converted to one type of new legal tender (except for military scrip transactions). Other small businesses, for their own benefit, will have no choice but to take the same measures. At the same time, regarding the full implementation of new legal tender transactions in the French Concession, the Japanese Consulate General in Shanghai is currently urging the French Concession's Municipal Council to realize it. Therefore, transactions in the Shanghai area will become entirely new legal tender. An official from the China Liaison Department of the Asian Development Board stated that major Japanese companies and military-managed companies will stop accepting old currency and switch to new legal tender transactions starting on June 17th to assist the new currency policy. The details have already been announced previously. Now, major Chinese-owned department stores, hotels, movie theaters, restaurants, and wholesale and retail merchants of rayon and cotton-woolen goods within the concessions, after consultation with the local authorities, have also decided to refuse to accept old currency starting on June 19th and to transact entirely in new currency. Therefore, in order to prevent the value of old currency from becoming unstable after the full exchange period, most Chinese merchants are quickly exchanging all old currency for new legal tender, hoping that all transactions will be calculated entirely in new legal tender. In addition, as a result of discussions between various industries and the authorities, the following major Chinese companies and stores will uniformly transact in new legal tender starting on June 19th:

Department Stores: Wing On, Sincere, The Sun, China National Goods, Whiteaway Laidlaw, Welfare, Lihua.

Hotels: Park Hotel, Cathay Hotel. Movie Theaters: Grand Theatre, Hukuang, New China, Paramount, Capitol, Greater Shanghai, Kincheng, Grand Cathay, Nanjing, and twelve others.

Silk Fabric Merchants: Member stores of the Shanghai Silk Fabric Trade Association, member stores of the Shanghai Cotton Fabric Trade Association, member stores of the China Woolen Textile Production and Sales Association.

### Silver and Money Businesses Stop Accepting Old Currency; No Accommodation for Old Currency for Debt Repayment or Withdrawals; Depositors Must First Exchange for Central Reserve Bank Notes

The Provisional United Association of Members of the Silver and Money Industry received a letter from the Japanese Finance Officer stating that, except for handling the exchange of old legal tender on behalf of the Central Reserve Bank, all other receipts and payments of old legal tender should be stopped.

It is reported that various banks and money shops have recently decided that, starting today, only Central Reserve Bank notes will be accepted for debt repayment and withdrawals. Old legal tender will absolutely not be accommodated. Those who open accounts with old legal tender converted into Central Reserve Bank notes must first fill out an application to exchange old legal tender for Central Reserve Bank notes and can only deposit Central Reserve Bank notes after exchanging them. However, there are no restrictions on the exchange of old legal tender by various firms. Exchange is available at any time during the firm's business hours (9:00 AM to 3:00 PM).

### Asian Development Board to Investigate Factories in This City Starting Tomorrow to Ensure the Rational Development of Essential Goods Production and Improve Work Efficiency to Achieve Stable Livelihoods

In order to reorganize various industries in this city and create basic statistics, the Japanese have long planned to investigate the actual conditions of factories in this city, and the relevant Japanese authorities have been preparing step by step. It is reported that a comprehensive survey of factories in Shanghai will begin on June 15th. The China Liaison Department of the Asian Development Board summoned most of the relevant merchants on the 11th to explain the implementation methods and other matters and issued a statement.

Ensuring Rational Development of Production: The statement said that starting on June 15th, the Asian Development Board authorities will investigate factories in Shanghai, which will take about a month. This matter has also received the full assistance of the Public Works Department and the French Municipal Council. The plan includes surveying over 1,300 factories of all nationalities that usually employ 30 or more workers. Since the Pacific War, the operation of various factories has been very difficult. The main goal of this survey is to obtain the necessary information on production conditions and labor conditions in order to achieve stable livelihoods, ensure the production of essential goods, and rationally develop the Shanghai economy. Some factories that are currently closed or suspended may be necessary for stabilizing livelihoods in the future and may be reopened.

Investigative Work Carried Out in Groups: In this way, the Japanese may be able to increase the supply of raw materials and make the factory's production equipment more rationalized in order to improve work efficiency. In addition, the factory owners or managers of the factories to be investigated should assist the authorities in conducting the investigation and should not have any misunderstandings. As for the investigative work, several investigation teams will be formed according to the type of factory. Each team will consist of four people: one official from the Asian Development Board, one engineer, one patrolman, and one interpreter. All investigators will be equipped with an Asian Development Board investigation certificate and armband. If suspicious persons are encountered, the Asian Development Board must be notified immediately. Factory owners and managers should also pay attention not to reduce their normal work standards during the investigation.

### Shanghai Electric Power Company Changes Power Distribution Policy to Fully Supply Production and Severely Restrict Consumption; Power Supply Will Be Stopped After Two Instances of Overconsumption

The Shanghai Electric Power Company is one of the public utilities in this city. The electricity it supplies is the driving force behind Shanghai's production activities, so the method of its power distribution is particularly important. At the end of last year, due to the lack of coal, the company restricted and reduced the supply of electricity to all production and consumption needs.

Restriction Method

The initial restriction method was based on the consumption in the previous year, and the power distribution rates were as follows: Transportation and public utilities 70%, buildings and residences 60%, industry 45%, luxury goods 45%, entertainment 45%. Later, after the Japanese army moved into the concessions, the company was also under their management, but they did not change this distribution method.

Distribution Policy

Until recently, when the Japanese entrusted the China Hydroelectric Company to operate the Shanghai Electric Power Company, they re-established the distribution restriction method, with the new policy of fully supplying production electricity needs and severely restricting non-production electricity needs. The distribution rates have also changed as follows: Special industries 100%, transportation and public utilities 100%, buildings and residences 45%, ordinary industries (excluding food industries) 45%, luxury goods 40%, entertainment 45%.

Penalties for Overconsumption

As for ordinary households, the consumption limit is five KW per household per month. Those who exceed this amount must pay an excess fine in accordance with the regulations. In the past, the company only needed to fine these users slightly and continued to supply electricity. However, after the company was entrusted to operate, it has stipulated more severe measures, that is, if a user overconsumes electricity for the first time, in addition to the fine, the power distribution for the following month will be reduced. If there are two instances of overconsumption, the power supply will be terminated.

### Conte Verde Cruise Ship Postpones Carrying Overseas Chinese from Shanghai; Departure Set for the 23rd of This Month; 650 People to Evacuate by Ship

A reporter recently learned from authoritative sources that the Italian large passenger ship Conte Verde, which was assigned to carry American evacuees from China to Portuguese East Africa, will be delayed by one week and is scheduled to leave Shanghai on the 23rd or 24th of this month. 650 people will leave on this ship, but not all will depart from Shanghai. The ship will stop at other ports on its way to Africa to pick up evacuating diplomats and overseas Chinese on assigned duties from those locations and sail to their destination together. It is reported that the ship can accommodate 1,000 passengers, and it is currently only carrying 650 passengers, so there is plenty of space. Therefore, authoritative sources believe that the number of evacuees may increase until the ship is full. According to officials in charge of coordinating the evacuation of overseas Chinese, only a very small number of ordinary American overseas Chinese in this city will be on the evacuation list. The complete list will be finalized and announced one or two days before departure. It is reported that officials from Canada and South American countries will also be on the Conte Verde. It is also learned that a group of Allied officials and civilians from the Nanjing area, including 52 American diplomats and missionaries, arrived in Shanghai by train from Nanjing the day before yesterday. Among the American evacuees, 31 are from Nanjing, from Huaiyin, 2 from Zhenjiang, 1 from Changzhou, and 10 from other places along the Beijing-Shanghai line.

Evacuation List Continuously Revised: Although it has been declared by the relevant authorities that diplomatic and consular officials from the United States, Canada, and South American countries stationed in China will leave Shanghai for Portuguese East Africa in the middle of this month to exchange for Japanese officials gathered there, the actual situation is that the Japanese authorities and the Swiss Consulate General in Shanghai refuse to announce it. It is said that the list of evacuees that has been compiled, as corroborated by Swiss Vice Consul Dr. Schilling, will be continuously revised until the last minute before departure. Because those who are decided to be allowed to evacuate at the moment may not evacuate at that time. Announcing the list now will cause all kinds of unease and disappointment.

Some Details Awaiting Negotiation: However, the general public of foreigners believes that the number of Allied officials who may be evacuated in the middle of this month will not exceed 650, because most of them are ordinary people from various ports in North and South China. In recent days, people from Ping, Tianjin, Qingdao, Jinan, Zhifu, Nanjing, and other places have been arriving in Shanghai to gather and wait for evacuation. Some Americans living in Shanghai have prepared their luggage in case of evacuation, but most people doubt whether they also have the possibility of evacuation. Judging from the overall development of the case, there are definitely some final details regarding the exchange of officials and civilians that remain unresolved, so the haze has not yet cleared.

Conte Verde Trials in Japan: As for the Italian postal ship Conte Verde, which is scheduled to leave Shanghai for the Philippines in the middle of the month, after it suddenly sailed to Japan on Sunday night, there has been much speculation. However, the more reliable and consistent opinion is that the ship seems to have been leased by the Japanese naval authorities. This trip to Japan is to inspect the hull and machinery. When it returns to Shanghai, it may bring back Allied officials left in Japan. After the American, Canadian, and other officials and civilians in Shanghai board the ship, they will be carried to East Africa together, as the ship has many cabins and is enough to accommodate them. As for the evacuation of British officials, the Swiss Vice Consul said that it will be considered when the Japanese postal ships Tatsuta Maru or Kamakura Maru may sail from Shanghai to East Africa next month.

### Mingxin Establishes Summer Bookkeeping Class

The Mingxin Commercial Accounting School at No. 18, Alley 531, Henan Road in this city believes that businesses in Shanghai (especially sole proprietorships) do not pay much attention to accounting, so the accounts are not complete. However, since the Public Works Department opened the retail tax on June 1st, businesses have had to make accurate records of the accounts in order to ensure fair taxation. In order to meet the needs of various industries, the school has established a bookkeeping and accounting class during the summer vacation to quickly train accounting personnel. Classes are scheduled to start at the end of June. Industries that need to improve their accounting can send staff to join the school's morning and evening classes for study.

### Japanese Military Authorities Establish Enemy Property Management Committee to Handle the Assets and Enterprises of Enemy Countries and Nationals

According to the Allied News Agency, since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the Japanese Army and Navy authorities have taken various measures to handle all assets and enterprises of enemy countries and nationals. It is learned that the Japanese military authorities have established an Enemy Property Management Committee, which has already started working. The address is Branch 2 of the Asian Development Board at 2 Jiangwan Road. It is scheduled to move to the Naval Attaché Office at 27 Bund recently. The Japanese Fleet Reporting Department in China and the Shanghai Military Reporting Department jointly announced on the 11th that since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the Japanese Army and Navy have taken measures to seize materials, liquidate financial institutions, and take over factories for enemy countries and nationals' assets. This time, in order to properly handle all movable and immovable properties and enterprises of enemies in Central China (excluding the Wuhan area) and contribute to the construction of the Central China economy and the establishment of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, the Enemy Property Management Committee has been established, and preparations have been completed and work has begun. According to past facts, it is very clear that the examination and handling of enemy property has always been done fairly and properly. Those who have objections or wish to apply regarding the examination or handling should submit an application with supporting documents to the Enemy Property Management Committee through the nearby Kempeitai if the property is located in an army-guarded area, or through the Naval Attaché Office if it is in a navy-guarded area (for navy-guarded areas outside Shanghai, it should be submitted through the local navy garrison unit).

### Eagle Claw Hand, Nocturnal Eyes, Lion Face, Split Skin... A True Account of Leprosy Patients' Lives

— Jia Liang

Exerting Their Utmost to Survive, Courage Still Helps Themselves and Others, Friendly Spirit Abounds

In such a complex and bustling metropolis, full of stimulation and excitement, the movements of men and women, old and young, merge into a constant torrent of people. Who would think that in another corner of the same place, there is a group of people living a life isolated from the world because of their physical defects? They are not refugees displaced by war, nor are they beggars scorned and despised by society, but leprosy patients suffering from a contagious and deadly disease, who have no choice but to isolate themselves from the outside world.

They are housed in the Chinese Leprosy Hospital on Route Ghisi in western Shanghai. There are a total of one hundred and eight people, including young men of thirteen or fourteen years old whose childishness hasn't faded away, and old men of seventy who have lived a long life; there are so-called modern girls who have been baptized by the glamour of the metropolis, and there are also crude, seemingly semi-civilized old women from the countryside; there are pastors who always have the Bible in their hands and repent with every word about God, there are painters, there are writers, and there are also mentally challenged people who are illiterate. They come from different backgrounds, have different beliefs, different interests, and all kinds of differences. However, they suffer from the same disease, are isolated in the same hospital, receive the same treatment, and live the same life.

Although the hospital is not a tall building, but only a few thatched huts, it is small but complete. The houses in the front of the courtyard serve as passageways, pharmacies, weaving rooms, offices and libraries, etc. The courtyard is a large patio, with male and female patients on both sides. There are a total of seventy-three male patients, who are divided into two rooms according to the severity of their condition. Those suffering from lung disease are isolated separately for fear of infection. There are twenty-nine female patients, who live in a separate room. In the center of the patio is a chapel, with a large red cross hanging under the eaves. The chapel can accommodate hundreds of people, and a mirror frame is hung on the wall, on which is written "Christ is the Lord of this Hospital." To the left front of the patio are the clinic, laundry, and kitchen. Behind the chapel is an open space, which is used as a place for planting and animal husbandry.

The daily life of these "one hundred and eight heroes," although not strictly regulated by the hospital authorities, is worth mentioning for its automatic discipline. Except for those who are seriously ill and have to lie in bed and be served by others, the rest can at least take care of everything themselves. Laundry, spinning, carpentry, raising pigeons, raising pigs, watching over, tidying up, sweeping, etc., are all handled by leprosy patients with division of labor. Those with higher intelligence and skills also volunteer to be honorary teachers to help the general illiterate people in the hospital; some are good at writing and jointly run a magazine called "Morning Light Quarterly" with several comrades, which is the mouthpiece of the leprosy hospital; some advocate "labor service" and pave the flat road in the hospital with stone slabs; some individually knit textiles, which are disinfected by the hospital and sold to the outside world to make a living. They never reduce their courage to survive because of their physical disabilities. They also try to use the skills and intelligence that have not been stripped away by leprosy to help themselves and each other, full of friendly spirit, and build their own world.

In the early morning, a group of leprosy patients gather in the chapel to worship and read the scriptures. They do not forget to pursue spiritual strength and comfort to eliminate physical deficiencies and pain. They are also very particular about their food and lodging. Single spring bed, white sheets, thick mattresses. They eat three meals a day, early porridge with bran or red beans, lunch with one soup and two dishes, all using a separate meal system. Every Christmas, they slaughter the pigs they raise and eat as much as they can.

Yesterday, the underground market for cash boiled raw silk first fell sharply, and then suddenly rebounded in the afternoon, once retreating to the 24,000 yuan level. Initially, the news of control coming from the cotton yarn market caused infighting among many parties, but the Tianjin gang continued to be allowed to cover their shorts.

### Floating Profits Released, Government Bonds Suddenly Rebound, Drop Degree is Abnormal: E-Type is Still Larger than B-Type

The A and B types fell more, resulting in a special abnormal state, such as the B type being 1 yuan and 2 jiao smaller than the A type, while the E type was still 2 jiao larger than the B type. This kind of abnormal state is often found during major ups and downs, and it can also be seen that the general public is alarming each other, panicking for a while, and not thinking, resulting in this situation. The closing price of the C type was false and unreal. Yesterday, Xinji sold a large amount first, followed by Xie Kangyuan and Runde. Tongli and Tongkang both came out and entered first, and Tongshun's settlement was also extremely surging. Lianyi also sold out, mostly floating profits. Buyers included Tongyuan Lianhe Yongchang Chengkang Renchang Zhenhua Changji Runli Hengxing and other companies.

### The Standard Wife on the Silver Screen

— Tao Shunsheng

Thoughts on Mona Maris' Divorce

I remember in 1936, Hollywood star Mona Maris married playwright and producer Hob Rou Asser. At that time, he published an article about "Mrs." standard insight: "Men are absolutely weak to women, they cannot resist the offensive of the opposite sex, so wives inevitably encounter competition from the same sex. Pre-marital competition is preliminary, and post-marital competition is large-scale and long-term. Originally, love is selfish, but this selfishness should be a kind of understanding selfishness. Another synonym for marriage should be happiness. If sadness, depression, jealousy and other ingredients slowly erode the garden of marriage, this marriage is bound to fail."

Among Hollywood actresses, Mona Maris is known as the standard wife. Hollywood reporters tell us: In her private life, she is a typical wife, just like on the screen. But news came that Mona divorced Hob Rou in Reno on the first of this month. Presumably, there were sad and depressed ingredients in the garden of marriage.

However, Mona is brave after all. As soon as the first large-scale and long-term competition ended, she immediately began the second long-term competition. According to New York Telegraph: Mona married Harry Johnson, an assistant manager of a famous advertising company, on the fifth day after the divorce (the sixth of this month). I wonder if our standard wife on the screen has the preparation and determination to compete to the end when she opens the prelude to this long-term competition?

### The Chinese Dance Drama Society Performs "Five Planets" and "Indian Dance"

— Nong

"The first step for Chinese dance drama is to adopt dance postures from old Chinese operas, string them together with plots, and use music to assist the dance to convey the inner voice to the audience, appealing to both ear and eye. In reality, music is the most important, and dance is merely an aid to understanding the music. In Europe, this is called Ballet, which is one of the most elegant arts in the world, because it does not use words, so it is also one of the most international arts. If you want to promote a national art to the world, this is the most direct means. In the United States and the Soviet Union, dance drama occupies a very high position.

The "Dream Awakening at an Ancient Temple" performed by the Chinese Dance Drama Society last year was also an abstract folk tale. The society is a combination of several people who have a deep interest in the creation of Chinese dance drama and the promotion of Chinese music. Among them, the composer, Father Xia Lomo Fu, studied Chinese music more than twenty years ago, and previously composed symphonies such as "Beijing Hutong," which were performed in Peiping, Shanghai, New York, and other places, receiving extremely high praise. The "Five Planets" which is about to be performed, is a short dance drama that was finally released after overcoming various difficulties.

"Five Planets" is based on a Buddhist statue excavated from the Dunhuang cave (this Buddhist statue is a 5th-century artifact, now in the collection of the British Museum). In addition to the Maitreya Buddha in the center, the five planets, Venus, Jupiter, Mercury, Mars, and Saturn, stand around. The story is based on this book and developed with imagination: in Qingnong, these planets, although self-possessed, also play various games just like humans, and then return to their original positions. This is so simple that it cannot even be called a story, yet it contains many beautiful dance postures and melodious music.

New opera that does not completely follow the tunes of Peking opera but creates music based on Chinese folk songs, and musical theatre that combines parts of dialogue, singing, and dancing, will all be theatrical arts that the Chinese Dance Drama will attempt and establish after its trials are successful.

Chinese dance has not yet been discovered and promoted, and like music, after a period of revival and development, it will be one of the most magnificent and beautiful treasures in the world of art. Regarding this point, even today, it is generally recognized by many foreigners who understand Chinese art.

In addition to the one-act dance drama "Five Planets," there are also several individual small dances: "Horse Archery," "Swimming," "　　," "Fishing," and "Expedition," etc.

These sections are all performed by famous Kunqu opera actress Ma Liyun, amateur actor Chen Zhong, etc. Ma Liyun is a name we are more familiar with. "Last winter, she was still acting in the Gold Theater, and two or three years ago, she also performed the spoken drama "Thunderstorm" with Zhou Jiefang and others. She is a Peking opera actress with ambitions to improve Peking opera." Chen Zhong played Min Yong in "Dream Awakening at an Ancient Temple" last year, and his results were very good. There is also "Indian Dance", starring the famous Indian dance expert Indira Devi.

Chinese dance drama and Indian dance will be performed at the Lyceum Theatre from yesterday to tomorrow, every afternoon at 5:15.

### My Opinion on "Spring Water Love Waves"

— Zheng Binling

"Spring Water Love Waves" is a Venus production, the content narrates that a student, Tang Shusheng, who studied abroad, falls in love with Ah Mao, a female servant in his family who was used as collateral for debt, and one night, he cannot restrain himself and has a relationship with her. Later, Shusheng goes north to become an official, and Ah Mao and her mother cannot go with him due to their different identities. Shusheng, having ascended to officialdom, indulges in pleasure, first has an affair with the socialite Han Qiong, and then marries his cousin Hu Xiaoyu, while Ah Mao of the past is long forgotten. Since Ah Mao had a one-night stand, she had a son, but due to the environment, she could not survive, so she avoided entering a nursery. The person in charge of the nursery is founding a reclamation corps, and Ah Mao resolutely joins and travels far away with them. Passing by Shusheng's residence, they meet, but Shusheng denies her. Before long, Shusheng's affair with Han Qiong is discovered by his wife, so both women successively leave him. Shortly thereafter, Shusheng tracks down the reclamation corps, hoping to rekindle his dream with Ah Mao, but is rejected by Ah Mao.

Director Huang Han, this is his debut work, but his technique is sophisticated, and his organization is well-organized, not inferior to his predecessors. The only shortcoming is that the tense scenes are not tense enough. In terms of acting, Xu Feng's Shusheng, Hu Feng's Ah Mao, Wang Yexu's Tang father, Qin Wei's Liu Zihe, and Ouyang Shafei's Han Qiong are all quite suitable for their personalities, so their performances are natural, and the other actors also perform well. In terms of cinematography, there are several quite innovative shots. For example, the Tang father's hope that his son will become a high official and his marriage to his cousin are both shown in photographs, which can be said to be much better than verbal descriptions. On the whole, this film is still a successful work, but unfortunately the film is too short, and it only lasts for one hour and fifteen minutes, so the audience may not have enough fun.

### Riding the Storm Together

— He Jiaji

(5) Retaliation

Fei Changhe and his gang left with smug looks on their faces, and Qin Runzhi also suddenly thought of something and hurried out to chase after them. Ah Xing and He Ma and others were still whispering under the eaves. Wei Cheng glanced at them and asked, "Where is He Zixing?" Ah Xing said, "He went to pick up the Second Madam." Wei Cheng said, "Who told him to pick her up? Wouldn't it have been better to let the Second Madam stay at the Zhang's house for another day?" Ah Xing lowered his head and said nothing. Wei Cheng asked again whose idea it was. Ye Er Madam came in from outside, asking all the way, "Where is the person, where is the person?" This was almost a way to relieve Ah Xing. Wei Cheng greeted her from inside. Seeing that Ye Er Madam had her velvet rope short coat in her hand, and her hair was blown by the river wind, he concluded that she had not used pomade today: He Zixing followed behind, holding a large bundle of red sugarcane in his hand. Wei Cheng hurriedly called out: "Aunt, why did you come back?" Ye Er Madam said: "I heard that Fei Changhe brought a bunch of foxes and dogs to our house to extort money, and there is also Qin Runzhi acting as a smiling tiger. Where are they?" Wei Cheng smiled and said, "It's not as serious as Aunt said, He Zixing must have made a mountain out of a molehill. Aunt, they're gone." Ye Er Madam saw Magpie taking a broom and sweeping in the Shuangmei Study, so she walked into the Shuangmei Study. Wei Cheng said, "They really are gone. How is Yi Yi's health, is she completely healed? It's very good, she's been staying there quietly for a few days, but He Zixing insisted on inviting you back. Ye Er Madam said, "They're gone, they wouldn't leave if they didn't get any benefit, how much money did you give them?" Wei Cheng said, "Not much, Aunt knows, I'm afraid you'll be heartbroken." Ye Er Madam said, "Tell me. What is this on the table, like a land deed?" Wei Cheng said, "This is the contract that Fei Changhe made, and he won't come to borrow money again in the future." Ye Er Madam saw that it was three hundred dollars, and she clicked her tongue, complaining that Wei Cheng had no experience in dealing with the world, and that the money was spent meaninglessly. Wei Cheng blushed and thought, it was indeed a bit unfair to the elders, and his own wealth made Aunt unhappy. (101) (End of this section)
