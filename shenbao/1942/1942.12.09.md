### "Transfer Sincere Enthusiasm to Words and Deeds"

——Reflections on Reading Chief of Staff Kawabe's "Address to Japanese Soldiers in China" and Briefly Stating the Attitude of Our Country's Citizens——

On the anniversary of the Greater East Asia War, General Staff Kawabe Masakazu of the Japanese Expeditionary Force in China issued the "Address to Japanese Soldiers in China." After reading it repeatedly, in addition to expressing sincere admiration for Kawabe's "correct vision regarding the completion of the Greater East Asia War and the resolution of Sino-Japanese relations" and his spirit of treating the Chinese people with sincerity and encouraging Japanese soldiers, I feel that there are still many thoughts that must be stated from the standpoint of the Chinese people.

First, regarding the attitude of the Japanese soldiers in China, Kawabe emphasized (1) establishing strict military discipline; (2) practicing "sincerity"; and (3) respecting the traditional customs of the Chinese people. As for military discipline, the Japanese army has always been known to the world for its strictness. Moreover, the Japanese soldiers are all educated youths who, in peacetime, are law-abiding citizens or soldiers accustomed to military discipline through strict military training. Therefore, China has no reason to doubt the "strict military discipline." However, China's social environment is complex. Local bullies, gentry, and ignorant speculators will inevitably use various temptations and abuse their authority to do as they please, directly or indirectly affecting military discipline. This cannot but be taken with extra vigilance.

Secondly, speaking of "sincerity," the Japanese authorities have made repeated declarations over the past five years, and various parties in our country have responded with correct understanding. But as Kawabe said, "The Chongqing side remains obstinately unaware and continues to resist, because they are still seeking to trust Japan's sincerity." We must also add that the problem is not whether the Chongqing authorities trust Japan's sincerity, but whether the Chinese people have a correct understanding of Japan's sincerity. Chinese philosophy emphasizes the word "sincerity," and the Chinese people generally use the word "sincerity" to measure the friendly relationship between people, and even extend it to the relationship between people and gods, such as "sincerity brings efficacy," "sincerity can communicate with gods," and "where sincerity and determination penetrate, metal and stone will yield." These are the conclusions of Chinese life philosophy and folk philosophy over thousands of years. Historically, any ruler who treated the people with "sincerity" was loved by the people. Now the Japanese army is in China to "liberate China, free it from the oppression of Britain and the United States, help it achieve independence, and establish eternal good neighborly relations (see Kawabe's original text)." This has long been understood by a part of the Chinese intellectual class. However, the current problem is not the understanding and trust of a small number of Chinese government authorities and a part of the intellectuals, but the thorough understanding and trust of the common people, which can help the good neighborly relations between the two countries.

Again, Kawabe's special mention of "respecting the traditional customs of the Chinese people" is particularly insightful and important. The situation is often like this: the Chinese people sincerely trust the Japanese army's military discipline, and they also have a considerable understanding of the Japanese army's "sincerity." However, due to the differences between the traditional customs of the Chinese and Japanese people, the efforts of the aforementioned two are often negatively affected. Moreover, because of the gap between the two sides, the gap between the temperament of Japanese soldiers and the unique straightforward attitude of the Chinese people can often cause great misunderstandings due to small problems. On the one hand, it is necessary to step up the communication between the cultures of the two countries, not only to promote Japanese language and culture in China, but also for Japanese soldiers and civilians to study Chinese language, writing, history, social conditions, customs, and so on. On the other hand, it is also necessary to strengthen the psychology of "self-restraint" and the emotion of "mutual understanding," and to use "sincerity" to supplement strict military discipline. We must recognize that in this era of the Greater East Asia War, the areas where China and Japan need to cooperate must be very urgent, so both sides must immediately work to achieve this.

Secondly, Kawabe's words in "Sino-Japanese friendship begins with the expeditionary force" and "Always think of the battlefield in front and the hardships in the rear" are addressed to the Japanese soldiers, but the depth of the feelings of the Chinese people after reading them must not be less than those of the Japanese soldiers. There is no need to hide that, except for a very few outstanding figures, most Chinese people do not have academic research on politics, lack the ability to observe and have long-term vision, and they only rely on their intuition. They do not have a true understanding of the Japanese soldiers coming to China to fight, but they have a psychology passed down from generation to generation, that is, whoever comes and benefits them more, they will support and respect. Similarly, the Chinese people are not without the spirit of sacrifice, but there must be a kind of power or method to make them realize that this sacrifice is for their honor and benefit. The complicated factors of politics cannot be understood by them, and their political understanding is so simple, but this is what is worth noting and researching in the current work of strengthening Sino-Japanese cooperation.

After reading Kawabe's article, we dare to offer two further suggestions: first, a strict selection system must be adopted for Chinese staff or translators who assist the Japanese army. Especially: (1) Before being hired, they must go through a considerable period—at least six months or a year—to have a full and thorough understanding of Japan's true intentions toward China and the mission of the Japanese Expeditionary Force in China, and a full and practical understanding of the attitude, methods, and techniques of the work; (2) After being hired, various appropriate occasions and methods should still be used to continue training, so that they have higher attainments, and focus on the cultivation of character and the encouragement of integrity, so that they can make a good impression on the Chinese people; (3) A necessary system of assessment, rewards, and punishments must be established for his work, knowledge, ability, and especially his character and behavior, and this system must be more serious than the average. Only under this system and method can we avoid using people carelessly and harming the reputation of the Japanese army, and further increase the degree of Sino-Japanese cooperation because of being good at using people. Secondly, standing from the position of the Chinese people, we sincerely hope that the lower-ranking soldiers and related staff of the Japanese Expeditionary Force will be strengthened in political training, and often lectured on Chinese language, writing, history, customs, habits, and social organization, etc., so that they have a considerable understanding of all aspects. When contacting the Chinese people, they can avoid unnecessary misunderstandings, avoid fraud by interpreters and indirect contacts, and directly help Sino-Japanese cooperation and produce greater effects.

At the same time, because of Kawabe's article, we are more concerned about studying the attitude that the Chinese people should have toward the Japanese Expeditionary Force and friendly foreign nationals. First of all, we naturally need to have a more complete and thorough understanding and trust of Japan's policy toward China, the mission of the Japanese Expeditionary Force in China, and the mutual relations between the Chinese and Japanese people. This kind of understanding and trust must not be limited to slogans, slogans, speeches, and writing, but must be expressed in practical actions, just as we hope from the Japanese side. However, the education and organization of our country's ordinary people are not very perfect, so we hope that the authorities responsible for this aspect pay special attention to this. What is especially important is not the instillation-style and compulsory work, but the inspiration of the people's automatic requirements and the development of their initiative. Secondly, the people of our country should also have an attitude of neither being humble nor arrogant, like brothers, toward the soldiers of friendly countries and foreign nationals. Not being humble is the proper attitude of the East Asian nations who are rising up and becoming independent after the Greater East Asia War, and it is also the basis for the equal cooperation between the people of the two countries. Not being arrogant is a necessary condition for Sino-Japanese mutual understanding, mutual assistance, and mutual progress. Only by being neither humble nor arrogant can we be like brothers, cooperate, and strive for a bright future. Of course, it is not enough to just achieve this, so we should also treat each other with sincerity. Confucius said: "Do not do to others what you do not want done to yourself." This is what we expect from the Japanese side toward us, and we should do even more so to the Japanese side, especially in taking the lead in doing it, which is the manifestation of the word "sincerity." The foundation of the Chinese people's philosophy lies in the word "sincerity," and we must first set an example for others to see. And being sincere to Japan means using the spirit of sacrifice of sharing hardships today to seek common happiness in the future, that is, to be prepared for greater sacrifices, infinite sacrifices, to cooperate with Japan and jointly strive for the common victory of the two countries—that is, the victory of the Greater East Asia War—and the liberation of the East Asian nations.

Finally, we want to conclude with the "topic," "Transfer sincere enthusiasm to words and deeds." Both China and Japan should pay attention to avoiding any words or deeds that damage the feelings of the other party in the future, because a thousand articles of friendship and ten thousand slogans of cooperation are often greatly reduced in their effectiveness of friendship and cooperation by a hand or a foot that damages the feelings of the other party—this is what we sincerely expect from the efforts of both sides. Because sincerity, as Kawabe pointed out, is that "if the Sino-Japanese Incident cannot be completely resolved, then the Greater East Asia War will be difficult to achieve complete victory." And the complete resolution of the Sino-Japanese Incident lies in both forces "transferring sincere enthusiasm to words and deeds"!

### Greater East Asia War Anniversary: Japan Commemorates Solemnly Nationwide; Prime Minister Tojo Delivers Speech, Resolving to Strive for Final Victory

Tokyo, 8th (Central News Agency) The Greater East Asia War has reached its one-year anniversary. The resolution of Japan, both government and people, to complete the war and strive for final victory is becoming increasingly firm. On this anniversary, grand and solemn commemoration ceremonies are held throughout Japan. At 11:59 a.m. on the 8th, all transportation agencies and workers across the country stopped working for one minute to pray silently for the war dead and wish the soldiers on expedition a long and prosperous military career. Prime Minister Tojo solemnly read the declaration of war and rebroadcast the speech he gave last year when he paid homage to the declaration of war. Various agencies, groups, and schools also held ceremonies to read the declaration of war separately. At 2:00 p.m., a national assembly was convened across the country, with the central assembly held in front of the Yasukuni Shrine. Each unit in the prefectures and counties also held meetings separately and rebroadcast Prime Minister Tojo's speech at the central assembly. At 1:00 p.m., a grand military music concert was held at the Hibiya Public Hall in Tokyo, and at 6:00 p.m., a commemorative lecture meeting was held there, with lectures by Mayor Kishimoto of Tokyo, Section Chief Hirade of the Navy Press Department of the General Headquarters, and Director-General Tani of the Army Press Department of the General Headquarters. From dawn to dusk, crowds and representatives of groups flocked to the Nijubashi Bridge to pay respects to the Imperial Palace, praying for the Emperor's long life. The emotions were extremely enthusiastic.

Tokyo, 8th (Central News Agency) The National Assembly for the Anniversary of the Greater East Asia War, organized by the Great Japan Imperial Rule Assistance Association, etc., was convened separately in various parts of the country at 2:00 p.m. on the 8th. The central assembly in Tokyo was held at the Yasukuni Shrine. Prime Minister Tojo attended in person and delivered a speech, which was broadcast to various assemblies via radio. The gist of his speech is as follows: Fellow citizens, today last year was the day when we respectfully received the declaration of war against Britain and the United States. Recalling a year ago, the Empire, in order to maintain world peace and prevent human tragedy, showed the greatest restraint and self-respect, but finally rose up today a year ago. The one hundred million citizens of the Empire believed that the rise and fall of the Empire depended on this battle, and from that day on, with the belief that they would surely win, they vowed to devote all their strength to repay the country. On this day of profound significance, at the Yasukuni Shrine, where the spirits of those who have protected the country are enshrined, the National Assembly for the Anniversary of the Greater East Asia War is convened, and I would like to express my thoughts, which are truly filled with infinite emotion. Looking back at this year, all one hundred million of our compatriots have respectfully observed the imperial edict and devoted all their efforts to fighting bravely. At the beginning of the war, the Imperial Army severely damaged the main forces of the British and American fleets in Hawaii and Malaya respectively. At the same time, the army and navy, through skillful joint operations, successively captured Hong Kong, the Philippines, the Dutch East Indies, and Burma. Wherever the military went, the enemy was defeated and demoralized. The power of the Imperial Army has spread throughout the Greater East Asia region. Our people in the rear have also cooperated and overcome the hardships of wartime life, and each has devoted all their efforts to serving the public in their respective positions. The construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere has also been vigorously promoted at the same time as the progress of the war. Not to mention Hong Kong and Malaya, even Burma, the Dutch East Indies, and the Philippines have been freed from the shackles of Britain and the United States. The local residents are deeply grateful for the Emperor's grace and are happy to cooperate, so the construction project is progressing steadily and has achieved great results. In the past year, the Empire has established a solid foundation for victory in both strategic and economic terms, and has continued to expand and strengthen it. We will be able to fight again and win again until Britain and the United States surrender. Furthermore, the cooperation between Germany, Italy, and other European allies and the Empire has become closer since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War. As a result of fighting bravely in various aspects, they have also repeatedly achieved victories, and are responding to and advancing with the Empire in defeating the forces of Britain and the United States. At the same time, in the Greater East Asia region, Manchuria has devoted all its national strength to cooperating in the war, and the Nationalist Government of China is also cooperating with the Empire with the determination to share weal and woe in coping with the difficult situation. Thailand took appropriate measures at the beginning of the war, and later signed a defensive alliance with the Empire, exerting all its strength to cooperate in the war. Therefore, with the mutual support between the East and the West, and the unity of the various countries and nations in the Greater East Asia, the unprecedented war to defeat the common enemy, Britain and the United States, has entered a true stage. With the great achievements of the Empire in the past year, coupled with the concerted efforts of the allied nations, we are even more confident that we will be able to defeat the offensive of Britain and the United States. I still remember that before the war, the South Seas, which have countless important resources, were the treasure trove of Britain and the United States, but less than half a year after the outbreak of the war, they were liberated from oppression. These regions have now recovered their original appearance and have become the foundation of great war power to protect East Asia. The enemy has lost these abundant war resources, while East Asia has added countless treasures. But if we can make the greatest and best use of these resources to provide for the soldiers on the front lines to be active and successful, then it all depends on the shoulders of you, my fellow citizens. Therefore, the responsibility of our one hundred million citizens is by no means easy. Today's battlefield is no longer limited to the front lines, so it is no exaggeration to say that every move in your daily life will immediately affect the combat effectiveness of the front lines. Therefore, your factories are supply factories for the front lines to win victory, and your farms are the logistics departments for one hundred million citizens to win victory. In short, all of your duties, no matter how small, are battlefields for winning victory. There is also a saying that since ancient times, war has been a war of wills, so only those who can fight stubbornly to the last five minutes can win the glory of victory. Although the Empire has encountered many difficulties, the acquisition of resources in the South Seas is as described above. The weapon of economic blockade that the United States relied on to oppress us before the war has now been used by us. It is not difficult to know the extent of the difficulties faced by the enemy. Therefore, although we and the enemy are both fighting against the greatest difficulties today, the difference is that the enemy has fallen into the abyss of despair and is facing more and more difficulties, while we are growing out of the experience of pain with a bright future. As I have repeatedly stated in the past, this war is followed by a decisive battle after a huge consumption, so the first requirement for winning victory is to first win the current decisive battle. Moreover, we must win this war. If we cannot win, then the construction of the Greater East Asia, which the one billion people of East Asia have been looking forward to for a hundred years, will disappear completely like a beautiful dream. This cannot be answered to the spirits of the Yasukuni Shrine. Therefore, no matter what, we must overcome all difficulties, remove all obstacles, and break through the difficult situation in order to win the complete victory of this war. Now is not the time to issue empty arguments and make random criticisms. All the people of the country must devote all their intelligence, do their best, stick to their posts, and work hard. My personal will to devote myself to repaying the country has been decided. I will first serve the country for my fellow citizens and reassure the Emperor. Today is the anniversary of the war. I would like to express my gratitude to the allied nations for their great cooperation with the Empire, and I deeply hope that we will continue to cooperate closely, support each other, and achieve the common goal of striving for final victory.

### Capital Citizens' Asia Development Conference; Chairman Wang Attends in Person to Deliver Instructions; Cooperate in the Greater East Asia War; Realize Pan-Asianism

Nanjing, 8th (Central News Agency) Today (the 8th) is the anniversary of the Greater East Asia War. To express their enthusiastic celebration, the citizens of the capital hung flags throughout the city to mark the occasion and held the Capital Citizens' Asia Development Conference for the Anniversary of the Greater East Asia War at the National Assembly Hall at 9:30 a.m. The National Government attended in person to deliver instructions. At 9:30 a.m., the meeting was declared open to the sound of the national anthems of China and Japan, and the most respectful salutes were paid to the national flags of China and Japan. The audience respectfully listened to the Chairman's instructions, and all the citizens in the audience were extremely moved after hearing them. The ceremony ended at about 11:00 a.m.

Nanjing, 8th (Central News Agency) Yesterday (8th), Chairman Wang, for the anniversary of the Greater East Asia War, following up on the "Letter to the People of the Whole Country" issued on November 30 for the second anniversary of the Sino-Japanese Treaty, issued another "Letter to the People of the Whole Country," elaborating on the significance of cooperating in the Greater East Asia War and sharing weal and woe. In the morning, the Chairman attended the Capital Citizens' Asia Development Conference in person. First, he explained this meaning, and then made an important extension, pointing out that moving from the peace movement to cooperating in the Greater East Asia War is both progressive and consistent. The full text is as follows:

Moving from the peace movement to cooperating in the Greater East Asia War, this meaning is progressive, and it is consistent. The true meaning of the peace movement is to return to Sun Yat-sen's Pan-Asianism. Originally, Pan-Asianism was the backbone of the Chinese National Revolution. Although we had this ideal before, we did not get the opportunity to realize it. When the friendly nation of Japan advocated the construction of a new order in East Asia, based on the spirit of Eastern morality, in order to seek the coexistence and co-prosperity of China and Japan, then the opportunity to realize Pan-Asianism has arrived. Therefore, Chinese people of insight immediately abandoned the concept of resistance and engaged in the peace movement. This is not a change, but a return to the original face of the National Revolution. From then on, we recognized that reviving China and reviving East Asia are one thing, not two things. This kind of understanding, especially in the training of the general public, or in the training of the army, navy, and air force, should be a common and profound belief. Some people used to misunderstand peace, thinking that peace is to rest with the people. These misunderstandings are due to not knowing that in today's survival competition, only active progress, not passive retreat, can help. Some people also think that peace is to restore national vitality and cultivate the strength for the people to regenerate. This is only a one-sided view, because progress must have the correct direction and route. If we do not, we will not only be unable to benefit the country, but will also be enough to bring disaster. Today's survival competition is not just a competition between countries, but a competition between country groups. This kind of competition is a total war of the people. After having the spirit of active progress, we must use this spirit in a certain country group, with one mind and unwavering ambition. Only in this way can we win in the competition. Which country group should China stand on? China is a part of East Asia, and undoubtedly should stand on the East Asian country group. The direction and route were clearly indicated by the Father of the Nation in Pan-Asianism. Doing this is being an East Asian comrade, and not doing this is being an East Asian traitor. This meaning was determined at the beginning of the peace movement. Once the Greater East Asia War broke out, the National Government immediately declared that it would share weal and woe with the friendly nation of Japan. It is consistent in belief and progressive in action. Although China has been devastated for several years, the spirit of active progress is the foundation of everything. Engaging in organization, training, and even the creation of materials with this spirit, even if there are thousands of hardships and difficulties at present, once the Greater East Asia War is victorious, the day of East Asia's safety will also be the time of China's liberation. No matter how hard it is, it is worth it. This is a self-awareness that every Chinese person should have. There is another level, the so-called sharing weal and woe, we cannot only think about the gains and losses, especially we must think about what is right and wrong. China is a part of East Asia. If East Asia is to be destroyed by Britain and the United States, how can China survive alone? This is undeniable. For a hundred years, Britain and the United States have wanted to swallow East Asia in one gulp, but they have not been able to do what they wanted because Japan is there. This is also undeniable. Therefore, today, China and Japan are cooperating to seek the victory of the Greater East Asia War, which is truly at ease in China, without any hesitation or hesitation. Except for a few incorrigible traitors in Chongqing, the majority of the people, as long as they think of the Father of the Nation's Pan-Asianism, will definitely look back immediately. We only worry that we are not working hard enough, and we do not worry that overall peace will not be realized. Our pioneers of the peace movement, by setting an example, will surely enable our compatriots throughout the country to eventually move in the same direction and on the same route.

### Greater East Asia War Anniversary: Commemoration Meetings Held in Various Places; Central Committee Member Chen Bichen Delivers Speech in Guangzhou

Guangzhou, 8th (Central News Agency) Fourteen thousand Japanese residents here held a commemoration meeting at the Guangdong Shrine at 8:00 a.m. to commemorate the first anniversary of the Greater East Asia War. On the Chinese side, the Asia Development People's Congress was held at the Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall starting at 10:00 a.m. Representatives of various circles and students then paraded through the city. In the afternoon, a recreational gathering to comfort the Japanese army and street propaganda were also held. Guangzhou, 8th (Central News Agency) Central Committee Member Chen Bichen attended the Guangdong Asia Development Congress on the 8th and delivered a speech, which roughly said:

Today last year was the day when the Greater East Asia War began. You all already know clearly about the brilliant results of the Japanese army, navy, and air force, so there is no need for me to say it again. We are all people with brains, and seeing these results, we should understand that this is not a coincidence. Japan's brilliant results are the result of aspirations, preparations, and training over a period of time, and then there is today's achievement. At the same time, the defeats of Britain, the United States, and the Netherlands in the South Seas Islands, Pearl Harbor, and Manila were not defeated in an instant, but were accumulated over time.

The Greater East Asia War has been going on for a year now. China has not yet joined the war, but China has tried its best to fulfill its statement of sharing weal and woe. After years of devastation in China, material resources are so scarce that some of them must be supplied by the friendly nation of Japan. However, the material resources of China itself, except for the small portion that is barely enough for survival or not even enough for survival, should be supplied to the Greater East Asia War as much as possible.

Beijing, 8th (Central News Agency) 400,000 Japanese residents in various parts of North China took today as the anniversary of the Greater East Asia War, and prayed silently at noon, praying for the long-lasting military fortune of the wounded and soldiers on expedition, and thanking the military power of the spirits protecting the country. In addition, the people of China and Japan held a Greater East Asia War anniversary meeting at the Huai Ren Tang Hall, and issued a joint declaration to move towards the second year of the war with perseverance, solidarity, and the belief in victory. Tonight, the Sino-Japanese Baojia (community watch) groups convened a friendship meeting to discuss the issue of life reform and determined to practice the construction of North China.

### Ambassador of Manchukuo Expresses Sentiments: We Should Strive with One Heart and Advance Courageously; Achieving the Objectives of the War Is the Urgent Task

Central News Agency, Beijing Dispatch: Lü Ronghuan, the Ambassador of Manchukuo to China, made the following remarks on the occasion of the first anniversary of the Greater East Asia War: "Looking back on this day one year ago, the Japanese army launched a surprise attack on Pearl Harbor in Hawaii and advanced into the Malay Peninsula, Hong Kong, the Philippines, Borneo, and Burma, one after another. All of the important strategic strongholds of Britain and the United States were destroyed. Recently, fierce battles have been fought repeatedly in the southwestern Pacific, repelling the enemy's counter-offensive forces, and the only line of communication between Britain, the United States, and Australia has been severed. At present, the Japanese army, from the Aleutian Islands in the north to the Solomon Islands in the south, is securing a vast front line, as solid as a rock, and completely controls the sea power in the Pacific Ocean. On the mainland, it has inflicted heavy blows on Chongqing for five years, cutting off its supply lines. At the same time, our Manchukuo is responsible for defending the northern border and completing the mission of a major supply base, so that Japan has no worries about the rear. Together with the Republic of China, Vietnam, Thailand, and Burma, we form a solid formation. From this point of view, whether in the Pacific or on the mainland, Japan's strategic position has already gained an invincible position. In particular, Japan's great plan for the revival of East Asia has been gradually realized in the occupied territories in the south, and the various ethnic groups in the south are thoroughly awakened, helping each other and cooperating to build a bright and hopeful future for the Greater East Asia."

### Current Shortage of Supplies in Chongqing (Continued): Shortage of Supplies Promotes High Prices; Severity No Less Than Currency Inflation

Today, the issue of domestic prices is closely related to fiscal finance. However, the factor of insufficient supplies should not be ignored. The domestic wartime price surge began in late March 1940 with the soaring price of yarn. The reason for the soaring price of yarn was due to the shortage of goods. In mid-February 1940, there was not much yarn in stock in the Chongqing market. At the same time, due to transportation obstacles, it was difficult to receive goods, and merchants took the opportunity to hoard, gradually creating a situation where the supply of yarn could not meet the demand. After late March, yarn was extremely scarce, and the price of yarn skyrocketed. For example, the price of 20-count Double Horse brand cotton yarn rose by about 1,000 yuan in one week, and about doubled in one month from February to March. This was the beginning of the serious price problem.

For example, in the autumn of 1940, the rice harvest was poor, and rice from Hunan and Jiangxi could not meet the needs of Sichuan Province due to transportation difficulties. Large grain merchants saw this situation and refused to sell, while some merchants took the opportunity to purchase and hoard for profit, resulting in a severe grain shortage. The price rose threefold from August to December, and a total of seven and a half times by July of the following year. From this, it can be seen that the factor of insufficient supplies has a sudden and rapid effect on prices, which is most likely to shake people's hearts.

If we carefully observe the origin and process of the serious price problem in Chongqing in recent years, the above two examples are the most significant events. Now, let's estimate the supply and demand situation of daily necessities such as cotton yarn in order to get a glimpse of the degree of insufficient supplies.

According to the estimates of Nie Guangyu and Zhu Xianfang, the average annual consumption of cloth per person is 6 yards of coarse cloth, 3 yards of medium cloth, and 1 yard of fine cloth, totaling 10 yards. Usually, each bolt of cloth has about 40 yards. According to the pre-war annual output of power-loom woven and hand-loom woven cloth, the total is 95 million bolts, plus a cloth trade surplus of 500,000 bolts, totaling 95.5 million bolts, which is the total supply, that is, the amount needed. If the total population of the country is 400 million, then the amount of cloth needed per person per year is about one-quarter of a bolt, that is, 10 yards, which is consistent with the estimates of Nie and Zhu. Now, each bale of yarn of 24 counts or less can produce 30 bolts of coarse cloth; each bale of yarn of 32-42 counts can produce about 10 bolts of medium cloth; each bale of yarn of 60-80 counts can produce about 8 bolts of fine cloth. According to this standard, the amount of yarn needed can be obtained from the amount of cloth needed. Each bale of Chinese yarn weighs 420 pounds, or 381.024 catties, and the consumption of cotton spinning is very small, so the spinning of each bale of yarn requires 3.8 catties of cotton, so the amount of cotton needed can be deduced from the amount of yarn needed.

According to population estimates, taking the twelve provinces of Sichuan, Kang, Yunnan, Guizhou, Guangxi, Hunan, Henan, Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, Qinghai, and Xinjiang as the standard, then:

(1) Supply of Cloth: According to estimates, there are currently about 4,000 power looms in the interior, and the maximum annual production capacity can reach 2 million bolts. Due to air raids, bombing, or lack of power, only about 1,468,000 bolts were actually produced in the previous few years, plus about 9 million bolts actually produced by hand looms, totaling 10,146,800 bolts. However, according to the estimate of a certain organization, after the relocated factories supplemented equipment and added small weaving machines, it is said that the annual power loom production can reach about 285,449 bolts per month, and about 3,425,388 bolts per year. If 9 million bolts of hand-loom woven cloth are added, the total annual production of power and hand-loom woven cloth in the rear area can reach about 12,425,388 bolts. The above estimates are all similar.

(2) Supply of Yarn: In 1940, 108,000 power yarn spindles were put into operation in the interior, producing 68,632 bales of yarn. In addition, there were 36,000 "July 7th" and "January 28th" spinning machines, and 525,000 hand-spinning spindles, producing 440,000 bales of yarn, totaling about 508,000 bales. According to a report from a certain organization, as of the end of last year, the number of power yarn spindles had increased to 131,700, with a monthly output of 9,142 bales and an annual output of 110,704 bales. If 440,000 bales of hand-spun yarn are added, a total of 550,700 bales can be produced. However, according to another estimate, power spinning machines can produce about 70,000 bales per year, and hand-spinning can produce about 300,000 bales per year, totaling about 370,000 bales. This number is slightly different from the above estimate. Now, assuming that the former estimate is the highest output and the latter estimate is the lowest output, it seems reasonable.

(3) Supply of Cotton: According to the estimate of the Chongqing Agricultural Bureau, the cotton production in the interior is 1.2 million dan in the Shaanxi-Henan area, 300,000 dan in the Xiangfan area, 400,000 dan in the Dongting Lake area, 400,000 dan in the Zhejiang East area, and 500,000 dan in the Sichuan Central area, totaling 2.8 million dan. This is also quite similar to the estimate of the Central Agricultural Experiment Station.

The amount of supply and demand of cotton yarn and cloth has been estimated as above. Let's list and compare the estimated figures as follows:

According to the estimate of the Secretariat of the Chongqing Ministry of Economic Affairs, the interior population is 200 million, requiring 50 million bolts of cloth and 5 million bolts of military cloth, equivalent to 1.6 million bales of yarn and 6.1 million piculs of cotton. This is similar to the above estimate.

The estimated amount of demand for cotton yarn and cloth is as above. The estimated amount of supply is as follows: If we compare the lowest amount of demand with the highest amount of supply, the difference is 12,575,000 bolts for cloth, 150,000 bales for yarn, and 200,000 piculs for cotton.

As can be seen from the above table, the supply of yarn, cloth, and cotton is less than the lowest amount of demand, and their prices rose by more than two times in 1940 and about one and a half times in 1941. However, cotton yarn and cloth are not among the most insufficient supplies, so the severity of the shortage of supplies on price increases is no less than currency inflation. Moreover, at present, foreign supplies cannot be imported, and even if they are imported by plane, the quantity is extremely small, and the prospects are truly worrying.

### Sugar Merchants' Cooperative Business Office: Supplies More Sugar for Sale; Purchase Limit with Housing Donation Tickets Expected to Be Relaxed

The supply problems of edible oil and sugar in Shanghai will be improved so that citizens, who have been anxiously awaiting the long-awaited shortage of edible oil, can hopefully be sold properly distributed soon. The reporter of the Datong News Agency recorded it as follows:

Business and Industrial Trends

### The Pioneer of Shanghai's Business Community: New Asia Construction Industry Co., Ltd. (Continued)

Now, let's briefly introduce the New Asia factories that New Asia Construction Industry Co., Ltd. is currently investing in: (1) New Asia Chemical Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., abbreviated as New Asia Pharmaceutical Factory, was founded in 1926 by accountant Mr. Xu Guanqun and pharmacist Zhao Rutiao. Initially, the scale was small, starting with the manufacturing of cosmetics and proprietary medicines. However, due to effective management, after more than ten years, the scope expanded, and business increased daily. Now, it holds the leading position among Chinese pharmaceutical factories. Offices are located throughout China and Southeast Asia, and branch factories are located in North and West China. Its main affiliated businesses include New Asia Glass Factory, New Asia Chemical Pharmaceutical Research Institute, New Asia Biological Research Institute, Guangcheng Pharmaceutical College, Guanqun Amateur Tutoring School, New Asia Library, and New Asia publications, such as English Medical Magazine, New Medicine Journal, National Medicine News, and Healthy Family. (2) New Asia Sanitary Material Factory Co., Ltd. specializes in manufacturing New Asia plasters, which are widely sold at home and abroad. Founded in 1937, by 1941, the business reached more than 1.3 million yuan, exceeding the original capital by four times, and the capital was increased to 1.2 million national currency to increase production and replenish raw materials. (3) New Asia Serum Factory Co., Ltd., was founded in 1938, with an initial capital of 300,000 national currency. It is said that it will soon increase its capital to 2 million yuan. In terms of manufacturing, it is divided into a preventive manufacturing department, a therapeutic product department, and a serum department. (4) New Asia Enzyme Industry Co., Ltd., was founded in 1941, with an authorized share capital of 1 million national currency. In 1942, the capital was increased to 3 million national currency to expand production. The currently produced yeast has been sold throughout the city to meet the fermentation needs of household flour. (5) New Asia Science Co., Ltd., was founded in 1941, with a capital of 1 million national currency. Products include various printed materials, various cardboard boxes, educational supplies, stationery, and instruments. (6) Hong Kong New Asia Chemical Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., abbreviated as Hong Kong New Asia Pharmaceutical Factory, was established in 1939 by Shanghai New Asia Pharmaceutical Factory in conjunction with overseas Chinese in Hong Kong. The initial capital was 500,000 Hong Kong dollars. A factory building was built in Kowloon, and medicines were made using raw materials produced in the tropics and sold throughout Southeast Asia.

The New Asia factories mentioned above are the targets that New Asia Construction Industry Co., Ltd. is currently investing in. As for future investment targets, generally speaking, it is to promote new-style industrial and commercial enterprises, and to cope with the new environment and new problems encountered by today's industrial and commercial circles, it is necessary to put materials, methods, spiritual strength, and overall strength together to develop general and socially needed businesses, whether industrial or commercial. In short, the ideal is to alleviate the current difficulties of private enterprises and plan for the post-war construction of private enterprises—and to move from the ideal to the realization—as an object.

Three. New Asia Construction Industry in Organization and Talent:

The organization of New Asia Construction Industry Co., Ltd. can be said to be simplified. In addition to its shareholders' meeting, board of directors, and supervisors, its internal structure absolutely adopts the principle of valuing quality over quantity. It absolutely does not follow the habit of setting up positions according to precedents or individuals. Therefore, the company is headed by the chairman of the board serving concurrently as general manager, and there are no titles such as deputy general manager, manager, assistant manager, deputy manager, or assistant manager under the general manager. There are only four departments: business, general affairs, auditing, and design. Each department is divided into sections; the business department manages sales, service, storage, and statistics; the general affairs department manages documentation, general affairs, personnel, and share affairs; the auditing department manages auditing, accounting, and cashier; the design department manages design, research, and writing. In addition, there is a consultant specialist office on the left and right of the general manager, specially for consultation.

On the day of the opening, a guest said this: "Although the capital of New Asia Construction Industry is nominally 10 million yuan, I am afraid that the talent of New Asia Construction Industry cannot be recruited with this 10 million yuan." In other words, its internal talent can be said to be all-inclusive. Such as Chairman Xu Guanqun, Managing Directors Zhu Boquan, Qiu Liangrong, Directors Zhao Rutiao, Gu Kemin, Hui Guangfang, Chuan Xiangcheng, Zhu Rutang, Xu Xie Kang, Wu Yunzhai, Ye Fuxiao, Xu Baohua, Shi Zuomou, Supervisors Li Bohan, Xu Jingzhi, Shi Quan, Cheng Mu, Cao Yuyu, are all leading figures in Shanghai's industrial and commercial circles, the business community, and the financial community; such as Zhang Guohua, director of the General Affairs Department, Yu Daosun, director of the Auditing Department, Li Tisheng, director of the Business Department, and Liu Yunfang, director of the Design Department, are all experienced specialists. It can be said that talents are gathered together.

Based on the above description, we can probably get a bird's-eye view of the newly opened New Asia Construction Industry Co., Ltd. We, who are in today's industrial and commercial environment, naturally hold infinite expectations and surge with full enthusiasm for this investment organization with principles, strength, organization, and talent.

### French Concession: Air Raid Drill Results

The French Concession Passive Defense Committee's October report states that during this month, a total of 18 air raid drills (including alarms, bombing, firefighting) were conducted within the French Concession. During the drills, the district police, cleaning squads, rescue teams, and first aid teams were all able to do their best. The speed with which they rushed to the scene of the incident after hearing the alarm was particularly gratifying. Each time, the president of the fire brigade also taught techniques such as climbing ladders and passing water buckets. The health department also sent specialists to the scene to teach basic first aid and methods of transporting the injured on stretchers. During the blackout drills, it was initially discovered that many residents lifted the curtains and turned off the lights. To prevent this phenomenon and to keep residents informed of the alarm at any time, the concession was divided into several small areas (Xiaodongmen divided into two areas, Mailan three areas, Xuhui six areas, Central six areas, Foch four areas, Beidang six areas), and each small area conducted a drill once a week. In November, a total of 118 blackout drills were conducted, with satisfactory results. All of the above drills will continue to be held in December.

### The Greater East Asia War in the Past Year (2)

— Chen Binhe

(7) The Battle of the Philippines

On December 8th, Japanese army and navy air units launched a sudden attack on the American air force and major airfields in the Philippines, inflicting a fatal blow on the air power that the United States was preparing to use to attack the Japanese mainland. Before dawn on the 10th, they began landing troops ahead of the enemy on the northern shore of Luzon Island near Aparri and on the northwestern coast. The Japanese flag was raised on American territory in the Far East, which the Japanese called a "bloodless landing." On the 12th, Japanese troops also landed near Legazpi at the southeastern tip of Luzon Island. On the morning of the 20th, they occupied Mindanao Island, which is the second largest island in the Philippines after Luzon. From then on, the Philippine defense line was broken through.

On the 22nd, the main Japanese force landed at Lingayen on the west coast of Luzon Island, 200 kilometers north of Manila. From the 24th to the 27th, other areas were successively landed upon, encircling and attacking Manila. By New Year's Day of this year, Japanese troops had completely occupied Manila, the capital of the Philippine Islands. By early May, Japanese troops had taken complete control of the Philippines.

(8) The Battle of Borneo

During the first week of the Greater East Asia War, the three major Anglo-American military strongholds of Hawaii, Singapore, and Manila were attacked, destroying their naval and air power. In the second week, the center of the war shifted to the South China Sea—the main battlefield for Japan's war against Britain and the United States. Originally, Hong Kong to the north, the Philippine Islands to the east, the Malay Peninsula to the west, and British Borneo to the south, with Hong Kong, Manila, and Singapore forming the strategic triangle of the Far East for Britain and the United States, were the main bases for attacking Japan. On the first day of the war, Japanese troops first attacked Hong Kong, and on the third to fifth days, they landed on the northern and southern ends of Luzon Island in the Philippines. Then Vietnam and Thailand signed military agreements and alliances with Japan on the 11th, so the Anglo-American encirclement of Japan in the South China Sea had been broken through in various places. The only remaining base was Borneo. Borneo is the second largest island in the world, with the British-owned portion accounting for two-sevenths of the entire island, and the northern coast being an oil-producing area. Japanese troops landed on Borneo on December 16th, echoing Hong Kong, Malaya, and the Philippines, and controlled the entire South China Sea.

Japanese troops landed in Miri, Labuan, and Seria in Borneo. After a month of bloody fighting, by February 4th, British Borneo was completely pacified. From then on, the South China Sea, from Hong Kong in the north to Borneo in the south, and the Philippines in the east, were all occupied by Japanese troops; thus, the overall offensive against Malaya, especially Singapore, could be strengthened.

(9) The Fall of Singapore

Under the command of General Yamashita, the elite Japanese troops began landing on the Malay Peninsula on December 8th, occupying the Taiping airfield. On the 17th, Penang was occupied. On January 3rd, they captured Kota Bharu, an important air base 280 kilometers north of Singapore, making Singapore a target for Japanese fighter planes.

After the main force in the capture of Penang won, it continued to attack Perak. On the 23rd, they occupied Taiping, the world's top tin-producing area. On the 23rd, they crossed the Perak River, and on the 28th, they attacked Ipoh, the capital of Perak, securing an air base that directly threatened Singapore. On January 16th of this year, they penetrated into Kluang in central Johor. Then, on January 31st, Johor Bahru was captured. In the 55 days from December 8th to this point, Japanese troops advanced 1,100 kilometers, setting an unprecedented example of speed in the history of war.

Thus, the battle to capture the Singapore fortress began.

Singapore, this military base of the British Empire for invading East Asia, was built with a national defense expenditure of 400 million yuan, a long period of time, and painstaking construction, and was known as one of the two major fortresses in the world along with Gibraltar at the western mouth of the Mediterranean. But it finally suffered a ruthless attack by the Japanese army. On January 31st, Japanese troops began to forcibly cross the Johor Strait. On the night of February 7th, they landed on Pulau Ubin northeast of Singapore to contain the enemy. On the night of February 8th, they launched a general attack on Singapore, and at 7:00 PM on the 9th, they occupied Tengah Airfield. On the 11th, they seized Bukit Timah, and the Singapore city streets were within easy reach. On the morning of the 14th, they began operations in the Singapore city streets; on the afternoon of the 15th, they finally occupied Singapore, leaving a stunning page in the history of the Greater East Asia War.

The occupation of Singapore has significant implications for determining the fate of East Asia. From a military point of view, first, the Anglo-American encirclement of Japan in the South China Sea was completely eliminated, and the British and Americans could no longer carry out a joint defense line in the Southwest Pacific. Second, from then on, the Japanese army not only became the master of the South China Sea, but also had to go on to resolve the fate of the Dutch East Indies, allied with the British and Americans. Third, after the Japanese army occupied Malaya and Singapore, it could go on to control the Indian Ocean and unfold a more ambitious future for the Japanese army.

From a political point of view, Singapore was the headquarters of the Anglo-American alliance against Japan. Japan's occupation of Singapore not only aroused doubts among the British and American people about the Anglo-American war effort in the Pacific, but also gave the Dutch East Indies a great blow in advance, and the morale of the Dutch East Indies was greatly frustrated as a result. In addition, the small countries of East Asia and the small ethnic groups who had been oppressed by Anglo-American and Dutch imperialists for more than a hundred years suddenly strengthened their confidence in the Asian nation, changing their worship or fear of the British and Americans in the past. This is of great significance in the awakening of the Greater East Asian nation.

(10) The Battle of the East Indies

The Dutch East Indies was where the life of Dutch imperialists lay, and on the eve of the Greater East Asia War, it was a major link in the ABCD line. Therefore, when the Japanese army captured Singapore, it immediately launched a general offensive against the Dutch East Indies.

First, on January 11th, Japanese troops landed in Tarakan on the east coast of Dutch Borneo, and on the 24th, they attacked Balikpapan, an important location on the east coast of Borneo, and completely occupied the city on the 25th. This is an important location in the South Pacific. After the occupation, Japanese troops could control the Makassar Strait, which was tantamount to inserting a sharp dagger into Surabaya, the heart of the Dutch East Indies. In January, on the 17th, they went on to pacify western Borneo, and by mid-March, Dutch Borneo had been completely occupied.

Secondly, on January 26th, Japanese troops occupied Sebatik Island in the Celebes Islands, controlling the Makassar Strait, forming a major threat to the Dutch East Indies and Australia. The offensive against southern Sumatra began on February 6th. On the 11th, they first defeated the enemy's air force. In less than ten days, Japanese troops had pacified the main areas of southern Sumatra, and Java was completely under the threat of the Japanese army.

After that, after the naval battle of Java, the Japanese navy and air force again achieved unprecedented victory. When Singapore fell, Dutch Java was isolated. On March 1st, Japanese army units forcibly landed in eastern, central, and western Java under the cover of the navy, immediately achieving great success, and the Southwest Pacific Allied Command was virtually dissolved. By March 5th, the Japanese flag was flying over Batavia, the capital of the Dutch East Indies. The war moved to the eastern front, and on March 8th, the Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies and the commander of the Allied forces bowed their heads and surrendered to the Japanese army.

From then on, the Anglo-American-Dutch counter-offensive base in the Southwest Pacific was completely destroyed. On the western front, Japanese troops were already facing the Indian Ocean, and on the eastern front, they had isolated Australia.

(11) The Battle of Burma

When the Japanese army was galloping across the Southwest Pacific and was invincible, the United Nations, in the midst of defeat, attempted to contain the Japanese army from another direction. The main thing here was to first strengthen aid to Chongqing and launch counter-offensives on the central, southern, and northern China fronts. Second, to realize Anglo-American-Chongqing military cooperation, strengthen the defense of Burma, and then advance into Vietnam and Thailand in an attempt to disperse Japanese forces. In these two strategies, Burma had very important strategic and tactical significance and could pose a major threat to Japan. Thus, Japan began the campaign to capture Burma.

First of all, in terms of air power, Japanese troops launched a major air raid on Burmese air bases as early as December 13th. After that, the Japanese air force continued to operate in various parts of Burma, with the main purpose of crushing the Anglo-American air force built in Burma.

When the Japanese army attacked the Malay Peninsula, the Japanese army had already occupied important positions near Tavoy, which belonged to Burma, a key point in the Kra Isthmus, on January 17th, in order to block reinforcements from Burma to Malaya. On January 20th, the Japanese air force heavily bombed Moulmein, the third largest city in Burma, to assist the army in attacking the Moulmein Plain. On January 31st, the city of Moulmein was occupied. Thus, all enemy forces east of Burma were cleared by the Japanese, and the aid route to Chongqing was completely within the Japanese bombing range; at the same time, Rangoon, the capital of Burma, was also isolated.

On February 10th, Japanese troops began to advance towards Rangoon, and on March 3rd, they launched a general attack on Rangoon, completely occupying it on the 8th.

After the fall of Rangoon, the British army quickly requested Chongqing to send troops to rescue them, and the Chiang army quickly advanced into Burma. However, before the camp was established, there was a large-scale retreat of British troops, followed by an unexpected flanking maneuver by the Japanese army. On April 29th, the Japanese army suddenly occupied Lashio, and on May 1st, they occupied Mandalay, the second largest city in Burma. Then, on May 3rd, they attacked Bhamo, and the Chiang army was surrounded and divided, even without a way out. On May 5th, the Japanese army rushed into the gate of Yunnan. From then on, Burma was no longer a barrier to India, and the Japanese army had surged to the edge of India, and the fate of the collapse of the British Empire in Asia was imminent. From then on, the Indians also stood up and demanded to decide their own destiny. (To be continued)
