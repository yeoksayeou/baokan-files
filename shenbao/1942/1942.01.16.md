### The War in Malaya Continues to Move South: Crossing the Malacca Border, Japanese Forces Announce Entry into Gemas, British Forces to Defend the Benar Line

Tokyo, 15th (Domei News Agency) - The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 4:00 PM today that Japanese land and air forces, pursuing enemy forces on the west coast of Malaya, crossed the Malacca border last night and entered Gemas, an important railway junction leading to Singapore.

Tokyo, 15th (Domei News Agency) - Regarding military operations in Malaya, as of yesterday, the Imperial Headquarters announced this afternoon that a Japanese column on the west coast entered Gemas last night. This location is a crucial railway intersection for reaching Singapore. Simultaneously, the right flank reached the vicinity of Bekok, approximately 120 miles north of Singapore. The main force of the Japanese army continues to advance towards the coastal area of Kuala Selangor. Another column has landed south of Klang, at Morib.

Malaya Front, 15th (Domei News Agency) - The vanguard of the Japanese army, taking advantage of their victory, moved south and entered Johor territory yesterday. Johor Bahru is the southernmost point of the Malay Peninsula, defended by approximately 30,000 British troops along a 150-kilometer line.

Tokyo, 15th (Haitong News Agency) - According to semi-official reports yesterday, the advancing Japanese forces reported that British resistance between the Pahang River and the Johor border has collapsed. As such, the Japanese forces in the east are now able to enter the state of Johor. Yesterday afternoon, Japanese reconnaissance aircraft also spotted retreating British forces in the west crossing into the Johor border. The number of British ships sunk in the Strait of Malacca has increased to seven.

Batavia, 15th (Reuters) - It has been learned today that General Pownall, Chief of Staff to General Wavell, inspected the Netherlands East Indies Air Force at an airfield in Malaya, where he was received by Colonel Van Gleenke, Commander of the Netherlands East Indies Air Force.

British Authorities Insist They Will Defend Singapore to the Death

London, 15th (Reuters) - News of the British forces in Malaya continuing to retreat towards Singapore has led many in London to believe that the battle for Singapore is becoming increasingly imminent. Tokyo anticipates the fall of Singapore within two days. However, British authorities insisted today that they will defend Singapore to the death, regardless of the cost. A major concern is that most of the airfields in the Malay Peninsula have been captured by the Japanese, making it more difficult to provide air cover for the defending forces from all the airfields on Singapore Island. The operational range of British fighters has been limited. Once the Japanese approach, all airfields in Singapore will become primary targets. The authorities must have taken precautionary measures for this situation. As for the actual results of the fighting in Malaya, it is difficult to draw conclusions due to the lack of detailed official announcements. The shift in the strategic situation is evident: the main force of the British army has retreated past Johor State and is heading straight for Singapore. The fighting near Seremban, northwest of Kuala Lumpur, is merely delaying the Japanese advance southward. Singapore Island is separated from Johor State by only a strait, about three-quarters of a mile wide, which can prevent Japanese tanks from passing.

Tokyo, 15th (Reuters) - The Yomiuri Shimbun today carried a report from Singapore stating that after the fall of Kuala Lumpur, British authorities have intensified the strengthening of the "Pownall Line" (General Pownall is General Wavell's Chief of Staff). The Yomiuri Shimbun also stated that the line forms a semicircle of interconnected fortresses, starting from an area south of Malacca, running across the southernmost part of the Malay Peninsula, to the east coast, about 125 miles long, to protect Singapore. It is reported that British troops north of the "Pownall Line" are currently retreating into the new defense line, while reinforcements are being sent from Singapore to strengthen the "Pownall Line."

Malayan Air Force Equipment: Australian Troops Express Disappointment

Sydney, 15th (Reuters) - A group of wounded soldiers returned to Australia from Malaya. According to their unanimous opinion, "Our only hope in Malaya lies in the air force immediately achieving parity with the Japanese. If this is not addressed promptly, we will repeat the Crete disaster. When we were initially deployed to Malaya, we were told that the facilities were complete and impregnable. Who knew that twelve months later, when the Japanese attacked, the place would be almost empty? The Japanese have almost complete freedom in the air."

London, 15th (Reuters) - General Wavell, in his capacity as Commander of the Allied Forces in the Southwest Pacific, has arrived in the Netherlands East Indies and established his headquarters there. He must now respond to the threat to Singapore. Tokyo claims that Japanese forces have reached Tampin (on the Malacca border, 120 miles from Singapore Island), while other Japanese forces have entered Seremban (40 miles northwest of Malacca, 150 miles from Singapore) and the coastal town of Semban. The British official communiqué from Singapore did not mention the fighting in these areas. However, according to responsible sources in London, British forces are continuing to retreat, but the location of their front lines has not been specified. As the Japanese army advances in Malaya, their air force bases are getting closer, and the attacks on Singapore are becoming more intense. In one raid yesterday, there were a total of 70 Japanese bombers and fighters. However, officials said that the damage on the ground was minor. The Japanese aircraft flew very high and were intercepted by British fighters. Tokyo announced that the army and navy aircraft launched a major attack on Singapore.

### Government Sets Deadline to Redeem Hong Kong Dollars: Protecting the Interests of Overseas Chinese in Hong Kong; Stipulates Exchange Rate for National Currency

Chongqing, 15th - Since the outbreak of the Pacific War, many overseas Chinese from Hong Kong have brought Hong Kong banknotes inland. After the fall of Hong Kong, the market price of Hong Kong dollars plummeted, greatly affecting the interests of the relocated overseas Chinese. In order to protect the interests of overseas Chinese, the Ministry of Finance, after consultation with the British government, has decided to set a deadline for phased redemption. The Ministry of Finance has designated the Central Bank of China, the Bank of China, the Communications Bank, and the Farmers Bank, the Postal Savings and Remittances Bureau, and the provincial banks of Guangdong, Guangxi, and Fujian to redeem Hong Kong dollars at a rate of 4.65 national currency units per Hong Kong dollar. The Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation will transfer funds to the British side in exchange for pounds sterling to compensate. Firstly, the import of Hong Kong dollars from foreign countries and occupied areas into free China will be prohibited. Once discovered, they will be confiscated and reported to the Ministry of Finance for verification in order to prevent opportunistic behavior. The redemption period for the eight bank bureaus is limited to January 31 of this year, and no further redemptions will be made after the deadline. The amount allowed to be redeemed per person per month is limited to 500 Hong Kong dollars. Those holding amounts exceeding this limit will have their redemptions deferred. This matter is similar in intent to collecting remittances from overseas Chinese, and it provides many conveniences for overseas Chinese holding Hong Kong dollars.

Special Article by Our Newspaper
A Short History of the German Paratroopers (4)

Eight days later, the first exercise was held. Göring, Udet, and the other air force generals present witnessed the brave Third Battalion blooming in the air. By this time, relocation, accommodation, organization, equipment, training, and preliminary tactics had all been completed. The progress and number of paratroop units remained somewhat secret for the next three years. It was not until Hitler's fiftieth birthday in the spring of 1939 that they were publicly displayed. During the grand parade, hundreds of soldiers in special uniforms jumped from a fleet of planes, shooting with pistols and yelling like Native Americans, but as soon as they landed, they quickly formed machine gun "islands" like the Eight Trigrams Formation, which was dizzying to watch. At that time, consultants, diplomats, and unofficial experts from various countries were all present to observe.

To the Germans' surprise, the crowd witnessing the performance became euphoric after the initial excitement. However, the impact on foreign consultants was completely different. This was not like the "leap of five thousand people" in the 1932 Soviet military exercise, which was just a chance performance! Sharp-eyed people could already see that a new and terrifying kind of war might become a reality. It is said that at the time, an ambassador from a certain country was deeply afraid that after the consultant's report was submitted to his government, it would be mocked by the authorities.

While General Udet and his colleagues were diligently developing the technical aspects of the paratroop units, the General Staff was also studying a bigger problem: how to integrate this new force into their overall war plan. The result of the study was what German officers called the "aircraft tank" offensive, which is known to the world as "Blitzkrieg." Broadly speaking, this concept allocates traditional weapons as follows: cannons are mounted on airplanes and vehicles, cavalry becomes motorcycle units, part of the infantry is used in the air, and most are put into transport vehicles, responsible for clearing and patrolling in the second stage of operations. Paying attention to the Soviet front-line war reports will clearly show these points.

### Pan-American Conference Opens; Brazilian President Delivers Welcome Speech; Chilean Foreign Minister Delivers Reply on Behalf of Delegates

First Session Scheduled for This Afternoon

Capital of Brazil, 15th (Havas) - The conference of American countries is scheduled to hold a grand opening ceremony at the Ministry of Information building at 5:30 PM today. At that time, Brazilian President Vargas will preside over the meeting and deliver a welcome speech to the delegates of each country. Then, Chilean Foreign Minister Rossetti will deliver a reply on behalf of all 20 American countries. The chief delegates of each country are scheduled to hold a closed-door meeting at the Brazilian Ministry of Foreign Affairs this morning in order to draft the agenda, so that they can immediately discuss the proposals when the first session of the conference is held at 11:00 AM tomorrow morning. There will be as many as 220 attending delegates and experts, who can be divided into four categories according to their opinions:
*   The United States and Latin American countries that have declared war on the Axis countries.
*   Countries that have severed relations with the Axis countries but have not declared war.
*   Countries that sympathize with the United States but whose attitudes are still uncertain.
*   Countries such as Argentina. These countries recognize the non-belligerent rights enjoyed by the United States and other American participating countries, but do not intend to cooperate further in military actions in North America.

Tokyo Closely Watching

Tokyo, 15th (Haitong News Agency) - People in Tokyo are closely watching the Pan-American Conference that opens today, but their attitude is quite calm, believing that the American countries will not succumb to threats and enticements, and will focus on obtaining the truth. These countries are not expected to forget that Japan and the European Axis powers have no hostility whatsoever towards South America. For decades, the two sides have been good partners in commerce. Therefore, in theory, South American countries are not expected to conflict with countries that promote a new order. Tokyo also deeply hopes that the leading countries in South America can decisively reject the United States' attempts to provoke. The United States, under the pretext of defending the Western Hemisphere, is seizing bases in South America. The first to be harmed as a result will be South America, because Axis countries will have no choice but to drive the United States out of its newly established bases in order to eliminate the direct threat to itself. Japanese commentators all hope that Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and others can reject the United States' conspiracy. They should understand the value of the promises made by Britain and the United States to several European countries during the European war, and should not ignore the fact that the United States has been badly defeated by Japan. Why should South American countries throw themselves into a sinking ship, and why should they join hands with a nation with a gloomy future? Maintaining neutrality and not blindly following others would be the most beneficial policy for South America. May the leading politicians of South American countries think it over carefully.

### The Dutch East Indies Deputy Governor Van Mook Flies from Australia to Washington, Immediately Talks with Roosevelt and Hull, Discussing Military Strategy in the Southwest Pacific

Washington, 14th (Havas) – The Deputy Governor of the Dutch East Indies, Van Mook, accompanied by several Chinese military experts, arrived here today. At a time when the Japanese army is advancing rapidly in the South Pacific, causing widespread concern, this move is naturally noteworthy. Following repeated meetings between President Roosevelt, the Chinese Ambassador, and the Australian and Dutch ministers, the general expectation of a joint military commission for the Pacific regions seems to be confirmed. Military personnel unanimously believe that the establishment of such a commission is necessary. As the Japanese offensive spreads across a vast area of the Pacific, joint action is urgently needed. The Dutch East Indies and Australia have also contributed greatly to the establishment of a large-scale military strategic plan. As for the details of the plan, it is impossible to know due to military secrecy. According to well-informed sources, efforts to prevent the Japanese from occupying the Dutch East Indies are considered necessary. Once that area is lost, the United Kingdom and the United States will lose a major source of oil and rubber, and the resistance in the Pacific region will collapse from then on.

Washington, 14th (Havas) – Van Mook will hold talks with President Roosevelt and Secretary of State Hull. It is widely believed that the focus of the talks will be on the Dutch East Indies joining the Supreme Strategic Committee led by General Wavell, Commander-in-Chief of the Southwest Pacific Theater. However, the details are unknown.

Washington, 15th (Reuters) – Dr. Van Mook, Deputy Governor of the Dutch East Indies, arrived here yesterday by plane after meeting with Australian authorities last week. He immediately visited the U.S. State Department. He stated that the flight from Australia via the Dutch East Indies to here encountered no unexpected incidents.

### Australian Prime Minister Not Planning to Go to the United States

London, 14th (Havas) – According to news from Australia, Australian Prime Minister Curtin may not be going to the United States. Curtin has stated that in the current environment, Parliament believes it is necessary for the Prime Minister to remain in the country.

Sydney, 14th (Havas) – Former Australian Minister for the Army, Spender, expressed deep dissatisfaction with Australia sending liaison officers to maintain contact with the United Kingdom. He stated that Australians are tired of hearing empty words and now need practical action. Australia is not afraid of war but wishes to be in a proactive position. Australia is not only involved in the Pacific war but also related to wars everywhere, so it should participate in all operational plans. In particular, a special committee should be established in the Pacific area so that Australia can directly send personnel to participate.

Shanghai, 15th (Haitong News Agency) – According to a report from Melbourne yesterday, Dedman, the Australian Minister for War Organization and Industrial Research, is now planning to organize European refugees into labor camps so that these refugees can put their feelings into practice. It is also learned that Prime Minister Curtin had several hours of discussions with the newly formed planning committee. The committee's task is to cooperate with the Allied countries in the Pacific region. The Melbourne Herald speculates that the discussions concerned how the Allied countries can help Australia. It is said that the content of the discussions may be announced next week.

### Permission for National Rice to be Transported Freely, Rice Reserves Increase Further; Shanghai Municipal Council Rice Sales Outlets Will Sell Broken Rice

The authorities of the two concessions have been actively trying to adjust the rice supply in the city. However, due to the outbreak of the Pacific War and the disruption of shipping between Shanghai and Hong Kong, large quantities of foreign rice could not be transported to Shanghai for sale as planned. It is now learned that the two authorities are actively working to increase rice reserves and improve methods for citizens to purchase rice, encouraging rice merchants to procure rice. Therefore, the supply of rice in the market will gradually improve.

The Shanghai Municipal Council recently issued a notice stating that the rice sales outlets at Fair Road, Gordon Road, and Hua Shen Road under the council will also sell broken rice starting from Monday, the 19th of this month. Each three liters will be sold for three yuan and twenty cents in national currency. The sale of broken rice will be held every other week.

National Rice Shipments to Shanghai Increase Sharply

Yesterday, a responsible spokesperson for the Shanghai Municipal Council's Rice Management Committee stated that the reason the two authorities allowed the free transport of national rice was to increase rice reserves. It is expected that the amount of national rice shipped to Shanghai will increase even more in the future. In the past week, the number of merchants transporting rice from various rice-producing areas to Shanghai has been increasing daily, estimated to reach a total of 2,500 bags per day. Therefore, the amount of rice on the market has increased sharply, and the selling price has been falling daily, with transaction prices only reaching around 170 to 180 yuan in legal currency per stone.

Continued Distribution of Foreign Rice at Retail Outlets

The Shanghai Municipal Council's Rice Office continued to process the registration, payment, and issuance of transport permits for rice shops to sell foreign rice yesterday. Yesterday, a total of about 2,400 bags of rice were transported out of the warehouses. It is understood that rice shops that have received foreign rice from warehouses will sell it at retail outlets at the listed price as soon as the rice is transported to the shop. Those purchasing rice must dye their fingers with cyan scientific ink to indicate that the citizen has already purchased rice once on that day. This method has been implemented by the rice shops for some time now, and it has been progressing smoothly. However, some citizens are using various chemicals and solutions to wash off the ink on the same day, attempting to purchase rice a second time. Therefore, this method still needs to be improved by the authorities.

Closed Rice Shops Request to Reopen

About 300 rice shops have been ordered to close by the two concession authorities, and about 2,000 shop employees have lost their jobs and are finding it difficult to make a living. They plan to request that the authorities allocate foreign rice for them to sell in order to maintain their livelihoods. They are now rushing to complete the application procedures and will immediately request relief from the two authorities. As for the rumors that the closed rice shops are requesting the return of their business licenses in order to sell national rice, this is not true.

Moving Funds to Assist Students in Difficult Times

Mr. Wang Bingrong wrote in a letter: "To whom it may concern, the 13th of this month marks the 80th anniversary of my late father's death. I originally planned to perform some Buddhist rituals according to custom to fulfill my duty as a son. However, considering the difficulties of the world and the hardships of the times, rather than spending money on uncertain paths, it is better to transfer it to help students. I now submit a check for 1,000 yuan in legal currency, which I ask to be included under the readers' scholarship fund." Mr. Wang's enthusiasm for helping needy students is admirable.

Cambridge English College Donates Ten Places

Cambridge English College wrote in a letter: "To whom it may concern, the fall semester of the 30th year of this school has ended yesterday. The academic reports of all scholarship recipients and free students recommended by your newspaper have also been reviewed and finalized, and will be sent directly to the parents of each student for verification within a few days. The results of the evaluation show that they are able to work hard, encourage themselves, and strive forward, which is somewhat gratifying to your newspaper and the philanthropists who are enthusiastic about helping students. In recent times, life has become increasingly difficult, and the number of students dropping out of school has doubled. Although this school is facing daily difficulties, we should still do what we can to follow in the footsteps of all of you and continue to contribute modestly. Therefore, we ask your newspaper to continue to recommend ten free students to study in the evening classes. Although the number is small, we hope that all schools in the city will respond together. Then the students will be fortunate, and the society will be fortunate."

### Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau Increases Deposit and Withdrawal Amounts; 120 Yuan Can Be Withdrawn Each Week

The Shanghai Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau had previously stipulated restrictions on the amount of savings that the public could withdraw from the bureau, allowing only 20 yuan per person per day, totaling 120 yuan per week. In order to facilitate the withdrawal and use of funds by depositors, it has been decided that from today, each depositor will be allowed to withdraw 120 yuan once a week. The notice from the bureau is transcribed as follows: "It is hereby announced that from today until further notice, the withdrawal amount for savings account deposits is specially increased. Each account holder may withdraw up to 120 yuan per week. However, if no withdrawals have been made in several weeks, the unwithdrawn amounts from previous weeks cannot be combined and included in future withdrawals. Funds deposited after December 8, 1930, are not subject to this restriction. As for maturing fixed-term deposits and special current deposits, if the principal does not exceed the above-mentioned limit, the principal and interest can be paid in full. If it exceeds the above-mentioned limit, it can be transferred to a savings account and handled according to the savings account withdrawal restrictions. For maturing fixed-term deposits, interest will be paid for continued deposits. It is urgent to notify all parties for awareness. This notice."

### Private Trading Still Exists in Shanghai Stock Market; Stock Prices Drop Sharply Compared to Before the Pacific War; Reopening of the Exchange Is Difficult to Achieve

The English-language "Great American Evening News" reports that stocks that were previously traded on the exchange are now still being bought and sold privately. However, the number of transactions has decreased significantly. Today (the 15th), the buying and selling prices of these stocks have risen considerably compared to the prices in the last three weeks of last year. However, compared to the closing prices of the exchange before the outbreak of the Pacific War, they have still fallen significantly.

Private Trading Once Saw a Boom

In the past few days, the shares of Ewo Yarns have been fluctuating between 30 and 35 yuan, Wheelock around 80 yuan, and Asia Navigation near 12 yuan. These prices have more than doubled compared to the asking prices after the outbreak of the Pacific War. However, compared to the average market prices in the two weeks before the outbreak of the war, they have fallen by fifteen percent. Private trading of rubber stocks once saw a boom, but it was short-lived. As soon as the Japanese attacked Malaya, the prices plummeted. The shares of rubber companies with rubber plantations in the Dutch East Indies fell less. There are currently buyers for these shares, but the prices are only half of what they were before the war. The share prices of rubber companies with rubber plantations in Malaya have naturally fallen even more.

Rumors of Reopening Are Not Optimistic

Some of the private stock trading in Shanghai recently is only to cover short positions before the outbreak of the war. In addition, many people who actually hold stocks are selling them off because they need cash, and the lower prices are attracting buyers who have been waiting for an opportunity. In the past six weeks, there have been repeated rumors that the exchange is about to reopen. However, people in the stock market are no longer as optimistic about the possibility of the exchange reopening as before.

### Large Gambling Den Raided in Xinchang Lane, North Zhejiang Road; Thirty-Four Bosses Each Sentenced to Eight Months Imprisonment; One Hundred and Two Gamblers Fined Sixty Yuan

Detective Mao Ya of the Public Concession Police's Gambling Arrest Team, Detective Liao Zhonggan, and Detective Inspector Feng Qishan recently learned that a large number of gamblers were organizing gambling dens in the area of the Huisi Police Station. The largest of these was the Zhejiang Tea Room at No. 14, Xinchang Lane, North Zhejiang Road Bridge North Pier (there are also Chengji Tea Room in Chengji Lane, North Zhejiang Road, Hongxing Tea Room in Haining Road Hongxing Lane, etc., which are being organized). It employs a large number of male and female staff members, attracting general gamblers. They gamble day and night, with large amounts of money being won and lost. There are hundreds of men and women mixed together. They immediately sent informants in, pretending to be gamblers, and secretly investigated. They learned that the so-called Zhejiang Tea Room was indeed a gambling den, with Hu Hongdang and Shen Kui as shareholders. There were four gambling tables inside, divided into big and small, pai gow, and shake-the-dice games. Therefore, at 4:30 p.m. the day before yesterday, they secretly went to the Zhejiang Tea Room at No. 14, Xinchang Lane, and arrested the bosses Yang Zhenglin, Wang Zhiyuan, You Sansheng, Sun Mingsheng, Zhou Yongsheng, Rong Jin, Shen A'kui, Wu Renqing, Tan Meiyu, Li Jinmao, Cai Aijun, etc., a total of thirty-four people, and the gamblers Jiang A'xi, Tang Honghai, etc., a total of two hundred and thirty-six people. Five dice cups, one silver box, more than two thousand yuan in cash, and dice, chips, and gambling equipment were seized and taken to the Huisi Police Station for detention. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Special First Court. However, due to the large number of people, Judge Zhu temporarily opened the trial in the Criminal Court of the Second Branch. In addition to prosecuting them separately according to the law, the police lawyer Qian Xunjiu requested that the court impose heavy sentences on the defendants in order to maintain order, as this kind of disguised gambling den is being organized in large numbers. The court sentenced the thirty-four male and female bosses to eight months imprisonment each, and the two hundred and two gamblers to a fine of sixty yuan each. Among them, the defendants Yuan Shenggen, Ding A'mao, and Zhang Baochai had previously been wanted and were ordered to be transferred to the execution court for review. The gambling equipment and gambling money were confiscated.

### Police Department Issues Urgent Notice to Strictly Prevent Extortion

The Public Concession Police Department recently issued an urgent notice stating that recently, there have often been unemployed hooligans extorting money in the name of military agencies, or foreign hooligans impersonating police detectives, mixing into residents' homes, and stealing property. In order to prevent the activities of these unscrupulous elements, all sectors of society are requested to pay attention. In addition to the Chinese and foreign police officers of the police station wearing uniforms and plainclothes detectives carrying official licenses, residents can ask them to show their licenses when performing their duties. In the future, if residents encounter the above-mentioned intimidation, they should immediately report it to the patrol police or notify the police station.

### Summary of Theft Cases

At 3:30 p.m. yesterday, five bandits suddenly arrived at the Shanzhong Printing and Dyeing Factory in Kaixuan Lane, Tianjin Road, Public Concession. Four of them showed handguns and first drove all the employees into a corner of the room and tied them up one by one with lead wire ropes brought by the bandits. They looted 4,000 yuan in cash, one felt hat, and one coat (worth about 400 yuan). When they were about to escape through the gate, the gatekeeper police officer No. 467, unaware of the robbery, came to ask what was going on and was also tied up by the bandits. His service pistol and five bullets were also looted, and the bandits escaped without a trace.

At about 9 p.m. the night before last, six bandits suddenly broke into a household at No. 658, Dongjing Road. They looted a bicycle and jewelry worth about 900 yuan.

At about 6 a.m. yesterday, No. 270, Tianjin Road, was suddenly visited by three thieves, one holding a handgun. They looted 35 pieces of clothing worth 1,300 yuan and escaped.

### Lost and Found Fountain Pen

To whom it may concern, at 2 p.m. today, I found a red men's fountain pen on the sidewalk in front of the Taikang Company at the intersection of Nanjing Road and Yunnan Road. Unable to find the owner, I handed it over to Chinese police officer No. 1644, who took it back to the police station for safekeeping. The owner can claim it at the Laozha Police Station.

Business News

### Public Debt Surges Before and After

In the public debt market, the bullish trend continues, and trading is quite lively. Although there are many sellers, buyers are also very active. It is said that certain banks are no longer paying interest on newly opened current accounts, which shows the crowding of deposits and the scarcity of uses for funds. Currently, the consolidation of funds has become a problem. Therefore, any market that it flows into will rise sharply, which shows the mischief of hot money. Yesterday, Xinhua, Hengkang, Yiji, and Tongyi were launched or sold off, while Lianyi and Hengxing were very strong. Defu also bought Category A bonds. Therefore, Category C bonds initially opened at 65 yuan, rose to 6 yuan and 5 corners, returned to 4 yuan and 6 corners once, but still broke through 5 yuan, closing at 5 yuan and 2 corners. Category A bonds have broken through the 70 yuan mark, trading at 70 yuan and 5 corners, closing at 70 yuan and 3 corners. Category B bonds opened at 66 yuan and 4 corners, fell slightly to 5 yuan and 9 corners, but still closed at 6 yuan and 3 corners. Category D bonds opened at 61 yuan and 7 corners, rose to 2 yuan and 3 corners, and closed at 2 yuan and 1 corner. Category E bonds opened at 62 yuan and 9 corners, rose to 2 yuan and 8 corners, reached 3 yuan and 2 corners, and closed at 3 yuan and 1 corner. The trend is still very firm, rising another 1 to 5 corners compared to the previous day. The trading volume was about 800,000 yuan.

### Tianjin Market Higher Than Shanghai; Gold Price Decline Gradually Stabilizes

Yesterday, the cash spot market for gold fell first and then suddenly rose. After falling below the 11,000 yuan mark, it immediately rebounded. The opening gold price in Tianjin was 4,200 yuan in United Reserve Notes per tael, which is 12,180 yuan in national currency at the rate of 2.9 yuan. The sentiment of all parties turned from weak to firm, and a certain gold shop raised its prices. However, due to speculation that hoarding gold would be unfavorable, there were many sellers with actual goods. Although the price rebounded limitedly, the initial price in the morning (ten taels) continued the previous day's weakness and was within 11,000 yuan. Gonghe sold 10 taels each to Lemao and Chengji, with the first transaction price being 10,850 yuan, 200 yuan lower than the opening. Tongkang Yongjin bought at 10,950 yuan. Two gold shops and the money exchange Shunyuan sold, falling back to 10,800 yuan, at which time Chengji Hongchang and the Cash Gold Shop bought in, raising the price to 11,000 yuan. A certain gold shop raised prices very vigorously, and a jewelry shop sold 10 taels to a gold shop, with the highest price being 11,280 yuan. Finally, two gold shops traded 10 taels with each other at 11,270 yuan, 220 yuan higher than the previous day. The difference for the day was 480 yuan. A total of 1,100 to 1,200 taels were traded in various places. The price of gold jewelry in jewelry shops was slightly higher by 50 yuan at around 10 o'clock, being 1,150 yuan. By 11:30, it returned to the original price, still listing at 1,200 yuan (purchase price reduced by 200 yuan). Silver was still listed at 16 yuan, and the black market price rose slightly to 11.5 yuan.

### National Rice Trading Suddenly Becomes Active

Various Types of Japonica Rice Drop by Another 4 to 5 Yuan; Edible Oil and Grains Still Tight

After the two concession authorities issued a public notice yesterday allowing the free transport of national rice, with no need to apply for transit permits and no restrictions, trading in the market suddenly became lively. However, as goods from the countryside and neighboring areas increased, and rice merchants sent personnel to procure rice from various routes, in addition to the increased number of peddlers along the way yesterday, there were also more than 300 bags of new goods reported and sampled on the market. The source of supply may increase further in the future. Therefore, the market price showed a continued decline during trading activities. Yesterday, the prices of various types of northern and southern Japonica rice fell by another 4 to 5 yuan. However, after repeated price cuts recently, Indica rice has attracted low-price absorption from shops, factories, and small traders, and the owners are unwilling to sell at low prices. The market has stabilized. Yesterday, Indica rice opened at 194 yuan, the same as the day before yesterday; mixed rice opened at 203 to 4 yuan. Sales of northern and southern Japonica rice increased as ordinary citizens who could not buy foreign rice switched to buying national rice. Therefore, in addition to the lively peddling along the way, the rice shops also stocked this for sale. The selling price of small vendors was 18 to 19 yuan per dou, and the rice shops were only around 20 yuan. The market price was also lower for early and late rice, ranging from 193 to 91 yuan, and the slightly worse rice was only 190 yuan. The transaction volume also increased to 330 to 340 dan.

There were not many transactions in edible oil, but most holders were unwilling to sell. The market situation was tight. 300 dan of clear oil from the Dayou Factory were sold at 288 to 90 yuan, up another 1 to 2 yuan compared to the previous day.

Soybeans were still sluggish yesterday. The owners continued to raise prices by another 2 to 3 yuan. The total market transaction volume was 20 bags of Tianjin green beans, priced at 110 to 111 yuan, and 10 bags of Pinghu broad beans, priced at 123 yuan.

### Cotton Yarn Falls Back After Rising

The yarn market initially rose, then became sluggish, trending ordinarily. This is because current sales are clear, and people's sentiment is soft. Except for some laxity in the Double Horse factory orders, other aspects are stable with little fluctuation. The Double Horse factory orders for 20-count yarn opened higher as many who had profited previously returned to buy, fearing the typhoon. The opening price was 1,750 yuan, up 10 yuan. Soon, buying became stronger, with more buying than selling at one point. The market gradually advanced, briefly rising to 1,805 yuan. Unexpectedly, high prices led to profit-taking and active short-selling. Simultaneously, it was heard that current yarn transactions were not as brisk as the previous day, and momentum weakened, falling to 1,730 yuan at closing, down 5 yuan from the previous day. 42-count Blue Phoenix was at 4,090 yuan to 4,100 yuan, Water Moon at 4,120 yuan, Li Ma at 4,100 yuan, 32-count Immortal Peach at 3,255 yuan, 20-count Double Horse spot goods at 2,090 yuan to 2,150 yuan, Heavenly Girl at 2,620 yuan to 2,660 yuan, new tax Heavenly Girl at 2,700 yuan, Moon at 2,200 yuan to 2,290 yuan, Double Globe at 1,900 yuan for factory orders and 2,020 yuan for spot goods, Spring Ox at 2,210 yuan, 18-count Weaver Girl at 1,930 yuan to 1,990 yuan, 16-count Great Treasure at 1,770 yuan, and Lucky Swallow at 1,825 yuan.

Cotton had seen a brief period of excitement in the past. Recently, after the US and British commercial yarn factories announced closures, trade was hit again, leading to sluggish market prices.

Spring and Autumn

### Second Landlords Urgently Need to Reflect

— Jin Yi

Second landlords in the Shanghai concessions have been "darlings of fortune" for the past four or five years. Merely living rent-free and covering expenses with "official fees" can be considered conscientious. Demanding tips for a kitchen and requiring two years' rent in advance for an attic room were shocking conditions seen in written advertisements. White-collar workers living on salaries, after working thirty days, already spent the largest portion of their income on a tiny room that barely provided shelter. Food, clothing, and transportation were secondary. However, "accidents" continued to happen: the primary landlord renovating, the second landlord's son getting married, taking back the property for personal use. There was always the threat of being forced to live in the open. Helpless, they increased the rent to resolve the matter. It truly was difficult to have a job, and even more difficult to be unemployed!

However, looking at the rental advertisements now, not only are phrases like "tips" eliminated, but the only condition remaining is "no rental without a guarantor." Presumably, having a few more children is also not a problem. This is naturally related to "more than 300,000 people having returned to their hometowns." However, this is just the beginning. As the unemployed are forced to return home, those with jobs also face uncertainty. An increasing number of people will inevitably say, "Let's go home!" By then, even if "red slips" (advertisements) fly everywhere, and the air in south-facing rooms is good, they will still have to be left vacant. This isn't schadenfreude on the part of third tenants. When the "darlings of fortune" reach their end, the sorrow of the third tenants will be even greater. Being able to live peacefully for one more day is a blessing for both parties. How to retain future "return-home candidates" is something second landlords should seriously consider.

### The City is Wasting Away

— Yu Yu

With a protruding belly, the city trembles in the cold wind.

Dozing off, the neon lights tightly close their eyes. A powerless broadcast plays a dull tune.

"Tick-tock," in one second, the city eliminates ten thousand cells (ten thousand more starved corpses lie by the roadside), and the electric current hums the funeral song ten thousand times.

Trembling, covering ears, closing windows, sealing off one's own body, the soul ventures into the dark roads. —— Young people wither silently, one by one.

"It's better to return home!"

Thus, carrying bundles of clothes, supporting the old and leading the young, they stumble on their feet, heading towards their own, their own homeland...

The city's belly is empty, though it still protrudes high, it cannot withstand the onslaught of the cold wind. It gradually wastes away, gradually wastes away.

"Jade Shatters, Pearls Scatter" Chen Lu

### "Jade Shatters, Pearls Scatter" "Forever and Ever"

"Jade Shatters, Pearls Scatter," which will be screened at the Golden Capital, is Bai Hong's latest work after "Orphan Island Spring and Autumn." The interlude "Goodbye Sasha" in "Orphan Island Spring and Autumn" has already become popular in dance halls. In "Jade Shatters, Pearls Scatter," there are two new interludes, one called "My Nostalgia" and the other "Separation Longing," both of which are very melancholic and sure to be popular.

Jin Xing's next work after "Jade Shatters, Pearls Scatter" has been decided to be "Forever and Ever," directed by Shu Shi, starring Bai Hong, Murong Wan'er, and Qiao Qi. Filming began at the Datong studio from the day before yesterday. Jin Xing's contract with Datong is for one year, and from February 1st, filming will also take place at the Meicheng factory to increase productivity.

### Autumn Begonia

— Qin Shouou

Sixteen: The Fire of Youth

"Are you going again tomorrow?" Xiangqi smiled at him slightly.

"Of course I'm going," Shao Hua said, hanging his tie in the closet, pretending to be serious, "Aunt! You don't know that a young person needs exercise the most. In Shanghai now, almost no outdoor sports can be held, so we have to do some indoor sports, and playing ping pong is the most suitable indoor sport. Aunt, didn't you play it when you were at school?"

"Of course I played, but not like you, always playing at night."

Shao Hua's face turned red again involuntarily.

"And the place at home is also very big, why don't you invite them here too?" Xiangqi's gaze, like two needles, fixed on Shao Hua's face. "You bother people every day, don't you feel sorry?"

"Mom might not agree with this, she's most afraid of us making noise at home." Shao Hua勉强想出一个理由来抗辩。"Moreover, Aunt, let me tell you, there's also a cousin who just returned from the North at my classmate's house, who speaks very good Mandarin, and we all want to learn from her..."

Before Shao Hua finished speaking, Xiangqi laughed.

"So that's the reason! How old is that young lady at the moment?"

Shao Hua knew that lying had caused problems, and almost couldn't answer out of embarrassment.

"This... this I haven't asked..." (305)

Miscellany of Entertainment

### Liubo

— Zefu

Among the various games in our country, Liubo is the earliest, traditionally believed to have been created by Wu Cao, a minister of Xia Jie. The character "Bo" was originally written as "Bu," meaning to throw six dice and move six pieces, hence the name Liubo. The dice were also called "Qiong" and made of bamboo. The pieces were similar to the pieces in Go. This game was only popular before the Han Dynasty, and later no one knew about it. According to the ancient Book of Bo, the rules of the game involved two people sitting opposite each other. The board was divided into twelve paths, with the middle of both ends called water. There were twelve pieces in total, six white and six black. Two fish were also placed in the water. During the game, the dice were first thrown. The dice had four colors, and the one with the highest score could move the pieces first. When a piece moved to a place, it could enter the water to eat the fish. Each time a fish was captured, two chips were gained; flipping a fish gained three chips; if six chips were gained, it was a major victory. According to this description, the board is quite similar to modern Xiangqi, except that there are two fish in the middle, and there are also separate chips. Furthermore, one must throw the dice to move the pieces, and the number of pieces is only six for each person, which is very different. Also, the dice are the origin of later dice. The four colors each have a name. The Book of Bo says: "A mark of one stroke is called 'Sai', a mark of two strokes is called 'Bai', a mark of three strokes is called 'Hei', and one side without a mark is called 'Wu.'" This is also very similar to dice. The Chu Ci says, "Call for five Bai," meaning that five Bai is the largest, and one stroke is the smallest.
