### Rumors of US Convoy Sailing to Australia for Reinforcements; Australian Prime Minister Sends Letter to Roosevelt; Port Moresby Continues to Be Attacked

Washington, 12th – There are rumors that a large U.S. convoy is transporting troops to reinforce Australia, but military authorities along the Pacific coast are remaining completely silent. However, it is generally believed that this is a necessary move in the grand strategy of the Allied nations. Judging from recent developments, the situation in the Pacific has become extremely urgent since the fall of Java and the crisis in Australia. Residents of the U.S. Pacific coast, due to their geographical proximity to Australia and their close ties, are hoping that U.S. Flying Fortresses will quickly fly to Australia to assist the Australians in their fight.

Tokyo, 13th (Domei News Agency) – The General Headquarters announced at 3:34 PM today that Japanese naval air groups launched a major attack on Port Moresby, New Guinea, on the 10th of this month. Sixteen enemy aircraft were hit and caught fire, and many important military installations were destroyed. In addition, several Japanese destroyers sank a British minesweeper while searching for enemy ships in the Java Sea on the 5th of this month.

Washington, 12th (Havas News Agency) – The Australian Federal Minister to the United States, Casey, presented President Roosevelt with a letter from the Australian Prime Minister Curtin today but refused to disclose the contents of the letter.

Lisbon, 13th (Haitong News Agency) – Well-informed sources in Washington believe that the Australian Prime Minister's letter concerns a new plan for the defense of Australia and New Zealand, which is being submitted to Roosevelt for approval.

Sydney, 10th (Reuters) – The Sydney Morning Herald correspondent in Port Moresby reports that Japan may soon launch a large-scale air offensive against Australian bases in New Guinea, or even the Australian continent. Australian aircraft are currently bombing certain bases with great courage, sometimes diving to altitudes as low as a thousand feet. Currently, Japanese forces have only made limited progress in some areas. After the Australian forces withdrew from Lae and Salamaua, as well as other areas on the north coast of New Guinea, their guerrilla units remain active behind enemy lines. Japanese forces are now dispersing their troops to avoid being targeted by Australian aircraft. It will be extremely difficult for the Japanese to advance north or southeast via the Owen Stanley Range.

### Song Ziwen Issues Statement

Washington, 12th (Reuters) – Song Ziwen told reporters today that supplies for China have begun to be transported via a new route. The development of this new route is like the Burma Road, and its transport capacity will exceed that of the Burma Road within a few months. When asked if China was receiving sufficient assistance, Song replied that there was never a time when there was enough during wartime. Transportation is the main problem. The United States is eager to ship more materials to China than China is currently receiving. Song believes that the future solution to the India problem is crucial for China, as it is for the United States, because we are interconnected. Song's remarks were made after his meeting with President Roosevelt. Song declined to comment on the details of his meeting with the President, saying only that today's meeting was one of his personal visits to discuss the general situation with the President.

The work of the Sino-British Cultural Association has progressed from a purely cultural nature to a political one since the outbreak of the war. Both China and Britain have made contributions to human culture. We hope that during Ambassador Seymour's tenure in China, we can fulfill our duty to maintain past contributions and accomplish the greatest mission. The British Ambassador then gave a reply.

### British Cabinet Minister Cripps Visits India with a Major Mission; Expected to Stay for Six Weeks

London, 13th (Reuters) – A Reuters political correspondent reports that Sir Stafford Cripps, carrying British Cabinet proposals for resolving the Indian political situation, is expected to arrive in India soon to fulfill his extremely important mission. Among his team of associates are Canadian economist Mr. Spry and political economy planning expert Mr. Owen. Key officials from the British India Office do not need to go to India, as Indian government officials have sufficient economic expertise. The route of Mr. Cripps' trip to India will be kept secret and will only be revealed after his safe return to Britain. It is expected that Mr. Cripps' trip will last at least six weeks, but the length of his stay will depend on the progress of his discussions with Indian leaders.

New York, 12th (Reuters) – India's first representative to the United States, Bajpai, told reporters that Prime Minister Churchill's statement in the House of Commons was very gratifying, and that the appointment of Cripps as a special envoy was especially commendable, as Cripps is one of the most sympathetic figures in British politics towards India. Mr. Jute, Chairman of the Federation of Indian Associations in the United States, said that Churchill's decision to send Cripps to resolve the Indian problem was very welcome. Cripps has a broad vision, is an old friend of Nehru, understands the views of nationalists, and is familiar with Mr. Jinnah, the leader of the National Congress, and understands his attitude. It is expected that Cripps, in cooperation with the Governor-General of India, will complete his mission.

Cripps' Mission is Arduous

New York, 13th (Havas News Agency) – The New York Sun commented this morning on the visit of British Lord Privy Seal Sir Stafford Cripps to India, stating that resolving the Indian problem to encourage India to fully assist the Allied nations is a matter of utmost urgency. Sir Stafford Cripps' trip may be a major factor in the victory of the Allied nations, but his mission is undoubtedly difficult and arduous. Giving complete freedom to the leaders of the Indian Congress may inevitably lead to riots and disturbances by Muslims, creating a state of anarchy. This is obvious even to the unintelligent. On this basis, Prime Minister Churchill must proceed cautiously and have obtained the agreement of Sir Stafford Cripps. In short, a solution that is likely to cause internal unrest in India is not worth emulating.

Japanese Army's Attack on India Must Wait Until the Rainy Season

Swiss Capital, 13th (Havas News Agency) – According to a special dispatch from the Swiss Daily News in London, London is very optimistic about the visit of Lord Privy Seal Sir Stafford Cripps to India and regards it as equally important as General Wavell's reappointment as Commander-in-Chief in India. It is said that Sir Stafford Cripps' plan is very broad, and the British government is willing to do anything related to the welfare of India and the welfare of its internal religions and races. However, military measures will not be relaxed due to political negotiations. The British military believes that if the Japanese army attacks India, the time will be before the summer rainy season, which will arrive in six or seven weeks. The target of the Japanese army's attack is unlikely to be the conquest of India, but rather to occupy key ports such as Calcutta, Madras, Ceylon, and Bombay to isolate India.

Mahatma Gandhi Expresses His Views

Swiss City, 12th (Havas News Agency) – According to news from New York, Mahatma Gandhi declared today in Wardha, India, that there are no signs of a resolution to the Indian problem. When asked how the British government should resolve this problem as soon as possible, Gandhi replied, "Your question is extremely subtle. I have various private opinions about British affairs. Although I have feelings for Britain, I still believe that British imperialism is a great crime against India. It would be best for Britain to recognize its mistakes and compensate for them accordingly. Unfortunately, I have not seen any signs of this."

American Delegation Departs for India

New York, 12th (Reuters) – Sir Austan, Chairman of the Indian Government Purchasing Commission, departed from here for India today with the American wartime production delegation.

### German Submarines Active in the Caribbean Sea; Saint Lucia Island Bombarded; Three British and American Ships Hit by Torpedoes

Berlin, 13th (Haitong News Agency) – The good news of a German submarine in Saint Lucia has been announced in the German military report. According to reports, the breakwater at Castries port was originally for protection, but a German submarine finally broke into its inner harbor. Two large ships anchored in front of the port were hit by torpedoes. One sank immediately, and the other capsized. Then, a loud explosion occurred, and the ammunition in the ship must have been destroyed. The water depth there is only thirty feet, so the sunken ship is still exposed above the water. The submarine also sank another ship carrying ammunition outside the port. German submarines have now expanded their scope of activities in Newfoundland, Halifax, New York, Delaware, the Florida Straits, the Caribbean Sea, and British Guiana. So far, they have sunk seventeen enemy ships. In addition to sinking merchant ships, German submarines have been quite effective in attacking enemy escort ships. In Canadian territorial waters, one patrol boat and one submarine destroyer have been sunk. Since German submarines have been operating off the coast of the United States, they have sunk a total of fifty oil tankers, approximately 385,000 tons. From January 24, 1942, to date, they have sunk a total of one hundred and fifteen merchant ships, approximately 772,000 tons, in American territorial waters.

### An Ominous Black Cat

Stockholm, Sweden, 13th (Haitong News Agency) – According to the London "Evening Standard," a black cat named Oscar has brought bad luck to several warships. The British Navy authorities have now decided to send the cat to live with a sailor's family in Northern Ireland to live out its life. Initially, Oscar was raised on the German battleship "Bismarck." When the ship sank, he was rescued by British sailors and raised on the British destroyer "Cossack." However, the ship was soon sunk as well. The cat was rescued again and moved to the British aircraft carrier "Ark Royal." Unexpectedly, the ship also sank. After the cat was rescued by an unknown warship, the naval authorities immediately ordered it to be sent to Northern Ireland.

Washington, 13th (Reuters) – The U.S. Navy Department announced that a U.S. medium-sized oil tanker has been hit by a torpedo in the Caribbean Sea. The name of the ship was not disclosed.

### Hu Shi Delivers Speech in the United States

New York, 12th (Special Dispatch) – Ambassador Hu Shi delivered a speech at a banquet at the Canadian Club today. Some commentators said that China's internal unity is a new achievement, but this is a complete misunderstanding. For 2,100 years, China has always had only one government, one legal system, and one civil service system. The Chinese people have always been accustomed to unity, so whenever the country is in danger, the Chinese people can overcome all difficulties. There are four reasons for China's success: first, internal solidarity; second, the ability to work hard; third, the assistance of friendly nations; and the most important factor is the perseverance and virtue of the Chinese people, who believe that justice will prevail, and therefore work together with perseverance. The West Tan Chamber of Commerce in New Jersey held a grand banquet to entertain Ambassador Hu. The Ambassador gave a speech, encouraging the Allied nations to learn from China's virtue of patience.

### Brazilian President Orders Confiscation of Axis Property; Restrictions on the Activities of Overseas Chinese; Berlin to Issue Statement

Brazilian Capital, 12th (Havas) – President Vargas today ordered the confiscation of some of the property of the Axis countries on the grounds that: These countries have engaged in acts of war against the American continent; Germany refuses to compensate for the losses suffered by Brazilian merchant ships; and Brazilian merchant ships were unarmed and were sunk while engaged in peaceful commerce. It is reported that the confiscated property will be deposited in Brazilian banks as a guarantee for Axis governments to compensate for Brazilian property. In addition, overseas Chinese from Axis countries may not transfer their assets to neutral countries, but this does not apply to those who continue to engage in ordinary business, although they must continue to pay profit taxes in accordance with the original tax rules.

Argentine Capital, 13th (Haitong News Agency) – A telegram from the Brazilian capital states that Brazilian President Vargas issued a decree yesterday confiscating the property and funds of overseas Chinese and companies from Germany, Italy, and Japan in retaliation for the sinking of Brazilian cargo ships. The confiscation methods are as follows: 10% will be confiscated for assets of 20 contos or more (1 conto is worth 50 US dollars); 20% will be confiscated for 100 contos or more; and 30% will be confiscated for more than 100 contos.

Lisbon, 13th (Haitong News Agency) – According to news last night, the Brazilian authorities have greatly restricted the activities of overseas Chinese and diplomatic personnel from Axis countries.

### 1942 is the Year of British Military Production; Powers of the New Minister of Production Expanded

London, 13th (Reuters) – The appointment of Minister of State Lyttelton as Minister of Military Production was welcomed by the House of Commons, which said that this appointment was necessary given that this year is the year of military production. The powers of Lyttelton's new position will be greatly expanded, and his position with respect to various military needs will be similar to that of Churchill's position as Minister of Defense with respect to the three services of the Navy, Army, and Air Force. He will decide which imported goods are necessary and which ordinary industries must reduce their output.

London, 12th (Havas News Agency) – Prime Minister Churchill recently delivered a speech in the House of Commons, stating that the government has now appointed the former British High Commissioner to the Middle East, Lyttelton, as Minister of Production. His main task is to supervise military production on behalf of the War Cabinet. The Minister should also: Guide the British members of the Anglo-American Joint Committee so that resources can be used to the greatest extent possible for the manufacture of armaments; Confer with the governments of various autonomous territories and colonies to implement general production plans to manufacture various necessary materials, machines, tools, and armaments; Be responsible for implementing import procedures and armament allocation matters. In addition, the Minister of Production should cooperate with the Minister of Labor to solve labor problems. As for the Navy Department, it will continue to manage the construction and armament of all warships, and draft naval fleet procedures. The decisions made by the Navy Department only need to be submitted to the Minister of Defense and the War Cabinet for approval. In addition, the Navy Department must be responsible for building merchant ships, arming merchant ships, and repairing merchant ships.

### The Mystery of the "Indian Spirit" and Reincarnation

An Indian account, which is now roughly summarized. However, looking closely, India is indeed a very mysterious country. Why? Look at the Javanese who invaded in the first time; they were always stuck in the realm of animals, with no way to be reborn. The Aryans, although troublesome, occupied India; can we still admit that they are not part of the Indian identity now? Alexander, although he also went to India, his achievement was only sending a "gift" of Greek culture, and he even burdened his descendants to become the meat of others. The progress of Islam has only resulted in wrapping the turbans of the Indians, forming deadly enemies with the Hindus. Afghanistan wasted a lot of manpower and resources, and only added some population to India. Could Genghis Khan's expedition be an exception? Although Britain has obtained two-thirds of Indian territory, how has it ever had a peaceful day in the past hundred years?

Moreover, the Indians are constantly clamoring for independence. In the last European war, Gandhi was fooled a little, but this time, I am afraid he will not eat empty tangyuan again; I heard that two great old men are responsible for it.

From this point of view, although the Indians are somewhat unambitious, it is only a material perspective. India has an indelible "Indian spirit". This spirit can be said to be religious belief, philosophical thought, or a special negative force, but since ancient times, through many storms, these Indians have never succumbed. Only to be assimilated by them is the fact. Can white people escape this example? The author does not need to waste words, please turn to Stevenson's "Beach of Falesá" to understand everything.

Buddha said "karma", although it delays the years, it is too soft, too decadent, and too "spiritual"; however, those who rule India will eventually not jump out of this circle of "karma" cycle. But then again: how many Indias are there in the world? One! Then it is clear that others cannot invoke the precedent to comfort themselves! Because the "Indian Spirit" is only a proprietary patented product of the Indians! (End)

### Deputy Consul General Hailin Arrives in Shanghai; Soviet Consulate General Opens; Mr. Hailin Arrives in Shanghai from Japan

The English-language "Great American Evening Post" states that it has been learned that Mr. Hailin, the acting Soviet Consul General in Shanghai, arrived in Shanghai from Japan on Wednesday, and that the Soviet Consulate on Huangpu Road is now open for business. Mr. Hailin is currently also the Second Secretary of the Soviet Embassy in Japan. The Soviet Consul General in Shanghai, Mr. Chai Leff, is still in Tokyo. According to reports, the Soviet Consulate on Huangpu Road in this city was closed in 1939, and all personnel were transferred elsewhere. Subsequently, the Soviet citizens and interests in this city were entrusted to the Norwegian Consul in Shanghai for management. In July 1941, they were reassigned to the Soviet Embassy in Japan for concurrent management. The officials of the consulate in Shanghai were also concurrently held by officials of the Embassy in Japan, while the consulate on Huangpu Road remained closed. It only opened for business when the Embassy in Japan sent personnel to Shanghai. After the outbreak of the Pacific War, the Soviet Embassy in Japan sent Chai Zefu, the Consul General stationed in Shanghai, to Shanghai in mid-January of this year to handle consulate affairs. The quiet arrival of acting Consul Hailin in Shanghai this time is believed to be for the same purpose.

### Stealing Stacked Goods and Killing the Watchman: Two Arrested

The Xianglan Electrical Material Company at 661 North Sichuan Road, established by the Japanese Kishikawa, had its warehouse at 1-5 Huaxingfang, Changchun Road, Zhabei. The warehouse had frequent thefts. Therefore, in January of this year, they

Hired an Indian Watchman

They hired an Indian named Hara Ting, 36 years old, as a watchman to guard the premises. On the night of February 22nd, around 7 p.m., Zhu Jinshan from Changzhou, Yu Zheng from Jiangbei, and A Ting, all former workers of the company, suddenly came to the warehouse with concealed weapons, intending to steal. Hara Ting discovered them and grabbed Zhu Jinshan. Zhu immediately brandished a sharp blade and threatened him. While struggling with Mr. Ha, A Ting also took out a sharp knife,

Stabbing Him to Death

Stabbing Mr. Ha in the mouth, causing a deep wound, with the knife tip protruding from the back of his neck. He fell into a pool of blood, barely breathing, unable to shout. Thinking he was not dead, they dragged Mr. Ha to Room 5, placed him face down on the ground, covered him with reed mats, and pressed five bundles of heavy goods on top of him, causing him to die shortly after. The group then stole 48 dozen white porcelain light bulb shells, worth over a thousand yuan, and fled with the loot. The watchman had a Chinese woman named Zhang A Yu, who lived with the deceased at 240 Jiaxing Road. That evening, when Zhang brought dinner to the warehouse, she knocked on the door for a long time, but no one answered.

Discovery of the Body

She rushed to the office to report. Together with the foreman, she fetched the key and went to open the door. After searching everywhere for Mr. Ha without success, she reported to the Disweilu Police Station, which ordered detectives to investigate. They discovered Mr. Ha's body, with the murder weapon still inserted in his mouth. The Swiss Consulate examined the body and arranged for its burial. The day before yesterday afternoon, Li Wenbin, a Chinese detective inspector, and Ma Zhiyin, a detective, from the Disweilu Police Station, arrested the suspects Zhu Jinshan and Yu Zheng. They also recovered the original stolen goods at the Hengtai and Yuelai Hardware Stores on Tiantong Road and Disweilu and brought them to the police station. Zhu and Yu both confessed to going together, but claimed that A Ting was the one who stabbed the Indian to death, and they only assisted from the side. They were ordered to be detained for further investigation.

He accidentally lost his footing and fell off the bus, rolling under the wheels. His left foot was crushed by the wheel, and he bled profusely, suffering severe injuries. Passersby called for an ambulance, which transported the injured man to the hospital for treatment. Recently, public transportation vehicles have been crowded, and leaving the doors open easily causes accidents. Both ticket sellers and passengers should pay attention.

### Refugee Relief: Giving Funds to Leave, Striving to Achieve the Goal of Sending Everyone Away; Still 9,291 People Remaining

The Shanghai Refugee Relief Association, recently recognizing the difficulty in procuring food and the sharp decrease in donations from various sources, making it impossible to continue, convened various relief organizations to discuss jointly.

It was originally scheduled to disperse everyone on March 15th. If the number of people is too large, the procedures may not be completed in time, so the date may have to be slightly delayed to achieve the goal of sending everyone away. It is heard that the association's expenses for this repatriation are quite high, with each adult receiving 50 national currency and each child receiving 38 yuan. The association has a small number of staff and is also willing to see the matter through to the end, dissolving at the same time.

### Rumors Abound, Double Horse Plummets, Current Yarn Still Stable

The cotton yarn market is experiencing large ups and downs, but the current market conditions are still stable. 20-count Bian Ma Factory single yarn initially jumped to 3,400 yuan. One Yun Jian dropped to 3,240 yuan. It was a period of fluctuation for quite some time. Later, rumors arose, saying that military notes were declining, and it plummeted to the 3,000 yuan level, closing at 2,910 yuan. 42-count Lanfeng was initially priced at 7,100 yuan, then 7,050 yuan. 42-count Mao Die was 6,500 yuan, 42-count Shiguang was 6,940 yuan. 20-count Shuiyue was 4,250 yuan, then 4,100 yuan. 20-count Yueqin was 3,910 yuan. 20-count Shuang Wei spot goods were 3,640 yuan, then 3,540 yuan. 20-count Tiannv was 3,550 yuan. Spot 10-count Shiyi was 3,430 yuan, 10-count Tongzigun was 2,500 yuan, 14-count Jinta was 3,400 yuan.

### Cloth Registration Also Being Handled, Market Already Seeing a Sharp Decline

The factory cloth market opened yesterday with some upward momentum, but then fell back, due to unfavorable rumors about the Shuang Ma Yarn Factory, which affected the cloth market. The sharp rise in cloth prices in recent days has made it difficult for sales outlets to sell, and demand is very weak, so prices have softened. Selling prices opened high and closed low, with significant differences. Earth Brand sheeting was 145 yuan to 133 yuan, Da Peng sheeting was 144 yuan to 132 yuan, 8-pound Zhenzhong was 86 yuan to 83 yuan, White Cat floral cloth was 128 yuan to 122 yuan. Kishi Lin cloth was 225 yuan to 220 yuan, and Blue Magnolia bleached cloth was 150 to 145 yuan. Approximately 200 pieces were traded on this street.

Eastern cloth initially opened higher due to the continued rise in military notes and the continued strong demand from off-market hoarders, with prices for all cloths reaching new highs. However, the market quickly became weak and declined sharply. It is heard that registration of inventory and movement permits is imminent, which has prompted general profit-takers to sell. Longtou sheeting opened at 182 yuan for new orders, rose sharply to 188 and a half yuan, and then fell back to 172 yuan at noon. In the afternoon, it was 165 yuan when it opened, rose to 170 yuan, and then fell to 162 yuan, before rising again to 167 yuan and five jiao at the close, a decrease of 10 yuan and 5 jiao per piece compared to before the border closure. Spot Longtou sheeting was even weaker, at only 144 yuan and five jiao. Sijunzi Fengji Factory orders for October to December were 5 yuan, 1 jiao, and 5 fen. Red orders for July to September were 4 yuan and 9 jiao. Old orders were 4 yuan and 7 jiao.

### Cash Plummets After Rising Sharply, Military Notes Enter 7-Plus Yuan Mark

Yesterday's cash dark market, after rising first, suddenly plummeted, successively retreating to within the 20,000 yuan and 18,000 yuan levels. This was due to various rumors, and the military notes, which had recently risen too much, had returned to within the 7-plus yuan level. The collapse of cotton yarn and the massive dumping by Tianjin gangs have triggered a selling frenzy. The market opened in chaos as high as 20,500 yuan, up 2,900 yuan from the noon close before the holiday (the 11th), and 100 yuan higher than the off-market price on the previous day. Cash houses and silver houses sold down to 20,300 yuan, while Xieji, securities houses, and retail investors absorbed the sell-off, sending the price soaring by 400 yuan to a high of 20,700 yuan. Seeing another securities house dumping on behalf of Tianjin gangs, and amid negative rumors, many parties began to dump their holdings, causing the price to plummet by 1,050 yuan to 19,650 yuan. The yarn and flower gangs advanced sharply, and with retailers actively supporting the market, the price rose by 850 yuan to 25,000 yuan. However, the control of cotton yarn led to a sharp decline, and the market became weak again. Securities houses, flower shops, Ming Feng, Sheng Yuan Yong, Xiang Xing Yong, and Tianjin gangs sold wildly, with many parties concentrating their sales, causing the price to plummet by 2,900 yuan. At noon, it retreated to a low of 17,600 yuan. A certain securities house advanced with floating positions and ultimately saw a rise of 350 yuan, closing at noon at 17,950 yuan, up 350 yuan from the noon close before the holiday (the 11th), and 2,450 yuan lower than the off-market price on the previous day. After the close, it rose to 18,300 yuan, then 18,100 yuan. There was a fluctuation of 3,100 yuan in the first half of the day, with little trading volume. Gold ornaments in silver shops and peer shops fell by 200 yuan per tael, from 2,100 yuan to 1,900 yuan (the purchase price was reduced by 200 yuan). Silver was listed at 20 yuan, and the black market price had risen to 21.2 yuan. Silver coins were 11.2 yuan each.

Yesterday's foreign currency market, after rising, retreated slightly. Both British pounds and U.S. dollars were 410 yuan. U.S. dollar notes rose to 21 yuan and finally settled at 20 yuan. Hong Kong notes rose to 3 yuan and 5 fen, with larger notes down 5 fen. Military notes rose as high as 7 yuan and 5 jiao, and finally settled at 6 yuan and 8 jiao.

### Food Panic Is Truly Unbearable

The black market for national rice is becoming increasingly chaotic. There is a move to prohibit entry into the concession today, which has made people even more uneasy. Vendors and those holding goods are stirring up trouble, raising prices at will. Early in the market, calls reached as high as 600 yuan per stone, while there were also prices of 500 yuan and several tens of yuan, varying depending on the distance. Prices are higher in the Public Concession. The panic over people's livelihood reached its peak yesterday. Thinking of the hardship, the sole purpose is to seek food and survive, and everyone is rushing to buy japonica rice, not buying glutinous rice, buying soybeans, adzuki beans, corn, and sorghum, without any satisfaction. People are crowded together, and adzuki beans have also risen to 2 yuan and 4 jiao per catty, which is usually only 1 yuan and 6 or 7 jiao. There are indeed many people carrying national rice on the streets. Unfortunately, those whose loads exceed the limit are confiscated, and the number of confiscated loads, including the rice carried by the citizens themselves, is alarming and pitiful. Even at dusk, there were still many rice vendors on the streets, and prices had fallen below 50 yuan. There were also rumors that the market would immediately plummet, all because the rice had nowhere to go and had to be sold cheaply. However, few people were interested, so it was a little over ten yuan lower than the previous day. Southbound late rice opened at 340 yuan, 330 yuan, and then 320 yuan. Kunshan North Japonica was 395 yuan. However, rice shops were not selling rice, and selling prices were far above that, still not available for less than 5 or 60 yuan. Therefore, the profits earned by various grain stores in the past two days are enough to compensate for seven years of work.

### Fortunate Ones Among Merchants

The recent market volatility has been good for a few types of businesses. First, military notes that were previously around 4 yuan are now selling for around 7 yuan, and the profits are considerable. In addition, the reserve notes, which were previously at par, are now being sold at a premium of 20-30% on the market. There are still two or three batches of people lined up in front, and you have to arrive early just to get in line. How can profits not be high? Secondly, food, whether it is rice, corn, sorghum, beans, or wheat, as long as it can alleviate hunger, the price of national rice has risen from 320-330 yuan per stone to 600 yuan in two days, which is 40 times higher than before the war, a rise of 260-270 yuan in two days. Where can you find such a business? It's just that the corn reserves are too small and the weevil damage is too serious, so it can only be temporarily prohibited, and you can't eat good rice. The result is that adzuki beans are flying high at over 2 yuan a catty. Sorghum flour also sells for 1.8 or 9 yuan, and even mixed with bran sells for 1.6 yuan. Cut noodles are over 2 yuan per unit, and you still have to stand in line to wait. Thirdly, stores selling foreign powder, cooking oil, and cigarette paper benefit. Military notes rise every day, and the price of goods rises step by step. The amount of money grows more and more every day, how can you not be happy? This has also led to a surge in daily necessities. Soap and matches are all good, and prices are soaring. A box of Lao Pai Gu Ben soap that used to cost 5 or 6 yuan now costs 220 yuan and there are still people who want it. The most hateful thing is that it is inconvenient to speculate on cotton yarn, so they are desperately raising the price of cloth, which is now three or four times more expensive than silk. A cloth long gown costs over a hundred silver dollars. Trying to stop stealing chickens is like the chicken is still there, and prices are rising like spring breezes. Life is just like flipping over. It's terrible to be making wedding clothes for others, and the calculations don't add up.

### There May Be Solutions for Soybean Oil; Miscellaneous Grains Soar Unabated

With miscellaneous grains soaring, those holding bran seize the opportunity to raise prices, causing market prices to skyrocket. Sanxin large-bag bran even opened at a staggering 1,034 yuan. Rumors of hoarding and unloading then arose, causing a sudden drop to 95.5 yuan, and small bags to 96 yuan.

Qingdao unrefined oil, over two thousand barrels have arrived, together with the previous shipments, totaling more than four thousand barrels, amounting to one thousand three hundred tons. The oil industry wholesale office plans to allocate them within three or four days, which may temporarily alleviate the oil shortage.

Yang Heqing of the grain industry says that there are already considerable solutions for the sources of cooking oil and soybeans. Rice and corn still require instructions from the Changju (Municipal Government). The newly organized Shanghai Cooperative Business Office for Adjusting Civil Food, Rice, Wheat, and Miscellaneous Grains has also joined the Miscellaneous Grains Association as a special member, hoping to jointly concentrate efforts to solve the current difficulties.

Spring and Autumn

### Reaffirming "Focus on Hygiene"

— Zhi Cang

The way of hygiene is no longer a fashionable matter; however, we admit that we still need to live, so we have to talk about "hygiene," which is just like the five grains or even six grains, indispensable for a day. A group of refined gentlemen understand science, and their research into the way of hygiene starts with nutrition. For example, a person needs a certain amount of vitamins A, B, C, D every day, each with its due mission: if you don't eat cod liver oil, you will suffer from dry eye syndrome and rickets; if you don't eat beans or hygienic rice, you will get beriberi; if you can't buy Florida oranges, you will get scurvy and even endocrine atrophy; if you can't get "A" grade milk, you will suffer from neurasthenia, etc. Opening the encyclopedia of hygiene will reveal the same conclusions, and you can't help but applaud in amazement.

However, in this world that specializes in the way of hygiene, there will always be a group of "anti-hygienists" who are strangely pale and emaciated. What is the reason for this? Is it that the people can be made to follow, but not to know, without any basic hygiene knowledge? No, no, in the current world, to ask for a piece of tofu that slightly meets the nutritional standards (with protein and calcium) is about the price of meat, let alone the magnificent cod liver oil, Florida oranges, and "A" grade milk. Paying attention to the nutritional value of hygiene is certainly positive, but in short, lacking vitamin M, it is something that can only be hoped for but not achieved. So, let's talk about spiritual hygiene. In the early morning, before getting on the carriage to go to the streets, go to the park and laugh three times, or practice Tai Chi and feel it, but it is said to be a bit wasteful and harmful, the more you laugh, the more you won't have constipation or stomach problems.

That is truly pitiful and somewhat laughable. But spending all day frowning and being mentally depressed is not the way to live. Mozi said: "Those who rely on their strength live, those who do not rely on their strength do not live." A soft and weak appearance may save some "calories" on a person, but the activity of the power of survival will disappear. Eating less and worrying about things will definitely lead to elimination, so why bother.

Starting from lying lazily in bed and skipping breakfast, everything can be stopped. The floor is not swept, the table is not wiped, the children cry in the pile of urine, the rats can fight with the cats, and the room is filled with dust and foul air. Garbage is enough to relieve hunger, leaking rain doesn't matter, it can be used as a substitute for tea. Where does this kind of spiritual hygiene come from?

Mencius said: "I am good at nourishing my vast and upright spirit." Now it is difficult to eat, and it is not easy to eat six-grain flour; but for the sake of our lives, we have to talk about hygiene. Vitamins are hard to come by, and for the poor, hygiene is even more essential, which is definitely not the same as doing things perfunctorily. Born in sorrow, die in ease, is ultimately not a deceptive saying. As the weather gets warmer, pay extra attention to both household and public hygiene. Once there is illness, seeking medicine is truly a waste of money and effort.

### Stage and Screen

The Russian song and dance troupe that performed at the Great Light Theater on the 6th of this month achieved satisfactory results, and the Asia Theater is quite pleased. At a time when the first-run movies are replaying old films, it is not a joy to have a stage performance with excellent attendance? Therefore, on the 20th and 21st of this month, performances will continue. Ticket prices remain the same, and it is heard that reservations can be made in advance at the Great Light.

Lu Luming is paid 1,000 yuan for performing "Song of Rejuvenation" at the Ruby, while Liu Qiong, Xia Xia, Tu Guangqi, Sima Yingcai, etc., receive only three yuan per performance at the Carlton. However, the actors performing "Compromising for Survival" at Zhang Garden receive nothing, not even transportation fees, which can be said to be truly "sacrificing for the sake of art."

According to a certain prophet's "prediction": Wang Xichun will end his film career this year.

### Sharing the Same Boat in Storms

— He Jia Zhi

(2) Sorrow and Joy

Huang Shifu handed the water pipe to his rickshaw puller and laughed: "Brother Weicheng, your mother's illness is extremely weak. And I heard that she received injections from a Western doctor, which makes me unsure. Now I have tentatively drafted this prescription. If you trust me, try a dose and see. Life and death depend on this. Otherwise, please invite some more skilled doctors from the countryside..." As he said this, he cupped his hands and walked out. At the door, he added, "The medicine from Liangxintang is good, other places won't do. Take forty or fifty yuan with you." Li Youxie and Weicheng escorted Huang Shifu to the gate, watching him get into the rickshaw and rattling away.

Back inside, Second Madam Ye was already taking out money, instructing Axing to go to Liangxintang in Huagang to get the medicine. Weicheng said, "Listening to him, the hope seems very small. I think Western doctor Lin's effect may be faster than traditional Chinese medicine." Li Youxie said, "Weicheng, you must not be indecisive again. Huang Shifu is the famous Huang the Madman. He is a family doctor; his father was the old madman, and he is the young madman. Now the young madman is also old. When he was young, he read medical books day and night. When people asked him to see a doctor, he would sit in the boat and continue reading his medical books; he didn't care when he passed through Huagang City River. Once, a family had a sudden illness and went to his house to ask for help. He had already gone out to see a patient. Later, his boat passed through Huagang City River on the way home. The person who asked for the doctor knew that it was midnight, so Huang the Madman would definitely not be willing to come ashore to see a patient. So, he carried two buckets of manure and placed them on the bridge, saying: Mr. Huang, if you don't come up to see a patient, I will pour the manure down. Huang the Madman had no choice but to come ashore and wrote a prescription, with only thirty-five small coins worth of medicine, and the illness was cured. Where would he need forty or fifty yuan? Now, things are really different than before." (22)
