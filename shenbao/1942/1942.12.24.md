### Strenuously Practice Consumption Economy

Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the import of materials has become increasingly difficult. In addition to vigorously increasing domestic production on the positive side to enrich supply, on the negative side, we should particularly strive to practice consumption economy to reduce the consumption of materials. Moreover, economical consumption is something everyone can do. If it can be earnestly implemented, there will be considerable results.

However, to vigorously practice consumption economy, we must start from many aspects and promote it universally. In particular, governments at all levels must use mandatory or semi-mandatory methods to achieve practical results. The "Economy" commentary on the 20th of this month has already explained its significance. Now, the following points that can be saved at present are listed as follows:

1.  Administrative Organs

(1)  Abolish and merge redundant organs. All organs with the same or similar work nature should be abolished and merged immediately; and the funds and personnel of the abolished organs should be transferred to productive enterprises in a planned manner.

(2)  Restrict the establishment of new organs and the expansion of old organs. Except for work that is directly related to production and construction and must be urgently carried out, and cannot be handled without establishing another organ, it shall be an exception.

(3)  Minimize meetings. Holding meetings consumes a lot of manpower and resources, so except for necessary meetings, they should be minimized.

(4)  Vigorously implement a centralized purchasing system. If various organs purchase stationery, paper, and other items separately, it will not only easily breed malpractices, but the prices will also inevitably be more expensive; a centralized purchasing system should be adopted to facilitate supervision. In addition, bidding and standard product customization methods should be adopted to seek economy and prevent malpractices.

(5)  Reduce unnecessary construction and repairs. During this extraordinary period, office and accommodation buildings should be simple and rough, and used reluctantly as a principle.

(6)  Reduce unnecessary inspections. The dispatch of inspections by various organs, except for necessary ones, should be minimized to save the travel expenses of the organ and the entertainment expenses of various localities.

(7)  Reduce fuel and electricity consumption. Various organs should promote washing faces with cold water to save fuel; electric lights should be turned off at any time when not needed, and a time should be set to turn off the main switch to save electricity consumption.

(8)  Absolutely prohibit organs from entertaining guests. Except for diplomatic envoys' international receptions, banquets between organs internally and externally should be absolutely prohibited.

(9)  Reduce official document procedures and content. The current general official document procedures and content are often too complicated; there are those that do not need to be universally circulated but are universally distributed, those where the same official document is forwarded by several higher-level organs to the same lower-level organs, those where the beginning and end of a matter can be described in a few words, but are described in lengthy and verbose terms, those with very short main texts, which are turned into extremely lengthy ones by adding forwarding clichés, and those with too many columns in official document paper, leaving large blank spaces. All of these are a waste of manpower and resources, and should be minimized by the responsible personnel, and public announcements or other simple methods should be used to reduce official document procedures.

(10) Reduce laborers. The number of laborers used by various organs should be limited to the minimum necessary. In addition, officials should be prevented from using public laborers to handle and send private matters and letters in place, to save expenses.

2.  Business Organs

(1)  Vigorously implement a business budget system. To reduce and exempt arbitrary expansion of expenditures, a business budget system should be established.

(2)  Vigorously implement a standard cost system. The production cost of each industry should be based on the proportion of various production costs of domestic production organs of the same type with more economical operation, and an appropriate ratio should be established as a standard.

(3)  Reasonable allocation of production factors. The supply and demand of various production factors, such as machinery and equipment, raw materials, technical talents, and skilled workers, must be reasonably matched, and no one factor should be allowed to be surplus or insufficient, so as to avoid various production factors not being fully utilized at the same time.

(4)  Determine the ratio of the number of management departments to technical departments. Technical work must have reasonable management work to improve efficiency; however, management personnel should be based on the principle of being able to fully utilize technology. If the number of people is too large, it is also a waste. Therefore, the ratio of the number of the two should be determined based on actual needs. In addition, the above-mentioned items that administrative organs should save can also be applied.

Some of the above-mentioned items require the government to implement special projects, some require the government to detail specific plans and list them as administrative measures, and some require various organs to automatically organize economy committees to supervise and vigorously implement them. In short, they must be implemented effectively to achieve considerable results.

Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency) - At the dinner party to welcome President Wang and concurrently President of the Executive Yuan of the National Government, Prime Minister Tojo of Japan gave a speech, the general idea of which was: "Your Excellency President Wang visited our country in June last year. At this time, when the world is cold and tense, and there are many internal and external affairs, you have taken the time to visit us again despite your hard work. I am very happy and inspired to see that Your Excellency President Wang is as healthy and radiant as ever. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, more than a year has passed. At the beginning of the war, the National Government of the Republic of China expressed its determination to share weal and woe with Japan. Since then, it has been based on this determination to fully cooperate with Japan, launch a new national movement, and actively promote all construction. We are deeply grateful for this. In the first year of the war under the Emperor's majesty, Japan has achieved great results that are known to the world, and has established a superior situation. It has also obtained important resources that can be used immediately from Britain and the United States, laying the foundation for certain victory, and also building a solid foundation for a new Greater East Asia where all countries can get what they want and all people can share peace and happiness. At the same time, the Republic of China and other allied countries in the Greater East Asia are also fully and happily cooperating with Japan to achieve this common goal, so the future of the Greater East Asia is showing infinite light. The mission of the countries in East Asia in the future, as President Wang has pointed out, must be to work together with the determination to share weal and woe, strengthen this foundation for certain victory, expand war power, and fiercely attack Britain and the United States to the end, until they are subdued. This time, I have had a full exchange of views with President Wang, which has deepened the bond between comrades in China and Japan and strengthened the relationship of cooperation. It is truly suitable for the times and worthy of celebration. Here, I would like to express my deep gratitude for the trouble that President Wang and everyone has taken, and I hope that China and Japan will cooperate closely to achieve our common goal."

Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency) - President Wang said the following in his reply speech at the welcome banquet: "Since my arrival in Tokyo, I have been grateful to Prime Minister Tojo for taking the time out of his busy military affairs to openly and frankly exchange important opinions on the current situation. Tonight, I am honored to have a grand banquet specially prepared for me, and to be able to gather with the ministers and celebrities from all walks of life, and to listen to your sincere speech. I and my colleagues are very grateful. Just now, Prime Minister Tojo specially mentioned my previous visit in June last year. The warm feelings and kindness that the government and people of your country extended to me at that time are still vivid in my memory. This time I have come again, and the warm feelings and kindness have increased. Especially the enlightenment on the current situation has added infinite courage to my gratitude. This is really not something that can be expressed in gratitude. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the bravery of your country's army and navy and the diligence of the entire nation have been invincible, and they have wiped out the maritime power and bases of Britain and the United States in the East Pacific and South Seas. This unprecedented great achievement has added unparalleled glory to the East Asian nation and laid the foundation for the coexistence and co-prosperity of the East Asian situation. I am honored to be able to personally express my admiration and gratitude to the government authorities of your country tonight. Prime Minister Tojo is burdened with the great task of leading the Greater East Asia War, and he has built this great achievement with his wisdom and courage. I am honored to be able to personally pay my respects tonight, and to see that you are in good health and strong spirit despite dealing with important military and national affairs day and night, which is even more than when we met here in June last year. I am especially pleased. I and the colleagues of the National Government have always believed that we have the intention to share weal and woe, but we are afraid that we will not be able to contribute to the Greater East Asia War. Therefore, we urge ourselves day and night. What Prime Minister Tojo said just now, that the East Asian nations must unite and eliminate the means of instigation and the effects of anaesthesia used by Britain and the United States in the past, restore the original appearance of the East Asian nations loving each other, seek future prosperity with the current suffering, so the final victory of the Greater East Asia War lies in this, and the successful foundation of the Greater East Asia construction also lies in this. I am not talented, but I and the colleagues of the National Government and all the people will work hard to follow in the footsteps of the advanced countries and exhaust all our efforts to share a part of the responsibility. I would like to use the host's wine glass to wish Prime Minister Tojo and all the ministers and celebrities good health, and to wish the Greater East Asia War victory and the Greater East Asia construction success."

He returned here from Paris yesterday and reported to the government. He told reporters that the conference was the beginning of further cooperation between the three countries. The chaotic situation caused by the treason of Darlan and others will also be clarified as a result. France's main future strategy lies in fighting Bolshevism and continuing to cooperate closely with Germany and Italy.

Vichy, 23rd (Havas News Agency) - After returning here from Paris today, government leader Laval went to the Parc Hotel and had a long talk with Head of State Petain.

The Axis powers' determination for final victory is the basic principle of this meeting, so the issue discussed was how to strive for final victory. In addition to the important nature of the meeting, military experts from Germany and Italy also held small group meetings. Both sides were in complete agreement on the issues under consideration. Subsequently, Germany's war against the Soviet Union will become the main strategy of the Axis powers' war. At the same time, the war in the Mediterranean is an important war for Germany and Italy to deal with a common enemy, so the wars in the two places cannot be divided into two. Therefore, there must be a common plan to make a final effort. German responsible officials further assured that military initiative will always be in the hands of the Axis powers. Regarding the issues discussed by French government leader Laval at the German Head of State's headquarters on the weekend, the German Foreign Ministry spokesman said last night that the talks discussed issues related to France, because Laval hoped to cooperate more closely with the Axis powers.

Berlin, 23rd (Havas News Agency) - According to German sources, details of the meeting between German Head of State Hitler, French government leader Laval, and Italian Foreign Minister Ciano are supplemented as follows: Foreign Minister Ciano arrived at the location of Head of State Hitler's headquarters at noon on the 18th of this month, accompanied by Chief of Staff Cavallero.

### German Army on the Eastern Front Flexible Strategy Breaks Soviet Counter-Offensive Plan

Berlin, 23rd (Reuters News Agency) - People here believe that the situation on the Eastern Front is very satisfactory. The flexible strategy of the German army in the areas of Chiff, Kalinin, Voronezh, Stalingrad, and the Don River has achieved great success. In the middle of the Don River, the Soviet army attacked on a front of 560 kilometers wide, and was strongly resisted by the German and Italian armies everywhere. In the past few days, after the Soviet army made slight advances, it planned to continue its large-scale offensive to the southwest, but has not made any progress. The German air force continues to operate in bad weather, so the Soviet tanks are more cautious in their movements than before, and they only move in the most important places, presumably because of heavy losses. The climate this winter is milder than last winter, and the German army is very well prepared, so the Soviet army's experience this year is not as good as last winter. Therefore, German soldiers are very confident in the future situation.

### A Tour of the Forefront in North China (Dialogue Meeting) (3)

— Representative of the House of Representatives, Kunitoshi Tsuyun; Secretary-General of the House of Representatives, Misao Oki

Translated from the December issue of "Modern Times," 31st Year of the Republic: The Real Situation of Industrial Warriors in North China

Reporter: What is the state of security in the locations of these important resources?

Tsuyun: Not all of them are in areas where security has been restored. Many are in so-called enemy areas or bandit areas. In this environment, a small number of troops protect the technicians and other industrial warriors who are deeply involved in resource development.

Oki: The director of the Longyan Iron Mine, Mr. Masukazu Yamagiwa, is a very enthusiastic person. When I met him, he was practically weeping as he spoke. He is completely devoted to developing resources for Japan. There is a well-known story about Mr. Yamagiwa. A railway branch line has been opened from Xuanhua to a point forty or fifty kilometers inland, with freight cars traveling back and forth. From there to the current excavation site, there is a motor road. This road is built along a perilous cliff, and only one freight car can barely pass through it. Furthermore, it is a winding mountain road, and if the driver is not careful, there is a danger of falling into a valley thousands of feet deep. It is said that this difficult project was completed with the cooperation of nearby villagers. Initially, Mr. Yamagiwa had asked a certain Japanese construction company for a contracted estimate, and it was said to be tens of thousands of yen. So he decided to enlist the nearby villagers to excavate the road. As a result, it was successfully excavated for only a quarter of the price estimated by the construction company. The villagers not only helped with the excavation of the road, but they are also still carrying timber and various materials for development on horseback. Of course, they receive compensation, but I personally saw the local residents sincerely trusting and cooperating with Japan.

Oki: There are more than 500 workers in this mine who have defected from the Communist army. Their performance is said to be very good.

Tsuyun: That is because they are being used effectively.

Oki: Ultimately, isn't that the reason? They all seem to be motivated by enthusiasm.

Tsuyun: When Director Yamagiwa and his party came to the station to welcome Chairman Okada and Mr. Oki, I also got off the train and exchanged greetings with him. When we parted, Mr. Yamagiwa said to me with a serious expression: "We will take care of everything on the front lines. Please take responsibility for the work in the rear." His attitude was sincere and his voice was trembling. The people who were welcoming us were crying. The group being welcomed was also crying. It was truly a moving scene.

Reporter: This moving scene must be the reality of the front lines.

Oki: It should be said that it is a powerful expression, or it signifies a brilliant future, and it is deeply appreciated.

Tsuyun: I once passed through a place called Ningwu in Shanxi Province, which is one of the largest timber distribution centers in North China. The timber producing area is in the nearby bandit area. The Japanese engaged in timber harvesting and loading are frequently attacked by bandits, and the number of victims is quite large. But no matter what, despite being attacked and sacrificing their lives, the Japanese recognize that timber is absolutely necessary for the construction of North China, so they continue to fight on tenaciously. If someone is attacked today, another person will take their place tomorrow, and they continue to work without stopping for a day. Recently, it seems that even the bandits themselves have admitted defeat, and the number of attacks has gradually decreased. Even though it is in the middle of a bandit area, everyone is unconcerned and engages in timber harvesting. In short, the industrial warriors on the front lines are risking their lives to assist in the war effort and working hard for the country. In this sense, they can be said to be no different from the military. If everyone could respond with the spirit of the industrial warriors working on the front lines, there would be no problem.

Oki: I completely agree.

### Speculative Merchants Stir Up Trouble; Legal Sanctions to Be Imposed; Illegally Trading and Exploiting Public Interests; Police Are Extremely Cautious in Eradicating the Black Market

The English-language China Press reported that a senior official of the Shanghai Municipal Police stated to a reporter yesterday (the 22nd) that the black market in Shanghai is now rapidly collapsing and will soon be eradicated. The Municipal Authorities investigation into the illegal market is nearing completion, and final steps will soon be taken to clean up the chaos created by speculative elements in the commodity market in recent months.

Speculative Brokers Will Soon Be Tried

The Legal Department and the Commodities Control Section of the Municipal Council are working closely together to collect evidence of crimes committed by speculative manipulators in the market. The Police Department is actively investigating recent activities in the cotton market, as exemplified by the several arrests of cotton market speculators over the past three months. The police initially made arrests to warn those in the cotton market not to continue their clandestine activities, lest they be punished. They then issued another warning. As those in the cotton market continued to engage in illegal transactions, it became necessary to make further arrests. The police are conducting a deeper investigation into each of the brokers and speculators who have been detained or warned. Therefore, at least ten brokers are summoned by the police for questioning every day. Once the investigation is completed, 364 brokers will be summoned to court for trial.

Black Market Transactions Subject to Legal Sanctions

The difficulty encountered by the police is that they must investigate each of these brokers one by one and collect irrefutable evidence, which is time-consuming. In order to achieve this goal, the police have repeatedly consulted with the Legal Department, and recently filed a lawsuit against twelve brokers in the Special First District Court for engaging in black market transactions, which has been won. Therefore, the Legal Department now has the confidence that once a lawsuit is filed with the court, it will be successful. Although the police have been investigating brokers' activities for a long time, it was not until the most recent arrest of 364 brokers two weeks ago that the necessary evidence was obtained, enabling them to devote themselves to the final investigation. The police officer continued that the authorities will be able to achieve final victory in cracking down on the black market and preventing illegal transactions.

No Effort Spared to Eradicate the Black Market

The police are well aware that many people in Shanghai are still violating the regulations of the Commodities Control Section. However, the authorities are conducting the investigation extremely cautiously, and will spare no effort in eradicating the black market. Therefore, violators will soon be caught in the net of the law. Brokers are closely related to the high prices of goods. Raising prices is, of course, the fault of speculators, but speculators can only exploit the public with the help of brokers. For the sake of their own interests and the interests of the cargo owners, brokers do not hesitate to stir up trouble and demand the highest prices in order to sell various goods, leading to chaotic phenomena in the market.

### Minister Tajiri Returned to His Country Yesterday

According to the English-language China Press, Mr. Tajiri, the Minister in charge of the Shanghai Embassy Office, left Shanghai for Tokyo yesterday (the 22nd) to report on the situation in Shanghai to the central authorities. He was accompanied by Mr. Sone, the third section chief of the General Affairs Department of the Shanghai Embassy Office. In addition, according to a Domei News Agency report from this port, Mr. Ta, Counselor of the Japanese Embassy, has been appointed as the head of the Economic Section of the Shanghai Japanese Embassy Office.

### Japanese Military Authorities Express Satisfaction with the Second Air Defense Drill in This City; Significant Progress in Light Control; Hope That Citizens Will Cooperate to Achieve Perfection

According to a Domei News Agency report from this port, the Japanese Army and Navy Air Defense Headquarters issued a statement last night expressing satisfaction with the attitude of the residents in implementing air raid precautions during the second air defense drill held in this city over the past ten days. At the same time, it emphasized the importance and necessity of stepping up vigilance during the Greater East Asia War, and urged citizens to cooperate to perfect passive air defense measures. The statement criticized the matter of light control, stating that there has been significant progress in this area since the first light control drill held more than two months ago. However, some citizens do not understand the true intentions of the authorities, and either turn off all the lights to avoid the trouble of concealing them, or do not conceal them properly, which is improper. Regarding traffic control during air defense drills, although it is difficult to implement effective control in congested areas, it is generally quite smooth. Further attention should be paid to this in the future. As for fire fighting, poison gas prevention, and first aid drills, great improvements have been seen, which proves the effectiveness of continuing passive air defense measures. In addition, all households must understand the danger of incendiary bombs and poison gas, and act quickly and calmly in an emergency in order to minimize casualties and damage from air raids. Chinese residents should pay particular attention to this point. In general, the response to air raid sirens has been quite good. Only a few locations lack the necessary preparations and the communication methods are inadequate, which should be remedied.

### Selling White Paper; Obtaining Money by Fraud; Marrying a Dancer with the Proceeds; Husband and Wife Arrested After the Case Was Discovered

Zhang Jingshan of Wantong Trading Company at No. 170 West Road recently intended to purchase a large quantity of white paper. Chen Zudao of Gongyuan Paper Company on Jingyuan Street, Guangdong Road, introduced him to Gui Wenqu, a native of Zhejiang. Gui is currently the manager of a certain newspaper office on the second floor of the Hardoon Building on Nanjing Road. He claimed to have a large quantity of paper for sale. Chen, Zhang, and others negotiated at the Jinmen Hotel and agreed on a total of 2,500 reams of paper at 205 yuan per ream, totaling 512,500 yuan. They agreed that half of the paper would be delivered on the 10th of this month, and the remainder would be cleared by the 20th. Zhang then gave Gui a check for 135,000 yuan. Chen Zudao himself also ordered 200 reams of paper from Gui Wenqu and paid a deposit of 19,800 yuan with a check. At the same time, Gui also took out a receipt for 200,000 yuan that he had paid to a certain Japanese firm to show that he had already ordered goods in advance. However, all of Gui's actions were deceiving. After cashing the deposit, he married a Cantonese woman surnamed Feng (only eighteen years old) at the Xin Xianlin Dance Hall on the 4th of this month and lived with her at No. 26, Lane 280, Rue Saussay in the French Concession. By the 10th, Gui had no goods to deliver. After repeated inquiries by Zhang and Chen, he delivered 180 reams of white paper on the 19th to stall for time. After that, there was no further news, and they realized they had been deceived. They reported to the Xinza Gate Police Station the day before yesterday, and detective Song Shaomei was dispatched to arrest Gui Wenqu and his wife Gui Feng and take them to the police station, where they were detained separately. They were sent to the Special First District Court yesterday morning. In addition to explaining the case, the police stated that the defendant admitted that 101,800 yuan had been given to Shen Bingguang, another 13,000 yuan was deposited in a certain newspaper office, and the remaining funds had been used for wedding expenses and the purchase of clothing. As further investigation is still needed, they requested detention. The court ordered the two defendants to be detained pending a later hearing.

### Various Banks and Financial Institutions Handle Year-End Closing of Accounts; Commercial and Other Departments Have Completed Settlement; All Industries Will Be Able to Pass This Year-End

Various banks and financial institutions are handling the year-end closing of accounts and have issued notices to their respective departments to rush to complete settlement matters. (1) The Savings Department has completely completed interest calculation on the 20th and notified the depositors of the settlement list separately for verification. (2) The Commercial Department is approved to handle interest calculation starting tomorrow. After the interest calculation of each department is completed, the accounting department will handle the general closing of accounts. Therefore, the banks have been very busy internally closing accounts these days. In order to maintain their inherent credit, all industries are adjusting their positions and trying to clear all borrowings from the banks before the closing period, such as overdrafts. Therefore, during this closing period, the collection and remittance of funds by various financial institutions is doubly busy, the amount of bill exchange has increased, the market foreign exchange has increased, and the credit is tighter than usual. However, the Central Reserve Bank and the joint reserve mechanism of financial institutions, in order to regulate finance and stabilize the market, handle the lending to peer institutions as much as possible according to the legitimate needs of each institution's business, so the financial situation is stable, and all industries can safely pass this year-end closing period. It is also heard that it has been decided to take a four-day holiday from January 1st to 4th of next year, plus Sunday, and the market will open on the 5th.

### Wholesale Oil Depot Announces Preparation for Rationing Oil by Head; Stipulates Measures for Government Employees to Purchase Oil; Strictly Supervising the Rotation Sales of Each Store

The Shanghai Edible Oil Industry Wholesale Depot announced to registered retailers in preparation for implementing oil rationing by head, stating, "To whom it may concern, in order to universally supply edible oil, adapt to the environment, and benefit the needs of citizens, the method of oil rationing by head has been submitted to the military distribution authorities for review, and everything is in progress. All existing registered members of this depot will naturally no longer be applicable when oil rationing by head is implemented in the future, and everything must be cancelled. However, the current situation should be temporarily maintained. As for the retail stores for oil rationing by head at the time of implementation, they should be in suitable locations, have considerable equipment, and must have the ability to pay thirty to fifty dan of oil money and deposit a guarantee deposit at one time. Members who intend to undertake oil rationing matters are requested to fill out the attached application form in duplicate within five days of receiving this letter and send it to this depot for submission to the authorities for review. This is hereby notified for your information."

Strictly Supervise Rotation Sales

After the wholesale depot merged the city's 1,830 registered retailers into two groups, A and B, it was recently decided that group A would have 81 groups and group B would have 115 groups. Each group is composed of more than ten retailers. (1) Group A has been selling since the 22nd and will end tomorrow. (2) Group B is allowed to start selling the day after tomorrow and will end on the 29th, and is ordered to sell all the ten-day oil supply within the time limit. As for the profits from the sale of oil by the retailers in each group A and B, they will be distributed equally among the merged retail stores, and the sales will be handled in rotation to ensure fairness.

Stipulate Measures to Prevent Abuses

The supervising staff for the sale of edible oil by each retail store stipulated two principles: (1) They must arrive at each designated retail store before 8:00 a.m. (2) First, weigh all the edible oil in each retail store to see if the number of oils received matches. The quantity of edible oil sold is stipulated as one catty and half a catty, and the price is handled according to the limited price. A reporter from the Shanghai News learned from the wholesale depot yesterday that it is determined according to the number of buyers and the oil situation, and the purpose is to universally supply and facilitate the store to cope with it. The supervising staff of each retail store authorized by the licensing authority will decide it at any time in accordance with the above regulations.

Measures for Government Employees to Purchase Oil

The wholesale depot has decided on the measures for government employees to purchase oil. The depot will issue "Special Oil Purchase Certificates," stating "Present this certificate to purchase one catty of edible oil from the edible oil retail store registered with this depot. The retail store must collect this certificate and submit it to this depot for reimbursement." However, government employees who want to receive oil must provide a letter of proof from the original agency, which will be issued according to the number of government employees, with one certificate per person as the principle. After the oil purchase certificate is issued, they may no longer request the retail oil store to accommodate free purchase.

### Hengfeng Yarn Factory Military Control Lifted; Jointly Operated by Chinese and Japanese Merchants

The Hengfeng Yarn Factory was placed under military control after the Sino-Japanese War. It was not until the Double Tenth Festival this year that it was returned by the authorities. After the factory was released from military control, it consulted with the Dai Nippon Spinning Company, which was originally entrusted with its management, on cooperation. As a result, both parties agreed to each invest 2.5 million yuan, totaling 5 million yuan, to reorganize it into a Chinese-Japanese joint venture yarn factory. The president is Genkichi Kotera (president of Dai Nippon Spinning Company), and the vice president is Lu Sheng Nie (original manager of the hand yarn factory). It is reported that the factory has 54,544 spindles and 614 looms, and the equipment is quite complete.

### Department Stores Offer 4,000 Types of Goods at Fixed Prices; Authorities Urge Public Cooperation to Control Prices; Focus on Production, Limit Purchases to Practical Items

The Shanghai Department Store Association submitted a request to the Public Works Department on September 29th of this year, seeking approval for fixed retail prices for 10,000 types of goods. The authorities have completed reviewing 4,123 of these items. The fixed prices for these 4,000-plus items will be announced soon. It is reported that the prices will be approximately 30% higher than the market prices at the end of May.

Urging Citizens to Cooperate in Suppressing Prices

The authorities of the two concessions have issued a public announcement regarding price controls, stating: "In order to stabilize prices and ensure the people's livelihood, we urge the public to cooperate. While the authorities can take measures to control prices, this requires the cooperation and understanding of the public to be effective. The harms of high prices are well-known to the public. If the rising trend of prices is not curbed, it will not only cause great difficulties for the working class but also shake the economic foundation of the city. Whenever prices rise beyond the affordability of the working class, the repercussions are obvious. Therefore, if the rise in prices is not curbed, it will invariably become the mother of social unrest. The true key to studying economic problems lies in the purchasing power of money. Therefore, our actions must be judged by whether they increase or decrease the purchasing power of money. When prices rise, the purchasing power of money decreases."

Focus on Production, Avoid Hoarding

"For example, if a person has 1,000 yuan to buy goods, and the price doubles, their money also doubles to 2,000 yuan. However, the purchasing power of the 2,000 yuan is equal to or even less than the original 1,000 yuan. On the part of the authorities, they are currently planning various methods, such as credit loans limited to production businesses and encouraging essential industries, to improve the situation. On the part of the public, the following measures can be implemented to cooperate: (1) Focus on the operation of production businesses; (2) Individuals should only purchase essential practical items; (3) Do not hoard any goods; (4) Instead of engaging in the distribution of finished products, focus on investing in genuine production enterprises; (5) Do not engage in speculation in goods and stocks to seek exorbitant profits; (6) Carefully study various investments based on the percentage of previous dividends and profits, and do not rely on impressions and rumors. Before investing, also carefully review the company's balance sheet and profit and loss statement. If the public can implement the above measures, not only will the rise in prices be curbed, but also the assets they already possess and will acquire in the future will be protected."

### Price Countermeasures Committee Adjusts Coal Prices

Public Works Department Announces New Price Limits

The English-language *North China Daily News* reported that the Japanese-language *Continental News* stated today (23rd) that after several meetings held by officials of the Price Countermeasures Committee at the Japanese Embassy office in Shanghai, which concluded yesterday (22nd), it is generally expected that coal prices in the Shanghai area will be readjusted and standardized. The average price of coal will be reduced by 10 Japanese yen per ton. The embassy office has repeatedly consulted with the North China authorities on the smoother distribution of coal and the setting of fair prices, which is expected to be officially announced soon. Officials of the Price Countermeasures Committee held their final meeting yesterday. The details of the plan they decided on have not been disclosed, but generally, it is to adjust the coal prices north and south of the Suzhou River. Some coal prices will be raised, and others will be lowered. On average, the coal price will be reduced by about 10 Japanese yen per ton.

The Public Works Department has recently issued Announcement No. 6215, stating that the maximum retail prices for coal and coal balls have been re-specified and will be implemented from the 24th of this month. Details can be found in the above announcement.

### Hongyi Master Memorial Society Established

### Use of Prohibited Radios Requires Approval

### Transporting Two or More Bolts of Woolen Fabric Requires a Large Shipping Permit

Regarding the delivery of woolen fabric in this city, it is stipulated that for deliveries under 30 yards, independent action is allowed. For one or more bolts, a small shipping permit must be obtained from the Woolen Fabric Association, which is then forwarded to the Greater China Woolen Textile Industry Production and Sales Association. For two or more bolts, a large shipping permit must be obtained from the above two associations, which is then submitted to the Asia Development Board for approval before transport. Otherwise, there is a risk of being inspected, fined, and confiscated on the road. Recently, all sales and deliveries of woolen fabric must have a large shipping permit to pass through, because small shipping permits are now blocked. By order of the authorities, the issuance of small shipping permits has been temporarily suspended because a certain company misused small shipping permits, delivering goods seven or eight times. After being discovered by the authorities, a strict investigation was conducted, and it was stipulated that all deliveries of woolen fabric must have a large shipping permit.

### Readers of This Newspaper Sympathize with the Poverty Relief Movement

This newspaper initiated a small fundraising campaign of 100,000 yuan for poverty relief. Yesterday, the Four Banks Savings Society donated 10 yuan, Jueji 10 yuan, and Bei Kongzhao found and donated 5 yuan. The previous balance was 3,672 yuan, and the current balance is 3,697 yuan. In addition, Shen Fengbiao from the Continental Hotel hopes that the medical community will provide some services to the poor and sick struggling on the poverty line, so that this society can better see the spirit of mutual assistance and mutual love. Also, Chen Dehao, a senior teacher at a primary school, lost his job this semester due to the lack of funds at the primary school in Pudong, which caused it to close early. In March of this year, his family also suffered a fire. Therefore, it is difficult for a family of eight to survive on the income of a poor teacher. He earnestly hopes that readers will find a way to help. Also, Han Yougen wrote that his sister is dying of lung disease. He used to work in printing, but after losing his job, he works as a rickshaw puller. He has no savings and his income is only enough to support himself. Now his sister is seriously ill and, in the event of her death, he is penniless. He is forced to beg for help from your newspaper.

Participating in the competition: Except for the women's group, which adopts a double round-robin system, the men's A and B groups both adopt a single round-robin system. The B group is divided into four divisions to speed up the competition. The A group will start the competition first, scheduled to open at 7:00 PM next Monday (28th) at the Shanghai YMCA gymnasium. There will be three matches. The first match will be between the Bing team and the Hua Nan team, both of which are outstanding newcomers. Hua Nan has always been the leader in the B group basketball, and its strength is very strong. Their encounter will surely be exciting. The second match will be between the Yi Hai Jun team and the Tong Ren team. The fighting power of the Yi Jun soccer team is well-known, and their basketball skills are also considerable. The Tong Ren Xuan family team is a brave and good-fighting team. There will be a fierce battle between the two teams. The final match will be between the Hua Lian team and the Ju Ren team. The former has many veteran Chinese players, and the latter was the runner-up in the A group of the previous West YMCA. The strength of both sides is equal, and a slow battle is inevitable.

### Government Bonds See Slight Recovery, Market Stronger Than Before

Government bond trading saw a reduction again, but the market was relatively strong.

### From Fortune to Rising

— You Zhi

Fortune, what a popular word this is: it can really be said that "even women and children know it as auspicious." During the New Year, fortune characters are pasted on the gate, and for happy events—whether it is childbirth or a birthday celebration—the fortune character is also used. Not to mention "fortune as vast as the East Sea" and "fortune and longevity complete."

However, how many people in the world can truly understand the truth of fortune? If you ask people, what counts as being fortunate? People may laugh at you for being too stupid. Fortunate? Wearing silk and satin, eating delicacies, living in a Western-style house, riding in a car, surrounded by children and grandchildren… It seems effortless to explain. However, is this truly considered being fortunate?

No, some people live in Western-style houses as if they are in a cage. Or there are even promising young men and women buried by the hereditary aristocratic status and wealthy family property. We must recognize that no matter what, the luxury and comfort of clothing, food, housing, and transportation cannot be considered true fortune. So, what counts as true fortune? Of course, fortune is also a kind of reward. For example, if you can recognize the truth of life, it counts as extremely great fortune. Secondly, spending your whole life in a state of physical and mental pleasure, of course, without being rich or noble, also counts as fortune. Being able to continue your studies at the age when others are apprentices also counts as fortune. Such things can be considered fortune that conforms to the truth. At the same time, being scolded by others for fighting for justice can be considered an extremely glorious and valuable fortune.

In short, what is called fortune is not only comfort in spirit and action. True fortune must also be sought by oneself and recognized by oneself.

### The Sorrows of a Male Waiter

— Lu Huasheng

After reading Mr. Boxin's article, "The Words of a Female Waitress," we male waiters also need to express our pent-up grievances.

In recent years, the catering industry has been in a golden age, with cutthroat competition and endless rivalry. Exquisite decorations and renowned chefs are a given. However, the service aspect alone requires painstaking effort. In addition to hiring female waitresses, male waiters are also carefully selected. Look at the "Waiters Wanted" advertisements in the newspapers, which always include: "...clean background, no vices, handsome appearance, articulate, and between the ages of eighteen and twenty-five..." Not only must they be handsome and youthful, but also well-groomed. Dressed in spotless white uniforms, they shuttle back and forth between the dining hall and the auditorium. Like female waitresses suffer mental wounds, do we male waiters not suffer the same? We also have to endure the whims and demands of customers! Look at the facts below:

The door opens, and a group of distinguished guests pour in.

"Gentlemen, how many?" We greet them warmly with a bow.

"Hmm!..." A hat is handed over, as if they don't care. "Sir, what tea would you like?" Another bow. "Green tea, quickly, bring the menu."

"Yes! Yes..." Another bow.

"Waiter!" Banging the bowls, "Why is this dish so salty? Damn it! Did you steal the salt?" They probably just lost money at the Jai Alai court, otherwise they wouldn't be so aggressive.

"I'm sorry! Sir, I'm sorry..." I really have no reason to argue with him, another bow, a second bow, a third...

"Damn it! The Huadiao wine is lukewarm, how am I supposed to drink it?" It's clearly hot, but they are nitpicking and yelling at you, but they are customers, so how can you not endure it?

"Yes! Yes... I'll go heat it up!" Helplessly, another bow.

"Oh! What is this? A bug! A bug!..." An unknown object flies from their chopsticks, hitting me full in the face, making me all greasy. My head throbs, my blood boils, my hands tremble, and I wish I could punch them. But the gaze of the supervisor standing nearby sweeps over me, finally suppressing my impending outburst. The relentless whip of life swings in my mind, and I have to swallow my anger and give another apologetic bow.

Handing out towels, a bow; serving tea, a bow; seeing them off, a bow, a second bow, a third...

Statistically speaking, serving a table of dishes requires at least ten bows, and sometimes even swallowing one's pride! We are all human beings, why should we be subjected to such cruel treatment? Should we just tolerate this humble profession like this? No! I am struggling on the path of life, actively struggling. I must continue to study and improve myself. I need to learn, to learn how to fight against this harsh environment in the future. We are young people, and young people should have the vigor of youth. The needles of vanity and snobbery will not bury my will. I believe that one day I will escape this suffering!

### Sunlight, Air, and Water

— Yun Sheng

A person who falls out of the "ivory tower," whether male or female, always cries out. But as long as the mother's breast is put into their little mouth, the crying stops. So I dare to boldly say that the purpose of a person's birth into this world is to eat. Once they start eating, just open the ancient and modern histories, regardless of the East, West, South, and North, or the Yellow, White, Brown, and Black races. From emperors and heroes to vendors and footmen, which one is not stirring up trouble and working busily for fame, power, wealth, and glory? Look at Hitler today, mobilizing millions of troops, and Roosevelt, shouting by the fireside. What are they doing it for? Ultimately, isn't it for bread?

Now, back to the main topic. Regardless of whether it's bread or white rice, the purpose of eating is to provide our bodies with the "heat" it needs, to form tissues, and to adjust the changes of substances within the body. This is the same principle as a car needing gasoline to drive its engine. When food enters our mouth, after being chewed by the teeth and mixed with saliva, the starch is transformed into glucose. When we are chewing, the nostrils help to constantly breathe in outside air. Therefore, when food enters our stomach through the throat, it has already become the "heat" (i.e., energy) we need. And the main components that make up our "energy" are sunlight, air, and water. These three gifts that God has given to mankind can be enjoyed by everyone, regardless of wealth or poverty. It is shameful to say that the flowers and trees, which people regard as offerings on their desks and decorations in their gardens, can use sunlight, air, and water to grow continuously. However, people who call themselves the spirit of all things cannot use these three elements of life to produce the food we need. There are many chemists in the world who are working hard to extract gold from seawater. But even if all the seawater on earth is extracted into gold, can this gold be eaten as food? This is another question. Even if it can, is the excrement that is excreted gold? This is another question. Can nine out of ten of the world's poor enjoy it equally? This is even more of a question. If chemists could use sunlight, air, and water to create the "energy" that people need in the laboratory, then not only would no one hoard rice, but this vast and terrible world war would also stop harmoniously.

12 After the Backyard Flower

Wei Cheng nodded and said, "So, you're leaving?" Huang Long snorted in his nose and said, "Where am I going? I just don't admire that old woman. It's like sitting in the commander's tent and issuing orders, making me look too easy to deal with. I saw that there was a white, milky-like doorbell on the door, so I reached out and pressed it. While I was lighting a cigarette, the old woman opened the door and started scolding. I thought, I'm not afraid of officials sitting high up scolding me. I'm really not afraid of someone who's eaten a few more years of yellow rice scolding me. As she scolded, I crawled under her armpit and into the house. This alarmed a woman in mourning clothes, who said: Guoq doesn't live here, Guofang went back to Shuangqiao Town this morning. If you trust me, this letter is for the Ye family, saying that the old lady in the village is sick. Okay, she wants her granddaughter to go back. Her granddaughter should be there for her. Her grandson is like a horse without reins. I don't know if he went back with Guofang. You can go and tell the Ye family this." Wei Cheng said: "This woman in mourning clothes must be Guoq and Guofang's stepmother." Huang Long said: "I don't care if she is or not, she would have spoken to me more politely, and I would have left."

Wei Cheng is now lying to everyone he meets. Xian asked in surprise, "Guofang went to Shuangqiao Town? If I had known she was going back to Shuangqiao Town, I would have waited for her for two days." Huang Long snorted in his nose again and said, "Dealing with you scholars is really a headache. I stayed in Shanghai for one night and came back to Shuangqiao today. I asked Wang the Madman, and he said you went out yesterday and didn't come back. I went to the Chen family to ask again. Brother Wei Cheng!" He suddenly grabbed Wei Cheng and said softly, "Do you know: their girl has come back, and their boy has also come back." Wei Cheng said: "Who told you that?" Huang Long said: "I walked to their door and saw the brother and sister standing on the steps talking. Their faces are the same, and the picture you have in your pocket is the same. Do I need to ask? Does someone need to tell me? I thought, if you went from the inn to their house, they would definitely talk to you. Now, only they don't have you, so you're not in their house. That's why I rushed back here, you, you, you, I ask you, if you don't make a move at this time, when will you make a move?" Wei Cheng was both ashamed and angry at what he said, and said, "I'll go with you!" (251)
