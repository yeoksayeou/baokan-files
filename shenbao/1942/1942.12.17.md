### Understanding and Preparation for a Protracted War

The ongoing World War is being forced towards the prospect of a "protracted war." Because once a war is launched, as the famous German strategist Clausewitz said, "It will not follow the will of the war initiator, but will follow the laws of war itself!" The current war, after being brewed and promoted by Britain and the United States, has been moving towards a protracted war day by day. Moreover, the United States and its system are exaggerating magical numbers, intentionally driving Britain, the Soviet Union, Chongqing, etc., to wage a war against the Axis powers, in order to dominate the world when everyone is exhausted, so they are intentionally making the war enter a protracted phase. However, from the perspective of East Asian countries, how should we observe the meaning of the so-called protracted war? Recently, an article by Colonel Taniogi Nahao, Chief of the Army Press Section of the Japanese General Headquarters, "The New Face of Protracted War" (translation appears in today's newspaper), is worthy of our attention.

Colonel Taniogi frankly pointed out the current war situation and the trend towards a protracted war, and Japan's determination for "tomorrow's decisive battle." He said, "In order to thoroughly subdue Britain and the United States in the future, our army will attack India, Australia, Alaska, etc. In the meantime, there will be countless major and minor decisive battles, either spaced apart or continuous. Therefore, today's protracted war can be said to be a composite of protracted and short-term wars." He further clearly pointed out that a protracted war is beneficial to the Axis powers. He pointed out, "In the near future, if the United States and Britain cannot achieve a decisive victory, the domestic and foreign situation will fall into a difficult state. In any case, in the next year or two, the United States and Britain must deploy all their forces to inflict a fatal blow on the Axis powers. In other words, a protracted war is just empty talk, and they still hope for a quick victory." So, from the perspective of the interests of East Asian countries and peoples, what kind of preparations should be made in a protracted war of this meaning? Colonel Taniogi made it clear that because this war is "a protracted war in which major and minor decisive battles continue for a long period of time. In track and field competitions, this is not a race, but an obstacle race. If it is a race, it is okay not to exert effort at the beginning, but in an obstacle race, you must exert effort from the beginning!" Therefore, in order to achieve the final victory, Japan must not only prepare the necessary conditions for victory in the final conclusion of the war, but also, because this final decisive battle is also an accumulation of victories in "major and minor decisive battles" that "continue for a long period of time," it must immediately concentrate all the forces of the domestic occupied areas and allied countries to prepare for victory in the major and minor decisive battles during the protracted war.

We, China, are in such an era of protracted war, and in such a war environment and strategic requirements. According to the task of cooperation between China and Japan in the Greater East Asia War, it is also necessary to assign new tasks to China and its people, just as this war has given to Japan and its people.

### Meeting of Japanese Ambassadors and Consuls in China Opens in the Capital This Morning to Discuss Plans to Intensify Sino-Japanese Cooperation Ambassador Shigemitsu Returns to Japan After the Meeting

Tokyo, 16th, Domei News Agency - According to official sources, under the guidance of the Greater East Asia Ministry, the new initiative of Japanese agencies stationed in China is to expand the authority of Ambassador Shigemitsu Kuri, placing Inner Mongolia, North China, Central China, and South China under the jurisdiction of Shigemitsu Kuri, which can make Japan's policies in China proceed more smoothly and achieve its goals quickly. From now on, the Minister in Shanghai, under the guidance of Ambassador Shigemitsu Kuri, will handle the affairs of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces. However, regarding the affairs of Japanese residents and embassy staff, there is no need to report to superiors and they can be handled freely. At the same time, North China enterprises will be handled by the Minister in Beijing, and Central China enterprises will be handled by the Minister in Shanghai.

According to news from the Shanghai Continental News, the conference of Ministers and Consuls-General convened by Ambassador Shigemitsu is scheduled to open in Nanjing today to discuss various issues, including plans to intensify Sino-Japanese cooperation. Other topics include adhering to the instructions of Minister Aoki of the Greater East Asia Ministry, consolidating the specific plans of the National Government, and reorganizing the administrative organs of Japan stationed in China on a large scale to adapt to the second year of the Greater East Asia War. It is reported that Minister Shiozawa from Beijing and Minister Watanabe from Zhangjiakou left Shanghai for Nanjing at 9:00 am yesterday to attend the meeting.

Nanjing, 16th, Domei News Agency - According to an announcement here, the conference of Japanese Ministers and Consuls to China, which will open tomorrow morning, will last for two days. The agenda is as follows: First, Minister Tajiri from Shanghai will preside. The entire assembly will pay respects to the Emperor and pray for those who sacrificed in the war. Then, a representative will read the instructions of Minister Aoki and Foreign Minister Tani Masayuki. Then, Shigemitsu Kuri will give instructions. At noon, the ministers will report on their duties. In the evening, they will attend a banquet at Shigemitsu Kuri's official residence. The next morning, they will exchange views on important issues.

Tokyo, 16th, Domei News Agency - According to reliable sources here, Japanese Ambassador to Nanjing, Shigemitsu Kuri, is convening an embassy meeting in Nanjing, which will last for two days. Once the meeting is over, he will return to Tokyo again next week.

Nanjing, 16th, Central News Agency - The conference of Japanese Ministers and Consuls-General in China is specifically scheduled to be held in Nanjing on the 17th and 18th. This conference is not only the first important conference after the establishment of the Greater East Asia Ministry, but also coincides with the start of the second year of the Greater East Asia War, which further increases its importance. Since the establishment of the Greater East Asia Ministry, the local agencies have been unified. Japan is actively cooperating with our National Government to strengthen it, making it smoother. This conference is to be conducted in accordance with the established policy of strengthening the National Government through Sino-Japanese cooperation.

Nanjing, 16th, Central News Agency - The Japanese Embassy in China, based on its established policy of striving to strengthen the National Government, has decided to convene Ministers and Consuls-General stationed in various parts of China in Nanjing today (the 17th) to hold a cooperation meeting at the embassy. It is learned that Kamimura, Director of the Political Affairs Bureau of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Okumura, Chief of the Second Section, Imai, investigator of the Greater East Asia Ministry, and other officials sent by the Japanese government arrived in Nanjing yesterday (the 16th). Minister Shiozawa from Beijing, Minister Iwasaki from Mengjiang, Minister Tajiri from Shanghai, and twelve Consuls-General, including Kitazawa from Beijing, Yano from Shanghai, and Akahori from Xiamen, also arrived in Nanjing one after another. The conference is scheduled to begin at 9:45 am this morning (the 17th).

Nanjing, 16th, Central News Agency - The first conference of Ministers and Consuls-General stationed in various parts of China since the Japanese agencies in China were completely unified under the jurisdiction of the Greater East Asia Ministry will be held in Nanjing on the 17th and 18th. The most noteworthy point about this conference is that after the integration of various agencies, their functions and powers have been greatly strengthened. They have direct command and supervision over Ministers and Consuls-General in China. Major affairs in Mengjiang, North China, Central China, and South China will all be under the command of the Ambassador from now on. Therefore, the handling of policies towards China can be carried out quickly and forcefully. A summary of the new functional operations of agencies in China is as follows: (1) The Ambassador has the power to command and supervise Ministers, Consular Officers, Consuls-General, and Consuls in China. (2) Ministers stationed in Zhangjiakou and Beijing are, in principle, under the command and supervision of the Ambassador. However, for certain matters, such as affairs concerning the Mengjiang United Autonomous Government or the North China Political Affairs Commission, and administrative affairs for Japanese residents, unless otherwise instructed, the Ministers are directly under the command and supervision of the Minister of the Greater East Asia Ministry, and each Minister has the power to command and supervise the Consular Officers within their respective regions. (3) The Minister stationed in Shanghai is under the command and supervision of the Ambassador, and handles affairs under the jurisdiction of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces. However, administrative affairs related to Japanese residents are handled by the Minister, and he commands and supervises the Consular Officers in Central China and South China. (4) The supervision of local affairs of the North China Development and Central China Promotion Companies is undertaken by the Ministers in Beijing and Shanghai, respectively. Therefore, the supervision of the affairs of the North China Development Minister, which was formerly under the supervision of the foreign officials related to Mengjiang, will also be handled by the Minister stationed in Beijing in a unified manner. (5) However, legal matters related to consular trials are directly commanded and supervised by the Minister of the Greater East Asia Ministry to each Consular Officer.

Eight French and Vietnamese youths have now been sent to study in Japan under the student exchange program. An exhibition of Vietnamese art will also be held in Tokyo. As for the defense of Vietnam, after Japan and Vietnam signed a joint defense agreement, the necessary measures have been taken and air defense has been completed. From now on, Vietnamese civilians should no longer be subjected to unwarranted bombings.

### Governor-General Isogai Discusses the Restoration of Hong Kong in the Past Year

Hong Kong, 16th, Central News Agency - Governor-General Isogai of Hong Kong, on the occasion of the upcoming one-year anniversary of the occupation of Hong Kong on December 25th, issued a statement on the restoration of Hong Kong in the past year, as follows: The purpose of occupying Hong Kong is to thoroughly construct a new order in East Asia, establish the East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, and make it an important base for the countries of the Co-Prosperity Sphere. Based on this belief, I am engaged in governance and construction, making Hong Kong a base for cooperating in the completion of the Greater East Asia War. This is the basic policy of the military administration, and all aspects of politics, economy, education, and culture are carried out in accordance with this basic policy. However, with regard to the restoration of Hong Kong, the trends of the millions of overseas Chinese residing here should be considered. If their psychology can be grasped and they can be made to sincerely cooperate with our policies, then the completion of a bright Hong Kong and the completion of the Greater East Asia War will be closer. With the cooperation of the Chinese and Japanese people, port facilities, some factories, and cultural facilities in Hong Kong are all under construction. The shipping business has also been started, and trade with the coastal areas of Guangzhou, Shantou, and Macau is gradually progressing smoothly. Therefore, there is no need to worry about the shortage of food and other essential supplies. There has also been significant progress in education and health, which has resulted in the stability of the people's hearts. The state of construction of a bright Hong Kong cannot be said to be sufficient, but I am very satisfied with the achievements made in one year.

### The New Face of the Protracted War: Report by Colonel Taniogi Nahao, Chief of the Army Press Section, Imperial General Headquarters Translated from the "Osaka Newspaper," December 9

At 6:00 PM on the 8th, the Tokyo Hibiya Public Hall held a grand speech commemorating the first anniversary of the Greater East Asia War, titled "Smashing America and Britain." Colonel Taniogi Nahao, Chief of the Army Press Section of the Imperial General Headquarters, gave a detailed interpretation of the current war situation, titled "The New Face of the Protracted War." Colonel Taniogi said: "In the future, in order to thoroughly subdue America and Britain, our army will advance on India, Australia, Alaska, and other places. In the midst of this, countless major and minor battles will take place, either intermittently or continuously. Therefore, today's protracted war can be said to be a combination of protracted and short-term wars. However, if there is a contradiction between preparations for tomorrow and preparations for several years from now, we should focus on preparations for tomorrow and take swift action." From this, it can be seen that the current war situation is of extremely serious significance.

After the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the enemy, America and Britain, were vulnerable and defeated one after another. In East Asia, not a single base or soldier remained. Due to repeated defeats, the morale of the American government and public was very low, and their initial ideas for war guidance were inevitably passive and reactive. After a considerable period of time, they gradually regained their composure and began to establish independent strategies. That is to say, they interpreted the purpose of the war as defending democracy. On the one hand, they whipped Chongqing; on the other hand, they encouraged the Soviet Union, using them to restrain Japan and Germany, consuming the Axis powers' forces, and turning the war into a long-term, protracted war. In the meantime, they demanded extreme sacrifices from other countries, while they themselves became the arsenal of the democratic nations, specializing in logistical support. Rather than lending, they were selling weapons to obtain huge profits, and even after the war, they would continue this exploitation, making the whole world materially subordinate to America. Therefore, in terms of operational plans, they intended to greatly expand their land, sea, and air forces by 1944, and take advantage of the Axis powers' fatigue from prolonged warfare to launch a large-scale counterattack and achieve final victory in one fell swoop. As for Chongqing and the Soviet Union, which had been conducting guerrilla warfare with aircraft and submarines, they would do their best to support them.

America Hopes that Britain, the Soviet Union, and Chiang Kai-shek will Perish Together

In the final moment, only America would exist. Japan, Germany, and Italy, needless to say, but also Britain, the Soviet Union, and Chiang Kai-shek - America hoped they would all die out. That is to say, America wanted to repeat the cunning tricks it had used in World War I. However, with the progress of the war, they had to begin to realize that this path was not feasible. The reasons are as follows:

In order to defend democracy, America had to join hands with the Soviet Union, the greatest enemy of democracy, which was a major contradiction. Secondly, nominally a democratic country, it was actually strengthening the dictatoral power of the president, which was also very ridiculous. Recently, Roosevelt and Churchill had been enthusiastically producing the Atlantic Charter, proclaiming the need to respect freedom, but before their tongues had even dried, they were raping the will of the Indian people and suppressing their independence. In Iran, Iraq, Syria, Madagascar, and most recently in North Africa, they were carrying out illegal invasions against all weak countries and weak nations as if nothing had happened. A robber who has removed their mask, shamelessly says: "I am your friend." In particular, the Soviet Union was demanding the supply of military supplies and the opening of a second front at the cost of great sacrifice, but America and Britain sincerely hated such requests. This is increasingly believed to be true in regards to the US-Soviet agreement and the Anglo-Soviet agreement. In fact, the weapons used on the Soviet front are very few of American manufacture, and even those that exist are very old-fashioned. Furthermore, Stalin had already stated that America and Britain were not sincere in opening a second front.

America's Work with Chongqing

The Soviet Union, since the German army began its offensive this summer, had exhausted its war power and was now almost in a desperate situation. Chongqing, on the other hand, was experiencing rampant hyperinflation, a lack of supplies, and so on, and was eagerly awaiting aid from America and Britain. Both Chongqing and America were exploiting each other, which led to conflicts of interest and a tendency to break away. It was true that America had sent some aircraft to China, but according to the words of the captured American air force pilots who attacked Hong Kong, they were very dissatisfied with their combat life in China. On the other hand, as a result of the bombing, many innocent Chinese people suffered direct and indirect damage, and Chongqing also expressed various dissatisfactions with them.

The contradiction in war aims, the wavering of popular sentiment, the fear of weak countries, the stagnation of the German-Soviet war, the tendency of the Soviet Union and Chongqing to break away… these were all problems that gave America a headache. In addition, facing the strong national power of the Axis powers, especially Japan, America had to change its war guidance policy. That is to say, America, which had previously been the arsenal of the democratic nations, had to step onto the front line of combat. Roosevelt had previously said that American youth would never be sent to fight in other countries, but now, hundreds of thousands of young people had been sent out, and they were dying and being wounded every day, in numbers a hundred or a thousand times greater than those announced by the authorities. Some sank to the bottom of the sea, while others were reduced to white bones in the desert.

When America counterattacks Japan, it pays special attention to the two factors of "time" and "things," as detailed above. But can they really win? No, it is absolutely impossible. The construction of Japan's Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere is proceeding very smoothly, and Germany and Italy are continuing to exert their power in Europe. This is the guarantee of victory for whoever wins the decisive battle.

A Protracted War is Advantageous to the Axis Powers

Therefore, the longer the war lasts, the more profitable it will be for the Axis powers. In terms of shipping alone, America produces 500,000 tons per month, and Britain 100,000 tons, for a total of only about 600,000 tons. However, Axis submarines sink 700,000 to 800,000 tons each month, and sometimes even break the million-ton mark. If this continues, even if America and Britain fight like trapped beasts, their fighting spirit will not last long.

We may as well analyze it further: In the case of Britain, its shipping capacity must be maintained at at least about 7 million tons, otherwise, supply will be very difficult. In the case of America, no matter how developed its production capacity is, there are limits. In particular, many "tropical resources" essential to the military industry, such as rubber, tin, tungsten, etc., are very scarce. In addition, the unevenness of rationing, the lack of skilled workers, and the difficulty in replenishing the forces lost in repeated defeats are all causing America anxiety. Therefore, in the near future, if America and Britain cannot achieve a decisive victory, the domestic and international situation will fall into a state of difficulty. In any case, America and Britain must mobilize all their forces within the next year or two to inflict a fatal blow on the Axis powers. That is to say, a protracted war is just empty talk, and they still hope for a quick victory in their hearts.

The Importance of Guadalcanal

In this way, America began counterattacks in the South Pacific from early August and in the West Philippine from early November, on both the east and west sides. In the South Pacific, the focus is on Guadalcanal Island in the Solomon Islands.

Guadalcanal Island is about 2,700 nautical miles from Tokyo, and its area is about 10 miles long and 40 miles wide. It is simply a drop in the ocean in the Pacific. The island is sparsely populated, and most of it is rugged mountainous terrain, which is covered by lush forests. In such a wild place, a portion of our landing operations troops fought against a much larger enemy, repeatedly engaging in fierce hand-to-hand combat for several days and nights. Our army has always fought bravely under extremely difficult conditions. Weapons, bullets, and food were all lacking, but we still defeated the enemy.

Battles on the Mainland Reached Seventy Times a Day

In addition, on the battle lines of mainland China, the Imperial Army repeatedly engaged in Chongqing annihilation battles as many as seventy times a day. Recently, with the US Air Force as the main force, about 250 aircraft have launched guerrilla warfare against Japan in various parts of the mainland, attempting to carry out air raids on the mainland and threatening inland transportation routes. This is undoubtedly a part of the entire American counterattack operation against Japan, related to the Aleutian and Burma fronts.

In this way, the entire American counterattack operation against Japan has begun in the South Pacific, and in all aspects related to it, in the Aleutians, Burma, and mainland China. Regarding the significance of this war as a protracted war, I will explain it further below:

The Significance of the War as a Protracted War

The war has now reached its peak. Although there has been a distinction between victory and defeat in the war of force, the enemy has not yet surrendered, and guerrilla warfare is still continuing. It can also be said that after the initial defeat, the enemy is trying to reorganize their forces in order to seek a decisive battle several years later. Until then, if only guerrilla warfare or small-scale battles continue, then our country's policy should be one of detail and length, and everything should not deviate from the principle of conserving strength and building up energy. However, the Greater East Asia War is not just a protracted war of this kind. In order to subdue the enemy, we must continue to attack India, Australia, Alaska, and other places, and defeat the enemy's counterattacks against our occupied areas. In the midst of this, countless major and minor decisive battles will take place, either intermittently or continuously, and this war is a protracted war in which these major and minor decisive battles continue for a period of time. In terms of sports competitions, this is not a marathon, but a marathon obstacle race. If it is a marathon, it is okay not to run hard at the start, but in a marathon obstacle race, one must exert oneself from the beginning.

The War is a Combination of Long-Term and Short-Term

Therefore, today's protracted war is a combination of what is generally called a protracted war and a short-term war; it can also be said to be a kind of marathon obstacle race. The difficulties in war guidance, domestic countermeasures, and occupied territory administration stem from this. For example, in terms of production expansion alone, if it were simply a protracted war in the general sense, then even if the current production volume were reduced significantly, it would be fine as long as the things needed several years later were not lacking. Furthermore, if it were simply a short-term decisive battle, then everything else could be disregarded, as long as all efforts were devoted to today's increased production. However, because it is a composite protracted war, on the one hand, we must prepare for tomorrow's decisive battle, and at the same time, we must not forget about the many things several years from now. If there is a contradiction between preparations for tomorrow and preparations for several years from now, we should focus on preparations for tomorrow and take swift action.

Why? Because if we are defeated tomorrow, no matter how hard you work to increase production later, you will never win in the ultimate decisive battle. Now, the Americans are launching a counterattack against us. Americans see war as Sports. What is most important in sports is vigor. War also emphasizes vigor, so war can be said to be a kind of great sport. The following words are said by tens of thousands of prisoners in unison. Since the start of the war, they have suffered several defeats, but if this counterattack is severely frustrated, the war situation will be largely decided, and they may have to give up on future wars.

### Fierce Fighting Continues in Western Cyrenaica: British Frontal Offensive Repulsed, Attempts to Advance on Both Flanks Also Fail

Haitong News Agency, Berlin, German Headquarters, 16th - This afternoon's German military report stated that fierce fighting continued yesterday in western Cyrenaica. British losses included 16 tanks, multiple artillery pieces, and 4 aircraft. German aircraft bombed the port of Benghazi, and a German submarine pursued and sank an enemy submarine in the Eastern Mediterranean.

Haitong News Agency, Rome, 16th - This afternoon's Italian military report stated that German-Italian forces continued to engage in fierce fighting with strong enemy forces between Cyrenaica and Sirte, destroying 16 enemy tanks and multiple artillery pieces. The air force was also very active, with German aircraft shooting down 4 enemy planes. In Tunisia, our forces captured many American soldiers, and German aircraft heavily attacked the port of Bône with good results. Italian aircraft bombed fuel depots in Tripoli and refineries in Beirut, with 2 failing to return to base. Italian submarines sank an enemy ship near Algiers.

Haitong News Agency, Stockholm, 16th - London dispatches report that the British Eighth Army is advancing slowly. Any attempt at rapid advance will trigger German landmines, inevitably resulting in heavy casualties.

Havas News Agency, Berlin, 16th - According to military sources, the British army attempted to attack the Axis forces on the Cyrenaica front yesterday, but was repulsed due to a swift Axis counteroffensive. British Commander-in-Chief General Montgomery encountered extensive and well-laid minefields, forcing him to abandon frontal assaults along the coast and instead attack the German flanks. Although enemy soldiers and tanks were numerous, they were defeated by the determined and flexible defense of the Italian mechanized units. By evening, the British had lost 22 tanks and multiple armored vehicles. The weak British air force attempted to assist in the ground battle, but was intercepted by German fighter squadrons before reaching the battlefield, with 9 being shot down. The Axis forces suffered no losses. A British reconnaissance plane was also shot down.

Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 16th - Responsible sources stated yesterday that the British Eighth Army and the German-Italian forces under Rommel are continuing to fight. The battle situation in the Al 'Aqila area is particularly intense. Rommel's defensive strategy does not seem to be aimed at driving the enemy out of the Al 'Aqila area, but rather at using this battle to undertake new actions.

Rommel Changes Strategy: Joint Defense of Tunisia

Allied News Agency, Stockholm, 16th - London military circles are speculating about the sudden retreat of General Rommel's forces from Al 'Aqila. Although some newspapers claim that the German retreat will allow General Montgomery to advance rapidly, experts do not believe this move is beneficial to the Allies. British military opinion is that General Rommel understands that fighting in Al 'Aqila will have negative consequences, and the best strategy is to approach General Nehring's forces in Tunisia and, if possible, fight side-by-side. General Nehring currently has 30,000 troops and a continually increasing air force, but this is not yet a match for General Anderson's First Army. However, with the addition of Rommel's 50,000 troops, the situation would be different. The general opinion in London is that Rommel's objective is Tunisia, and they point out that the British naval bombardment of Axis positions along the coast is supporting the Eighth Army's advance, so Rommel's forces can only defend the more westerly areas. London military experts anticipate a long and arduous battle. The Eighth Army's supplies must still travel around the Cape of Good Hope, while reinforcements for the First Army are subject to attacks by German submarines in the Strait of Gibraltar, with multiple transport ships having already been sunk.

Haitong News Agency, Stockholm, 16th - Local newspapers report that a London correspondent stated that developments in the North African war remain the most closely watched event in British public opinion. Previously, the British advance into Tripolitania was generally considered a major victory, but this view has gradually changed recently. Rommel's forces advancing along Sirte could give the Axis powers a strategic advantage and geographical convenience in the Mediterranean. The airfields of Sicily are within sight across the sea, benefiting the Axis powers, while the Eighth Army's supply lines are becoming increasingly distant. The British believe that Rommel may abandon all of Tripolitania in order to focus on defending Tunisia, which is easier to control. What Rommel's strategy is will not be known for sure until a few days later. In short, based on reports from the North African front, the German-Italian forces are clearly retreating in a planned manner, maintaining good order. At the same time, the pursuing British forces are hindered by damaged roads and landmines, making it difficult to move quickly and offering few opportunities to engage the Axis forces. There is little news from Tunisia, and the British First Army remains on the defensive. The Allied forces at El Bahr have apparently completely withdrawn.

### More Bomb Explosions in Bombay

Allied News Agency, Lisbon, 16th - According to Bombay reports, another bomb exploded in a canteen in the military camp area on Monday night, seriously injuring several British soldiers. Police arrested 80 people yesterday.

Havas News Agency, Lisbon, 15th - According to Bombay reports, hundreds of local residents attacked three buses and looted several rice shops. Police authorities have arrested 80 residents.

### German Forces Repulse Soviet Offensives on the Eastern Front in the Terek Region: A Large Tank Battle Will Occur Between the Volga and Don Rivers

Haitong News Agency, Berlin, German Headquarters, 16th - This afternoon's German military report stated that Soviet offensives in the Terek region were repulsed yesterday, with 24 enemy tanks destroyed. Soviet counterattacks between the Don and Volga Rivers were also severely defeated by the German-Romanian forces. Most of the Soviet forces encircled southeast of Toropez have been annihilated.

Haitong News Agency, Ankara, 16th - News from Moscow today reports that fierce fighting continues in the Kotelnikovo district, southwest of Stalingrad. German tanks have broken through Soviet artillery positions at some points and encircled the Soviet flanks. The German offensive force is very strong.

Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 16th - Soviet forces attacked Italian positions on the Don front yesterday without success. They are deploying and attacking from the Terek region in the south to Lake Ilmen in the north. This move was anticipated by the German General Staff, and preparations have been made for a countermeasure, delivering a head-on blow. However, the details of the German countermeasure have not been announced.

### Laval Arrives in Paris, Will Meet with Hitler: Pétain Also Plans to Attend, Franco-German Relations Will Become Clear

Allied News Agency, Lisbon, 16th - According to Vichy reports, French Prime Minister Laval has requested a meeting with German Chancellor Hitler in the near future, which Marshal Pétain also plans to attend. Laval has arrived in Paris.

Haitong News Agency, Paris, 16th - French Prime Minister Laval arrived here yesterday and has met with Brinon, the French government's delegate-general to the German-occupied zone, Finance Minister Cathala, and Police Chief Bousquet.

Central News Agency, Madrid, 16th - According to political observers here, French Prime Minister Laval has completed discussions with Marshal Pétain and his cabinet, so he will travel to Paris again. It is expected that this meeting will lead Franco-German relations into a new stage. Since the Allied forces invaded French colonies, it has been over two months. During this period, Prime Minister Laval has secured full governmental powers, enhanced his domestic position, and conducted specific reviews on strengthening the Mediterranean coastal defenses, adjusting the border line after the German forces entered the unoccupied zone, determining the legal status of the Dover Strait area, and restricting foreign diplomats when returning the capital to Paris. It is generally believed that because these pending issues have been resolved, it is expected that after Prime Minister Laval meets with Chancellor Hitler, he will make a final decision on the future relationship between Germany and France. It is also reported that Chancellor Hitler's representative, Field Marshal von Rundstedt, met with Marshal Pétain in Vichy on the 11th, expressing Germany's hope that France would rebuild its army. It is also expected that Prime Minister Laval will, based on the results of his meeting with Chancellor Hitler, return the capital to Paris within two or three months and immediately begin organizing a single political party.

### From the South Pacific Naval Battle to Tomorrow's Decisive Battle Participants in the Discussion: Naval Press Section Chief of the Imperial Headquarters, Colonel Hiraide; Editorial Director of the Tokyo Nichi Nichi Shimbun, Kenichi Abe (4) Translated from the December 13th "Sunday Mainichi"

Hiraide: During the last World War, Germany had submarine merchant ships that were known to have gone to New York.

·A Resolution to Endure a Century-Long War...

Abe: With an unwavering belief in victory, we must thoroughly defeat Britain and the United States. Strengthening all aspects of domestic production is also a very important condition. Our primary task after smelting is: production expansion. It is impossible to know how many years and months this war will last. It's like a person working, with times of vigor and times of fatigue. Regardless, we must all do our part to help the government complete its planned goals, which is to help guarantee the final victory of the Greater East Asia War.

Hiraide: If production expansion can proceed smoothly, the soldiers on the front lines will have no worries about the rear, and then the war will surely be won. However, there is a part of production expansion that cannot be forgotten, and that is the production expansion of "people." In the event of such a large war, the reduction of the population rate is a world principle. Regarding this point, the "Ministry of Health and Welfare" has naturally made its best efforts, but due to natural trends, the war will always reduce the population rate. Therefore, the prerequisite problem must be: have more children! Secondly, the education of children is also very important. We must strengthen nationalistic education so that children become excellent people with sound minds and bodies. Using this to make up for the small number of people is the best way. If this can be achieved, and the three aspects of thought, mind, and body become a trinity of excellent individuals, then even if the number of people is small, they can still be worth ten, and there will be no fear. The production expansion of the second soldier in production expansion is a serious problem. It's not enough for children to be born, they must be made into elite soldiers. Regarding this, we have also said a lot during "Military Support Strengthening Week." The most important thing in military support is production expansion. Soldiers fighting on the front lines only have two major concerns! One is the replenishment and supply of weapons, and the other is the peaceful life of people at home. What dominates the minds of the front-line soldiers, in the end, is these two things.

Abe: Speaking of this, we can come to the conclusion that: relying on the power of our army and navy, we are already winning step by step. The task of our people in the rear is to enable the people on the front lines to continue to fight with peace of mind. To enable the people on the front lines to fight with peace of mind, we must do everything we can to engage in production, manufacture weapons, and complete many other necessary tasks. The matters of the next twenty or thirty years must be considered right now. The Anglo-Saxon nations are nations that will rise again in twenty or thirty years. Even if they have fallen once, they will still rise again in twenty years. Another fiery decisive battle after a considerable period of time is also unpredictable.

Hiraide: Perhaps we will have to repeat the decisive battle three times, which is also unknown. The so-called century-long war refers to this. This does not mean that we will be fighting constantly for a hundred years, but that once we stand up, we will have to fight a second and third time. If we are even slightly negligent in this regard, the final victory cannot "certainly belong to us."

The Newspaper: Thank you for saying so much, both of you... (Translated by Qian Mu)

### Vowing to Eradicate the Black Market with All Our Strength Applying Strong Measures Cooperation between the Police Department and the Control Office Awaiting the Final Step After Verification

A senior official of the Shanghai Municipal Police stated, "The Police Department authorities will not cease investigating and prosecuting until the black market trade in this city is completely eliminated. The Materials Control Office is fully cooperating with the Police Department. Once the investigation is completed, strong measures will be taken against speculators and those engaged in black market transactions.

Speculative Merchants Entirely Brought to Court

The official continued to declare that last week, police officers at the cotton cloth exchange arrested 364 speculative brokers. This is the turning point for a comprehensive investigation. Those arrested are being interrogated one by one. If solid evidence is found, they will all be brought to court for trial. Because bringing them to court individually is more complicated, handling all of them together will result in the same crime being punished. When asked when the evidence will be verified, it is said that it will take at least one month. However, when taking the final step, the Materials Control Office and the Police Department will take a dominant position, and the elimination of black market activities is only a matter of time.

Revealing the Masterminds Behind the Scenes

The recent efforts of the Police Department to curb black market transactions are due to the resurgence of speculative merchants engaging in illegal activities. The brokers and others who were arrested on the spot during the raid on the exchange had a lot of evidence. When asked what impact this investigation will have on the masterminds behind the scenes, it is said that the true faces of the masterminds will soon be revealed, and the punishment they receive will naturally be heavier than that of ordinary brokers. In three months, the number of speculative brokers arrested has reached thousands. After interrogation, there have been many new discoveries. These discoveries will greatly help the work of eliminating the black market.

### Shanghai Branch of the Relief Commission Manages Winter Relief in Shanghai

Subsidizing the Puji Sanatorium with 100,000 Yuan Winter Relief Funds Set at 450,000 Yuan Donations from Allied Envoys to the Children's Education Institute

The Shanghai Puji Sanatorium in Minhang, Shanghai, is jointly funded and managed by the Public Concession, the French Concession, and the Shanghai Municipal Government. Now, Director-General Okazaki of the Public Concession has requested the Relief Commission to decide to allocate 100,000 yuan to the sanatorium. Director-General Okazaki and Chairman Fang Tongshen of the Shanghai Branch of the Relief Commission once discussed this matter in person, and this fund will be used for the quota of patients outside the city.

It is also heard that the Shanghai Branch of the Relief Commission's winter relief fund for this year has been decided to be 450,000 yuan, for handling porridge relief, clothing relief, shelter from the cold, and subsidizing charity projects. The estimated number of people receiving relief is more than 300,000 units. The branch is actively preparing. The Father Relief Commission has always attached great importance to the relief of refugee children. In addition to running the Capital Children's Education Institute, it is now planning to open the Shanghai Children's Education Institute, selecting the former site of the orphanage in Longhua. Chairman Fang Tongshen of the Shanghai Branch is responsible for the preparations. It is heard that in addition to the fixed relief funds, there are also 200,000 yuan donated by three Allied envoys. In the future, this institute will be a solemn friendly undertaking for the national societies of China and Japan.

### French Concession Checking Residence Permits

The French Consul-General, Majella, issued a notice a few days ago stating that the identity residence permits for people in the concession have been fully issued and will be checked on a regular basis. If travelers stay in hotels, people pawn items in pawnshops, and pedestrians encounter checks on the road, they must show this document. The details have been reported in the newspapers. It is now known that this measure has been implemented since yesterday. In addition to hotels and pawnshops asking guests to verify their documents, police officers from the French Concession are dispatching Chinese and Vietnamese detectives at the iron gates at the junction of Huafa to conduct inspections. Certificates from the three parties of the two concessions and Nanshi are all valid for passage. However, because each one has to be checked one by one, it takes a lot of time, so pedestrians are extremely crowded. Those who do not carry this certificate, or the old certificates issued by Nanshi before, will be rejected and not allowed to enter the concession.

It is also learned that the residence permits in the urban area have not yet been fully issued, and some residents feel inconvenienced. It is now known that the authorities, in view of this, have made a special accommodation. Residents in the urban area can also pass through the iron gates with the fourth root of the residence permit application form.

### Air Raid Drills Continue Time of Alerts is Uncertain or May Not be Lifted All Night Long Arousing Public Awareness

After the comprehensive air defense training exercises were held continuously for two days on the 14th and 15th, the alert was stopped for one day yesterday. It will continue to be held from today until the 23rd of this month. The training exercise will last for a total of ten days. The nature of this comprehensive air defense training exercise is different from the last one. Because the last one only controlled lights, the exercise was limited to the evening. This time, because important training programs have been added, the exercise is not limited to the evening. Air raid sirens will also be sounded at any time during the day.

The Timing of the Alerts is Not Fixed

Therefore, during the ten-day exercise period, the alert may not be lifted at night after the alert is issued in the evening, or it may only be held during the day and no alert is issued in the evening. It is extremely complex, arousing residents' awareness and creating an outstanding situation. Since yesterday, public concession police, baojia, self-defense corps members, and fire brigade members have begun special air defense control comprehensive training, and it is stipulated that it will be held in sections. Those who held it yesterday were the Yangshupu Yulin Road two districts, and today Jiayu Road and Hongkou District will continue to hold it.

Model Baojia in Lao Zha District Inspected

Baojia No. 4 Lianbao No. 4 in Lao Zha District of the Public Concession was recently designated by the authorities as a model baojia. The baozheng, Baochang Li Wencai, and deputy baochang Zheng Heyan Xu Yunsheng planned and organized it, establishing air defense, fire fighting, ambulance, traffic light control, and other teams, and once performed on-site, with satisfactory results. At 9:00 a.m. the day before yesterday, Captain Hashida Hashimoto, specially dispatched by the Naval Landing Force, led soldiers and, together with Chief Nakano of the Lao Zha Police Department, Chief of the Criminal Section Nagatokoro, and Okumura, the chief of the baojia system, went to the baojia for inspection. The baojia was greeted by all the baojia executives, Zhou Yutang, Chen Ruizhang, Yuan Rongsheng, etc. Then Shan Hao Ruichen, Ding Min, Jin Songsheng, and Wu Qinsun led all the team members to listen to the inspection, and the results were good. It is heard that at 9:00 a.m. this morning, the authorities will send personnel to continue to inspect the baojia. On the afternoon of the 19th, a comprehensive training exercise will be held, and there will be performances such as fire fighting and ambulance.

### Total Amount of Shanghai Old Currency Exchange

Within one month in November, the National Old Currency Consolidation Committee stipulated that the comprehensive exchange of old currency should be carried out in three provinces and two cities. The relevant authorities in various places are now compiling accurate figures and submitting them. It is now learned that Shanghai has submitted the exchange of approximately 23 million yuan. Other places are rushing to complete the statistics. Once completed, the total amount of comprehensive exchange in the country can be settled and statistically analyzed.

### The 21st Period of Food Rationing by Headcount No Change in Allocation

The quality and quantity of rice allocation are the same as the 20th period, still one liter of brown rice and half a liter of broken rice, priced at 3.8 yuan in new currency, and one and a half jin of flour, priced at 3.4 yuan in new currency, for a combined sale of 7.2 yuan. The authorities and the Rice Management Committee have not yet mentioned whether or not there will be sales for one day on New Year's Day.

Food Problem Forum

### Further Suggestions

— Chen Xianmo

Is the Shanghai food problem becoming more serious? It is indeed not to be ignored. Shen Bao advocated it in the past, and Chairman Yuan Ludeng of the Chamber of Commerce discussed it later. Its seriousness is indeed undeniable. However, concrete methods have not yet been discussed. As a citizen, I dare to make further explorations.

Regarding the countermeasures to solve the severity of the food problem, the following theories can be obtained by combining the grand theories of the past:

(1) Increase the amount of food rationing by headcount,

(2) Effectively evacuate unemployed residents,

(3) Implement a rice ticket system,

(4) Allow peddlers and rice merchants to purchase freely.

The first method seems to be an imminent move. The second still relies on the citizen's own reports and the strict discrimination of the authorities. The third seems to be more difficult to implement in practice. The fourth may be an obstacle to the control policy. Therefore, except for the first item being an urgent task at the moment, the other items can be temporarily ignored. Because the rice received by the general public every period, no matter what, is not enough. If it can be increased by more than half, so that everyone can seek their fill every day, there is no need to seek additional supplements other than household rice. The so-called price of illegal rice will fall without being suppressed. Not only that, I am afraid that no one will be interested in illegal rice. At the same time, the price increases of other commodities will be immediately curbed, which is expected. Therefore, the household rice should be increased in the allocation amount, which can become a natural law. Citizens should make systematic requests at this time and on this day, hoping that the authorities will adopt them. At present, the baojia system is still well managed. All citizens within the baojia have a vital interest. Opinions should be solicited from house to house within the baojia district. The heads of each household should jointly sign in their respective baojia districts, and then the baos should be collected and submitted to the lianbao chief for submission to the chairman of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to make a cautious request to the authorities, so that the food problem can be solved as soon as possible. In order to meet the needs of Sino-Japanese cooperation and the Greater East Asia War, and at the same time take into account the minimum living conditions of the people, it is necessary to practice the food policy to prepare for long-term needs. The authorities will surely adopt public opinion in such a request, so that the people can reduce their suffering, which is no different from rescuing citizens from deep waters and scorching fires.

### A Report

— Xianxian

I am now reporting on the food problem of my family. I am a salaried person, a couple. In the recent ten days, I received household rice, two liters of brown rice, one liter of broken rice, and three jin of flour. We are northerners and originally liked to eat flour the most; but these three jin of flour, calculated at half a jin per person per meal, can only provide one and a half days of food. Brown rice and broken rice together are three liters, totaling 78 taels. My husband and I eat 13 taels per meal, for a total of three days. So the household rice we received is only enough for four and a half days of food. For the remaining five days, a total of eleven meals, we had to buy corn flour, pea flour, yellow millet, etc. to supplement, requiring about 14 taels per meal, totaling about ten jin. Since November, corn flour has increased from 2.2 yuan per jin to 3.5 yuan, and yellow millet has increased from 3 yuan per jin to 4.4 yuan, so in ten days, the burden has increased by about 13 yuan, and in a month, the burden has increased by more than 39 yuan. If a family has ten people, then the burden will increase by more than 190 yuan. Can you say that it is not the most serious problem? I often go to various coarse grain stores to watch the wooden signs of various coarse grain prices. They increase almost every one or two days. Once, the yellow millet the day before was 3.3 yuan per jin, and the next day it increased to 4 yuan. So now, no one dares to predict how much the price of food will rise before it stops. Thinking of this, how can people not feel chills? Therefore, we pray day and night to the wise authorities to double the amount of household rice. Within ten days, we can have nine days of food, and the shortage of one day of food will be easy to solve. It is like hoping for clouds in a great drought.

### To Avoid Chaos Orderly Purchase of Oil Based on House Tax Receipts Each Household in Both Concessions Can Purchase Two Jin Urban Areas Can Purchase Half a Jin Based on Household Registration Certificates

Recently, the amount of edible oil arriving in Shanghai has been relatively scarce, resulting in insufficient supply and sales. Although the edible oil industry wholesale department has tried its best to maintain it, it is like a drop in the bucket and still does not help. In recent days, the storefronts of various retail edible oil stores have been very crowded and disorderly. In view of this, the wholesale department specially decided yesterday to formulate a new method for purchasing oil. It is planned that starting from the 20th of this month, public concessions will purchase two gold coins based on autumn house tax receipts, and French concessions will purchase two gold coins based on September and October house tax receipts. Shanghai West, Nanshi, Zhabei, and Pudong will purchase half a jin of oil based on household registration certificates. It is heard that this is a temporary measure. Once the source is smooth, it will be improved. At present, there are a total of 5,000 dan that can be shipped for sale. If there are no unexpected obstacles, the supply of edible oil should be normal. Also, the allocation department is currently setting the retail price of edible oil at 7.2 yuan per jin for soybean oil and 6.2 yuan per jin for rapeseed oil.

Investigating and Punishing the Oil Cartel

According to the opinions expressed by the edible oil industry office, citizens are concerned that the supply of edible oil is about to run out, so they are all scrambling to buy, resulting in great chaos. The most hateful thing is that there are often unscrupulous citizens who organize an oil cartel, making it difficult for genuine oil buyers to buy. The police authorities have paid close attention to this point. Once it is cracked down, it will be severely punished. Also, retail stores sometimes deduct oil and create a black market. It is hoped that citizens will cooperate with the authorities and report such incidents to the police station. The most severe crime should be punished. Citizens may purchase oil based on house tax receipts, and if necessary, oil may be allocated based on headcount. These are all being carefully considered by the distribution authorities. Once realized, the fear of buying oil will be eliminated.

### Detailed Rules for Prohibiting the Trading of Stocks Have Been Promulgated Listing of Chinese Merchant Stocks Should Be Approved First

(4) Stock industry merchants, except for merchants, banks, trust companies, etc. that also operate luxury goods, should pay a deposit in accordance with the provisions of Article 3 of the Prohibition Rules. (5) The aforementioned deposit shall be collected and stored by the Shanghai Special Municipality Fuxing Bank and shall be given annual interest in accordance with the regulations. (6) If stock industry merchants encounter new shares of Chinese merchant companies being listed, they should first report to the Social Affairs Bureau. After verification, they can be traded.

### Chinese Stocks Continue to Fall, Great China Match Surges Amidst Acquisition Interest

Yesterday, the Chinese stock market situation continued to decline amidst the pressure of the approaching year-end and tight credit. However, some stocks rose on favorable news. For example, the Great China Match Company announced that each old share would receive five new shares and a dividend of thirteen yuan and twenty cents. The acquisition became even more enthusiastic, once again rising to an unprecedented high price of three hundred and ninety yuan. In the end, it returned slightly by five yuan, still rising by five yuan compared to the previous day. New Asia Pharmaceutical Factory, among the new pharmaceutical industries, also had a shareholder meeting today where old shareholders would have various preferential rights. Investors absorbed as much as possible, and the regular price rose from sixty-six yuan and a half to sixty-nine yuan and a half for the final transaction price, a rise of one yuan and a half. There were buyers above seventy yuan later, but sellers disappeared, and the rising momentum was the sharpest. The Sino-Western Pharmacy did business at four hundred and seventy-five yuan, then seventy yuan, an increase of ten yuan. Minyi also rose one yuan to ninety-one yuan. Other stocks, however, fell amidst selling pressure. Sino-French Pharmacy fell to twenty-nine yuan. Xinyi was difficult to sell even at two hundred and sixty yuan. Star Perfume retreated to two hundred and thirty-two yuan and a half. The cultural industry Jiu Jue softened. Gao Wu Zhonghua stepped lower and did not return, falling by five yuan to two yuan and a half. The world retreated to one hundred and five yuan, then seven yuan, still down slightly by three yuan. The department store industry fell in many lots. The National Goods Company broke through eighty yuan and finally returned to the checkpoint. Innerwear fell by one yuan to around thirty-three yuan. Wing On retreated to one hundred and thirty-three to four yuan, while Sincere fell by one yuan and a half to three yuan, which was inconsistent. Wing On Textile fell slightly by fifteen yuan to around one thousand nine hundred yuan. Small-denomination tickets tended to be sluggish and flat. Rongfeng rose to over fifty yuan, and the family industry traded at five hundred and twenty-five yuan. In the public utilities sector, Zhabei Water and China Electric Power both fell first and then returned, each rising slightly by one yuan. Other stocks were flat. The list is shown below:

### Government Bonds Tend to Soften

Government bonds are sluggish and gradually soften, first because there is no 'formal market' and cannot be circulated, and second because of the approaching year-end and tight credit. Therefore, only a very small number of speculators who want to maintain their livelihood rely on the current market. Therefore, the range of price fluctuations is also extremely limited. Even the price that is done is not enough to represent the value of the government bond. Yesterday, Type C initially traded at seven yuan and then retreated to six yuan and thirty-four cents. Type A and E had no market, Type B was five yuan and fifty-six cents, and Type D was only three yuan and fifty-six cents. At this year-end period, the futures market is also trending towards dispersion, let alone during this controlled period. Therefore, transactions are also extremely small.

### Although Cloth Sales Are Weak, Prices Are Rising, Peach Blossom Lady Forest is Sturdier

The factory cloth market yesterday still felt quiet in terms of actual sales transactions. However, the goods registered by the industry are not being sold loosely, so the market has turned upward. White goods, coarse and fine cloth, have generally called for higher prices of one or two yuan per piece. Colored goods are even more stable. Peach Blossom Lady Forest Factory's single price is two hundred and ninety-eight yuan, and the spot price is three hundred and five yuan, with no place to find it.

East Piece: Transactions are still rare, and prices have risen. The 12-pound Dragon Head Fine China Banking list rose from 192 yuan to 195 yuan and 5 cents. The Dragon Head New Factory list is 194 yuan and 5 cents, Rainbow Ball is 195 yuan, and Flying Fish Yang Crane and Horns are all about 194 yuan, up to three yuan. Four Gentlemen Biji Hongdan 7 yuan 6 cents 1 and a half points, made to 7 yuan 6 cents half, Banking list 7 yuan 7 cents.

### Horse Mane Satin Willing to Sell Cheap

Unwilling to store until this day next year. The weather has been cold in recent days, and the business of various coats has increased, and the sales of horse mane satin needed for sleeve affairs have been very prosperous. The selling price is far more flat and tired than woolen goods. Yesterday, the horse mane satin woven with gold yarn was wholesaled at nine yuan to twelve yuan and fifty cents per yard. Artificial silk intertwined horse mane satin was wholesaled at eighteen yuan to twenty-seven yuan and fifty cents per yard. The reason for its smooth sales and flat price is that the production and storage are full, and if you want to turn around and need money, you are willing to sell at cost or at a slight loss. Once the father is over the winter, the actual sales will pass, and the cargo owner is unwilling to store it until this day next year.

### Ornamental Gold Internal Disk Weak, Dismantling Interest Rises to Two Corners

Yesterday, the municipal silver building industry, Dashin peers jewelry gold door market was still suspended at three thousand three hundred and fifty yuan per tael (receipt decreased by about two hundred and fifty yuan), and the unofficial market price of peers inherited the fatigue of the previous day and turned downward. Jin Bang sold out, and the entrants waited and watched. The morning was three thousand two hundred and eighty yuan, twenty yuan lower. In the situation of little supply and less demand, the noon retreated to three thousand two hundred and fifty yuan, fifty yuan lower than the previous day. The afternoon was even more virtual, retreating to three thousand two hundred yuan. The price of jewelry patterned silver is still sixteen yuan per tael, and Hengfu hangs two yuan less, which is also sixteen yuan. The price of peers is between eighteen and a half yuan and nineteen yuan.

The Money Industry Association's dismantling interest was raised by three points to two corners.

The Japanese military ticket is still little changed, and the inter-peer price is between five yuan, five corners, five points, three five percent. The silver number and the small money bank door market buys in at five corners and four points and sells out six points.

### Miscellaneous Grains Transaction Bean Cakes Are More

Yesterday's miscellaneous grain transaction, with bean cake as the bulk price, was firm because fertilization and edible digestion are both good. Bean sales were rare and prices were flat. It is planned to open more than 20 bags of Chongming Shayuan, priced at 309 yuan, and 20 bags of Sha Chih, priced at 338 yuan, 4 trucks of Fei Zi bean cakes, priced at 80 yuan and 05 cents to 83 yuan and 5 cents, a truck of Yuanlong bean cakes, priced at 83 yuan, and 500 pieces of Yuan Ji bean cakes, priced at 80 yuan and 05 cents.

### Persimmon Cakes Opening Price Rises Again

Recently, persimmon cakes have continued to arrive at a higher cost, so all parties have held back and sold less. Yesterday, the Nanshi store opened up to fifteen yuan more than before, but compared to the price in Nanjing, it is much inferior.

### Black Date Market is Very Firm

The black date market is still tight. Yesterday, the stores opened more than 150 pieces, the goods were better, and the identity was very dry. The price of Tianjin Regulation was 750 yuan, and the strength of the market has clearly improved in recent days. The market image is very firm.

### Mandarin Orange Cakes Only Arrived Ten Pieces

The former goods of Bridge Cake have long been opened up. Although there are continuous arrivals from the stores, the number is only 10 pieces, and the cost of external fees has increased in addition to the cost, which is higher than before, so the asking price is also higher than before. Approximately, it can be transferred to the warehouse in a few days, so there is a real disk.

### Tinplate and Hui Si Tin, None Will Be Out of Stock

The tinplate market has been short for a long time. Whether it is 90 pounds, 100 pounds, single-linked small tinplate, 180 pounds, 200 pounds of tinplate, 24 pounds, 26 pounds of large tinplate, or even 200 pounds of Hui Si tin, 200 pounds of cyan lead double-linked boards, etc., there are worries that the spot goods will be out of stock. Therefore, although the market wants to buy, it is affected by the thin circulation of goods, and it encounters walls everywhere and it is difficult to make a deal. The market situation has not been able to become lively, and it is mostly a situation of having a market but no market. Yesterday, the market price of each single-linked tinplate box was 1200 yuan, and each double-speed iron box was 2200 yuan, and Hui Si tin was 1750 yuan.

### Historical Traces of Public Utilities in Shanghai

— Bai Hong

After reading the article "The Import of Western Civilization into Shanghai" on the 14th, anyone with a historical hobby will be very interested. However, what is mentioned is only railways, telegraphs, telephones, and electric lights. Now, based on what is known, I will add some other historical traces of public utilities. The accusation of adding superfluous details is not counted.

Trams: The public concession opened on March 5, 1908 (34th year of Guangxu). The French concession opened earlier in February. At that time, the fee per stop was only one copper coin. The Nanshi system started operating in August 1914 (3rd year of the Republic of China).

Trolleybuses: The public concession started operating in November 1924 (13th year of the Republic of China). The French concession started operating in August 1926 (15th year of the Republic of China).

Public buses: The public concession also started operating in mid-October 1924 (13th year of the Republic of China). The French concession started operating in February 1927 (16th year of the Republic of China). Nanshi Zhabei started operating in June and November of the 17th year, respectively.

Double-decker buses started operating in the public concession on April 1, 1934.

Automatic telephones were installed in the concession starting in 1926 (15th year of the Republic of China). The urban area was changed in the 20th year.

International wireless telegraphs: The Zhenru Radio Station was completed in November 1930 (19th year of the Republic of China). In December, it communicated with Europe and the United States.

Civil aviation: Flights started in November 1929 (18th year of the Republic of China). The first route was Shanghai to Hankou.

### Listening to the Huangzhong Society's Broadcast

— Lawrence

The Shanghai Catholic authorities have recently been actively organizing various undertakings to promote the true meaning of Catholicism. At 6:30 PM on the 13th of this month, the Catholic Huangzhong Broadcasting Society broadcast speeches, songs, and plays at the Xaviai Road Cultural Radio Station. The author is purely a listener, and I will publish what I have heard to the newspaper to share with readers who have not listened.

The topic of the speech was "Catholicism and Science," and it was given by Professor Tu Renzheng of the Department of Physics and Chemistry of Aurora University. Professor Wang is rich in academics, and the content of his speech is quite valuable. Generally speaking, it is a historical story about the progress of European science and the relationship between Catholicism. When Professor Wang spoke, it was a bit like a reminder during meditation.

The singing was broadcast by the Ciyouhui Choir. According to what I know, the association regards music as a major subject, and the members are quite cultivated. The singing is so divine and humanized that it is not without the feeling of wanting to become immortal, especially the third song Magnum Agnum, which is sung by four parts.

The drama is a real story from a certain place in England, and the title of the play is "Starlight on the Lake," which is a short play with deep poetic meaning. This time the society broadcast, the piano at the beginning played quite appropriately, which set off the tranquility of Xingyi Lake. On the part of the drama actors, it is relatively naive: The first is the drama of "Shanghai Bai", which is not very palatable, and the second is the ups and downs of the drama words, because the relationship of using "Shanghai Bai" is difficult to show; and there are also many "Xu Jiagui Township tones" in the oral force surface, such as "It's me (me)", "It's you (you)", "It's him (him)", etc., which are quite unpleasant to listen to. In other aspects, such as using several different songs to accompany the feelings, the whistle when the ship arrives at the port, etc., are all applied very successfully, which is worth mentioning. In summary, the society's broadcast of dramas is still the first time, and it is worthy of admiration and praise to have such achievements. Judging from the observation of the radio drama scene, its achievements are also above the standard, which is undeniable. (Thanks for the reward)

### Riding the Storm Together

— He Jia Zhi

One or Two. Backyard Flowers

Wei Cheng and Huang Long returned to the Wang Shunxing Inn. The gambling game in the inn had already dispersed, and the energetic Wang Madman was not seen sitting at the account table. Wei Cheng closed the door and tapped the table lightly: tapping is to express anger, tapping lightly is to prevent other guests in the next room from hearing it. Then he sighed and said, "It's over, it's over." Huang Long said, "It's not for nothing, it won't be wrong, Cheng Bingzhun is that old woman's son." Wei Cheng said, "How can it not be for nothing? Cheng is indeed Chen's old lady's son, and Chen's old lady is indeed Cheng's old lady, and even if Chen's old lady denies it, it is trying to cover it up. But what about Cheng? Isn't Cheng dead? I want to avenge my parents, but the enemy is already dead. You say what a painful thing this is?" Huang Long stared at his eyes and clenched his fists, and the joints of his bones rattled, and smiled: "Maybe they are full of tricks: Cheng is really not dead, coaxing us, even if he is dead, let us die to kill him." Huang Long was also clever, and said the word "kill" lightly.

Wei Cheng groaned for a while and said, "This will not happen: you are daydreaming. How do they know that we have already discovered that Cheng is Chen's old lady's son? Since they don't know, there is no need to coax us, so I say you are daydreaming, and you are also neurotic." Huang Long nodded. While nodding, he hurriedly drew a white, shiny silver-like short knife from under the mattress, raised his trousers legs, stuffed it into the sock, and several blue veins suddenly burst out on his white face. Wei Cheng panicked and said, "What are you doing?" Huang Long said, "Don't ask me now, just sleep in the quilt, and I'll be back in a while. I often hear storytellers talk about warming wine and beheading Hua Xiong, and Guan Yunchang hadn't cooled a cup of wine when he came back from beheading Hua. I'll pour a cup of tea here now, and go and behead that old undead woman, and the tea will surely not cool. Don't plead for that old woman to me. I see that the old woman's breathing and breathing is not good for a few days. If I don't do it, when she dies, I won't be able to do anything about it, then it won't be good." After Huang Long finished speaking, he didn't wait for Wei Cheng to answer, opened the door and ran out. (244)

### A Retrospective of the Malayan Defeat (6)

— Notes of General Percival, Former Commander of the British Army in Malaya

February 10 (Tuesday), resolved to withdraw part of the 18th Division to reinforce the troops. By the morning of the 21st (Wednesday), most of the reserve forces had been deployed. Losing the Bukit Timah racecourse, we tried our best to maintain the safety of the positions near Adam Road. February 12 (Thursday), the entire 18th Division had to retreat from the northern region. Also: (1) The 11th Indian Division retreated from the naval base area. (2) The troops in the Strong Base and Southeast Coast area also retreated on February 12 (Thursday). In this way, by the 13th (Friday), new positions had been built in the areas around the city of Singapore, Karang airfield, Bedadari, MacRitchie Reservoir, Adam, Road, and Alexander. February 14 (Saturday), due to bombing and shelling, the water pipes were almost completely destroyed, and the water supply in Singapore was extremely difficult. By the morning of the 15th (Sunday), the water supply situation deteriorated further, causing experts to declare that there was only one day and night of water supply left. This was the biggest reason we decided to surrender on the 15th.

Air Situation

The above review barely touches on the air situation. Not only the British army, but also the Japanese authorities did not understand this situation. Britain could not send the necessary air force to Malaya because it had other tasks in other areas. From the first few days, the Japanese army gained complete air superiority and never lost it until the end. This was a very troublesome thing for us, especially in coastal operations, we could not act freely, and we were not afraid that information would be leaked to the Japanese army. Also, operations in the Singapore area were also significantly affected. That is to say, the repair of airfields, the operation of shipyards, etc. were very inconvenient.

(Note) Because the air force is independent of the army, specialized matters concerning the air force will not be discussed here.

Reasons for the Japanese Army's Victory

The biggest factor in the Japanese army's success lies in the speed of its advance. This speed was caused by the following reasons. (1) The Japanese army has the possibility of living in this place for longer than the US military. (2) Because of the above reasons, the Japanese army does not have to rely entirely on road traffic. (3) The Japanese army can quickly pass through obstacles such as rivers and swamps, and can quickly repair damage. (4) The Japanese army is full of endurance. (End)
