### Britain and the United States are Still Attempting to Reconcile British-Indian Relations; Gandhi Still Intends to Use Fasting as a Means to Strive for Indian Independence and Freedom

Stockholm, 26th (Domei News Agency) - According to a report from New York, Britain and the United States have again asked Chiang Kai-shek to mediate in India. Chiang has dispatched a special envoy to India to request Mahatma Gandhi to avoid launching a disobedience movement.

Lisbon, 27th (Domei News Agency) - According to a report from Bombay, Gandhi published an article in Harijan, titled "Fasting in Non-Violent Action," stating that the struggle they wanted to avoid at all costs was one that they had to launch.

If violent actions and stubborn popular riots were to occur in the struggle with the authorities and with the people, then fasting would be an effective remedy.

### Italy and Japan Will Open Regular Air Routes; Italian Plane Visiting Japan Returns Home

Rome, 26th (Havas Agency) - An Italian plane, which flew from here to Tokyo, Japan, two weeks ago for a friendly visit, has already flown back here. According to the plane's crew, the plane departed from Rome, stopping only briefly at a location in the eastern Mediterranean and a Japanese base. It then landed at Tokyo airfield. The plane's fuselage was streamlined and equipped with electric heating. When the crew was at an altitude of 12,000 feet, they used stored oxygen to help them breathe. The plane was also equipped with a new type of Eastern climate measuring instrument, as wireless reports of the climate have become virtually impossible since the start of the war. The trip to Tokyo took four days each way, and the plane stayed in Tokyo for twelve days. Italian officials discussed the possibility of opening regular air routes between the two countries with Japanese representatives. Good weather was encountered on both the outbound and return flights. The arrival in Tokyo and the departure from Tokyo were kept strictly secret. The Italian officials were warmly welcomed by their Japanese counterparts on this trip.

Rome, 27th (Haitong News Agency) - After completing the flight to and from Rome and Tokyo, Italian Air Force Lieutenant Colonel Moscati told reporters that it is now possible to open a regular air service between the capitals of Italy and Japan. Passengers can fly by plane without danger. The flight led by Moscati took four days each way. Details of the trip cannot be disclosed due to military reasons. The Italian Aviation Ministry was extremely cautious in preparing for the technical aspects of this flight. Meteorological reports from recent years were carefully studied to determine the route of the flight and to have a clear understanding of how the weather changes each month. Regarding the seasonal winds in Southeast Asia, Dutch and French airlines suspend air service to Batavia and the Dutch East Indies for about two months each summer. The experience gained from this flight shows that there is no danger. Our plane flew very high, and there was often thin ice on the wings, indicating the coldness of the high-altitude climate. In order to determine the position of our plane, we have special experience in observing the stars. By just seeing one star or the location of the sun, we can know where our plane is within one minute. Checking the plane is the most important task. No parts failed during this long flight between Europe and Asia, indicating the thoroughness of the inspection. Moscati and his subordinates talked in detail about the flight. It was said that because the flight was very high, a lot of gas was needed. When flying over a danger zone, pilots should not eat too much, but the food was very good. Four of the five pilots were on duty at any given time, and one was resting. The plane was equipped with safety parachutes and weapons, but no enemy planes were seen along the way, so there was no danger. Moscati and his subordinates stayed in secret accommodations in Japan. In a certain capital, they wore civilian clothes to avoid being noticed. They stayed in Tokyo for twelve days, and the Japanese side treated them cordially. Japanese Prime Minister Tojo received Moscati and his party. Moscati read a letter from Italian Prime Minister Mussolini. When they returned to Italy, they carried a letter from General Abe to the Italian Prime Minister as a token of friendship.

### British People Demonstrate to Urge the Opening of a Second Battlefield; Minister of Labor Explains the Pros and Cons to Miners; American Officials Confer on the War Situation in Britain

Stockholm, 27th (Haitong News Agency) - According to news from London, thousands of people held a demonstration in Trafalgar Square in London yesterday, demanding the immediate establishment of a second front. The main speakers were the editor of the Communist newspaper Daily Worker, Bevan, a left-wing representative of the Labour Party, and Guest. Bevan accused the British government of refusing to open a second front, which led to the collapse of the domestic front. In other words, this is helping Hitler.

London, 26th (Havas Agency) - Minister of Labor Bevan recently gave a speech to miners in Mendes, stating that demanding the opening of a second front is precisely what Germany wants. The Labour Party and left-wing groups in the country have made this request, which has created a bad atmosphere. Although opening a second front can help the Soviet Union, it is not the best way to wage war. Therefore, friends of the Soviet Union should not force us to do this. He firmly believes that Britain is capable of defending Egypt, and the Soviet army will not collapse. He hopes that they will not talk too much about the second front and will give their full support to the government. If everyone can fulfill their duties, the arrival of victory will be earlier than we expected. At the same time, more than 60,000 people gathered in Trafalgar Square in London, listening quietly to the speeches of labor leaders demanding the immediate opening of a second front. Dr. Harlan, a member of the Labour Party, said that the result of opening a second front may prompt the enemy to invade Britain, but the British people have already completed the defense of the British Isles and are prepared for any eventuality. The audience responded with applause.

### American Senators Advocate Building Transport Aircraft

Washington, 26th (Havas Agency) - Oklahoma Democratic Senator T. Lee told reporters today that the number of ships lost by the Allied countries in recent weeks is staggering.

These aircraft would be sufficient to replace ships and transport military supplies overseas. Kaiser has proposed converting nine domestic shipyards into aircraft factories to manufacture 5,000 70-ton jumbo jets, but this plan has been opposed by military authorities.

### Eighty Divisions of Soviet Troops Transferred Southward, Determined to Defend the Caucasus, Regarding the Black Sea Coast as the Only Lifeline, Unprecedentedly Fierce Fighting in the Lower Don Area

Allied Press dispatch from Stockholm, Sweden, on the 25th, citing a Moscow dispatch from the U.S. International News Service, stated that the Soviet side believes that the complete retreat of Timoshenko's main forces and the huge damage suffered in the Donets Basin war make it difficult to defend the lower reaches of the Don River. According to some sources, defenses are being actively strengthened on the southeastern bank of the lower Don River. Under the command of Marshal Putilov, eighty divisions of Soviet reserve troops have been urgently dispatched to the area to reinforce it.

Allied Press dispatch from Lisbon on the 26th, citing a London dispatch, stated that after the German army swept up the remaining Soviet troops in the Rostov area, they continued to attack the Soviet positions on the south bank of the Don River on the 25th, with fierce fighting all day. They also crossed the Don River at two locations, the eastern and southern sides of Rostov, eliminating Soviet resistance and beginning an offensive toward the Caucasus. German reinforcements have already arrived in this area, with a total force of about 600,000, possessing 2,000 tanks and 2,000 aircraft.

Haitong News Agency dispatch from Berlin on the 27th stated that German military officials revealed that the German army had occupied the city of Bataisk on the southern bank of the lower Don River. The city was heavily fortified, but it was still captured by the German army. Soviet troops continued to attack the Voronezh bridgehead, but were repelled by the German army. Thirty-one Soviet tanks were destroyed.

Havas News Agency dispatch from Stockholm, Sweden, on the 26th stated that, according to sources, the battle situation in the Rostov and Tsimlyansk areas (between Rostov and Stalingrad) has been exceptionally fierce in recent days. Most military experts believe that the decisive battle this summer may unfold in this area. As for the German offensive toward Stalingrad, it is likely a feint, aimed at containing the Red Army and preventing it from attending to the Caucasus front. At the same time, the Soviet Union is deeply aware of the gravity of the situation. "Pravda" published an article yesterday on the occasion of the Soviet Navy Day, urging the Red Army to spare no sacrifice in stopping the German army, stating, "The enemy is now threatening our naval bases. If the enemy's advance is not stopped, the future of our fleet is unthinkable. We are willing to abandon thousands of miles of grassland to the enemy, but defending our coastline is a matter of life and death. The German side has concentrated a large army of 600,000, 2,000 tanks, and a large number of aircraft in the Rostov area. If this army attacks the rear of our Taman Peninsula garrison, the Black Sea will soon become an inland sea. If the German army conquers the Caucasus, they will inevitably feel greatly emboldened. At this juncture, everyone must understand the situation and realize that only with great military strength and the greatest personal courage can we reverse the current crisis."

Havas News Agency dispatch from Stockholm, Sweden, on the 27th stated that the battle situation in the lower Don River is reminiscent of the situation in mid-September last year when the German army crossed the Dnieper River at great sacrifice but was intercepted by the Red Army. Currently, the German army has secured four bridgeheads on the south bank of the Don River, two of which are to the east and west of Rostov, and two are between Tsimlyanskaya and Rostov. Fighting continues on both sides of the river from Azov to Tsimlyanskaya, with air forces playing a major role. According to Moscow, the German forces in the area include one armored corps, ten infantry divisions, and 600 aircraft. Their operational plan is to expand the occupied area on the south bank of the Don River as a starting point for a large-scale offensive. The Soviet side is trying to prevent the German army from completing this plan. If the Soviet troops fail to recover all the German bridgeheads within a few days and retreat further south, it will be meaningless. From the current situation, a large number of Soviet troops are concentrated on the south bank of the Don River, perhaps able to form a long snake formation to block the German advance southward. After fierce fighting, the city of Rostov has become a pile of rubble. The Gorky Theater and the National Museum have been destroyed by artillery fire. The Sneloye factory, which originally employed 26,000 workers, has withdrawn with its machinery to a location to the south. As for the Soviet fleet, it is now concentrated in the port of Eisk, about 70 miles southwest of Rostov.

Havas News Agency dispatch from Moscow on the 26th stated that the Soviet authorities recently released a war report acknowledging that the German army had reached the city of Tsimlyanskaya on the Don River (about seventy miles east of Rostov), stating that, "On the 26th of this month, Soviet troops fought strongly on the Voronezh, Tsimlyanskaya, Novocherkassk, and Rostov lines. There were no major changes on other lines."

### Reports of Landing Troops Being Surrounded on the Southern Coast of the Gulf of Kalinsk

Havas News Agency dispatch from a location on the Ukrainian border on the 26th stated that fierce fighting on the Eastern Front is in full swing. As of now, the front lines between the German and Soviet armies are roughly as follows: On the Voronezh-Kursk line, Soviet troops are launching powerful attacks from time to time, but they have not yet developed into a general offensive. The reason for this is probably that the troops under the command of General Zhukov, the commander of the forward forces in that area, are not numerous. The main force of the Red Army is now concentrated around Moscow, where military activity has been very active in recent days. Although the German authorities are not very clear about the Soviet Union's operational plans for central Russia, another attack on Moscow is highly likely. As long as the threat to Moscow is not eliminated, the Soviet authorities will not dare to disperse their forces to local battles. The Soviet troops recently launched an offensive in the Bryansk area, perhaps only as a diversionary action. The fighting between Voronezh and the Don River is not as fierce as it was a few days ago. The Soviet side's claim that the German bridgeheads on the left bank of the Don River have been recovered by the Red Army is still strongly denied by the German side. The German troops within the Don River bend are preparing to launch an offensive against Stalingrad. German and Soviet troops are engaged in heavy artillery battles on both banks of the Don River. The German air force is also heavily bombing Red Army concentration points between the Don and Volga Rivers. The German troops that crossed the Don River in the lower reaches of the Don have made contact with the troops that arrived on the north bank of the Don, and have gained five or six bridgeheads between Kotelnikovo and the Gulf of Kalinsk, and are expanding their gains. The German army seems to be planning to form a continuous line of defense between Rostov and Stalingrad, but has encountered considerable difficulties. The reason is that a part of the Soviet troops crossed the Don River last night and gained bridgeheads at Lisk and Nikolayevskaya. As for the German troops in the Rostov area, they are advancing toward the Rostov Bay of Azov. According to unconfirmed reports, landing troops on the southern coast of the Gulf of Kalinsk have been surrounded.

### The Kuban Plains Become a Battlefield, German Troops Continue to Send Reinforcements

Haitong News Agency dispatch from Berlin on the 27th stated that the troops of German General von Kleist, taking advantage of the momentum of the capture of Rostov, crossed the Don River and advanced toward the Caucasus. Although the Soviet army launched a fierce counterattack, it has not been able to build a solid line of defense on the south bank of the Don River. The wheat fields of the Kuban Plains have become the battlefield for German tank units. The German army is sending fresh troops to the Taganrog area, and the transportation of ammunition and supplies is very convenient. The Soviet army is having great difficulty with supplies after the railway between Stalingrad and Rostov was cut off. German aircraft have bombed the lower reaches of the Volga River, and the war is almost pressing on that area. Soviet attacks in the Voronezh and Leningrad areas, attempting to divert German forces, have been repelled by the German army.

Haitong News Agency dispatch from Berlin on the 27th stated that authoritative sources here declared last night that the previous night, German aircraft formations went to Middlesbrough in several batches, broke through its defenses, and then bombed the important munitions factories there, with many hits and fires breaking out.

Haitong News Agency dispatch from Berlin on the 27th stated that, according to the German High Command, the German crossing of the mouth of the Don River was a great achievement, because the Don River Delta is seven kilometers wide, with islands and swamps scattered throughout, which is conducive to defense. The Slovakian troops fought very bravely, and the German aircraft provided very effective assistance. Bombers and dive bombers constantly pursued the Soviet troops south of Rostov. Ships at the mouth of the Don River were also bombed, and one gunboat caught fire after being hit. Several artillery batteries east of Rostov were destroyed. The enemy attempted to build a defense line on the Don River bend west of the Don River. The enemy repeatedly counterattacked with the assistance of artillery units, but were all repelled. The German army has broken through the enemy's position south of the Seversky Donets River. The Soviet Union sent reinforcements to block the German advance, but was unsuccessful. At one location, Soviet troops launched an attack with the assistance of tanks. The German army assisted with dive bombers and destroyed forty tanks.

### Egyptian War Enters Second Phase, Both Sides Actively Preparing for a Major Battle, Axis Air Force Bombs Port Said

Haitong News Agency dispatch from Milan on the 27th stated that "Il Popolo d'Italia" pointed out that Prime Minister Mussolini personally comforted the North African army and predicted that the Italian army would launch the second phase of the war in Egypt with the German army. Although it is not known when it will be launched, judging from the overall situation, both sides have been actively preparing for battle, and an outbreak sooner or later is inevitable.

Havas News Agency dispatch from a location on the Libyan border on the 26th stated that the Egyptian front has been quite quiet for the past two days. Both sides have only scout teams and artillery activities, without any large-scale land battles. According to the latest news from the front, both sides are currently engaged in resupply. It is difficult to predict when the major battle will break out at this time. It is reported that yesterday, German engineers ignored the British army's artillery bombardment and continued to lay landmines in front of the British army's position. The British side said that the British army had set up a solid position on the Ruweisat Ridge (about ten miles from the coast), which is a serious threat to Rommel's line of defense. Also, in the Qattara Depression area, armored units were unable to move due to a sudden sandstorm, so there was only infantry fighting.

Allied Press dispatch from Lisbon on the 26th, Reuters dispatch from Cairo, stated that a large formation of Axis air forces bombed Port Said, the entrance to the Suez Canal, on the 24th.

Havas News Agency dispatch from Rome on the 26th stated that it has been learned that General Rommel, the commander-in-chief of the German army in North Africa, recently awarded the Iron Cross First Class to the commander of the Italian Trento Division, which is currently fighting in Egypt.

### The Soviet Union Invents a Secret Weapon, Effective Against Tanks

He was awarded the Stalin Prize in April of this year and has now been promoted to Major General of the Air Force Mechanical Corps.

### Finnish War Report

Havas News Agency dispatch from Helsinki, Finland, on the 26th, the General Headquarters issued a communique today stating that yesterday, the vanguard units of the Red Army repeatedly attempted to launch an offensive in the Karelian Isthmus, but were repelled by our army each time. Our artillery also bombarded enemy positions very successfully. In a certain area of the Oinous Isthmus, the enemy attacked at night, but was also repelled by our army. As for other areas, there was no major event to report other than intense artillery battles. In the past 24 hours, our side shot down three Soviet aircraft.

### Allied Ships Sunk, Nine Vessels

Havas News Agency dispatch from Berlin on the 26th stated that, according to official news, German naval forces sunk a total of nine enemy ships in the past 24 hours, including one Soviet gunboat sunk in the Don River, three Soviet barges sunk in the Volga River, and one troop transport ship and four ships sunk in the North Sea, the Atlantic Ocean, and the Mediterranean Sea.

Haitong News Agency dispatch from Lisbon on the 26th, Allied News Agency, the American "Fortune" magazine stated that the ratio of Allied ships sunk to new ships in April of this year was four to one, that is, for every four ships sunk, only one ship could be replenished. Therefore, if the Allied ship tonnage problem cannot be solved, the American armament production is in vain.

Havas News Agency dispatch from Lisbon, Portugal, on the 26th, The British ship "Meteor" was torpedoed and sunk on the 5th of this month about 200 miles from the Portuguese Azores Islands in the Atlantic Ocean. Twenty-seven of its sailors were rescued by a Portuguese dispatch boat and arrived here last night. According to reports, after the "Meteor" was wrecked on the 5th, these people escaped in lifeboats and drifted at sea for about three weeks before being discovered by a Portuguese reconnaissance plane, which dispatched a dispatch boat to rescue them. The remaining two lifeboats have been missing for a long time and are presumed to have been lost. Also, a Portuguese destroyer rescued 109 passengers of the ship a few days ago. According to the rescued people, the situation was chaotic when the ship was torpedoed. Some people even committed suicide before the ship sank to avoid the suffering of drifting. One man had already boarded a lifeboat, but suddenly went mad and jumped into the sea and died.

### Mysterious Egypt (4)

Egypt has a total of six oases, with Bahariya producing the most. The northernmost Siwa, anciently known as Jupiter Ammon, was once invaded by Alexander, but is now occupied by Italian forces. Siwa is geographically extremely important, located between Libya and Egypt, and also close to the coast. It takes twelve days to reach here by camel train from the southwestern mouth of the Delta, or from Mersa Matruh, a small port along the Mediterranean coast. There is also a road passing through Siwa between Cairo and Jarabub in Libya. Therefore, Siwa controls a vital point between Egypt, Libya, and the Mediterranean. The population here is only over six thousand, and the residents all make a living by growing dates and olives. The annual export of dates is valued at over 200,000 francs, and the annual export of olives is valued at 150,000 francs. The secondary oasis is Fayoum, near the Nile River, which has a canal, conceived by Joseph, the son of Job in ancient times, that connects with the Nile River, so the water conservancy is very good. In recent years, there have been many improvements in irrigation, plus the connection of Lake Qarun (anciently known as Lake Moeris), so it is the most fertile place in Egypt, producing cotton, rice, alfalfa, and grains. Grape trees, fig trees, and rose trees are also planted in large quantities. Recently, some people have also been growing reeds there to make mats, but the cultivation of sugar cane has not yet been successful.

We know that living things cannot do without water, but it does not rain in Egypt all year round, so how do people live there? And Egypt has the highest population density and the most fertile cultivated land in the world, which is amazing. This place is the Nile River basin, known to the world, which is the birthplace of world culture and the lifeline of the Egyptian people.

The Nile River originates from Lake Tana in Abyssinia, passes through Anglo-Egyptian Sudan, and reaches the Delta in Egypt to the sea. Although it does not rain in Egypt all year round, the upper reaches of the Nile River in East Africa are full of high mountains and abundant rainfall, which causes the rainwater to converge in the Nile River and enter Egypt.

For thousands of years, the Nile River has had two regular floods every year in spring and autumn, which the Egyptians have used for agricultural irrigation. According to ancient methods, they built many embankments along the Nile River that were parallel and perpendicular to the river, with square ponds formed between the embankments. The ponds varied in size, some only two or three acres, while others were over two thousand acres. The embankments were usually up to three meters high. During the flood season, the river water flowed into the ponds, and then water pipes were used to draw water from the ponds to the surrounding fields. Flooding usually occurs in mid-April, and in years with abundant water, it can be used until October, which is enough for farmers to irrigate; if there is little water, they have to abandon part of the fields. This method is the oldest, and the Egyptians have mostly followed it for thousands of years, and it is still used in the south.

As for the lower reaches of the Nile River in the north, new methods are mostly adopted, which was promoted by Mehemet Ali, a great contributor to Egypt. In 1833, he built a large water gate on the upper reaches of the Delta, with channels on the gate that could freely increase or decrease the water flow. This method was adopted by all the farmers in the Delta and most of the people in the central part by the end of the nineteenth century.

The irrigation method used most recently was invented by the Englishman Viscount Samuel Baker in 1861. In 1902, he built a huge dam in Aswan, northern Egypt. The dam is more than two thousand meters wide and has 360 fire holes on it with diameters between two and seven meters. In recent years, it has been widened by 113 meters and the capacity has also increased by half. The length is 295,000 meters. When the river floods starting on December 1, the holes are closed one by one; and after a hundred days, around March, the water in the sluice is full, and the flood season also stops. After that, the accumulated water is released as needed. When it comes to July, it is the time of the Nile River's flood season again, and the water can still be accumulated. This cycle goes on and on, plus the construction of other ditches and canals, the addition of water pumps and water lifting machines, Egypt, although isolated from the God of Thunder and the Rain Master, can also never lack water.

In addition to water conservancy, the Nile River is also very important in transportation. It is 3,675 kilometers long and connects the northeastern corner of Africa. The ships that travel on it all year round are mostly Arab-style sailing ships of the natives. There are also small steamers and motorboats in the lower reaches, but they cannot navigate in the upper reaches.

All production is indeed in the Nile River basin, and Egypt's famous scenic spots, historical sites, important towns and cities are all located here. If you take a tour along the Nile River, you will definitely say involuntarily, this is really a huge museum!

Egypt also has a large river, the Suez Canal, which connects the three continents of Europe, Asia, and Africa. The Suez Canal is 164,000 meters long; the surface of the river is 58 meters to 70 meters wide, the riverbed was originally 22 meters wide, but has now been increased to 45 meters; the depth has also been increased from 8 meters to 15 meters. It takes 13 hours for ships to pass through, and each passenger has to pay a transit tax of US$2.00, and ordinary merchant ships pay a transit tax of US$10,000. There is not much scenery along the way. Looking out from the cabin, you can only see a piece of sandy land on both sides, with few traces of people.

A village on the Delta, with picturesque scenery, who would have thought that this is a rainless land?

### The Weather is Extremely Hot, the Whole City is Boiling, Yesterday it Exceeded 100 Degrees, An Unprecedented Drought Since 1935, Drought and Lack of Rain Hinder Crops

Strict Quarantine Added to the Suburbs Yesterday Due to the Cholera Epidemic

Yesterday, the weather in this port reached its extreme heat, with the temperature exceeding 100 degrees Fahrenheit, breaking the highest temperature record since 1935. Our reporter records the details below.

Highest Temperature is 100.8 Degrees

Yesterday, this port was invaded by a heat wave, and the whole city was boiling. According to the Xujiahui Observatory, the highest temperature rose to 100.8 degrees Fahrenheit (38.2 degrees Celsius), which is the highest temperature record since 1935. No wonder the heat was unbearable. Judging from yesterday's weather, it is unlikely that today's heat will decrease. The highest temperature the day before yesterday was also 99.1 degrees Fahrenheit. Due to the drought and lack of rain, crops in the suburbs have been affected. Especially during the period of field irrigation, water-carrying in the countryside has been extremely busy.

Sudden Increase in Patients in Epidemic Hospitals

The asphalt on the roads was steamed and roasted by the scorching sun yesterday, and much of it melted. The Shanghai Epidemic Hospital, the Zhenxin Epidemic Hospital, the Isolation Hospital of the Public Works Department (all in the central district), the Second Emergency Epidemic Hospital (western district), the Tongrenhui Infectious Disease Hospital (northern district), the Chinese Epidemic Hospital (Hongkou), and the Guangci Hospital (Nanshi) saw a sudden increase in patients seeking treatment for epidemics yesterday. The summer health of citizens is under serious threat.

Second Injection is Deemed Necessary

The English-language "Shanghai Times" reports that the second week of the second anti-epidemic campaign in the two settlements began yesterday (27th). According to reports, nearly 140,000 people received cholera vaccinations during the week from Monday to Saturday last week. It is said that in these two areas, an average of about 20,000 people are vaccinated every day. According to an official from the Shanghai Health Department, he is not satisfied with the number of more than 20,000 vaccinated people last week. The number of people vaccinated daily often exceeded 60,000 in May of this year, so at least the same number of people should be vaccinated every day during this period of severe cholera. Since the time of the first cholera case was discovered in the first week of July, it has been more than three months since the first injection time for citizens of this port. The authorities have long advised them to carry out the second injection as soon as possible. The Shanghai Epidemic Prevention Committee, namely the Health Departments of the two settlements, began to inject citizens with the second dose of vaccination on July 15, and its free injection points also officially reopened starting last week.

Stricter Exit Verification Started Yesterday

The Tokyo Japanese Health Association attaches great importance to the rampant cholera in Shanghai. The authorities in various districts of this port issued notices that citizens must prepare personal vaccination certificates before receiving citizen cards, various ration cards, and other medical certificates. Also, the Japanese authorities have now stipulated that when going to Hongkou via the bridge and going to the northern district of the Public Concession, vaccination certificates must be checked. Its final epidemic prevention step was also notified yesterday for implementation, that is, when taking a bus from the China-Central China Bus Company in the suburbs, you must first show your epidemic prevention certificate.

### Medical Professionals Can Apply for Emergency Treatment Pass

Medical professionals in this city, in view of the fact that there are frequent terror drills held within the boundary, which indirectly hinders outpatient treatment, intend to jointly apply to the authorities for "emergency treatment passes." Yesterday, the Shanghai Medical Specialists Federation issued a special notice to all doctors, saying, "Regarding the application for 'emergency treatment passes' for medical professionals, as instructed by the Public Concession Baojia Guidance Department, doctors in the Public Concession who wish to receive the above-mentioned passes should go to No. 25 Chihama Road, to this federation, between July 28 and August 3 to collect forms. These forms must be filled out and submitted before August 6, so that they can be compiled and applied for."

### English Residents Along the Yangtze River Come to Shanghai to Await Evacuation

According to the English-language "The Times," the Ryuta Maru, expected to arrive here on August 2nd, will carry evacuated residents to Lourenço Marques. The list of evacuees will include English residents from various inland counties, who will arrive this week. In addition to the eleven people, including the British Consul Gibson from Nanjing, at least three more groups of residents are expected to arrive in Shanghai in the coming weeks. One group of fifty people is from Hankou, and there are also twenty from Jiujiang and fourteen from Hangzhou. Most of these people are missionaries who sought refuge in inland counties due to the Pacific War. The English residents who have already arrived in Shanghai are residing in the Columbia Country Club, which used to be a gathering place for English residents. Diplomatic and consular officials are mostly staying at the Cathay Hotel and the China Hotel. The Ryuta Maru, arriving from Japan, is scheduled to arrive here on August 2nd and is scheduled to leave with 9,000 English residents after 24 hours. The second ship evacuating residents, the Kamakura Maru, is expected to arrive in Shanghai on August 14th and is scheduled to transport evacuated foreigners to Lourenço Marques on the 16th. Swiss consulate and Japanese officials will be assigned to care for them on these two ships, just as they did during the previous evacuation by the Conte Verde. It is reported that the number of residents selected for evacuation from other cities will exceed the number of residents evacuated from this city. As for the former Shanghai Municipal Council staff, their evacuation will depend on discussions between Tokyo and London.

### The Iron Gates of the Nanshi District Are Planned to Be Fully Opened

In the Nanshi area bordering the French Concession, in addition to the iron gates at Xinkai River, Old North Gate, Xinqiao Street, Nanyang Bridge, and Xie Bridge, which have already been opened for passage, many others are still closed. It is now known that the relevant authorities have reached an agreement with the French police authorities to fully open all the iron gates. This measure is expected to be implemented in early next month.

### Young Woman Dies by Poisoning, Suspected of Being Oppressed, Husband Suspected and Arrested

The day before yesterday (the 26th), at around 3:00 PM, a young woman named Xu (27 years old), a resident of No. 3, Lane 100, Baker Road, suddenly committed suicide at home by taking poison. After being discovered, she was rushed to Guangren Hospital for emergency treatment, but she died at 5:30 PM that afternoon. It is now known that after the incident, the Zhabei Police Station sent officers to investigate. At that time, a note with the words "Forced me to commit suicide" was found on the table, pressed under a teacup. Next to the cup was a kitchen knife. Judging from the circumstances, it appeared to be a case of forced suicide. Because her husband, Li Guoxi (27 years old) from Ningbo, was not at home at the time, her younger brother, Xu Linsheng, waited at home. When Li returned home at around 11:00 PM, Xu took Li to the police station. The police station transferred him to the court yesterday morning. Li denied instigating the suicide, saying that the relationship between the couple was usually harmonious. He said he only learned of the suicide after returning home. However, Xu claimed that the deceased had often been abused and that neighbors could be asked for verification. The note with the words "Forced me to commit suicide" suggests that she was coerced into taking her own life. The case is still under investigation, so the hearing has been postponed.

### Embezzlement of Subsidized Flour, Sentenced to One Year Imprisonment Each

Jia Ruwang (45 years old, from Zhenjiang), Chairman of the Shanghai Cooked Food and Fried Cake Industry Professional Association at No. 83 Mai Di in the French Concession, colluded with committee members Wu Jun, Luo Ziliang, Jiang Shunkang, and others this spring to embezzle and sell hundreds of bags of flour issued by the French Concession Food Evaluation Committee to the association's major cake stalls at a subsidized price of 50 yuan per bag. Jia and others only distributed a small amount and secretly embezzled and sold most of it, raising the price and dividing the profits. This was discovered by members who had not received flour, who jointly reported it to the French Concession Bureau. The police sent detectives to arrest Jia, Wu, Luo, and Jiang for investigation, found evidence, and sent them to be detained. The case has been concluded, and the four defendants were brought to court yesterday to announce the verdict. Jia Ruzhuang, Wu Jun, Luo Ziliang, and Jiang Shunkang were jointly convicted of embezzlement and sentenced to one year imprisonment each. After the verdict, they were returned to custody.

Summer Resort

### Zhang Garden Swimming Pool with Perfect Equipment

Swimming is the best full-body exercise—especially in the hot summer. Swimming was a very naive sport in China six or seven years ago, but in recent years it has made amazing progress, which is a very gratifying fact. You see, in every swimming pool, it used to be only foreigners who went swimming, but now it is full of young Chinese men and women!

### Starting with Yang Xiuqiong

Readers will surely remember Ms. Xiuqiong, the "Mermaid," who stood out in the National Games. She was the center of attention, giving the audience a fresh feeling, and captivated many young men and women. It can be said that the swimming craze among young people in our country officially began at that time.

Swimming is especially popular in Shanghai, but there are too few public swimming pools. This summer, only a few, such as Zhang Garden and the YMCA, are open. Among them, Zhang Garden is the largest in scale and has the most perfect equipment, so water sports enthusiasts gather here.

One hot morning, I went to Zhang Garden for a tour and was warmly received by Mr. Fang Heming, the director of the garden. We talked on the sofa by the window upstairs—

### An Overview of Zhang Garden's Facilities

"Zhang Garden Swimming Pool is now open from 9:00 AM to 7:00 PM. There are two types of prices: weekdays and holidays. Weekdays are 4 yuan in the morning and 5 yuan in the afternoon. Holidays are 5 yuan in the morning and 7 yuan in the afternoon." According to Mr. Fang, the number of people who come to the garden to swim is about 500 or 600 on weekdays and about 1,000 on holidays. There is a turnstile at the entrance. Visitors must pass through the turnstile to enter, and the turnstile is engraved with numbers. The integer of visitors in a day can be calculated from the numbers on the turnstile. This is not only convenient and meticulous for calculation, but also prevents ticket collectors from cheating and engaging in favoritism.

"Zhang Garden has three main parts for the safety of tourists: 1. Rescue - There are Chinese and Western rescue teams stationed by the pool to provide rescue work. 2. Medicine - All tourists receive free eye drops after swimming to prevent germs. 3. Testing - The pool water is tested daily by the Shanghai Municipal Council Health Department, and the garden also has two full-time chemists to test the pool water at any time to keep the pool water clean."

"In addition, three important parts have been set up for the convenience of tourists: 1. Changing rooms - There are separate changing rooms for men and women, divided into ordinary and special types. The ordinary ones are free, while the special ones charge a rental fee of one yuan for the lockers. The women's changing rooms have one room per person, and the shower rooms are also one room per person. 2. Rental items - If tourists do not have swimming suits, they can rent them from the rental item office. The clothes are divided into wool and cotton, and the rental fees vary. 3. Luggage storage - If tourists have luggage that is inconvenient to carry in, they can hand it over to the luggage storage office for safekeeping. This is set up for the convenience of tourists."

"There are two water filtration machines in the pool that work all day, filtering the water every twelve hours, and chemical agents such as bleaching powder, chlorine gas, and calcium are added to keep the pool water clean forever. After 7:00 PM every night, sixteen workers clean the pool. After so many procedures, the cleanliness of the pool water is of course beyond doubt."

"The pool has a capacity of 500,000 gallons, is 50 meters long, 9 feet deep at the deep end, and 3 feet deep at the shallow end..."

The reporter asked, "Isn't the ticket price too expensive?"

Mr. Fang smiled and replied, "The ticket price seems a bit expensive, but this year the prices of all kinds of goods have risen dozens of times, especially chemical agents such as bleaching powder and chlorine gas, which have risen more than a hundred times, and there is even no place to buy them with money, so it is not too expensive when calculated like this."

"In addition to the swimming pool, are the theater and restaurant also owned by your company?" the reporter asked again.

"No, Zhang Garden only manages the swimming pool ourselves. The rest, such as the theater and restaurant, are leased to others and have nothing to do with us. They just use the name of Zhang Garden."

### Fun in the Water World

From a high place, I looked down at the pool water woven with dynamic ripples, and the men and women wearing various swimming suits were playing and chasing each other in the water world. We saw their mysterious smiles and charming anger after they surfaced from the bottom of the water, and we could guess how happy they were in the water world!

Beginners hid in the shallow end of the pool, moving their hands and feet to kick the water, showing extremely envious expressions to experienced swimmers. There were also people watching from the sidelines who, although they were eager for the fun of life in the water, did not have the courage to go into the water, with a feeling of "envying the fish while standing by the pool"!

Diving, backstroke, breaststroke, etc., in short, the fun and excitement in the water world are enough! "C"

### Dr. Qu Yahong Passes Away

Dr. Qu Yahong, wife of Dr. Fan Shouyuan and second daughter of Dr. Qu Shaoheng, was determined to study medicine from a young age. After graduating from Tongde Medical College in 1935, she went to Tokyo Imperial University to specialize in obstetrics and gynecology. After completing her studies in 1937, she returned to China and served as the director of obstetrics and gynecology at Shoumin Hospital in this city. With a strong family background in medicine, she was worthy of being a good doctor. Moreover, Dr. Qu was humble and enthusiastic, and all who sought medical treatment praised her. Recently, she suffered from appendicitis after giving birth. Although she underwent surgery, she eventually died at Zhongde Hospital at 8:00 PM on the 27th of this month due to a weak heart and lack of physical strength. Relatives and friends mourned her death. The body has now been moved to the Shanghai Funeral Home on Xujiahui Road, and a grand memorial service will be held at 10:00 AM on the 29th. Another doctor has been lost, which is a pity.

### Community Service

Lost and Found: Our hospital found a rainproof straw hat and a black leather wallet at the end of the show on the 21st of this month. Please contact Mr. Tang of the General Affairs Section on the second floor of our hospital within ten days to claim it. If it is not claimed after the deadline, the proceeds from the auction will be transferred to a charitable organization by our hospital. Hua Dahua Theater General Affairs Department

Thank you to Mr. Ji Tingpu for donating 120 bottles of Pude Association's medicine for heatstroke. The editor

Yesterday, the newspaper's distribution time was 6:40 PM.

### A Cool World Under the Blazing Sun

The left picture (above) is a bird's-eye view of the Zhang Hei Garden swimming pool, and (below) are tourists sitting idly by the pool, all looking relaxed and comfortable, sitting and lying down at ease, and their state of removing troubles and enjoying themselves is enviable.

### Gu Fei's Song Dynasty Painting

Ms. Gu Fei (Mo Fei) of Nanhui's Song Dynasty paintings are highly praised by the Shanghai Chinese painting community. The landscape painting on the left has excellent composition and charm. Ms. Gu's painting exhibition is currently being held at the Women's Bank Building on Nanjing Road.

### Talking About the New New Capital Hotel

— Guest

When a new film is released, if it is worth criticizing or introducing, then I think a newly opened restaurant is also worth doing the same. Anyway, they both belong to the business of a prosperous urban society. And the capital invested by investors, the latter is even higher than the former; then especially at present, new films have disappeared, but on the contrary, large restaurants are opening one after another, crowded before and after. I, with the qualifications of a film critic, to act as a "food critic", there is no start without the small cleverness of "speculation".

### Discarding the Old Look

The New Capital Hotel, destroyed by fire, will meet with the people of Shanghai again tomorrow. Fire, that terribly powerful fellow, is really terrible. It burned away everything from her, from the ceiling to the floor, nothing was left? Even the "New Capital Hotel" sign, high above Nanjing Guizhou Road, was burned to a crisp.

But, don't worry, there are more powerful guys in the world than fire, and that is young people, young people with a bit of ambition and ambition! You see, he has completed the New Capital Hotel again. It is new, completely new, the New Capital Hotel not only discarded its old look, removed the shackles of the previous era, but also among its peers, it is not an exaggeration to say that she is the leader of the Far East.

The new New Capital Hotel is on the sixth floor of the New New Company, according to the company's naming "New every day, new every month". Indeed, the New New Company has been running on a new road in recent years, and this time it has absorbed a large number of experts from the sea who are handling high-end restaurants to restore the New Capital Hotel.

### The Ideal Restaurant

Take the elevator from Guizhou Road or Guangxi Road and go directly to the sixth floor, which is the New Capital Hotel. This is the side door, or you can take two large elevators from the shopping mall, which is the main entrance. The first thing that makes people feel comfortable and surprised when you run in is the harmonious lighting, which is a collaboration between KY Wang, an engineer who just came from Cornell University in the United States studying optics, and Xiao Zongying. Of course, a considerable amount of money was also spent. It is said that the total cost of the ceiling and lighting is more than 170,000, which is thought to be unique among all the pavilions in Shanghai.

The air-conditioning is also sparing no effort, and it is always the weather of San Francisco, 76 degrees. The New Capital has no summer. The radiators have also been fully installed, and there should be no winter. It is said that these two items cost more than 600,000.

### Studying Restaurant Science

But how can such a huge amount of capital, the New Capital Hotel, which has already used 3 million savings, comply with the laws of commercial profit? But what Mr. Li Xianying, the manager of the hotel, told me was lovely and respectable.

"We are a bit silly, we just want to create a restaurant in our ideal, and don't care about anything else",

Mr. Li Xianying used to be a reporter for a famous small newspaper in this city. He graduated from the Department of Sociology of National Central University and has studied hotel and restaurant science. He is especially good at theory. Last year, he also followed Mr. Ilic, a Westerner who graduated from the Department of Hotel Science of the University of Vienna, to study this subject. He once worked at the New Asia Grand Hotel and successively founded the Ningbo Garden Hotel and the Shanghai Meihua Restaurant. He is creative, hardworking, and looks like a Cantonese, but he is from Ningbo.

### The Three Principles of Truth, Goodness and Beauty

According to Mr. Li, he regards "truth, goodness and beauty" as the creed of service. He said that he wants real dishes and does not want to use MSG alone. He also honestly said that MSG has to be used in low-priced dishes; but in more expensive dishes, such as a table of 400 yuan, he will try to avoid things like MSG.

Serving is the second important thing, and the word "good" is used as the purpose. Serving people kindly is not to respond for "tips". He uses the Lemen principle of American hotel experts, namely: This hotel regards making customers happy as a business less door; Do not let any customer who has not been made happy leave; Do not let any waiter who cannot make customers happy enter the competition.

Equipment is the third thing that should be paid attention to. Attention should be paid to the beauty of the distribution table everywhere, the unity of beauty, and the harmony of beauty. Because the beautiful performance of a restaurant is not pure, it is comprehensive, from the hanging lights in the hall to the heels of the waitresses, there should be some beautiful concepts that can fit together. Moreover, in addition to the external beauty of a small thing, you must pay attention to whether the materials used are noble and how comfortable they are to those who enjoy them. (To be continued)

### If Floating Positions Are Not Liquidated, Public Bonds Will Rise More Vigorously

The public bond grey market continued its upward trend yesterday, marking the third consecutive day of gains. However, the overall pattern was one of initial gains followed by a softening, suggesting a potential pause in the upward momentum. Recently, due to the stagnation in various industries, speculators have once again turned to public bonds. Only if investors join in will there be further strength. Currently, only the Beibang Xinhua firm possesses considerable investment strength. Unfortunately, many are still liquidating floating positions, hindering sustained momentum. Yesterday, Lianhe, Runli, Hengyu, Yichang liquidated some positions, while Xinhua, Tongli, Gongmao, Jiufeng, Hengxing, Dazhong, and Lianyi all made purchases. Apart from one type that declined slightly by two jiao, the other types continued to rise by one to six jiao. The total transaction volume was approximately two million yuan. A summary table is listed below:

| Category | Highest  | Lowest  | Closing  | Change from Previous Day |
| :------- | :------- | :------- | :------- | :----------------------- |
| Tong Jia  | 39.20   | 38.50   | 38.30   | Down 0.20             |
| Tong Yi  | 37.30   | 36.80   | 37.10   | Up 0.60               |
| Tong Bing | 37.00   | 37.00   | 37.20   | Up 0.30               |
| Tong Ding | 34.50   | 34.40   | 34.50   | Up 0.10               |
| Tong Wu  | 26.10   | 35.60   | 35.90   | Up 0.40               |

### Precious Metals Still at Old Prices

Yesterday, the Shanghai Gold Shop Association's selling price for jewelry gold remained at 2,300 yuan per tael (with a reduction of over 300 yuan for purchases). Inter-dealer pricing was relatively stable. In the morning, it was 2,050 yuan per tael, reaching a high of 2,055 yuan, then falling back to around 2,040 yuan, the same as last Saturday's price, with a fluctuation of 15 yuan. Transaction volume was not high. Jewelry silver remained at 16 yuan per tael, and the inter-dealer price was 11 yuan and 78 jiao, a slight increase.

### Military Notes and Discount Rates Stabilize

Yesterday, the foreign exchange market saw Japanese military notes stabilizing. The inter-dealer price remained at 5 yuan, 5 jiao, 5 fen, and 2.3 li. The buying and selling prices offered by silver firms and money shops were 5 yuan, 5 jiao, 4 fen, and 5 yuan, 5 jiao, 6 fen to 6 and a half fen, with little change reported.

Yesterday, the Shanghai Money Trade Association's discount rate was two jiao, and the rediscount of new remittance draft notes was flat, it was said.

### Bran Scouring Countryside With Utmost Effort

The supply of bran remained scarce, with rural agents continuing to scour the countryside with utmost effort. Prices rose again by three to four yuan. For example, 500 small bags of Sanxin bran with July 3rd warehouse receipts were priced at 104 yuan to 104.5 yuan.

### Chinese Stocks Overcome Weakness, New Pharmaceutical Industry Rises Faster

Yesterday, the Chinese stock market overcame its weakness, with a rebound towards stability. The New Pharmaceutical and Sino-French stocks were particularly favored by buyers, surging to 82.5 yuan. Minyi followed suit, with the former rising by 1.5 yuan and the latter by 2.5 yuan. Cultural stocks also saw new buying activity. The Commercial Press remained stable and firm, while Zhonghua and Shijie both rose by 2.5 yuan. There seemed to be potential for further upward progress. Dasheng No. 3 Factory reached a high price of 262.5 yuan and still rose by 10 yuan. In the department store sector, Wing On and Sincere were stable, and Innerwear rose by 0.5 yuan. Shanghai Cotton Spinning declined slightly, while Chinese Electrical returned up half a yuan. Zhabei Water & Electricity was stagnant, and Nanyang Cured Tobacco rose by 2.5 yuan. Dachungwa Match was uniquely weak and struggled to rebound. According to the sentiments of most investors, they have largely shifted towards prosperity, and trading activity has slightly increased. The market prices of various stocks are listed separately below:

### Bean Cake Sales Are Real But Not Smooth

Beans: Trading yesterday was slightly subdued, and the market was generally flat. For example, 30 bags of Tianjin green beans were priced at 226 yuan, and 10 bags of Chongming sea silkworms were priced at 107 yuan.

Sweet Potato Dried: Supply and demand were roughly equivalent, and the market was stable. For example, 60 bags of Jiangbei sweet potato dried were priced at 107.5 yuan, and 40 bags of Shandong sweet potato dried were priced at 125 yuan.

Bean Cake: Sales were real but lacked smoothness, and the market turned loose. Prices saw a general decline of one to two yuan. For example, 300 pieces of Shengji bean cake from June were priced at 58 yuan, 500 pieces of Wanggu warehouse receipts from April were priced at 62 yuan, 500 pieces of Wanggu warehouse receipts from June were priced at 63.5 yuan, and 500 pieces of Yoshida warehouse receipts were priced at 67.1 yuan.

### Coarse and Fine Cloth Transactions Quiet, Eastern Cloth Market Continues to Decline Due to End of Month Factors

Factory Cloth: The cloth market was sluggish again yesterday, but ultimately did not break free from the pattern of hovering and holding. Transactions of various coarse and fine cloths were extremely quiet, and continued to fall by one to two yuan. Sixteen-pound Earth coarse cloth was 178 yuan, Flying Goose 175 yuan, Nine-pound New Character 108 yuan, Eight-pound Zhenzhong 105 yuan, Twelve-pound Earth fine cloth 165 yuan, Dapeng old warehouse receipt trade at 158 yuan, Fuguai fine twill 135 yuan, Magnolia bleached cloth 164 yuan, Qin Meiren raw cloth 130 yuan, Meirenyu raw twill 141 yuan, Jiu Xin Shui Lang flannel 3 yuan and 3 jiao, Changshou palace silk 6 yuan and 1 jiao, all declined. However, the Peach Blossom Lady’s cotton remained stable, closing at 263 yuan at noon and 263 yuan and 2.5 jiao in the afternoon, down only 2.5 jiao from last week.

Eastern Cloth: Due to the end of the month, many small traders were liquidating floating positions, and the market continued to decline. Twelve-pound Longtou fine cloth new orders started at 186 yuan, falling to 182.5 yuan, and rebounding to 183.5 yuan at noon, down four yuan from last week. Four Gentlemen serge opened at 7 yuan and 2 jiao and 6 fen, closing at 7 yuan and 1 jiao and 4 fen, also down 1.4 jiao.

### Xuzhou Vegetables Officially Offering New Crop

The official new crop of Xuzhou vegetables arrived in small quantities yesterday, ten packages, which were promptly transferred. The color and quality were excellent, but the strands were slightly thin, though meaty. They could be called superior quality. However, as the Guangdong ship had already departed, buyers were not willing to pay high prices. The local dealers were planning to test the new crop and were currently negotiating prices.

### Yuan Dates Continue to Rise

Yuan dates continued to rise because the Beijing market was tight, and there were signs of a poor new crop in the production areas. As a result, the local market expanded, and dealers were particularly firm. First-grade goods rose by about 20 yuan, opening at 348 yuan, with higher prices at 355 yuan. Approximately 200 packages were traded, a low amount.

### Cigarettes In Struggling Condition

Cigarette prices rose sharply over the weekend, and yesterday's prices maintained the momentum. The market atmosphere was quite tight. Golden Gun cigarettes saw the strongest rise, and the other selling prices were all in a struggling state. British Brands were 8,500 yuan, Old Knife Brand 5,500 yuan, Pinhai Brand 4,600 yuan, Fairy Brand 3,700 yuan, Wuhua Brand 3,350 yuan, Japanese Golden Gun Brand 1,420 yuan, up 100 yuan from the weekend, Golden Building Brand 1,860 yuan, Red Rose Brand 970 yuan, Quanlu Brand 1,550 yuan, 20-pack Quanlu Brand 1,600 yuan, Guide Brand 1,250 yuan, National Brand Golden Mouse 1,500 yuan, Beautiful Brand 2,550 yuan, and Pyramid Brand 2,900 yuan, temporarily reported calm. The daily necessities market remained stable.

### Broad Leather - Short Supply and Very Popular

The genuine No. 36-inch broad leather available on the market has already declined sharply, so factories have also begun to produce starter materials and black iron blanks, because they are cheap and beautiful, and are happily used by enamel factories, basin factories, mirror factories, thermos factories, and small workshops. Furthermore, because the genuine goods are in short supply and difficult to find, the dealers' mindset is naturally high, and the market atmosphere is exceptionally lively. However, because the genuine goods are in short supply and difficult to find, actual sales are difficult to flourish, while the transaction volume of secondary goods and blank materials has increased, and the standard selling prices are also firm and high. Currently, genuine No. 36-inch goods are selling for 21,000 yuan per ton, 2,000-pound black iron blanks are selling for 16,000 yuan per ton, No. 12 to No. 14 starter materials are selling for 14,000 yuan per ton, and No. 20 black iron sheet starter materials also require around 16,000 yuan per ton. In addition, the prices of various hardware products are also high and sales are scarce, such as new triangular iron at 14,000 yuan per ton, new foreign square plates at 13,000 yuan per ton, new road skin at 15,000 yuan per ton, foreign square plate starters at 11,000 yuan per ton, and triangular iron starters at 11,000 yuan per ton (with slight additions for the above items).

Spring and Autumn

### Life and Labor

— Lin Shansheng

After reading Mr. Yan Yan's "Life and Survival" and Mr. Shunyi's "About Life and Survival," I also had a few small thoughts.

Currently, at least many people are shouting that "life is painful." They exhaust the most labor every day, but only receive meager compensation. This phenomenon is not only true for coolies who sell their sweat and blood, but also for the "salaried class," who are superficially considered to have a leisurely life, also have the same guilt.

However, excessive labor (including physical and mental labor) is not enough to make people feel the pain of life, but too little compensation is enough to discourage people's courage to live. Rickshaw pullers are most happy to pull their rickshaws in the rain. They do not think that labor is painful. On the contrary, they can take the opportunity to ask you for a good price or put on airs and ignore you. They also have a day to be proud of.

"Much labor, little reward" is an unfair phenomenon of rights and obligations, but the truth that "life must be labored" is still undeniable. Many people can "gain without labor" and "enjoy their benefits without working." This so-called life is just a drunken dream and a wretched existence, no different from parasites that depend on decaying wood and grass for survival.

Therefore, the most painful people in the world are not those who "labor but do not gain," but those who "do not have the instinct to labor." I believe that one day it will become a reality. So we can all muster our courage to "continue to labor" and "continue to live."

### Bitter Tea

— Luo Chen

It's so hot!

The asphalt road has become soft and cottony under the intense sunlight. The rickshaw pullers are panting, and sweat hangs from their dark faces, making their faces shine as if they were coated with oil. The ice sellers are running around, shouting loudly in their hoarse voices. The signs of cold drink shops are tempting passersby.

I stopped in front of the icebox of an ice cream shop and turned to call my friend: "I'm terribly thirsty, let's have some ice cream!"

"No," he pulled me out, "I'll take you to a place."

I reluctantly followed him back into the street.

We walked into a small Cantonese snack shop, sat down at a table, and the waiter ran over and asked what we wanted to eat. My friend said, "Two servings of herbal tea!"

"It's bitter!" the waiter warned.

"I know," my friend replied.

This made me feel strange. I looked at my friend with a questioning look. He deliberately turned his head to look at the old price list posted on the wall, as if to say, "Wait a moment and you will understand."

The herbal tea came. I picked up the bowl and greedily took a big sip. The iced tea did make me feel comfortable, but I didn't expect such an unbearable bitterness!

My friend smiled at my frowning face. I glared at him angrily. I said, "Why did you bring me here to eat this disgusting thing?"

My friend smiled calmly, silently drinking the bitter tea from the bowl. "Drink it, wait a moment and you will feel that it is much better than ice cream."

I reluctantly finished the remaining half of the bowl of bitter tea and walked out of the small shop with my friend. Walking on the street, my friend spoke:

"How was it?"

I didn't answer, just gave him a hateful look, but he wasn't smiling at this moment – he said very seriously:

"Many people love to eat ice cream. Indeed, ice cream is so sweet and comfortable when it is delivered to the mouth. It really seems to quench your thirst, but when you have finished eating the ice cream, have you experienced the aftertaste? You must have experienced it – it is a nauseatingly sweet feeling that makes you feel even more thirsty, thirsty, thirsty! Herbal tea is certainly bitter when you eat it, but if you carefully taste the bitterness, you will discover a little sweet aftertaste—this is a sweetness, a sweetness that makes people sober, so you are not thirsty at all now, are you?"

I stubbornly, still didn't pay attention to him – in fact, I completely admitted that he was right – I wasn't thirsty at all, unlike when I had eaten ice cream and still wanted to eat ice cream.

"This is like eating sandalwood olives," my friend continued, "...in fact, everything is the same, let's talk about life...in short, you have to chew it carefully..."

"You mean, life..." I interrupted him slowly: "Bitterness—ends—sweetness—comes?"

My friend nodded—we smiled knowingly.

### Time

— Jie Ren

Everyone in the world has long enjoyed the basic wealth equally distributed by nature – "time."

Twenty-four hours of "time" is the same day for princes and commoners, no more and no less. The use of "time" is the basis for building any wealth.

"The use of time is a shortcut to success and also a factor that determines a person's career. If there is a secret here, this is the secret to success.

We should use "time" at any time to study a specialized knowledge and technology, which is the only way for modern young people to move forward.

Today may be a good opportunity for you. Waiting until tomorrow may be too late! Every day is closely related to the career of each person's life, so never ignore it, never delay it. Don't wait until tomorrow – successful people never have a tomorrow.

Words from People

### A Façade Under Elegance

— Feng Ma Niu

Let me tell you, my friend Lao Lian is the "young master" of a decoration shop owner. Although he may not necessarily inherit his father's business in the future, he is "close to vermilion and becomes red." He knows a lot about the market prices and trends of antiques and calligraphy and paintings. I will just pick up some crumbs of knowledge to show that "every profession produces an expert" and that every item has its tricks. I think readers will also enjoy hearing about it.

It turns out that recently the "market price" of antiques and calligraphy and paintings has been quite "hot." As long as you go to see the marked prices at each calligraphy and painting exhibition, you are sure to be stunned. A page of fan surface is worth hundreds, and a framed painting is worth thousands, and these are all the minimum quality goods. However, there are still people buying them. It seems that everyone thinks that buying this kind of calligraphy and painting in these days of difficulty in eating is stupid, but the buyers don't think so. Among the buyers, most are "nouveau riche" who have no interest in studying calligraphy and painting, no qualifications for appreciation, but just buy them to decorate their own facade, raise their own status, and spend a few dollars to be elegant. They regard it as equal to opening a small house, eating flower wine, and raising cats and crows. Others have a lot of cash in hand, and are temporarily encouraged by their friends to buy calligraphy and paintings. Most of them regard these antique things as solid soap and white wax candles, hoping to buy them cheaply and find a "household" to sell them at a high price. The difference between elegance and vulgarity is not special, so why not do it? However, some have more accurate vision than the previous "elegant scholars," and after mixing with brokers and antique dealers for a long time, they have gradually become "veterans."

These buyers have never heard their "appreciation criticism" or "impression criticism," where the brushwork is good, where the painting brush is wonderful, everyone has forgotten, just arguing about its authenticity; the genuine one is good, can buy big money, even if it is a celebrity's careless scribbles, also treat it like a precious jewel. In the calligraphy and painting industry, idol worship is prevalent, not to mention that sellers and buyers are arguing about money! Even if they don't care, then they are the kind of "idiots," and "idiots" don't understand what is genuine or fake at all, just let people cheer them on and echo them.

In fact, is there no day when these antique calligraphy and paintings are sold out? Moreover, after several rounds of artillery fire, the authors died or scattered. Even if there are still some in production today, there is a trend of supply not meeting demand. Then how do some antique brokers deal with these customers who are willing to spend big money? This requires talking about "every profession produces an expert." Among those who make a living from antiques, calligraphy and paintings, there are some nameless epigraphers, calligraphers and painters who, with their exquisite skills, can imitate the works of various schools, ancient and modern celebrities, can write Mi Cai, can paint the Four Wangs, can carve statues, and can seal seals, but they do not have the ingenuity of creation, and are always trapped in the dishonorable act of making fake things. They also understand all kinds of "chemical tricks," how to wipe away stains, how to modify them, and how to fumigate them with coal ash to make them "antique." When they find a genuine product, they rush to copy dozens of them overnight, sweating in the summer and exhaling in the winter. Their only goal is to deceive the eyes of buyers and fill them with counterfeit goods. It is also pitiful to say that they have also encountered bad luck now. The soaring prices of all kinds of paper and the high cost of mounting are not light if they cannot be sold, and the labor and time have not been calculated. Therefore, some fake antique calligraphy and paintings (of course, they were bought as genuine products in the first place), which could only be bought as waste paper a few years ago, can now be worth dozens or hundreds when bought in antique shops. They only need to undergo a "surgery" to mark a high price at the exhibition. If it is sold, the cost is low, and it saves the effort of thankless manufacturing. Why not do it?

In short, calligraphy and paintings and antiques seem to be elegant things, but it is up to people to do it. Judging from the current relationship between sellers and buyers, isn't there just a façade of elegance?

### Revision of Begonia

— Qin Shouou

Writing a full-length novel may be a very easy thing for many other writers, but for someone as stupid and lazy as me, it is really more difficult than raising a physically weak child. The fact that the final draft was able to be completed is truly "Heaven's blessing." In addition to the readers' perceptible enthusiasm, I really cannot but attribute the credit to the encouragement of the Shen Bao brother, otherwise "Begonia" would have died early.

And this time, the publication of the standalone volume of "Begonia" should especially thank this newspaper and the high regard of the gentlemen of the Jincheng Book Company.

After "Begonia" was completely published in this newspaper, several gentlemen in the publishing industry contacted me, wanting to print it into a standalone volume, but at that time, I felt very uneasy about the last section of the book. The readers also felt that Begonia's death seemed too hasty. In fact, it was not that he wanted to die so hastily, but because I was busy preparing the Political Compilation, I made him die abruptly. Later, I looked at it myself, and I deeply felt the need to revise it. It just so happened that the Political Compilation had been suspended since July 1, so I concentrated my energy and spent a full six days re-proofing it and rewriting the entire last section, deriving it into one section, so that the last climax developed in a more reasonable environment. In this way, not only was Begonia's death more natural and more painful than the first draft, but also the other protagonist in the book, Liu Yuhua—Begonia's senior brother—was also accounted for, and a loophole in the first draft was filled.

As for how the ending is after the revision, then I have to keep it a secret and ask the readers to go and see the standalone volume themselves!

### Old and Young

— Zhang Yueshan

The behavior of young people is erroneous, the behavior of middle-aged people is competitive, and the behavior of old people is repentant. - Disraeli

Young people must have the knowledge of old age, and old people must have the spirit of youth. - Zhang Chao

Old people all know what youth and stupidity are; but not one young person knows what old age and wisdom are. - Chamberlain

Old age is like the night of a person's life, just as night is like the old age of daylight, but night is still full of solemnity and greatness. Many people think that night is more brilliant than daylight. - Svechin

### Sharing the Same Boat in the Storm

— He Jia Zhi

(7) Thunder

Cui Zhen was also unheard of, and took the same attitude as Weicheng, listening attentively. Mrs. Ye Er touched her hair and thought for a while, and said, "We two sisters-in-law are people who sympathize with each other, and we must be closer than other people's sisters and sisters-in-law, so your mother told me what she had never told anyone. One year, Dajing Town held a large-scale welcoming ceremony for the gods. The team lined up in a long snake array, as long as ten miles. No matter the people of the farmer, industry, commerce, all came to the meeting. Three or four months before the meeting, every family in the places where the team passed invited relatives and friends, saying that on a certain day of a certain month, you must come to see the meeting, if you don't come, you will have to wait ten or twenty years. At that time, your mother was still a girl. When she heard about this grand meeting, she followed your uncle, as well as her sisters and brothers from the same village, probably a dozen people, and took a big boat. They could cook on the boat, and they could sleep on the boat at night. They set sail the night before, planning to rock the boat to Dajing Town, and still arrive before dawn. Weicheng, you must know that there are hundreds of thousands of people who go to see the Dajing Town meeting; those who come from afar, like Songjiang, Suzhou, Wuxi, and especially Shanghai people, most of them come by boat. It is said that the day before, the several major rivers in the east, west, north, and south of Dajing Town had been cut off by ships from all over the world. The boat that your mother and your uncle were on had not yet reached Dajing Town, and it was squeezed forward by the boats in front. When asked how far it was to Dajing Town, some said: it's one mile. Some said; as long as you can see the meeting, this is also Dajing Town, you must rush to the front. Some said: if you take this river, you can't rock to the town, turn around and change to another river, you can still rock to the town. But the boats behind your mother and your uncle came in droves in the blink of an eye, and it became impossible to move forward or retreat." (139)
