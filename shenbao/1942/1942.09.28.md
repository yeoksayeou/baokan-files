### Soviet Troops Launch Major Counter-Offensive North and South of Stalingrad; German Troops Advance Eastward in the Caucasus; Major Battle Occurs on the Banks of the Terek River

Near the Soviet Border, 27th (Havas News Agency)

A major battle is currently taking place near the Terek River. The main objective of the German forces is to occupy the two major towns of Grozny and Ordzhonikidze. A large number of German and Soviet troops are participating in this battle. The German-Romanian forces are launching fierce attacks to the east and south of the Terek River, but are encountering fierce resistance from the Red Army. The German-Romanian forces are also advancing along the highway from Lenkik to Duayatamus and along the Black Sea coast southeast of Meigup. There have been no major changes in the battle situation in the Stalingrad area. The fighting inside and outside the city continues to be fierce and is intensifying. The Red Army has launched large-scale offensives south and north of the city under the cover of the air force in an attempt to disrupt the German forces.

Moscow, 26th (Havas News Agency)

The Red Army High Command issued a war report stating that our troops engaged in fierce battles with enemy forces in Stalingrad, Mozdok, and Sinyavino last night. Northwest of Stalingrad, our troops have improved their positions. There have been no major changes on other fronts.

Berlin, 27th (Haitong News Agency)

According to military sources here, the German forces in the Caucasus continue to advance. It has not been announced whether the German forces will advance towards the port of Tuapse on the Black Sea coast. Two cities in the Terek River basin have been occupied by German forces after fierce battles, but the names of the cities have not been announced. The German forces south of Stalingrad have made considerable progress. The fighting in the north is near three major industrial plants.

Berlin, 27th (Haitong News Agency)

On Friday night, the German Air Force heavily bombed the city of Astrakhan in the Volga River basin. German bombs rained down on the city's oil depots and railway facilities. The junction station and oil depots in the Volga Delta were also bombed, causing fires in many places.

Stockholm, 27th (Havas News Agency)

The battle for Stalingrad has reached its sixth week. What can be said is that the southern part of the city and three railway stations are already in the hands of the German forces, but there is still resistance from the Red Army in the area. Therefore, the German forces are currently engaged in mop-up operations. The fighting in the central area of the city is chaotic, and the positions of the German and Soviet forces are almost on a single line. However, the German side announced yesterday that it had occupied six administrative buildings in the Volga River area. As for the north of the city, the Red Army is holding three major factories, which is enough to control the entire city's defenses, which are solid and impregnable. According to sources in Berlin, it will take some time and great effort for the German forces to occupy this resistance center. In the Caucasus, the German advance is slow due to natural obstacles and fierce resistance from the Red Army. In the Voronezh region, the German forces have launched several large-scale offensives. In the Rzhev region, after a fierce battle, the Red Army has broken through the German defenses, but Berlin still claims that the war is still ongoing.

### Commemorating the Tripartite Pact; Tojo Delivers a Speech and Sends Congratulatory Telegrams to German and Italian Leaders; Mass Rally Held in Tokyo Yesterday

Commemorative ceremonies are being held on a grand scale throughout Japan. In Tokyo, a celebratory luncheon was held at the Foreign Minister's residence at 12:30 PM, attended by Prime Minister Tojo and all cabinet ministers, the ambassadors from the Axis powers of Germany and Italy, and others.

The Yokusankai representative then read the resolution of the Central Cooperation Council, and the rally concluded with three cheers for the Emperor, followed by cheers for Führer Hitler and Prime Minister Mussolini.

Tokyo, 27th (Central News Agency)

Prime Minister Tojo of Japan attended the commemorative rally for the second anniversary of the signing of the Tripartite Pact between Japan, Germany, and Italy on the afternoon of the 27th and delivered a speech stating that, looking back over the past two years, the close relationship between Japan, Germany, and Italy has progressed day by day and has increasingly demonstrated its cooperation. Especially since the Empire's entry into the war, the East and West have launched magnificent operations and achieved great war results that have never been seen in world history. The light of the future is drawing closer and has advanced to the stage of achieving common goals. This is truly cause for celebration for the three signatory countries and related nations. Furthermore, the Empire has always valued faith and righteousness, and the strong unity within the country and the alliance between the three countries are all based on this faith and righteousness. This kind of faith and righteousness of the Empire has not changed in three thousand years and will never be shaken by changes in the world. Any conspiracies or instigations by the enemy countries are impossible. Now, the Empire is further upholding this path of faith and righteousness, both internally to realize the unity of the entire nation and externally to strengthen the alliance between the three countries, in order to achieve the final victory in this unprecedented great war. On the occasion of the second anniversary of the signing of the Tripartite Pact between Japan, Germany, and Italy, I reaffirm our determination to strive forward with the strong alliance between the three countries to achieve our common goals.

Tokyo, 27th (Central News Agency)

Prime Minister Tojo of Japan sent congratulatory telegrams to President Hitler and Prime Minister Mussolini this morning on the occasion of the second anniversary of the Tripartite Pact between Japan, Germany, and Italy, stating, "On the occasion of the second anniversary of the signing of the Tripartite Pact between Japan, Germany, and Italy, I respectfully express my heartfelt congratulations to Your Excellency the President (Prime Minister) and the people of Germany (Italy). Under the orderly leadership of Your Excellency the President (Prime Minister), the people of Germany (Italy) have overcome all difficulties and achieved glorious war results, and are steadily advancing towards the construction of a new European order. I am deeply impressed. On this commemorative day, I respectfully hope that Japan, Germany, and Italy will further promote the spirit of the treaty, work together to strive for the final victory in this unprecedented great war, and build a new world based on morality."

### Japanese Foreign Minister's Speech

Tokyo, 27th (Central News Agency)

Japanese Foreign Minister Tani delivered the following speech at the celebratory luncheon for the Axis alliance: "In the two years since the conclusion of our Tripartite Pact, the world situation has undergone significant changes. Today, on the occasion of the second anniversary of the signing of the Pact, at a time of global tension, on December 8th of last year, the Japanese Empire issued a great decree declaring war on the United States and Great Britain. Thus, Japan finally rose up to eliminate the British and American forces that had been obstructing peace and tranquility in East Asia for many years. The allied nations of Germany and Italy immediately extended a helping hand to Japan with a spirit of righteousness and declared war on the United States, and concluded an agreement to complete the joint operations of the three countries. Since then, the allied nations of Japan, Germany, and Italy have been active side by side on the battlefield. At that time, the friendly nations in Europe who joined the alliance also took the same actions as Germany and Italy, demonstrating their courage in fighting and killing the enemy. This is something that we must never forget. In just a few months after the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the bases of the United States and Great Britain in the Greater East Asia region were swept away by the Japanese army. The Japanese army continued to carry out operations on land, sea, and air with renewed vigor, achieving great war results and expanding the occupied areas. At the same time, the allied forces of Germany and Italy also achieved great war results in Europe, North Africa, and the Atlantic. The belief in the inevitable victory of the three countries, corresponding to each other in the East and West, has been demonstrated in fact. However, the ultimate goal of Japan, Germany, and Italy is not only to win the war, but also to build a new order. Therefore, our three countries should absolutely adhere to the unwavering trust and close cooperation with each other and move towards the goal of winning the war and building a new world order. At present, we are filled with joy as we look back on the glorious war results achieved by Japan, Germany, Italy, and their allies. In order to realize the ultimate goal of the alliance, we earnestly hope that the three allied countries will have a renewed determination."

### Speeches by German and Italian Ambassadors

Tokyo, 27th (Central News Agency)

The German Ambassador to Japan said at the luncheon that what the German leader and people want to say is only to affirm our belief in victory and peace. This affirmation is based on my knowledge of the national strength of Germany, Italy, and the Allied countries in Europe, and the experience of the ability and spirit of the Allied country Japan. The German army's operations, with the assistance of the Austro-Hungarian army, have penetrated deep into the economic heart of the Soviet Union. In North Africa, they have also established great war results. The arteries of British control of the world are now under our control. The amount of ships lost by the enemy at sea in the world has exceeded the amount of ships they have built several times. The encirclement of the United States and Great Britain in Europe and their suffering over the second front have shown that they are no longer able to wage war. Because of the containment by the Axis forces, their attempts in Dieppe and Tobruk have also been shattered. No matter how much they use air raids, German tanks and aircraft are still being produced continuously, and new submarines are constantly being built and launched. The national strength of Germany and its European allies, whether on the front lines or in the rear, is unwavering and extremely strong. I live in Japan, so I know in particular that the Japanese army has eradicated the enemy's bases in the Pacific in a few months, and has secured a vast occupied area. Without the slightest relaxation, it is still actively preparing for an attack. Japan is not only carrying out the current operations in the Greater East Asia region, but we know that it is advancing and establishing plans and policies for a future of peace. Regarding Japan's national strength, what impresses foreigners most is the calm and integrity that the Japanese people have shown during this great war. This kind of strong spirit is truly admirable. Because we deeply understand the national strength of Japan and our European countries, we can affirm our belief in inevitable victory on the occasion of today's commemoration of the signing of the Tripartite Pact.

Tokyo, 27th (Central News Agency)

The Italian Ambassador to Japan, Indelli, said that our Axis friendship is increasing day by day, and we are determined to strive for the final victory, and we will certainly defeat the Allied Nations completely. Only then can the fundamental purpose of the Tripartite Pact be realized. At that time, our Axis powers will be able to concentrate their efforts according to their respective needs and historical positions, and establish a system of free survival within the Co-Prosperity Sphere.

### Key Points of Speeches by German and Italian Foreign Ministers

Berlin, 27th (Haitong News Agency)

German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop delivered a radio speech last night stating that Germany, Italy, and Japan signed the Tripartite Pact in Berlin on September 27, 1940. On the eve of the second anniversary, on behalf of the German people and government, he expressed his congratulations to the people and governments of Italy, Japan, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, Slovakia, and Croatia who participated in the pact. The goal of the Tripartite Pact was to prevent the spread of the European war, but the European war has expanded into a world war. The Tripartite Pact can also facilitate the restoration of peace and open up the way for a comprehensive reorganization of the world. The enemies of the Tripartite Pact countries are greedy and selfish, and they reject the natural rights of countries to stable development, the right to space, and the right to enjoy world resources. This attitude has caused important rights issues for the Tripartite Pact countries, even the right to survival. During this period, the Tripartite Pact has closely united the signatory countries to fight against the enemy. In the inevitable struggle for survival, the Tripartite Pact has achieved great victories on land, sea, and air, and has established an unshakeable and solid position. The enemy continues to deny the position already obtained by the Tripartite Pact countries. The Tripartite Pact countries still have to make arduous efforts. The Tripartite Pact countries have the legitimate reason and steel-like determination to defeat the enemy anytime and anywhere until the enemy no longer interferes with the living space of the Tripartite Pact countries, and then the prerequisite for building a new order is already in place. The Tripartite Pact is the foundation of the strongest group of countries. After the end of the war for freedom and victory, it will continue to be the pillar of the new world order and the guarantee of a happy and peaceful era.

Rome, 26th (Havas News Agency)

Italian Foreign Minister Ciano delivered a radio speech tonight stating that two years have passed since Germany, Italy, and Japan signed the Tripartite Pact. Today, we hold a commemorative ceremony, and we have an unshakable belief in winning victory and the ideals of our people engaged in struggle. For several years, Germany, Italy, and Japan have shown their strength to change world history. Therefore, in this struggle, the three countries are united and working together to achieve their goals, so as to restore prosperity and ensure the security of our nations. This is the main purpose of the Tripartite Pact. In short, our purpose is twofold: 1) to realize the aspirations of the nations and build a new world order based on justice; 2) to establish a peace that is in line with justice. In the future, the victory of the European Allied forces will be able to create a peace that is in line with justice for mankind.

### Willkie's Visit to the Soviet Union Results in a Call for a Second Front; Willkie Leaves Moscow for Chongqing

Angara, 27th (Haitong News Agency)

According to sources here, Roosevelt's special envoy, Willkie, left Mocow this morning and set off for Chongqing.

Moscow, 26th (Havas News Agency)

Roosevelt's special envoy, Willkie, left the Soviet Union today. The Truth Newspaper recently published Willkie's itinerary in the Soviet Union, stating that Willkie stayed here for several days and constantly conducted important talks with Soviet cultural and economic leaders. He then went to the front line in Erzurum to visit and met with Lieutenant General Levchenko, the commander of the war zone, for a long time. Afterwards, he went to Kuibyshev again to meet with government authorities.

Moscow, 26th (Havas News Agency)

Roosevelt's special envoy, Willkie, made a statement to the press here today, saying that the result of my visit to Moscow has made me deeply believe that the United States and Great Britain should open a second front in time. If it is postponed to next summer, it will be too late. Our military leaders must find a way to take action as soon as possible. Apart from this, we must continue to bomb Germany. Our ally, the Soviet Union, requires 1,000 aircraft every night to take off from Britain to bomb German cities. Since the outbreak of the German-Soviet war, the Red Army has suffered 5 million casualties and prisoners of war, and another 50 million people have been enslaved in the German-occupied areas. It is expected that it will be extremely difficult for the Soviet people to obtain the food they need this winter. Every winter in the Soviet Union, the weather is freezing and the cold is piercing. There is no fire in the room and the clothes are very thin. What is currently stored has been designated to be supplied to the soldiers on the front line and the workers in the important ordnance industry. As for medical supplies, they are also extremely scarce. Although the objective environment is like this, there is no one in the country who advocates abandoning the war. Everyone believes that they can only choose between death and victory, and they all deeply believe that the current war is a struggle for the entire nation, so everyone can endure terrible pain. The men are fighting on the front line, and the women and children are working in factories in the rear to supply the soldiers on the front line with weapons and ammunition. Even children around the age of ten are serving in factories. Now, such brave people will face a terrible winter. Why are Great Britain and the United States still not prepared to launch a war in Europe? Why not directly give Germany a big blow? I can hardly explain to them the serious dangers that our military experts often mention that do not seem to have made a deep impression. We must do our best to help the Soviet Union in any way we can. All the aircraft and tanks that our factories can manufacture must be supplied to the Soviet Union. Other military supplies should be continuously transported to them. It is expected that we should also supply the Soviet Union with food this winter. If we cannot do this, millions of people will die of starvation. No matter how brave a person is, it is difficult to continue fighting when they are hungry and cold. In order to alleviate the suffering of the wounded, we must also transport medical supplies to the Soviet Union. In addition, we must also help the Soviet Union carry out large-scale bombing of major German cities. It must be known that even if we can fully assist this ally, we still feel deeply grateful to the Soviet Union. At this moment, the Soviet Union is doing its best for us, and we will never be able to repay them. In a nutshell, the Soviet people are now facing us and asking us for help and hoping that we will never disappoint them.

### Potential Changes in French Government Organization

Vichy, 26th - Havas World Telegraph Agency

The government will issue a decree within the next week to make slight changes to the government organization, namely, reducing the number of state commissioners attached to the Office of the Head of Government from three to two. That is, Mr. Méchin, assistant to the Office of the Head of Government, will no longer be a state commissioner. However, Mr. Trianon, stationed in Paris, and Rear Admiral Béraud, assistant to the Office of the Head of Government, will remain in their current positions. When Head of Government Laval received reporters two days ago, a reporter asked him to explain in detail. Head of Government Laval immediately replied that he did not want to make any statement at this time, but it must be pointed out that there is absolute unity within the French government.

Vichy, 26th - Havas Agency

Head of Government Laval told reporters that since the signing of the armistice agreement, more than 600,000 French prisoners of war have been released and returned home. Recently, after his negotiations with the German side in Paris, both sides have agreed on a solution. The German side promised that if the French can recruit 150,000 workers to work in Germany, the German side will release 50,000 French prisoners of war to return home. Currently, there are 20,000 workers in the country who have voluntarily gone to Germany as a condition for the release of their compatriots. Recruitment is still continuing, but it is left to the free choice of the people and is not forced. A reporter then asked about the problem of French Jews. According to reports, the current restrictions implemented in the occupied area are limited to foreign Jews, that is, Jews who have lost their nationality. As for French Jews, they are only slightly restricted, for example, French Jews serving in important national agencies are the most important.

### As the Period of Light Control Approaches, All Parties Actively Prepare, Alley Lights to be Reduced to a Very Few, White Paint to be Used for Roadside Warnings

With only three days left until the ten-day period of light control, the police departments and air defense committees of the two concessions are stepping up their efforts to complete all preparations on schedule. It seems that the light control devices for each household, such as black lampshades and window curtains, have been fully prepared by the Baojia personnel. The matters that should be paid attention to now are the reduction of lights and the preparation of light for various vehicles. During the period of light control, the police officers directing traffic will wear white armbands and white oversleeves for easy identification. The number of street lights in the Public Concession will be reduced from 5,700 to 570. The French Concession will also reduce the number of red and green traffic lights as appropriate. The lighting surface will be completely painted except for a cross shape left in the middle. All traffic lines and wire mesh on the roads directing traffic have also been painted with white powder.

Removal of Alley Lights

Starting today (the 28th), the authorities will dispatch employees to continue removing street lights in various alleys. Most of the residential areas in Shanghai are in the form of alleys, and the number of street lights in the alleys ranges from a dozen to one or two. It is understood that the authorities believe that the lights in the alleys are less necessary than those on the roads, so they have decided to remove all of them. At most, they will leave one or two lights that are absolutely necessary.

Lianbao Notice

According to the Datong News Agency reporter, since yesterday, the Lianbao in various districts of the two concessions have formally issued emergency notices and printed a large number of leaflets.

It is hoped that residents will pay special attention when walking on the road or carrying items at night.

Since it began in early May, it has cured thousands of people. As of the end of September, the estimated cost will be more than 100,000 yuan.

### Second Football Trial Match, Donghua Sheng Team Draw Again, Donghua Wins Stably But Not Successfully, Result Four to Four

The Donghua fought Sheng Fangji again in the football trial match at 5:00 PM yesterday at the Jingansi Road Racecourse. The number of people who went to watch it was still not small. As a result, Donghua was strong first and then helped to win steadily but not successfully, resulting in Sheng Fangji's opportunity to make peace. The score was four to four. Sheng Fangji had sufficient stamina and was formidable. In the first half, Donghua led by four to two. In the second half, Donghua Liang Shutang was transferred to the rear defense to replace Pan Minghai's vacancy. Yuan Kun Tian supplemented the offensive, which was greatly reduced. Although Dai Jia was brave and valiant, he was helpless due to the lack of assistance. Zhang Banglun's performance was the most colorful and he saved many dangerous balls. Liang Shutang's forward attack was sharp and he scored two of the four goals. He was transferred to the defense in the second half and Sheng Fangji's offensive was greatly increased. Donghua's deployment was a mistake, and Lao Liang's contribution cannot be ignored. Jia Dai still maintained his original state and his contribution was the greatest. Long Haizhao Peng Youren Ming Sheng are also good. Kun Tian was unable to do what he wanted, and Cao Qinfang was difficult to climb to the hall of elegance. Shu Qigeng fell inexplicably in the first half and tried his best to block it later to offset his crime. Pan Minghai was brave but reckless. Sheng team Fu En was the best and his contact with Jem Huaite was very effective and he made a lot of bloody contributions. Hanni Bo was second. The goalkeeper Yi Weinuofu lacked courage and was too nervous in the battle. Greenburg's skills can be called superb, but the referee Shen Huichun was irritable.

### Trip to Hangzhou (Middle)

— Qian Zhai Ren

A large bowl of stir-fried shrimp with oil, a large plate of clear shrimp meat, a pot of stir-fried kidneys, a large pot of new corn fried chicken, whole duck in vinegar sauce, whole fish, winter melon soup with southern meat, stewed clams, large crucian carp, and braised trotters. These dishes can't be finished even by six or seven people, and they only cost 120 yuan in savings notes. Do you think it's cheap or not? Wouldn't it cost four or five hundred yuan to eat in a restaurant in Shanghai?

Vegetables are naturally better and cheaper in Hangzhou. The edamame pods are fat and large, and the taro is even better. The water chestnuts are even cheaper. At this time, fresh chestnuts are on the market in Hangzhou, which are best used to stir-fry tender chicken. Fruits, except for water chestnuts, persimmons are sold everywhere, the largest costing two corners each, which would cost five corners in savings notes in Shanghai.

The food is certainly cheaper in Hangzhou, but the sugar ration is insufficient. Recently, each person is limited to buying one yuan of sugar. Cigarettes are much more expensive than in Shanghai, and there are many fakes.

Eating also has a somewhat connected relationship, which is flies. There are particularly many flies in Hangzhou, especially the red-headed firefly flies. As long as food is put out, the flies will always try it first, especially the red-headed flies, which are both clumsy and stubborn and have no sense of smell. As soon as they are driven away, they go to the vegetable soup. It is a pity to see groups of flies dancing in front of the dishes, and it is very difficult. There are several restaurants in Hangzhou that specialize in mutton. People who like to eat mutton for breakfast rush there, so business is booming. Sheep brains, sheep kidneys, and sheep livers are all sold cheaply for five or six corners a pot. The mutton buns are especially famous, but when I stepped into the restaurant and saw the table where the buns were made full of first-class big flies, I dared not accept the mutton buns, no matter how good they were.

I have already written a lot about eating in Hangzhou, enough to whet the readers' appetites, so I will stop here.

— Clothing and Other Business Conditions

Clothing materials are not cheap in Hangzhou. The cheapest rough cloth costs two yuan and one corner per foot. This is the market price, and retail stores charge even more. The Four Gentlemen Shilins cost three yuan a foot, the Wulu Modern Blue costs two yuan and three blocks per foot, the Parelli crepe costs two yuan and eight yuan, and the satin costs two yuan and nine, all calculated per foot. Citizens all shake their heads and say that the clothing materials are too expensive.

Recently, many paper stores have opened in Hangzhou, almost every street has a paper store, so even large silver buildings have been converted into paper stores. Most of the paper is transported from Yu Kang, and the price is calculated per piece. For example, the market price for curtains is 330 yuan per piece. Most of the commodities are under control. I heard that paper goods will also be included in the system recently.

Hangzhou tea is famous, but you can't drink good tea. Recently, the market price for Longjing tea is eight yuan per catty and black tea is three yuan and six corners.

Hangzhou does not count people for food rations. As long as you have money, you can buy rice and grain. The market price for white rice is 275 yuan per stone and glutinous rice is 310 yuan. Many common people eat coarse grains, especially corn flour, which is the most popular.

The market prices for the main daily necessities are roughly as described above. As for jewelry and jewelry, Hangzhou has a jewelry alley that specializes in selling jewelry. Now if you go and see, it is really a desolate scene.

Economic Special Issue No. 433

Weekly Market Commentary

### Exchange Reopening and Price Structuring

The rumor of the reopening of the exchange has been circulating a lot recently. Judging from recent experience, rumors are often close to the truth, so this rumor is of course worthy of attention.

The exchange is a special institution for stabilizing prices. Relying on open and centralized buying and selling, it enables all prices to adjust to each other according to the laws of supply and demand, and eliminates the evils of monopoly and manipulation. This is an institution that best represents the free economic system.

After the outbreak of the August 13th Incident, various exchanges in the city were ordered to close down. The reason why the authorities ordered it to close down was because it was a free economic organization that was not suitable for the economic structure compiled during the war. Therefore, after the exchange market was blocked, it should have been replaced by a compiled economic market. Because the system of compiled economics was not completed, the illegal black market instead arose, and finally it became the unbearable market situation of the past four or five years. Therefore, some people think that it is better to restore the exchange market in order to manage it than to allow the black market to operate. This is not always true.

At present, the Shanghai authorities obviously hold a fixed and unchangeable policy for the transformation of the city's economic system, that is, strict compilation. Therefore, the revival of the exchange market, which is opposite in nature, is actually an unthinkable thing. Some people think that in the compiled economic institutions in North China, the Qingdao Exchange has also been established recently, and the revival of the general exchange in Shanghai is not surprising. Moreover, the exchange can also be managed, and the principle of compiled economics is not completely conflicting. Although this is the case, it is still difficult to imagine in fact, because the price system in compiled economics is generated and determined by artificial compilation, and the price system in the exchange institution is generated and determined by the natural force of the law of supply and demand. It is always unthinkable that the two can coexist, and there will be a loss.

### Market Trends

Public Bonds Without Limit

After the bond market broke the "two-for-one" concept, who knows its future is limitless? Although funds were tight before the holiday, they could not compete with the circulation of public bonds, which were even tighter. Therefore, as soon as the trend loosened, it tightened again. After the holiday, new prices were repeatedly opened. Class C bonds took the lead, surpassing all other bonds. Class B bonds were also not weak, while Class A bonds seemed the least attractive. This reverse trend is based on the saying of discerning the situation. Class A bonds have the shortest repayment period, and Nanjing took more considerations when inheriting them. The longer the repayment period, the more lightly it can be inherited. This is the origin of the reverse trend.

Previously, it was learned that the Fund Custody Committee is now a local organization responsible for compensation. As for the market organization, it is still waiting for the establishment of the new association. Currently, all transactions are done off-market, with those who are fond of starting prices doing so for speculative purposes. Speculation is on the list of things to be banned, so it is said that it cannot be avoided. However, unless it is fundamentally considered hostile and confiscated, otherwise the situation is complicated and it is better to let it be. Since Nanjing has recognized compensation in advance, hostility no longer exists. This is the origin of people's firm confidence.

Chinese Stocks Surge

With the reopening after the Autumn Festival, Chinese stocks suddenly surged, with each stock rising at an astonishing speed. Financial stocks and salt industry stocks advanced by ten yuan, with the China One slightly retreating. Department store stocks each rose by five to ten yuan, except for the Sincere Underwear, which remained unchanged. Textile stocks were the most outstanding, with Wing On Textile leading the way, followed by Qingfeng. Mei Ya and Cui Zhong declined slightly. None of the new pharmaceutical stocks were bad, with smaller ones rising by two or three yuan and larger ones rising by twenty or thirty yuan. Cultural stocks remained strong, and tobacco stocks rose even more sharply. The rest of the stocks were also good, rising by one or two yuan to twenty or thirty yuan. New chips continued to enter the market, and small-value stocks were the most popular. People's confidence is firm, and the trend is still unfolding.

The stock market trend was previously affected by the advance and retreat of prices, and now it is key to the tightness of funds. New operating companies pay close attention to this. Therefore, the currency chips and stock chips are mutually squeezed, and the stock market is increasingly driven higher and higher, which can no longer be explained by common sense.

Yarn, Cloth, and Wool

The trend of yarn, cloth, and wool continued to be strong, reaching its peak before the holiday and then falling back after the holiday. This abnormal phenomenon is unbelievable.

Before the holiday, Phoenix reached a new high price of 5,120, and Horse jumped to a new peak of 5,750. Comparing the average spot prices from May 26th to 28th this year, the increase in Horse was the most significant.

Phoenix and Horse

May 26th 5000 4700

May 27th 5150 4925

May 28th 5250 4800

Average 5125 4909

The previous record was unreasonable. In terms of cost, Chinese goods were always more expensive than Japanese goods. The above reversal of the situation was actually formed by the control situation at the time, and it gradually corrected itself by opening up trading at the Cotton Exchange. However, the increase before the holiday was excessive, and the subsequent decline was expected. As for piece goods and wool, they are also following suit. Various related associations are currently engaged in cost research in order to determine appropriate prices. According to a report in yesterday's Eastern Daily, the Huazhong Weaving Industry Association has prepared cost calculation books for more than 30 kinds of commodities such as silk and rayon fabrics and has applied to the relevant authorities for negotiated prices.

### Off-Market Chit-Chat

Lifting the curfew is beneficial to the night market. The recovery of the night market is beneficial to the prosperity of the market. However, in today's era of high black curtains and tight air defense, the hope of prosperity has once again turned into a bubble.

From October 1st, people from enemy countries such as Britain and the United States should wear special identification badges when they go out. This move may cause the business of general cafes, dance halls, cinemas, etc., to decline temporarily.

Recently, Japanese-language "China Information" expressed deep dissatisfaction with the excessively high prices of dishes and meals in restaurants, believing that strict suppression is necessary.

The sales agencies of Japanese tobacco companies in Shanghai are: Wasen Company for Toyo Tobacco Company, Yongtailong Company for Gongcheng Tobacco Company, Kaiyuan Company for Toa Tobacco Company, and Wasen Xinghang for Koyo Tobacco Company. The manufacturing departments of these four Japanese tobacco companies have long been combined into the China Tobacco Co., Ltd. Their wholesale business is still handled by the above four companies. Recently, these four wholesale agencies have also been merged and reorganized and renamed China Tobacco Company Shanghai General Distribution Office Huayuan Tobacco Company, which has officially opened since the 25th.

Shanghai Electric Power Company previously implemented a dual-pricing system to save electricity, dividing the electricity consumption of users into two parts. One part is reduced by 20% based on their past electricity consumption records as the standard. The electricity bill within this standard amount is calculated at the original price and is not increased. If it exceeds this standard amount, it will be charged double the original price. The Japanese authorities are now considering abolishing this dual-pricing system, believing that this method is sufficient to prolong the reduction of working hours in factories. If it is abolished, it will help increase production. However, some people believe that the dual-pricing system in the past was aimed at taking into account both electricity saving and maintaining people's livelihood, so that residents who save electricity would not be affected by those who waste electricity and be subject to high prices. As for the reduction of working hours in various factories, the raw material panic is the biggest factor. High costs are more affected by high raw material prices. If the electricity bill calculation returns to a unified calculation method without increasing the price, it will be beneficial to people's livelihood and industrial production. If the dual-pricing system is abolished and the price increase is used to compensate for its losses, it may not be enough to promote increased production, but it will threaten people's livelihood. Therefore, everyone is paying close attention to it. However, in today's increasingly tight air defense, electricity consumption can be saved a lot, which makes it convenient to increase the power supply to facilitate cultivation.

After the Qingdao Exchange opened in the middle of this month, the prices of miscellaneous grains rose sharply. The exchange had to implement an additional security deposit of 1,500 yuan from the 17th. Therefore, 10,000 catties of oil require a security deposit of 5,500 yuan, and a cart of peanuts requires a security deposit of 6,000 yuan.

The Huazhong Flour United Association has signed a barter system with North China, stipulating that 5.18 million bags of flour should be supplied to North China this year. The first supply of 1.35 million bags has already been shipped out, and the second 1 million bags is now being loaded.

Ships under 100 tons were originally prohibited from coastal navigation. This prohibition has now been lifted by the relevant authorities. From September 22nd this year, ships and motorboats under 100 tons can be exported and operate in coastal transportation.

The Huazhong Flour United Association has signed a contract with the Japanese Feed Company to sell flour bran to Japan and has shipped it out six times. It is now scheduled to ship 78,000 bags (62 pounds per bag) to Japan for the seventh time in September and 61,000 bags to Japan for the eighth time in October.

The Shanghai Japanese Chamber of Commerce and Industry modified its organizational charter the day before yesterday and has been approved by the Consul General. According to this new charter, the Chamber has the power to guide various industrial and commercial organizations of Chinese people and has specially set up a secretariat to specialize in its affairs. Various public organizations of Chinese people, and even their relevant authorities, may have to adapt to the new system in terms of organizational system.

Chinese and Japanese sugar merchants jointly established the Shanghai Sugar Merchants Cooperative Business Office at the beginning of this year and recently further formed the Japan-China Sugar Industry Friendship Association. The union's executive Koyo Hoshi has been named honorary president, the Japanese merchant Sakaki Hatsugoro is the president, and the Chinese Tan Jiuru is the vice president.

The Suhuai area, centered on Xuzhou, is currently a special area economically. Under the leadership of the Japanese, a Suhuai area-to-Huazhong transfer and entry group with a capital of 2 million yuan in military tickets has been established to centrally handle the inland trade of the area with various ports.

Since the prohibition of speculative businesses, more and more people have invested in industry and commerce, and stock companies have sprung up like mushrooms after rain. There are already 120 companies in the association with varying amounts of capital. Wufu Company has a huge capital of 600,000. The participants are all leaders in the financial and industrial circles. The market is accurate, the transaction is fast, and the business is quite developed.

### Alive, Yet Dead

— Lu Ming

A person was lying on the bed near death, his bones withered, his face pale. A friend went to comfort him. That patient said, "Friend, don't be sad for me. I died twenty years ago."

A person whose heart is still beating, whose breathing has not stopped, who has skin, flesh, bones, and blood, died twenty years ago. This seems impossible, but we understand what he means. Twenty years ago, he lost his ideals and beliefs in life. He lost the spirit of fighting for justice and truth. He pursued gold and silver treasures, he pursued the satisfaction of flesh and blood, he pursued material enjoyment. He only had existence, not life. His conscience is gone. Although alive, he is dead.

Among the masses of beings, I don't know how many such walking corpses are floating. Friend, please ask yourself, are you still alive?

### Idle Talk and Being a Person

— Yunzi

My father was sick in the countryside. After the doctor's diagnosis, it was cholelithiasis complicated by cholecystitis, which required surgery. However, in this poor and remote place, where could surgical instruments be found? Therefore, I immediately accompanied my father to Shanghai for surgery. However, in the end, due to excessive gallbladder ulceration, it turned into blood poisoning and led to his death.

I am still just a child, always protected by my father. But from now on, I will be alone and helpless, groping my way onto the difficult path of the world. My father's death gave me a very big blow, and my sadness and grief are indescribable.

Returning to the countryside, I wanted to get some comfort from many relatives and friends, but comfort did not come. What came were many idle talks.

Some said that without surgery, he definitely wouldn't die.

Some said that without treatment by a Western doctor, he definitely wouldn't die.

Some said that without going to Shanghai, he definitely wouldn't die.

Some said that without catching a cold on the road, he definitely wouldn't die.

Some said

Listening to these endless idle talks added to my sadness. Could it be that as long as I followed their words, my father would not have died? If that were really the case, then I would be extremely sinful and suicide would not be enough to thank the elders of Jiangdong.

A few days later, I accidentally found in a medical book that the prognosis of cholelithiasis complicated by cholecystitis is generally poor, and surgery is the only treatment method. I suddenly thought that those many idle talks were not worth listening to. When we left our hometown and came to Shanghai, wouldn't these people who were talking idle talk all know that? However, was there anyone who dared to pat their chest and say, "You don't need to go to Shanghai. If there is a problem with this disease, I will be responsible?" No. At that time, everyone said that it would be good to go to Shanghai once.

I would rather that my father had not come to Shanghai for surgery and had been treated by a Chinese doctor at home. If he had died, then the people who are now talking idle talk would definitely have another set of words.

Some would say, "Why didn't you ask a Western doctor to see him? Seeing a Western doctor would definitely have been good."

Some would say, "Why didn't you go to Shanghai to take an X-ray? Maybe there is something in your stomach that can be removed by surgery."

Some would say

As long as my father died, there would always be a set of idle talks. I think this is probably because people's mouths are born for eating and talking.

However, when we are being people, we must first ruthlessly discard this endless idle talk and move forward bravely on the path of life. Otherwise, we will be in danger of being killed by these idle talks that kill without seeing blood.

Essay

### To Have Hope, One Must Have Faith

— Luo Lü

Everyone born into the world has a hope, and lives day by day with this hope. If a person feels that being born into the world is meaningless, or even feels that it is better to die than live, it is because there is no hope in his life. A person who is tired of the world and commits suicide must commit suicide when he feels that everything is hopeless.

To have hope, one must have faith. A person who hopes that one day he will ascend to heaven must believe in Jesus. He believes that God will definitely save him. A person who eats vegetarian food and chants Buddhist scriptures, his only hope is to cultivate sons and grandsons so that he will enter the Western Paradise after a hundred years and will not fall into the eighteen levels of hell. In order to maintain this hope, he believes in the absolute faith of the Bodhisattva, even to the point of superstition. A person who sells dog racing tickets, his hope is to get a huge amount of prize money. He buys tickets for dog number three because he believes that number three will definitely run out. Being a person is also the same. We hope to reach a state of hope that we desire in the future. We want to improve. We must first have a firm belief in our own career and that we will succeed.

A person who has hope and faith has an unlimited future.

### Group Ice Skating Lessons

— Kezhong

Mr. Smith, the manager of the American Spring City Ice Skating Rink, saw that beginners often fell and were often seriously injured. Therefore, he specially designed a kind of floating ladder with three wheels under it, which can be led by a coach in front while teaching five or six beginners at the same time, so that people who learn to skate first get the knack of balancing their bodies and then act alone to avoid the danger of falling and bumping. It is heard that ordinary beginners only need to learn in this kind of floating ladder three times to be able to skate freely on the ice.

### Business Sutra

— Wu Dai

In business, making friends is as important as making money. A smile spent in the store is equal to an income of one dollar.

You have to fall in love with your work every day, break through some difficulties, and finally you will surely become a lover with success.

Saving money is about spending money when you have money, and spending money is also about spending money when you have money. If you save money well and spend money well, you will make money well.

### Sharing a Boat in the Storm

— He Jia Zhi

(9) Hell on Earth

Wei Shaoyun busy threw the incense stick on the floor and laughed, "It's good that she knows I'm powerful, let her rest." As soon as he let go, Cuizhen slumped onto the bed. After another ten or so minutes, Cuizhen woke up slowly and only heard Wei Shaoyun saying, "We have punishment and reward. Just now was punishment, now it should be reward." He wrung out a handkerchief and wiped her face. "I'm a muddlehead. I took her from the Ye family of Shidetang and raised her for four or five days without letting her rest properly, letting her starve, thirst, worry, and be sad. I guess that when she was raised in the hands of that bookworm in the Ye family, her face must have been stronger than it is now." The thugs responded with a roar. One person was a veteran of two dynasties. He followed Fei Changhe to rob Cuizhen from the Ye family to the Wei family, and then followed Wei Shaoyun to rob Cuizhen from the Wei family to this place, the Sheng family. So he laughed and said, "What Young Master Wei said is right. This girl's cheeks on both sides in Shidetang were like half-ripe apples. Now these two sides have sunk in. But I believe that she will become full again in less than ten days as Young Master's young wife, haha."

Wei Shaoyun said, "The handkerchief has been wrung out and her face has been wiped, right? Let me see and feed her a sip of Western ginseng soup." Just now Wei Shaoyun ordered to wring out the handkerchief, which could be done immediately. Now that he ordered Western ginseng soup, they looked at each other. Wei Shaoyun's sister, Aying, squeezed out of the crowd and laughed, "Western ginseng soup, brother, there isn't any in our house. Last month, my mother wanted to steal three or five branches from my father's drawer to give to me, but I was afraid that if it was discovered, it would implicate my mother, so I didn't dare to ask for it. Now there isn't any in our house." Wei Shaoyun snorted in his nose and said, "Taking a few branches of Western ginseng is taking it. You even say it's stealing, dealing with women is really not a good thing. Now that there is no Western ginseng, feed her a little boiled water and let her swallow it slowly." This order was easy to carry out. Aying personally went to the kitchen to get boiled water and sat on the edge of the bed, feeding Cuizhen a spoonful at a time. Cuizhen swallowed two or three mouthfuls and pursed her lips, and the boiled water flowed down her neck. Wei Shaoyun said, "Enough, wipe her neck." (188)
