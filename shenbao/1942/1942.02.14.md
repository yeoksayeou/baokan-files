### Japan Intensifies Siege of Singapore, Only Three Miles from the City Center, Fierce Fighting Still Underway in the Northwest of the City, British Army Determined to Defend the City to the Death

Singapore Suburbs, 13th (Allied News Agency) – Japanese forces are attacking Singapore City and are now only three kilometers from the city center. Since early this morning, British and Japanese forces have been engaged in fierce fighting in and around the racecourse northwest of the city. The Japanese siege is gradually intensifying, and the British army is determined to defend the city to the death to protect British prestige. The Japanese army is also engaged in bayonet fighting amidst the rumbling of artillery and the clatter of machine guns.

Tokyo, 13th (Allied News Agency) – The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 1:00 PM today that Japanese army aircraft bombed a 10,000-ton ship full of soldiers docked in Singapore Harbor yesterday, and also hit a 3,000-ton ship, which immediately caught fire and burned. In addition, nine ships ranging from 1,000 to 7,000 tons were hit.

Tokyo, 13th (Haitong News Agency) – According to news from here today, Japanese forces who entered Singapore City from the north have now occupied the Singapore Governor's residence and administrative offices. According to the latest news, fierce street fighting is now taking place in Singapore, and British and Australian troops are still resisting stubbornly. According to Japanese sources, since last night, the enemy commander has been unable to deploy his troops to stop the Japanese advance. The second battlefield is in the center of the island, where enemy forces are desperately resisting between the two reservoirs. The Japanese army is attacking from all sides, so the British position is very precarious. Another unit of the Japanese army, after occupying the racecourse, is now approaching Kallang Airport. It is reported that the British coastal artillery batteries in Changi have been silenced.

Singapore, 13th (Reuters) – In the past 24 hours, Japanese pressure has remained most intense on the western front, with air force and artillery support. Large numbers of Japanese aircraft have been dropping bombs on various parts of the city from high altitude. The current battle locations are on the line from An Mo Kio village to the MacRitchie Reservoir and the Peirce Reservoir.

London, 12th (Reuters) – At 10:00 PM tonight (Singapore time), the Singapore radio station was still broadcasting news programs as usual. The announcer said that the Japanese army dropped surrender leaflets from aircraft for the second time at 7:00 AM this morning, but the British army did not respond. Fighting in the northwest of Singapore Island has slowed down slightly, and there has been less Japanese activity in the east. Singapore was bombed twice this morning.

British Defense Forces Shorten the Battle Lines

Singapore, 13th (Reuters) – Singapore is still in battle. The British army has shortened the battle lines from the naval base to the southern end of the island. Although Japanese aircraft are covering tanks and infantry in an attempt to attack, the situation is constantly changing.

London, 12th (Reuters) – Regarding the situation in Singapore after midnight yesterday, new information has been obtained. The northernmost British front line crosses the two reservoirs of Singapore. The Japanese army has continued to exert significant pressure on this line. The British counterattack launched the day before yesterday achieved considerable success on the left flank, but the Japanese then attacked with a large force, forcing the British to retreat again. When this news was received, it was widely believed that the two northernmost reservoirs were still in British hands. The Japanese army is probably able to use the causeway, but this is under constant and heavy artillery fire. Although the Japanese claim to have occupied certain airfields, it is said that the Japanese cannot use any air bases on the island while this battle is in progress.

Tokyo, 13th (Reuters) – According to Tokyo broadcasts, British warships have opened fire and bombed British oil tanks and military facilities in Singapore. The British are clearly trying to leave nothing intact for the Japanese army. It is reported that thirty British ships have gathered in Singapore Harbor and Port Swettenham to the southwest of the area, ready for British troops to escape by ship at the last moment. According to the "Asahi Shimbun," British troops are resisting desperately in the rubber plantations north and east of Singapore City. Also, the "Nichinichi Shimbun" states that the Japanese army on Singapore Island has launched a large-scale pincer attack on the Sembawang Naval Base in the north of the island.

American Concerns About the Far East War Situation

Washington, 12th (Havas) – Regarding the Far East situation, several members of Congress have commented, saying that the military situation in the Pacific is becoming increasingly serious, and the fall of Singapore is "a major setback for the United States." Senator George, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, said that Singapore is a springboard, and Japan will devote all its efforts to attacking the Dutch East Indies and Rangoon. Both of these are strategically important points for the United States and the Allies. Senator Bailey of North Carolina said that the Allied forces have repeatedly suffered setbacks in the Pacific War in the past two months, which may create a kind of "defeatism" in the minds of the general public, and we must pay attention to this. In addition, Senator Walsh, chairman of the Senate Naval Affairs Committee, also warned the people of the country that it would take a year and a half to prepare for an effective offensive.

Washington, 12th (Havas) – News from Singapore is becoming increasingly unfavorable. As of this afternoon, most people here believe that it is an undeniable fact that the British army cannot resist on its final defense line for more than forty hours. According to the latest news, the current battle line in Singapore runs from the Johore Causeway to the naval base in the east, passing through the northern reservoirs and traversing the entire island. Although the Johore Causeway has been repaired by Japanese engineers, it is still within range of British artillery fire. Heavy artillery battles have occurred near the urban area this morning, unprecedented since the start of the war. Japanese aircraft are also actively operating, constantly bombing the northern suburbs of the city.

British Negligence is Undeniable

New York, 12th (Havas) – Brown, a reporter for CBS News stationed in Singapore, repeatedly delivered radio speeches a week ago, saying that Britain was unprepared in its "Far East Gibraltar," and was expelled by the British authorities. In a radio speech broadcast on the Sydney radio station, he said, "The British authorities in Singapore have always believed that Japan would never dare to attack Britain. When the Pacific War broke out, Britain was completely unprepared. Although officials said they were prepared to deal a head-on blow, those in charge never thought about how to stop it. Therefore, the fall of Singapore was due to British inertia, negligence, and lack of preparation. Because the distance of space could not constitute an obstacle to the Japanese army, the Allies had nothing to block the Japanese advance. At this point, Japanese submarines are preparing to operate in the Indian Ocean. Rangoon's situation is already extremely critical, and the situation in Sumatra is also very dangerous. The fate of Java will probably be known within three weeks. At that time, the Commonwealth of Australia will also be attacked. Recalling the time in Singapore, every time I met pilots, they would ask me to tell the world that there were many Japanese aircraft, far more than the Allies. The British army in Singapore fought bravely everywhere. Although unprepared, they still resisted resolutely. This spirit is commendable. However, the British authorities have always believed that Japan would never dare to attack until after three weeks of the "Malayan War," when British military experts realized that the Japanese light tanks and light armored vehicles could cross the flooded rice fields. In addition, the number of British troops was far less than the Japanese army, and the British were completely unprepared for jungle warfare. In terms of their physical condition, they were also unable to continue fighting in the equatorial region for three weeks. Moreover, the Fifth Column was also very active. A large amount of food was not destroyed at all, resulting in it falling into the hands of the Japanese army. Ferries, small boats, and even ships were not sunk, and were captured by the Japanese army. The most incredible thing is that the tax bureau safe on Heng Island contained $250,000 in cash that was not destroyed and was given to the Japanese army in its entirety. The local radio station was also intact and occupied by the Japanese army. When the British authorities ordered the evacuation of civilians, it was limited to Europeans and Americans. Malays, Indians, and overseas Chinese were ignored, which immediately caused strong resentment. For example, although the British talked about implementing a "scorched earth policy," it was actually self-deception. For example, in Kelantan, forty-eight hours after the British army withdrew from the local airfield, if aircraft had been dispatched to bomb the hangars and other facilities... Overseas Chinese leaders repeatedly requested the British to allow overseas Chinese to participate in the war, but rifles were only distributed at the last moment, but it was too late and ultimately ineffective. As for news censorship, it was extremely strict, suppressing the truth and making the people of Singapore ignorant of the true situation. In short, the Japanese army has now invaded Singapore. Tracing the common cause, it is probably due to the British lack of foresight and failure to prepare in advance. The fall of Singapore is a great lesson for us."

### A Glimpse of Singapore Architecture

Although Singapore is a small island, its residents are very complex. This can be seen from the various different buildings there. (Top) is the Governor's Palace, a tall building that quite conveys the Governor's authority. (Bottom) are the grass huts and thatched houses inhabited by Malays, which appear greatly inferior in comparison.

### Burma Front, Little Change in the War Situation, Air Forces of Both Sides Extremely Active

Burma Front, 12th (Allied News Agency) – According to front-line reports today, the Japanese elite troops crossed the Salween River at Pa-an and Moulmein at midnight on the 8th of this month, and after occupying Martaban, they are now advancing forward.

London, 13th (Havas) – Responsible parties here have just announced that there has been little change in the war situation in Burma.

London, 13th (Reuters) – Responsible persons in London said today that no new news has come from Singapore. It is believed that Japanese troops in Burma still occupy Martaban on the west bank of the Salween River (ninety miles east of Rangoon).

Rangoon, 13th (Reuters) – The British Air Force Command announced yesterday that British bombers, covered by Allied fighters, assisted army units in attacking in eastern Burma on the morning of the 11th of this month.

### Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek in India, Meets with Nehru Again, Madame Chiang Kai-shek Addresses the All-India Women's Conference

New Delhi, 13th (Reuters) – Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek met with Indian National Congress leader Nehru for the third time yesterday.

Saigon, 13th (Haitong News Agency) – While General Chiang Kai-shek was in India discussing matters with National Congress leader Nehru, his wife attended a public meeting for the first time since arriving in India yesterday, namely the All-India Women's Conference convened by the National Congress. Madame Chiang Kai-shek delivered a speech on the traditional relationship between China and India.

Benares, 13th (Reuters) – Indian poetess Madame Naidu will rush to New Delhi tomorrow to meet with Generalissimo and Madame Chiang Kai-shek.

Stockholm, 13th (Haitong News Agency) – London dispatches state that General Chiang Kai-shek's visit to India to help resolve the Indian issue has apparently intensified domestic political disputes in Britain. Many British Conservatives say that the Chinese leader's mission in India should be limited to discussing military issues related to the defense of Burma and India. Opposition figures, on the other hand, say that given the current situation in the Far East, the Indian issue cannot be resolved without Chiang Kai-shek's cooperation and British concessions. Opposition figures went on to say that the attitude of white people towards the natives is the cause of today's failures. The loss of Malaya and Singapore is also rooted in this. If the British authorities do not quickly change their attitude towards India, India will one day secede from Britain. Moreover, during the Sino-Japanese War, the people of Asia have proven themselves to be excellent soldiers, but they are unwilling to provide any assistance for the benefit of foreigners. Today, it is urgent to urge General Chiang Kai-shek to obtain India's satisfaction, and at the same time unconditionally guarantee India's participation in the Anglo-American operation. In short, opposition figures have high hopes for the Chinese leader's mission in India, but the attitude of Churchill and his cabinet towards this matter is unknown. It is heard that Cripps is quite involved with propaganda that praises Chiang's mission, and it is even rumored that Cripps discussed this plan with the Chinese leader during his visit to Chongqing.

Berlin, 12th (Havas) – A semi-official statement was issued regarding General Chiang Kai-shek's visit to India, commenting that Chiang's trip is still an attempt to salvage the situation in the event of an emergency. The United States has gladly granted new loans to China, hoping that China will run errands for it. In addition, Britain and India are currently in negotiations. Since Japan's great victory, these countries have been overwhelmed. Japan, for its part, is happy to liberate India and free it from British shackles.

### Wang Ying-yu Talks About the Inspection of Kangqing

Chongqing, 13th – This reporter recently visited Wang Ying-yu, the leader of the Kangqing inspection team, to inquire about his impressions of this trip. He kindly made the following remarks: (1) The compatriots in Kang Prefecture of Xikang and south of the Riyue Mountains in Qinghai Province are deeply influenced by Buddhism, are respectful and courteous, and are optimistic in everything. The Hui compatriots in Qinghai are particularly disciplined, strong and respectful to their elders. The compatriots in that area are able to endure hardship and adapt to changes. (2) The Bayan Har Mountains are a vast plateau. If the power of religion and politics can be used, it can be a vast and good pasture. (3) Transportation is an important tool for all construction, and the construction of the Qingchuan, Qingkang, and Qingyu lines is not difficult and is of great importance to the national economy and the people's livelihood. (4) The strength of Xikang Province and the forestry and transportation construction of Qinghai Province are showing an upward trend. (5) Education east of Kangding is quite developed, but the area should pay attention to production education. Education in Qinghai Province is quite developed, and religion and schools are gradually moving towards coexistence. The great impartiality of Qinghai's politics is especially admirable. (6) Buddhists have lofty ideas, and Muslims are practical in their words and deeds. The outside world thinks that compatriots in the border areas value face. This kind of observation is not very accurate.

### Major Battle Between British and German Naval and Air Forces Near the Strait of Dover, Number of Aircraft Involved in the Battle Reaches Over 600, German Fleet Retreats to Heligoland

London, 13th (Reuters) – A major naval battle between the British and German fleets has taken place near the Strait of Dover. According to the Admiralty's announcement today, the German battleships Scharnhorst and Gneisenau (26,000 tons each) and the cruiser Prinz Eugen, covered by a large number of auxiliary ships and aircraft, were attacked near the Strait of Dover. Our side participated in the attack with several destroyers and torpedo boats, and many naval and air force aircraft. The Dover coastal defense batteries also opened fire to provide long-range support. As of now, 20 British bombers and 16 fighters have been shot down. German losses include at least 18 fighters. The outcome is still awaiting further reports. London, 13th (Reuters) – The Admiralty and the Air Ministry jointly issued a battle report this morning, stating, "At approximately 11:00 AM yesterday, Thursday, British Air Force reports stated that a German fleet had been spotted, including two battleships, the Scharnhorst and Gneisenau, and one cruiser, the Prinz Eugen, assisted by several destroyers, torpedo boats, and minesweepers, heading towards the Strait of Dover from the west. The fleet was covered by a large number of fighters. At that time, visibility was approximately three to five miles, and the cloud cover was very low. It was extremely difficult to see these ships from the British coast. After receiving the report, the Dover coastal defense command, the naval air force, and air force fighter groups immediately set out to attack. All German ships and fighters returned fire with intense firepower. It is reported that at least one German battleship and one torpedo boat were hit by our aircraft's bombs. However, due to the German ships' fire net and smoke screen, the outcome was difficult to ascertain. At approximately 1:45 PM, several of our destroyers caught a glimpse of the German fleet and attacked it. German aircraft and warships also returned fire with intense firepower. The outcome was also uncertain due to unclear visibility and dense fire net. The last glimpse of the German fleet showed it dispersing and heading towards Heligoland Bight and other ports. Details are still awaiting further reports."

Berlin, 13th (Haitong News Agency) – German officials revealed that when German ships were sailing in the English Channel yesterday, British aircraft launched a large-scale attack. The number of aircraft involved in the battle sometimes reached over 600, which is rare. The English Channel is not very wide, with the narrowest part being only 30 kilometers wide. British aircraft attacked during the day, but German ships were able to safely navigate through.

German Headquarters, 13th (Haitong News Agency) – A German war report this afternoon stated that yesterday, German ships engaged British forces in the English Channel and the western part of the North Sea. The German side had the pocket battleships "Scharnhorst" and "Gneisenau" and the cruiser "Prinz Eugen." One British destroyer was sunk, and another destroyer caught fire. A large squadron of British air force attacked the German fleet but was repelled by the German side. The British lost 43 aircraft, mostly shot down by German aircraft during air combat. The German side lost only 7 aircraft. One German torpedo boat was lightly damaged, and one patrol boat was sunk. German fighter groups attacked airfields on the southern coast of England at low altitude, dropping several heavy bombs.

London, 13th (Havas) – The German ships that participated in the naval battle in the Strait of Dover, the "Scharnhorst," is a 26,000-ton battleship, equipped with nine 11-inch guns, twelve 5.9-inch guns, and thirty anti-aircraft guns, carrying four aircraft. In peacetime, it has a crew of 1,461 officers and men and a speed of 30 knots per hour. It was completed in Wilhelmshaven in January 1939 and was the first formal battleship built by the German Navy since the last European war. The "Gneisenau" is the "sister ship" of the "Scharnhorst" and was completed later than the "Scharnhorst." The "Prinz Eugen" is one of the five 10,000-ton heavy cruisers of the "Hipper" class, which began construction in 1936 and was completed in early 1941. The ship is equipped with eight 8-inch guns, twelve 4.5-inch anti-aircraft guns, and four aircraft, with a crew of 830 officers and men.

### Changes in the Far East War Situation Cause Internal British Anxiety: Beli Xia and Two Others Announce Their Withdrawal from the Party; Beaverbrook Explains the Key Points of Wartime Production

London, 12th Dispatch: It is learned here that Prime Minister Churchill will broadcast to the nation on the evening of the 15th, outlining the situation in Singapore and the general war situation. Churchill will also deliver a speech in the House of Commons. Public dissatisfaction with the government's handling of the war situation is increasing. Important members of the Liberal Party, Granville and Beli Xia, have both announced their withdrawal from the party. Granville stated that "We believe that in order to achieve victory in the war, the current government must be reorganized and the current policies must be improved." As a result of the House of Commons' discussion of the war situation, it is generally believed that if Rangoon and Martaban are not defended, Prime Minister Churchill's personal position may be shaken. It is generally believed that after Ambassador to the Soviet Union Cripps returns home, he will have the reputation of a "well-intentioned critic" of government policies, and is now surrounded by Cripps, it is said.

London, 12th, Havas News Agency: Liberal Party members of parliament Beli Xia (former Secretary of War), Granville, and Jones sent a letter to the Liberal Party today, announcing their withdrawal from the party. It stated that Granville and Jones did not attend the vote when the House of Commons passed a motion of confidence in the government. The National Executive Committee of the Liberal Party immediately raised questions and requested an explanation. However, we believe that the policies implemented by the current cabinet are obviously not strong enough to enable our country to win in the current war. Therefore, we have repeatedly demanded and strived for wartime production, especially aircraft production, to immediately exceed the current level. The Executive Committee did not investigate and instead raised questions. We can only announce our withdrawal from the party. Beli Xia also announced his withdrawal from the party at the same time to show solidarity, it is said. Granville also said that he and Jones will still attend the House of Commons as independent Liberal Party members and continue to advocate for the organization of a truly national unity cabinet that can recruit domestic talents regardless of party affiliation, it is said.

London, 12th, Havas Dispatch: Minister of Wartime Production Lord Beaverbrook delivered a speech in the House of Lords today, explaining the key points of wartime production. He stated that when representatives from the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union held a meeting in Moscow, he discussed the allocation and handling of armaments with the American representative Harriman. At that time, he planned to establish a wartime production department. Later, the United Kingdom and the United States held a meeting in Washington and decided to jointly use all the resources of the two countries. Therefore, the proposal to establish a wartime production department was largely decided. It is a revolutionary action to jointly use the resources of the two countries. It is necessary not only to gather the armaments manufactured by the United Kingdom, the United States, and other Allied countries in one place, but also to establish a joint organization to control these armaments. All the raw materials we have must also be gathered in one place. As for the specific work of the wartime production department, I may go to Moscow and Washington. Only in this way can the joint organization in Washington make accurate decisions. The outside world does not understand the truth. Recently, due to inconvenient transportation, raw materials will be our main source in the future. The US government should study the needs of the UK, the US, and the Soviet Union. In short, our workers can go all out for any call from the government. The outside world does not understand and often says that workers are not working hard, which is not true, it is said.

However, by the morning of the 6th, they were finally repelled by our Allied forces to the east of the city of Kharkov. Regarding the enemy's advance, our vanguard troops have always reported at any time, so their offensive can often be stopped immediately.

The new military results will be unimaginable. Churchill's fate is tied to this battle. Singapore is the hub of the Indian Ocean and the Pacific Ocean. It is in a very important position. Now that it has been occupied by the Japanese army, the Japanese army has achieved a major victory in military strategy. Therefore, all signatory countries to the Tripartite Pact should congratulate Japan. In short, the fall of Singapore and the success of the Axis powers in North Africa are the results of the Tripartite Pact," it is said.

### Wavell on Military Talent (1)

This article is the original manuscript of three lectures given by General Wavell at Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1939 at the invitation of the Lees Knowles Foundation. The translation is as follows:

1.  The Virtues That a General Should Possess

I am very honored to be invited by you to give a lecture here. Military topics are usually limited to a certain battle or a certain period in history, but I am going to make a broad discussion on army generals and military talents. I think that starting with this topic, the points I want to make about the study of war history are easier to understand than just looking at certain individual battles. I think there are very few of you who expect to be generals in the future; but many people will inevitably serve the country under the command of generals, or sing triumphantly, and everyone will definitely have the opportunity to evaluate the merits and demerits of generals. So I hope that you will first have substantial and broad knowledge, and then criticize based on evidence. Since the last war, British military talents have been criticized by public opinion. Even now, I am afraid that the British public's perception of generals is still the same as the impression given by the "Sterling Machine" boasting its effectiveness on street posters. I am not trying to defend the generals, but to examine the qualifications that a general should possess and the various situations when he performs his duties.

What exactly are the qualifications necessary for a high-ranking commander? To answer this question, I have traced history and pursued many definitions of predecessors. I have dabbled in various works that discuss the qualifications of generals, whether military or non-military. But there is only one saying that I think deeply understands the key, which is said to be from the philosopher Socrates, who answered:

A general must know how to obtain soldiers, food, and other war equipment. He must have both the imagination to plan strategies and the ability to be down-to-earth and persevere to complete his plans. He must be careful, hard-working, and discerning; kind and tolerant; frank and skillful; as strict as a prison guard when guarding, and as aggressive as a robber when attacking; not afraid of waste but also knowing how to be frugal; as generous as the sea but sometimes narrow-minded; as quiet as a virgin, and as swift as a rabbit when moving. All these qualities, whether from natural endowments or acquired later, must be possessed by those who command troops. In addition, he must be proficient in tactics: because a mob cannot become an army, just as bricks and tiles cannot be called a house.

The first thing that catches my attention in this definition is the order. It starts with the affairs of management: it already points to the matter of military talent, which really wins my heart: the ability to use tactics in combat is placed last, which is exactly the opposite of most opinions. The definition also lists practical knowledge and perseverance as two extremely important qualifications: followed by a long list of virtues that a general should possess, in pairs, which shows that the scope of activities involved in military talent is very broad, and the situation is extremely changeable. Therefore, we know how much the general's character needs the ability to adapt to the environment.

But in my opinion, even Socrates' definition has not truly stated the first element of a general, which is the ability to persevere and endure any setbacks in war. Perhaps in Socrates' time, this responsibility was not yet so important, and people would not be "agitated" like they are now. To understand the meaning of the perseverance I am talking about, it is best to listen to me give a practical example. (To be continued)

### Exact Number of People in the International Settlement: More Than 1,580,000, Including More Than 1,520,000 Chinese. The Household Registration of the French Concession Was Also Completed Last Night

The Intelligence Office of the Municipal Council announced, "The household registration of the International Settlement has been completed from the 1st to the 8th of this month. The results are as follows:

Germans × The so-called Germans do not refer to those who are completely of German nationality.

Household Registration Outside the Settlement Is Still Under Investigation

The household registration procedures for the French Concession were completed yesterday afternoon, and the statistical work has begun. Therefore, there is an accurate number of the exact population of the two settlements this year. The investigation of foreigners in the area of the roads outside the settlement in West Shanghai is still in progress. According to official estimates, it will still take about a week to complete.

### Flood Control Plan: Expenses of Five Million Yuan, Can Be Completed Within Five Years

In order to avoid flooding in the International Settlement, the Municipal Council has obtained the cooperation of the Japanese authorities and will invest 5 million yuan to improve the drainage system of the city. It will take about three to five years. In recent years, the problem of water accumulation on low-lying roads has become more and more serious, because the ditches in the industrial area of West Shanghai are flooded and the Suzhou Creek and Huangpu River are silted up. According to the plan of the Municipal Council, the areas that are most severely affected will be the first to start work. At the same time, the Shanghai Dredging Bureau will also cooperate with the Municipal Council to actively dredge the Suzhou Creek and Huangpu River.

### No Travel Permits Issued on Lunar New Year's Day

The Intelligence Office of the Municipal Council announced that the nine offices of the Bureau that issue return home travel permits will be closed for one day on Sunday, the 15th of this month. Starting from Monday, they will resume normal office hours and issue permits.

### Kidnapped Travel Agency Partner, Extorted 10,000 Yuan

The Dahua Travel Agency at No. 13 Dongxin Bridge Street, French Concession, was established by Yu Tongsheng from Danyang. On the 8th of this month, Shen Ronggen, a ruffian from Pudong, 31 years old, and Chen Zijun, a local, 32 years old, went to the agency together and asked Yu to borrow 10,000 yuan in legal tender, otherwise they would be unfavorable to him. Yu refused to let them go because he had no dealings with Shen and others. Unexpectedly, at 5:00 p.m. the next day, Shen and others went to the agency again. The owner of the agency happened to be out. Shen and others kidnapped Yu's cousin, Yi Tongqing, 19 years old, to Room 220 of the Dahai Hotel on Avenue Edward VII. They called the travel agency and demanded that the money be paid immediately. The owner of the agency answered the phone and pretended to敷衍敷衍允, limited one hour to raise the money, and reported to the French Concession Police, ordering detectives to come and wait. After an hour, Shen and others really came to collect the money and were arrested by the detectives. After questioning, they learned the whole story. They rescued the hostage at the Dahai Hotel and took the accomplice Zhu Shuming, who was guarding the hostage, to the Pudong Police Station. The defendants confessed that the owner of the travel agency, Yu Tongsheng, was selling fake travel permits and deceiving passengers. Therefore, they had contacted him. They did not dare to extort money. The rest of the confessions were vague. They were ordered to be detained and await further investigation.

### The Temperature Dropped to Four Degrees Below Zero, Many Poor People Froze to Death, It Is Expected to Be Sunny Today, But the Cold Will Not Abate

The weather in the city suddenly turned extremely cold in the past few days, especially yesterday. The minimum temperature dropped to 4.4 degrees Celsius below freezing, which is 24.1 degrees Fahrenheit. Around 10:00 a.m., snowflakes were flying, and it stopped after a while. It was freezing all day and did not thaw. It was the first extremely cold day of this year. However, the air pressure rose in the afternoon, and it is expected to be sunny and cold today.

Cold Wave Strikes Shanghai for Four Days and Nights

Charitable organizations in the city are currently cooperating to rescue homeless poor people. However, according to the two settlements' corpse collection offices, in the past four nights, the cold wave struck Shanghai, and 810 poor people still froze to death on the streets. There were many corpses collected in the International Settlement. Even in the severe cold of last year, there was no such phenomenon.

More Than Eight Hundred Poor People Froze to Death

On the night of the 9th of this month, the weather was extremely cold. The International Settlement collected 144 corpses on the road, including 80 real corpses. On the same night, 73 corpses were found on the road in the French Concession. On the 12th night, there were 64 adult corpses and 65 child corpses on the road in the International Settlement. There were 28 adult corpses and 30 child corpses on the road in the French Concession, totaling 187 corpses. On the 10th of this month, there were 194 corpses on the road in the two settlements. On the 11th, there were 212 corpses. The cold wave that struck Shanghai was the main reason for the large increase in corpses on the road. There were few who died of starvation. Although charitable organizations provided clothing and porridge, it was still not enough to cope with the situation. This winter, there have never been as many as 810 corpses collected on the road in the two settlements in the past four nights. The closest number was in the coldest week of December, but the total number was still less than 810. As for foreigners, none have frozen to death on the road.

### Today, the Tram Will Extend Service Hours Until 2:00 a.m.

Yesterday, it was learned from the tram companies in the two settlements that the Shanghai Tramway Company has decided to extend the operating hours of trams and trolleybuses today until 12:00 p.m., so that factories and businesses can collect and settle accounts. However, after 9:00 p.m., the fares for all vehicles will be charged at the first-class fare. Although the French Tramway Company has not decided on this method of extending the operating hours, it will also follow the example of the British Tramway Company and extend the shifts to facilitate public transportation.

### Municipal Council Staff Salaries Reduced Again: Annual Savings of 7 Million Yuan

The Municipal Council has been actively implementing expenditure cuts due to financial difficulties and budget deficits, and has especially focused on personnel. Since January of this year, the salaries of Municipal Council staff have been reduced. The salaries of staff in January were divided into four levels: the lowest salary for unmarried staff was 1,500 yuan per person, the lowest salary for married staff was 2,500 yuan, 3,000 yuan for married staff with one child, and 3,500 yuan for married staff with two or more children. Since this standard was implemented, a total of 2 million yuan in expenditures has been reduced. In February, the lowest salary will be reduced again to four levels: 500 yuan, 1,000 yuan, 1,300 yuan, and 1,500 yuan. After such a salary reduction, it is estimated that 7 million yuan in expenditures can be saved.

### Nightclubs Apply for Late Closing Hours

The Municipal Council received applications yesterday morning from nightclub owners requesting to extend business hours until midnight on Saturdays, Sundays, and public holidays (including Lunar New Year). It is currently being studied. The public believes that the Municipal Council's response will be announced soon, as tomorrow is the first day of the Lunar New Year. Although officials cannot predict before a decision is made by the special committee studying the matter, the responsible authorities do not believe that this new application will be approved. Those who submitted this application are several nightclubs in the International Settlement. However, this issue applies to all nightclubs in the settlement. In their new petition, the nightclub owners also guarantee that they will abide by the electricity consumption restrictions after obtaining approval.

### Shenbao Initiative: Student Aid Fund Donation Report

Yesterday, we continued to receive donations from enthusiastic people from all walks of life, including Zhu Hua 100 yuan, Deng Guorong 2 shillings, Yang Baoji 7 yuan 1 jiao 5 fen, totaling 127 yuan 1 jiao 5 fen. The previous balance of 63,115 yuan 5 jiao 9 fen, totaling 63,242 yuan 7 jiao 4 fen.

### Lending Money at Usurious Interest Rates Leads to Death

Wu Laotou, who used to run a fruit stall at Lao Beimen, was 73 years old. His stepwife had also passed away, leaving behind a son and an adopted daughter-in-law, each only 13 years old. Due to the impact of the war, the three of them had no way to make a living. Now it is the end of the lunar year, and the usurious interest that he owed before was being extorted endlessly, and he was threatened. The old man could not bear the persecution and hanged himself yesterday. The heavy exploitation of usurious interest is truly a so-called killing without a knife.

### Counterfeit Money Selling Gang Cracked, Defendants Sentenced Separately

On the 29th of last month, Chinese and foreign detectives from the Hongkou Police Station cracked a case of selling and using counterfeit money at No. 15 Dakang Lane, Shandong Road and Kangti Road, French Concession, arresting 11 suspects, including Li Defeng, Zhang Yonghua, and the woman Shen Cai. 20 ten-yuan banknotes from the Bank of Communications were seized. It was found that Zhang was a habitual offender and admitted that he had sold thousands of this type of money in other cities and in the city. Because the manufacturing was exquisite and similar to the real ones, only money shops, banks, and cigarette shops could see that they were counterfeits. Countless people suffered. The police filed a public prosecution for the crime of using and selling counterfeit currency and requested severe punishment. Yesterday, the case was sentenced to five years of imprisonment for Li Defeng and Zhang Hua, two years for Li Deshun, Lu Yonghe, Shen Cai, and Fei Wu, and Yao Changgen, Shen Wu, Wang Xie, and others were acquitted and released. The counterfeit money was confiscated.

### The Silver and Money Industry Completes Year-End Closing Today; Business Hours Extended; Spring Festival Holiday for Four Days, Reopening on the 19th

The silver and money industry in this city has decided on a method for the year-end closing for the 30th year. All banks and money houses will extend their business hours until 5:00 PM today (Lunar New Year's Eve). The time for accepting checks will also be extended by two hours compared to usual. Interest rates for money houses have already been closed yesterday. Therefore, starting tomorrow (the 15th), banks and money houses will follow the usual practice of taking a four-day Spring Festival holiday, reopening for business on the 19th. Exchange houses and money exchange houses will report to the market and resume trading on that day.

All Industry Markets Close for Business

Regarding spot and futures trading in various industry markets, most markets have already closed down business successively due to the Lunar New Year approaching, to handle the year-end closing for the 30th year. It is understood that a small number of markets have also stopped trading today as it is Lunar New Year's Eve, and outstanding transactions urgently need to be cleared up.

### Special Martial Law for One Week

As the Lunar New Year approaches, commercial firms and both the banking and money industries are actively handling year-end closing, and the handover of cash will inevitably increase compared to usual. To prevent bandits and petty thieves from taking advantage of the situation to rob, both concessions have adopted special precautions starting yesterday. Chinese and Western detectives from each police station have been instructed to patrol important roads, closely monitor suspicious pedestrians, and arrest any lawbreakers at any time to ensure public safety. This special precaution will be extended for one week before being lifted.

### Fire on Route Tenant de la Tour Blanche

A fire broke out in a shed at a certain address on Route Tenant de la Tour Blanche near Route Cardinal Mercier in Western Shanghai at approximately 5:10 PM yesterday. Due to the wind fueling the flames, it could not be contained, and it burned for about an hour and a half. It is estimated that fifteen or sixteen sheds were burned down, but fortunately, no one was hurt.

### Lunar New Year; Rice Sales Suspended for Three Days

The Public Works Department has recently issued a notice stating that due to the Spring Festival, rice shops located in the Public Concession will suspend business for one week starting from the 15th of this month, except for Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday (the 15th, 16th, and 17th of this month). On other days, they will be allowed to sell rice. In addition, the rice distribution centers set up by the Bureau on Gordon Road, Fairness Road, and Washington Road will also follow the same procedures as above.

### Incorrect Medicine Dispensing Incident; Pharmacy Admits Mistake

Yan Tongde German Pharmacy, located at No. 233 Foch Road, mistakenly dispensed the medicine prescribed for a patient surnamed Ma, residing at No. 28 Avenue Notre Dame des Victories, to another person on the 2nd of this month. After the medicine was sent to the Ma family and taken, the patient's head swelled up like a bucket. The incident was reported to the French police, who detained the pharmacy owner, Yan Chang, and took him into custody. Details of the incident have been reported in previous newspapers. It is now learned that Yan Chang has entrusted a friend to mediate with the patient, admitting the mistake and willingly offering to pay for medical treatment until the patient recovers. All losses incurred will be fully borne by the German pharmacy. It is reported that both parties have now reached a peaceful resolution, and the police have been requested to drop the case. However, the police, considering that the pharmacy owner should not have neglected his duties, have leniently imposed a fine and released him.

### Young Woman Resists Robbery

Liang Meimei, a woman from Guangdong, lives at No. 2, Lane 538, Route Pichon. She was returning home alone at approximately 11:00 PM the night before last, when she encountered two robbers on Route Pichon near the Shangjia Garden area. They attempted to strip off Liang's coat, but she resisted strongly. As a result, she was stabbed in the arm with a sharp blade. In the end, the coat was stolen and the robbers escaped. The coat was worth four hundred yuan. Liang reported the incident to the police afterward.

It is sold in all bookstores.

### Time Hurries, the Year Declines: The Growing Unemployment Tide

— Zhang Ge

The terror of rice prices is already enough to make ordinary families anxious beyond measure. The coming of the unemployment tidal wave makes us wonder how many people will be swept into the vortex. Middle and lower class families, with fixed incomes, find them already insufficient to cover the expenses of clothing, food, housing, and transportation. Once unemployed, even the most basic of livelihoods will lose its basis. It is no different from being at the end of one's rope. The unemployment tidal wave makes them fall into the abyss. People who were already groaning under the heavy weight of life now have no room to struggle!

The Number of Unemployed Soars

The Industrial and Social Department of the Public Works Department stated in its survey report that the number of unemployed workers in the concession in January was more than 60,000. Compared with the population of the concession, the proportion is not very high, but in reality the number is already extremely alarming, because each worker has an average of four family members, and the unemployment of 60,000 people means that the lives of 240,000 people are in trouble. In January, although many factories planned to close due to a lack of raw materials and a reduction in electricity supply, most of them still waited and watched. Resolving personnel matters in a short period of time was also quite difficult, so the number of unemployed did not increase dramatically. February coincided with the end of the Lunar New Year, which is traditionally the time for various industries to handle year-end closings. Manufacturers who were generally waiting and watching will inevitably have to decide on their direction due to actual difficulties, and the step of closing down and dismissing all employees becomes inevitable. This trend is not limited to factories, but also applies to ordinary companies, firms, shops, and stores, so the number of unemployed in this month will definitely increase several times or even dozens of times compared to January. If we include the unemployed family members who are affected, the number of people suffering will be even greater. Although detailed figures are temporarily impossible to obtain, the surging and unstoppable nature of the unemployment tidal wave has become an undeniable and inevitable fact. Time hurries, the year declines. Every year has its cruel decorations, and the cruelty of this year is unprecedented in any previous year. As I write, I am lost in thought, and feel disheartened!

### Do Not Let Them End Up on the Streets

For families who no longer need to reside in Shanghai, returning to their hometowns is the only viable option. However, the dismissal fees or similar subsidies given to workers by general factories when they close down are often insufficient for the journey back to their hometowns. For example, a well-known rubber factory, which is larger than ordinary factories and is known for its scientific management, only provides 30 yuan to workers whose original home is in the Suzhou and Wuxi area, and only 70 yuan to those who are far away in Shandong Province. In today's low currency value, it is really unknown what those who are experiencing these conditions will use it for. Workers often cannot afford to return home due to the meager dismissal fees, and linger in Shanghai, hoping to regain a foothold. In a few days, they will spend all their income, and it is so difficult to find another job that they end up on the streets, struggling in the biting wind.

Hometown associations in Shanghai already have plans to assist residents of their hometowns in returning home, and many have already put them into practice, but economic support for unemployed workers is beyond their means, which is something that needs to be remedied by caring people from all walks of life. There are several charities that organize the sending of poor people back to their hometowns, such as the Sanjiao Daode Society, but due to insufficient economic resources, the effect is minimal. They have been appealing in newspapers for days, requesting those with the ability to help to provide assistance, but the response has not been very enthusiastic. Even though Shanghai is entering a difficult situation, the general wealthy class is still busy purchasing New Year's goods, hosting New Year's Eve dinners, giving New Year's money, and preparing for New Year's celebrations. If everyone could save unnecessary expenses and contribute them to reliable charities or hometown associations to pay for the travel expenses of unemployed workers and their families back to their hometowns, wouldn't that be a very meaningful act of kindness? Our compatriots are trapped in dire straits, and we cannot stand by and do nothing. This is our heartfelt appeal.

### Warehouses Unsealed, Yarn Market Continues to Rise

The cotton yarn market continued to rise. This is because the transport of yarn and cloth on the roads is unimpeded, and the yarn in the warehouses has been unsealed, so people's hearts are good. Sellers are lacking, and the market is rising. The initial price of 20s Shuangma Factory single was 2,010 yuan. It rose to 2,050 yuan in the middle, and then slightly weakened due to profit-takers, closing at 2,030 yuan. The price of 42s Lanfeng was 483 yuan, the price of 20s Yueqin was 2,680 yuan, and the price of 20s Shuangdiqiu was 2,100 yuan.

### The Gold Market Has Risen for Six Consecutive Days, Looking High After the Holiday

Yesterday, the spot gold market continued to rise by many points. The price repeatedly reached the 14,000 yuan mark and then fell back. People's hearts in all directions changed uncertainly. Nanjing merchants continued to enter the market, while gold firms limited their sales. The initial opening price was 50 yuan higher, at 13,900 yuan, with Tong Kangyong and a certain gold firm buying in, reaching 14,000 yuan. Silverware firms and another gold firm sold forcefully, limiting the selling price by 200 yuan, to 13,800 yuan. Hefayong, Fengyu, and Tong Kangyong Chengji again increased their efforts to enter the market. Outside customers, because they were bullish on the market after the Spring Festival holiday, rushed to buy in, which was raised by 260 yuan, rising to a high price of 14,060 yuan. Customers' appetites turned dull, and the selling intention of gold firms became stronger again. Many scattered profits sought to be taken, and the rise and fall wind stepped down 310 yuan, to 13,750 yuan. At noon, it rose again in a casual buying atmosphere. The final transaction price at noon was 13,950 yuan (followed by sellers), an increase of 100 yuan from the previous day. It has risen for six consecutive days, a total increase of 1,670 yuan, with a difference of 310 yuan on the same day. Silver ornaments in silverware stores are still listed at 1,450 yuan per tael (purchases are reduced by 150 yuan), silver bullion is listed at 14 yuan, and the black market rose again to 13 yuan. Silver dollars are 7.50 yuan each. Interest rates for money industry associations are lent for free, and discounting of bills is still flat.

### Gold Pound Rises 10 Yuan

Yesterday's foreign exchange market, British and American gold pounds each rose 10 yuan, the former being 350 yuan, the latter being 360 yuan. American dollar notes rose to 18.25 yuan. Small Hong Kong notes are needed at 3.10 yuan, and large notes are sold at 3.10 yuan. Military notes have retreated to 3.9923 yuan.

### Silver and Money Industry Will Change Business Hours Starting from the 19th

The temporary joint committee of members of the silver and money industry in this city resolved yesterday that, starting from February 19 (Thursday), the business hours of all banks and money houses will be changed to 10:00 AM to 4:00 PM, and Saturdays from 10:00 AM to 1:00 PM.

Rice shops in this city, following the usual practice for the Lunar New Year holiday, have decided to temporarily suspend the door-to-door sale of rice for three days, starting tomorrow (the 15th), and will resume business as usual on the 18th.

### Citrus (4)

— Gao Jiannong

There are so many types of citrus fruits that if you include all of them from China and abroad, there are really hundreds of varieties. Moreover, new varieties improved by artificial methods are constantly emerging. How can we record them all? As for the "Ju Lu" (Record of Citrus Fruits) written by Han Yanzhi of the Song Dynasty, he particularly praised the "Zhen Gan" (True Mandarin Orange) from the Nishan area of Wenzhou. He said: "The Zhen Gan is the most precious among all varieties. Its trunk and flowers are different from ordinary trees. The tree is often graceful, and the leaves are slender, dense, and provide a thick shade. The fragrance of the flowers is especially clear and distant. When the fruit sets, the fruits are round and upright, and the skin is like smooth wax. On the morning of the first frost, gardeners pick them and present them: the flavor illuminates the table, and when you break it open, a fragrant mist bursts forth, and northerners who do not know it will know it is a Zhen Gan at first sight! It is also called 'Ru Gan' (Milk Mandarin Orange), because its taste is like milk." He further used a special pen to record the mandarin oranges of Nishan and their advantages, saying: "Among the mandarin oranges in the four counties of Wenzhou, Nishan is the best. The land of Nishan is less than a mile, and the mandarin oranges produced there are not more than seven inches in circumference. The skin is thin, the taste is precious, the pulp does not stick to the segments, and there is no residue when eaten. Each fruit has only two seeds, and sometimes none at all..." Indeed, from the "fragrant mist bursts forth" and "no residue when eaten," it is so tempting that people drool! Later than the previous book, there is also the "Quan Fang Bei Zu" (Complete Record of All Fragrant Things) written by Chen Jingyi of the Song Dynasty, saying: "Han Yanzhi's 'Ju Lu' only knows that Ru Gan comes from Nishan, but does not know that it also comes from Huangyan, Tiantai: what comes from Nishan is certainly rare, but what comes from Huangyan is even more rare in the world!" The term "Huangyan Honey Mandarin Orange," which we people hear so much about now, also gets its footnote from here.

In the natural world, there is a strange phenomenon called "symbiosis," that is, two organisms - whether animals and animals, plants and plants, or animals and plants, etc., all have examples - mutually depend on each other for survival: the "mandarin orange tree" and "ants" are another excellent example. Moreover, it was our people who knew this phenomenon and first recorded it, and it can be traced back to the famous Ji Han at the end of the third century AD, which also shows that our country is not without natural scientists who carefully observe the world! Ji Han described this symbiotic phenomenon in "Nanfang Caomu Zhuang" (Records of Plants and Trees of the South), saying: "Mandarin oranges... the people of Jiaozhi store ants in mats and sell them in the market. Their nests are like thin cotton, and the branches and leaves inside are connected. The ants are in it, and they are sold with the nest. The ants are reddish-yellow and larger than ordinary ants. If there are no such ants on mandarin orange trees in the south, then all the fruits will be damaged by groups of borers, and none will be intact." Zhuang Jiyu of the Song Dynasty also said in his "Jilei Bian" (Chicken Rib Treatise): "There is little land for cultivation in Guangzhou, and the people mostly plant mandarin oranges to make a profit. Small insects often feed on the fruit, but if there are many ants on the tree, the insects cannot survive; therefore, families with orchards buy ants from others, and there are those who collect ants and sell them: they use pig and sheep veins to fill them with grease, open their mouths next to the ant nests, and wait for the ants to enter, then hold them and sell them as "mandarin orange ants."......"

Zhang Suzhou once had a poem saying: "Later, I want to write about three hundred fruits, and Dongting must wait for the forest to be covered with frost." Indeed, the good bridges produced in Dongting Mountain have been famous since ancient times: as evidenced by the "Shan Hai Jing" (Classic of Mountains and Seas) which already had the words "Mount Dongting has its trees, winter mandarin oranges and pomelos"; the "Historical Records" cited earlier can also be regarded as the same footnote; Guo Tuo's "Zhongshu Shu" (Book of Tree Planting) also said: "Although there are many mandarin oranges in the south, they are also afraid of frost and are not very productive. Only Dongting has a lot of frost, but there is no damage, and the mandarin oranges are the best, and the annual harvest is not depleted..." Pang Yuanying of the Song Dynasty explained in his "Wenchang Zalu" (Miscellaneous Records of Wenchang): "Dongting is surrounded by water on all sides, and the water vapor rises upwards, which can especially ward off frost, so Dongting mandarin oranges are the best; the annual harvest is not depleted, which is exactly what it means." As for other things like kumquats, fuju, sweet oranges, milk oranges, milk oranges, and sheep shit oranges, etc., which are scattered in the local chronicles of various provinces and counties, there are as many as the Ganges sands, and I can only wait for everyone to be free from blame.

When it comes to the spread of citrus fruits from our country to all directions, the first place to receive this gift is of course Jiaozhi, which is close to the water and since the Qin and Han dynasties has been a county - not a vassal state! - of our country. According to Ji Han's records: "Since Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty, Jiaozhi has had a 'Mandarin Orange Official' with a rank of two thousand stones, in charge of tribute to the imperial mandarin oranges." Leaving aside the oranges and pomelos produced in the woody soil of Jing Mountain, Lun Mountain, Copper Mountain, and Dongting Mountain - see the "Shan Hai Jing" - and leaving aside "Among the fruits of beauty, there are the oranges of Jiangpu" - see "Lü Shi Chunqiu" - but insisting on getting the products of the distant Jiaozhi: How profound, things are valued because they are far away! According to Ji Han's words: "In Wu Huangwu - the time of Sun Quan - Shi Xie, the governor of Jiaozhi, presented seventeen mandarin oranges with the same stem, considering it an auspicious omen, and the ministers congratulated him." There is also the "Nanzhong Ba Jun Zhi" (Records of the Eight Commanderies of Southern China) which says: "Jiaozhi especially produces good mandarin oranges, which are large and sweet, but cannot be eaten too much, causing diarrhea." It can also be seen the state of the native mandarin oranges of this Indochinese Peninsula. However, when Zhou Daguan of the Yuan Dynasty went to Zhenla as an envoy, he recorded its vegetation, saying: "Only pomegranates and sugar cane... are the same as in China; lychees and oranges, although the shape is the same, are sour..." - see "Zhenla Fengtu Ji" (Record of Customs of Zhenla) - contradicting the previously cited words "large and sweet," or perhaps he did not eat good oranges?

As for when the orange plant moved from Jiaozhi to India, it only cost "a foot's effort." It is a rather difficult question to answer. We know that the ancient Greeks and Romans were completely unaware of the name orange; especially the Greeks, who followed Alexander the Great to the Indus River in the latter half of the fourth century BC and were so clear about the things of India - such as the record of sugar cane - but they did not have even the slightest impression of the orange fruit. For example, the Greek general Nearone, who escorted Alexander all the way to India, had works passed down to the world: but people could not find even a trace of oranges in it. (To be continued)

Spring and Autumn

### A Closing Performance

— Jin Yi

According to the old rules of the theater, there is usually a closing performance at the end of the year. After the performance, the trunk is sealed, which brings good luck. The closing performance also usually has cross-dressing. Those who usually play Qingyi (virtuous female roles) extend their orchid fingers to play Huang Tianba; while Zhang Guilan, who is good at both civil and military Laosheng (old male roles), performs "Wax Temple," which is very lively and brings a burst of laughter. At the beginning of the resumption of publication of this magazine, we often forcibly pulled colleagues to play guest roles due to a lack of submissions. Therefore, during casual conversations, we proposed that on the day of the cessation of publication, colleagues would perform a closing performance, and donate all the manuscript fees to the reader scholarship fund of this newspaper, as if performing a charity show. Therefore, "Begonia" was ended early yesterday, leaving this place for colleagues to show their faces. Naturally, the program must be determined in advance, otherwise the Sheng (male roles), Dan (female roles), Jing (painted-face roles), and Chou (clown roles) cannot show their strengths. Therefore, today's titles of each article have been carefully considered. If readers savor them carefully, they will be able to understand the subtle relationship between the titles and the authors.

### Already Gotten Off the Car

— Buick

The so-called "gotten off the car" does not mean "just getting off the car." Having never been in politics, of course, it's not "getting off the car" to become an official. My "getting off the car" simply means getting out of an automobile.

In my childhood, I often admired Principal Xi Men's chartered car. When the driver strode quickly along Shangwen Road, the principal sat upright in the car with such an air of importance. When we encountered the principal on the road, we would certainly bow at a ninety-degree angle, otherwise, we would be reprimanded for disrespect in the ethics class. Eighteen years ago, I also had a chartered car, and I was secretly delighted, thinking I could rival the principal. Little did I know that after a year, the driver, Er'er, was really troublesome and difficult to deal with. Later, my family moved to Hangzhou and sent the chartered car to a transport company, which transported it without a trace. To this day, its whereabouts are unknown.

Because I was unwilling to mistreat myself and due to actual needs, nine years ago, I sat in a brand-new car using installment payments. At that time, gasoline was 58 cents per gallon, and the driver's salary was only thirty dollars a month. All calculated, the daily cost of the car was only three dollars. Sometimes, from Jiangwan to Zhenru, and then back to the city center from Zhenru, although the yellow dust billowed behind the car, I could come and go on time. Although I felt like I was enjoying myself excessively, I couldn't care less.

Indeed, as the General Motors salesman said, the car compartment was as big as a small parlor and like a private room on a train. If you first looked at the colorful car sample, it was really tempting. I got in the car like that and enjoyed more than two years of leisurely bliss. In the third year, the car often got sick, and it was sent to the hospital repeatedly for surgery, either grinding the valve or replacing the brakes, and my interest gradually diminished.

Probably in the spring of the year before last, the car was particularly old. When the speed reached thirty-five miles per hour, the front of the car shook constantly. If another surgery were performed, it would cost no less than three hundred taels of silver. Since I did not have such a large sum of money on hand at the time, I resolutely got out of the car and sold it to a young man who made a speculative fortune.

I have been out of the car for more than two years, and I have long been free of burdens. In this bitterly cold winter, I stand tall, marching forward proudly. Whether it is at dawn or dusk, I always move forward like this. Although the latest streamlined cars pass by me, I do not envy them. I walk on foot as a car, and I feel at ease.

### Year After Year Delivery

— Dong Zhi

The late winter has passed, and it is again the New Year. After the severe frost and snow, the plants have revived their shoots. All growing things are looking forward to the arrival of spring. Spring is so great, so kind, and so lovely! Willow branches, small birds, and butterflies among the flowers sing and praise the greatness of spring! Who knows the struggles of the plants in the frost and snow that allow the hundred flowers to bloom in spring?

"Year after year, wind and rain, cold and clear, sad and miserable," in this past year, I don't know how many couples have been separated, how many people have cried of hunger in a year of plenty! The prosperity of Shanghai has only made the rice merchants laugh while the common people cry all the way. Now, not only do the common people sigh for the lack of rice, but even the rice merchants are suffering the consequences. This phenomenon of wind and rain, sorrow, and pain is truly what was once a joke is now happening before our eyes!

Mencius said: "To labor their sinews and bones, to famish their bodies and skin." In these difficult times, everyone should prepare for even more difficult and arduous days to come. Always hold the desire to serve, and constantly seek peace in our hearts. Cut through thorns and brambles; there is a paradise in hardship, and only things achieved through hardship have value.

Farewell to Xin Si, welcome to Ren Wu, facing the arrival of spring, I hope people will "make their plans for the year in the spring," and serve diligently anew, today opening bright flowers, and in the future reaping good fruits!

### Storytelling with Stringed Instrument

— Ze Fu

Storytelling with stringed instrument (彈詞) is popular in the southern provinces, with Suzhou being the most developed. It is also called "shuoshu" (說書), storytelling. Its origins lie in the "zhugongdiao" (諸宮調) of the Song dynasty, and it also mainly involves playing and singing. It first appeared around the end of the Yuan dynasty. Yang Weizhen wrote a "Four Journeys" storytelling with stringed instrument, but unfortunately, it has been lost today, and its true appearance is no longer known. What is known today is the "Twenty-One Histories" storytelling with stringed instrument written by Yang Shen of the Ming dynasty, but its style is quite different from what is played and sung today. Storytelling with stringed instrument has been reformed since the Ming dynasty, mostly initially having only narration and singing, the narration being in prose, and the singing in verse, purely a third-person account. Later, it was considered too monotonous, so the words of the characters in the story were mixed in, and in addition to narration, there was also dialogue, like the roles of men, women, painted faces, and clowns in opera. Therefore, in the storytelling venues in Shanghai today, there are often "story operas" performed, which use storytelling with stringed instrument to create staged and costumed performances. As for the content of the storytelling with stringed instrument, it is nothing more than love stories of talented scholars and beautiful ladies, such as "Jade Dragonfly," "Pearl Pagoda," and "The Three Smiles." In addition, historical stories are used, such as the "Pacifying the Country" and "Stabilizing the Country" records, and the "Phoenix Mountain Trilogy," which writes about the rise and fall of the ancestors of the Zhao Song dynasty, reaching as many as six hundred and seventy-four chapters, truly a masterpiece in storytelling with stringed instrument. However, this type of storytelling with stringed instrument is not performed today, and is only used for readers' desk recreation.

### I Play "Wujiapo"

— Zhi Zhi

I wanted to tease Wang Baochuan (played by my colleague Ji Jun), but she always hid there digging vegetables. Perhaps she was very surprised by this soldier who came to deliver a message—Xue Pinggui, but in fact, she was only reluctantly responding. Twisting and pinching, seemingly smiling but not smiling, seemingly crying but not crying, she ultimately did not take off the mask of masculinity. I, who played Xue Pinggui, was in a high position, but I was teasing a vegetable-digging woman in front of a cold kiln, which was inevitably ridiculous; but the storytellers taught it this way, and the actors did it this way, so I had to imitate it this way. In fact, I had to be lifelike to be called a masterpiece.

"A horse left the Western Liang border" was not shouted loudly, and the people below might not have heard it. I thought it was bad. My "voice" was not clear today. I ran out with an old face, but I was still calm in my heart. I had the idea of playing, so I didn't need to be shy, so I became bolder. Regardless of whether the people below heard it or not, I sang mine, and I acted mine. Because of this, I got a cheap trick and, sure enough, the people below did not hear my problem.

Because this shy Wang Sanjie always hid aside and did not come close to me, I had to go forward to chat with her. Because my recitation was a little soft, perhaps this "fumbling" friend's mind wandered, and he forgot to start the drum. As a result, the huqin (胡琴) could not be pulled. In my heart, I was anxious, "August 15th..." I didn't know where to start singing, and I quickly gave him a "hint," and then the drum started, the huqin pulled the upside-down board, and I sang "August 15th, the moon is bright, Brother Xue ???..." Oh, I forgot the words below, what a disaster! In my wit, I followed the tune and mixed it up with nonsense. At that time, I secretly laughed at myself. After stepping down, I asked many friends if they had heard any problems? They all said no. It turned out that I took advantage of my low and hoarse voice. Only the two friends who rehearsed and rehearsed with me heard it. First, they were closer to me, and second, they were insiders. They were surprised that this sentence would unexpectedly "leak."

### Leisurely Moments in Busyness

— Zhi Cang

Being a modern person, of course, "having heard" is a blessing. However, my qualifications are not enough, so I can only meet the needs of a small capacity, and I am busy all day long.

It is embarrassing to say, my busyness never achieves anything. I am busy coping with life only. Of course, this is the minimum requirement, but it seems to add a lot of social life experience for "young people." Rice, coal, oil, and salt are naturally extremely vulgar and cannot be brought to the elegant hall, but when the elegant hall has already collapsed, for me, it is a serious social course. No one dares to ignore it, and no one dares not accept it—because this is the most realistic thing.

Because rice has reached one hundred sixty and two hundred sixty, coal briquettes have recently been panicked again and must be purchased in line; because oil has reached three yuan two jiao seven one jin, and even four yuan four in the black market... this makes me distraught and I have to be very busy, so that the monk has to strike the bell well for a day, otherwise, if he perfunctorily counts the bells, he will not be able to open the temple door. I want to live, and I hope to live decently, not in a drunken stupor, so I take reality quite seriously. There is more than just sorrow and resentment in my heart, that is just futile.

The meal has to be eaten, but after eating today, fortunately, the meal for tomorrow has also been found. In this second half of the day, my nerves can relax a little; I struggle to obtain food for the day after tomorrow for the sake of tomorrow, and now I may as well entertain myself in a limited way, this is the so-called "stealing half a day of leisure."

This half day is short, but it is also economical. I can read books like notes, or if I am more interested, I can go to a small cinema for sightseeing, but in the notes of the ancients, there are also often mentioned tragic stories of mankind; on the screen, there will also be the lean faces of Spanish refugees.

Now I understand Su Dongpo's request for guests to tell ghost stories, the mood of listening to it for what it is worth, although I am busy and vulgar.

### Feelings Upon Taking Up the Pen

— Wei Ming

The newspaper was suspended for six days. People who usually make a living by writing can at least rest for dozens of hours. For those who often hold a pen, isn't it the happiest and most satisfying thing to be able to spend a few days without needing to take up this "uneven" tool?

Of course, it's easier said than done. At the end of this old lunar year, even people with simple lives always have some matters, neither big nor small, to take care of. In the end, the first is..., the second is..., and the third is still.... Because people usually don't talk about the most mundane and boring household matters, but when they do, they can't do without this....

The standard of living is so high, and prices are like kites with broken strings. The higher you look, the more distant you feel. "What to do?" In this place and at this time, people scratching their heads and thinking hard are probably not just those who make a living by writing. This is unavoidable, undeniable, and it seems that there is no other good way but to brace oneself and make the greatest effort to cope with all difficulties.

In fact, at this time when there is nothing we can do, we feel that although rice is very expensive, our appetite is still very good. Our body is free from illness, and our spirit is quite healthy, which is very grateful. Let the past become a thing of the past. Although the future cannot be predicted, based on the psychology of the so-called foolish people having their own "fortune," we always hope that after this temporary pause in writing, prices will fall back down, so that everyone, like the sparrows in the Bible, will have their own food to maintain their lives.

Push aside all worries, and entrust what we cannot do to Heaven, and listen to fate. These are some small "feelings" when picking up the pen at this time.

### Strive at All Times

— Zhang

Ancients said: "If you don't work hard when you are young and strong, you will only grieve when you are old!" It seems that people should work hard when they are young and strong; Father said, "The plan for the year lies in spring," it seems that spring is the starting point for everyone's efforts; the story of Zuti (祖逖) dancing with chickens (聞鷄起舞) tells later generations that morning is a good time to work hard. These golden words give us profound prompts: we, at this time and in this place, with the triple perfection of "youth, spring, morning," should examine ourselves and see if we have done what we should do to strive in time.

But it is not enough to just strive in time. The ancients did not say it this way, but their original intention was definitely not to teach people to strive in time and not to strive at all times. Many people have misunderstood this meaning, resulting in starting well but not finishing. Spring is indeed reluctantly used as the starting point, but in the hot summer, it is perfectly acceptable to sleep, and there is no doubt about it. Not to mention the clear and refreshing autumn, suitable for outings, and the severe winter, which should only be used to occupy the bed.

You can learn until you are old, but you will never learn everything. This is a famous saying that every scholar regards as a guiding principle. Isn't striving the same? Striving has no end, just as success has no limit. If you think you have worked hard enough and can rest, or if you think your efforts have been successful and you no longer need to work hard, then this indicates that you have failed. Whether for learning or career, one should view it in this way. Only those who strive forever, regardless of their gains, will ultimately be the most successful. On this evening of closing the book, I wish the readers to strive at all times and encourage myself with this.
