### Fierce Battles at Kharkiv for Two Weeks Have Not Yet Reached a Decisive Stage, Main Force Struggles Move to the Izyum Area, German Forces are Counterattacking, the Situation is Confused

Havas Agency dispatch from somewhere on the Soviet border, dated 24th: The Battle of Kharkiv has lasted for two weeks, but according to the latest news, the battle has not yet reached a decisive stage. Both Germany and the Soviet Union claim victory. According to the German side, the Red Army has adopted a defensive posture everywhere, and the Battle of Kharkiv has entered "the second stage." The so-called second stage is said to be beneficial to the German army. German war reports claim that after the German counterattack, a large number of Red Army troops south of Kharkiv have been surrounded by the German army. The Soviet side claims that the Red Army's offensive is still progressing, but Axis forces are encircling the Red Army in the Losovaya and Izyum areas. The fighting in the northeastern Kharkiv area has been quiet for five days, but is now becoming fierce again. Last night, the Red Army attacked the Lipetsk-Kharkiv line and, after a fierce battle, captured Lipetsk. According to military sources, the Red Army has received reinforcements and is strong enough to launch an offensive. The Red Army General Staff hopes that the offensive in northeastern Kharkiv can relieve the pressure on the German forces in the Izyum area. The German forces led by General Bock have a large number of personnel and are sufficient to cope with any Red Army offensive. Moreover, the German army has had ample time to build strong defenses. It is undeniable that the German air force has an absolute advantage, which has greatly affected General Timoshenko, because no matter from which direction an offensive is launched to relieve the siege of northeastern Kharkiv, it is necessary to take into account the advantage of the German air force. The fighting in the Izyum area is still fierce, which is of great importance, not only determining the fate of the Battle of Kharkiv, but also the success or failure of the Red Army's offensive on the southern route depends on this. According to German sources, no less than 40,000 Red Army troops are trapped in the Izyum pocket. Last night, the Red Army repeatedly attempted to break through the encirclement and attack the Slavyansk line, which is probably one of the weakest points in the German defenses. It is reported that some points have been broken through, but they were met with resolute resistance from the German army. After a fierce battle, the northern side of the pocket was finally broken. The Red Army is only eight miles away from the city of Novosebkov. The battles on other fronts are also becoming increasingly fierce, and there are various signs that a large-scale war will intensify and spread to various theaters.

Reuters dispatch from London, dated 25th: Tonight, official war reports from Moscow stated that the Red Army, advancing towards Kharkiv, has resumed its offensive after consolidating its positions occupied in Benkuti. According to the Soviet midday communique, "The Soviet forces in several areas of the Kharkiv front have consolidated their positions and are now engaged in offensive operations. The Soviet forces in the Izyum and Barvenkovo areas continue to fight fiercely with German tanks and infantry. There were no major events in other areas of the front." London sources believe that the main force struggle between the forces led by Soviet General Timoshenko and German General Bock has shifted from the Kharkiv area to the Izyum front, where the German army is currently counterattacking, and the situation is quite chaotic. A report in today's "Krasnaya Flot" newspaper of the Soviet Navy described an encounter between a Soviet light warship and German tanks. Before the end of the Battle of Kerch, the Soviet warship was patrolling near the coast, providing artillery support, when it was suddenly attacked by German tanks and damaged. However, the gunners continued to bombard, blocking the tanks, until all the crew members were taken away by a steamer.

Alliance Agency dispatch from Lisbon, dated 24th: According to Berlin sources, German Führer Hitler convened an emergency special meeting of generals at the front line headquarters on the 24th. After the meeting, he also had important discussions with Marshal Göring, and then returned to Berlin. At a time when the German and Soviet armies on the Eastern Front are engaged in fierce battles, Hitler's discussions with the generals are quite noteworthy.

Hitler Holds Meeting with Generals at the Front Line

Haitong Agency dispatch from the German Führer's Headquarters, dated 25th: This afternoon, German war reports stated that most of the three Soviet divisions fighting in Kharkiv were heavily besieged, and the elite troops of the armored forces were also trapped. Although the enemy repeatedly attempted to break through, they failed and suffered heavy losses. Our army, fighting in the central sector, captured 30 locations. Enemy forces southeast of Lake Ilmen launched several attacks, all of which were repulsed. In the Lapland area, German and Finnish allied forces fought hard for several weeks, and enemy forces were annihilated, reaching several divisions. The 19th Motorized Bicycle Team of our army, regardless of the difficult terrain, broke into the heavily defended, fortress-strewn ladder formation. In the Gulf of Kandalaksha area, German dive bomber groups destroyed an important railway bridge, which is a key point for the passage of the Murmansk Railway.

### Large-Scale War is About to Begin, German and Soviet Forces Each Have Three Hundred Divisions

Alliance Agency dispatch from Lisbon, dated 23rd: According to Angola Broadcasting, the German army's large-scale war preparations will be completed within ten days, and a major operation will begin. Currently, 72,000 to 82,000 Hungarian troops have arrived on the Eastern Front. Romania and Italy have also sent large forces. In addition, Germany has assembled 300 divisions on the Eastern Front. The Soviet Union has also assembled 300 divisions on the Kharkiv and Moscow lines, especially more on the Moscow front.

Havas Agency dispatch from Budapest, dated 24th: The Chairman of the Hungarian War Veterans Association, Reviczky, stated in a speech in Kolozsvár today, "We have always believed that an anti-communist war will sooner or later occur. Only the arrogant believe that the Soviet Union can allow Hungary to exist. Therefore, our country is now engaged in a holy war. At this time, our countrymen should no longer engage in endless discussions, causing disputes within the country, or disputes with neighboring countries. This kind of action is harmful to Europe and has no benefit."

Havas Agency dispatch from Madrid, dated 24th: The Spanish volunteer army "Blue Division," stationed on the Eastern Front, will have 1,300 members whose term is expiring.

Haitong Agency dispatch from Berlin, dated 25th: Today, the German High Command announced that the German army in the Kharkiv operation is progressing according to plan. Most of the three Soviet divisions have been trapped south of Kharkiv. Recent Soviet war reports also admitted that the Germans had broken into the Soviet positions in Kharkiv. There is fierce fighting in the area from Izyum to Barvenkovo. The German army in the central and northern sections of Eastern Europe has achieved victories in both offense and defense. A German commando suddenly appeared northeast of Voronezh, broke into the Soviet positions at night, occupied several locations, and then attacked a village heavily defended by Soviet elite troops, making continuous progress. The Soviet troops abandoned the defended houses, fled in cars, and left behind a large amount of military equipment and supplies, which were completely destroyed by the German army. Then, the commando returned to the German positions with some prisoners. In addition to assisting the army in combat, German aircraft flew low to disperse enemy tank columns and supply trains. Twenty enemy aircraft were shot down by German fighter planes.

Havas Agency dispatch from Berlin, dated 24th: A German military spokesman stated that the German High Command will soon release information on the losses of the Soviet army on the Kharkiv front, which can prove the large number of troops used by the Soviet Union and the heavy losses. Therefore, it is not difficult to speculate on the collapse of the war situation. As for the recent situation in Kharkiv, no news has been received here. German radio stations only released detailed information on the war in the past few days, saying that the development of the war is beneficial to the German army. The German army in the Donets River basin has also increased its artillery fire, and the Soviet army has suffered increasing losses. At one location on the line, 45 Soviet tanks were destroyed yesterday. In addition, the German air force was very successful in bombing enemy tank columns and destroyed three bridgeheads on the Donets River.

Alliance Agency dispatch from Kuibyshev, dated 24th: The Soviet Information Bureau announced last night the war situation in the Kharkiv area in recent days, which mentioned that the German army had begun an offensive, briefly stating that on the 23rd, the Soviet army on the Kharkiv-Izyum front was attacked by German tanks and infantry, and the situation in various places was still in a stalemate. On the same day, the German army in the Izyum area launched an even more fierce major offensive, and the Soviet army is currently resisting vigorously.

### A Comparison of German and French Strength at the Beginning of the War in Europe

Vichy, 25th (Haitong News Agency) - The weakness of the French military strength, which was discussed in the Lyon trial, has now been announced by French magazines based on the prosecutor's indictment. It is said that at the beginning of France's entry into the war, it had only 111 divisions, while Germany had 170 divisions on the Western Front. In May 1940, the French army's strength increased to 115 divisions, but the German army increased to 180 divisions. In January 1940, the French armory had only 5,000 old-fashioned rifles. By April of the same year, it was unable to manufacture automatic pistols, new machine guns, trench mortars, and hand grenades. On the day of the French mobilization, there were only 2,108 tanks, while the German army had 4,200 tanks. By May 1940, the French army's tanks increased to 3,160, but the German army's tanks increased to 8,000. At that time, France had only one anti-aircraft gun that could shoot down aircraft below 1,500 meters. There was also only one anti-aircraft gun with a caliber of 75 cm that could shoot down aircraft between 1,500 meters and 5,000 meters. There were no 99 cm anti-aircraft guns at all. From this, it can be seen that France had no weapons to deal with aircraft above 5,000 meters. The French army needed to consume 1 million 75 cm shells per day in Verdun, but on the day of the French army's mobilization, there were only 12 million shells. There were also no new-style large-caliber cannons or heavy mines. All that existed could be destroyed by infantry gunfire. The equipment of other military supplies was also incomplete. On September 1, 1939, France had only 1,410 aircraft, most of which were old-fashioned. By May 10, 1940, the number of French aircraft had increased to 1,730, but only 1,310 of them were new-style aircraft. In contrast, on September 1, 1939, Germany had 10,000 new-style aircraft, and by May 10, 1940, it had increased to 15,700. Italy also had 2,500 aircraft. From this, it can be seen one aspect of the weakness of the French military strength.

### The Soviet Union's Petroleum

The Soviet Union is now the world's second-largest oil-producing country, second only to the United States, the world's largest oil-producing country. Its oil production in 1938 was 202.3 million barrels, in 1939 it was 216.5 million barrels, and in 1940 it was 225 million barrels. One barrel equals 45 gallons, and assuming 7 barrels equals one metric ton, then the Soviet Union's production in the most recent year was 30 million metric tons. Although this cannot catch up with the United States, the world's largest oil-producing country, which produces 180 million metric tons per year, accounting for about 61 percent of the world's total production, it is enough to rank first among other countries.

However, the Soviet Union's status as the world's second-largest oil producer is only a recent development. From the end of the 19th century to the beginning of the 20th century, it has always competed with the advanced United States for oil hegemony. Although it was only for a few years, around the turn of the century, the Soviet Union once dominated the world's oil production. Since the beginning of this century, due to the rapid development of the American oil industry, a great difference has occurred in the output of both sides. Even so, the Soviet Union has always occupied the second position. Its descent below second place was limited to the few years when the revolution occurred in the country and the oil industry was in a state of stagnation.

The Center of Oil Production

So, where is this large amount of oil produced? Currently, the oil fields that produce oil within the Soviet Union can be roughly divided into the following areas: the Caucasus region, the Ural region, Central Asia, and the Far East. Among them, until recently, the Caucasus region produced more than 90 percent of the oil produced within the Soviet Union. Recently, due to the increase in oil production in other regions, the percentage has decreased slightly compared to before, but it still maintains a record of about 88 percent, and it is still the center of the Soviet oil industry.

If we set up the oil fields in the Caucasus region, we can further subdivide them into the following three oil fields: the Baku oil field, the Grozny oil field, and the Maikop oil field.

Just as the center of the Soviet oil industry is the Caucasus, the center of the Caucasus oil industry is the Baku oil field. In fact, the Soviet oil industry started with the Baku oil field. At the beginning of this century, the output of the Baku oil field accounted for 100% to 97% of the total output. Later, as new oil fields were discovered one after another, its proportion gradually decreased, but its output has always increased, and it still maintains the status of the central oil field of the Soviet Union today.

The Oil Fields of the Caucasus

In the northwest corner of the Asian continent, near the border with Europe, lies the Black Sea, the Caspian Sea, and the Sea of Azov, forming a complex terrain. Between the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea lies a vast isthmus-shaped land, connecting the borders of Asia and Europe. This isthmus-shaped part is the Caucasus region. In the center of this area, a large mountain range stretches across, which is the famous Caucasus Mountains, extending from northwest to southeast for 750 miles.

The surrounding rolling hills of the Caucasus Mountains have been famous since ancient times for their rich oil springs and asphalt deposits. One part of the hills in the eastern part of this mountain range protrudes into the Caspian Sea, forming a small island called Apsheron. This island has many oil springs and asphalt deposits. And to the south of this peninsula is a small port called Baku. Because this is actually the center of the peninsula's oil business, the peninsula's oil fields have been collectively called the Baku oil field.

The Baku oil field was stimulated by the rise of the American oil industry and began to rise in 1875. The naturally rich oil layers allowed it to quickly surpass the advanced United States.

Following the Baku oil field, the Grozny and Maikop oil fields were successively discovered on the northern foothills of the Caucasus Mountains. Grozny's oil production reached one million barrels in 1895 and ten million barrels in 1914. As for the Maikop oil field, it did not reach one million barrels until 1928. It can be seen that these two oil fields only began to occupy an important position in the Caucasus in the last ten years.

The Grozny oil field is located in the east of the northern foothills of the mountain range, close to the Caspian Sea, only 90 miles from the coast. Conversely, Maikop is in the west, 130 miles from the Sea of Azov. The distance between the two oil fields is approximately 300 miles.

The Mission of the Petroleum Industry

The Soviet Union's oil production surged to 80 million barrels in 1901. However, not only was there no increase after that, but it was gradually declining. On the one hand, this was due to the depletion of the Baku oil field, and on the other hand, it was due to the repeated strikes by oil workers. Originally, the sharp increase in oil production caused the oil price to fall, and the fall in the oil price indirectly led to the reduction of wages. Workers demanded higher wages and often carried out strikes as a threat, which resulted in the further decline of the already shrinking Baku oil industry.

However, a major event that required the liquidation of everything in the past occurred in 1918, that is, the invasion of the Baku area by the Red Army. From March 1918 to May 1920, the Baku oil field was completely turned into a bloody battlefield, and there was no room for oil production at all. Therefore, the oil production in that year also dropped sharply to 25 million barrels.

On May 28, 1920, the Soviet government nationalized all oil industries in the area. At that time, the number of factories confiscated reached 309, and the total capital was 954.48 million rubles.

Since being nationalized, the speed of development of the Soviet oil industry has been amazing. Oil production began to increase year by year. Of course, its main force was the oil fields in the Caucasus region, with Baku as the center. If we express the increased production in numbers, it would be roughly like this: The production of only 25 million barrels in 1920 doubled to 52 million barrels in 1925, surged to 125 million barrels in 1920, and by 1933 it had become seven or eight times the 182 million barrels when it began to be state-owned. Among them, during the five years from 1928 to 1932, according to the First Five-Year Plan, it increased from 85 million barrels in 1928 to 154 million barrels in 1932, an average annual increase of 14 million barrels. The Second Five-Year Plan began in 1933, and by 1927 it had increased to 195 million barrels, an average annual increase of 8 million barrels. As for the subsequent production, it has been described in detail at the beginning of this article, so there is no need to repeat it here.

Newly Discovered Oil Fields

Above, we have established that the Soviet government has successively implemented five-year plans to increase oil production, and at the same time, it has discovered many new oil fields. This is naturally quite beneficial to increasing the total national output, but there is only one place that shows a rapid development. That is the new oil field discovered in the Ural region.

The Ural region belongs to the Paleozoic strata, and no one thought that there would be any oil here. However, in 1928, when exploring for potassium mines, the drill bit actually touched the source of petroleum. As a result of efforts to develop it, 2.9 million barrels were extracted in 1935, and 13.6 million barrels could be extracted in 1939.

The oil fields in the Central Asian region can be divided into: The Emba oil field and several other oil fields on the eastern coast of the Caspian Sea, The Fergana oil field in Turkestan

As for the Soviet Union's oil industry in the Far East, it refers to the oil field in the northern part of Sakhalin Island

The oil production in the Central Asian and Far Eastern oil fields accounted for 2.8% of the total Soviet oil production in 1936, increased to 3.9% in 1937, and surged to 6.4% in 1938.

Among them, the oil production on Sakhalin Island is estimated to be more than 4 million barrels, according to reliable estimates. In addition, near Lake Baikal, the Soviet authorities have been engaged in test drilling for oil, and according to recent literature, it seems that a small amount of oil has been extracted.

The above is a general overview of the Soviet Union's oil resources. In short, the center is still the Baku oil field, which accounts for about 90% of the domestic production and produces 22 million metric tons per year. This oil field and the important port of Batumi on the Black Sea are connected by a 560-mile railway and several oil pipelines. Its passage is on the lowlands south of the Caucasus Mountains, with very few natural barriers that can be relied upon for defense. Batumi is the export point of Baku oil, and there is a large-scale oil refinery here. If the Soviet Union were to lose control of the Black Sea, Baku would become a tooth without lips.

Baku, the city in the Soviet oil-producing area, has been modernized. The picture shows the scene of Gubanov Street.

### Yesterday Continued to Allocate Foreign Rice, Selling Price Changed Again, Retail Price 7 Yuan and 2 Jiao Per Half Liter, Deadline for Rice Shop Reopening Applications Has Passed

Yesterday, the Shanghai Municipal Council's Rice and Grain Office continued to allocate foreign rice to various rice shops, and the selling price per bag in legal tender increased again. The retail price of foreign rice sold by various rice shops today has changed to 7 yuan and 2 jiao per half liter. The details are noted below:

The Price of Whole Bags of Council Rice Has Also Increased

Yesterday, rice shops in the two concessions purchased rice from the Shanghai Municipal Council's Rice and Grain Management Office, and the price per bag in legal tender increased to 504 yuan. The rice allocated yesterday can be sold by the rice shops after being picked up from the warehouse on Thursday. The total number is more than 10,000 bags. Designated rice outlets are: Mitsubishi Warehouse on North Yangtzepoo Road, Jardine Matheson Warehouse on the Bund in the French Concession, and Zhejiang Yuye Warehouse on North Soochow Road.

Deadline for Applications from Closed Rice Shops

The Shanghai Municipal Council's Rice and Grain Management Office announced that closed rice shops (excluding those whose licenses were revoked for violating regulations) could apply in writing to reopen. The application deadline has now passed. More than 400 closed rice shops have submitted applications. The Council is currently reviewing them. However, the rice shop industry hopes that all applications will be approved. According to general speculation, the Council's notice states that "submitting an application to the Council does not mean that reopening is permitted." Therefore, it is feared that the overall reopening is hopeless.

Foreign Rice in All Warehouses Has Been Sold Out

It is also learned that the foreign rice in the Shanghai & Whampoa Wharf warehouse in Yangtzepoo has been sold out. As for the foreign rice stored in warehouses north and south of the Soochow Creek, Chengdu Road, Xiamen Road, Baker Road, and the Bund in the French Concession before December 8 of last year, the Council has continuously allocated and sold them to various rice shops. The rice currently being sold is all coarse rice that has recently arrived, and there should be no shortage.

### Warehouse in Yangtzepoo Carelessly Caught Fire the Night Before Last

According to the English Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury, a warehouse at 1196 Yangtzepoo Road carelessly caught fire at 11:30 PM last night (the 24th). The fire was very fierce and was not extinguished until dawn today (the 25th). A large amount of waste cotton was burned, but no one was injured. It is heard that the warehouse has two floors, and only the upper floor was used to store waste cotton. The fire started on the upper floor. Because waste cotton is very flammable, the burning was very intense. The firelight could be seen for miles. As a result, only the shells of the upper floor and roof of the warehouse remain. However, the lower floor was not severely damaged. The fire brigade rushed to the scene to put out the fire. Because the windows of the warehouse were equipped with iron bars, the work was greatly hindered. Fortunately, the fire chief of the Yangtzepoo Fire Brigade, General Garnell, and the acting director of the Fire Prevention Association, Hua Jin, arrived at the scene to direct the operation, which prevented the flames from spreading to the lower floor of the warehouse and neighboring houses. The losses from this fire cannot be estimated, but it is believed to be quite large, as the warehouse occupies an area of about 1,800 square feet.

### House Sublet Licenses to Be Discontinued Soon; Prosecution for Failure to Obtain License by Deadline; Total Number Issued Reaches 40,000

The Shanghai Municipal Council's issuance of house sublet licenses to second landlords, which began on the first day of last month and continued until yesterday, has reached a total of only 41,045. Very few people have been collecting them recently. Yesterday, only one license was issued in the Central District, seven in the Western District, two in the Northern District, and three in the Eastern District. The deadline for obtaining these licenses was originally the end of last month. However, due to the possibility that some second landlords were not fully aware of the consequences, the deadline was extended by fifteen days from May 1st. However, a late fee of five yuan was required for supplementary collection during this period. The deadline was then extended again for fifteen days until the end of this month. With the deadline approaching, it is said that prosecution will be initiated and penalties imposed if licenses are not obtained by the deadline.

### Shanghai-Ningbo Shipping Line: Four Ships Operating; Haitong and Wanji Sail to Ningbo One After Another

The Shanghai-Ningbo shipping route remains as congested as ever lately. Every time a ship sails to Ningbo, all cabin space is sold out, leaving many people disappointed. The Haitong of the Zhejiang Eastern Shipping Company and the Wanji of the Shanghai-Ningbo Shipping Company generally sail to Ningbo every four or five days, barring special circumstances. These two ships departed for Ningbo on the previous and yesterday, respectively. According to the East Asia Maritime Transport Society's company and ticket office, the scheduled sailing date for the Changshan is set for the 27th of this month, and the Hualin will also depart on the same day. It is reported that the Changshan will carry thirty coffins of fellow villagers to be buried in their hometown this time.

According to other sources, after changing ownership, the German ship Haifulen was renamed Wansheng and underwent repairs in the dock. The newspaper has previously reported that she would resume service on schedule. Now, according to maritime industry sources, the ship will soon set sail, operating mainly to ports north of the Yangtze River. Furthermore, the Gaodeng, formerly owned by the German company Rudolf Lindemann, has been renamed Dafeng after becoming a Chinese enterprise and began sailing to Hupu on the 21st, with a sailing every two days.

### The Danger Period for Smallpox Has Not Passed; Remarks by Health Commissioner Jordan

The English-language Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury reports that Public Health Commissioner Jordan stated this morning (the 25th) in an interview that it would be overly optimistic and premature to claim that smallpox is no longer prevalent this year due to the widespread vaccination campaign. Smallpox in the city sometimes occurs in May, but not necessarily. The most dangerous period is in June, so we cannot be complacent until August has passed. Currently, health authorities are still vigilant against the spread of smallpox this year. Any epidemic either originates locally or is transmitted from elsewhere. If it originates locally, it remains dormant in the area and can erupt at any time. There is much debate about which category smallpox in Shanghai falls into. He personally believes it should be classified as imported, so the best way to prevent smallpox is to stop large numbers of people from coming to Shanghai. In addition, there are various preventive measures, such as vaccination and preventing unclean water sources.

### Recent News from Sida Hardware Factory

Sida Factory's "Wheel" brand zippers feature a novel design that is lightweight, flexible, and strong. The zippers open and close smoothly and are durable. The teeth are aligned and do not break or come apart. The fabric tapes are available in many colors and are beautiful and pleasing to the eye. Major cotton mills, shirt factories, leather goods factories, and fashion companies are placing large orders with the factory.

### Struggling for Survival (Part Two): The Jewish Street Market; Their Unique Characteristics: Resolution, Perseverance, Resourcefulness, and Risk-Taking

Besides these salesmen who make a living from commissions, one often sees Jewish vendors in the streets, hawking their wares loudly. They mainly sell soap, shoelaces, woolen fabrics, and other light daily necessities. They speak broken Chinese, which looks quite funny, but their courage to survive is praiseworthy.

Buying and Selling, Earning Commissions

Every morning, many Jews gather near the intersection of Sichuan Road and Nanjing Road, near the Central Arcade. Most of them are brokers, choosing this convenient transportation area as their meeting place. Almost everyone carries a briefcase and a small notebook, writing this and that. This is the central area for small money changers. They keenly inquire about market conditions and engage in speculative trading. Many people stand at street corners, counting large stacks of banknotes. US dollars, Japanese military notes, reserve notes, and legal tender change hands repeatedly as they buy and sell. They are also brokers for miscellaneous items such as woolen fabrics, medicines, and cigarettes. Their customers are mostly people within their own circle, and they earn commissions by brokering deals.

Around nine or ten o'clock, these Jewish merchants come out of Hongkou in groups, crossing the Sichuan Road Bridge and arriving at this temporary market. Everyone is dressed smartly, exuding a gentlemanly air. They stand in groups along the sidewalks. Some are talking loudly, some are whispering in each other's ears, some are pacing back and forth alone, and some are quietly calculating accounts in a corner. The two nearby coffee shops are entirely their world. The waitresses diligently serve them, hoping that these stingy people will do well in business and be generous enough to give more than the usual amount of money.

Men and Women Alike, Striving for Survival

From the Central Arcade to the Bund on Beijing Road. Every noon, a large number of Jewish women pour into the Bund Park. Their work is more arduous than others. They go to the park not to escape the hustle and bustle of the city, but simply to find a clean place to eat the bread and other things they brought, as a simple lunch. Some sit on benches, while others lie lazily on the carpet-like grass. Like the men, they are also skilled salespeople, greeting people with charming smiles in the park, hoping they will buy their goods. They have no ideals of a happy family, nor do they want to indulge in romantic dreams. They temporarily abandon the beautiful values of life and struggle in this unfamiliar city to gain a foothold, help their husbands or fathers and brothers, and strive for the material necessities of life.

### The Gold Rush

— Ha Tai

The grand clock in the racecourse is pointing to nine o'clock. The main roads in the city center have awakened from their sleep. Shop assistants yawn as they pull up the iron gates. Piles of "animals" (!), who have been lodging in front of the shops, begin to stir and crawl away in all directions, wrapped in broken mats or tattered bags. From west to east, the long serpent-like lines of trams, chartered rickshaws, and bicycles endlessly disgorge all sorts of modern men and women -- of course, there are also bald, burly men, "half-dead" skinny men, and even those in long robes and gowns or well-dressed "Old Men." Needless to say, these respectable ladies are going to the office, but at least one-third of their so-called "offices" are places called "Silver Houses" or "Yarn Houses," in my opinion.

The ×× Yarn House has only been open for a few days. Piles of half-withered flower baskets still stand in front of the door; the strong smell of fresh paint shoots straight into people's nostrils. At this time, the small rectangular room is already "packed." Some are sitting around a large dining table drinking tea or smoking; some are pacing back and forth; some are sitting alone in a corner reading tabloids; and some are talking very enthusiastically about the market situation, such as "the factory order has been returned" and "today you can turn long." In short, everyone is calmly waiting for the "opening."

In the right corner of the room is a long counter, on which are placed at least a dozen telephone sets of different sizes and heights. Behind the counter hangs a huge blackboard marked with squares, and six or seven male and female staff members sit inside, chatting idly.

Nine thirty.

Suddenly, a chubby, bald-headed middle-aged man stood up in front of the counter and shouted loudly into a regular telephone handset:

"Hello, hello! What's the opening price of Double Horse?"

In an instant, everyone's eyes were focused on him.

"Ah, the opening price is 6,900 yuan!" The man shouted loudly, and a young apprentice-looking man wrote it down on the blackboard.

"Hello, 900—950; 950—7,000; 7,050—100!" A series of hoarse shouts, pinching the handset in his left hand and bending his fingers in his right hand, gesticulating vigorously, the rolled-up section of the snow-white shirt cuffs looked particularly beautiful and moving because of the hand movements.

The whole place was in an uproar. "Buy ten packs at 050!" "Sell three packs!" "Liji enters three packs!" The sounds were all mixed together. Two young girls were writing down accounts non-stop, sweat streaming down their foreheads.

"Now someone is selling at 050 yuan—980—7,000; 70—80; 60—70;... 800—820—"

Another burst of commotion, another burst of "sell ten packs," "sell five packs" sounds. At this time, I was wandering around the room with my newly opened account slip, not knowing what to do.

"It looks like the foundation is weakening, I think you can short." A man in a suit said to his companion.

Since I had no idea, I listened to his advice and quietly ran to the front of the counter and did a short trade of one package.

Sure enough, it dropped from 820 to 500 in one go. I was secretly delighted and calculated that I had already earned about 300 yuan.

In the middle was a period of fluctuating "circling," and the voice of the fat man on the phone became a little hoarse, with saliva all over his lips.

"Now, there are rumors in the market that the factory order has been returned. 7,100—150; 150—200; 200—250... 9,000—9,100! I want 9,000 yuan!" The frantic shouting was simply a little impassioned.

Ah: 9,100 yuan! I calculated in my stomach that 9,100 yuan minus 6,820 yuan equals 2,280 yuan, and the 500 yuan margin is over! I dragged my heavy feet out of the ×× Yarn House weakly.

The next morning, the postman delivered a registered letter:

"Mr. Ha Tai:

Your account sold a package of Bianma factory orders valued at 6,820 yuan, but the opening price this morning reached 9,500 yuan. Our company has settled it on your behalf according to the regulations. After deducting the margin of 500 yuan, you still owe 2,180 yuan. Please settle it as soon as possible!

××

Yarn House"

Oh dear! The 500 yuan margin was still obtained by selling my wife's only jewelry. How can I repay this huge sum?

### "Nao Wei" Nerve-Specific Tonic Invented by Dr. Weidan

Dr. Weidan, an expert in neuropathology, has recently invented a special agent that specializes in the treatment of all nervous system diseases and disorders.

The main raw materials used in the production of "Nao Wei" are lecithin contained in nerve cells and the original substance containing iron essence. Therefore, it can have a special effect on the sympathetic nervous system and produce a therapeutic response to diseases, with the same effect as Dr. Weidan's contact nasal membrane therapy. However, Dr. Weidan does not mean that "Nao Wei" can replace his new therapy. However, this medicine is for patients who live far away, cannot come to see a doctor in person, or cannot receive contact nasal membrane therapy often due to work reasons.

"Nao Wei" can treat all nervous system disorders and symptoms caused by weakened blood circulation. "Nao Wei" is most effective for those suffering from neurasthenia. Patients with nerve sensitivity often feel depressed for no reason and often feel pessimistic and suffer. After taking "Nao Wei," they can immediately regain confidence and banish sad thoughts from their minds. If you lose weight and your body is weak, taking it will also have miraculous effects.

The "Nao Wei" invented by Dr. Weidan can strengthen various organs, so it can also treat chronic bronchial and lung cough diseases and asthma. As for patients who have lost their reproductive capacity, they can also restore their youth. This is because the excitement of youth depends on the secretion of glands and the health of the sympathetic nervous system and the activation of its nerve potential. If you initially find that you have impotence and other diseases, taking "Nao Wei" immediately can restore your original health, because this medicine contains a large amount of vitality to enhance the organs and supplement the deficiency of glands. All those who use "Nao Wei" feel that it has the effect of returning to youth.

"Nao Wei" also has the effect of calming nerves and can deeply treat insomnia and restore sleep.

"Nao Wei" is also very effective for children with delayed physical and mental development, addiction to laziness, or nerve seizures.

"Nao Wei" has a great ability to promote blood circulation, so it can immediately treat irregular menstruation and menstrual pain.

"Nao Wei" is made into pills. Take one pill before three meals a day. Children aged 10 to 17 should take half.

"Nao Wei" is sold in the following major pharmacies and Weidan Chemical Pharmaceutical Factory (Room 101, No. 868 Jing'an Temple Road, telephone 36195). The main distributors are listed below:

Bai Bu Yanghang, 17 Guangdong Road

Watson's Pharmacy, 71 Nanjing Road

Watson's Pharmacy, 275 Jing'an Temple Road

Watson's Pharmacy, 965 Xiafei Road

### Dancer Returns Home Late at Night with a Client; Second Landlord Forces Eviction; Client Injured in Assault for Objecting; Lawsuit Filed and Summons Issued

Zhu Aiyue, a dancer at Central Dance Hall, resides in the Jusheng Hotel on the third floor of Lane 405, Junction of Avenue Edward VII and Rue de la Gendarmerie. On the 26th of last month, at midnight, Zhu returned home with a dance client, Wang Dafang (resident of 98 Route Doumer), for a chat. Suddenly, Zhang Mingzheng, the 20-year-old Wuxi owner of the Jusheng Hotel, arrived and demanded that Zhu move out, causing an argument between the two parties. Wang Dafang, seeing this,

Spoke out for Fairness

Argued that the second landlord should not force a tenant to move out late at night and that such unreasonable oppression was inappropriate. Zhang then vented his anger on Wang and immediately went downstairs with his younger brother, Zhang Mingde, and an employee, Qin Rengen, rushing into Zhu's room, grabbing and beating Wang, causing injuries to Wang's chest and other areas. The police brought both parties into the police station. Wang stated the details of the assault, while Zhang Mingzheng claimed that Zhu often brought male clients

To Stay Overnight

And talked and laughed loudly late at night, which not only disturbed the sleep of other tenants, but also, with the police recently investigating household registrations, the issue of dancers bringing guests home was a matter of concern for the second landlord. Therefore, he negotiated with her, but there was no act of violence. The police chief ordered them to leave. Wang Dafang, feeling unwilling to be beaten for no reason, has specially commissioned a lawyer to file a lawsuit against Zhang Mingzheng and his brother on charges of assault. A summons will be issued soon.

### Chauffeur Conspires with Gang to Steal Vehicles; Ring Leader Yu Jinfu Arrested

Since the police authorities, in order to save gasoline, completely suspended the use of privately owned vehicles of non-essential service personnel in the Public Concession, the French Concession, and the Chinese areas, there have been numerous cases of chauffeurs colluding with bandits to steal vehicles. Reports to the police stations have been fruitless, with no trace to be found. The other day, detective Xie Zhiguang of the Route Gordon Police Station received confidential information and arrested Yu Jinfu, a Tongzhou native, at 19 Lane 646, Route Say Zoong, the ringleader specializing in stealing such vehicles. He was dressed in a Western suit and was unusually handsome. This place is the home of Zhang Qinshi, a female relative and fellow villager of his, and is the general headquarters for stealing automobiles. Two Browning six-round automatic pistols were also seized, with police registration licenses F269 and 2714, and were taken to the police station for detention. Yesterday morning, the police station applied for detention in accordance with Articles 76 and 111, and stated that recently, the theft of the above-mentioned automobiles had been endless. They were sold at the lowest prices and transported to other ports. The criminal Yu Jinfu came to Shanghai from Suzhou and happened to go to Zhang Qinshi's house to negotiate the purchase of vehicles to be shipped to the Suzhou area. He was working as a chauffeur in a certain organization, which was undoubtedly a case of divine justice, as he had thrown himself into the net. He gave vague confessions. According to Zhang Qinshi, the two pistols were previously used by her husband and were not used for illegal purposes. The court ordered them to be remanded separately for investigation and verification at a later date.

### Terror Drill Held Yesterday in the Chongqing Road Area

In recent days, the Shanghai Municipal Council has been actively and tirelessly strengthening the security within the concession. In addition to stepping up the arrest of petty criminals and intensifying defense, it has also successively held terror drills in various districts to allow police officers and self-defense corps members to familiarize themselves with everything. Yesterday afternoon, around 3 p.m., the Chengdu Road Police Station held a terror drill in the Chongqing Road and Dagu Road area within its jurisdiction, which lasted for one hour before it was completed. At that time, traffic on all roads was temporarily interrupted, but the order was exceptionally good.

### Talking About Eating with Hu Pu'an

Talking about eating is a very mundane topic, and what good would come of talking about it? But in today's world, discussing how to eat is truly the only thing people in society talk about. Moreover, what we're discussing here is merely eating, not the people's livelihood, so there shouldn't be any harm in it.

Mr. Hu Pu'an suffered a cerebral hemorrhage two years ago, resulting in hemiplegia. When he was ill, I visited him. This old man was truly extraordinary, using books as pillows and reading tirelessly. I thought it wasn't suitable for someone in his condition and tried to dissuade him. More than a year has passed in a flash, and due to my laziness in visiting old friends, I haven't been there even once. Last month, I received a letter from him, which read, "I have long been confined to my home, but fortunately, my mind has not deteriorated, and I can still read." Opening the letter, I couldn't help but feel ashamed. It is equally wrong to not visit someone whom you should visit. But since Pu'an cannot visit others, those who can visit him should do so. If one can visit but doesn't, it would be a breach of duty. Therefore, despite my laziness in visiting friends, I had to summon my courage and visit him at his home.

After two years of quiet recuperation, Pu'an has made significant progress. His illness has subsided by seventy percent, with only his left leg slightly impaired. His long beard is like silver silk, and although it was once shaved, it now flows like that of a celestial being. He had to give up Tai Chi boxing and swordsmanship due to his illness, but his piercing gaze and imposing demeanor still rival Chu Biao from the Shi Gong An stories. Besides reminiscing and chatting, we also discussed the difficulty of the eating problem.

Pu'an said, "With my appetite, no matter how expensive rice becomes, it has little impact." I said that one cannot be compared to you. With your vitality and spirit, you must have a method for maintaining your health. Then, I went on to talk about Pu'an's art of eating.

Pu'an said, "Before the war, I wouldn't stop until I had three bowls of rice per meal. Since the war began, as the price of rice has increased daily, my appetite has gradually decreased. Now, I only eat one bowl of rice per day, which is only about one teacup when poured into one!" It can be inferred that the amount he has saved is not just two-thirds, but actually three-quarters. Yet Pu'an's spirit has not diminished. In fact, his reading and memory have improved. This shows that proper dieting does not harm one's health.

Pu'an has three meals a day, porridge in the morning and evening, and rice at noon, each limited to one small bowl. Although he eats little, he spends a long time chewing. Whether it's porridge or rice, he chews each mouthful until it becomes a thin paste before swallowing. In other words, he not only avoids swallowing whole grains of rice or porridge, but also ensures that any remaining residue is thoroughly mixed with saliva before he considers his meal complete. Therefore, it takes him at least twenty minutes to finish one bowl of rice, ensuring no waste, with every grain entering his stomach to provide nourishment and vitality. Compared to those who eat three or four bowls of rice per meal, he is no less energetic. He writes for seven hours a day without feeling tired, sleeps for four or five hours without feeling it's too little, and writes over 300,000 words a year without feeling it's too much. He still has plenty of energy for socializing and conversation. Eating is not about quantity, but about the quality of chewing. In today's difficult times, his approach is worth emulating.

Moreover, Pu'an's strengths extend beyond this. People who talk about dieting and hygiene often emphasize the need for milk, eggs, fruits, vegetables, fish, and meat, highlighting the fats, proteins, vitamins, iron, phosphorus, and chlorophyll in each. They believe that only by harmonizing these elements can one achieve true nourishment, maintain health, and enjoy longevity. Even if successful, this lifestyle is a luxury. Leaving aside today's high prices, even in the past, it was not easily attainable for the average wealthy person. However, Pu'an's method is simple, practical, and economical. He doesn't find it expensive at all, and many consider it unattainable. Pu'an doesn't emphasize side dishes with each meal. He eats plain porridge or plain rice. After the meal, he only takes a small dish of green vegetables, chewing them carefully, swallowing the essence, and discarding the residue. Besides this, he has no delicacies, nor any milk or eggs. Yet Pu'an doesn't feel any deficiency in his health because of this. On the contrary, his original illness has been gradually recovering. However, Pu'an's success is not only due to his proper dieting but also to his peaceful recuperation. His daily three two-hour sessions of meditation greatly benefit his health and cannot be ignored. It is truly as they say:

Chewing with deep skill,
Every grain brings spirit.
Rice is hard to buy and eat,
Quietly nurture and preserve your nature.

Dieting can prolong life, while overeating can harm it. This applies regardless of whether it's rice, noodles, fish, meat, fruits, or vegetables; the pros and cons are the same. But the world values overeating, whether in health or illness. Food during illness is the most crucial; one mistake can worsen the condition. Although nutrition is essential during illness, diet should still be cautious. In the past, Western medicine didn't emphasize dietary restrictions and even considered them wrong, but now many recognize the importance of avoiding certain foods and moderating others. This shows the inseparable relationship between diet and health. Some who highly value nutrition may consider Pu'an's approach inadequate, and I've had similar thoughts. But Pu'an says otherwise, as long as it's done properly and consistently, a little is harmless, and simplicity doesn't matter. Even with eight hours of work, one doesn't feel tired. It's like soldiers, not in number, but in quality. The essence of quality is not in delicacies but in the quality of chewing, so that every grain has its nourishment and every vegetable has its function. That's all there is to it. Although, for those like Hang Yu and Xie Xu, who expend a lot of energy daily, Pu'an's method may be difficult to achieve.

However, dieting is the most ancient Chinese health practice. Zhang Liang's grain avoidance is one example. Later generations who talked about cultivation and longevity valued it even more. Recently, the results of Miss MacKay's practical experiments also show that maintaining a slight hunger can prolong life, which is consistent with Chinese health practices and the saying, "If you want children to be healthy, keep them slightly hungry and cold." Westerners often criticize Chinese people for eating too much. Indeed, the common view in China only recognizes that food provides nutrition, without considering whether it can be digested and beneficial. Seeing someone who eats heartily, they assume he has found the way to maintain health. Like Xue Rengui in novels, who "settled Tianshan with three arrows, and his soldiers sang as they entered Hangu Pass," people often talk about how big his appetite was, considering it a good thing, but historical records don't mention it. However, during the An Lushan Rebellion, the Tang general Zhang Xing ate a dou of rice and ten jin of meat per meal, wore armor, and wielded a Mo Dao weighing fifty jin. Such a person certainly existed, but ultimately, those with large appetites often suffer from gastrointestinal problems. Pu'an's way of eating porridge and rice can be said to favor the stomach but disadvantage the teeth. By torturing the teeth to turn food into a thin paste, the stomach and intestines can easily absorb it, saving a lot of work. Some say that elderly people's excrement is better fertilizer than that of the young because it's less digested and contains more nitrogen. If everyone digested like Pu'an, wouldn't the fields be disappointed? Nevertheless, Pu'an's way of eating is worth noting in this time of food scarcity. (Liu Tang)

### Roses Blooming Everywhere

These days, one can see roses in full bloom in quiet courtyards. There is a saying, "Roses bloom everywhere in the fourth month," and this is exactly that time. Roses belong to deciduous shrubs with thorny and dense branches, small oval leaves, and large five-petaled flowers in red, white, yellow, and other colors. When the roses begin to fade, spring is already old, and the greenery darkens as the reds thin out, symbolizing the approach of hot summer.

### Save the Deaf-Mute Refugee Children

The refugee camps have been closed and disbanded. However, there are still hundreds of old, weak, and disabled refugees who cannot be repatriated. These orphans, the elderly, the weak, the young, the insane, and the disabled are all pitiful creatures in the world, who have tasted the bitterness of life. Among them, the most pitiful are the deaf-mute refugee children. They suffer from a double disability. They have ears but cannot hear beautiful music or gentle language. They have mouths but cannot express their will or report their illnesses. From childhood to old age, they are in this painful state, stifling their voices, living in a daze. From an educational standpoint, they are the most promising among the disabled. They possess the necessary conditions for working in life: keen eyes and capable hands. They only need special education to transform from useless, resource-consuming people into useful, productive citizens. Therefore, educating the deaf-mute is a proactive effort, not passive charity. Mrs. Mi of the China Inland Mission, recognizing this, has consulted with the authorities of the Fuya School to find a way to educate and care for them.

The first step has been agreed upon. The Fuya School will send a teacher to the camp for three hours a day. All six deaf-mute students of school age will be provided with books, stationery, and the teacher's transportation expenses by the Fuya School, fulfilling their obligation to mutual assistance. This has been implemented since late April. There are still four young children who will have to wait for another day.

The second step is that educating the deaf-mute will not show immediate results. It must proceed step by step, like educating ordinary children, to advance in order. If they can complete senior primary school, they can communicate with ordinary people through writing and find employment without difficulty. Therefore, the six deaf-mute students urgently need to enter the school for full-day special education. Currently, the cost of living is high, and the school's finances are strained. However, they are willing to plan and manage the education costs completely free of charge. The problem of clothing and food relies on the help of enthusiastic people in society. Therefore, we are appealing on behalf of the deaf-mute refugee children, respectfully calling on philanthropists to open their purses, do good for the deaf-mute, and accumulate immeasurable merit. If you are willing to sponsor the clothing and food expenses of one or more children, please notify the Fuya School. They will immediately contact you to handle the matter. The address of the Fuya School is No. 33, Huayuan Road, Huangjiasha, Carter Road, telephone 32948.

### Mr. Pu Qiting Donates Xia Yao Shui

Our newspaper received a letter from Mr. Pu Qiting yesterday, which reads: "Dear Sir, recently, prices have soared, and life has become increasingly difficult. Summer is approaching, and epidemics are bound to be rampant. Poor compatriots are not only worried about their daily necessities but also feel the pain of illness. My wife, Zou Yunyu, and I cannot bear to sit idly by seeing the misery of their groans. Therefore, we sold our clothes and saved from our daily expenses, totaling over a thousand yuan, to purchase five hundred bottles of Xia Yao Shui from the Kefa Pharmacy. We request your newspaper and the Xinwen Bao (250 bottles each) to distribute them on our behalf. Although it is a drop in the bucket, it expresses our concern. I trouble your efforts and wish all colleagues of your newspaper good health. Pu Qiting, May 25th."

The service column notes that we have followed Mr. Pu's wishes and distributed the medicine accordingly, limited to in-person requests, while supplies last. We also thank Mr. Pu.

Donating Injury Medicine. Mr. Wu's residence at No. 11, Zhicheng Lane, near the Siming Hospital on Avenue Haig in the French Concession, has been donating injury medicine to all sectors for over ten years, at considerable expense. In the past, in-person requests were granted without limit. However, due to improper storage, the medicine has lost its effectiveness and harmed patients. Now, due to the exorbitant price of medicine, we are forced to limit each person to one dose, starting from today, to save costs and benefit patients.

### All Bonds Rise to Limit in 20 Minutes

The over-the-counter market for public bonds yesterday was still in a buying frenzy, with prices rising sharply. After an initial dip, prices soared, and within 20 minutes, all bonds hit their daily limit. All bonds rose by more than 4 yuan. The rapid rise in prices and the excitement of the market were unseen in recent months. Sellers accounted for less than two-thirds, while buyers were numerous. There were only buyers in the market, with sellers being few. The sluggish atmosphere of the past few months was completely swept away. This shows that the bulls have won, and their strength has surpassed the bears' actual assets. Therefore, the heavy pressure from the bears was ignored by the bulls. With all commodities rising wildly, public bonds could not be an exception, which also proves the direction of the market. The selling volume of Tongli was no less than on Saturday, and the selling volume of Tongkang and Hu Heji was also considerable. The selling of Jinfeng, Zhenhua, and Yongkang Tongyuan, however, was only nominal. Lianyi was the most aggressive buyer, with Chengkang, Runde, Wuhe, Yuanhe, and Hongda also actively absorbing. Yitai, Hongxing, Shuntai, Xinji, Renfeng, Xinhua, Jiufeng, and Hengfu also participated in the buying. Prices opened a little lower by one or two yuan, then rose rapidly, hitting the limit in a straight line, without any setbacks. The situation was excellent. In the current environment, there is no room for small-scale trading. As a result, all bonds rose by 4 yuan and hit their limits. Even after the market closed, there was still considerable buying. The total transaction volume was about 3 million yuan. A summary table is listed below:

### Stock Buyers More Enthusiastic

### Higher Head Discount: Xia Chi Rises to 40,000 Yuan

Yesterday, the black market for cash Xia Chi saw an astonishing rise in prices, escalating even further. The price has risen to the 40,000 yuan mark, with demand exceeding supply. The market is thriving due to the currency system changes, the wild rise in military notes and cotton yarn, and the sudden influx of buyers from Tianjin. Transactions were brisk. From the morning, each strip (10 taels) of cloth was seen rising to an unprecedented high price of 40,000 yuan amidst unanimous buying, 10,300 yuan higher than the noon closing price last Saturday and 6,000 yuan higher than the afternoon price. The selling of actual goods was from the Jin Hao gang, a certain securities firm, and a certain gang. Military notes once fell back, and the price also dropped by 5,000 yuan, retreating to 35,000 yuan. The Tianjin gang commissioned two securities firms to buy, and even with a 200 yuan discount on a 1,000 yuan head, the price rose by over 1,000 yuan. The noon closing price was 36,300 yuan, 6,600 yuan higher than the noon closing price last Saturday and 2,000 yuan higher than the afternoon price.

### Foreign Currencies Rise Sharply

US dollar notes rose to 50 yuan, and Hong Kong notes also rose to 7.5 yuan. Military notes opened at 13.4 yuan in the morning, rose to 13.7 yuan, then fell slightly to 11.7 yuan, and finally closed at 12 yuan, all head-discount prices, a sharp increase of 2.7 yuan compared to last week. The exchange rate for cash to military notes was 10 yuan and 11 yuan.

Yesterday, the discount rate for bank drafts was initially 130 yuan per 1,000 yuan, then gradually rose, reaching over 200 yuan at noon, and around 250 or 260 yuan in the afternoon, another increase of over 50 yuan. Cash is increasingly scarce. The interbank rate of the Money Trade Association remained at 1.5%, while the premium for Central Reserve Certificates initially rose to 3 yuan, then retreated from 3.2 yuan to 2.4 yuan. Ultimately, one Central Reserve Certificate could be exchanged for 3.1 to 3.3 old legal tender yuan. For cash, one yuan could be exchanged for 2.2 to 2.5 yuan.

### Although Actual Sales Are Sluggish, Double Horse Mill Tickets Exceed the 10,000 Yuan Mark

The cotton yarn market followed the fluctuations of the currency and tended to rise, but actual transactions remained sluggish as usual.

The opening price for 20s Double Horse mill tickets was 9,300 yuan. At this time, due to the chaotic financial situation, the shouting on the trading floor was deafening. The market gradually advanced, rising to 10,150 yuan. However, some profit-takers sold, easing it back to 9,000 yuan. By closing, it had risen again to 9,700 yuan. In the afternoon, there were rumors of exceeding the 10,000 yuan mark.

### Cloth Prices Soar, Utter Chaos

Cloth Market. Yesterday, the cloth market was still affected by the wild rise in military notes and Central Reserve Certificates, and the price increase was unprecedented. Trading was like being in a storm, especially with Taohua Lady Lin cloth mill tickets. The opening price in the morning was 510 yuan, which soared to a high of 575 yuan, then fell back to 495 yuan. The noon closing price was 520 yuan. It started at 530 yuan in the afternoon and rose again to 555 yuan. The closing price in the evening was 550 yuan, a huge increase of 80 yuan per piece compared to the market last week. Other cloths also rose uniformly. 16-pound Flying Hong coarse cloth mill tickets were at 405 yuan, Earth coarse cloth at 412 yuan, 12-pound Dapeng fine cloth at 405 yuan, Earth at 400 yuan, and Fugui at 395 yuan, all increasing by about 50 yuan per piece. Poplin also saw strong price increases, with Changshou at 13.5 yuan, Changting at 13 yuan, Yue Mei new style at 9 yuan, and Pai Qiu at 8.5 yuan.

Eastern Cloth. Prices initially rose, then fell back, but ultimately rose again. The opening price for Longtou fine cloth new tickets was 448 yuan in the morning, reaching a high of 455 yuan, then falling to 428 yuan. The noon closing price was 440 yuan. It started at 445 yuan in the afternoon and rose directly to 456 yuan, then fell back to 445 yuan for the evening closing, an increase of 30 yuan per piece. The closing price for mid-range Colorful Ball fine cloth was 392 yuan, Flying Fish at 375 yuan, and Four Gentlemen Serge reached a high of 16.75 yuan, with a low of 15.45 yuan, and an evening closing of 16.15 yuan. The market was very chaotic.

### Green Woolen Fabrics Almost Completely Bought Up

The woolen fabric market was affected by the high prices of military notes and Central Reserve Certificates. Market sentiment was unusually strong, with actual sales lacking and continued reduction of forward contracts. The market trended firm. Autumn and winter goods were particularly tight. The grass green color of Huate woolen fabric, riding breeches, and thick and thin serge fabrics saw even sharper price increases in recent days. Yihai No. 1 to 28 riding breeches sold for 280 yuan per yard, Yinfeng brand at 265-266 yuan, Caishen Tiger grass green Huate woolen fabric sold for 250 yuan, Dalong Yangcheng brand at 215 yuan, and Yangcheng serge at 160 yuan. Yinfeng serge was at 185 yuan. A large portion had been almost completely bought up by a certain party. The factory determined that they would not be able to produce more of the grass green color because the dye had been discontinued, so it was certain that it would disappear. As a result, the limited inventory currently circulating in the market was being hoarded, leading to unusual speculation.
