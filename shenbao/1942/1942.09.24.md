### Envoy's Address

The Envoy's address is as follows: Your Excellency, after the Imperial Government recognized the National Government and Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations were restored, Your Excellency personally visited the Empire to express gratitude for the Imperial Government's assistance. At the same time, candid discussions were held with the Imperial Government regarding cooperative issues between the two countries. Subsequently, National Government Member and Minister of Foreign Affairs, Chu Minyi, was appointed as a special envoy to the Empire. The envoy was dispatched to express congratulations on the victories of the Imperial Army since the beginning of the Greater East Asia War, and to express the National Government's determination and enthusiasm to share weal and woe with the Empire in jointly establishing the great cause of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. This has greatly benefited the enhancement of the good and intimate relationship between the two countries. We, the envoys, are now commissioned by His Majesty the Emperor to return the goodwill of the Government of the Republic of China and to further strengthen the ties between the two countries. In the capacity of special ambassadors, we are sent to your esteemed country. Today, we are honored to be received and to respectfully present the credentials of His Majesty the Emperor to Your Excellency, the Chairman of the National Government of the Republic of China. This is the greatest honor for us. Ensuring the stability of East Asia and contributing to world peace and prosperity are the unwavering national policies of the Empire. Maintaining friendly relations with all countries and ensuring that all nations under heaven find their proper place are the essential principles of the Empire's foreign policy. Now, the Empire is assisting the extension of Your Excellency's national strength, and Your Excellency is well aware of the Empire's true intentions. In particular, after the Empire declared war on Britain and the United States on December 8th of last year for self-preservation and the establishment of lasting peace in East Asia, Your Excellency's government immediately declared its determination to face the difficult situation with an unwavering spirit of sharing weal and woe. Now, both materially and spiritually, the effectiveness of cooperation is being demonstrated. This is something that the Empire deeply appreciates. The Imperial Government, in view of the importance of its mission, upholds the sacred will of His Majesty the Emperor, internally strengthening its unity from top to bottom, and externally deepening its alliance with allied countries based on trust and righteousness, in order to complete the holy war. We, the envoys, sincerely express our congratulations on the increasingly solid cooperation between China and Japan today, and on the fact that the people of both countries are joining hands to advance towards the establishment of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. At the same time, we are confident that the enduring friendship between the two countries will never be shaken. I respectfully wish Your Excellency good health and wish your esteemed country prosperity.

### Chairman's Reply

Your Excellency the Special Envoy, since the signing of the Sino-Japanese Basic Treaty, diplomatic relations between the two countries have been restored to normalcy and have become even closer. Last year, I had the honor of visiting your esteemed country to express gratitude for the sincere sympathy and enthusiastic assistance extended by your esteemed country, and to conduct candid discussions on various issues requiring cooperation. This year, I also dispatched National Government Member and Minister of Foreign Affairs Chu Minyi as a special envoy to visit your esteemed country to convey the firm determination of the Government of this country to share weal and woe with your esteemed country after the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, in order to achieve the liberation of East Asia. I have been deeply moved by the courtesy extended by the imperial family of your esteemed country and the welcome extended by all sectors of society. I am deeply pleased that this return visit by the special envoy will further consolidate the alliance between the two countries and further strengthen our friendly relations. For thousands of years, both of our countries have revered morality and righteousness. The basic spirit of the treaty signed two years ago lies in this. In the future, we should adhere to morality and righteousness, love and assist each other, in order to realize the common prosperity of East Asia. Your esteemed country is now striving to eliminate the aggressive forces of Britain and the United States, and bears great responsibility. The Government of this country is determined to share this difficult task with your esteemed country and will sincerely assist in every way possible. The Government of this country firmly believes that the security of our two countries is interdependent and that our close friendship will last forever. I respectfully wish His Majesty the Emperor of your esteemed country good health, prosperity to your esteemed country, and a pleasant and peaceful journey to Your Excellency the Special Envoy.

Nanjing, 23rd (Central News Agency)

After Special Envoy Hiruma of the Japanese goodwill mission led all members of the mission to meet the Chairman at the National Government on the morning of the 23rd, they returned to their official residence for rest. Chairman Wang specially dispatched Chief Military Counselor Tang to the special envoy's official residence at the Guest House at 10:30 AM this morning to deliver a return visit. The special envoy expressed his deep pleasure at the representative's return visit, and they engaged in cheerful conversation. Chief Military Counselor Tang took his leave after several tens of minutes.

Nanjing, 23rd (Central News Agency)

The three special envoys, Hiruma, and others, received Chinese and foreign journalists in the capital at 3:00 PM on the 23rd and issued the following statement: Premier Wang Jingwei of the National Government paid a goodwill visit to Japan. Subsequently, Minister of Foreign Affairs Chu Minyi also visited Japan with the mandate of the National Government. In order to reciprocate the National Government's friendship, the Japanese Imperial Government has specially dispatched us as envoys to China to further strengthen cooperation between China and Japan. Today, we had the honor of meeting Chairman Wang at the National Government Auditorium and presenting our credentials. We feel the greatest honor and gratitude. Establishing stability in Greater East Asia to contribute to world peace is the founding spirit of our country and the unwavering foundation of the Japanese Empire. To establish stability in Greater East Asia, it is most important for China, Japan, and Manchukuo, which have the closest geographical, historical, and economic relations, to cooperate with each other for coexistence and co-prosperity. Looking at the recent international situation, Germany and Italy in Europe are also devoting their full efforts to building a Co-Prosperity Sphere in Europe with the same spirit. If these two Co-Prosperity Spheres in the East and West can combine their strengths in close cooperation, they will be able to build comprehensive world peace. This is what we firmly believe. After the Imperial Government announced the statement of good neighborly friendship, joint defense against communism, economic cooperation, and the establishment of a new order in East Asia at the end of 1938 (Republic of China year 27), Chairman Wang Jingwei, with his patriotic zeal, left Chongqing and called for peace and national construction as the only way to save China from decline. Since then, disregarding difficulties and dangers, and valuing the interests of the country and the people, he has worked tirelessly with the belief that the stability of East Asia requires cooperation between China and Japan. On March 30, 1940 (Showa 15), the National Government returned to Nanjing. We, the special envoys, express our deep respect for the hardships endured by Chairman Wang and his comrades of the National Government before their return to the capital. At the same time, we extend our heartfelt congratulations on the sound development of the National Government. After the National Government returned to Nanjing, the Empire immediately began treaty negotiations with it in order to adjust relations between the two countries. Thanks to the deep understanding between the two governments, the Sino-Japanese Basic Treaty was signed on November 30 of the same year. At the same time, a joint declaration by China, Japan, and Manchukuo was issued, and the National Government officially recognized Manchukuo. The three countries of China, Japan, and Manchukuo are working hand in hand to build a new order in East Asia, thereby establishing a foundation. The Japanese Imperial Government is determined to strengthen cooperation with the National Government in accordance with the provisions of the Sino-Japanese Basic Treaty, and sincerely hopes that the National Government will fully exercise its functions and share the responsibility of building a new order in East Asia with the Japanese Imperial Government. On December 8 of last year, the Japanese Empire declared war on the United States and Britain for self-preservation and the establishment of permanent peace in Greater East Asia. The National Government immediately declared its cooperation with Japan in the spirit of sharing weal and woe, and put forward items such as thrift and consumption, expanded production, guiding ideology, and mass movements to strengthen the National Army. Whether in material or spiritual aspects, it has done its utmost to assist the Empire. Our government is deeply grateful to the Imperial Government, and we express our deepest gratitude. After the Imperial Government went to war with Britain and the United States, it relied on the sacred authority to drive the enemy forces out of the Western Pacific and the Indian Ocean. The war has now been extended to the Eastern Pacific, the northern coast of Australia, and the coast of South Africa. On the mainland, the defense of the periphery has become more consolidated. The attack points in Zhejiang and Jiangxi provinces have been defeated. In short, all military strongholds in Greater East Asia have fallen into our hands, and the foundation for victory has been laid. At the same time, the construction of the occupied territories in the South Seas is also making positive progress with the cooperation of all parties. Thinking of this makes people feel inspired. Although the United States and Britain are now doing their utmost to reverse the decline of the early battles, the Japanese Empire will never be intoxicated by the early victories. It is now firmly adhering to its belief in certain victory and enduring the greatest difficulties and hardships to preserve the glory of the Empire and complete the construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. We, the envoys, have come to China to personally witness the current situation of the new China and deeply feel that China and Japan must cooperate more closely in order to build the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. We wish it a boundless future.

### Shigemitsu's Banquet

Nanjing, 23rd (Domei News Agency)

Japanese Ambassador to China, Shigemitsu Aoi, hosted a banquet at the International Club tonight in honor of Chairman Wang Jingwei, Special Envoys Hiruma, Arita, Nagai, and accompanying staff all attended the banquet. During the banquet, Shigemitsu Aoi declared that, in light of the current international situation, it is very clear that Sino-Japanese cooperation will be able to achieve the goal of rebuilding East Asia. Because Hiruma clearly stated this morning about the Japanese policy towards the relationship between China and Japan, Chairman Wang also hopes to increase cooperation. Therefore, the Japanese ambassador pointed out that there is no need to make further explicit statements about the relationship between the two countries, and that these three special envoys are all experienced politicians, which shows that Japan wants to strengthen its ties with China. On the other hand, the visits of Chairman Wang and Chu Minyi to Japan in June of last year and July of this year have made the relationship between China and Japan quite close. Among those who attended this banquet were Chen Gongbo, Liang Hongzhi, Wen Zongyao, Jiang Kanghu, Zhou Fohai, Chu Minyi, and others from the National Government, as well as Japanese military and naval aides-de-camp, consuls-general, the Asia Development Board, economic advisors, and ambassadors from Manchuria, Germany, and Italy.

According to the regulations, the number of people on board the ship should not exceed 300 at most, but the British side actually ordered 871 Japanese nationals to board the ship, causing most of the Japanese to only be able to sleep on the hanging wood in the ship's cabin for storing goods during the 15-day voyage, and all matters such as cooking and cleaning had to be handled by themselves.

### Model Zones Designated for Blackout Drills; All Lights Must Be Perfectly Concealed, But Citizens' Lives Must Follow Normal Routines

### Blackout Curtains Should Be Thick Cloth

According to the Air Defense Section of the Public Concession Police Department, some households have used blackout curtains that are too thin and are not satisfied. Therefore, citizens are requested to buy cloth. As for those who cannot afford cloth, they can use several sheets of newspaper coated with black ink.

### Life Should Continue as Normal During Drills

On the evenings of the 22nd (yesterday) and 23rd (today), the designated model zones in the Hongkou Jiaxing District and Jing'an Temple District have successively conducted small-scale blackout drills. The middle section of Avenue Joffre in the French Concession is the same. According to an official of the Air Defense Section of the Public Concession, the zones where the Public Concession will hold the next blackout drills on Friday and Saturday are in the Yulin Road District. The French Concession has also designated model zones to hold blackout drills every night. Baojia personnel, Lieutenant Colonel Faber, Director-General of the French Police Department, and police officers inspect the blackout performance of each building in the drill zone. It is found that small-scale blackouts have been held in the Weisi District, Jing'an Temple Road District, and Jiaxing Road District of the Public Concession. The head of the Air Defense Section, Matsumoto, personally visited the scene to inspect. According to official sources, residents of the drill zone should continue their lives as normal after taking the necessary preparations, and shops should operate as usual. If they only turn off the lights and sleep, it would be contrary to the original intention of the drill.

### Monthly Consumption of Household Rice is 110,000 Bags

Since the implementation of the grain rationing system in the two concessions on July 6, a total of 399,984 shi of whole rice and broken rice, equivalent to 319,987 bags, have been distributed by the 19th of this month. Among them, the Public Concession accounted for 259,800 shi, equivalent to 207,840 bags, and the French Concession accounted for 140,184 shi, equivalent to 112,147 bags.

If each person is given two sheng of rice each time, the monthly consumption of rice in the two concessions will be 141,171 shi, equivalent to 112,937 bags. As for the source of rice, the highest authorities in this port have already compiled the distribution matters, and the Grain Office of the Public Concession is responsible for the deployment. In the future, rice will continue to be shipped from rice-producing areas in Central China to Shanghai for sale, and the citizens of this port are accustomed to using miscellaneous grains, flour, and other ingredients as daily food, so grain rationing will not be insufficient, and the entire situation of people's livelihood can be restored to stability from the turbulence.

### Haitong Steamship Company Generously Agrees to Transport Coffins to Ningbo

Undertaken by the Guohua Coffin Transportation Department

The task of transporting coffins from this city is handled by the Guohua Coffin Transportation Department, which works diligently. It accepts applications for free or reduced-fee transportation for impoverished families in eastern Zhejiang without limit and receives assistance from various individuals. These impoverished coffins were originally transported to Ningbo by sailing boats, but every autumn, the tides are high, and the winds and waves are strong, making sailing boat transportation dangerous. The department, recognizing its significant responsibility, dares not neglect this matter. It has contacted Mr. Du Desheng, the owner of the Haitong Steamship Company, who has generously agreed to provide assistance free of charge. Starting next week, all impoverished coffins will be transported to Ningbo by Haitong ships. Each voyage can carry one to two hundred coffins. It is reported that starting from the 27th of this month, impoverished coffins will be loaded onto ships and transported to Ningbo in the order of registration for a more stable and faster journey.

### Prices of Beef, Vegetables, and Fruits to Be Controlled, Implemented Gradually Starting Next Week, to Improve Wholesale System as a Mechanism to Suppress Prices; System for Purchasing Goods with Coupons Still Under Study

Mr. Inauryo, head of the Commodities Control Section of the Public Works Department, stated that the price of beef sold in vegetable markets and restaurants in this city will be reduced starting next week.

The price of pork will not be affected, as it is already under control. The real threat to beef prices is the middlemen. Taking action against these middlemen or improving their behavior can strictly control beef prices, providing some relief to the common people's food problems. According to a detailed investigation by the Commodities Control Section, strictly controlling meat prices and setting price limits will not lead to beef disappearing from the market. The market price of livestock has already been adjusted, so suppliers of livestock will not be affected by the control. The prices of meat and bones at slaughterhouses have also been limited. The profiteering is actually happening after the beef leaves the slaughterhouse. In other words, the root cause of high beef prices

is in this city.

It is believed that rectification is not impossible. Therefore, controlling meat prices has a good chance of success. The way to rectify this is to improve the wholesale system, which is under study. Once the middlemen are eliminated, meat eaters will be able to reduce their burden. Mr. Inauryo also stated that the Commodities Control Section has not yet thoroughly investigated the supply and retail of vegetables and cannot decide on a control method. However, favorable news regarding stabilizing fruit prices is expected to be announced soon. Currently, the Commodities Control Section is most focused on controlling the prices of meat, vegetables, and fruits. The section is now also engaged in basic work to extend the control method to other important items. The public is encouraged to send letters to the Commodities Control Section of the Public Works Department with any complaints and suggestions regarding controlled prices. The authorities are currently studying a

coupon purchase

system that can be expanded and applied to other items, such as purchasing rice, noodles, and butter. However, the prices of some items have been relatively stable since the end of May. Unless there is a shortage of some items, it is not expected that control will be implemented.

### French Municipal Council Formally Announces Issuance of 5 Million Yuan in Public Bonds

New Roads Will Be Constructed with Allocated Funds

Mr. Tan Gutti, the superintendent of the French Concession's Municipal Council, discussed the Council's formal announcement of the issuance of public bonds, stating that the Council will issue 5 million yuan in public bonds

to expand public works

to carry out an expansion program for road construction, public service improvements, drainage system improvements, and other civil improvements. However, this program is long-term in nature and will be implemented starting early next year. The Council has already completed its road construction program for this year. The roads in the French Concession are currently in good condition, and no repairs are necessary this year. Future programs will include repairing and building multiple roads, such as Rue Reinsdaer, which is only half-built. The streetlights and other public facilities on these new roads will be expanded, creating traffic shortcuts and providing more convenience for the increasing number of cyclists.

Drainage will also be improved

Plans to prevent flooding will also be carried out. In short, with the issuance of 5 million yuan in public bonds, the Council's civil improvement policy will be greatly advanced. The Council last issued public bonds in 1936.

### What Evening is This? Only Talk of the Bright Moon

— Feng Liutang

Treading on the moon, admiring the moon, raising a glass to invite the moon, singing of the wind, and playing with the moon, and even waiting for the moon in the West Chamber. What I am talking about is not to create something new but to collect old news. However, since the predecessors have never written such a discussion, how can I not take advantage of this good night to talk about it?

### Chang'e Stole the Medicine and Eloped to the Moon

The story of Chang'e, also known as Heng'e, eloping to the moon occurred more than 4,000 years ago (around 1150-1160 BC in the Western calendar). During the Xia Dynasty, Hou Yi usurped the throne from Emperor Xiang and sought the elixir of immortality from the Queen Mother of the West. Heng'e stole it and fled to the moon. Zhang Heng of the Han Dynasty wrote in "Ling Xian":

"Yi requested the elixir of immortality from the Queen Mother of the West. Heng'e stole it and fled to the moon. Before going, he divined with the 'You Huang' hexagram. The divination said 'Auspicious. A graceful woman will go west alone. Encountering darkness and obscurity, fear and trepidation will turn into great prosperity.' Heng'e then entrusted herself to the moon, becoming a toad." Thus, the toad is the transformation of Heng'e. Later generations called the moon palace the Toad Palace, which is the origin of this. Some say that there is a rabbit in the moon, which is Heng'e pounding medicine. The crow in the sun and the rabbit in the moon both come from the words of ancient astronomers. Later generations used the saying that Heng'e stole the medicine as an established theory. It can also be proven by the text of "Ling Xian".

"The sun is the essence of yang, accumulating and becoming a crow. The crow has three toes, like the number of yang, which is odd. The moon is the essence of yin, accumulating and becoming a beast, like a rabbit. The number of yin is even."

In fact, the so-called sun crow is a sunspot, and the moon rabbit is a mark in the moon. They are all illusions obtained by observing celestial phenomena with the naked eye. The "Gan's Star Classic" says that in addition to the crow in the sun, there is also a rooster with two feet. In addition to the rabbit in the moon, there is also a toad with two feet, which is even more far-fetched.

Ancient people deeply doubted the saying that Chang'e entrusted herself to the moon and became a toad, thinking that it was impossible for a person to transform into a toad. They also did much research on Chang'e's origin, thinking that the Yellow Emperor ordered Yi He to observe the sun daily and Chang Yi to observe the moon, and that Chang'e was a mistaken transmission of Chang Yi. They also cited the annotations of the Zhou official to prove that the ancient pronunciations of the characters Yi and Yi were like E, so in the Han Dynasty inscriptions, "Liao E" was often written as "Yi Yi". Thus, because the sounds are similar, Chang Yi was mistakenly thought to be Chang'e.

From this, it can be seen that Chang'e was male, not female. Why was she made a woman, causing later generations to yearn for the immortal in the moon and create all kinds of nonsense? Someone said that this was a mistake from the "Classic of Mountains and Seas". Regardless of whether she is male or female, it is mostly mythology, so let's not talk about it. Let's talk about something else.

### Hoping to Pluck Laurel in the Toad Palace

Speaking of plucking laurel in the Toad Palace, it was today forty years ago that students were competing for a future and seeking a way out. In the imperial examination era of the former Qing Dynasty, provincial examinations were held in each province in the years of Zi, Wu, Mao, and You (this year is Ren Wu). If one passed the metropolitan examination the following year, it would be a world-shaking event. Taking off the blue gown and putting on the red robe, the most gratifying time in life would be none other than this. However, the treatment in the examination halls in the past was not as comfortable as it is today. Therefore, there was the saying that "Three sessions of hard work turn you into a ghost, and the two characters of fame and fortune mislead people." It can be imagined how difficult it was. It happened that the third session of the provincial examination fell on the Mid-Autumn Festival. If one passed this examination and obtained the title of Juren, one would immediately obtain it. If not, one would have to wait three years to come to the examination hall again and taste the situation of "three parts science, nine parts luck, and ten thousand kinds of sorrow during the examination period."

### Mid-Autumn Festival Coincides with the Autumn Equinox

The seventh, eighth, and ninth months of the lunar calendar are autumn months. The full moon of the eighth month is located in the middle, so it is named the Mid-Autumn Festival. In 1918, the Gregorian calendar was promoted, and all festivals such as Shangsi, Dragon Boat Festival, Qixi, Mid-Autumn Festival, and Double Ninth Festival were changed to the dates of the Gregorian calendar, such as March 3rd in the Gregorian calendar for Shangsi and May 5th for the Dragon Boat Festival. For example, taking August 15th as the Mid-Autumn Festival would inevitably lead to the lament that there is no bright moon during the Mid-Autumn Festival, so it was necessary to adapt to the lunar calendar and take the full moon closest to the autumn equinox as the Mid-Autumn Festival. The autumn equinox is originally in the eighth month, so the Mid-Autumn Festival is always around the autumn equinox. Moreover, the autumn equinox is the day when day and night are equally divided. The Mid-Autumn Festival and the autumn equinox are similar in meaning. However, the Mid-Autumn Festival coincides with the autumn equinox, which is as rare as the Year of the New Moon coinciding with the Spring Festival (the lunar New Year's Day in the coming year of 1932 will coincide with the Spring Festival), and the Summer Solstice rarely coinciding with the Dragon Boat Festival. This is similarly difficult due to the difference in the cycle of years. However, this year's Mid-Autumn Festival coincides with the autumn equinox. It is considered a coincidence. Before this, the autumn equinox in the eleventh year of Guangxu (Yi You) was the Mid-Autumn Festival. It has been fifty-eight years since then. After this, the autumn equinox in the sixty-ninth year of the Republic of China (Geng Shen) will coincide with the Mid-Autumn Festival again. However, due to the intercalation of leap months, if it falls in a year with a leap July in the Gregorian calendar, the solar term closest to the Mid-Autumn Festival is the Cold Dew, and the autumn equinox is close to the beginning of the eighth month. In a year with a leap eighth month, the nearest Mid-Autumn Festival is the White Dew, and the autumn equinox is at the end of the eighth month. Therefore, taking the full moon closest to the autumn equinox as the Mid-Autumn Festival in the eighth month of the lunar calendar will be considered inconsistent.

### Worshipping the Moon and Hoping to See the Beautiful Moon

There is a saying that the moon is beautiful every night during the Mid-Autumn Festival, so everyone hopes to see the true face of the beautiful moon. This is because the autumn air is clear, and white clouds are scattered. The moonlight is reflected back into it, causing a rainbow effect, with colorful and dazzling colors. This cannot be said to be inevitable, but it is difficult to encounter.

I have tried to ask people about this, and what they have heard and what they have not been able to see is the same as me. Only Mr. Zhu Zhiyao, an eighty-year-old man, has seen it with his own eyes. According to his account, on a moonlit night, the white dew horizontally crossed the sky, and autumn clouds were unrestrained. The moonlight passed through the canopy of trees, and only colorful clouds surrounded the moon in layers, like a canopy, with light radiating in all directions, which was extremely beautiful. Having heard his explanation, I thought about the streetlights seen on rainy nights. The light lines have never failed to have a rainbow around them, and the causes of their formation are probably the same.

### I Love the Moon, Clear and Bright

Every Mid-Autumn Festival, it is impossible to avoid hardship. This year is no exception. Looking at the mooncakes, I sigh. Facing the pears and lotus roots, I have no connection. I entrust the moon palace to the coming year, and I will wait for another day to buy incense. This is not complaining about poverty. It is the general feeling of resonance among the regular salaried class. Fortunately, Heng'e in the moon can see the price of goods from the clouds, getting closer and closer, and will naturally understand the hardships of the lower realm and will not blame us. Besides, the rations are mixed with flour. Rubbing and kneading, round and round, we can also make a cake to mark the occasion. Although it is said that there is no wine or delicacies for the Mid-Autumn Festival, can we not sing to the moon with blanched vegetables, white porridge, and tea as wine? At a moment of excitement, we can freely sing our natural tune without rhyme or rhythm: "I love the moon, clear and bright." The children hear the sound and follow along, looking at each other and enjoying themselves, completely forgetting the heavy burden of life. The bright moon is still overhead.

### Two Stories of Wounded Soldiers

— Lin Da

The globally renowned late Austrian psychologist Dr. Adler once told a true story. He said that during World War I, he treated two wounded soldiers in a military hospital. Both men underwent the same arm amputation surgery on the same day, with their right arms being removed at the shoulder.

Two years later, these two disabled men happened to visit Dr. Adler in the same week. One said, "Dr. Adler, without my right arm, I am truly helpless. I cannot work, and I have no hope of getting married. I have become a piece of wood—not a person." The other said, "Dr. Adler, although I have lost my right arm, my life is still very good. My current profession is even better than before I lost my arm. I am married and have a healthy son. Sometimes, I think that one arm is enough for a person. Why would God give us two?"

These two soldiers encountered the same misfortune under the same circumstances, but the results were completely different. Why? It was the difference in attitude and spirit. One was pessimistic, and the other was positive. One complained listlessly, while the other faced reality and mustered the spirit to fight for his future.

In these difficult times, many people inevitably suffer various blows and misfortunes, just like these two wounded soldiers. Perhaps some have lost their jobs, some are starving, some are poorly dressed in the cold, some are unable to continue their education due to economic pressure, and some have lost their loved ones and those they rely on. Under such circumstances, what attitude should we have? What should we do? Please remember the stories of the two wounded soldiers above.

### Random Thoughts on Mooncakes

— Qin Meng

Another Mid-Autumn Festival is approaching in the good scenery of the year. The streets and alleys generally appear tense. The market is busy collecting debts owed to others, and people must settle accounts by the festival. Households are busy preparing gifts and buying mooncakes to comfortably celebrate the festival.

As the name suggests, mooncakes are named because their shape resembles the moon. However, some have researched and said that its origin contains a tragic story, dating back to the end of the Yuan Dynasty. This is naturally believable. In China, food related to customs is often a grand or beautiful epic, as evidenced by zongzi, yuanxiao, qiaoguo, and Chongyang cakes.

Merchants are naturally first-rate at taking advantage of opportunities. How could they let go of the annual mooncake business? In these few days, if you take a stroll on the street, the windows are filled with mooncakes, the stalls are piled with mooncakes, and pedestrians are carrying large and small packages of mooncakes. The advertisements are especially diverse and attractive. Some boast about using authentic ingredients, while others claim to have pioneered scientific baking. One company, so-and-so Garden, even used a subtle writing style in the newspaper to publish a passage saying that after the summer diet, the stomach and intestines are extremely weak. The way to replenish them is to take advantage of this period to eat more mooncakes. The article then transitions to the main topic, saying that if you want to eat mooncakes, this is the only place to go. Mooncakes on the market are generally divided into Suzhou-style and Cantonese-style, which need no introduction. Cantonese-style emphasizes ingredients, has many patterns, and beautiful decorations. The disadvantage is that the price is too high. This year, a coconut or egg yolk type costs at least five yuan. The specially made large mooncakes displayed in the windows of the four companies on Nanjing Road are often priced at over a thousand yuan. Suzhou-style mooncakes are characterized by their small size, with a volume that is one-third of Cantonese-style and a price of only a few cents or one yuan. The disadvantage is that they do not last long.

A certain old foodie evaluated the merits of Suzhou and Cantonese mooncakes and concluded that Eastern food generally cannot avoid being rough, such as the Dragon-Tiger Grand Meeting's whole roasted pig. Cantonese mooncakes are the same. However, the softness of the crust and the baking method are indeed very advanced. Suzhou-style mooncakes do not improve and only have a few varieties such as rose salt and pepper, ham, and mixed nuts. However, they melt in your mouth and are delicious. It is especially delicious when baked. This discussion can be said to be quite insightful. If they did not each have their own characteristics, the sales power of the two factions would not have lasted this long.

It is said that each Cantonese mooncake company can do more than one million yuan in business each year. This year, each company expects to do four million yuan in business. Judging from the numbers, it is an improvement. However, in terms of currency value and profit, it is far from what it used to be. The decline in people's livelihoods and the decline in purchasing power are further proof of this.

### Sharing the Same Boat in Stormy Weather

— He Jia Zhi

(9) Human Hell

Wei Shaoyun saw that what he said was not working, yet like Copper Mountain collapsing in the east and Luoyang bells responding in the west, he and his father kneeled down in two places at the same time. Wei Yunqing kneeled before his subordinates, and Wei Shaoyun kneeled before the beauty. He kneeled down, his hands on Cui Zhen's knees, shaking her, saying, "Sister Cui Zhen, how can you not pity me? Look, many people outside are laughing at me. I don't care. I'm kowtowing, kowtowing loudly." He really kowtowed on the floor. Cui Zhen had never seen such a disreputable sight. She couldn't laugh or cry, but anger was possible. She raised her foot and kicked him hard.

This kick landed squarely on Wei Shaoyun's forehead. Wei Shaoyun was kneeling, and he tilted backward, tilting until he couldn't tilt any further. He rebounded forward like an elastic band, but went beyond his original kneeling posture and lunged forward, his forehead hitting the floor solidly, his back up, his chest down, lying straight. At this moment, a roar came from outside, and three or four people rushed in. Wei Shaoyun's brother-in-law was also among them. They helped Wei Shaoyun up. One said, "This woman's leg strength is quite something." Another said, "Ah, Master Wei's forehead is bleeding." Another said, "Close the door and don't let this woman escape." Cui Zhen hardened her heart, thinking that even if this guy died, it wouldn't be so terrible. She watched them help Wei Shaoyun out, watched them send someone to guard the door, then looked at the monthly calendars hanging on the walls, with images of Guan Yu and a bathing Consort Yang. On the dressing table were copper and tin utensils, and a clock with hands pointing to nine o'clock but chiming twelve. Then she looked at herself sitting in a reclining chair, the cushion not a chair cushion but a thin blue cloth bag. After a while, a woman poked her head in and shouted, "Don't look around! If my brother is willing to talk nicely, he'll even call his own mother. But if he's unwilling, don't think he'll spare you!" Cui Zhen turned her face to look at the woman's face, which somewhat resembled Wei Shaoyun's. (185)

### A Glimpse into the Money Industry

— Yi Wei

(II) A Candid Portrait of the Remittance Shop

The money industry is divided into two types: large and small firms. Small firms refer to the money exchange shops in the Sichuan Road and Jiangxi Road area. They have smaller capital but many types of businesses. In addition to exchange, they handle foreign exchange, government bonds, and cotton yarn, doing anything that is profitable. Large money shops, however, are different. Like banks, they are only allowed to do deposits, loans, and remittances, hence the name remittance shops. They all join the Money Industry Association and the Money Industry Reserve, and their cashier's checks are accepted by other firms and banks as cash and can be exchanged at the clearinghouse. Of course, their strength is also greater than that of small firms. According to recent regulations, the capital must be over one million yuan, but in reality, many are below this amount. However, with the addition of accumulated reserves and term deposits, the difference is limited. Most of them are distributed in the Ningbo Road and Tianjin Road area, with a total of about forty or fifty. The following discussion concerns these types of remittance shops.

The doors open at nine o'clock every morning. Outside the long counter with iron railings, there is a constant stream of customers and other firms or bank clerks coming and going. They are entering or paying cashier's checks to the transactions department, sending cash or paying cash to the cashier department, and sending in remittance slips or collecting from the interbank transactions department. These three departments are the ordinary operating agencies of a remittance shop. The activity lasts until three o'clock in the afternoon, but this is only for external operations. The internal organization, from the manager (commonly known as the "first-in-charge") down, includes assistant managers, clearing houses or internal ledgers, external ledger account money houses, credit houses, runners, guild runners, exchange of bills, and other small clerks and apprentices with no fixed responsibilities. The manager wields great power, with complete authority over shareholders and operations. The appointment of staff, distribution of work, and the generosity of treatment often depend on the closeness of the relationship and the size of the recommender's reputation. In some feudal remittance shops, there is also a supervisor above the manager, like a retired emperor. Although he does not appear externally, he has a lot of power internally. Runners are important positions in remittance shops, often held by assistant managers. They have to introduce new accounts like prostitutes receiving guests, flattering powerful industrialists and businessmen with folders and smiles, and trying to curry favor as much as possible. For those unlucky accounts, they tighten credit and frequently visit to check on their business, demanding payment with a stern face and refusing to make any concessions. Various worldly conditions are no less than those of prostitutes. However, the runner cannot be blamed because the manager gives him too much responsibility. If he is careless and incurs bad debts, he has to compensate. Of course, there are also many benefits to being a runner, such as becoming familiar with industrialists and businessmen and using loan funds to make extra money. It is also common for runners to be promoted to manager or assistant manager. Now, most remittance shops have changed from unlimited shareholders to limited joint-stock companies. This seems to be a big step forward on the surface, but the internal organization has not changed much. The powers of the manager and the runner are still so disproportionate. Talent-based cadre training is still out of the question. Therefore, although money industry staff have rich experience, their knowledge is often insufficient, and their vision is short-sighted. Without long-term plans, they cannot compete with banks in the modern commercial battlefield.
