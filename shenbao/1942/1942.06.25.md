### Vancouver Island: Losses Unknown

Lisbon, 23rd, Allied News Agency: Regarding the shelling of key points on Vancouver Island by Japanese submarines, Canadian authorities are keeping a tight lid on the matter, remaining silent about the extent of the damage. According to a United Press dispatch from Ottawa, the parliament has requested the government to disclose the truth. Canadian Minister of National Defence Ralston only made a brief announcement in the House of Commons on the 22nd. Newspaper reports were also very brief, staying within the scope of Ralston's announcement. According to a Reuters dispatch from Sepero, an American Indian who arrived there from 72 kilometers north witnessed the Japanese submarine shelling for quite some time, firing about 19 rounds. One round exploded near an important military facility. The lighthouse keeper nearby immediately reduced the intensity of the lighthouse fire to avoid being shelled by the Japanese submarine.

Madrid, 23rd, Allied News Agency: According to an Associated Press dispatch from Ottawa, Canadian Minister of National Defence Ralston announced in the House of Commons on the 22nd that a Japanese submarine shelled Vancouver Island on the night of the 20th, firing over 50 rounds at important military facilities from close range.

### Japanese Government to Control Major Food Products Starting July 1st

Tokyo, 24th, Allied News Agency: The Japanese Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry today promulgated regulations to be implemented from July 1st.

Products such as rice, wheat, other grains, sweet potatoes, pasta, buckwheat, and similar products will be controlled. The government will first purchase them at previously announced prices and then distribute them. Exports of rice and wheat to overseas ports and colonies will be entirely subject to government licensing.

According to news from New York, the rescued sailors have landed there. According to news from Washington, Secretary of State Hull, when meeting with newspaper reporters today, mentioned this incident, saying that since this attack was carried out in broad daylight, it is difficult to accept the German claim that they could not identify the nationality of the ship. After the incident, the German Chargé d'Affaires in Argentina visited the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and was received by the Undersecretary of Foreign Affairs, Jia Xu.

### American Cargo Ship Sunk

Washington, 23rd, Havas News Agency: The Navy Department announced that an American merchant ship was sunk by a German submarine on the 15th of this month in the Atlantic Ocean off the American coast.

Lisbon, 24th, Allied News Agency: British Minister of Information Bracken disclosed in the House of Commons today that the ship carrying the newly appointed British Information Counselor to the Soviet Union and his staff was sunk by a torpedo en route. When a member of Parliament inquired about Britain's adequate propaganda in the Soviet Union, he mentioned the above matter, stating that the Information Counselor and his staff had been rescued, but a large number of books and other propaganda materials had been lost. He also said that Britain is now shipping more films to the Soviet Union, and a British library will be established in Moscow, demonstrating Britain's intensified efforts to engage in propaganda in the Soviet Union.

### Chilean Ships Receive Guarantees from All Parties

Santiago, Chile, 23rd, Havas News Agency: Chilean Foreign Minister Falba notified the General Manager of the South American Steamship Company today that "our government has received guarantees from all parties that our ships flying the national flag will be respected in any waters."

### British House of Commons to Debate Military Situation

London, 23rd, Havas News Agency: It is learned that as soon as Prime Minister Churchill returns from Washington, he will report to the House of Commons on the setbacks suffered by British forces in Libya. Today, several members of Parliament spoke after Deputy Prime Minister Attlee made a speech, saying, "The House of Commons has obtained some information on the armament of our armored vehicle fleet. We should ask the Ministry of Defence and the War Office to pay attention." Sir Stafford Cripps, Leader of the House, then announced that the House of Commons would debate the general military situation. However, the government is finding it difficult to gather initial information. Prime Minister Churchill is currently in Washington, discussing important issues with the US authorities, and will return home soon.

Stockholm, Sweden, 24th, Huitong News Agency: According to a report from the London correspondent of a Swedish newspaper, when British Prime Minister Churchill returns from the United States, he will undoubtedly face an unprecedented serious political storm. Criticism of Churchill in the House of Commons has gradually become more unbridled. Judging from the news of the British defeat in Libya, the responsible generals and Churchill should be held accountable for strategic miscalculations. The British press is greatly disappointed by the defeat in Libya and no longer accepts the government's explanations and promises. They are now demanding a thorough investigation and punishment of those responsible. The Daily Forward states that Churchill, who also serves as Minister of Defence, cannot escape blame for the defeat in North Africa.

Stockholm, Sweden, 24th, Huitong News Agency: According to a London dispatch last night, it is generally believed that the House of Commons lacked confidence in the government's war policy before debating the disastrous defeat in Libya. Therefore, London political circles believe that during the House debate, attackers such as Greenwood, Baysharley Wintonton, and Milne will all support a vote of no confidence. If so, the British government will inevitably call for a vote of confidence.

### Attlee Reports on the War Situation

Lisbon, 23rd, Allied News Agency: According to a London dispatch, British Deputy Prime Minister Attlee delivered a report speech on the war situation in Libya and the Mediterranean when the House of Commons reconvened today. He briefly stated that during the initial German attack on Tobruk, the British tank forces suffered extremely heavy losses, and the British army lost its combat effectiveness. The detailed situation after the fall of Tobruk has not yet been reported, but the situation is quite serious. Recent battles in the Mediterranean have all been naval battles. Britain has lost one light cruiser, four destroyers, and two escort ships. Finally, Attlee stated that the House would be given the opportunity to discuss the war situation, and therefore asked them to wait two or three days until a detailed report was received. This can prove one aspect of the British government's predicament.

### Soviet Troops on the Kharkiv Line Retreat to New Positions: Fierce Fighting Continues in Key Black Sea Ports; Downtown Area Reduced to Rubble

Fuehrer's Headquarters, 24th, Huitong News Agency: This afternoon's German war bulletin stated that the enemy forces entrenched at the northern tip of Cape Khersones, north of Sevastopol, have been annihilated. The German-Romanian allied forces in the eastern sector penetrated deep into the heavily fortified enemy positions hidden in the forests. German aircraft concentrated on bombing the enemy infantry and artillery defense zones. From June 7th to the 22nd, in the battle of Sevastopol, 11,000 enemy soldiers were captured, 158 artillery pieces were seized, 2,014 enemy bunkers were captured, and 65,254 landmines were cleared. The operation to clear enemy forces in the central eastern sector is progressing smoothly. Although several units of Soviet troops have been wiped out, the enemy forces trapped in Volkhov, despite occupying advantageous terrain, cannot withstand the pressure of the German army, which is closing in tighter and tighter, and their situation is becoming increasingly desperate. Repeated attempts by the enemy to rescue them have been ineffective. A squadron of German light fighter-bombers sank a Soviet motor torpedo boat in Finland. Our aircraft shot down 11 enemy aircraft in Murmansk.

Moscow, 23rd, Havas News Agency: The General Headquarters of the Red Army announced in a war bulletin: "Today, German forces continued to attack along the Kharkiv line. Our troops were forced to retreat to new positions. In the Sevastopol port area, German forces launched repeated fierce attacks, with numbers far exceeding those of the Red Army, but as a result, they were still repelled by our forces. There have been no major changes in other war zones."

Berlin, 24th, Huitong News Agency: According to the German High Command, the Soviet troops on the Uzhov front have been repelled. The German counterattack has made considerable progress, capturing hundreds of Soviet troops and destroying six Soviet tanks. German aircraft also bombed Soviet vehicle convoys. Twelve Soviet aircraft were shot down, with no losses for German aircraft.

Berlin, 24th, Havas News Agency: The High Command announced that the Red Army resistance forces at the northern end of Sevastopol Bay in the Sevastopol region have now been cleared. From the 7th to the 21st of this month, 11,100 Red Army soldiers in the area were captured, and 158 field artillery pieces were abandoned.

Stockholm, Sweden, 24th, Havas News Agency: A German announcement states that the remaining Red Army troops in the northern part of the port of Sevastopol have been eliminated. German land and air forces are now jointly attacking other parts of the port. Fierce fighting is taking place in rugged terrain. Several more Red Army fortifications have been occupied by the German army. Although the situation is serious, the Red Army has not given up all hope of saving the situation and has launched several counterattacks. The downtown area of the port has been reduced to rubble under the bombing of German and Italian aircraft. Most of the residents have been evacuated. According to officers returning from the front, the Soviet Navy can relieve the siege of Sevastopol. At present, no Soviet warships have been sunk in the area.

Moscow, 24th, Havas News Agency: Pravda reported today that the Soviet authorities in Sevastopol have begun evacuating women and children throughout the city to the Caucasus. However, the soldiers and able-bodied men defending the fortress are still fighting bravely and have even blocked several points where the German army has broken through the defense line.

Ukraine, 24th, Havas News Agency: Military observers here say that after the "mopping-up operations" in the Leningrad area and the Donets Basin are completed and the remaining Red Army troops and guerrillas in these areas are cleared, the German army will launch a large-scale offensive against the Soviet Union. Looking back on the situation since the outbreak of the German-Soviet war a year ago, the German army is far superior to the Red Army in terms of weapons, strategy, and command. The German army's continuous victories are due to this. However, the Red Army has abundant weaponry to sustain the war and high morale. In general, the first year of the war can be divided into three phases: the first phase, the six months after the start of the war, was the period of the German army's blitzkrieg advance; the second phase was the winter truce period, during which the Red Army launched offensives in several locations; and the third phase was the period of spring offensives, during which the German army achieved strategic successes.

### Vice Admiral Kirk Hahan Arrives in the US

Lisbon, 24th, Huitong News Agency: According to today's news, Vice Admiral Kirk Hahan, who led the British Admiralty delegation to the United States, arrived in New York last night and immediately went to Washington. A reporter asked him to express his thoughts after the fall of Tobruk, but he declined.

### Soviet Union Announces One-Year Losses

Lisbon, 23rd, Allied News Agency: According to news from Moscow, the German-Soviet war has lasted for a full year. The Soviet government issued a statement today on the losses within one year, stating that the Red Army suffered 4.5 million dead, wounded, or captured, lost 22,000 artillery pieces, 15,000 tanks, and 9,000 aircraft. As for this year's spring offensive, the German authorities were still able to concentrate a large number of soldiers, tanks, and aircraft in some areas and achieve considerable victories, such as the battle in the Kerch Peninsula. In the near future, such victories are not impossible in other areas.

### Communications Between Sweden and Berlin Interrupted

Stockholm, Sweden, 24th, Havas News Agency: Telegraphic communication between Berlin and Sweden was interrupted again last night. The reason is unknown.

Stockholm, Sweden, 24th, Huitong News Agency: According to a report in a local newspaper yesterday, when the Swedish National Socialist Party held a meeting in Trelleborg on Monday, the chairman and his guards were attacked. However, after the chairman and other personnel were taken to a safe place, the disturbance did not stop. Several demonstrators were arrested. The crowd demanded their release from the police station. The police station was unable to resist and finally granted their request. The members of the National Socialist Party were only escorted home by police officers in the evening.

### Malta's Situation Becomes More Dangerous

Rome, 23rd, Havas News Agency: Newspapers recently reported that after the fall of the British fortress port of Tobruk in Libya, the situation on the British naval base of Malta in the Mediterranean became more dangerous. The Axis authorities will use the islands of Dodecanese, bases along the Greek coast, Tobruk, and Crete to intensify the encirclement of Malta. The island's supply sources are insufficient, and it will eventually become "anemic." However, Malta is not the next target of the Axis attack, as the Axis authorities have enough power to constantly increase the threat to Palestine and Alexandria. The gains and losses of Malta are of no great importance. At the same time, Gada wrote an article in the Italian newspaper Il Popolo d'Italia today, stating that the British blamed the loss of the port of Tobruk on a lack of military equipment and preparation, which is not true. Forty-five thousand British troops were captured, sixty thousand were killed or wounded, and a large number of troops retreated to the Egyptian border, which shows the size of their army. As for military equipment, especially tanks, it was very abundant. Our army destroyed 1,000 of their tanks and 500 aircraft. The British also had a large number of arsenals, ammunition depots, and oil depots, all protected by underground cables. The Maosafangte Railway runs directly to near the port of Tobruk, making military transportation extremely convenient. It can be seen that the British had advantages everywhere, and their defeat was due to poor combat performance.

### Salazar to Give Broadcast Speech Tonight: Portuguese Troops Continue to Depart for Overseas

### Canada to Order Conscription for Overseas Service

Ottawa, 23rd, Havas News Agency: The Minister of the Navy declared in Parliament today that Canada will order conscription for overseas service, and this matter may come suddenly. Members of Parliament, please pay attention. According to government officials, the authorities have been debated for a week on this very issue, and have concluded that conscription for overseas service, may not be necessary.

### Pan-American Conference to Convene at the End of the Month

Buenos Aires, Argentina, 23rd, Allied News Agency: The United States has scheduled a Pan-American Conference to be held in Washington on the 30th, which is expected to focus on reviewing the financial and economic control organizations of the Americas in order to recover the recent political and military losses of the United States. The aim is to bring Argentina and Chile, which are maintaining neutrality, into the US camp in order to strengthen the position of the Americas. According to observers here, the following four matters will be discussed at that time: Blocking the farms owned by Axis nationals and transferring them to state management; Managing the confiscated foreign assets and various facilities; Appointing a foreign property administrator; Auctioning off confiscated property. It is reported that Argentina also intends to send representatives to attend. It is generally believed that since Argentina is now adopting a centralist policy, even if other countries advocate taking measures to suppress the Axis powers at the meeting, Argentina will reject them.

### Public Horse-Drawn Carriages in Chongqing

According to a letter received from Chongqing through private channels, the Public Carriage Transportation Service of Chongqing, undertaken by the Yiyun Management Office of the Ministry of Communications, officially opened for traffic from Shangqingsi to Hualongqiao on April 1st of this year. The fare for the entire route is 2.5 yuan per person, with five people per carriage, which is four-tenths cheaper than a rickshaw (rickshaws cost 4 yuan). The speed is also faster than a rickshaw. The carriage drivers and horses have been trained by the Yiyun Management Office. There are currently 50 carriages, each costing 14,000 yuan. Each carriage is equipped with two horses, which are driven in shifts. Each carriage can travel six round trips, or twelve trips, per day. Most of the horses are owned by the carriage drivers. The Yiyun Management Office extracts four-tenths of the fare, while the drivers take six-tenths. Each carriage earns 12.5 yuan per trip, totaling 150 yuan for twelve trips. The drivers can actually earn 90 yuan per day. The cost of feed for each horse is about 30 yuan per day. The drivers' meals can be included at the Yiyun Management Office for 75 yuan per month.

### Germany Continues to Transfer Large Forces, Preparing to Attack Capuzzo; Italy Claims Fierce Fighting on the Egyptian Border

Bern, Switzerland, 24th, Allied News Agency: According to last night's latest news, General Rommel, commander-in-chief of the German forces in North Africa, is still transferring a large number of tanks and motorized infantry to the Egyptian border in order to concentrate his main force and attack the Capuzzo fortress. This fortress is the center of the British Eighth Army's new defense line. Other units under General Rommel have already moved to the south, attempting to capture Sidi Barrani. A large number of tanks and motorized infantry have also been seen hurrying east along the Bardia road from the Tobruk area, which was occupied last week, and have already crossed the Gambut area, which is about twenty miles from the Egyptian border. At dawn on Tuesday, the army was accelerating its advance towards the main force. It is reported that the German army will launch a full-scale attack as soon as the deployment is complete. Last night, the German artillery had already made contact with the British vanguard troops in order to test the strength of the British defense line.

Rome, 24th, Huitong News Agency: The Italian military headquarters announced this afternoon that our vanguard is advancing along the Libyan-Egyptian border and is engaged in fierce fighting. The number of enemy soldiers captured in the Battle of Tobruk has reached 33,000. Our fighter squadrons engaged enemy aircraft over Pantelleria and shot down three enemy aircraft. We suffered no losses. Our fighter planes, protecting the bombers, shot down eight Spitfire British planes during attacks on the Lavinia airfield and the Luqa airfield in Malta. One Italian plane did not return to base.

Somewhere on the Libyan Border, 23rd, Havas News Agency: General Rommel, commander of the German forces in North Africa, captured Tobruk with a blitzkrieg tactic, annihilating the British Eighth Army in one fell swoop, completing a brilliant feat in the history of desert warfare. The Libyan war situation has thus been largely settled. There are no major military developments on the front line today, but general military observers believe that Rommel's next goal will be to launch a large-scale offensive against the new British defense line. Various signs now prove that this speculation is not unfounded, especially the rumor that a large number of German paratroopers have concentrated on Crete. At the same time, it is widely rumored that Axis patrols have expanded their range of activities to Fort Capuzzo. However, it is still impossible to determine whether this strategically important point is still in British hands or whether the British have had to abandon it. This fortress is located outside the new British defense line, which is slightly inclined towards Egyptian territory, beyond the reach of British forces. The British are now using Sollum, Halfaya Pass, El Adem, and Fort Maddalena as their defensive centers. According to the latest news, a large number of Axis troops have concentrated in the Sollum and Halfaya areas, but this does not mean that they will immediately attack the area, because General Rommel's troops are quick-moving and unpredictable, and can, within a few hours, change their target and attack El Adem or other British strongholds, or even launch a joint Axis attack on all points simultaneously.

The Egyptian Cabinet Convenes to Discuss the Grave Situation

Istanbul, 24th, Huitong News Agency: Cairo believes that the convening of the Egyptian cabinet meeting yesterday indicates that the Egyptian government has recognized that the situation has entered a state of severe military urgency. It is reported that British military and diplomatic officials also attended the cabinet meeting, which proves that this statement is not wrong. Cairo Radio confirmed that the discussion at the meeting focused on the fall of Tobruk and the annihilation of the British Eighth Army. Other reports from Cairo state that anti-British demonstrations have taken place in Cairo, Alexandria, and several other Egyptian cities after the British defeat. Egyptian military police have been on alert all day. It is reported that some Egyptian youths have clashed with British soldiers. The British authorities are said to have notified Egyptian Prime Minister Nahas that if the Egyptian authorities are unable to suppress the unrest, British troops will provide assistance. A British military vehicle derailed between Alexandria and Mersa Matruh, killing ten British soldiers and injuring many others. The authorities are investigating the cause of the accident. Military trains have been arriving at Cairo station in a continuous stream in recent days, carrying countless wounded soldiers.

Stockholm, Sweden, 24th, Huitong News Agency: A Cairo dispatch states that Egyptian Prime Minister Nahas met with British Ambassador Lampson and Lieutenant General Stone, commander-in-chief of the British forces in Egypt, yesterday for two hours.

Istanbul, 24th, Huitong News Agency: According to news received here last night, the British Ninth Army, stationed in Palestine and Syria, is now concentrated near Haifa. Well-informed sources believe that part of it will be sent to Egypt.

### Important White House Meeting Discusses Shipping Issues; Naval and Shipping Officials Attend; Roosevelt and Churchill Meet with T.V. Soong

Buenos Aires, Argentina, 24th, Allied News Agency: According to a Washington dispatch, U.S. President Roosevelt and British Prime Minister Churchill met with British and American shipping magnates at 11:30 a.m. yesterday to discuss how to deal with the losses of Allied ships caused by Axis submarines. Participants included U.S. Chief of Naval Operations Admiral King, U.S. Navy Department Bureau of Navigation Chief Vice Admiral Robinson, Wartime Shipping Administrator Admiral Land, Deputy Administrator Douglas, U.S. Maritime Commission Chairman Rear Admiral Vickery, British Minister of Shipping Sir Salter, British and American Chiefs of Staff General Liddell, British Admiralty Representative Rear Admiral Dalling, and Lend-Lease Administrator Harriman.

Lisbon, 24th, Allied News Agency: According to a Washington dispatch, U.S. President Roosevelt and British Prime Minister Churchill discussed matters overnight yesterday and have not stopped all day today. The President's regular meeting with news reporters today was also cancelled. The major issues discussed were shipbuilding and ship utilization.

Buenos Aires, Argentina, 24th, Allied News Agency: According to a Washington dispatch, the White House recently disclosed that U.S. President Roosevelt and British Prime Minister Churchill met with Chongqing Foreign Minister T.V. Soong for a long time on Monday. The President's Secretary O'Reilly said that they were, of course, discussing China in a military sense. It is said that a more detailed statement about this meeting will not be issued until the conference is over.

Washington, 24th, Havas News Agency: The secrets of the talks between President Roosevelt and British Prime Minister Churchill are now gradually being revealed. It has been proven that the meeting took place at the White House and that the discussions covered a wide range of political, diplomatic, economic, military, and naval affairs. The goal is to formulate a common plan. The most important issue to be resolved is naval transportation. How to increase the number of ships built, how to utilize existing ships, and how to reduce the losses inflicted on Allied ships by submarines will be the focus of the discussion. Roosevelt and Churchill are said to have both advocated concentrating all efforts on dealing with Germany first. However, the defeat of the British forces in Libya has raised another question: whether to strengthen the African front or temporarily abandon the plan to open a second front in Europe. It is not yet known how Roosevelt and Churchill will decide on this issue. If the decision is consistent with the unanimous opinion of the military authorities, then the second front will be opened as soon as possible, even if it increases the risk of losing Egypt.

### Rumors of a Five-Pronged Plan Devised by Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union; "Berliner Börsen-Zeitung" Comments, Believing Portugal and Spain Will Be Invaded

Berlin, 24th, Huitong News Agency: Regarding the plan "Five Ways Britain Can Help the Soviet War Effort" published in London's "Daily Express," the "Berliner Börsen-Zeitung" commented that British-Soviet military talks seem to have discussed the possibility of Britain invading Portugal and Spain, as well as British, American, and Soviet forces entering Turkey. The map of British-Soviet war strategy published in the London newspaper has five arrows, indicating the direction of the British-Soviet offensive: one along the Norwegian coast to near Murmansk, the second across the northwestern border of Germany to near Hamburg, the third across the western border of Germany to near Berlin and southwestern Germany, the fourth invading Portugal and Spain, and the fifth advancing from the Suez Canal in two directions, east and west, across Turkey to the Balkan countries. The fourth plan is an act of aggression, and Britain will undoubtedly use its secret agents to operate in the target areas. The fifth plan, to cross Turkey, proves that Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union are unwilling to respect Turkey's neutrality.

Stockholm, Sweden, 24th, Huitong News Agency: According to the latest news from London, Roosevelt and Churchill issued a statement simultaneously in London and Washington yesterday morning, promising to gather the strongest forces of Britain, the United States, and China in the shortest possible time against one Axis country. Due to the ambiguity of its meaning, it caused disappointment in London. Political circles in London paid close attention to this statement, even believing that although the British army suffered a defeat in Libya, the issue of establishing a second front will soon be realized. The tone of the speech delivered by Hopkins, Chairman of the Allied War Supplies Committee, on Monday evening was so firm, unless Hopkins had obtained information about this important decision. London's morning newspapers, led by the "Daily Express," are calling for a second front to be reopened due to the defeat in Libya. According to news from Washington, Soviet Ambassador to the United States Litvinov reiterated the demand for a second front on Monday evening. The "News Chronicle" also demanded that a completely defensive posture be adopted in the Near East, and that troops and war materials should no longer be transported to the Near East. The ships that we can use today should be used in the way that is most advantageous and quickest to achieve victory, and the establishment of a second front is the time for this.

Secret Clauses of the Anglo-Soviet Agreement

Stockholm, Sweden, 24th, Huitong News Agency: The Gothenburg Morning Post revealed yesterday morning the secret clauses regarding neutrality in the Anglo-Soviet agreement. This discovery is said to be based on information obtained from a diplomat close to representatives of an Allied country. The important secret clauses are as follows: The Soviet Union's territorial demands on Finland, the Baltic States, Poland, and Romania are recognized in principle. A special agreement will be concluded regarding Iran. Most areas bordering or adjacent to the Soviet Union, including Finland, northern Scandinavia, Czechoslovakia, Romania, Bulgaria, and Yugoslavia, are recognized as being within the Soviet Union's sphere of influence. In order to protect against future attacks by Axis countries, the Soviet Union may, under the Lend-Lease Agreement, obtain bases and the right to station troops. With the consent of Britain, the Soviet Union may exercise military and political administration in Finland, Germany, Hungary, Romania, and Bulgaria. This clause is fully consistent with Clause 3 of the Anglo-Soviet Agreement, which stipulates that the Allied countries may take all possible preventive measures to prevent future attacks. The two contracting parties pledge to completely eliminate the national socialist regime, the fascist regime, and similar political systems in Europe. The newspaper added that the source of this information, based on past facts, has proven to be very reliable, so it does not hesitate to publish it, although this may cause shock in Sweden and elsewhere.

Berlin, 23rd, Central News Agency: A spokesman for the German Foreign Ministry said today that we have no unexpected special feelings about the Anglo-Soviet secret agreement. We are only surprised by the extent to which Britain is willing to make concessions to the Soviet Union in various clauses. This move by Britain not only shows Britain's stupidity, but Britain is actually a major criminal in transferring Europe to the Soviet Union. We will respond to this with force and seek final victory.

### After the Implementation of Grain Rationing, Other Rice Transactions are Prohibited; The French Concession Announces the Areas for Obtaining Permits Tomorrow

The two concessions have set July 6 as the date for the implementation of grain rationing. Starting from the 22nd, rice purchase permits will be issued as the first step in implementing grain rationing. There are ten issuing locations in the Public Concession and six in the French Concession. Permits will be issued continuously for twelve days, divided into six groups, with each group issuing for two days, ending on July 4. July 5 (Sunday) is the preparation period, and grain rationing will be implemented from the 6th. After the implementation of grain rationing, rice shops in the Public Concession, in addition to providing rice to registered households with rice purchase permits, will not be allowed to engage in any other rice transactions. However, the transportation and sale of other miscellaneous grains and flour products will still be allowed and will not be subject to the restrictions of grain rationing. Larger factories in the concessions may still apply directly to the Shanghai Municipal Council's Rice and Grain Office for purchasing rice. According to general observations, the food consumption of workers in factories is certainly greater than that of ordinary households, and the rice ration will be insufficient. According to reports, yesterday the Central District of the Public Concession issued a total of 19,022 rice purchase permits (825 households), the First Branch of the Western District issued 15,855 (773 households), the Second Branch issued 13,818, and the First Branch of the Eastern District issued 1,712. Other districts also issued fewer permits than the Central District, so when obtaining permits in the near future, the Central District is expected to be the most crowded.

French Concession Issues Further Notices

Regarding the issuance of rice purchase permits, the French Concession authorities continue to issue notices. All landlords or heads of households in the following sections are requested to go to the police station in their jurisdiction to collect rice purchase permits starting at 8:00 a.m. on the 26th of this month (Friday):

Nanshi Districts Continue to Issue Rice Permits

The Municipal Food Administration has decided that starting on July 1, all grain ration rice purchase permits, in addition to being distributed in advance in the first district of Nanshi, will be distributed simultaneously in the second, third, fourth, and fifth districts starting at 1:00 p.m. today (25th) at the public locations designated by the Food Bureau within each district for rice purchase registration and the issuance of grain ration rice purchase permits. Yesterday morning, the Food Bureau specially convened the headmen of each district to distribute the printed notices to the headmen of each district for distribution to each household, one per household, and instructed on the steps and intentions of promoting grain rationing. After receiving this notice, the head of each household must promptly go to the designated public location for registration within two days and must bring the head of household's seal to be affixed to the registration book when receiving the grain ration rice purchase permit. Each permit requires the collection of a deposit of two jiao for the cost of printing the paper, which must not be increased. At the same time, the Food Bureau will send personnel to the public locations to supervise the registration work, with senior officials of the bureau ordered to inspect in person to prevent abuses and ensure thoroughness. As for the western part of Shanghai, preparations for the necessary work have also begun. The Bureau specially requested the Western District Police Department to borrow the household registration cards of the district for filling out grain ration rice purchase permits. The Western District Police Department has now replied, agreeing to the loan. Therefore, grain rationing in the Western District will be implemented after Nanshi in a short period of time.

### Sheng Yudu Discusses Shanghai's Living Conditions

Mr. Sheng Yudu, consultant to the Shanghai Municipal Council and Deputy Director-General, holding a vital and important position, discussed the wartime living conditions in Shanghai with visitors yesterday, offering insightful views. These are recorded as follows:

Shanghai's Situation

The Shanghai concessions have repeatedly escaped the threats of war and avoided the devastation of artillery fire. Citizens still enjoy various luxurious lifestyles, as if living in a paradise. With the outbreak of the Pacific War, Shanghai has also been drawn into the vortex. Changes in the environment are already a reality, but there are still many people in Shanghai who hope to continue their leisurely lives as before, which is a mistake.

Living Conditions in Various Countries

Looking at the residents of London, England, they hardly have the opportunity to eat fresh fruit in a year, and all food is rationed to the minimum extent and distributed to the people. Compared to the residents of this city, who can still eat tropical fruits and seafood from various places, what a difference! Although the United States has only recently joined the war, the lives of its people and the sale of goods have already been severely restricted. For example, only a small spoonful of sugar is allowed in a cup of coffee, which is indicative of the situation. The Japanese are usually very particular about eating rice, but now their residents also eat sorghum. Their spirit of enduring hardship and sacrifice is evident. The living conditions of German and Soviet residents are even more difficult, but they are all able to persevere and endure hardship, each with the interests of their country in mind.

Current Measures

The authorities in this city have now decided to implement a household food supply system. This is a necessary step for fair distribution during extraordinary times. We must distribute rice and grain equally to all citizens according to the source of supply, in order to achieve the goal of everyone having food to eat. This facility is an emergency measure during extraordinary times. The administrative authorities originally intended to use this to maintain the people's food supply for a long time, but citizens must not regard this as a guarantee of enjoyment. In the shadow of war, what enjoyment can we have? What we can hope for is only to maintain a minimum standard of living. Therefore, the household food supply system will become the standard of our lives and is only a preliminary test of our wartime lives. We should not take it lightly.

Sincere Cooperation

Furthermore, society is a common society of the people, not a society of a few. Therefore, the safety of society depends entirely on the support and efforts of the people. As the saying goes, "It is up to people to make things happen." If we want to ensure the safety of Shanghai, then all citizens must cooperate sincerely and unite to defend it. Only in this way can we overcome the difficulties of the environment and achieve good results.

Grasping Beliefs

Moreover, misunderstandings and incidents are inevitable in any environment. For example, the rumor about the [missing] Russian [soldiers] last week caused a great commotion in the city. Such instances should be reported truthfully to the competent authorities for investigation and handling. It is useless to cause alarm or spread rumors. In short, from now on, citizens should embrace a spirit of cooperation and abandon their past selfishness, be down-to-earth, and cope with the future environment. They must not be overly concerned with personal interests and must always prioritize the greater good over the individual. Everyone must grasp the belief of sharing blessings and enduring hardships together. Only in this way can we obtain the common and peaceful life that we can possibly have, and at the same time, increase our sense of excitement.

### Public Works Department Urges Payment for Flour Warehouse Receipts

The Public Works Department recently issued Notice No. 555, stating: Regarding the Bureau's purchase of flour, it was previously announced in Notice No. 5765 on January 31st of this year. All companies, firms, groups, and individuals who have flour stored within the concession but have not yet submitted the warehouse receipts and other documents to the Bureau should submit the warehouse receipts and other documents to the Flour Office at Office No. 801 of the Bureau for verification and collection before the 30th of this month.

### Gokusei Brand Deer Antler & Ginseng Cibaoming is a Giant in Hormone Preparations

Human health is greatly related to hormones. The human body has more than a dozen endocrine glands that constantly secrete various hormones to stimulate all physiological functions. Among them, pituitary hormones are particularly important, acting as a leader. Throughout the entire life process, hormone secretion cannot be evenly consistent. Sometimes, due to a lack of hormones, certain physiological malfunctions occur, such as sexual neurasthenia and summer fatigue, all of which are caused by a lack of hormones. Modern medicine uses hormone preparations to treat these diseases. Shanghai Gokusei Pharmaceutical Factory was founded by pharmacist He Zikang, former general manager of Xinyi Pharmaceutical Factory, who is an expert in hormone preparations. Mr. He successfully researched and developed endocrine hormone preparations more than ten years ago. Gokusei brand Deer Antler & Ginseng Cibaoming is produced under Mr. He's supervision. This is a comprehensive hormone preparation that has the effect of nourishing the body and replenishing vitality. It is unanimously adopted by famous doctors throughout Shanghai. Its reputation has already been established. This preparation is gentle, neither drying nor heating, and suitable for all seasons. As the hot season approaches, sales of this product are very strong. It is said that many families are taking it as a good medicine to prevent summer fatigue. Gokusei brand Deer Antler & Ginseng Cibaoming is sold in major companies and pharmacies. The main factory is located on Avenue Petain in the French Concession. The factory also employs famous doctors. If patients have any questions, they can consult them for satisfactory answers.

### Japanese Authorities Assist in Suppressing Old Currency: Xingya Yuan Announces Details of Prohibition

According to the Domei News Agency, the use of old legal tender will be completely prohibited in Shanghai and Nanjing from the 25th. The Japanese authorities in this city have decided to unanimously assist in the suppression. Regarding this point, the Huazhong Liaison Department of the Xingya Yuan issued a statement yesterday (24th), specifying the scope of the prohibition of old currency use: "The task of suppressing the use of old currency will be carried out by the Shanghai Municipal Government, the Public Works Department, the French Concession Board of Directors, and the police stations of the Japanese Consulate General. The Shanghai Port Affairs Department of the Japanese Marines and the Military Police will assist from the side. It is hoped that citizens will pay attention and absolutely no longer use old currency." The details of the prohibition of using old currency are listed as follows: -Using it when buying and selling goods. -Using it to pay for hotel and apartment rent and barbershop fees, etc. -Using it to repay debts. -Exchanging it for other currencies (i.e., using it for exchange). -Using it for deposits (including deposits in financial institutions). -Using it as collateral. -Interest-bearing loans. -Non-interest-bearing loans. -Gifts. The above behaviors are considered users by both parties involved in the transfer. Carrying and transporting it for use is also considered using it. However, simply storing old currency yourself or entrusting it to a place other than a financial institution for safekeeping is not considered using it. Public Works Department recently issued Notice No. 5956, stipulating that from June 25th of this year, the use of old legal tender will be prohibited in the Public Concession. From the same date, banknotes issued by the Central Reserve Bank will be the legal tender. Old currency of 50 cents and below issued by the Central Bank, the Bank of Communications, or the Bank of China will be temporarily allowed to be used at a ratio of two yuan of old currency equal to one yuan of Central Reserve Bank currency until further notice. Anyone or company that violates the above regulations will be prosecuted by the Bureau in accordance with the law.

Small Tax Collection Order Suspended

According to reports, after the period for the Old Currency Consolidation Committee to collect and exchange old currency expired on the 21st, in order to show consideration for the merchants and people of Shanghai, the four temporary exchange offices in Zhabei, West Shanghai, Meyers Road, and Nanshi continued to handle the exchange of small amounts of old currency on the 22nd. Now, because the Ministry of Finance has announced that the use of small currency exchange is suspended in the special city districts and Shanghai (limited to the old city of Shanghai and the two special districts).

### Authorities Approve Fresh Milk Price Increase

The Information Office of the Public Works Department announced that the authorities of the Public Concession, the French Concession, and the West Shanghai three municipal districts have jointly issued a notice to citizens, published in today's newspapers, regarding the revision of fresh milk prices. From October of last year to April of this year, the milk companies did not increase milk prices. In April of this year, the Bureau issued Notice No. 5864, allowing a 40% increase in milk prices, with A (TT) and Grade A milk not exceeding 2 yuan and 15 cents per pint, and Grade B milk not exceeding 1 yuan and 85 cents per pint. Now, A (TT) and Grade A milk are allowed to increase in price by 45 cents per pint, and Grade B milk is allowed to increase in price by 35 cents per pint. Since April, the price of feed has continued to rise, but milk prices did not increase between April and June. Therefore, the current price increase is justifiable. Before approving the price increase, the authorities conducted a detailed investigation of production costs, ordering each milk company to submit a form detailing production costs for review. At present, the currency system has become stable, and the authorities have taken joint measures to prevent price increases. Therefore, further increases in milk prices are expected to be avoided.

### Asama Maru Temporarily Stays in Yokohama

The English-language "China Press" reported that the "Conte Verde," which was transporting American expatriates, was originally scheduled to depart from Shanghai this morning (24th), but was suddenly postponed. The exact date of departure of the ship is not yet known. It is only known that its departure date will be within a few days. The American expatriates waiting for repatriation have no choice but to continue to reside in places such as the Columbia Country Club and the American School.

### Speculative Firms Illegally Install Telephones: Police Conduct Strict Investigation, Several Arrests and Interrogations

The "Shanghai Times" reported that yesterday (23rd), it was learned that 20 brokers and others from more than a dozen Chinese firms in the central district had illegally installed telephone lines without prior permission from the authorities or notification to the Shanghai Telephone Company. As a result, they were questioned by detectives from the Central Police on Monday evening. No arrests were made at the time, but it is expected that there will be significant developments in this matter. The illegally installed telephone lines stretched from Sichuan Road to Ningbo Road and other prominent locations in the central district, such as Henan Road, Jiangxi Road, and Ningbo Road, where black market merchants abound. It is said that those questioned were mostly engaged in speculative activities. Because they wanted to be the first to know about black market fluctuations, they installed secret telephone lines between their offices and cotton yarn trading houses. The matter was discovered by the Police Department, which dispatched personnel to investigate offices suspected of illegally installing telephone lines. The results of the investigation are currently being kept secret, and it is not yet certain whether those questioned have confessed to illegally installing telephone lines. According to reliable sources, private offices and black market firms can know the latest developments in the market without delay by privately installing direct telephone lines. It is said that when making calls on illegally installed telephone lines, there is no need to wait for the ringing sound. Simply pick up the receiver and you can talk directly to the other party.

### Shen Heting and His Miniature Electric Car

The miniature electric car was designed and built by expert Shen Heting. It is similar in shape to a small Austin, but its effectiveness and speed are far superior to that of a pedal car. The car runs on electricity stored in a battery. Its speed is 15 miles per hour. It is painted with lacquer, making it shiny and eye-catching. It has a windshield, retractable top, rearview mirror, horn, and headlights. The front and rear are equipped with chrome bumpers made of spring steel, making them extremely strong. The internal device is ten times simpler than a car, making it very easy to drive, but it has all the advantages of a car. It can be operated easily with reverse, fast, medium fast, and slow speeds. The rear wheels are equipped with Lanling brakes, which are no different from those of a car. Starting and stopping are very agile. The car has four wheels, with a spare tire. Each wheel can be easily removed and replaced. The passenger compartment has a sofa cushion that can accommodate two people. When the back seat is folded out, it can seat one to three children. The car weighs only 700 pounds. According to Mr. Shen, the average daily electricity consumption is about 3 degrees, which can travel 20 to 30 miles. Even if it consumes 90 degrees of electricity per month, it is still within the electricity company's electricity consumption limit. The low electricity consumption is truly surprising. If a family has this, only the electricity saved from the lights is enough to power the car. The charging method is also very simple. Just plug the power cord into the charger at night and let the electricity flow in. In the morning, the machine is fully charged and can be driven again.

### Public Bond Advances Outweigh Declines: Market Gradually Rises

The over-the-counter market for public bonds continued to rise yesterday. Sellers were scarce, while buyers appeared eager. Market sentiment gradually leaned bullish, with large long positions becoming increasingly strong. The number of sellers gradually decreased, not as robust as in the past. As the buying side was led by financial institutions, their momentum was stronger, and short sellers temporarily retreated. The market gradually rose. The buying was led by Tongkang on behalf of the financial sector, with Tongshengxin, Tongyuan, Hu Heji, Shuntai, Runde, and Yongchang also participating in the absorption. Although Tongli released some spot goods, the quantity was not significant. Dazhong and Dalai closed out long positions, and Lianhe and Lian also sold off some holdings. As a result of the competition, demand still exceeded supply, and the market price continued to rise, calling for an increase of seventy cents. The transaction volume was approximately 2.8 to 2.9 million yuan. A concise table is listed below:

### Foreign Stock Market Stable: Trading Volume Higher Than Previous Day

Yesterday's foreign stock market was mediocre, but the trading volume was higher than in previous days. China Textile traded at 39 yuan, with sellers emerging only at 40 yuan. Ewo Cotton Mill was also low at 43.5 yuan. Sino-British Cotton Mill was at 37 yuan, with demand still exceeding supply. Shanghai Waterworks was quoted at 22 yuan. Jardine Brewery and Shanghai Paper were both priced at 13.5 yuan, with sellers present. Shanghai Dockyard was at 38 yuan, with sellers present. Steel was at 17 yuan, and Xiangtai was at 29 yuan, with buyers present.

### Chinese Stock Trading Not Quiet

Yesterday, Chinese stocks were slightly weak, but the trading volume was not quiet. The specific prices of various small stocks are listed below by category:

### Money Market Interbank Lending Rate Unchanged

The interbank lending rate announced by the Money Trade Association was 1.8 cents, with new "hua tou ban" (likely a term for a type of loan) at half the rate. Japanese military scrip was at 5.5 yuan and 5.55 yuan, similar to the previous day.

Low prices encourage hoarding; cotton cloth falls first, then rebounds; coarse cloth buyers are few; prices are still slightly 3-5 yuan.

Factory cloth prices fell first and then rose yesterday, and the situation has stabilized. When trading opened in the morning, prices plummeted due to the sharp drop in Dong疋 (a type of cloth), and the market was very soft. Afterwards, prices gradually rebounded. Fine cloth and "ten forest cloth" (likely a type of cloth) did not fluctuate significantly compared to the previous day. Coarse cloth saw few buyers. "Dian pi" (likely a type of cloth) continued to fall by three to five yuan, with sixteen-pound "Earth" coarse cloth hitting a low of 185 yuan, closing at 190 yuan in the evening. "Flying Goose" was at 185 yuan, nine-pound "New Character" at 115 yuan, eight "Zhenzhong" at 112 yuan, and twelve-pound "Earth" fine cloth opened at a low of 164 yuan, later rising to 167.5 yuan. "Fugui New Single" was at 165 yuan, "Dapeng" at 155 yuan, and "Peach Blossom Lady's Forest" fell slightly to 268 yuan before rebounding, reaching as high as 278 yuan in the afternoon, closing at 276.5 yuan. The declining trend has stabilized, showing signs of a turnaround.

Dongbu (a type of cloth) prices fell sharply in the morning due to market fears, but then quickly rose due to purchases by market participants and outside speculators, boosting market sentiment. Twelve-pound "Dragon Head" fine cloth "New Single" opened at 187 yuan and gradually rose to 196 yuan, unchanged from the previous day. "Bank Single" was at 167 yuan, "Colored Ball" at 171 yuan, "Flying Fish" at 168 yuan, "Yang He" at 165 yuan, and "Laba" at 16 [yuan]. "Four Gentlemen" red flannel hit a new low of 7.05 yuan, but buyers quickly emerged, and prices rebounded to 7.4 yuan by midday, still down 5 cents from the day before yesterday. However, market sentiment has stabilized.

### Very Little Wool and Worsted Released

Wool and worsted have become increasingly scarce recently, as hoarders have been keeping them for a long time, and merchants are taking advantage of the scarcity. There has been no new supply, and very little has been circulating, except for some releases from Japanese manufacturers. Autumn wool and winter overcoat wool are particularly expensive. Yesterday, "Gongda" overcoat wool sold for 280 yuan, "Yongxing" overcoat wool for 200 yuan, "Meifeng" overcoat wool for 400 yuan, "10,000" yuan "zhigong" wool for 260 yuan, "456" light flannel for 100 yuan, "129" "yu sha" wool for 135 yuan, "135" flannel for 180 yuan, and "250" "tuosi jin" for 250 yuan.

### Transport Permits Should Not Be Taken Out: Bean Buyers Increasingly Scarce; Red Bean Retailers Loosen, Price Falls Slightly 3-5 Yuan

The bean market has seen a decrease in buyers due to the slightly easier acquisition of transport permits, and the market is relatively quiet. Retailers loosening their hold on red beans has led to a price decline of 3-5 yuan. Other beans are also dull and weak. The transactions included 84 bags of Tianjin red beans at 168 yuan, 215 bags of Chongming sand red beans at 172-168 yuan, 30 bags of Changzhou cowhide yellow beans at 103 yuan, 20 bags of Pudong du beans at 203 yuan, and 10 bags of Zhangjiakou tea beans at 222.5 yuan.

### Bran Country Sales Still Active: Prices Rise 1-2 Yuan

Bran sales in the countryside remain active, and market sentiment continues to be optimistic, with prices rising another 1-2 yuan. Yesterday, 1,000 bags of "Sanxin Small Package" bran opened, with the end-of-March warehouse receipt price at 80 yuan, the May 5 warehouse receipt at 89 yuan, the May 20 warehouse receipt at 90-91 yuan, and the end-of-May warehouse receipt at 91 yuan.

### Rumors of Government Control of Corn and Red Sorghum Lead to Price Reductions by Speculators

Rumors of government control of corn and red sorghum led to buyer apprehension, and speculators, fearing losses, reduced prices, causing prices to fall by 4-5 yuan. The transactions included one cart of Wuhu corn at 125 yuan, three carts of Mingguang red sorghum at 113-108 yuan, and two carts of Taizhou red sorghum at 113-123 yuan.

Delays in Bean Cake Loading Lead to Rare New Transactions, Prices Fall Another 2-3 Yuan

Delays in inland transportation of bean cake have led to rare new transactions, causing market sentiment to remain weak and prices to fall another 2-3 yuan. The transactions included 1,500 pieces of "Lizi" cake with May new warehouse receipts at 54.5-53 yuan, 1,500 pieces of "Shengji" cake with May old warehouse receipts at 51.5-48.3 yuan, 2,000 pieces with February warehouse receipts at 53-52 yuan, 500 pieces with April new warehouse receipts at 56.5 yuan, and 1,000 pieces with June new warehouse receipts at 58-56.5 yuan.

Cold Storage Longan Pulp Not Intended for Immediate Sale

Ordinary longan pulp has recently seen increased demand from northern merchants, tightening the market. Market supplies of branded goods are exhausted, and warehouse inventories are also limited, leading to a 100 yuan price increase. Last year's new goods have mostly been moved into cold storage, maintaining their quality and making them unsuitable for immediate sale, further tightening market inventories. This is the reason for the price increase. (Yesterday's report stated that the first batch of black leaf branches was returned by the original ship, causing delays in Shanghai and requiring reloading on a later ship. This has been corrected).

Sugar Stocks Slightly Tight

Yesterday, although the volume of sugar stocks traded through the cooperative was not large, the market was slightly tight. Coarse granulated sugar initially traded at 304 yuan, later rising to 305 yuan, up 1 yuan from the previous day. Red sugar was initially flat, then tightened, opening at 292 yuan, later at 293 yuan, up 5 cents from the previous day.

Dried Lily Bulbs Rise Slightly

Recently, the supply of dried lily bulbs has gradually decreased. Demand from medicinal and Cantonese merchants is normal, but sellers are few due to relatively low prices. Therefore, the market has seen a slight increase. Yesterday's market saw high-quality goods sold at 200 yuan, and lower-quality goods at 180-190 yuan.

Cigarettes in Stalemated Situation

The cigarette market is trending towards improvement, as market participants believe that the prices of various goods are approaching factory prices. Therefore, holders of goods are temporarily taking a wait-and-see approach. Brands such as "Great Britain Old Knife" are trending upward, while the rest are in a stalemated situation. "Great Britain" traded at 8,650 yuan, "Old Knife" at 5,500 yuan, up 200 yuan from the previous day. "Pinhai" was at 4,500 yuan, "Fairy" at 4,000 yuan, and "Wuhua" at 3,850 yuan, with little change. The "Golden Gun" brand has seen slightly tighter momentum, opening at 1,520 yuan yesterday. "Golden Mansion" was at 2,250 yuan, "Red Rose" at 1,350 yuan, "Quanlu" at 2,000 yuan, "Guide" at 1,450 yuan, "Nianzhi Quanlu" at 2,020 yuan, "National Cigarette Beautiful" at 3,400 yuan, and "Golden Mouse" at 1,980 yuan.

Matches Fall Sharply

The selling price of daily necessities is flat and weak. The rumors of price controls have caused market sentiment to be extremely weak, resulting in quiet trading. Holders of goods are eager to sell, while buyers, due to small profits and many risks, are reluctant to accept. Therefore, matches have seen a sharp decline. "Phoenix" brand fell to 3,100 yuan, "Beautiful" brand to 3,200 yuan, and miscellaneous brands to 2,400 yuan, down 300-400 yuan from the previous day. Soap remains stable, with "Guben" soap at 325 yuan, "White Xiangmao" soap at 270 yuan, "Arrow Knife" soap at 270 yuan, "Yellow Xiangmao" soap at 225 yuan, "White Libushi" candles at 130 yuan, and "Monk's Hat" brand at 125 yuan, all generally flat.

A Brief Discussion on Eliminating Parasites by Lin Bao

According to a recent report, the National Socialist German Workers' Party's Racial Policy Bureau will take emergency measures against all "social parasites" within the country, such as habitually lazy unemployed people, drunkards, beggars, and "individuals unable to participate in social work." These individuals will generally be sent to special labor camps for forced labor.

If we set aside other issues and focus solely on the elimination of social parasites, it could be considered a meritorious and virtuous policy.

Idle parasites are a unique product of capitalist society and are not entirely unexpected. These parasitic elements only engage in rent-seeking and consumption, without any productive function. It would be truly strange if they were not eliminated.

However, as far as we know, social parasites can be divided into two levels: lower and higher. The so-called lower-level parasites are the unemployed people, drunkards, and beggars that Germany seeks to eliminate, the "dregs of society." As for higher-level social parasites, they are some of the most respectable figures in society, who, while similarly idle and contributing nothing to society, are impossible to eliminate. Enforcing compulsory labor on social parasites is certainly a good thing, but instead of implementing such passive strategies, why not eliminate the parasitic class at its root? Of course, this requires the use of a little brainpower.

Talks on European Nationalities (Part 1) by Dake

A traveler, returning from Australia, once said: "Everything seems to be abnormal in this place; there are mammals with bird beaks, parrots that are completely black, bees without stingers. Some trees shed only the bark from their trunks when they wither, while their leaves do not fall. There is also a strange cherry whose flesh is hidden inside the pit. There is an idiom in Australia that says: In Australia, women have no beauty, birds do not sing well, and flowers lack fragrance. From this saying, one can imagine how wild and barren this place must be."

In fact, in recent decades, this isolated land in the ocean has received the baptism of modern civilization and is no longer what it once was. Look at the many places along the coast, where towns are close together and railways crisscross, resembling a modern country. However, if you carefully study the local people, you will find that in various parts of Australia, especially in the interior, there are still many uncivilized people living their primitive lives.

The aboriginal people of Australia are not completely black but slightly reddish-brown. Their hair is pure black and slightly curly. Their limbs are usually very thin, especially their legs, which are long. The women's feet often have a curved shape. The heads of Australians are particularly distinctive. Their skulls are thin and long, shaped like olives. Their foreheads protrude outward, their noses are flat, their cheekbones are high, their mouths are wide, and their teeth are thick. Such a face is not up to the standard of beauty, so you may not find it easy to find a beautiful woman among the Australian girls.

In northern Australia, in the temperate and evergreen zone, people are completely naked. However, they also know that wearing clothes is a sign of civilization - although those who wear clothes are sometimes not much more civilized than they are - so when they get hold of a piece of old European clothing, they consider themselves civilized. When they approach foreigners, they wear those old clothes and act very polite, but when they return to their own kind, they quickly take off their clothes, unwilling to endure these superficial forms of civilization.

However, the love of beauty is universal. Although Australians dislike wearing clothes, they appreciate ornaments. They often wear necklaces made of shells, and sometimes they can be seen wearing headbands or bands made of bark or fine thread. The most valuable ornaments are animal hairs glued to the shoulders, back, chest, and waist with sealing wax, but these ornaments are only seen on grand festive evenings and are rarely seen at other times.

In addition to this, they also use sharp stone flakes to make long, horizontal scars on their chests and abdomens, or to tattoo various patterns on their shoulders. To prevent the cut skin from healing, they apply ash and sand to the wounds, or they allow ants to bite them. When the skin has festered to a considerable extent, they let it scar over on its own, so their bodies have raised marks.

Many bright-eyed people pierce a hole in the tips of their noses and insert a short stick into the hole. It is said that this is a highly valued ornament (if they have a clay pipe, they will proudly show it to everyone; the wooden stick inserted in the tip of the nose will be replaced by the stem of the pipe).

Australians are not very particular about cleanliness. Their hair is full of fleas and lice, but the taste of fleas and lice is very much to their liking. When two friends meet, they search each other's hair for parasites, while savoring the lice they catch from their friends' bodies.

Australians do not farm or raise livestock; they live by hunting. Their hunting tools, in addition to the hunting dogs they keep, are only a few clumsy weapons. When they hunt, they often use a spear made of a tree branch or hardwood root. However, they also have a very strange weapon called a "boomerang." This is a wooden knife with a curved shape and a fairly sharp edge. This knife can be thrown a long distance, and if it does not hit the target, it will fly back to the hunter's side. This weapon is most useful for hunting birds.

When a hunter catches a kangaroo or other animal, he and his family eat a full meal. If he returns empty-handed, he randomly gathers some leaves, roots, wild fruits, or ant larvae. However, he often climbs trees quickly to steal honey, because honey is a food they eat a lot of.

Their food is mostly cooked over a fire. They make fire using the old method of drilling wood to make fire. However, because this method is quite troublesome, some tribes preserve the fire, so when they move, the women carry burning branches.

The most beloved dish of the Australian people is human flesh. They think that the flesh of black people tastes the best, while the flesh of white people is not nearly as good. To obtain human flesh, they commit assassinations or engage in wars with hostile tribes. In war, their defensive weapons are wooden shields, which are painted with vermilion lines using human blood.

These tribes do not seem to have metal tools. Their knives and other tools are made of shells or wood and stone. They do not know pottery, but they can weave grass mats, baskets, and water containers made of tree bark.

(3) Our Lives

Our working hours are approximately from 8 a.m. to 9 p.m., while the late shift is from 10 a.m. to around 11 p.m. to 12 a.m., until all the customers leave. Every day, we do tasteless and familiar work. The topics that help them in their conversations are the classics of gambling, but there are also many regular "good guys." However, in their eyes, these people are what they call "outdated."

They (and sometimes I am included) love to read martial arts epics and so-called romantic novels and erotic pink novels. They are truly fascinated and addicted to them, perhaps because they really have some captivating magic. So, if they can't rent them, they buy them to read. Outside of working hours, they truly "never let go of the book." Our treatment, rather than saying it is "strange," it is better to say it is "unfair." Why? Because those who work the hardest earn the least, but some skilled workers can earn a small commission. They often have the "three easies song," where "three easies" means: easy to eat, close to food; easy to wear, company uniforms; easy to spend, money is easy to get. But it's still not enough. I think I'll add two more easies for them, to make it "five easies": "easy to live, not knowing how time passes" and "easy to turn white, prematurely greying."

I haven't lied above. The days I am conscious, I always feel pain. The days I feel pain, I must shout out loud, so that the capable young people of the Cantonese cuisine industry can jointly bear the mission of "transforming the Cantonese cuisine industry"! We must discard the stale and build up the brilliant! (The end)

Sunglasses Can Cure Malaria by Mojin

A pair of sunglasses can cure severe malaria. You would dismiss it as absurd nonsense, right? In fact, this is absolutely true and not just some whimsical medical technique that I came up with because I have malaria and hate those who hoard quinine. This is a great contribution to humanity and an unprecedented, miraculous discovery in medicine by Soviet physician Dr. Subelman.

Dr. Subel and Man are members of the Moscow National Tuberculosis Prevention Association and experts dedicated to researching malaria treatments. He has been engaged in malaria treatment research for nearly twenty years, and has finally achieved complete success.

First, he investigated the properties of the malaria-specific drug "quinine" and finally discovered that "quinine" solutions can absorb purple and ultraviolet light. He then tested other anti-malarial drugs one by one, and the results were the same: they all have this special optical property. He then hypothesized that any product that is effective in treating malaria has the characteristic of absorbing purple and ultraviolet light, and that malaria and light must have a close relationship.

Coincidentally, a friend of his suffering from severe malaria came to him for medical treatment. His teeth were chattering, he was shivering all over, and his body temperature was very high. His condition was terrible. However, he did not give his friend any medical treatment, only asking him to stay in a dark room. What a mysterious matter! Upon entering the dark room, the progress of the malaria stopped, and his friend returned to normal. His body temperature also quickly decreased. His ideal experiment was a success. Experience told him that no matter how stubborn and untreatable malaria was with other methods, it would heal in a dark room after a few days.

Therefore, he came to the conclusion that external light, especially short-wave purple and ultraviolet light, is the cause of malaria. The main cause of malaria is, of course, the germ, but without the influence of short-wave light, the germ cannot move as it pleases. Light cannot enter the body through other paths, only through the eyes. Therefore, if malaria patients are in a dark room and cannot see the light, they will recover from their long illness as if nothing had happened.

It is very inconvenient and uneconomical to specially prepare a dark room for malaria patients. So, he came up with a very strange treatment for malaria, which is to have the patient wear sunglasses - tinted lenses - to prevent short-wave light from entering the body. This can make malaria have a chance to heal.

This discovery of a treatment has been proven to be extremely effective, attracting the deep attention of the medical community. It is hoped that further and more in-depth research will be continued in this area.

War: Clever Camouflage by Xie Bin

In war, the most important thing is, of course, to reduce losses, so camouflage has become the first priority. All kinds of disguises are products of history. Soldiers need to be camouflaged, tanks need to be camouflaged, and factories, power plants, and important factories all need to be camouflaged. The basic principle of camouflage is nothing more than blending in with the surrounding natural environment so that the enemy cannot distinguish the real from the fake. As shown in the picture above, from a distance it looks like just a group of tall trees, but in reality it is the cooling tower of an important power plant. The picture shows the camouflage of a tank. It is difficult for airplanes to find it from above because its color matches the grassland.

Sailing in the Same Storm by He Jiaji

(6) A Snap of the Fingers

Madam Ye Er was sitting on the edge of Wei Cheng's bed, talking and answering Wei Cheng's questions, while examining the cleanliness of the pillowcase, whether it was clean or not, which meant whether Xique and Mother He were diligent or not. Hearing Wei Cheng ask her, she laughed, "If you marry a wife, then I will give half of the dowry to your wife." Wei Cheng nodded and said, "Yes." Madam Ye Er couldn't wait for him to say this and continued, "Then in your mind, who is suitable to come to our house as a daughter-in-law?" Wei Cheng said, "I have no preconceived notions." Madam Ye Er said, "That's a problem. What about Cui Zhen? She's like she grew up in our house." Wei Cheng shook his head. Madam Ye Er said, "Shaking your head, shaking your head means you don't agree." Wei Cheng stared at Cui Zhen's small portrait on the wall and said, "It's not that I don't agree." Madam Ye Er said, "If you don't disagree, why are you shaking your head?" Wei Cheng said, "I'm just afraid of what people will say." Madam Ye Er said, "Afraid of what people will say? People only care about their own affairs, they don't care about my family's affairs." Wei Cheng laughed and said, "People will say that I tried my best to get Sister Cui Zhen to come to our house because I had this intention a long time ago. Really, I don't have any." Madam Ye Er said, "I know, Cui Zhen is a bit rougher than Miss Chen. Of course, she can't compare to Miss Chen in beauty, and Miss Chen has more ink in her belly. Young people nowadays want to go out hand-in-hand, and going out with Miss Chen, who wouldn't say it's good. What about Miss Chen?" Wei Cheng shook his head involuntarily. This surprised Madam Ye Er, who asked, "You still don't agree? We think Miss Chen is very good, your aunt, your aunt, your great aunt, and your second aunt all say she's good. It's just that she doesn't know how to work in the fields, but that doesn't matter, we have farm workers and old servants. And she also grew up in the countryside, and now she lives in Shanghai, but she hasn't learned the bad habits of Shanghai people. Living for a year and a half, she'll understand the customs of the countryside." Wei Cheng paused for a moment and said, "She, she..." Madam Ye Er said, "Say it, don't have any scruples. At first, I heard Cui Zhen say that Miss Chen already had a mother-in-law's family, but later Cui Zhen lived in Shanghai for a few days and learned that she didn't. If she doesn't, that's great." Wei Cheng said, "She doesn't have a mother, and she opposes her father. This habit, maybe she can only be a good friend, but it would be a bit of a stretch to ask her to be a virtuous wife. (111)"
