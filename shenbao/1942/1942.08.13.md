### Deep Concern in American Political Circles

Berlin, November 11th, Allied News Agency: According to news arriving there via Amsterdam, the chaotic state of India has aroused great anxiety and concern in the United States. Most American church newspapers have expressed approval of the British authorities' oppressive policies towards the Congress Party. However, another part of the newspapers believes that this measure by the British authorities has instead given the Indian people an excuse to carry out a disobedience movement, and therefore strongly criticized this rash action by the British authorities. What American political and military circles are most concerned about is that the disturbances in India will have an extremely adverse impact on the Allied war effort. According to a commentary in the New York Times, the Allies have very high expectations regarding India's cooperation in the war, and America's destiny is closely linked to India's development.

New York, November 12th, Havas News Agency: The Indian League in the United States today passed a resolution protesting the arrest of leaders such as Gandhi and Nehru and appealing to President Roosevelt to intervene.

Bern, Switzerland, November 11th, Havas News Agency: After the Gandhi arrest incident, British detached Labour parties and others requested the convening of Parliament for open discussion. According to a Swiss telegraph agency London visitor's telegraph, citing the Daily News diplomatic correspondent's opinion, its general idea is, the British government has not yet decided to convene Parliament, because open debate is by no means the time, one reason is that once an open debate, all parties' views on the Indian problem, inevitably divergence, this situation will immediately be known by the Indian side, resulting in making the situation even more complex. However, our authorities should take severe measures to deal with Indian reactionary elements, especially those who voted in favor of the "British cars out of India" resolution, should be deported.

### Chongqing Newspapers Comment on Indian Events

Lisbon, November 11th, Allied News Agency: According to a Reuters dispatch from Chongqing, Chongqing newspapers were initially quite subdued regarding the Governor-General of India's suppression of the National Congress Party. However, on the 11th, all newspapers uniformly published editorials commenting on the Indian problem, expressing great regret over the British suppression and the deterioration of the situation in India. For example, the Chongqing official newspaper, the Central Daily News, stated: "We were deeply saddened to receive news of the arrest of Gandhi, Nehru, and Azhar. At this critical juncture, we are deeply concerned about the deterioration of British-Indian relations. India today has the greatest impact on Britain's anti-Allied war effort. Whatever the cause of this current predicament, we cannot support the actions of the Indians, for the fact is that it will lead to political failure. Although the Indians have been fighting for freedom under the guidance of Gandhi, Nehru, and others for twenty years, if the situation in India is allowed to continue to deteriorate today, it will affect the entire Pacific war situation. Therefore, we sincerely hope that both the British and Indian authorities will seek an appropriate solution with patience." Also, the Yishi Bao stated that the Governor-General of India's oppressive measures only serve to increase the Indians' resentment and do nothing to resolve the predicament. We deeply regret this. The Guomin Gongbao also stated that India's demand for freedom is not contrary to the war aims of the Allies, and it is the British's duty to accept their demands. We firmly believe that the wise politicians of Britain and America will not forget the principles they set forth in the Atlantic Charter.

Rome, November 12th, Haitong News Agency: According to photos published in this newspaper yesterday, important areas along the Italian coast are protected by special armored trains, equipped with cannons and military equipment. These trains were used to protect the Adriatic coast during World War I and are now used to protect certain other coasts. Berlin, November 12th, Haitong News Agency: The German High Command issued a supplementary communiqué yesterday, detailing the sinking of several enemy ships by German submarines, as reported in yesterday's special German war bulletin. It stated that on the afternoon of August 5th, a German submarine in the North Atlantic spotted an enemy convoy and immediately telegraphed its base. All German submarines within 300 miles were ordered to prepare for an attack. That evening, a 5,000-ton cargo ship was torpedoed and sunk. Although many submarines participated in the attack, the dense fog covering the sea made it difficult to identify targets. Our submarines were repeatedly chased away by enemy destroyers. The next morning, the visibility was even worse, making it difficult to distinguish objects within 500 meters. Our submarines almost collided with enemy destroyers from time to time. Although the enemy dropped many depth charges, our submarines continued to pursue them closely. By noon on the 7th, the dense fog gradually dissipated, and the targets gradually became visible, but just as an attack was about to be launched, the sudden arrival of dense fog made it impossible to start for a while. At 5:30 a.m. on August 8th, a second cargo ship (7,000 tons) was sunk. Before long, another two ships, totaling 15,000 tons, sank to the bottom of the sea. Soon after, a 7,000-ton cargo ship sank after being damaged. At that time, the visibility continued to deteriorate. On the morning of the 9th, a German submarine damaged a destroyer. On the morning of the 10th, the German submarines launched a final attack, sinking two merchant ships, totaling 14,000 tons, and damaging several others. The enemy convoy managed to escape after five days of pursuit. The commanders of all the submarines participating in this attack were young and inexperienced, making this achievement all the more commendable.

### Soviet Troops Concentrate Main Forces to Defend Stalingrad; Caucasus Front Employs Scorched Earth Tactics; German Forces Increase Pressure Toward Black Sea Coast

Lisbon, 11th (Allied News Agency) – According to British sources, the fate of the Caucasus-Timoshenko forces will be decided within days. The focus of the battle has now concentrated on Stalingrad. According to neutral observers, General Timoshenko has decided to abandon the defense of the Caucasus and concentrate his main forces in Stalingrad to stop the German advance on the Volga River. Reuters, Moscow, reports that German forces have made astonishing progress in the past 48 hours, and the war in the North Caucasus is nearing its end. As they retreat, Soviet troops will adopt a scorched earth policy, blowing up roads and bridges, and destroying power plants.

Lisbon, 11th (Allied News Agency) – After German mechanized units occupied Armavir, a key point in the Kuban region of the North Caucasus, they advanced south. It is reported that they have already penetrated Cherkessk, located 100 kilometers south of Armavir. According to the Soviet Information Bureau's announcement on the 11th, German and Soviet forces are currently engaged in fierce fighting in the area.

Berlin, 12th (Haitong News Agency) – According to the latest news received by Haitong News Agency, the characteristic of the Eastern Front yesterday was the increased German pressure on the areas along the Sea of Azov and the Black Sea, and the threat to Stalingrad. Soviet troops are now crowded in a narrow area between Kerch and Tuapse, with no escape from German aircraft attacks. Soviet troops in Novorossiysk have boarded ships and are withdrawing by sea. Eleven Soviet transport ships have been sunk and nine damaged by German aircraft. Therefore, the Soviets do not have enough ships to withdraw. The number of Soviet troops in the area is currently unknown. Reports of German troops crossing the Kerch Strait and German paratroopers attacking Novorossiysk have not been confirmed. Soviet troops in Stalingrad are currently putting up fierce resistance. General Timoshenko's troops are now concentrated there, and new reinforcements have been transferred to the city. The Germans believe that once the encircled Soviet troops in the Kalach district are annihilated, the German forces in that area can be transferred to put pressure on Stalingrad. There has been no news of a German attack on Pyatigorsk. It is generally believed that the Germans' second target is the Grozny oil field, the third most important oil field in the Caucasus, producing 2.6 million tons annually, and only 150 kilometers from the port of Gala on the Caspian Sea.

Berlin, 12th (Allied News Agency) – Military authorities announced today that German tanks and air force are putting pressure on the Red Army in the Sea of Azov, while Romanian troops have captured Slaviansk-na-Kubani, located 40 miles northwest of Krasnodar. Romanian forces captured Yeysk on Monday.

Somewhere on the Soviet Border, 11th (Havas News Agency) – According to the latest news from the front lines, the positions of the warring parties are roughly as follows: A large number of German troops have landed in the northern part of the Taman Peninsula and are continuing to advance. Another German force advancing along the lower reaches of the Kuban River has reached Troitsskaya. Sevryukayeva, west of Mariupol, has also been occupied by German forces. After crossing the Kalaus River, German-Romanian forces are currently advancing toward Blagodarnoye. Between the Sal River and the Don River, advance units of German troops have reached several points on the west bank of the Volga River. However, this news has not been confirmed. In the Don River delta, both sides are trying to seize strategically important points near Stalingrad, so fierce fighting has erupted and continues to this day. In the Kalach area, the Red Army is still resisting, but its main positions seem to have shifted. The Red Army is apparently being forced to retreat. German-Romanian forces are still employing a large-scale encirclement strategy, and five divisions of the Red Army are in danger of being encircled. Therefore, at present, the only option is to retreat quickly. The development of the battle in this area will have a decisive impact on the battle for Stalingrad. According to an observer, the fate of this important town has already been sealed and will be known by the end of this week. In the Rzhev area, the Red Army has launched a counteroffensive for twelve days. Today, the Red Army continued its fierce counteroffensive. The Germans also admit that the Red Army has opened a gap in the German lines. Fierce fighting is still ongoing, and the intensity of the fighting is increasing. However, this matter is not very important, because the Germans are still employing "blitzkrieg" tactics to rapidly advance in the Caucasus, attempting to occupy the ports along the Black Sea coast. Another German force, which departed from Voroshilovsk a week ago, has crossed the Kuban River and is only 90 miles away from the port of Novorossiysk. The Red Army will withdraw by sea from this port, so the port is being bombed day and night by German aircraft and has become a great hell. It is said that the casualties among the Soviet troops are very heavy. In the Mariupol area, the equipment of the oil refineries has been completely destroyed by the Red Army on its own initiative. German engineer units are now trying to restore the oil refineries and are very busy. German troops are currently climbing the mountains in the Caucasus region. As for the German troops who occupied Armavir, they have been divided into two groups. The first group has reached Mozdok, and the other group is advancing toward Ordzhonikidze and will occupy it within the next day or two. In short, another goal of the German advance in the Caucasus is to occupy the Grozny oil region. According to German claims, it is expected that the Red Army will not put up a determined resistance in the area. By the end of this week, German soldiers will reach the port of Tuapse, so they can bathe on the Black Sea coast.

Violent Battles in the Don River Bend

Soviet Counteroffensive in Rzhev

Stockholm, Sweden, 12th (Havas News Agency) – The great battle within the Don River bend west of the Kalach hills will soon come to an end. Once the remaining enemy forces within the Don River bend are cleared, the German forces will directly advance on Stalingrad. However, the Soviet side says that General Timoshenko, Commander-in-Chief of the Southern Front, is already confident in defending Stalingrad and has resolved to defend it to the death at any cost. At the same time, the fighting is also very fierce in the Rzhev area northwest of Moscow. Even the German authorities admit that the Red Army's "offensive in that area is very powerful." Other military observers also say that "this battle should not be taken lightly." As for the Caucasus region, after the Germans captured Krasnodar and Maikop, the terrain has become difficult and the progress has slowed down somewhat.

Lisbon, 11th (Allied News Agency) – According to news from London, the main force of the German offensive has reached the east bank of the Don River bend south of Kletskaya. At the same time as the German forces are attacking fiercely, there are also rumors that German paratroopers have landed behind Soviet lines. At the same time, a large group of German troops northeast of Kotelnikovo are making every effort to move north along the railway to Stalingrad. According to another report, a part of the German troops has broken through the Soviet defenses and opened a route of attack. Kotelnikovo is about 80 kilometers from Kletskaya. If the Germans connect the south of the Kletskaya front line with the northeast of the Kotelnikovo front line, then the German attack will cause the Soviet troops on the Stalingrad front to face the greatest crisis. The Soviet Union has also admitted this. According to a report from the front-line correspondent of Izvestia, the situation behind Stalingrad has become very serious, and its danger is constantly increasing. Furthermore, the Soviet newspaper Pravda reported on the 11th that the fighting in the Kotelnikovo area is still continuing. Soviet troops are constantly resisting, and Soviet and German forces are engaged in fierce fighting with cross-fire. The situation is extremely intense.

Berlin, 12th (Havas News Agency) – The German High Command announced in a special war report this morning that most of the Soviet 62nd Army and most of the 1st Tank Army have been annihilated by our land and air forces within the Don River bend west of Kalach. 57,000 people were captured, along with over 1,000 tanks and 750 field guns. Since the German forces launched a spring offensive in the Kerch Peninsula, up to this battle in the Don River bend, German forces and their allies have captured 1,044,741 Soviet officers and soldiers, seized 6,271 tanks, 10,131 various field guns, and shot down 4,960 aircraft. In addition, 664 were shot down by anti-aircraft guns, and 432 were destroyed at airfields.

One of the Three Major Oil Regions of the Caucasus

Falls into German Hands

Bern, Switzerland, 11th (Havas News Agency) – According to the "Journal de Genève," after the fall of Maikop, one of the three major oil regions of the Caucasus has fallen into German hands. Not only that, but there are other oil fields north of the city, such as near Krasnodar, where a small number of oil fields have already been developed. In particular, the oil wells in Kaluzhskaya (30 miles north of Krasnodar), Adygeyskaya (between Krasnodar and the Black Sea), and Krymskaya (near Novorossiysk) are the largest in scale. The Maikop oil fields were discovered on the eve of World War I and had prospects for development, but the Russian Revolution disrupted domestic order and greatly reduced production. However, in 1929, a new oil field was discovered near Apsheronskaya (southwest of Maikop, not on the Apsheron Peninsula), and its reserves are among the largest in the world. Some of these oil wells can produce around 800 tons of oil per day. As a result, Maikop oil production increased greatly, from only 157,000 tons in 1929 to 766,000 tons in 1933, and further to 2,250,000 tons in 1938. Today, its production is probably around 3 million tons, and its reserves are at least 50 million tons. As for transportation, Maikop has a railway passing through Krasnodar, and there is an oil pipeline that can send crude oil to refineries in the city for refining. In addition, there is also a railway that leads to the Black Sea port of Sochi, which is very convenient. The oil pipeline from Baku to Rostov also passes through here, so the situation is becoming increasingly important. The Soviet Union may have implemented a scorched earth policy, destroying the oil wells. If so, it will take the Germans several months to restore production.

Bern, Switzerland, 12th (Havas News Agency)

Soviet newspapers and wireless radio stations remain silent on the Moscow conference. However, observers here believe that although the situation in the Caucasus is extremely important, Stalin and his staff do not believe that the German and Soviet forces will engage in a decisive battle there. Moscow and the Volga River region are actually more important. In any case, the Soviet Union shows no sign of ceasing resistance.

Ankara, 12th (Haitong News Agency) – When the Turkish Parliament convenes today, it may announce the appointment of Undersecretary of Foreign Affairs Menemencioğlu as Minister of Foreign Affairs. The vacant position of Undersecretary may be filled by former Turkish Ambassador to Bulgaria Bey Belme. Menemencioğlu was born in 1891 and graduated from the Faculty of Law of Lausanne University. In 1914, he joined the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs. From the following year, he was assigned to Turkish diplomatic missions in Vienna, Rome, Paris, Romania, Greece, Hungary, and Beirut. In 1928, he became the Director of the First Department of the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

### German Forces Intercept Secret Soviet Military Order; Berlin Discloses Its Contents

Berlin, 12th (Haitong News Agency) – The German army, during its pursuit of retreating enemy forces between the Don and the Caucasus, raided the Soviet General Staff in the area and seized a secret military order issued by Stalin prohibiting retreat. The order was issued on July 28 and was stamped with "Secret Military Order No. 227 issued by the People's Commissariat for Defense of the Soviet Union, July 28, 1942." It was signed by "Stalin, People's Commissar for Defense of the Soviet Union." Its contents stated that the Red Army's repeated retreats to the east have disappointed the people of the whole country, and some have even criticized them. The Red Army has almost lost the hearts of the people. Our country's resources are not unlimited. Since losing Ukraine, Belarus, the Baltic States, the Donets Basin, and other territories, the national border has been shrinking, which means a reduction in import factory resources. From now on, our manpower and material resources can no longer be superior to Germany. If we continue to retreat, it will be tantamount to announcing our collapse. If we do not hold our ground and fight, then our bread, fuel, metal resources, railways, and factories will all be lost. Our country has now entered the most difficult period. Order and military discipline have disappeared. Therefore, it is necessary to annihilate the defeatists. German military discipline is extremely strict. Now, in order to rectify military discipline, the General Staff of the Red Army has issued the following military orders: Military councils, especially commanders of the front lines, are responsible for eliminating the defeatist atmosphere in the army and preventing propaganda that is unrelated to the battle and promotes withdrawal to the east. Any army commanders who allow soldiers to leave their positions without special orders will be severely punished according to military law. Units that retreat in battle will have their officers and political commissars organized into special service battalions and sent to the most dangerous areas to fight. Army commanders, division commanders, or political commissars who allow their soldiers to retreat without authorization will be dismissed and severely punished according to military law. Reliable troops will be stationed behind each army battlefield to execute fleeing soldiers who retreat from the front and organize reliable special service battalions to be sent to dangerous areas for emergency response. Battalion commanders or regimental commanders and their political commissars who allow their soldiers to retreat without authorization will also be dismissed and punished according to military law.

### The History of the Caucasus (Part 2)

To us today, this seems an incredible thing, why an empire as well-equipped with weapons as Russia should be so wearied by suppressing a handful of primitive peoples. Modern blitzkrieg tactics might crush their resistance in an instant. However, we must know that in those days, the fortified villages on the peaks of Dagestan could not be reduced by heavy artillery bombardment or aerial bombing, and the natives living in the forests were so adept at using their lairs in the vast and sparsely populated forests that it was simply impossible to engage them. The Russian army fought as if against phantom enemies, constantly disappearing from their sight, yet threatening their lines of communication with surprise attacks at every moment of Russian unpreparedness, resulting in demoralization, and every possible victory often turning into a rout. Only when the natives left the protection of their ancestral forests did the Russian army occasionally find itself in an advantageous position.

The natives fought to the death. They were motivated not only to defend their long-held freedom but also by religious fanaticism. It should also be noted that the advocacy by a few Russian generals of a policy of terror to exterminate the natives only intensified this fanaticism. According to some historians, had the Russian General Yermolov not used the pretext of native cruelty to implement extremely cruel policies, the militant religious movement called Murldism might never have occurred, and its leaders would not have wearied Russia until the 1850s.

The harsh policies adopted by Russia towards its new protectorates also caused great dissatisfaction, eventually leading to rebellions in various Georgian states. However, Russia faced an extremely difficult task, as the geography of the region, suitable for division into small states and tribal territories, had become commonplace. Therefore, Russia was ultimately able to complete the unification of Georgia. Developing transportation and introducing modern living skills must be recognized as a great achievement. If left to their own devices, the anarchic, extravagant, and artistically gifted Georgians would never have achieved this progress.

The Georgian atmosphere—a love of gorgeous clothing, frenzied dancing, and boisterous feasts celebrating ancient folk songs—moved countless travelers of the past, including the author of one of the oldest travelogues about the Caucasus, published eighty years ago. He amusingly described how he was once embarrassed by the incessant toasts of the Georgians, resulting in him becoming completely drunk.

The same book also describes visits to deep mountains and isolated valleys, where countless generations of tribes have lived (and still live) in complete isolation from the outside world, wearing chain mail onto the battlefield and carrying all sorts of bizarre ancient weapons.

Russian orders never had much effect among these natives, and their hostility towards Russia was very stubborn and tended towards extremes. The most serious incident occurred in 1812, the year when Russian power in the Caucasus faced its greatest threat. Popular rebellions broke out throughout Georgia, and soon all the mountain tribes united to resist the saviors who had been so welcomed a few years earlier. Fortunately, Russia concluded a peace treaty with Turkey at a critical moment; the campaign against the native base of Shatil in 1813 turned the tide; and by the time Yermolov arrived to take office as commander-in-chief in 1816, order had been completely restored.

Undoubtedly, Yermolov was one of the most outstanding generals in Russia at the time. In the eyes of his countrymen, he always occupied the first position among the many generals who had been sent to the Caucasus; his popularity was not only because of his repeated victories on the battlefield but also because of his great care for his subordinates; at the same time, his eccentric personality and unique insights further elevated his status. The so-called unique insights included his open contempt for the German influence that prevailed at the Russian court at the time. He was fortunate to work with a chief of staff named Velyaminov, who was superior to Yermolov in terms of talent, education, and military knowledge, but Yermolov was undoubtedly a more admired figure.

Yermolov's greatest aim in his repeated expeditions was to quell native dissatisfaction and disloyalty so as to avoid Russian worries about its southern borders, which is certainly beyond reproach; but we cannot deny the many criticisms issued by General Paskevich, who succeeded him in 1826. He said that if Yermolov had shown greater ingenuity and compassion, his own work and that of his successors would have become much easier, and the suffering and hardships endured by the innocent could have been greatly reduced.

### Joint Relief Work Organized, Continued Evacuation of Population, Relief Tickets Issued to Impoverished Citizens to Subsidize Travel Expenses, Various Hometown Associations Can Introduce Applicants

Since the Shanghai Municipal Council's Chinese Evacuation Committee has been handling evacuation work, it has achieved remarkable results. Previously, it cooperated with China Central Railway Company and East Asia Shipping Co., Ltd., and all citizens returning to their hometowns enjoyed a 50% discount on transportation. However, as the burden on the two companies was too heavy, the 50% discount on transportation has been discontinued. It is now learned that the evacuation committee believes that the evacuation of the population in the city should not be stopped, and at the same time, there are many people who cannot afford to return to their hometowns. With the consent of the Shanghai Branch of the Relief Committee, joint relief work has been organized. All impoverished citizens returning to their hometowns who genuinely need subsidies for travel expenses can apply to the committee at Office No. 277 of the Shanghai Municipal Council. After the committee approves the application, it will issue relief tickets, which can be used to collect travel expenses at the Shanghai Branch of the Relief Committee. It is also heard that various hometown associations can also introduce impoverished citizens to the evacuation committee to apply, so as to make it more widespread. It is expected that the evacuation work will be easier to promote in the future, which is often related to the city's food, security, and other aspects.

### All Industry and Trade Markets Closed Today

Today, the authorities of the two concessions in the city have implemented special precautions.

At the same time, the new method of sealing off infected areas approved by the General Manager of the Shanghai Municipal Council, Okazaki, should be followed. The area around the infection site should be blocked off with warning ropes to facilitate disinfection by the Health Department. Except for epidemic prevention personnel with certificates and documents, other people are not allowed to enter or exit freely. After receiving this order, the self-defense corps informed the citizens in various districts of this intention.

The Postal Administration recognized and transferred 140 postal workers to work in the interior last month. According to the reporter of Datong Daily News, this matter still needs to be realized after the issuance of travel permits. Therefore, they have not been able to depart yet. As for the increase in postal rates, it has been decided to implement it on September 1st. The increase is exactly equal to twice the original price. This is to make up for the various losses after the price increase in Shanghai.

### Post Office Handles Small Parcel Post, Deadline for Collection, Overdue Fees

The Shanghai Postal Administration, on the order of the General Post Office, has stated that many recipients of small parcel post that must be collected at the post office delay in collecting them after receiving the notice, which increases the responsibility for safekeeping and the accumulation of expenses for the post office. It is now specifically stipulated that from now on, overdue fees will also be charged for small parcel post in accordance with the regulations for parcels. The details are as follows: Recipients who collect the parcel within five days of receiving the notice are exempt from overdue fees; those who collect it after five days but within ten days will be charged 20 cents per day; those who collect it after ten days will be charged 40 cents per day.

### Elderly and Infirm Patients Can Have Family Members Collect Their Identification Cards

The general affairs offices of the Baojia districts in the French Concession have issued a notice to residents of the concession, stating that "When collecting a residence identification card, you must have a valid proof of rabies vaccination from a recent period, along with the stub of the application form, and collect it from the police station under your jurisdiction. Those who are sick, pregnant, or disabled can have a doctor's certificate. The elderly and children can have their household heads explain the situation, and their family members can collect the card on their behalf. Residents are urged to get vaccinated in advance to avoid sudden rush when the time comes. "The Buddhist Academic Weekly Lecture at Jing'an Temple will hold its fourth lecture at 9:00 am on the 16th of this month.

### Robbery at a Watch Shop on Rue Paul Beau, One Thief Arrested, Details, Another Accomplice's Identity Has Been Determined

Yesterday's report on the robbery at a watch shop on Rue Paul Beau (today's South Shaanxi Road), the details are as follows: On the morning of the 11th of this month, at 9:15 am, two thieves went to the Huili Watch Shop at No. 453 Rue Paul Beau. One thief with a gun entered the shop, and the other thief was on the lookout nearby. The thief with the gun asked the shop owner to show him three watches, and then threatened him with the gun. Fortunately, the shop owner was alert and escaped through the back door, shouting "Robbery!" As a result, the thief also fled with his pistol, but was chased by Russian Officer Gan No. 6 and Chinese Officer No. 261 of the French Police who were patrolling nearby. At the same time, the reserve team of the Avenue Foch Police Station had also arrived and surrounded him. The thief fled into Lane 698, but seeing that there was no way out, he thought of breaking into the residence at No. 8 in the lane and preparing to resist arrest. However, the pursuing police officers finally surrounded him and disarmed him. As for the other accomplice, who is 18 years old, the police have determined his identity and expect to arrest him soon.

### Kamakura Maru Has Left Kobe, Scope of Evacuation Confirmed, Envoys from Belgium and Other Countries Retreat with the Ship, Second Batch of American Evacuees Expected in Early Autumn

According to the English-language *Shanghai Times*, the fourth evacuation ship, Kamakura Maru, is expected to arrive in Shanghai from Kobe this Friday and is scheduled to carry British nationals and other Allied nationals to Lourenço Marques (now Maputo) on Sunday (the 16th). This ship departed from Yokohama on August 10 and moored at the Kobe pier yesterday. After a few hours, it sailed towards Shanghai.

Evacuation from Peiping (Beijing)

Among the 900 evacuees who arrived in Shanghai the night before last on the Kamakura Maru included 300 British officials from Shanghai, 70 British officials from other occupied areas of China, 90 officials from other Allied countries, and 350 British civilians (including 150 residing in Shanghai), and 90 other Allied civilians. Therefore, none of the passengers on the Kamakura Maru were from Japan. It is learned that more than 100 evacuees from Peiping arrived in Shanghai the night before last to prepare for this evacuation. Another batch of about 200 evacuees is expected to arrive today. These British nationals are temporarily staying at the Columbia Country Club.

Evacuating Officials

Nationals of Allied governments stationed in London and wishing to leave with this evacuation include 23 Dutch nationals, 28 Belgian nationals, 31 Polish nationals, 6 Norwegian nationals, and 2 Greek nationals.

Mr. and Mrs. Maze, former Inspector General of the Maritime Customs, Mr. Feilippo, former Director General and Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council, and Mr. Smiths, former Acting Commissioner of Police, and Inspector General Robertson are all on the evacuation list.

American and Indian Nationals

Not Included. Although the names of the British nationals evacuating from Shanghai have not been finalized, as the list is still being changed during this final period, it can be determined that Mr. Flettick, Mrs. Mass, Colonel Shames, and former Director General of the Shanghai Municipal Council, Mr. Feilippo, and Mr. Robertson will be evacuating. It is heard that the complete list of evacuees will be released after the Kamakura Maru sets sail.

At the same time, a Japanese consular official confirmed yesterday that there are no American or Indian nationals among the evacuees. American nationals will evacuate on the fifth evacuation ship, and the date of departure is still under discussion. There has been no notification from Tokyo. However, reliable sources stated that the Conte Verde and Asama Maru may be used by the Japanese government as evacuation ships for another five-nation evacuation between Washington and Tokyo. According to the Japanese consulate, in any case, the second batch of American nationals will be able to evacuate in early autumn this year.

### Special Precautions in Various Districts for Today's Shanghai Battle Commemoration, Road Intersections Blocked, Pedestrians and Vehicles Inspected, Military Police Deployed to Prevent Petty Criminal Activity

Today is the anniversary of the "August 13th" Shanghai Battle. The police authorities of the two concessions, fearing that petty criminals would take the opportunity to engage in activities and disrupt public order, have decided to send a large number of Chinese and foreign police officers and reserve teams to various districts within the concessions to patrol, search pedestrians and vehicles, and completely block off all unimportant road intersections on the four borders. The intersections on both sides of Avenue Edward VII (today's Yan'an East Road) and Avenue Foch (today's Yan'an Middle Road) that connect the Public Concession and the French Concession, except for traffic arteries that must be passed by trams or buses, are also completely blocked, and police officers are strengthened to defend them. On the other hand, public gatherings are also prohibited to ensure security. Members of the self-defense corps in the Public Concession received an order from the Baojia Guidance Department yesterday, requiring them to pay special attention and be on strict alert today. In addition, the Japanese naval landing force or local police officers in various districts such as Hongkou, Zhabei, Nanshi, and West Shanghai are taking special precautions. Except for citizens who must go out for work, it is best for citizens to stay indoors today. The special precautionary measures can be completely lifted starting tomorrow morning.

Yokoyama's Report

Speech by the Minister, Allied Press Dispatch from this port: Yokoyama, the Minister of Reporting, recently gave a speech commemorating the fifth anniversary of the August 13th Incident, stating that the Sino-Japanese War broke out in Shanghai because of the anti-Japanese ideology of the Communists and the anti-Japanese education led by the United Kingdom and the United States for more than 20 years. The murder of Captain Oyama at Hongqiao Airport was not the only reason. Now, the United Kingdom and the United States have cast themselves into the net, inviting the enemy into the trap. We should commemorate Captain Oyama and other heroes who sacrificed their lives to restore East Asia. Their last thought at the time of their death was "Long live the Emperor of Japan." The Emperor of Japan's only hope is for peace in East Asia. We must respect the Japanese soldiers who died in the war. Based on the principle of coexistence and co-prosperity, Shanghai should become the cradle of the Eastern spiritual revival movement to establish a new world order. The light emanating from the East will make the whole world shine to commemorate the fallen Japanese soldiers. This is our responsibility.

Colonel Kamata

Delivers a Speech, according to the Allied Press: Colonel Kamata, the Reporting Minister of the Japanese Fleet, delivered a speech for the "August 13th" Commemoration, stating that July 7th was the first anniversary of the outbreak of the Great East Asia War after the China Incident. Today, August 13th, marks the fifth anniversary of the outbreak of the Shanghai Battle. There are infinite emotions. When the incident broke out, we adhered to the policy of non-expansion and tried our best to resolve the issue on the spot. However, the Lushan Conference suddenly issued a statement rejecting our promise to resolve the issue on the spot, and the situation took a turn for the worse. On August 9th, Lieutenant Oyama of the Shanghai Special Naval Landing Force and Private Saito were surrounded and killed by the security team while passing through Beifang Road, resulting in the so-called Oyama Incident. On August 11th, armed security teams were active in the concession, and the crisis was on the verge of war. Our naval landing force was also assigned to the concession on the 12th to maintain order in the business district. However, the waterway security team deliberately sank steamships and merchant ships in the Huangpu River, blocking the waterway and cutting off our submarine cables, cutting off communication. As a result, Shanghai, which was in a dangerous situation, was attacked at 9:00 am on August 13th, Showa 12 (1937), by plainclothes troops firing machine guns at our side from the direction of the Commercial Press near the Xiaohongbang intersection in Hongkou. Chinese reconnaissance planes also flew over the naval landing force headquarters to scout. At this point, our special naval landing force, which had been enduring and respecting the imperial policy, launched an attack on Zhabei at 3:00 pm. The naval landing force headquarters had no choice but to fight back, officially launching the first Shanghai Incident. Although I do not intend to repeat the war results of the Japanese army at that time, I believe that Shanghai is a watershed in the war situation of the China Incident. The Japanese naval landing force fought resolutely and was able to promote the mighty spirit of our imperial navy at home and abroad. If our naval landing force had failed before the arrival of the army reinforcement units, what would have been the result for our rights and interests along the Yangtze River from Shanghai? Every time I think about this, I dare not forget the loyal and heroic results achieved by the Japanese soldiers who worked together to overcome difficulties. However, the Shanghai Incident was also a major rehearsal for the Great East Asia War. To put it simply, today, the great war results achieved by the Japanese army from the west coast of the United States in the east, to the Aleutian Islands in the north, to Australia in the south, and to Madagascar in the west, are not only due to the excellence of weapons and the superiority of tactics. This is also because after the China Incident, the hostility displayed by the United Kingdom and the United States was imprinted in our minds, and in order to crush this extremely unreasonable "Washington system," it was the result of the national people passing on the hard training without any mistakes. Since the outbreak of the Great East Asia War, we have repeatedly stated that the China Incident is a part of the Great East Asia War. The reason for this is that the purpose and cause of this war are solely to defeat the United Kingdom and the United States. The background of the China Incident has been revealed to be our direct enemy. However, the final victory of the Great East Asia War must be achieved this year by unleashing and completing the firm beliefs and strength gained from the China Incident over the past five years. For this reason, today we must vow to move forward on the road to building the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere to the loyal souls who sacrificed themselves for the Shanghai Incident at that time.

### Fuxin Flour Mill and Other Nine Factories Returned Today

According to the Allied Press, the Japanese military authorities in the city have returned factories to the Chinese side eight times in succession. It has now been decided to return nine more factories on the anniversary of August 13th and lift military control. The return ceremony is scheduled to be held at 3:00 pm on the 13th. The factories to be returned this time include Fuxin Flour Mill, Maoxin Flour Mill, Jiufeng Flour Mill, Kaicheng Acid Factory, Yukang Cotton Mill, Huacheng Dyeing Factory, Wenhua Fine Arts Printing Company, and two other factories, totaling nine.

### Shanghai Municipal Council Library, Increase in Long-Term Subscribers, Over One Thousand Six Hundred Subscribers

According to the Shanghai Municipal Council Library staff, in July, the library's books were borrowed more than 10,000 volumes. The number of long-term subscribers has increased by 29, with a total of 10,202 Western books, 55 books on music, and 11,117 Chinese books, plus 420 magazines.

In July, 532 people entered the library to borrow books and read in the public reading room. In this month, 40,000 new books were added, including fiction, non-fiction, and children's books.

### Newly Invented Match Switch

The Shanghai Gongli Industrial Company has recently created a practical new invention, named the Match Switch, which can replace matches and also serve as a light switch. Once installed on the lamp holder, it is convenient to smoke and can also be used to turn on and off the lights at hand. It is beautiful and saves electricity, and is quite ingenious. It is extremely convenient to install this switch on bedside lamp holders. During this hot season, when electric fans are in full use, there is no need to worry about the fire being blown out when smoking, and the heat is gentle and not scalding. The heating wire is small and the configuration is very cheap, which is its special feature. This product is now on the market.

### Blackout Implemented Last Night, Neon Lights and Decorative Lights Turned Off, Outdoor Lights Will Be Covered

Shanghai implemented a preliminary blackout for the first time last night. All neon lights and decorative lights on stores and buildings were turned off. Therefore, the lights in Shanghai last night were far less brilliant than before. The Japanese authorities issued a notice regarding this matter yesterday morning, citing a section of the blackout regulations promulgated last week, stating that "All outdoor lights will be covered and preparations will be made to implement a preliminary blackout at any time." It is heard that the main motive for these air defense exercises is to prepare for possible air raids. At the beginning and end of each exercise, special sirens installed at eleven locations in the city will sound an alarm. The Shanghai Municipal Council also issued a notice stating that from yesterday until otherwise announced, all lights used for advertising signs and decorations in the Public Concession should be turned off and closed.

### Abnormal Climate, Various Epidemics Rampant, Deaths from Typhoid Fever Exceed Those from Cholera, Frequent Dysentery Cases Found After the Autumnal Equinox

According to the Health Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council's weekly report, the number of deaths from typhoid fever in the Public Concession last week exceeded the number of deaths from cholera. From August 1st to August 8th, a total of seventy-two people died from typhoid fever, while forty-three people died from cholera. Also, in the past week, forty-three Chinese and three foreign nationals died from pulmonary tuberculosis. Dysentery cases have been frequently found,

Over Two Thousand People

Died from Typhoid Fever Since the beginning of this year, the number of deaths from typhoid fever in Shanghai has reached 2,082. According to the Health Department authorities, about 60% of these cases are due to insufficient nutrition. Most patients do not pay attention until they are critically ill, and only then report to the hospital, but it is already too late to save them.

Number of Injections

Exceeds Record At the same time, the total number of cholera cases in Shanghai has reached 1,780, of which 1,121 are residents of the Chinese area, and 212 have died. In the French Concession, a total of 344 cases have been discovered, and the remaining 315 cases have been found in the Public Concession. The results of vaccination in both concessions have exceeded previous records as of yesterday. In the Public Concession, more than 40,000 people have been vaccinated, and in the French Concession, more than 30,000 people have been vaccinated. As of now, the total number of vaccinated people in the French Concession has reached 1,066,428. Yesterday afternoon around 6:00 PM, in the bustling area of Nanjing Road near Nissho Building, there was a strict inspection of vaccination certificates. Those without vaccination certificates, or whose vaccination time had exceeded three months, were forcibly vaccinated. Therefore, citizens who have not yet been vaccinated should actively go to various health clinics for vaccination to avoid being infected with cholera.

Cholera Transmitters

Six More Deaths Yesterday, one person in the French Concession died from cholera. At the same time, according to the Public Concession authorities, 21 new cases of cholera were discovered in the area on that day, and as many as five people died.

Dangerous Symptoms of High Fever and Chills

According to medical professionals, a new type of high fever and chills has been discovered in recent days. The patient's fever is so high that the thermometer can explode when placed in the mouth. In most cases, the temperature is measured in the armpit. The patients have no prior symptoms, so many cannot be saved. Generally, the illness is due to uneven cold and heat exposure and irregular diet and living habits. The crowded funerals in the funeral homes these days are particularly shocking.

Registration of Hidden Poverty More Than

Doubled

The Second Phase of Hidden Poverty Registration organized by the Sanjiao Moral Welfare Council has been completed. The number of registered hidden poverty households this time is more than double that of the first phase, reaching more than 1,400 households, and 19% are intellectuals. All sectors of society have expressed deep sympathy and willingness to assist in the council's work to help the hidden poor. For example, the French Commercial Charity Lottery Welfare Association donated 500 French francs to be used for relief of the hidden poor. However, the council still relies on its inherent ability to raise funds for the distribution of supplies to the hidden poor and will not solicit donations from outside for the time being. However, the expenses are huge, and in order to ensure sustainability, it is hoped that kind people from all walks of life will generously assist.

### Second Emergency Epidemic Hospital Is Extremely Busy with Defense, Number of Outpatients Exceeds 1,000 Daily, Providing Health Guidance to the Poor and Sick

Due to the hot weather and the prevalence of cholera, the Shanghai New Medicine and Pharmaceutical Trade Association, in view of the particularly crowded population in Shanghai this year, which makes it easy to spread the disease, organized the Second Emergency Epidemic Hospital on Great Western Road. The hospital has been busy with diagnosis and treatment in recent days, and its perfect operation has been praised by all sectors of society. The latest situation of the hospital is as follows:

Organization

Funding The hospital is run by the Shanghai New Medicine and Pharmaceutical Trade Association, and Mr. Xu Xiaochu was elected as the chairman of the board of directors. The organization is divided into three departments: medical affairs, administration, and accounting. Nine physicians who graduated from famous domestic and foreign medical universities and more than 30 nurses and clerks were hired, all with rich experience and serious work attitude. The original monthly budget for the hospital's operating expenses was 20,000 yuan. However, due to the large number of true cholera cases and the surge in outpatients, the consumption of medicines has been huge. In addition, the staff has to work in two shifts, day and night, so it is necessary to hire additional doctors and nurses. According to current statistics, the minimum monthly expenditure is about 50,000 yuan. The source of funds is borne by the board of directors, and there are also many automatic donations from all walks of life.

Purpose of Establishment

The main purpose of the establishment of the hospital is to help the poor and sick and provide emergency treatment for epidemics. All outpatient, inpatient, medical, food, injection, and registration items are free of charge. Emergency cases are treated immediately upon arrival, and services are provided day and night. The wards are not graded, and all patients are treated equally. No introduction is required, which is convenient for the poor and sick, and is especially praised by all sectors of society. In terms of medication, no matter how expensive the medicine is, as long as it is prescribed by a doctor, it will be purchased immediately, with the aim of saving people thoroughly.

Service

Spirit The weather has been bad these days, and there are especially many poor and sick people. The number of outpatients in the hospital exceeds 1,000 every day. The doctors and nurses are extremely tired in spirit and work even when they are sick. Their hard work is admirable. In order to prevent the spread of cholera, the hospital assists the authorities in administering vaccinations. About 1,000 people go to the hospital for vaccination every day. It also responds to the applications of various organizations and goes out to administer vaccinations. More than 50 organizations have been vaccinated, with a total of more than 20,000 people. Two public health nurses are also dispatched to the patients' homes to provide technical guidance on environmental hygiene and give lectures on public health and cholera prevention methods, so that the poor and sick can have basic prevention knowledge and achieve remarkable results.

Response from All Sectors

The hospital has a large number of outpatients and a huge amount of drug expenses. As a hospital serving the public, it is impossible for one person or one industry to bear this huge task. In recent days, various associations, such as the Shanghai Yarn Trade Association and the Chinese and Foreign Department Store Trade Association, have raised huge sums of money and sent them to the hospital. Other organizations, businesses, and individuals have also enthusiastically responded and donated. If readers have donations, please send them directly to the hospital. Address: 47A Great Western Road, Telephone: 22395.

### Impoverished University Students Allowed to Continue Applying for the Newspaper's Scholarship, Committee Decides Applications Start Immediately, Deadline is the 20th

The Shenbao Newspaper's Third Scholarship Committee held a meeting at the newspaper office at 5:00 PM yesterday. Committee members Shen Siliang, Chen Qingshi, Lu Gaoyi, Yang Nielingyu (Ding Guangdiao's representative) and Zhao Zongyuyi attended. Ding Guangxun and Ms. Xu Xuehai from the Youth Association's Impoverished Student Relief Association, as well as the newspaper's scholarship staff, were present. First, the newspaper's representative expressed sincere gratitude to the committee members for their past instructions on the scholarship policy and to the Youth Association for hosting the screening exams for the primary and secondary school groups. Secondly, the report thanked the community for the satisfactory results of this year's scholarship donations. The report also covered the examination process, the proportion of applicants and approved numbers for each group (elementary, middle, high school, industry, commerce), and the budget for allocating scholarships to each group. Then, there was a discussion on several important matters, summarized as follows:

Discussion

Key Issues:
* The committee members reviewed the exam papers and examined the list of approved scholarship recipients for primary and secondary schools.
* Students who failed the exam were re-selected, and those with passing grades were selected.
* At the beginning of the next application process, the school authorities should be asked to recommend students with excellent grades and truly impoverished families. However, the final decision will still be made by this newspaper.
* Recently, this newspaper received letters from impoverished university students requesting special accommodations to allow them to submit their applications to avoid dropping out of school. After serious discussion, the committee members believe that the students' pleas are sincere, and some are graduating from university. Once assisted, they will be able to serve society. The association should do its best to help. It was approved to extend the application period for one week from today, until the 20th of this month. All impoverished university students can quickly obtain application forms from this office and fill them out according to the procedures. However, they must have written proof from the school authorities that they are truly impoverished, studious, and of good character to be eligible. Primary, secondary, and vocational students are not allowed to request the same treatment.
* Before the next scholarship program, the diligence and actual academic performance of the past scholarship recipients should be investigated to facilitate assessment and supervision. The specific methods will be determined separately. Other matters were omitted.

Donations Yesterday

Yesterday, we received generous donations from all walks of life for the scholarship fund. The list of donors is as follows: Chun He Yong Silk and Wool Shop, Hong Fuyuan, 500 yuan; Anonymous (receipt number 1542), 406 yuan; Song Yuanyuan, 160 yuan; Shareholders of Shende Qianzhuang, 150 yuan; Mr. Ding Fubao's birthday gifts transferred to the scholarship fund, a total of 500 yuan (Cheng Zhiliang, 100 yuan; Zhou Yongyu, 50 yuan; Jiang Shihua, 50 yuan; Wang Jiarong, 50 yuan; Liu Zhifang, 50 yuan; Zhou Shuilin, 50 yuan; Chuan Jintang, 50 yuan; Fan Ruihua, 50 yuan; Zhu Zhuoxian, 50 yuan); Qiu Fenglin, 40 yuan; Tong Ji, 30 yuan; Luo Yicun, Luo Yilin, 1 yuan; Luo Huaiyi, Luo Huaijin, 1 yuan.

### Gypsies in Shanghai During Wartime: Musical Geniuses Amidst a Complex Class System

Shanghai is an international metropolis where people from all over the world can be seen, representing dozens of nationalities. Some come to Shanghai for business, but many more wander into this open port of trade with arbitrary entry. Of these wandering foreigners, Russians seem to be the most numerous. Driven out by Red Russia, they drifted here and have settled down, though they long to return to their homeland to the north, but cannot. Next are the Jews, who have recently been expelled from Europe and have flocked to Shanghai in large numbers. Their money-making skills are the most refined, leaving an even stronger impression than the Russians. But there is also another kind of wandering people who have come to Shanghai, living peacefully and minding their own business, living in a "romantic" atmosphere. They have no consular protection, nor do they have any general assembly or association to represent their interests. These are the Gypsies.

Mention of Gypsies brings to mind the image of these wandering people dressed in colorful clothes, singing and dancing. There are about 400 Gypsies in Shanghai, most of whom live in the cheaper housing around Rue du Père Robert in the French Concession. Here, one can often see women with bright red and emerald green skirts, dark, bright eyes, and dark skin, who are easily recognized as Gypsies. Every night, as you pass the intersection of Avenue Notre Dame and Avenue Joffre, Gypsy women often stop you, asking you to extend your palm to read your palm lines, for a fee of just one yuan. Gypsy women practice this trade all over the world, it seems, and are quite famous for it. However, they are only using a few hackneyed phrases to give customers a bit of empty satisfaction. They might say that one day you will become a big boss of a bank, or the lover of a famous actress; otherwise, they will say that you will have many children and grandchildren, and your old age will be blessed. Some Gypsy women even call themselves "fortune tellers," renting houses and doing business, with small signs hanging on the door, reading: "Welcome customers from 4 to 8 PM every day." It is said that some Western women in Shanghai's upper class believe in the "predictions" of Gypsy women and often go to ask for advice, of course for a higher fee, about 20 yuan each time.

Although Gypsies are wandering people with a leisurely life, they cannot help but worry about the cost of bread, tea, wine, clothing, and housing in Shanghai, where the cost of living is extremely high. Perhaps Gypsies are born with musical talent, so there are many Gypsy dancers, singers, and musicians in Shanghai who are active in nightclubs and are very popular. Like the Jews, who are also stateless wandering people, the Jews live by their business skills everywhere, calculating every penny. Gypsies, however, only carry a mandolin, wandering the world, never leaving its side. As long as they have money in their pockets, they try to find pleasure as much as possible, willing to empty their pockets before figuring out what to do next.

The Gypsies in Shanghai used to have their own nightclub, which was exciting and lively, and the best in Shanghai. The business was naturally very prosperous, but the few Gypsy directors did not know how to accumulate wealth, and eventually could not maintain it. However, nightclubs that employ Gypsies to perform can still attract many customers.

Gypsy girls have another kind of charming magic. If you know her and even take her to the cinema or other places for entertainment, then her father will definitely follow you and issue a serious warning, even resorting to violence, dragging her into the house. This is because they never allow marriage to outsiders, so the bloodline of the Gypsies is considered the purest. However, most of the Gypsies in Shanghai belong to three major tribes, and mysterious tribal feuds often occur. French Concession police officers often find two drunk Gypsies fighting fiercely in dark corners. When questioned, there is no reason, just tribal discord. The police, of course, reprimand such petty quarrels. However, one of the two Gypsies must have already suffered a loss, so he cries out to his tribe for revenge, even ambushing members of the other tribe with weapons. Therefore, tribal feuds are endless. As for young men and women, of course, they only consider marriage with friendly tribes. Since Gypsies have a romantic nature, stories of love like "Romeo and Juliet" are especially popular among young men and women.

Although the Gypsies in Shanghai are very few, their internal structure is extremely complex. In addition to tribal disputes, there are also deep class divisions. Originally, Gypsies have three hereditary social classes, each engaged in its own profession and not interacting with other professions. These are musicians, bear-keepers, and tinkers. Some Gypsies' ancestors have long since stopped engaging in these occupations, but their descendants still inherit these social class distinctions and cannot escape them. Some Gypsies consider their social status to be higher than others, inevitably revealing an arrogant demeanor. Especially in Shanghai, there is also a fourth kind of Gypsy, coming directly from India, most of whom are impoverished and live in dilapidated houses north of Suzhou Creek, eking out a living. Other Gypsies are ashamed to associate with them and refuse to speak to them.

Most Gypsies wander to the East from Hungary, Romania, or southern Russia. Along the way, various countries strictly inspect passports, but Gypsies have no passports at all, yet they manage to slip through. They first arrived in Harbin, where they were able to make a living due to the prosperity of the nightclubs. But Gypsies are used to wandering from a young age and cannot stay in one place for long, so they traveled south along the coast, passing through Qingdao and Tianjin, and finally arriving in Shanghai. Some even set out from Shanghai to wander inland, as far as Hankou, but soon returned to Shanghai. Perhaps this is their idea of paradise on earth.

There are about 400,000 Gypsies scattered throughout Europe. Their ancestors were originally slaves. After being released by the Tatars around the Middle Ages, they migrated to Europe from India or Central Asia. Some historians believe that the earliest settlement of Gypsies was Egypt, and soon they spread throughout Europe. Today, they can be found in Spain, Denmark, the United States, and South America. Because they make their homes everywhere, they are fluent in the local dialects. For example, the Gypsies in Shanghai can speak Russian, English, French, Hungarian, and Romanian, and even Chinese, German, Italian, and even Indian languages.

Gypsies are usually indifferent to politics, only concerned about the election of the Gypsy king and the annual Gypsy Congress held in Camargue. The current ruler of the Gypsies is Michel II, who was elected five years ago on a plain in Poland. He has no country, no palace, and no crown, but he wanders the roads of Europe. His loyal ministers "escort" him, following Michel II everywhere. All major decisions are made at the annual meeting of European Gypsies in Camargue. Camargue is on the plain at the mouth of the Rhone River in Switzerland. According to Gypsy tradition, after the crucifixion of Jesus, the three women, including the Virgin Mary, landed here. One of the black-skinned women was the ancestor of the Gypsies, so they gather here every year to sing, dance, and revel in memory. In recent years, Europe has been ravaged by war and transportation has been blocked, so the Gypsy Congress in Camargue has not been held.

### Bookshop Employee Accused of Defiling a Young Woman After Dismissal

Liu Mingxing, from Wujin, has been running the Mingxing Bookstore inside the Minguang Middle School at No. 2, Lane 11, Jiaozhou Road for many years. He hired Zhou Mingzhi (28 years old) from Yangzhou as an employee. At the end of last year, Liu dismissed Zhou, and Zhou opened another bookstore in the school. On the night of January 15th of this year, Zhou suddenly sneaked into Liu's place and saw Liu's daughter, Jianhua (17 years old), fast asleep and unaware, with no one else nearby. Lust arose in him, and he forcibly defiled the girl. Afterwards, he even offered to marry the girl and told her not to make it public. The girl was young and forced, so she obeyed. Later, Zhou went to the girl's place twice, on January 21st and February 24th, to continue his pleasure. By this time, the girl had learned that everything Zhou had said was a lie. Not only was he already married with two children, but he also rejected her. Unexpectedly, Zhou's lust did not die, and he sent five love letters in a row to seduce the girl. The night before last, he went again to force himself on her, and the girl shouted loudly. Her mother, Liu Yao, arrested him and took Zhou to the police station. After investigation by Detective Xia Yeshan, it was confirmed that the facts were true, and he was ordered to be detained. He was interrogated yesterday morning. The girl hired lawyer Pan Zhensheng to file a civil suit for 5,000 yuan. The court adjourned the hearing for further verification, and the defendant was sent back into custody.

American Employee of Haoning Foreign Firm Shot and Killed

Doorman Sentenced to Death

Chesnut, the thirty-year-old American shipping supervisor of Haoning Foreign Firm, went to the distribution office at 80 Meibai Road at around 3:00 PM on the 27th of last month to supervise shipping. A Hua policeman from Yangzhou, Lei Yingming, No. 2523, stepped forward to interfere with the sale of goods. Mr. Chesnut stopped him, and Lei Yingming became defiant, leading to an argument. Unexpectedly, Lei Yingming suddenly became murderous, using the rifle he was carrying to shoot at Mr. Chesnut. The bullet hit the back of his head, and he fell to the ground and died immediately. Later, Lei Yingming surrendered himself to the military police and was transferred to the police station and then to the court for prosecution.

### Xinning Shao Ship Postponed Departure for Ningbo

According to the Datong News Agency reporter, the ship will be delayed until tomorrow (the 14th) to depart from the Taikoo Wharf on the Bund in this city.

### Floating Capital Comes Out, Government Bonds Decline, But Their Base Remains Strong

Yesterday's government bond market was initially flat. Prices had been slightly higher for several days, showing a good trend. However, at the beginning of the session, bullish sentiment was slightly hesitant, and the market gradually showed small declines. Then, a large amount of floating capital came out, but sentiment remained good, and the price decline was small. In the end, Hongda, Shuntai, Xinfeng, Hengyu, and Hengtai absorbed the selling, while Shunde, Hongxing, Jiufeng, Shunli, Runheng, Xinhua, Yuanhe, Hu Heji, Lianyi, etc., sold off slightly. The final transaction volume was around 1.78 million yuan. The details are listed below:

### Chinese Stocks Fluctuate

Chinese Stock Association Ready to Be Established

The Chinese stock market was mixed, with the overall trend slightly softening. Popular stocks such as China Underwear and New Asia Pharmaceutical both experienced significant declines, with the former falling two yuan and the latter falling two yuan and twenty-five cents. Sino-French Bank fell below 80 yuan, down one yuan and a half. Yong'an and Xinxin companies were stable. Culture stocks, the Commercial Press, recovered by five yuan.

Dasheng No. 1 Factory was supported by buyers, rising five yuan, while No. 3 Factory was suppressed by four yuan. Yongxiang Printing Company and others were stable. Sentiment from all parties turned uncertain. Trading was quite active. The stock market price list is recorded below:

It is heard that the World Bookstore Co., Ltd. shares, with a face value of 50 yuan in old currency per share, will be converted to 25 yuan in new currency. However, because the company has accumulated surpluses over the years, a large sum will be allocated from the public reserve, and 25 yuan in new currency will be added to each share, matching the face value of 50 yuan in new currency. It is also heard that the bureau has decided to hold a shareholders' meeting this month to expand its capital, with every two old shares eligible for one new share.

The flower stock business in this city has recently become a destination for floating capital. Newly established stock companies are springing up like mushrooms after rain. In order to prevent speculators from taking advantage, industry leaders have organized the Chinese Stock Association. It is now heard that preparations are complete and the association will be established after approval from the authorities. As for the rumors of a stock exchange, it is unlikely to materialize recently.

### Letter

To the Editor, In the local news section of your newspaper on the 8th of this month, the article "The Mystery of Citizen Certificates" contains many inaccuracies. The resident identity card office in the French Concession only began operations at the beginning of last month. How could there be a situation where cards have not been issued for several months? The accusations of obstruction and extortion are even further from the truth. The French Concession authorities and the Central Baojia Preparatory Committee have repeatedly declared that any instances of obstruction in any Baojia procedures should be reported immediately and will be severely punished. Furthermore, in order to avoid crowding due to the extreme heat, the French authorities issue the cards daily by bao and jia. Therefore, this letter is sent to request a correction. Sincerely, Commissioner Shi, Central Baojia Preparatory Committee of the French Concession, August 12th.

Yesterday, this newspaper's reporting time was 6:30 PM.

The Japanese military bonds have become sluggish. The inter-trade price remained at 5 yuan, 5 jiao, 5 fen, and 24 li. Banks and small money exchanges sold at 5 yuan, 5 jiao, and 6 fen and bought at 5 yuan, 5 jiao, and 4 fen and a half, the same as the previous day.

### Soap, Candles, and Matches Calm

The daily necessities market was calm, with inter-trade transactions being exceptionally quiet. Observing the market trend, it is difficult to make a breakthrough in a short period of time, much like the candle market, resulting in general users finding it difficult to buy soap. Solid brand soap remained at 295 yuan, Zixiangmao soap at 240 yuan, Huangxiangmao soap at 210 yuan, and Arrow Knife soap at 250 yuan. Matches continued to fall, with Phoenix Brand at 2,650 yuan, Beauty Brand at 2,800 yuan, Golden Tripod Brand at 2,500 yuan, and Miscellaneous Brands at 2,000 yuan. White Lees candles were 120 yuan, Monk Hat brand at 115 yuan, and miscellaneous brands at 10 yuan.

### Lack of Buying at Low Prices; Cotton Cloth Recovers Well

East Cloth Yesterday, the cloth market recovered well again, with no shortage of buying. The closing price for new orders of 12-pound Longtou fine cloth was 178 yuan, and the bank order was 155 yuan and 5 jiao. Colored Ball fine cloth was 172 yuan, Flying Fish was 159 yuan, Four Gentlemen Serge was 7 yuan, 1 jiao, and 2 fen, and the bank order was 6 yuan and 4 jiao.

Factory Cloth The trade in coarse and fine cloth was quiet. Only Xinfu chicks and Shilin cloth traded well. The price was still 243 yuan. Peach Blossom Ladies Shilin also traded actively, with a price of 248 yuan and a half at the opening and the final transaction at 256 yuan and a half. 16-pound Earth coarse cloth was quoted at 173 yuan, and Flying Hong at 170 yuan, and 12-pound Earth fine cloth was quoted at 160 yuan, and Dapeng at 148 yuan, but there were few transactions.

### Yarn Factories Absorbing Large Mouth Iron

Yesterday, the metal market still did not have a lively atmosphere. Except for large mouth iron, there were few transactions in other metal products. The reason for the consumption of 26-gauge large mouth iron was that the yarn factories in this street used it to make rollers. Since the day before yesterday, they had been searching for it diligently. In the end, the price was 120 yuan per sheet, and only about 40 sheets were purchased. The inventory of this type of large mouth iron in this city is only a few cases (each case contains 50 or 56 sheets). Therefore, the holders were unwilling to sell all of the only two or three cases of spot goods, so they held on to the price. They were only willing to sell a dozen or so sheets. However, on the one hand, the yarn factory needed the rollers urgently, so they suffered from the inability to buy the goods even with money, and on the other hand, there was a phenomenon of no goods available on the market. The thinness of the market goods and the good trend are evident.

The Woolen Fabric Market in the Hot Summer

Now, in the middle of the hot summer, the woolen fabric market has historically been in a sluggish state. This summer is especially so. Due to the special environment and the changes in current events, the market situation is very different. Retail sales are even lower, traders have stopped pre-purchasing, hoarders have disappeared, and customer sales are not rising. The prices, which have been rising all the way since 1927, are now falling one after another. Even with the decline, there are still few buyers, which shows that the woolen fabric business has turned from prosperity to decline.

### Bean Cake Inventory Decreases

The bean market had only sporadic transactions yesterday, and the market trend was rather quiet. Qingdao mung beans traded at 230 yuan for 20 bags, and Xiding white broad beans traded at 158 yuan for 15 bags.

The supply and demand of sweet potato chips were both half, and the price did not change. Jiangbei sweet potato chips traded at 105 yuan per bag.

Bean cake inventory decreased, but actual sales were also limited, so the market was stable. Yesterday, Shenji bean cake for February traded at 61 yuan for 500 pieces of Wangu Stock, and for April traded at 62 yuan for 1,000 pieces.

Yesterday, wheat bran was scarce and expensive. Sanxin small bag wheat bran for May traded at 98 yuan for 300 bags, an increase of 3 yuan compared to the previous day.

### Dried Scallops Rise

Recently, both the arrival and inventory of dried scallops have been scarce, and consumption is still active. In addition, the production price continues to rise, which is the fundamental reason for the rise. Yesterday's market price for round medium-grain dried scallops was 3,400 yuan to 3,500 yuan, and for triangular dried scallops, it was 3,200 yuan, an increase of 100 yuan compared to the previous day. The market trend was stable.

### Honeysuckle Market Flat

There has been no continuous arrival of honeysuckle recently, and no new goods have been opened. However, the market trend has flattened because the flow in all directions has gradually become normal. Yesterday, the higher market price was 1,400 yuan, and the next highest was 1,300 yuan.

### Old Knife Brand Cigarettes Widely Sought After

The cigarette market suddenly became tight because the silver and money gangs were sparing no effort in searching for cigarettes. The most notable was the Old Knife brand, so the price was good. The selling price of Japanese cigarettes turned from rising to flat, showing a temporary break, but the trend was still easy to rise and difficult to fall. The trading price for Great Britain Brand was 8,400 yuan, Old Knife Brand was 5,510 yuan, Pin Hai Brand was 4,900 yuan, and Wuhua Brand was 3,600 yuan, all up 200 yuan. Little Fairy Brand rose 100 yuan. The prices of Japanese cigarettes initially weakened and then strengthened, such as Golden Gun Brand at 1,670 yuan, which returned to 1,700 yuan, Golden Building Brand at 1,950 yuan, Red Rose at 1,300 yuan, Quanlu Brand at 1,850 yuan, Nianzhi at 1,880 yuan, and Guide Brand at 1,450 yuan, with prices rising and falling compared to the previous day. The base of domestic cigarettes was still good, with Golden Mouse Brand at 1,800 yuan, Beauty Brand at 3,000 yuan, and Pyramid Brand at 3,200 yuan, continuing to rise by 100 yuan.

### Some Thoughts on This Year's Scholarship

— Month

The details of this newspaper's third scholarship have been generally reported. Here, we want to share some thoughts.

Although the process of conducting the identification examination was cumbersome this time, we obtained a lot of valuable material. All of the test questions will be released after the approved list is announced for the reference of students in various schools. During the identification examination, the order was very good. If the general students in the school have such a good academic atmosphere, we should be fortunate. The facts may not be entirely true, but what can be proven is that "poor and excellent" is a fact. We dare not predict the performance of wealthy children in school examinations, but their solemn spirit should be comparable.

In the middle school common sense section of the test questions, the number of people and grains in the third phase of household registration was used as one of the tests. Although this seems to be an ordinary test, it is a powerful piece of evidence for our investigation of students' family situations. In other words, if a student's answer is very far from the actual situation, their family may not be very poor. In addition, there are also tests on hygiene. Our intention is to hope that although the students are poor, they should pay attention to the nutrition of their food.

Judging from the general examination situation, the scores recorded by each school seem to have different degrees of strictness. According to more reliable standards, students from schools that are stricter in handling the exams can achieve outstanding results, and few fail. On the contrary, the percentage of passing students in schools with lower curricula and looser management will naturally decrease. Moreover, schools with higher tuition fees are not necessarily schools with strict management. These facts show that we have learned a lot from our scholarship work. At the same time, it may also be of some help to the teaching of various schools in the future.

There are many good compositions from the students, but we are not satisfied with the general level. We feel that many of the students' compositions lack substance. "My Reading Experience" and "My Summer Life" - these topics should have concrete points, rather than more discussion than facts. Useful writing cannot be separated from facts. Writing that is separated from facts is not worth paying attention to, nor is it what we hope from the students.

The result of the test is the list of approved scholarship recipients. Among them, some students passed the exam, but their family economy is still manageable, so they were not approved in order to ensure the purpose of the scholarship. There are also students whose families are very poor, even assisting with chores after school and having no time to study on their own. Considering the circumstances, corresponding assistance was provided. In other words, only poor and excellent students meet the scholarship criteria. Excellent but not very poor students should be excluded. We hope that when the next scholarship is held, non-poor students do not need to apply. If all poor students are excellent, although the amount of the scholarship may not be enough to meet the requests of the applicants, we are confident that those who donate from all walks of life will be able to do their best to make up for this deficiency.

Personalities

### Gandhi - The Soul of India

— Hu Bei

In order to lead the active independence movement of India, Gandhi, that short, thin, brown-skinned person wrapped in a piece of homespun cloth, that Mahatma, and other leaders of the Indian independence movement, have once again been arrested by the British government. This eccentric seventy-one-year-old man knows that this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity will vanish in an instant, so he is willing to risk his old life to fight for the liberation and freedom of his 350 million oppressed compatriots. The future destiny of India will largely be determined by this event.

The Idol of the Masses

In India, Gandhi has long been an idol of the masses. In thousands upon thousands of simple huts, hanging his portrait is considered an honor. When children are sick, and anxious adults are at their wits' end, they use Gandhi's photo to represent good medicine, hoping it will heal them. Wherever his train passes, farmers travel dozens of miles to wait respectfully by the railway, even though the train does not stop and Gandhi will not come out to greet them, they are still willing to do so. When he is about to give a speech, thousands of listeners arrive the night before to occupy good seats. Everywhere he goes, farmers compete to kneel down and kiss the ground where he has stepped. It can be said that all of India is obsessed with Gandhi.

The two words "Gandhi" in Indian mean "grocer." The Indian people, to worship him, respect him as a "Mahatma," which means "great soul." Many people close to him call him "Bapu," which means father. In his early years, his family called him "Bhai," which means brother. Still others call him "Gandhiji," the character "ji" meaning mister, but with a sense of affection. As for those in the organization, they often call him their "supreme commander."

Non-violent Resistance

Gandhi advocated non-violent resistance in his early years. This is a non-cooperation movement. Many people misunderstand it as non-resistance, which is a huge mistake, because non-resistance and non-violent resistance are vastly different. His instructions to participants in non-violent resistance are: do not get angry, do not insult, do not resist when attacked, surrender when arrested, and never insult the enemy. He even wants his disciples to help British soldiers and police who are attacked by Indians who disobey orders. He hates violence, and he also hates meeting violence with violence, but he believes that there is something worse than violence, and that is cowardice.

In order to launch this unprecedented non-violent disobedience movement, he was repeatedly arrested and imprisoned. Even he himself says he can't remember how many times he has been imprisoned and how many days he has spent in prison. In his early years, when he was a lawyer in South Africa, he was arrested and imprisoned three times. In 1922, when he was arrested and tried for launching the non-cooperation movement, he asked the judge with the utmost sincerity to impose the heaviest penalty, believing that unless he did so, he would not be able to atone for his sins. When the judge read out the verdict, he stood up to express his respect for the prisoner, sentencing him to six years in prison. Upon hearing the sentence, Gandhi politely expressed his thanks to the judge. Such a scene of courteousness in court can be said to be rare in the world. In fact, Gandhi showed no fear or unwillingness towards imprisonment, and it can be said that he regarded imprisonment as commonplace. Usually, his affairs are complex and numerous, and imprisonment is his only opportunity to rest and write. He himself said that he was "as happy as a bird" in prison.

The Meaning of Fasting

Speaking of Gandhi's imprisonment, one naturally has to mention his fasting. Because every time he encounters something he considers unfortunate, he always expresses his repentance by fasting. The British government is particularly troubled by Gandhi's fasting, because every time he fasts in prison, it always attracts worldwide attention. Towards the end of the fast, because his body is weakened, the British government always has to release him to avoid a major incident from happening. Because the British government knows that Gandhi cannot die, especially not in a British prison; otherwise, all of India will fall into an uncontrollable state. In 1921, on one occasion, while implementing non-violent resistance, the masses lost control and attacked and burned British police officers. Gandhi was heartbroken upon hearing this, calling the incident "a Himalayan blunder," and immediately stopped the non-cooperation movement and held his first major fast to express his repentance. In 1925, because of a major conflict between Indian and Muslim believers, Gandhi fasted for twenty-one days to promote awareness on both sides, almost fatally. On the last day, he only drank a little orange juice and was so weak that he could barely speak. Later, he once again fasted for twenty-one days for the lowest class of people in India. On another occasion, it is said that because one of his female disciples had an affair with twenty-one comrades, and he discovered it, he was truly heartbroken. As a result, in addition to expelling the female disciple and the twenty-one comrades, he himself fasted for twenty-one days to show his repentance for the twenty-two people. Some say that if that female disciple had had affairs with a few more people, Gandhi might have been in danger of fasting to death.

Vegetarian

Influenced by Hinduism, Gandhi was a vegetarian from an early age. When he was studying law in London, he was already a member of the executive committee of the London Vegetarian Society. It is said that when he was young, a friend told him that the British were strong because they ate meat, and the Indians were weak perhaps because they were vegetarians. Therefore, he decided to use himself as an experimental subject, ate a meal of mutton, and as a result, he felt sick in his heart and was disturbed by nightmares that night, dreaming that a live sheep was constantly bleating in his stomach. From then on, he dared not eat meat again, and hated it like an enemy.

Although Gandhi is a vegetarian and fasts at the drop of a hat, in fact, his appetite is not small. Each meal he eats includes a cup of goat's milk, a spoonful of honey, and also dates, nuts, garlic, oranges, jackfruit, mangoes, peaches, and other things. Usually, goat's milk is his main food. After sunset, he does not eat salt, tea, or meals.

Devout Believer

Gandhi is a devout believer and prays every morning and evening. Sometimes at any meeting, as long as he thinks the time has come, he ignores everything else, sits on the ground, and begins his prayer. In the air of the British House of Commons committee, this reckless behavior of his once caused great surprise to British gentlemen. Monday is his routine day of silence, no matter what important events occur, he always keeps his mouth shut and never wavers. But if you want to ask what religion Gandhi believes in, I'm afraid no one can say. I think it's better to let him express it in his own words. He said: "I see all things around me constantly changing, constantly dying. Under all the changes, there is a living force that does not change, organizing everything, creating everything, and dissolving everything. That force that gives everything life and dominion is God. I believe God is holy and benevolent, because I can see that in the midst of death, life is still eternal; in the midst of dishonesty, truth continues; in the midst of darkness, light continues to persist. Therefore, I infer that God is life, truth, and light. God is love, is supreme good." He is a devout Hindu, but he believes that all the great scriptures of the world are equally the word of God.

What Gandhi loves most are children, fresh air, laughter, friends, and truth. What he hates most is lying.

Reduce oneself to Zero

Gandhi has a very long autobiography. After writing one thousand and ninety pages, his last sentence is: "I must reduce myself to zero." The seeds of all the flowers, grasses, grains, and other plants in the world must "reduce themselves to zero" before new life can grow and before there can be a bountiful harvest. In this key moment of success or failure in the Indian independence movement, the last sentence in Gandhi's autobiography is especially worthy of savoring.

### Sleep Skill

— Tang Mu

Gandhi has a special skill: he can fall asleep within thirty seconds of getting on a train, and he can say before going to sleep that he wants to take a nap for twenty-five minutes, and wake up exactly at twenty-five minutes. This kind of skill cannot be achieved without extremely deep cultivation.

### The Chatterbox

### Weaver Girl of the Milky Way

— Lü Huanxun

Three Thousand Feet of White Silk

After completing half a month of day shifts, it was time to take the night shift as usual. Out at sunset and rest at sunrise, the long twelve hours were enough to make you cry out, "How long is the night?" Before twelve o'clock, the partners were always energetic and did not take a break; but after midnight, it was actually the next morning, especially from two to five o'clock in the morning, every companion showed signs of fatigue. The eyes were the most unbearable. It's no wonder, under the dazzling electric lights, squeezing their eyeballs, paying attention to every fine thread, half a strand of hair, breaking, knotting, escaping, finding, without a moment's negligence. Some companions closed their eyelids and dozed off, which was really funny. When the weft was finished, she didn't know, or when a hole was made, she still didn't know; when she discovered it, she had to admit her bad luck and remove the flawed shuttle, and these wasted hours were a loss of income, the price of dozing. Several experienced people were different, they were very alert and could wake up at the moment when the weft was about to finish, without any accident. Even more people wanted to avoid dozing off, cheer up, raised their voices, and chanted along with the rhythm of the loom: some joked with the partners next to the machine, and actually talked and laughed, driving away the doze demon. And I often stared blankly at this never-ending warbler, couldn't help but shout, "For whom are you working so hard?"

"Three thousand feet of white silk" can probably be completed in a year. If there is a weaver girl with three or four years of history, she will have at least ten thousand feet of achievements. Assuming that the length of each piece of clothing material is one foot, then she has made ten thousand pieces of clothing material for the world. Of course, the clothes of ten thousand people are woven by her hand, thread by thread.

"A song of barbarian song, a piece of silk from the East, the beauty still dislikes it lightly, do you know that under the cold window of the weaver girl, how much effort it takes to weave it?" This is a poem of indignation written by an ancient weaver girl. Naturally, the rich wives and young ladies change clothes in the morning and evening, and the wardrobe is full of dazzling things. As long as they enjoy comfort, how can they know that every thread is the blood and tears of the weaver girls?

The general situation of the lives of weaver girls has already been said. Finally, I still have a little feeling: the silk weaving industry in China has the longest history. Although it is much more advanced than the hand weaving industry in the past, compared with other countries in the world, it is really inferior and insignificant. The Soviet Union has a large factory with 25,000 looms, which China does not have at all. Up to now, silk merchants still use goods transported from Europe and the United States as their selling point, which should be considered a disgrace by all Chinese silk weaving employees. Every one of us employees should bury our heads in hard work, strive for perfection, and seek to wash away our shame, and at the same time, for the revitalization of our industry, especially for the leaders with status and strength in the silk weaving industry, we place deep hope. (The End)

### Sharing the Same Boat Through Storms

— He Jia Zhi

(8) What Can Be Done?

This evening, Mrs. Ye Er was also lying in bed, perked up her ears, and waited until dawn before she fell asleep groggily. This was another day, and no one went to disturb Mrs. Ye Er, but Mrs. Ye Er suddenly woke up. Waking up, she called out, "Weicheng, come here, why was Miss Chen crying to you?" Cui Zhen had just walked outside the room, and was surprised when she heard it. She walked in to take a look, only Mrs. Ye Er was alone, speaking with sleepy eyes. Cui Zhen smiled and said, "Second Aunt, Brother Cheng hasn't come back yet. Are you saying that because he's back?" Mrs. Ye Er was stunned, and forced a smile, "I was dreaming, it was like Weicheng was telling me that Miss Chen was crying to him. It turned out to be a dream. Has Weicheng come back after all? Has the snow melted? Has the weather cleared?" Cui Zhen answered her one by one, and she was worried again, saying, "Why didn't I think of calling He Ziyu to run to Shuangqiao yesterday? He Zixing went, and there would have been solid news early today."

Cui Zhen was still able to think of things that others couldn't think of. She had already sent He Zixing to Shuangqiao this morning; in He Zixing's eyes, what Cui Zhen's position was in the Ye family, he didn't know as well as Cui Zhen, but He Zixing was very obedient, and he went when Cui Zhen wanted him to go. So when Mrs. Ye Er regretted it, Cui Zhen truthfully reported it to her.

It was like yesterday again, suddenly it was noon, suddenly it was evening. In the cold days and short days, Mrs. Ye Er and Cui Zhen always felt like they were living like years. By evening, Weicheng and A Xing hadn't returned, but He Zixing had returned. Although he was a farmhand, he was standing on the line of employment, but when he reached outside the fence, Mrs. Ye Er and others greeted him. Only the mud on He Zixing's feet, splashed above his calves, showed the results of his hard work. When he saw the mistress, he said, "Neither the young master nor A Yu are at the Chen family in Shuangqiao." (153)

### Gandhi's Weight

— Jia Ji

Once, Gandhi's body was weakened by fasting, and his weight was reduced to ninety-seven pounds. The doctor instructed him to eat twice as much food so that his weight would increase to one hundred and four pounds. After considering it, Gandhi refused the doctor's suggestion to increase his food intake, but told the doctor that he had decided to increase his weight to one hundred and four pounds in a week. In a week, his weight did increase as planned, and the doctor was amazed.
