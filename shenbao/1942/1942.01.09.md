Dutch East Indies Prepares for Scorched Earth Policy

Panama City, 7th (German News Agency wire) – The newly appointed Deputy Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies, Mook, stated today in Canberra that the Dutch East Indies has been preparing a scorched earth policy for the past twelve months. To prevent oil fields and factories from falling into Japanese hands, the Dutch East Indies government has relocated factories to more suitable locations and is preparing to dismantle factories in threatened areas. Those that cannot be relocated will be destroyed. At the same time, if the Japanese army arrives, the oil fields will be set on fire. However, Mook pointed out that this measure will only be effective temporarily, as the Japanese army will eventually be able to find the location of the oil wells.

### Soviet Forces Capture Two Footholds in Crimea; German Air Force Bombs Black Sea Transportation Lines

Berlin, 8th (Shanghai News Agency wire) – Yesterday, those responsible for the German forces issued the following supplementary war report to the Shanghai News Agency reporter, saying that Soviet forces attempted to break into the Crimean Peninsula from land to relieve the siege of the Soviet forces there, but have not succeeded. Although the Soviet forces have gained footholds in Kerch and Feodosia after losing many warships, transport ships, and attack boats, several attacks have been repelled by German artillery fire. A small Soviet force landed southwest of Feodosia and was routed by Romanian troops. Near Eupatoria, north of Sevastopol, Soviet forces also landed under the protection of warships but made no progress. Fierce fighting broke out with German forces, and many were annihilated by us. A small number were captured by our troops. The German Air Force also assisted the army in combat, bombing the landing Soviet troops and transportation routes on the Black Sea with great effect. Enemy reinforcements have encountered extreme difficulties because they must travel by sea. At the same time, the loss of Soviet transport ships is increasing daily, so the reinforcement strength in Crimea has gradually become weaker. The enemy forces in the central and northern sections of the eastern front have also attempted to attack. Since Christmas, Soviet forces have attacked German-held positions almost daily, but have not succeeded. Even if the Soviet forces were able to break through German positions, they were all recovered by counterattacks. The Soviet forces suffered heavy casualties and heavy losses of military supplies, but the attempt to break through the German positions ultimately failed.

Moscow, 6th (Reuters wire, according to Chongqing Broadcasting) – Last night's Soviet communiqué stated that on the evening of the 7th, our forces were still pressing the enemy forces to retreat westward in various places on the front line. Our forces continued to advance, and the German forces suffered heavy casualties in the recapture of Makiyivka and other places.

Braun has long been considered one of the best generals in the German army. During the Battle of France, he served as commander of an infantry division and made many achievements in the Meuse River region. After the outbreak of the Soviet war, his unit was the first to be transferred to the front line, first breaking through the Red Army's positions in the Lviv region, and then forcibly crossing the Dnieper River south of Kyiv, and participating in the battles of Poltava and Kharkov.

Berlin, 8th (Shanghai News Agency wire) – According to a spokesman for the German Ministry, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov’s note claiming that German soldiers committed atrocities in the Soviet Union is "completely inconsistent with the facts."

### Rice and Grain Office to Increase Supply of Warehouse Rice for Price Stabilization Starting Tomorrow; Hundreds of Rice Shops to Close Tonight

One Hundred Plus Noodle Shops and Others to Be Penalized

Since the Bureau of Public Works restricted the operation of rice shops and announced which rice shops were permitted to exist and which were to be closed by a deadline, according to a report by the Datong News Agency yesterday, the remaining rice shops that were not among the 250 shops permitted to exist have been settling their accounts and preparing to close. Starting at 4:00 PM on the 9th, they can all comply with the Bureau of Public Works' regulations and cease operations. The business licenses for 1942 will be revoked by the Bureau of Public Works.

Finger Dyeing to Prevent Repeated Purchases

Starting on the 10th of this month, rice shops can apply to the Bureau of Public Works for more funds to increase the supply of rice for retail sales. In addition to the sales methods, which will be divided into two groups for retail sales, the Bureau of Public Works will also provide a chemical dye to each rice shop to prevent individuals from repeatedly purchasing rice. When issuing price-stabilized rice for retail sale, the finger of the purchaser should be dipped into the dye. Because of the chemical reaction, the dye will not fade from the finger on the same day. This will prevent people from repeatedly purchasing rice in small quantities. This method is expected to be implemented on a trial basis starting around the 10th. As the Bureau of Public Works can supply a large quantity of foreign rice, the crowded conditions will naturally disappear, and the method of queuing and numbering can be lifted without any action.

Shanghai-Feng Warehouse Unsealed Yesterday

According to a report by the Datong News Agency, another rice warehouse that had been sealed was unsealed yesterday. The warehouse is the Shanghai-Feng Warehouse located at No. 1 West Su Road. The rice released from the warehouse yesterday was still based on the transportation permit issued by the Rice and Grain Office of the Bureau of Public Works the day before. Together with the Chinese Roosevelt and Mao Tai warehouses, the total amount of rice released was about 4,000 bags. Other warehouses will also be unsealed successively in the near future. The Rice and Grain Office did not issue the transportation permits to the applying rice shops yesterday because the stamping procedures for the foreign rice transportation permits approved the day before were not completed as scheduled. The reason for the delay is likely related to the large-scale supply to 250 rice shops starting on the 10th of this month. It is necessary to plan everything in advance to ensure an adequate supply.

Relief Needed for Rice Shop Employees

It is heard that the Rice Shop Trade Association of this city, at the request of all its members, will soon apply to the Rice Management Committee of the Bureau of Public Works for permission to establish alternative measures to prevent employees of closed rice shops from suffering unemployment. According to a person in charge of the Rice Shop Association yesterday, each rice shop in this city employs an average of about seven employees.

Punishment Campaign for Refusal to Sell Food

The Bureau of Public Works has launched a punishment campaign against flour shops, steamed bun shops, and noodle shops that refuse to sell or sell at prices higher than the limited price. Starting next week, about 110 of these shops will be ordered to close or be fined unless they can provide sufficient reasons to avoid punishment. The Bureau of Public Works has just launched this campaign, and two noodle shops and one bakery have already been fined hundreds of dollars or ordered to close for three days.

Evidence Found of Shops Disobeying Orders

The authorities have also sent letters to 60 noodle shops and 25 flour and steamed bun shops each, stating that the authorities have found evidence of these shops refusing to sell or selling at prices higher than the limit after a week of investigation. Unless these shops provide sufficient reasons that are satisfactory to the Bureau of Public Works, they will be ordered to close or be fined starting next week. The Bureau of Public Works had repeatedly urged these shops to purchase flour from the Bureau, and now that conclusive evidence has been found, the Bureau of Public Works believes that all these shops will likely be punished.

Crackdown on Black Market Urgently Needed

The authorities will also take the same punitive measures against shops that refuse to sell or sell at prices higher than the limit. There is an ample supply of flour in this city. If vendors purchase flour from the Bureau of Public Works, the Bureau will immediately inform them of the location where they can purchase the flour. The price has already been set by the Bureau. The reason why many shops sell at prices higher than the limit is that they purchase flour at expensive black market prices.

Holders of the voucher can go to the Salvation Army's beggar shelter on Singapore Road to receive a set of cotton clothing. This is a temporary measure of last resort, as it is impossible to implement large-scale relief at the moment. The beggar shelter is also full and difficult to expand. However, beggars who have been living there for a long time are being given money and sent back to their hometowns to make room for new beggars. The Salvation Army's annual fundraising campaign will begin on the first of next month, with a target of 200,000 yuan. According to unofficial sources, more than 10,000 people have died on the streets since the beginning of winter.

### Four Charcoal-Powered Cars Now in Operation

The restrictions are that applicants for gasoline car driving permits must submit them to the Special Committee of the French Police Department for approval, while applicants for charcoal car permits must submit them to a technician for inspection of the charcoal car for a decision.

### French Tram Ticket Inspectors to Prevent Graft and Corruption

Since the French Concession tram and bus companies have reduced the number of stops by 19, citizens have felt more inconvenienced. It is learned that in order to prevent ticket inspectors from taking bribes and drivers from driving beyond the stops, which would cause more suffering for citizens, the French tram company has dispatched several senior French ticket inspectors. Their duties are to supervise other ticket inspectors in the performance of their duties, to investigate ticket sales and bribery, and to observe whether drivers have driven past designated stops without stopping. If an employee is found to have committed any of the above-mentioned faults, the company authorities will be notified and the employee will be suspended for four days and given a demerit. It is hoped that this will reduce the public's negative impression of public transportation employees.

Also, Public Bus Route 7 has now been cancelled, and Route 17 has also been cancelled. The number of Route 9 and Route 2 buses running daily has been reduced by more than ten.

### Beware of Coal Gas Poisoning; Avoid Closing Doors and Windows and Moving the Coal Stove Indoors

In recent days, the weather has turned colder than before the winter solstice. Most poor citizens with limited economic resources are unable to afford to make cotton-padded clothes and quilts to protect against the cold. In order to keep warm indoors, most people move their coal stoves indoors when cooking. They only know how to keep warm and do not know the danger of coal gas poisoning. Yesterday morning, a Chen couple (small bread vendors) living in the kitchen of No. 23 Rihui Lane, Dapu Bridge, closed the doors and windows tightly and cooked indoors, and were poisoned by coal gas and fainted. Fortunately, their landlord discovered them and used cold water to wake them up after about ten minutes.

At 2:15 AM yesterday, Wang Yuezhang (26 years old), the owner of a pancake shop at No. 651 Henan Road, moved a coal briquette stove to the attic with his companions to get fire before going to bed the night before. As a result, he was poisoned by coal gas and fell into a coma. Wang and his relatives Wang Jinben (21 years old) and Kuang Shuyu, who discovered him, were also poisoned at the same time. They urgently called an ambulance and were sent to Tongren Hospital for treatment. It is said that there was no danger to their lives.

### Continuous Price Increases for Cigarettes to Be Sanctioned; Bureau of Public Works Willing to Assist

Yesterday, a senior official of the Bureau of Public Works urged cigarette importers to take appropriate action to curb the continued price increases of various cigarettes that are not listed in the Bureau's price limit list. He said that the Bureau of Public Works will certainly assist in this action. The Bureau of Public Works itself has not taken any action on cigarettes, as the Bureau considers the cigarette problem to be secondary to the flour and rice problem. The Bureau of Public Works is now focusing on dealing with essential goods such as rice and grain.

### Banks Under Liquidation To Expedite Transactions

Liquidation Plan Seems Not Yet Finalized Payments May Resume Within the Next Week

After the Japanese authorities announced the liquidation of foreign banks such as British and American banks in this city, the liquidators appointed by the Japanese side went to the various banks yesterday morning, and were introduced to the managers of the banks by Japanese supervisors, and then began to inquire about the status and various issues of these banks. It is expected that the liquidators will continue to inquire for two days, and then meet to decide on a liquidation plan.

Closed for Business Yesterday

The Shanghai branches of the British, Dutch, and Belgian banks were ordered to close their doors yesterday morning and will reopen next Monday. The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation posted a notice on the door along the Bund, stating that it was ordered to liquidate by the Japanese Navy, and therefore would be closed for four days. Other Allied banks also posted similar notices. The Japanese side has of course carefully considered various methods of liquidating the banks of the Allied countries, but the liquidation plan does not yet seem to be finalized. Bankers believe that the Japanese liquidators only have three days to agree on a precise plan, and the time is quite short. Therefore, a precise liquidation plan may not be agreed upon by Monday of next week.

Meaning of Liquidation

According to bank lawyers, liquidation means that the banks of the Allied countries must of course cease operations, but it does not necessarily mean that the banks will be immediately closed or confiscated. The most appropriate interpretation of the Japanese liquidation order, which is generally believed by bankers in this city, is that the banks of the Allied countries must not engage in any new transactions, and must expedite the completion of outstanding transactions as much as possible, and close personal accounts by paying cash. Small depositors probably do not need to worry, as the banks of the Allied countries are allowed to reopen on Monday, and will resume paying cash to depositors starting at 10:00 AM next Monday to those who had paid cash up to yesterday.

### Five Robbery Gang Members Arrested; Wax Replica Handguns Confiscated

Detective Xue Youwen and other detectives from the Old Zha Police Station learned that a robbery gang was hiding in Room 6X of the Pingjiang Hotel at No. 16, Lane 588, Hankou Road, intending to conspire to rob. At about 6:00 PM the day before, they secretly went to the address and arrested nine people from Jiangbei, including Yu Youqing, Wang Xiaoguan, Sun Denghan, Zhang Jinhe, and Zhang Gensheng, and confiscated two wax replica handguns, which were taken to the police station and detained. They were escorted to the First Criminal Court of the Special First District Court yesterday morning. The police station lawyer, Ru Baohui, requested a postponement. After questioning, Judge Feng ordered them to be detained pending further investigation and verification.

### Fire in Pingliang Road Destroys Five Straw Huts

At around 9:30 AM yesterday, a fire broke out suddenly in a straw hut on Pingliang Road (near Meizhou Road) in East Shanghai. Due to the dry weather, the fire quickly broke through the roof and spread to the neighboring houses. The fire brigade received the report and rushed to the scene to put out the fire. It was extinguished at around 12:00 PM. It is estimated that four or five straw huts were burned down, and part of the roof of a nearby bungalow was also affected. However, no one was injured.

### Russian Commits Suicide Out of World-Weariness

A Russian resident of No. 186 Nanyang Road in the Public Concession suddenly had thoughts of world-weariness recently. At around 1:30 AM yesterday morning, he suddenly shot himself in the chest with a handgun in his room. The bullet pierced his chest and exited through his back, causing serious injuries and causing him to fall to the ground bleeding profusely and barely alive. After being discovered by his family, they immediately reported the matter to the police station, who took the injured man to the Hong'en Hospital on Great Western Road for treatment. It is reported that his life is in critical condition.

### Population Survey in Hongkou

According to yesterday's Continental News, at the end of last year, the total number of Japanese residents in the Hongkou, Yangshupu, and Huishan districts was 91,709, and the total number of Chinese residents in the same area was 907,386.

Their strength is not weak. China One was originally a strong team in Group B. They are competing in Group A this year. The young players are working hard and have posed a major threat to their opponents in both games against Giant and Lianxing. The game against Lianxing was even more intense. Therefore, their fighting power is surprising. Their game against Fudan tonight can be said to be evenly matched. It is difficult to predict who will win.

### Gold Prices Plunge

Yesterday, the spot gold market saw scattered purchases by retail investors, resulting in a unified price. The situation showed a renewed decline, with prices falling below $12,000. Due to certain unfavorable speculations, market sentiment was soft. From the morning, the price opened $200 lower per tael (ten liang), at $12,100. A certain gold shop and silver shop bought in, immediately raising the price by $150, to a high of $12,250, but only five taels were traded. When cash shops, securities firms, and money changers sold off, the price was immediately pushed down by $500, falling to $11,750. A certain gold shop then started buying again, raising the price to $12,100. Cash shops then started selling again, pushing the price down again. A low of $11,700 was traded for five taels.

### Late Rice Market Rebounds

Yesterday, the supply of domestic rice remained scarce, with a total of only 130 to 140 shi of both thick and thin japonica rice. Therefore, sellers were reluctant to lower prices, and asking prices continued to rise. The number of shops taking delivery decreased. In addition to the 150 stores that the authorities had announced would continue to operate, the remaining 310 were in the process of closing. Moreover, the government's sale of foreign rice was being widely promoted. As a result, trading in domestic rice throughout the city was very quiet. However, the price of thin indica rice, which opened in the morning, was actually half a dollar weaker than the previous market, selling for only $206.50. Until later in the market, when the goods were almost sold out, late-arriving customers successively sought to replenish their needs, and it was felt that supply was insufficient. The selling price rebounded to $208. Early rice was similar, also selling for $207 to $206. As a result, there was not much change compared to the previous market. As for thick japonica rice, it remained quite popular due to its scarcity. Kunshan high-quality hard rice was priced at $230, and $229.50. Ordinary white japonica rice was at $226, showing a slight increase of $2 to $3. In addition, there were only some Yinyuan stones, selling for $208 and $207.50. Foreign rice had no trading in the environment of government rice price controls and universal distribution. It is not known whether the cheap rice from Nan City has arrived, but if it can be sold as usual in the shortest possible time, the food for the urban poor will depend on it.

### Talk of Government Control of Grains

Trading in miscellaneous grains was quite quiet yesterday. This was due to rumors that items such as soybeans and corn would also be subject to government control, causing both supply and demand to take a wait-and-see approach. Only 50 bags of Tianjin green beans were traded under government control, priced at $98. 300 bags of Dutch white corn were traded, priced at $53. 300 bags of Saigon new corn were traded, priced at $54.50 to $53.50. Also, 25 tons of Anhua Si spot goods were traded, priced at $92. It was also heard that there was some trading in cooking oil outside the market. The price of Jiangbei peanut oil was $385. Dayou Factory's clear oil was $267. Rihua Factory's rapeseed oil was $275. It is expected that the new measures for government control of cooking oil will be announced early next week, so that operators can resume business.

### Japanese Yarn is Uniquely Strong

The cotton yarn market continued to rise, but the momentum remained stable. This was because the gold market was also on a horizontal line. At the same time, although the sales of spot yarn were not very enthusiastic, retail transactions in this street could still be maintained, and Japanese yarn accounted for the majority. As for the goods stored in various bank warehouses, they will soon be released, so people are interested. The opening price of 20-count Double Horse brand yarn was $2,165. Subsequently, due to strong buying and weak supply, the situation became stronger and gradually rose to $2,210. By the time of closing, some profit-takers sold off, and the price was weak again, returning to $2,165 at closing, with not much difference from the price of the previous day. 42-count Blue Phoenix was $4,170 to $4,130. 20-count Yueqin was $2,330 to $2,350. 20-count Fengnian was $2,678. 20-count Red Kuixing was $2,240. 20-count Tiannv was $2,670 to $2,660. 20-count Double Globe was $2,040. 20-count Double Horse spot was $2,255 to $2,240. 16-count Red Kuixing was $1,880. 20-count Wufu was $2,000. 18-count Weaver Girl was $1,980. 16-count Golden Bridge was $2,060. 10-count Red Double Horse was $1,600. 6-count Red Daxie was $1,625.

### Cloth Market is Firm

The cloth market continued to be firm yesterday. Selling prices increased due to the scarcity of spot goods. As a result, Huadie coarse cloth was $114, 13-pound Flying Bear was $85, 11-pound Three Rabbits was $78, and 9-pound was $68, an increase of $1.50 to $4 per bolt. Fugui fine cloth was $87.50, and Dapeng was $88, an increase of $1. Dyed cloth of various brands was in short supply, and also increased by $2 to $3. More than 300 pieces were traded in this street. Procurement from Zhejiang East and Jiangzhe coastal ports was frequent, about 200 pieces.

Eastern cloth initially rose and then fell, and the market was calm. The factory price for 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth opened at $90.50, rising to $91. At noon, it fell to $89.25 due to the sale of goods by peers. There was not much trading in the afternoon, and the price also stabilized. Zhongdang Caiqiu Flying Fish Yanghe Horn was offered at $85.50. More than 200 pieces were traded throughout the day. Fine cloth fell by about $0.50 per bolt. The morning high for Four Gentlemen Serge was $3.295, and the low was $3.215. The noon closing was $3.23, and the evening closing was $3.235, a decrease of about 3 cents per yard. Five boxes of Four Gentlemen Zhigong spot goods were traded, priced at $3.75. Four Gentlemen Shilin traded at $170, and Happy Crane Shilin traded at $168, the goods were the most popular.

### Sugar Sales Remain Sparse

The sugar market has recently seen only sparse demand from this street, which is only a slight embellishment. Selling prices have not fluctuated much. 24 coarse white is $240, Dutch red is $265, Taikoo B-mark car white is $280, Father CC car ice is $300, and the factory price for No. 1 cotton white is $260. The factory price for No. 1 rock sugar has been opened at $330.

Anecdotes

### Famous Erhu Player Gone: Another One Weakened – Mu Tiefen Dies of Illness in Tianjin

— By Bing Jiu

Yesterday, I received a letter from Zhang Guoyun from Tianjin: I was shocked to learn that the famous qin player Mu Tiefen suddenly died of cerebral hemorrhage a few days ago in his Tianjin residence. Each family of stringed instruments lost another one, which is a great loss to the art world.

Mu Tiefen was a Manchu, originally surnamed Hu, but changed his surname to Mu for his stage name. He learned qin art from Xi Zigang at a young age, and his hand sound was excellent. As soon as he graduated, he immediately showed his talent. He first accompanied Cheng Yanqiu, and then assisted Zhang Eyun. He had a special talent for playing Cheng's style, and the subtle sounds he played were particularly beautiful. Moreover, his voice was tight, and he was a good match. His brilliance was not exposed, and his taste was mellow. The size of the activities was in line with the rhythm, and the sound was not separated from the music theory; the wonderful hand came, seamless, and was a person after Mei Sun. The style of his qin art is to see the effort in the plain, the rules are simple and unpretentious, and even the flower points are extremely ordinary. He used the middle and index fingers when playing erhuang, and used the wrapping string to play the duluo, etc., which were all special marks on his technique. When Sun Zuochen was in Japan, he praised Tiefen's qin art as being clumsy but clever, which is really a knowing word.

Tiefen has assisted Zhu Chen in playing the strings for many years, living in the same house, and has never left for a day. Most of Eyun's Cheng style was taught by Tiefen, just like Yan Heng assisted Ju Peng. He only liked to drink in his life. He had a stroke a few years ago, but the symptoms were mild and he was able to recover. After that, he broke off with noodles and vowed not to touch his lips again. Unexpectedly, this time he still died of the same disease, which is also a fate. Tiefen was humorous, liked to talk and laugh, and had the nickname "Old Little Girl", because in Zhu Chen's home, Yiyun was the youngest, and everyone called her Little Girl. Tiefen liked to be close to Yiyun, so his family called him Old Little Girl. Usually, in addition to studying qin art, he was good at photography, and his skills were extremely sophisticated, not losing to famous artists.

### Adding Flowers to Brocade

— Xiao Man

A rickshaw was speeding down the road, carrying an amah with a large pile of gifts. Although the northwest wind was blowing fiercely, the rickshaw puller was sweating profusely. The rickshaw passed through many lines of people buying rice and pulled up to a mansion with tightly closed iron gates. The amah paid the fare, carried the basket and entered.

Before long, the amah came bursting out with an empty basket; closely followed by the mansion's chauffeur, who was carrying several tins of biscuits, and another person who was carrying two hams. They grabbed the gift-giving amah and shoved the hams and biscuits straight into the empty basket; then the madam also came out, panting, "Take these back for the little sisters and little brothers to eat." The gift-giving amah cried out: "Madam, please take them, my madam said, I am not allowed to take anything back, I will be scolded if I do," The madam replied: "It doesn't matter, you say I said it, we have so many hams and biscuits sent to us that we could eat them for two years and still not finish, quickly take them back, lest your madam sends even more. Tell your madam to come and visit." The madam went back inside, and the chauffeur had to shove the amah onto the rickshaw, who was worried about the hams and biscuits in the basket, knowing that she would be scolded as a glutton when she got back, for not even being able to give a gift properly.

"Second Sister, stop teasing him! In this child's mind, he simply thinks of you as higher than his own father!" She said all the way, and then raised her head and giggled; on her chubby round face, every muscle was wrinkled with laughter. "It's a pity that we only have him, otherwise I would have planned to give him to you as a son!"

Yu Hua and Xiang Qi also laughed together.

But Xiang Qi only smiled and then stopped, because she immediately thought of her beloved daughter – Mei Bao.

"If she and her father were here, the happiness of our family would not be less than theirs!" She thought to herself, and the smile on her face completely disappeared.

"Aunt, do you think I should study engineering or law?" Shao Hua saw Xiang Qi's expression and cleverly came up with another question, intending to divert Xiang Qi's thoughts; because since Xiang Qi came to the South, although she had never told anyone her troubles from childhood, Shao Hua observed from her usual demeanor that this aunt of his must have a great hidden pain deeply buried in her heart.

"That's something you should ask your father about," Xiang Qi replied with a forced smile.

"Don't ask me!" Yu Hua put down the bowl in his hand and said, "I don't know anything about things in school. Second Sister, you decide for him! Even if he can't be your son, at least he's already like a godson!"

There was another burst of laughter at the table. (298)

### "Ah! I am to you as they were to me!"

— Liao Mu

In the five or six days of the New Year, everyone's personal life has different feelings, but reflecting on the past and looking forward to the future, we believe that all progressive people have the joy of "tidying up" and "renewing," no matter how bleak the environment is. -- We are still young, and we will inevitably have an advantage in the time path. One more year adds one more level of experience. Life is bitter, but only circling in decadence is a philosophy of escaping reality. Even if some people show a state of "old age" due to physiological reasons, their inner psychology still needs to be transformed by subjective forces, to move forward, and to be young. "An old steed in the stable still aspires to gallop a thousand miles," the ancients have a clear teaching, then we young people dare not be greedy and lazy, and be overcome by time.

In such an environment, I often see many promising young people still lingering in the pink lights, indulging in licentious singing, especially during Christmas and New Year's, and they are more likely to discover their dissolute forms. Zhuangzi said: "A carp trapped in a rut, wetting each other with saliva, warming each other with moisture, is not as good as forgetting each other in the rivers and lakes." Although some are just excuses for bitterness, is this expression beneficial to life? I feel very regretful!

Perhaps it is thought to be old-fashioned talk, but old-fashioned people see what is not new, and constant talkers see what is not talked about. Time, I think, will not be careless with anyone. Don't you see such a more realistic "performance" at this time: "On New Year's Eve, 113 corpses were frozen to death on the streets of the two concessions; on New Year's Day, 38 adults and 34 children died on the streets of the Public Concession; on the same night, 58 were counted in the French Concession." But I still see otter-skinned teenagers and fox-throated girls, pairs of them floating leisurely, wandering on the roads in front of the official residence, looking like immortals. I not only pity the former, but also envy the latter. The distance between the real encounters of life is almost the same! When Wang Yangming wrote about Longchang, he saw a traveler die at the foot of the slope. Thinking that the bones were exposed and ownerless, he went with others to bury them and said with emotion to the helpers: "Ah! I am to you as they were to me!" This is the work of mankind, for others, and for oneself. Wang Yangming gained experience in thousands of hardships, personally practiced them, and added the invention of attaining good knowledge, which shone in the process of life. This is worthy of painful study by the current general decadent youth.

### Do You Wear Gloves?

— Wu Han

Wearing gloves is not limited to winter, just like taking a rickshaw does not necessarily require official business. However, the arrival of gloves, in terms of quantity, is always a sign of cold weather. The most "hard-working" part of the human body is not the hands, but our face. In the chilling morning, the more "old" face, despite the wind and frost, can still resist strongly, but the two so-called omnipotent hands can't stand the first step of stabbing pain, the second step of shaking, and the third step of stiffness. The only way to remedy this is gloves.

The relationship between hands and gloves is the closest, and in English, this phrase describes a close friendship like fish in water. However, more careless people often unintentionally lose a glove. Losing a glove is sometimes like losing a confidant, and it is difficult to find a match anywhere in the world. Moreover, the wonderful thing about old gloves is like warm and unrestrained friends, and old hats that fit the head are generally such that people would rather take the old ones than change to new ones.

Gloves are not necessarily completely useful, just like the vase in the writing room. Look at the white gloves on the hands of the bride, and the silk gloves on the hands of the gentlemen in tailcoats. Not only are they not warm, but they add a layer of separation, but how often have you seen a bride holding white lilies with bare hands, or the three friends of top hat, cane, and gloves being separated?

The rubber gloves on the doctor's hands make people shudder. Apart from the gloves of the obstetrician, and the earliest contact with the newborn baby, the doctor's gloves will never make people feel good! The gloves worn by airline pilots are the thickest and warmest. The leather and fur used on two gloves can at least make a vest. The price of a pair of gloves can buy an acre of land. Although gloves are a small thing, their greatness is like this.

Some young people in Shanghai who like to play, buy a pair of thick fur gloves before they buy a car, wear a short leather coat on their upper body, and look very imposing in front of people, but they are empty shells, and they don't even know what a "clutch" is.

Shaking hands with gloves on, although it is said to be in a hurry, it is always inevitable that there is a lack of sincerity. The best way is to put your right hand in your pocket, and hold a glove in your left hand with gloves on. This is both spectacular and can cope with all kinds of "emergencies", which is the best of both worlds.
