### Reinforcements Arrive Daily, Encirclement Tightens: Bandung to Become Decisive Battlefield; Japanese Forces in Eastern Java Approach Surabaya; Dutch East Indies Forces Launch Fierce Counteroffensive

Tokyo, 7th (Domei News Agency): A dispatch from a "Asahi Shimbun" war correspondent in Java states that Japanese tank units arrived on the plains around Bandung at 3 PM on the 5th of this month. Japanese forces in eastern Java also arrived north of Surabaya on the 4th of this month.

Saigon, 7th (Haitong Telegram): A message from Allied sources last night stated that Japanese forces have begun a general offensive on Bandung. Bandung is the fourth largest city in Java, with a population of 170,000. It is also the location of the Allied headquarters. After the fall of Batavia, the Dutch East Indies government moved its capital here. The dispatch also states that after occupying Batavia, Japanese forces have captured a stretch of plains along the northern coast of Java, 1,000 kilometers long and 50-70 kilometers wide. The Allies can no longer use the northern railway. The only remaining line is along the southern coast from Bandung to Surabaya.

Bandung, 6th (Havas News Agency): The Dutch East Indies General Headquarters recently released a war report stating, "Our forces have withdrawn from Batavia. The situation is serious, but not hopeless. Several key points along the western coast of Java, especially Tjoeroeg, have fallen into Japanese hands. Also, due to the large number of Japanese troops and their complete control of the air, our forces have been subjected to intense bombing by Japanese aircraft. For days, our forces have not been able to rest. The sound of artillery fire from the front lines is loud and clear." Furthermore, an official statement said, "A large part of western Java has now been occupied by Japanese forces. Dutch troops in the area have been withdrawn elsewhere."

Tokyo, 7th (Domei News Agency): Yesterday morning, Japanese forces in Java pressed towards Bandung, the temporary capital of the Dutch East Indies, from the north, reaching a certain location near Oeglong. Japanese forces are also approaching from the west of that location and are currently preparing for a final assault. According to dispatches from the Japanese front lines, Japanese forces that landed on the west coast of Java are attacking south from Batavia, completing the encirclement of Bandung with units from the central coast. Bandung is now within several kilometers of the Japanese encirclement line. Japanese forces that landed on the central coast quickly occupied the Kalidjati airfield and, with the help of tanks, advanced southwest, crossing the mountains on March 4th and reaching a point only five kilometers from Bandung. At the same time, Japanese forces that landed on the east coast of Java bypassed and captured key points west of the naval base of Surabaya, and are now encircling Surabaya.

Bandung, 7th (Reuters): News of the fall of Batavia, the capital of the Dutch East Indies, was announced here last night by the authorities. While the seriousness of the Japanese advance in Java is undeniable, it is believed here that the main battle for Java has not yet begun. The outcome of this battle will be decided in the area around Bandung. Dutch forces in eastern Java are launching fierce counterattacks in small units, hoping to delay the Japanese advance. The situation is changing rapidly and can be described as a state of confusion. The situation in the Sawangan area in the center remains largely unchanged. Japanese forces are still using infiltration tactics. Japanese air forces are constantly active, severely impacting Allied operations. Since Thursday, Bandung has been under long-term air raid alerts. According to impressions obtained by a Reuters correspondent yesterday, the battle for Java is about to reach its climax. Japanese reinforcements are landing continuously, and they have already gained an overwhelming advantage in terms of manpower and equipment. The air is practically a Japanese domain. The Dutch counteroffensive, originally intended as a preemptive strike to eliminate the Japanese offensive, has failed. In terms of troop strength on Java, positional warfare is no longer possible. The only hope for survival lies in a risky counterattack, but it has already been severely impacted and is difficult to reorganize. The Japanese are aware of this and are attacking with all their strength. Japanese forces have driven deep into a large plain on the northeastern coast of Java, 600 miles long and about 35 miles deep. They are now fiercely attacking the defenses around Bandung. Bandung, originally the location of the Allied headquarters and the Dutch East Indies government after its relocation from Batavia, has overnight become one of the front-line cities. Although the situation is chaotic, the Japanese are undoubtedly encircling Bandung. Air raid alerts in Bandung have been constant for the past two days. The authorities announced yesterday that there would be a long-term alert and that alerts would only be issued when large numbers of Japanese aircraft are actually approaching, to avoid unnecessary disturbances. On Thursday night, a 100% blackout was implemented here for the first time. In hotels, food was placed on long tables, and people helped themselves. The air was filled with the smell of burnt paper, as government agencies and businesses burned documents. According to disclosures from the authorities here, whether Java can be defended for long depends entirely on reinforcements. Reinforcements were originally scheduled to arrive in the second half of February, but they have not arrived, and the situation will become even more isolated.

Lack of Airpower Affecting the Battle

Melbourne, 6th (Associated Press): The performance of the American naval and air forces has delayed the Japanese advance on Java by as much as a week. It was not until last week, when American bomber squadrons withdrew from Java due to the lack of escort fighters, that the Japanese began actively preparing to quickly complete the conquest of Dutch territory in order to concentrate their forces on invading Australia. Many American bombers were shot down in the field last week because the reinforcements of escort squadrons failed to reach their destination as scheduled. Java's difficult situation is the same as Malaya's. When the reporter left Java for Australia, there were still some Royal Air Force and American pilots on the island. However, they had no aircraft to fight with, and they had nothing to follow up due to the lack of reinforcements. They lacked not only fighter protection, but also proper anti-aircraft protection.

Shift in Battle Situation Shocks London

Stockholm, 7th (Haitong Telegram): According to Swedish sources, although the British people had anticipated the unfavorable situation in the Java war in the middle of last week, the rapid fall of Batavia was a shock to London. The speed of Batavia's fall was unexpected, and it is believed that other war centers in Java will also be occupied. London military experts believe that after the Japanese fully occupy the Dutch East Indies, they will turn their attention to Australia and India. The future movements of the Japanese are the focus of discussion in British newspapers. For example, the "Daily Telegraph" pointed out that the recent British reinforcement of Ceylon suggests that the Japanese will invade Ceylon after occupying the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. The newspaper further pointed out the military importance of Colombo and Trincomalee, and believed that Darwin and the Samoan Islands might be attacked to threaten North American shipping lanes.

### General Wavell Concurrently Appointed Administrative Member of the Indian Viceroy's Office; Lucknow Militia Mobilized

London, 7th (Reuters): The authorities here announced yesterday that General Wavell, Commander-in-Chief of India, has been appointed concurrently as a member of the Administrative Council of the Indian Viceroy's Office, succeeding General Harlet.

Saigon, 7th (Haitong Telegram): According to a report from New Delhi yesterday, in view of the tense situation in the East Indies, the British military authorities have now ordered the mobilization of the Lucknow militia, and the United Provinces have declared a state of emergency. Punjab has also spent 8 million rupees to build air-raid shelters.

### Indian People Eager for Autonomy

London, 6th (Special Telegram): A dispatch from the "Times" in New Delhi states that the recent announcement by the British government that there will soon be a new decision on India has made Indian people eager for a more concrete solution to the Indian problem. All factions in India are united in their firm stance against the Axis powers, but believe that this resistance is linked to their own struggle for liberation. The National Congress no longer advocates forming a national government based solely on one faction. The general opinion is to establish a temporary government during the war, integrating Buddhist and Muslim factions. According to this method, the relative strength of the representatives of each faction in the government does not need to be determined by the British government. The non-British government should indicate what kind of governing power it is willing to relinquish. If the British government can be sincere, the Indian side will not be extremely opposed. The position of Minister of Defense in the government should still be held by a British person, but other ministries should be given to Indians. According to observations from various quarters, if such a temporary government can be established and truly represent all factions, even if the existing constitution is not amended, the Indian people can obtain real power internally and externally. On the one hand, the power of the British government's India and Burma Office to supervise India will gradually decrease. At the same time, this temporary government will represent India in the British Empire and internationally, and participate in various conferences of the Allied countries on war and peace. In this way, the temporary government can be a direct path to de facto dominion status.

Sydney, 6th (Havas News Agency): Australian Federal Prime Minister Curtin recently told reporters that the commander of the Australian troops in Malaya, General Bennett, has safely returned to Australia from Singapore. He was quite tired during the journey. After resting for a few days, he will take up a new position.

Sydney, 6th (Reuters): Former commander of the Australian troops in Malaya, Bennett, wrote an article in the Sydney Morning Herald, describing the Malayan campaign. He said that the Australian troops proved their ability and were actually better than the Japanese until the Japanese finally attacked Singapore with overwhelming force. The Australian troops never gave up an inch of ground unless other positions wavered or they were surrounded by the enemy and had to break out. A portion of the troops sent from Britain did not fight in Malaya. At the same time, the Indian troops, who had been fighting hard for a long time, were exhausted and unable to stop the Japanese flanking attacks. Therefore, the Australian troops were forced to retreat, abandoning each position one by one. After reorganization, a total of seven battalions of Australian troops withdrew from Singapore. The authorities assigned the northwestern part of Singapore to the Australian troops for defense, but that unit had no prepared positions, and with such a small force, it was impossible to defend such a vast area. Japanese aircraft encountered no resistance except for anti-aircraft fire. While the Australian troops were busy building artillery and machine gun positions, Japanese aircraft bombed and strafed our troops. The maps taken by the Japanese were later captured by our side, and every artillery position and machine gun of the Australian troops was clearly marked. The Japanese then opened fire and destroyed all our searchlights. Japanese aircraft launched a full-scale attack in the dark, covering the landing troops. The troops on both flanks of the Australian troops retreated again, defending another new position, and did not retreat until the surrender was announced.

### U.S. State Department Announces Sending Delegation to India to Help Develop Resources and Facilitate Operations; Indian Government Agrees

Washington, 6th: The State Department formally announced today the dispatch of an industrial delegation to India. The full text is as follows: "Accelerating the development of India's resources to serve as a supply base for Allied military needs in the Far East and Near East has become increasingly necessary due to the development of the military situation in the Pacific. The United States government has specifically consulted the Indian government on whether it agrees to the United States sending an industrial delegation to India to examine the efforts the United States can make to develop India's resources. The Indian government has now expressed its agreement. The United States has decided to promote the realization of this as soon as possible, and the members of the delegation will be announced in the near future. Both the United States and India sincerely hope that this step in US-India cooperation will contribute to the victory of the Allied countries." The "Chicago Sun-Times" reported yesterday that former U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Grady will be the head of the delegation. Other members include expert Herrington and automotive engineer Best.

Washington, 6th (Reuters): The War Department announced that the U.S. delegation will go to India as soon as possible. The military situation in Southeast Asia makes it necessary to develop India's resources, and at the same time makes it necessary for the United States to use India as its military base for the Near East and Far East. The Indian government has agreed to this matter. The US and Indian governments hope that this move will further strengthen US-India ties.

Stockholm, 7th (Haitong Telegram): British Minister of Production Lyttelton told reporters yesterday about the situation in North Africa. He said that Britain's chances of defending Egypt are now better than when the Libyan campaign began. The British army has gained a lot of experience in desert warfare. The British war in the Near East depends on whether they can guarantee the lifeline of the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf from enemy attacks. Therefore, it is the only route for the US and Britain to transport military supplies to the British army in the Near East. The Iranian railway has been improved, so more supplies are being transported to the Soviet army. Regarding his new position, Lyttelton said that he could not express anything at this time.

### US Treasury Secretary Proposes Tax Plan

Washington, 6th: US Treasury Secretary Morgenthau submitted a detailed tax plan to Congress yesterday. Under the plan, the United States would increase new taxes by nearly $100 billion in the next fiscal year. Morgenthau told Congress, "This new tax is quite large and will affect every family in the United States, but there is no cheap war today. No matter how large the war expenditure, the victor is always a million times cheaper than the vanquished. In terms of the amount of this new tax, it exceeds the total tax revenue of the United States in any year before 1941." The plan proposes to double most individual income taxes. Some income taxes are paid directly by the employer. Other corporate taxes, inheritance taxes, and fifteen existing taxes will be increased. Social insurance taxes will also be greatly increased. The intention is not only to help raise war funds, but also to absorb a large amount of idle funds at a time when the supply of daily necessities is gradually shrinking, which can also curb inflation. The "New York Times" wrote yesterday that the United States had long anticipated such a large tax increase, and we must be prepared to accept it.

### South Africa Increases Taxes

Stockholm, 7th (Haitong Telegram): The South African government's taxes for the coming year have increased in all aspects. As far as gold mine taxes are concerned, there will be no change, but their special tax will increase from 16% to 20% of net profit. The special business tax can bring in 4 million pounds more per year than in previous years, and the gold tax can increase by 1.46 million pounds. Last year's gold production created a new record, worth 120 million pounds. The production in the previous two years was only 45.5 million pounds. Last year's total treasury revenue was 79.5 million pounds, and this year it can reach 88 million pounds. Last year's military expenditure totaled 72 million pounds, half of which came from taxes. This year's national defense expenditure totals 80 million pounds. Last year's imports reached 100 million pounds, compared to 96 million pounds the year before. Last year's gold and wool exports were 31 million pounds and 28 million pounds respectively. South Africa's imports from the United States ranked first, reaching 38 million pounds, while imports from the UK were only 30 million pounds.

### British Government Promulgates New National Defense Regulations; Home Guard Implements Motorization

London, 6th (Reuters): The Ministry of Labor and the Ministry of National Service announced that if the British mainland is invaded by the enemy, the government will mobilize the strength of the people. The government has promulgated new national defense regulations, authorizing the chief administrative officers of each district to declare their jurisdiction as a combat zone after consulting with the military authorities, so as to conscript any people to serve, or force them to join the army, navy, air force and various government departments. The remuneration obtained by those who should serve should not be lower than the ordinary remuneration. The promulgation of the above regulations is only of a precautionary nature, and will only be implemented when the enemy invades or the situation is extremely urgent. However, it does not apply to personnel of the military police and various combat agencies. Those who violate the regulations may be sentenced to imprisonment for up to ten years, or fined up to 500 pounds, or both imprisonment and fine. The commander of the combat area has the right to arrest those who violate the regulations or are suspected of violating them, without prior investigation.

Stockholm, 7th (Haitong Telegram): According to news from London, most of the British Home Guard has been motorized. The British public and the press warmly welcomed it.

### The Lisu People on Nu Mountain (Part Two)

Such a big feast usually has dancing and singing to help the fun. Without song and dance, the wine and meat would be greatly diminished. After breakfast, around nine or ten o'clock, preparations begin, boiling meat, carrying wine to a mountain clearing. The sun shines on every excited face, and the girls are even more dressed in new clothes and ornaments. The chief or village chief's senior wife is in charge of cooking and also serves as the wine server. Naturally, there are several other women helping. Around one or two o'clock in the afternoon, the wine begins to be passed around. Gradually, there is singing, laughter, and cheers. Naturally, those who can't stand it stand in a circle, men and women, holding hands, and their feet move. So the dance begins, turning from left to right, hand in hand, in a circle. Sometimes the famous lusheng (reed pipe wind instrument) is used to help the dance, and the beat is made by stomping the feet on the ground, up and down, following the rise and fall of the lusheng. The wine is not abandoned during the dance. The wine is passed from outside the circle to the mouths of the dancers, sip by sip. Those who don't drink are singing. Around dusk, the meat is cooked or roasted, and people take turns leaving the dance circle to eat. Three or five people sit in a pile, still using wine to wash down the meat. After eating, they go back to dancing. Unconsciously, when they can't see each other's faces in the dark, several bonfires are lit. The dance circle then centers around the fire, and dances around it. The firelight is warm, illuminating the red, smoky faces and the rising and falling bodies.

However, is this feast limited to eating, drinking, singing, and dancing? No. The native girls have large, round eyes, smiling faces, and sing enchanting tunes. The Lisu young men are not stones, how can they not be moved? The Lisu young men begin to feel that they should "counterattack." So they wink, throw out endearing sentences, and laugh heartily, unable to contain their joy. The firelight illuminates a mouthful of white teeth and a pair of inquisitive eyes. They continue to dance, sing, and joke, forgetting everything. Suddenly, this couple disappears from the dance circle. They quietly slip out of the crowd. At this time, the four mountains are silent, the sky is full of stars, and they are submerged in the darkness. The singing, foot-stomping, laughter, and cheers continue in the circle of light. The old people begin to doze off, and the children are in their mothers' arms, sleeping by the fire. But the young people continue to dance wildly until the sun climbs over the mountains, the dew on the grass gradually dries, and people scatter home.

After this feast, people will always receive several "Come, please eat wedding wine" notices. The person who first shot the wild animal gets the head, eats the meat, washes it clean, and hangs the skull in the house as a "record of achievement." In the house of a good hunter, we can see dozens of animal heads, displayed in rows.

Five

The most prideful thing about the deep mountains is the inexhaustible supply of wood. This can be seen from the building materials of the Lisu people's houses. The house is made of thick tree trunks stacked horizontally from the ground up. All four walls are like this. Only one or two small holes are dug as windows. The roof is arched, looking like the shape of the Chinese character "人" (ren, person) from both ends, also made of wood trunks. This kind of house is commonly called "wood coffin room." It is quite long and large. One house can accommodate three or four families, each family using a fire pit as a standard, one fire pit per family. But in the lower reaches of the Lancang River and the Nu River, bamboo strips and wood trunks are used together, probably because the wood in that area is not as abundant as in the upper reaches.

Living in the high mountains, even in summer, it is still very cold at night. Therefore, the Lisu's fire pit is burning all year round. Their activities are in the spring, summer, and autumn. In winter, when the mountains are covered with snow, they do not leave their homes unless it is absolutely necessary. A winter's worth of food and supplies must be prepared before winter. On winter nights, when the mountains are full of snow and the wind howls, it is the time for the old people to sit by the fire and tell stories and myths to the children. In this way, the wisdom of the Lisu is passed down from generation to generation. They have many stories and songs, and they are very interesting, which will be described later. (End)

### Dr. W. T. Wei Tan's New Method for Treating Nervous System Disorders and Sexual Impotence

Dr. Wei Tan's new nasal membrane contact therapy is the latest treatment for all ailments caused by nervous system weakness and disorders.

The sympathetic nervous system in the human body regulates the function of the brain. If the function of the sympathetic nerve is impaired, all kinds of diseases will arise. Dr. Wei Tan uses several small metal extractors to contact the large nerve branches in the nasal membrane to stimulate the entire nervous system and achieve excellent results.

This new therapy is extremely effective in treating stubborn diseases that were previously considered incurable. Asthma is often caused by nervous system disorders, and this method can cure it radically. Asthma disappears after a few applications of this method. Headaches are a very common ailment, and this new method is extremely effective in treating them.

When children suffer from nervous system disorders, they often lose consciousness and experience convulsions throughout their bodies. Dr. Wei Tan's new therapy can cure them in just a few days. Dr. Wei Tan has cured many patients who suffer from vaguely defined pain caused by nervous system disorders. These are generally symptoms such as a heavy stomach after meals, difficulty sleeping, depression, anxiety, irritability, moodiness, and a sense of disorientation all day long. All these symptoms of neurasthenia are caused by an imbalance in the sympathetic nervous system, and Dr. Wei Tan's new method can cure them in just a few days.

As for those who suffer from insomnia, Dr. Wei Tan's new method can restore them to normal sleep and prevent them from being disturbed by nightmares. In addition to the above-mentioned symptoms, there is one that is most noteworthy among patients with neurasthenia, namely, sexual impotence. Dr. Wei Tan's treatment is remarkably effective.

In fact, all cases of sexual impotence, reduced reproductive function, or premature ejaculation are caused by disorders of the sympathetic nervous system. Patients are often hypersensitive and have a heightened sense of feeling, and some tend to develop neurasthenia. During intercourse, they are often anxious and fear that it will suddenly stop, but this fear can immediately affect their sexual performance.

Even worse, disorders of the sympathetic nervous system can lead to atrophy of the reproductive glands, resulting in impotence and yin deficiency. Regardless of the severity of the condition, after a few applications of the new nasal membrane contact method, patients who were previously unable to have intercourse can immediately restore their original state, just like normal people. At the same time, women suffering from sexual dysfunction can also be cured. Women who suffer from this condition are fearful of sexual intercourse, so what pleasure can they derive from it?

The seriousness of this condition is often overlooked. In fact, how many happy marriages and sweet families have been destroyed by this condition, leading to discord and disharmony between husband and wife, which is truly lamentable!

Fortunately, thanks to Dr. Wei Tan's miraculous skill, women can be cured and rejuvenated through nasal membrane contact, and from then on enjoy a happy and fulfilling family life.

From this perspective, those who previously considered their ailments incurable and gave up hope of recovery because there was no other treatment available can now regain their health and optimism thanks to Dr. Wei Tan's miraculous nasal membrane contact technique. How fortunate they are!

Dr. Wei Tan's medical office is now located on the second floor of 868 Jing'an Temple Road (near Route Metteth Hust). Clinic hours are from 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM and from 3:00 PM to 6:00 PM daily. Closed on Saturday afternoons and Sundays. Telephone: 36195. A Chinese translator is available to assist patients. For appointments at Dr. Wei Tan's residence, please call 70902. (Residence address: 602 Route Fuli Li).

### Gambler Impoverished, Gangs Up for Robbery

Kong Jisheng, a carpenter from Ningbo, often went to a gambling den in western Shanghai to gamble, hoping to get lucky. However, he lost every time, and the hundreds of dollars he had saved from his wages and clothes were all pawned. Starving and cold, he could not make a living, so he colluded with several other gambling friends who were on the run, and used fake pistols to rob pedestrians of their property on Wusong Road and Peng Road to make a living. At 2:00 PM the day before yesterday, he robbed a Western woman, Jiu Zezi, of a wallet on Wusong Road, containing valuables worth 120 yuan. He was arrested by Chinese Constable No. 749 of the Hongkou Police Department and prosecuted for gang robbery under the criminal law. As a result, Kong Jisheng was sentenced to four months in prison to serve as a warning.

### French Radio Station's Fundraising Broadcast Receives Enthusiastic Response

The French radio station in this city has been raising funds for the Nanton Children's Relief Home run by the Salvation Army on Singapore Road. Listeners from all walks of life in the Chinese community have generously donated. Within a week, a total of 18,000 yuan has been raised. French listeners, in order to express their spirit of mutual assistance, have also generously donated, and the amount is not included. Mrs. Li Weiai, the director of the radio station, is extremely grateful for the enthusiastic support of listeners from all walks of life. What is particularly gratifying is that listeners from all walks of life, regardless of age, have all volunteered to help. For example, most children have used their New Year's money as donations. In total, the radio station has received no less than 200 red envelopes. Moreover, three brothers braved the rain to donate 5 yuan of their saved candy money. An apprentice from a factory in Pu-Jian also donated his year-end bonus of 10 yuan. A Chinese officer from the French police department had his eight-year-old daughter sing at the radio station to help raise funds, and a certain pharmacy volunteered to send advertisements. The director of the radio station is deeply grateful for the enthusiastic support of all sectors of society.

### A Group of Early Birds in the Park (3)

— Ye Jingfeng

There is also an old Cantonese, who is also a backbone member of this group. I often see him massaging his face towards the sun at the first sign of dawn, like a cat washing its face. This is a little "secret immortal technique" type of small action. I often see many people in other areas doing the same, but not as diligently as the old Cantonese. Perhaps he is eager to erase all the wrinkles that have been weathered by the wind and rain for sixty years? This old bird's Tai Chi Quan is quite qualified. His movements are slow and gentle, and it seems that every movement is focused and concentrates all his spirit, feeling the flow of Qi and blood throughout his body. This is the only secret to Tai Chi Quan "practicing". At the same time, he is an old but vigorous Huang Zhong: once I saw him climbing onto a tree branch to perform "three hangings". A member of the group shouted at him, "Hey, old man, are you looking for death? You are so old!..."

Recently, another small mustache has joined this group, with a bit of bureaucratic air, perhaps a politician bird who has stepped down (?). I don't seem to have seen this kind of character appear in the park before, but recently he often appears, practicing Tai Chi, playing push hands. His Kung Fu seems to be a little worse than that director bird, but the level is not bad. Looking at his actions, maybe he is the leader of this group.

There is also a bald Ningbo bird, also around sixty years old, who is often late, which leads me to think that he may be a member of the bourgeoisie. This is a bit strange: because the only sports for our country's business community are mahjong, smoking opium pipes, embracing dancing girls, and playing with prostitutes. But this Ningbo bird, if he is really from the bourgeoisie, can prove that he understands the greater righteousness, knows to abandon all evil deeds in times of national crisis, and exercises his body and mind. It is indeed worthy of praise!

Or someone might say, how narrow is your perspective? There are quite a few members of the Shanghai bourgeoisie who practice Tai Chi Quan, etc. You just haven't seen them.

True. But in my humble opinion, they may not be focused on fitness, but because "chopping every day" is too exhausting and replenishing acupuncture is not effective, so they want to seek help from Tai Chi to strengthen their essence and replenish their kidneys. As the saying goes, "Heaven's heart is supremely fair!" This class of rich and idle people has enjoyed all kinds of comfort, and God will never allow them to invade nature and enjoy this kind of pure happiness. Why do I say that? Because if they knew that sunshine and fresh air are the supreme treasures for cultivating body and mind, they would definitely use their minds to exploit human happiness, and hoard the sun and air in a monopolistic way. Wouldn't that make the common people even more miserable? If you say it's impossible to hoard? Well, the attics, kitchens, pavilion buildings, etc., are sacrificed and have to apportion more than thirty yuan in rent every month, and they end up never seeing the light of day all year round. Isn't this a precedent for hoarding insects to show their skills? Let's stop the digression and continue talking about birds.

To the south of the Tai Chi Bird Group area is the largest flower garden in the Beiqiao area. This flower garden has all kinds of rockeries and flower stands; small bridges and broken streams, with paths crisscrossing; and a set of Convex Emerald and Concave Emerald Villa in the Red Mansions Yi Hong Garden. There is also a small waterfall hidden in it, but unfortunately it doesn't have much water. On a stone mountain peak not far from the waterfall, amidst the maple leaves, a lonely bird is often seen facing the morning sun, practicing breathing exercises. Seeing him, I couldn't help but think of the story of fox spirits absorbing the essence of the sun and moon. Every time this lonely bird finishes a session of breathing exercises, it must follow it with a shout. Genuine dantian qi, coupled with a loud and sonorous voice, this shout is no small matter. If the people walking in the morning are too timid, they might lose their three souls and seven spirits after this shout.

The words "breathing" are originally terms of the immortals; simply put, it is just deep breathing to exhale the old and inhale the new. If done properly, it is indeed a very wonderful fitness technique. What is terrible is that many people have misunderstood the method, so they cannot see the effect and instead suffer from it!

In this flower garden area, there are also a few solitary birds, some hiding behind the flower bushes playing Baduanjin, some practicing massage, which in Taoist terms is called "guiding"; others are reviewing the flexible gymnastics they practiced at school before. In short, I won't go into too much detail.

In addition to the large and small groups in the Beiqiao area, there are also several small groups in the Nanqiao area. In the cypress forest west of the mica stone music stage, there are often a few young people working hard there. In addition to playing with large dumbbells, they also practice several kinds of free-style muscle exercises, most of which are intense. According to the investigation, they are all employees of a barber shop. Because of their profession, they can only exercise earlier than ordinary early birds. I don't know whether their goal is to gain more strength for themselves, or because the country is in trouble, and they are preparing themselves for the future?

Facing south, crossing the avenue, in the northwest corner of the large lawn, under the pine forest, there is a semi-group of birds. It is called a semi-group because most of the time there is only a lonely goose active, and sometimes a couple (?) of birds come to participate. This lonely goose comes every day except in storms and severe winter. His main exercise is Western-style fitness. Looking at his movements, you know that he has received considerable training, and his physique matches this kind of exercise. He has a short and stocky body, quite fierce and strong, and if he is sent to the front line, he will definitely make contributions. But that couple of birds is a bit inexplicable: needless to say the wife bird, but the old bird is indeed an unmistakable lazy bird. Sometimes he does something, but he is lazy all over: stretching out his arms, like yawning, squatting down, like a Shandong person squatting in a pit, and doesn't want to get up for a long time. For a period of time, he was even seen learning Tai Chi.

From here, you can see a Simending walkway surrounding the large lawn. A whole circle is about a thousand yards long, which is about one and a half li in Chinese miles. This walkway is also the main place for early birds to exercise.

Every morning at around 7:00, there is always a big bird practicing running on this walkway. Sometimes he runs two or three laps, sometimes four or five laps. His endurance is not bad, but unfortunately he has no posture. Jogging is also a good fitness exercise, but first the posture must be reasonable, and second it must be limited, otherwise I am afraid that the harm outweighs the benefits.

Often with this big bird is a short rail chicken. They seem to be brothers, but one is tall and the other is short, which complements each other interestingly. This rail chicken's exercise can be called the middle way: neither long-distance running nor walking, but flapping his wings and striding forward. This method is really steady. The principle of exercise is to get it right and stop at the right time.

In addition, on this walkway, almost regardless of wind or rain, you can see an old bird with a mustache on his mouth and a figure-eight step under his feet, doing a walking exercise. He probably walks ten or eight laps every day. Although the style of walking is not beautiful, the two arms are dragged behind him, and they sway back and forth mechanically, which is very rhythmic. In addition to the walking exercise, the author once discovered a secret exercise of his. It turns out that before walking, he hides outside the short bushes where no one goes, and there he puts his hands on his hips and twists his buttocks greatly, constantly twisting, like a clown on stage doing that pose to a female role. It is said that this action is extremely beneficial to the waist and kidneys.

On the large lawn, there is also a Tianjin bird that cannot be buried. He is in his thirties, tall and upright, with a well-proportioned physique. The area around the thatched hut on the large lawn is his sliding ground. His main exercise is like Baduanjin and Western-style gymnastics, neither intense nor lukewarm, but moderate. Sometimes he also runs slowly for a lap or two on the walkway. When he runs, he always puts up his back wings and flaps them, which is a bit like a rooster spreading its wings and preparing to fight.

Next to this thatched hut, there is also a mysterious bird. Every day when the sun is high, he hides in the bushes at the right side of the entrance of the thatched hut, facing the direction of the sunrise on the large lawn, practicing movements in the style of the Yijin Jing. His kung fu has reached a considerable level, and although his body is very thin, his spirit is good. I don't know if he is shy, or afraid of leaking secrets, he is always so hiding. Why is this mysterious bird a mysterious bird?

To the west of the big fish pond, crossing the avenue, walking across the grass slope, there is a soil hill facing each other. This hill is in the shape of a French bread, high in the middle and pointed at both ends. On this high stone road, you can sometimes see a gentleman bird in his thirties meditating. There is a long chair there, and he sits on the edge of the chair, sitting upright facing east, closing his eyes and concentrating. Here he didn't put on a meditating posture, of course, because the chair seat is not very suitable; but you can see that he has been practicing meditation for many years. Next to him, a wife, presumably his wife, is actually there waving her arms and practicing Western-style deep breathing. This couple's fitness technique has the wonderful combination of Chinese and Western styles, and they can not interfere with each other and do their own thing. It is indeed rare.

Following the mountain road south, passing around the temple-style canteen, you can reach the largest flower stand in the southern area. This flower stand is surrounded by five-foot-high German holly trees. In the center of the platform is a stone-carved foreign "Four Unlike", installed on a three-layer stone platform. This platform is surrounded by a circle of square brick paved walkways. These square brick roads extend in all directions. Various geometric flower beds are arranged here, and beautiful flowers bloom in all seasons. There is a piece of grass sunken in the north, with a semicircular elegant seat, the ground is paved with flower tiles, and it seems to be inlaid with a double dragon playing with pearls pattern. There is also an early bird here, seeking the source of health. His main exercise is to first practice Tai Chi Quan, and then do Western-style calisthenics. It can be said that he has learned both Chinese and Western styles. But I don't understand why he wants to advance in both Chinese and Western styles; is it to achieve the skill of "Chinese learning as the foundation and Western learning as the application"?

On the circular road next to this foreign "Four Unlike", there is sometimes another solitary bird, practicing another school of Tai Chi Quan. Looking at it, it seems to be the Northern school; it is more complex and lengthy than the Southern school. After finishing Tai Chi, he must face the sun, close his eyes and stand still, while massaging his lower abdomen with both hands, I don't know if he is practicing dantian qi. This character's physique is quite healthy. Sometimes you can see him jogging or walking fast on the main walkway, and there are traces of him in the North District Garden and in front of the ancient corridor in the west. He appears and disappears unpredictably. This is a strange bird.

In addition to the above, there are two sports birds and a full-time flyer that must be mentioned. One of the two, his running posture can be said to be beautiful and flawless. His training method is extremely special, he is a racing expert, and his training place is in the special area of the concert. The other sports bird practices on the main walkway, running quite skillfully. Speaking of the full-time flyer, he is an unadulterated Western bird, over fifty years old, wearing a white flannel shirt, white shorts, white socks, and white running shoes, and his face is so red that it seems to be about to bleed. His set of exercises is fast walking, jogging, and some light stretching. Both the north and south areas of the park have his footprints: but since December 8th last year, his bird shadow has never been seen in the vast park!

There are no less than hundreds of early birds in the park. What is recorded in this article is only a few, and it is inevitable that there is a feeling of missing one in ten thousand. I hope that everyone in the world, from heroes and good men to coolies, in addition to taking care of their own public and private affairs, will also pay a little attention to their health; because life is only a hundred years, which is just a snap of the fingers, why bother? ——Amitabha!

### Eight Bread Factories in the French Concession Ordered to Close by Deadline Reason: Wasting Flour and Manufacturing Poorly

The Bureau of Public Works of the Concession hereby issues a notice: The French Concession authorities have recently conducted a thorough study of the manufacturing of bread within the Concession. The police department and the health department, based on the notice issued by the French military supply department, studied the manufacturing methods, such as the equipment and hygiene of the bakery, and the nutritional content and digestibility of the bread sold. According to the survey results, only two of the 29 bakeries in this concession produce the best, five produce second best, fourteen produce mediocre bread, and the remaining eight are the worst.

Improve Output

Four Measures Due to restrictions on the amount of flour, poor manufacturing methods, inevitable waste of flour, and poor-quality bread that harms hygiene. Because corn flour must be added to bread in the short term, and if the manufacturing method is not good, the output will be even more unsatisfactory, the following measures are hereby promulgated: Bakeries with poor output and unimproved equipment should be closed from March 12. Customers of these bakeries can purchase from other bakeries (these bakeries can receive more flour). Bakeries that continue to operate must make improvements according to the instructions of the Police Department and the Health Department. The method of bread manufacturing should be printed in various languages and distributed to each bakery. With the permission of the French military authorities, a special department will be established by the military supply department so that bakeries with poor equipment can send people to learn.

To Be Closed

Factory Names

The following bakeries should be closed: No. B4, Lane 439, Route Minteinying “Homelaof Bakery”, No. A4, Lane 439, Route Minteinying Xiang Sheng Bakery, No. 160, Route Belleret Shiyi Bakery, No. 411, Route Foch Oarnation Bakery, No. 473, Route Conty Fukang Bakery, No. 255, Route Alfieri Bolin Bakery, No. 6, Lane 78, Route Lafayette Wei Kuo Bakery, No. 100, Route Glocq Kang Sheng Bakery,

### This Autumn's Cotton Is Expected to Be Abundant

Continuous rainfall exceeds records. According to the record of Xujiahui Observatory, Mupu started to rain on January 24. Although it occasionally cleared up afterwards, rain followed, and the total rainfall reached 144.8 meters until the 6th of this month. The amount of rainfall and the length of the period are rare in history. Since the day before yesterday, the weather has started to clear up, and the climate yesterday suddenly became extremely cold. The lowest temperature dropped to 36.7 degrees Fahrenheit (it was 41 degrees the day before yesterday). Ice was seen in the ditches again, and the frost on the roof tiles was very thick, resulting in many people freezing to death on the road. However, the day before yesterday was the 20th day of the first lunar month. The weather cleared up in the evening after the rain, predicting that the cotton harvest this autumn will be abundant.

### Crew of the President Harrison Ship Have Been Released Allowed to Move Freely in Shanghai Some Remain on Board

The President Harrison, a ship of the American President Lines, was chased by a Japanese ship when the Pacific War broke out and ran aground outside the mouth of Wusong. After being salvaged and floated by the Japanese, the entire crew was still detained on the ship. It is now learned that the crew of the ship have been released by the Japanese authorities and allowed to move freely in Shanghai. However, some crew members remain on board, as they are necessary to maintain the ship.

### Discounting of Interbank Bills of Exchange Will Be Changed to a Handling Fee A Uniform Charge of 3 Jiao per Thousand Yuan

Since the Money Industry Association decided to increase the discounting of interbank bills of exchange, stipulating a discount of 3 jiao per thousand yuan, and changed the name of the discount to a handling fee, which has been implemented since March. In order to unify the handling of silver and money industries, the Silver and Money Industries Association will discuss and handle it in the same way. It is heard that the various banks and firms have never been uniform in discounting. Some calculate based on the amount of the payment, and some charge a handling fee based on the number of checks. Once a consensus is reached, a uniform handling fee of 3 jiao per thousand yuan will be charged.

### After the Price of Woolens Rose The Future of the Tailoring Industry in This City The Cost of Labor and Materials Is High, and It Is Not Easy to Add Spring Clothes

Before the outbreak of the war in this city, tailoring shops were distributed in the Jing'an Temple Road, Nanjing Road, North Sichuan Road, Sichuan Road, Avenue Joffre, and Daxin Street areas. After the war broke out, most of the tailoring shops on North Sichuan Road moved to Avenue Joffre. The general current situation of the industry has now been explored and is described below.

Grade of Location

Those who have worn Western clothes for a long time all know that tailoring shops are divided into grades, and the road where the shop is located is the dividing line. For example, those located on Nanjing Road and Jing'an Temple Road are first-class, Sichuan Road is second, Avenue Joffre is next, and Daxin Street is last. However, this type of division is only in general terms. For example, tailoring shops on Daxin Street are thought to have too large a difference between the marked price and the actual price, and the workmanship and materials are unreliable. But in fact, this is not the case for all of them. According to people in the tailoring industry with experience, there are also several stores on Daxin Street whose products are excellent and whose prices are fair, but this is not understood by ordinary customers. Because it is located on Daxin Street, it is regarded as a fourth-class tailoring shop.

Expensive Raw Materials

Eighty to ninety percent of the raw materials for Western clothes come from Europe and the United States. During the war, overseas transportation was blocked, and the purchase price of these imported woolens increased sharply. In the past, the value of an overcoat was only dozens of yuan, but now an ordinary overcoat, including sewing, costs hundreds of yuan, and expensive ones even exceed two thousand yuan, an increase of more than thirty times. Domestically produced woolens are also widely used in the market, such as those from Zhanghua and Yinfeng factories. Their products are quite good, but due to cost reasons, the price is only second to European and American woolens. In the past, the British-owned Jardine Woolen Mill produced the most, and because it was manufactured in this port, the price was slightly lower. Now, it has stopped production like the domestic woolen mills.

Last Year's Business

In the 30th year of the Republic of China, the tailoring industry was very developed due to the abnormal prosperity of this port. The annual business of Peilo Meng on Jing'an Temple Road reached more than one million yuan, and Huili on Nanjing Road ranked second. In general, the tailoring shops were all very prosperous and made a lot of profits. The situation this year is different, and the future of the tailoring industry cannot be as optimistic as in the past.

Current Labor Costs

As of now, the highest sewing cost is more than 250 yuan per set - Meng and others are all like this. ABC and similar tailoring shops are more than 150 yuan. The stores on Daxin Street, which usually charge the lowest prices, now do not do business for less than 100 yuan. This point is sufficient to prove the high level of living for workers in Shanghai.

Ready-Made Suits

Before the war, some tailoring shops specialized in targeting college students. Now, many are also troubled by the economy and rarely add clothes. Their business has plummeted as a result, and they have had to change their ways. Some specialize in making ready-made suits and overcoats from lower-grade woolens such as board silk and Taks, publish advertisements, and attract customers with low prices. Their business is quite good. The old clothing stores that moved from the Wusong Road area to Avenue Joffre also display many ready-made new suits and overcoats, and the situation is the same. After all, making ready-made clothes from high-quality materials for sale is extremely uneconomical in terms of business principles.

Difficult to Add Clothes The severe winter has passed, and the warm weather of spring and summer will follow. According to people in the industry, very few people are adding spring clothes, because the market is tight, and they don't even have time to buy rice and coal, so where do they get the extra money to add new clothes? However, the price of woolens for summer use has risen sharply. French flannel is about 150 yuan per yard, and valitin and bombazine are almost 100 yuan per yard. This price is still the black market price, because the hoarders are simply unwilling to release them early, and there are no large spot transactions on the market. If the weather turns hot, the price of flannel and other woolens will continue to increase. It is almost impossible to import European and American woolens in the future. However, the inventory in this port is still abundant.

### Widening of Kunming Road and Maohai Road

Area 0.490 acres According to the announcement of the Public Works Department of the工部局, it has been agreed that the following land will be划归the Public Works Department for collection and used for widening or extending roads. The details are as follows: Road name: Kunming Road and Maohai Road; Land registration number: 1139; Area: 0.490 acres; Compensation: National currency 10.056 yuan, etc.……

### Refugee Shelter Closed One Evening Refugees Dispersed Subsistence Is Not Maintained, Deadline for Leaving the Shelter Is the 15th, Dispersal Fee Is 50 Yuan per Adult

The establishment of refugee shelters in this port began when the Shanghai War broke out. The number of refugees accommodated reached more than 100,000 at most, and there were dozens of shelters. After more than four years of efforts, the refugees were continuously dispersed. Until recently, the number of people accommodated was only about 10,000, and only two shelters remained, namely: the Dunxin Road Shelter, directly managed by the Refugee Association, and the North Zhejiang Road Shelter, managed by the Charity Federation. The Dunxin Road Shelter accommodates about 5,000 people, and the North Zhejiang Road Shelter accommodates about 4,500 people. Now, both shelters have set a deadline to disperse before the 15th due to subsistence difficulties. The dispersal measures are as follows: each adult will be given a dispersal fee of 50 yuan, and each minor will be given 38 yuan. Those who leave Shanghai to return to their hometown will have the association collect the return home pass and the half-price certificate for boat and train travel expenses on their behalf. The refugees in both shelters have started to disperse rapidly, and more than 1,000 people have left the shelter after receiving the dispersal fee.

### The Paradise of Little Angels

— Xiao En

The nursery for working women sponsored by the Shanghai YWCA has just reached its first anniversary since its establishment in March last year. When the nursery was established, I visited it and there were only five children aged two to four. When I said goodbye, the person in charge of the nursery smiled and said to me: "This time next year, I hope our children can increase fivefold."

In order to know the current situation of the nursery, I chose a sunny morning and went to visit it. The nursery is a 洋房with two buildings, located at the intersection of Weihaiwei Road and Mullnam Road. As soon as I entered the gate, I saw more than ten innocent and lively children playing outdoors, some climbing on bamboo frames and some playing on slides.

After I entered the office, the person in charge of the nursery led me to visit. I learned that the number of children in the nursery has now increased to 36, with half staying in the nursery and half for daytime care. The kindergarten classroom is downstairs. The kindergarten in the nursery has many different places from ordinary kindergartens. Children can not only have lunch at the nursery, but the nursery also has iron beds for children to use during their lunch break. It is heard that kindergarten children can also stay overnight at the nursery.

There are three spacious bedrooms on the second floor, with clean bedding. Next to it is a isolation room full of sunlight. A two-year-old girl is sitting on the sickbed, watching pictures while listening to a kind nanny sitting on the chair. It is said that this child has a slight cough and is now isolated from the other children to avoid infection.

On the third floor, there are two children's playroom, one nanny's lounge, and one children's　watering room. Usually, there are more than 20 children, aged from about 20 months to 3 years old. Some are playing with building blocks, some are pushing wooden cars, and some are chasing and playing on the wide 洋台 in front of the playroom.

According to the person in charge of the nursery, the nursery is service-oriented, so according to the family economic situation and needs of working women, it has more than a dozen children with reduced fees. The fees paid by the children range from 31 yuan to 104 yuan. The nursery expenses are about 4,500 yuan per month, while the actual income is only 2,300 yuan. The deficit is subsidized by the YWCA's annual expenses.

In addition to three meals a day, the children in the nursery also have fruit and snacks once each. The food items are constantly changed, but they are all based on the principle of meeting the children's nutrition and hygiene.

Not only are working women increasingly feeling the value of sending their children to nursery schools, but housewives also want to reduce the burden on the family and cannot use too much female to take care of their children. They would rather send their children to nursery schools so that they can receive reasonable education.

### Remarks by the Swiss Consul General in Shanghai: Exchange of Officials Between the Two Countries - The Plan Has Indeed Been Drafted and Is Under Consultation. No Such Proposal Has Been Made for British and Dutch Nationals.

The English-language "China Press" reported that Mr. Fendant Li, Swiss Chargé d'Affaires in China and Consul General in Shanghai, told newspaper reporters in the city on the morning of the 7th that the concrete proposals made by the US and Japanese governments regarding the exchange of officials, Red Cross personnel, and newspaper reporters are now under consideration by the cabinets in Washington and Tokyo.

One Hundred US Nationals May Be Evacuated

Although it is too early to expect that this exchange program will be realized soon, the plan has indeed been drafted and is being discussed by the United States and Japan. If approved by both parties, about 120 US nationals currently residing in Shanghai may be evacuated from Shanghai in exchange for Japanese nationals of the same profession currently trapped in the United States. The Special Section of the Swiss Consulate General, which takes care of American interests and nationals within China, has received specific instructions regarding this matter. Therefore, the following categories of US nationals are requested to register at the Swiss Consulate Office on the 9th floor of the French Mail Steamer Company Building:

US Nationals Are Registered in Three Categories

US nationals are classified as follows: Diplomatic personnel, consulate personnel, and any other government officials, civil servants, and US nationals under surveillance; US representatives or personnel of the American Red Cross who wish to obtain the convenience stipulated in the exchange agreement; US newspaper reporters (including radio reporters and photographers) and their office staff, and their families are also included in the exchange. After the exchange of the above categories of US and Japanese nationals is completed, the US government hopes to submit specific proposals for the repatriation of non-official US civilians. This approach, of course, requires the exchange of US nationals residing in Japan and the occupied areas of China for Japanese nationals in the United States. The Swiss Consulate General will also compile a list of non-permanent US nationals who wish to be exchanged for repatriation to the United States for study.

Other US Nationals May Also Register

US nationals of the following categories who wish to be included in the exchange should register with the American Association at 8th floor of the Dalai Building; Those who happened to be visiting the occupied areas of China at the time of the outbreak of the war; Those who have a special status and are not included in the provisions of this notice, but are considered by the Swiss Consulate General to be included; County and municipal officials; Quasi-officials; Americans sent by public institutions; American employees of commercial firms and banks; Religious personnel; Scholars; Students; Researchers sent by the US government; Permanent US nationals who can also register include women, children, and those with special reasons.

The United Kingdom and the Netherlands Will Also Follow Suit

As for British and Dutch nationals, there is no exchange proposal yet, but it is currently being prepared. According to statistics, there are approximately 1,600 US nationals, 7,000 to 8,000 British nationals, and approximately 200 Dutch nationals currently under the protection of the Swiss Consulate in Shanghai. The Swiss Consulate General not only protects the nationals of the countries at war with Japan in Shanghai but also assists them in communicating with their compatriots in the occupied areas. The Special Section of the Swiss Consulate General, which takes care of the interests of the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Netherlands in China, has recently moved into the French Mail Steamer Company Building on the Bund in the French Concession. Because of its busy affairs, its staff has been slightly increased.

### Fruit Price Limits To Be Discussed Again

The French Concession authorities recently announced a list of goods with price limits, and the prices of the listed goods were clearly marked. Fruit was also one of them. According to the fruit industry, the French Concession authorities' restrictions on fruit prices, such as the restriction on tangerines to 2.3 yuan per pound, while the purchase price must be more than 3 yuan per pound, and some of them are damaged. Therefore, the price limit should be started by the fruit wholesale firms, and give retailers a considerable profit, so that it is not contrary to the authorities' intention to take care of the difficulties of merchants. It is reported that the Fruit Industry Association is scheduled to conduct consultations with the French Concession authorities today.

### Gamblers Are at the End of Their Rope, Colluding with Friends to Commit Crimes

Li Chaojiang, a young Ningbo native who used to be an employee of the British American Tobacco Company, recently lost his job. He took all the severance pay he received in a fanciful way and made a desperate bet at a gambling den, hoping to get lucky, but gradually lost everything. Unable to maintain his livelihood, he and Zhang Abao, a fellow villager who was on the run, started a life of robbery.

### Salvation Army's Fundraising Exceeds 100,000 Yuan

The annual fundraising campaign of the Salvation Army in this city has exceeded the 100,000 yuan mark yesterday morning. According to Colonel Walker, the leader of the Salvation Army, the reporter was informed that this fundraising campaign was powerfully promoted because Mrs. Li Wei of Radio France broadcast a special program in the past week, raising donations of 19,000 yuan. The listeners of the radio station donated very enthusiastically, either calling to pledge donations or sending the money. As a result, all the staff of the radio station and the five assistants sent by the Salvation Army were overwhelmed. Therefore, from today onwards, all donations will still be sent to the Sassoon Building on Renji Road, or call 13113, and someone will be sent to collect the money. At the same time, several Salvation Army staff members were busy collecting the pledged donations yesterday, and donations continued to come in. Although the fundraising for this year's Salvation Army has not reached its fixed target, the scope of the Salvation Army's relief work this year depends entirely on public donations. It is hoped that all sectors of society will pay attention and continue to contribute generously.

### Embezzling Goods, Intending to Set Up His Own Factory

Zhu Xianqi, the owner of the Xiangyun Hosiery Factory at No. 110, Lane 53, West Gate Road, entrusted Luo Changshou, a Shaoxing native at No. 5, Sanqing Lane, Caishi Road, with 1,280 dozen pairs of socks worth 5,000 yuan for processing from June to December last year. Unexpectedly, Luo secretly pledged the socks to obtain 3,000 yuan to purchase machinery, rent a house, and set up his own factory. Zhu found out about this and confronted Luo, who was evasive and indecisive. The day before yesterday, Zhu reported the matter to the French Concession Police, who dispatched detectives to arrest Luo and seize the pawn tickets. After interrogation, Luo admitted to the embezzlement. The head of the detectives ordered him to be detained for investigation and handling.

### Sealed Printed Matter Treated as Letters

Article 21 of the Postal Regulations stipulates that "newspapers, printed matter, trade contracts, commercial leaflets, samples, etc., if sealed tightly or not easily disassembled, shall be charged as letters regardless of whether their contents are letters." Article 142 stipulates that "if all or part of the mail is of a communicative nature, regardless of the method of writing, reproduction, or whether the exterior is sealed, it shall be charged as letters except as provided in paragraph 2 of Article 179." However, the public often seals newspapers, printed matter, etc., tightly or not easily visible, and sometimes carries letters inside, which is inconsistent with the provisions of the Postal Regulations. If found in the future, it will be handled as underpaid mail. The public is urged to pay attention and handle matters in accordance with the regulations.

### Impersonating Household Registration Investigators, Forcing the Sale of Household Registration Plates

Recently, some profiteers have disregarded the law and taken advantage of the opportunity to extort money from residents. The Public Concession and French Concession authorities have issued notices to conduct household registration in order to maintain public order and regulate food supply. The registration has recently been completed. These people are now taking advantage of this opportunity and daring to impersonate employees of the Public Works Department to sell so-called household registration frames to residents and shops, selling each frame for two yuan, one for each household, and not allowing any excuses for refusal. The residents in the Dexing Lane area of Peng Road were forced to buy a lot the other day because they did not know the truth. However, when they arrived at a certain household, the resident of that household worked in the Public Works Department and knew that the department did not send anyone to sell these frames. He secretly reported to the Huisi Police Station, which ordered detectives to arrest three suspects, seize several white frames, account books, cash, and other items, and take them to the police station for investigation according to law. In the future, if there is any such situation, residents are urged to immediately report to the police station.

Residents in the Public Concession, in order to protect their own interests, should immediately organize baojia self-defense groups. It should be known that this is not to ask the residents in the concession to engage in things that they do not need to do. This is only a matter of residents in the concession mutually protecting common interests, so that terrorist incidents in the concession will be completely eliminated and citizens can live in peace. Residents in the concession should abide by the proclamation issued by the Japanese naval authorities on December 4 last year and cooperate with the authorities to eliminate terrorist incidents. Residents who want to avoid this pain and loss can only do their best to assist the Public Works Department in maintaining the safety and order of the concession. If they see anyone with suspicious behavior, they should immediately report it to the authorities. At the same time, all hotels should conduct a strict investigation of travelers before registering them. If there are any suspicious travelers, they should immediately report them to the authorities. In short, residents in the concession who witness or hear about terrorist incidents should shout "Terror" loudly to inform nearby residents and pedestrians, assist police officers, and do their best to pursue and arrest the perpetrators, or report to the nearest military and police authorities. Residents who have telephones installed should immediately report to the authorities when such incidents occur. Residents and pedestrians should especially remember the appearance and clothing of the perpetrators when terrorist incidents occur, as well as the direction of their escape, and automatically report to the military and police when they arrive to facilitate the arrest. At this difficult time, residents should not harbor the selfish thought of "not minding their own business" or shrinking and evading responsibility. Because terrorist incidents can occur at any time in the vicinity, and residents are at risk of being blocked at any time, assisting the authorities in eliminating terrorist activities is for their own benefit and economic considerations. All of our residents should do their best to take on the responsibilities of members of the baojia self-defense groups.

### Trolley Buses Extend to Haifang Road

Since yesterday morning, the above three trolley bus lines have been extended to Haifang Road. The same is true for Route 24, which connects to the French Concession.

### Second Lecture of Agricultural Science Series: Agricultural Machinery

The Shanghai Chinese Christian Youth Association held the second lecture of the "Agricultural Science Series" at 4:00 pm yesterday. Professor Wu Liuqing, the speaker, gave a lecture entitled "Do You Know How to Use Agricultural Machinery?" The main points are summarized as follows: "The use of machinery in agriculture is still very rare in our country, but in European and American industrial countries, the statistics show that the numbers are not much different from those in industry. Chinese agriculture has always relied on human labor. If we calculate it, the labor cost is very considerable. If we can use natural power in the future, we can save a lot of labor. Generally speaking, the machinery used in agriculture is much simpler than that used in industry. The power adopted includes the steam engine, which is similar to the locomotive, such as a four-horsepower grinding machine, which can be equal to the work efficiency of eighty people. The setting and management are very convenient, and the fuel can be taken locally. The second type is the charcoal machine. The third type is the hydraulic machine, but it must be used on slopes or riverbanks, and it cannot be used on flat ground. The fourth type is the windmill, which is made of wood into a giant windmill. The power of the wind can be used on the farmland on both sides of the Huangpu River. The structure is simple and easy to move. The fifth type is electricity. Near the city, as long as the power lines are connected, electricity can be used. I have seen that in European countries, the use of electricity in agriculture is already very common." At this point, he talked about plows for cultivating the land. The old-fashioned plows in China are light and practical, and are welcomed by farmers. Foreign plows do not use oxen to plow, but use machine power. Unless it is a larger farm, it can be applied. Otherwise, it is not as suitable as plows pulled by oxen. Wu also described in detail the new-style machines used in American agriculture, such as irrigation machines, soil compacting machines, fertilizer applicators, seeding machines, transplanting machines, inter-row weeding machines, water lifting and drainage machines, harvesters, threshers, seed selection machines, drying machines, transporting machines, feeding machines, mulberry cutting machines, tea baking machines, and sugarcane squeezing machines. Finally, he discussed the life of agricultural machinery, as well as repairs, storage, consumption, insurance, etc., all of which were calculated using accounting methods. He finally urged those who use agricultural machinery to pay attention to reform and write reports for public reference.

In addition to occasional customer interest in bran, dealers were more active. Sanxin large-bag bran opened at 73.5 yuan, then 74 yuan, 4.2 yuan, 5 yuan, to 75.2 yuan, but in the evening some profit-taking dealers returned, closing again at 74.5 yuan, with over 5,000 bags traded.

### Rice Prices See Both Increases and Decreases

The domestic rice market is chaotic, with both increases and decreases. Early thin rice buying is weak, with prices slightly down by 3-4 yuan. Early rice is from 280 yuan to 277.5 yuan, thin rice from 279 yuan to 277 yuan, Shipu especially thin opened at 285 yuan, Suzhou secondary japonica opened at 298 yuan, and especially high-quality 锡粳 must be priced as high as 310 yuan. The street sales of various types of Yin Yuan are lively, and prices continue to rise. Jinshan white yuan is from 290 yuan to 291 yuan, Wuxi white yuan is 289 yuan, and Liangbang Yin Yuan is 282 yuan. There are also rumors of new restrictions on the transport of domestic rice, making it difficult to imagine the resulting hardship for the people's food supply.

### Black Dates Increase

Black dates have recently become more expensive due to exchange rates, so prices have tightened. Yesterday, Tianjin dealers released over 200 bags, with Boping especially large date king priced at 480 yuan, date king at 460 yuan, date head at 380 yuan to 360 yuan, and Gaozhuang at 300 yuan.

### Kelp Greatly Increases

Kelp supply is dwindling, and market inventories are nearly depleted. Only a small amount is still sealed in foreign warehouses, and shipments are expected to be released soon. Yesterday, the market was opened by dealers, and the price increase was extraordinarily sharp. Wudun kelp opened at 517 yuan to 535 yuan to 568 yuan, and fine Xilan kelp at 655 yuan, an increase of over half, truly an unprecedented high price. Kelp that usually sells for only a few tens of yuan is beyond calculation.

### Orchid Bamboo Branches Turn Tight Due to Shortage

Bamboo branches have recently become short due to limited arrivals, so although sales are not active, dealers' interest in buying is higher, so market prices have tightened. Yesterday, sellers called for an increase of 20-30 yuan.

### Prices Soar Into the Clouds

Fragrant mushrooms and winter mushrooms are increasingly expensive due to dwindling supply, and market prices are rising daily. Yesterday, domestic Lanxi mushrooms were at 3,000 yuan, Jian mushrooms the same price, Tunxi mushrooms at 3,500 yuan, East Asian fragrant mushrooms at 4,400 yuan, and top-grade winter mushrooms at 7,500 yuan, and lower-grade at 5,500 yuan, truly soaring into the clouds.

### Bananas

— Gao Jiannong

The more common name for this tropical plant in ancient China was "sweet banana". Its Latin name is Musa paradisiaca, which means "fairy in paradise." Why did it get this beautiful name? Originally, the taste of its fruit was so fragrant, sweet, and exquisite that it could refresh the heart and linger on the palate, so that ancient Caucasians simply regarded it as the delicious fruit that Eve, the ancestor of mankind, used to satisfy her hunger in paradise! Indeed, its charming flavor and rich nutrients make it an ideal food. Even now, there are still many people in the tropics who use it as their only daily food.

Leaving aside the unconfirmed rumors above, the banana is actually a plant that was first noticed and utilized by the most ancient nomadic peoples. The reason is that it grows naturally in areas such as southern Asia, the South Sea Islands, the Philippine Islands, and the Sunda Islands. Its numerous varieties, ancient names, anecdotes, and rhymes that have been passed down through the ages are enough to prove its long and close relationship with human life. In its shadow, the carefree primitive people enjoy the pleasures of family life, supporting the old and leading the young! Beside its trunk, those leisurely ancient philosophers, taking advantage of their leisure, pondered the problems of life! Its shape and form must have been something that ancient humans were so familiar with.

Some anthropologists believe that by studying the origin of the banana plant, the problem of the "origin of the American race" can also be solved. Since the cradle of this plant is in southern Asia, and then it spread from there to India, China, eastern and western Africa, various islands in the Pacific Ocean, and the Americas in the New World, then from the ancient relationship between bananas and the people of the Old World, and the fact that people in the New World are only in the initial stages of discussion with it, the people of the Americas must have migrated from the Old World. The transplanting of bananas to the Americas must have been before the Spanish conquered it in the 16th century. Because in 1531 AD, when Pizarro landed in the Inca Empire in Peru with a group of rugged soldiers, the local natives offered him ripe bananas. However, according to the research of the authoritative scholar and plant geographer De Candolle, the cultivation of this plant in the New World does not exceed three or four centuries, which means that it was not long after the discovery of the New World.

The banana belongs to monocotyledonous plants, and is a very great herb, that is, the cousin of the plantain that we sometimes see in Shanghai. Its 假茎 can grow to more than 20 feet tall (there is one that only grows to four or five feet), and is entirely formed by the sheaths left after the leaves fall, embracing each other, like a 鱗片. Therefore, the Song Dynasty scholar 庄季裕 explained the meaning of plantain in the 《邹阳集》, "蕉... one leaf spreads and one leaf withers, so it is called plantain. Popularly speaking, drying things is called 'ba', and 'ba' also means withered." It has eight to ten large leaves with feathery veins growing from the top, which are alternate and shaped like long ellipses, with a shiny surface and a slightly white underside. And its leaves are very large, so that Ji Han of the Jin Dynasty said in the 《南方草木状》that it can "grow to one zhang or seven or eight chi long, and more than one or two chi wide!" In the summer, it draws out a very long flower spike from the leaves and hangs downwards. The flowers are irregular, light yellow, bisexual, and surrounded by a large purple bract that is as beautiful as petals. The perianth has six pieces in total, arranged in two whorls. There are six stamens, usually five with anthers that have pollen, and one that is incomplete and has no medicine. The ovary is inferior, with two chambers, and when ripe, it is a berry, which only contains aborted, that is, immature seeds.

When it comes to the berries when the banana ripens, which is also called "banana", there is really a drawback of confusing it with the plant itself! Ji Han said in 《南方草木状》: "...The seeds are large and each is a chamber, connected to each other, sweet and delicious, and can also be secretly stored." It also said: "The fruit follows the flower, each flower is one bunch, each with six seeds, one after another." (To be continued)

Spring and Autumn

### On the Battlefront of Life

— Xiang Zhi

Today is the day for women, but "everyone together" can also be considered everyone's holiday. Since women have recognized their place in society, their cries have finally shaken all people, people who have constantly created feudal shackles in the past. Now, even when they are making them, or thinking about it, they have to widen their eyes a little.

Some time ago, someone shouted, "Let the women do it." This does not mean that men are "old and useless", or tired and retiring, but it makes everyone a little surprised, the slogan is a bit too fresh. However, since the dawn of humanity, women have done many things. The history of the advancement of women-centered society has been recognized by historians and does not need to be calculated. Later, countless unnamed women created the stepping stones for the success of male heroes, but their history has never listed their blood and sweat, even if there is, it is nothing more than "the model of women remains" or "to follow virtue".

But society is progressing, and women are finally raising their heads in various fields, especially in production relations. Many men only applaud, but on their own front, they just "wave the flag" and engage in "fashion shows". So, they constantly strive and constantly work hard.

Today, everyone is equal. In addition to having the right to inherit property, everyone has the obligation to fulfill their duties in various professional fields and production departments. This obligation may have various objective limitations, but everyone knows that this is a part of the social problem.

At this time and place, the term "vase" is just the "achievement" of men, and it is enough to show their frivolous appearance. On the road, in front of the rice store, there are already brush-written slogans saying "Men line up on the left" and "Women line up on the right." Women dare not fall behind in the ranks of survival to fight for living resources. They may squeeze out more blood and sweat for their husbands and children. This is different from Tolstoy's era of serfdom. Women and men are not divided, that's all.

### Thoughts After Reading the Newspaper

— Qin Ren

Previously, there was a letter in this newspaper's "Social Services" column titled "Shaoxing Wine is Swindled." After reading it carefully, this "method" seems very familiar. Like rice and coal balls, they often go missing on the way. Moreover, you have to pay some "handling fees" at the location they specify. Then the delivery man quarrels about gambling money, and the person paying the money quarrels about where the goods are. After disturbing the neighbors, after a detailed investigation, it turns out that an unknown hand took it away. The culprit cannot be caught on the spot. Even if you sue, who will be the defendant?

When this kind of "scam" was first discovered, it was naturally news. Fathers sued sons, husbands sued wives... Don't be a fool for the second time. However, until yesterday, I don’t know how many families have recognized their bad luck, and a bottle of Shaoxing wine still flies away. If you have thoughts after reading the newspaper, you will definitely bring out the ancient saying "There are only thieves for a thousand years, but no one to prevent thieves for a thousand years." This ancient saying is just a sigh. How to prevent it is still left up to one's nature.

Naturally, there are also those who think further; but once you think about it, the problem becomes big: the first is the high cost of rice and firewood, the second is the large number of unemployed, and the third... then you sigh and say "Forget it, forget it."

### The Mood of Rainy Days

— Rooster

It is said that: "Before the Awakening of Insects, thunder is heard, and it will not be sunny for forty-nine days." Unfortunately, this year there was thunder before the Awakening of Insects. More unfortunately, the saying came true. The weather is always weirdly unpredictable. I regret not bringing an umbrella as soon as I take off my galoshes. When going out, whether it rains or not, you must be fully armed. So, with galoshes on your feet and an umbrella in your hand, you hit the street. Maybe God is deliberately playing a joke and it doesn't rain. Running on the street with galoshes and an umbrella looks too "fire hazard".

Sitting at home, looking up at the sky, the sky is gray and not white, as annoying as the dorm mother in a girls' school. It is said that the most annoying thing in a girls' school is the dorm mother. Because she interferes with the students' freedom of action and the privacy of their letters. And occasionally if she has a boyfriend, she must get to the bottom of it. Her face is always like a widow's face, and you never see a hint of a smile. If you compare this weather to the face of a widow, then this rain is just like a widow's tears. Su Dongpo's "Ode to the Red Cliff" has "weeping lonely boat woman." It is said that a widow's tears are the most thought-provoking. This rain is so depressing that everyone becomes sentimental. Years of frustration, annoyance, and pain all come to mind. It's as if the world is dead, and only the pattering sound of rain is striking one's lonely heartstrings. How lonely is this? How empty? And how monotonous?

Li Shangyin's poem: "Keeping the remaining lotus to listen to the sound of rain." We can imagine that in early autumn, it is cool, lying on a couch, listening to the cold rain beating the remaining lotus, pattering. It is a poetic realm, it is a pictorial realm. It is really a romantic thing to do on a rainy day. It's a pity that at this time and place, it's not only not early autumn, but also difficult to find a pond. What's more, every day, firewood and rice are exhausting, so where can you have the leisure to lie down and listen to the rain? With the vicissitudes of life, the sound of rain also has a sense of past and present.

### Shared Boat in Storms

— He Jia Zhi

(2) Sorrow and Joy

Weicheng no longer wanted to sleep. He busied himself finding his leather shoes and returning the coat that Guofang had sent to him. Guoqi said, "What are you rushing for? Wait for the boatman to call us again. It's not too late to get ready then. You haven't brought any luggage anyway. Let's talk some more. It's been five or six years since we last met. It was alright before we met, but now that we have met, it feels like we are reluctant to part. Let's talk some more." Weicheng said, "Alright. What else do you brother and sister want to ask me?" Guofang said, "Are you hungry? Have some more biscuits." Weicheng shook his head and said, "I'm not hungry." Strangely enough, when he didn't want to talk, he could come up with bits and pieces of conversation. But when he wanted to talk, he felt that it could be saved for when they met again. The three of them looked at each other without saying a word. Only the light from the glass lamp reflected on the glass windows on both sides, and looking out, it seemed like there were lights outside the glass windows too.

After Guoqi's instructions, the boatman's rowing seemed to have become less energetic. The sound of the boat heading into the water was no longer "whoosh, whoosh, whoosh." Finally, they heard it being rowed into the city river. The boatman told Guoqi, with only two words: "Arrived!" Weicheng pulled open the inward-opening glass window and looked out, saying, "It's really here. Good, I have to go ashore." Guoqi said, "I won't see you ashore." Guofang touched the umbrella and said, "Brother, why don't you ask if it's dawn yet? You have to wait for dawn to go up. There are no streetlights in the market town." Guoqi, like Weicheng, peered out the window and said, "The east is slightly bright. It should be dawn soon. Weicheng, sit for a while longer, and wait for them to stop the boat before deciding what to do. Speaking of streetlights, I have to scold those country gentlemen again. They don't pay attention to the facilities in the villages and towns at all. All they know is to exploit the people."

Weicheng was putting on his leather shoes, and he stepped into the front cabin in one stride, laughing, "During the New Year, when you come to my house, we'll take our wine glasses and scold the local officials to our heart's content. The ills of society are everywhere, and Huagang and Shuangqiao are the same." As he finished speaking, the boat seemed to bump into the boat next door, and someone on the neighboring boat immediately started scolding, "Are you blind? If you can't row a boat, what are you rowing for? The east is turning white, can't you see with those thieving eyes? Your eyeballs must be growing in your pants." The boatman on this side, not willing to give in after hitting someone, started scolding back. Weicheng recognized that the person scolding on the neighboring boat was Hongqi Zhang Zhang Shurong, so he leaned out and called out, "Is that Zhang Shurong? I'm here. Your boat arrived first." Zhang Shurong hurriedly called out to Young Master Ye, and he suddenly kept all the scolding he had in his stomach to himself.

### Tea Drinking

— Yu Shu

In Lu Yu's "The Classic of Tea," the types of tea are determined by the earliness or lateness of the picking: "First is tea, second is [...], third is [...], fourth is ming, fifth is chuan." Nowadays, when people drink tea, the wealthy only know about imported "Lipton," and the domestically produced "Qimen." For black tea, nothing else will do. For green tea, everyone favors "Longjing" and "Yuqian." Sitting in a tea room with a stand in hand, one finds joy in this. Those of a lower class, the tea in taverns and tea houses, before and after meals; the tea in offices, parlors, and attic rooms, although also coming from famous tea-producing regions and purchased from well-known tea shops, when one investigates the purpose of drinking tea, it is merely to wash away the greasiness in the stomach. As for the taste of the tea, the drinker is indifferent.

In the countryside, the teahouse is the only place of entertainment for men. Old and young sit together, talking about everything under the sun, and "The Classic of Mountains and Seas" will never be finished. In the Zhejiang area, those who sit in teahouses are regarded as good-for-nothings. In the four villages near Shanghai, women work in the fields, while their husbands are in small teahouses, vigorously arguing over "one foreign shovel and one justice," not distinguishing between rights and obligations, as if it were a matter of course. Women work like cattle and horses without complaint, while men are shameless. I have often witnessed this situation on the west bank of the Huangpu River. The old-style teahouses in Shanghai were all places where merchants gathered, called tea parties. They gathered at a certain time every day to discuss quantities and prices, and once a word was given, millions were traded, which was quite ancient. When gangsters negotiated deals, they invariably invited the other party to tea at a certain place. At that time, both sides were heavily armed, with a murderous aura. If they disagreed, fists and iron rulers would be raised together, and teacups and teapots would fly. But the teahouse owner need not worry, all losses would be taken care of by someone. Before the war, the teahouses near the City God Temple in Nanshi were a good place to enjoy tea. Although the storytelling was vulgar and the actors pretended to be mute, regardless of the content, listening to the jokes and interjections could bring a smile to one's face.

Cantonese people take tea more seriously than eating. Whether it is morning tea or afternoon tea, scholars, farmers, workers, and businessmen all take a break. The Cantonese in Shanghai still maintain this custom. In the tea rooms, one often sees compatriots from the southern country wearing short clothes, drinking tea and chatting. The early and afternoon tea seats in Cantonese restaurants are mostly frequented by non-Cantonese. They do not come to drink tea, but mostly for the dim sum. Now the situation has changed greatly. Everyone is unwilling to eat dim sum made of corn flour. Although there is music and singing to liven things up, there are still very few tea drinkers.

### Horse Lantern Tune

— Ze Fu

In the Zhejiang area, every New Year, there is something called a horse lantern parade, where teams perform in the courtyards of houses. Each team has four runners, all children, dressed as two boys and two girls. The horses are made of bamboo strips, covered with silk or similar fabrics, either yellow or white. The horse is divided into two sections, one in front of the child and one behind. The child holds the horse's head in one hand and a horse whip in the other, pretending to ride a horse. It is called a lantern because tallow can be burned inside the horse, but now no one burns it. When running, there are drummers to keep the beat, mostly advancing and retreating, returning to the original position after a few times, each occupying one side, facing each other. After running, they sing songs, accompanied by the erhu and pipa, which is the so-called horse lantern tune. The tune is usually in seven-character quatrains, with the last two lines repeated, and these two lines have a "ai yo yi ai yo xu" melody as an interlude. They sing and run in this cycle, from four to more than ten stanzas. The content of the songs is nothing more than love songs between brothers and sisters, such as the first stanza of "Washing White Gauze": "Sister is washing white gauze by the river, she lost her hairpin head under the water. I call my cousin to scoop it up, ai yo yi ai yo, I call my cousin to scoop it up."
