Tokyo, 4th (Domei News Agency) - Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the Japanese Navy has achieved unprecedented victories in the Pacific and Indian Oceans. In North China, Central China, and South China, it has also cooperated with the Army forces to repeatedly establish military achievements. From the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War last December to June of this year, the overall battle results of the Japanese Navy's operations against Chongqing are: Losses to the Chongqing Army: 8,231 killed, 1,236 captured, 110 ships sunk, and 895 ships captured.

The battle situation is described in detail as follows: In North China, the Japanese naval forces, at the beginning of the war on December 8th, first took over enemy interests and ships in North China and dispatched warships to patrol the coast of North China for more than a month. Afterward, they cooperated with the Army forces to fight in various places along the coast of Shandong and Jiangsu. In late April, they also defeated the Communist forces in Shidao, Shandong. In Central China, after the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the Japanese naval forces first sank the British gunboat Petrel berthed in the Huangpu River and arrested the American gunboat Wake. Other enemy ships were also captured at the same time. They also cooperated with the Army forces to peacefully enter the Shanghai Public Concession, take over British and American interests in Pudong, and continue to search for enemy ships along the coast. In mid-March, they cooperated with the Army to launch the Taihu Operation. In mid-May, they achieved even greater victories in the Poyang Lake Operation. In South China, after the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the Japanese naval air force in that area first bombed British military facilities in Hong Kong and sent ships to monitor the British fleet.

### Japanese Military Administration in Java Manages All Cultivation Enterprises

Surabaya, 4th (Domei News Agency) - In order to maintain important cultivation enterprises in Java and protect the lives of farmers and plantation workers, the Japanese military administration here has decided to manage the cinchona, coffee, rubber, and tea enterprises, as well as their production, storage, and sales. The authorities recently issued the following statement on this matter: "Java's sugar, cinchona, tea, coffee, rubber, etc., are cultivation enterprises that occupy a superior position in the world. Most of the products are exported to the world. After the outbreak of the war, trade was cut off, and the operation of these enterprises has become difficult. However, if left to their own devices, not only will their excellent quality deteriorate and the plantations will become desolate, but it will also make future industrial reconstruction more difficult. Furthermore, millions of workers will lose their jobs, which may cause social problems. In view of this, the military administration authorities have decided to manage these essential cultivation enterprises and establish a cultivation enterprise management corporation as the operating mechanism to take perfect measures to maintain and operate the cultivation enterprises."

### Unprecedented Bloody Battle Unfolds East of Kursk: German and Soviet Land and Air Forces Have Comparable Strength; Fierce Fighting Also in the Kharkov Area

Fuhrer Headquarters, 4th (Haitong News Agency) - The German High Command announced this afternoon that the resistance of the remaining Soviet troops on the Khersones Peninsula southwest of Sevastopol has been crushed, and the annihilation of the besieged stragglers is nearing completion. In the area between Kharkov and Kursk, the German army and its allies defeated the Soviet army along the entire line. The German flanking offensive has surrounded most of the enemy army, and mechanized units are now advancing rapidly towards the Lai River.

Bear City, 4th (Domei News Agency) - Moscow admitted last night that Sevastopol had been lost. From the looks of things, the German summer offensive seems to have begun between Kursk and Kharkov. This battle is the largest in scale this year. The German army is attacking Kursk, Belgorod, and Volchansk simultaneously in three routes, using hundreds of tanks and many aircraft. Fierce fighting has been going on in the Kursk area for five days, and its intensity is increasing daily. It has also evolved into a large tank battle. The fighting in the Belgorod area is also mainly focused on tanks.

Stockholm, Sweden, 3rd (Havas News Agency) - According to Berlin news, an unprecedented bloody battle has been fought east of Kursk in the past six days, but in terms of the entire battle, it is still in the preliminary stage. Berlin compares the battle in this area to the Battle of Knightsbridge in Libya, because the Battle of Knightsbridge was actually a prelude to the German army's great victory in Tobruk in North Africa. A large number of German air force and armored divisions are concentrated on the Kursk front, and there is no doubt that a major battle will take place in this area. The German side does not deny the stubborn resistance of the Red Army. Fresh Red Army troops, equipped with new and sophisticated weapons, have been sent to the area. The Red Army now has a good air force, and the strength of the land and air forces of the warring parties is almost equal. However, it is expected that this battle will still be decided by the superiority of the air force and tanks. So far, the German army has achieved local success, and the Red Army admits that it has had to retreat to new defensive lines. The German army is still in the dominant position, but the Red Army claims that General Timoshenko's troops have broken through several German positions. As for the fighting in other areas of the Eastern Front, the fighting between Belgorod and Volchansk in the Kharkov area is more important. General Bock's troops of the German army, after resting for a few days, resumed their offensive in full force. In addition, the German air force has been extremely active in recent days, constantly bombing Soviet transportation lines. Among them, the city of Voronezh was bombed particularly severely. Leningrad and the port of Kronstadt have also been bombarded by German artillery and aircraft. In addition, the German forces on the Finnish front are concentrating near Louhi in order to spy on the Murmansk railway, thereby cutting off the British and American supply lines to the Soviet Union.

Somewhere on the Ukrainian border, 3rd (Havas News Agency) - Fierce fighting is taking place in the southern part of the Eastern Front, from Kursk to the Sea of Azov. The long-awaited general offensive is underway. The Voronezh-Rostov railway line has been bombed by German aircraft, and the tracks have been destroyed in five places. The main goal of the German army seems to be to encircle the Red Army defending the Donets Basin from the north. The German army east of Kursk, which was once forced to abandon some positions in Seym and Ogol, launched a counteroffensive last night. A strong armored unit broke through the Red Army's position and, after fierce fighting, approached the upper reaches of the Bituq River, 40 miles south of Voronezh. This morning, fierce fighting also broke out in the Lokotovatova area, 20 miles east of Ogol. German troops in the Kupyansk area have also crossed the Bilosotnyaga River and reached the Voronezh-Rostov railway line. East of Izyum, the German army is advancing along the left bank of the Donets River and has reached Slavyanochask, its purpose seemingly to protect the German right flank from attack. The German air force has been active all day. The Red Army also has many airfields available for use near the front, so the German-Soviet air combat is unusually magnificent.

### Egypt's Fate About to be Decided: Fierce Battle Southeast of El Alamein; Part of British Reinforcements Arrive at the Front; Germany and Italy Announce Repulse of British Counter-Offensive

Allied News Agency, Xiong City, 4th Dispatch: According to news from Cairo, although the British Eighth Army in the El Alamein area of Egypt launched a counter-offensive against the Axis forces, it has not yet mounted a full-scale offensive. It is said that General Rommel still maintains the initiative about sixty miles from Alexandria. Another report claims that some Axis forces have invaded within fifteen to twenty miles of Alexandria, and British forces have retreated from El Alamein towards the mouth of the Nile. However, confirmation is sought from either the Axis or British side. British sources acknowledge that Rommel's troops have been fighting around El Alamein for three days and have made some progress. Berlin and Rome, on the other hand, have announced that the British counter-offensive has been repulsed, and the fighting is progressing east and south of El Alamein, with intense combat. A British military communiqué from Cairo vaguely stated that the next forty-eight hours will determine the fate of Egypt. It also stated that yesterday, British forces attacked the Axis forces advancing east in the El Alamein area, leading to an unprecedented battle in the Middle East involving land and air forces. Fierce air combat continued throughout the day.

Allied News Agency, Xiong City, 4th Dispatch: It is reported that German and Italian forces have won the Battle of El Alamein and have advanced to within fifteen to twenty miles of the British naval base at Alexandria.

Allied News Agency, Xiong City, Reported on the 4th: According to a Reuters correspondent with the British Eighth Army today, the British artillery used in Egypt is still no match for the German heavy artillery. Officers and soldiers of the Eighth Army unanimously acknowledge that the Axis forces' ability to break through the British lines south of El Alamein on the first day of the offensive was largely due to this. The German heavy artillery has a caliber of up to 105 millimeters, and there are a large number of these guns.

Haitong Agency, Stan Fort, 4th Dispatch: According to news from Cairo, Egyptian Prime Minister Nahas announced yesterday that Cairo will soon implement a blackout.

Havas Agency, London, 4th Dispatch: Today, the London Times commented on the Egyptian battle situation, stating that although the enemy has not lost the initiative in the Egyptian battle, the final outcome is not yet determined. Although the German army is extremely agile, its existing supply lines are too long, which is a disadvantage. British forces have been forced to retreat to strong defensive positions, so their future is not hopeless, but the situation remains serious. British forces must make their utmost efforts.

Havas Agency, Cairo, 3rd Dispatch: Officials announced tonight that Allied forces captured a batch of Axis officers and soldiers during fierce fighting on the northern front in Egypt today. According to the latest news from the front, German forces have launched another fierce attack on British positions in El Alamein. Details have not yet been obtained.

Havas Agency, Swiss Capital, 3rd Dispatch: According to news received indirectly from the North African front, the Egyptian battle situation this evening is roughly as follows: 1. The Axis advance towards Alexandria is not as rapid as the initial capture of Mersa Matruh. 2. El Alamein is still firmly held by Allied forces. 3. British reinforcements transferred from Palestine to join the fighting on the front have begun to exert their strength. However, the "Neue Zürcher Zeitung" published a Berlin dispatch stating that Germany announced that General Rommel's forces have approached Alexandria and denied British reports that German forces were blocked at El Alamein. According to the newspaper's observation, the Axis military operations are not limited to the northern coastal area and Alexandria alone, and it is possible that they have divided their forces to directly attack Cairo. The joint declaration by Germany and Italy respecting Egypt's independence is probably a prelude to this military action. Furthermore, a correspondent for the "Journal de Genève" in Rome reported that a division of Italian assault troops had broken through the British lines on the Egyptian coast between the coast and the Qattara Depression, and then joined with German forces to advance north and encircle El Alamein. Another unit of German forces advanced towards Alexandria to pursue the retreating British forces, while a unit of Italian forces advanced towards the Qattara Depression. A division of the British Ninth Army stationed in Palestine has arrived at the front to reinforce, but the main force is still east of the Nile. In summary, reports from all sides indicate that the Egyptian battle situation has not yet reached a decisive outcome. The British plan, led by Auchinleck, is to buy time so that reinforcements can arrive in time. At this critical moment for the British forces, every hour is of great significance to the situation.

Haitong Agency, Ankara, 4th Dispatch: Recent dispatches report frequent air raids over Alexandria, and British forces are making final preparations for a last-ditch stand. The situation in the city is extremely tense, and the Egyptians are especially fearful of the British preparations for battle, as fighting in densely populated areas will inevitably harm innocent civilians.

British Ninth Army Deploys Southeast of Alexandria

Havas Agency, Swiss Capital, 3rd Dispatch: According to reports from foreign correspondents published in local newspapers, European countries believe that Alexandria cannot be defended for long, and British forces will resist in the Nile Delta and along the coast. The "National News" carried a dispatch from its Berlin correspondent stating that Axis forces are now only fifteen miles from Alexandria. Rumors that the British have decided to destroy the water gates in the Nile Delta are of no great significance, as the water level is currently very low, so even if they are destroyed, there will be little impact. The "Basler Nachrichten" also carried a dispatch from its Rome correspondent stating that Italy believes that victory in the Battle of El Alamein will ultimately belong to the Axis forces, and British forces are collapsing towards the Nile. The fate of the British forces in Egypt has already been determined. The newspaper's correspondent in the Turkish capital also reported that Turkish military figures do not believe that British forces will mount a strong resistance before Alexandria, and that the fall of this key port does not mean the fall of all of Egypt. The British will still exploit the geographical advantages of the Nile Delta to reorganize their resistance after the fall of Alexandria. A large part of the Ninth Army has arrived in Egypt from the Syria mandate and is deploying southeast of Alexandria. Furthermore, according to a dispatch from the Swedish capital, the Egyptian war may change the entire war situation. The United Kingdom and the United States, due to their strong industrial capabilities, may be able to gain the upper hand one day, but they currently have no clear advantage. The continued advance of the Axis forces in North Africa is of great historical significance. In the "Unity Daily," a military expert's article argued that the British Commander-in-Chief in Egypt should still take various measures to defend the region. The article stated, "If General Auchinleck decides not to defend the Nile, he can only continue to retreat eastward to concentrate his forces to hold the Suez Canal. However, the Nile Delta constitutes a defensive line in western Egypt that is 150 miles long. The area has a dense network of transportation lines, and defenses can be completed within a few days, while the attackers have come from afar and are far from their base. Therefore, it is most likely that British forces will deploy along the Nile River between Cairo and Aswan. The threat to the Suez Canal is not immediate. Before attacking eastern Egypt, Axis forces must first occupy western Egypt and deploy there. Therefore, the most important question at present is to determine how many reinforcements General Auchinleck has transferred."

Haitong Agency, Turkish Capital, 4th Dispatch

Cairo dispatches report that Egyptian King Farouk held a long meeting with Prime Minister Nahas yesterday afternoon. General Stone and representatives from the British Middle East Command also participated. The contents of the meeting were not announced.

The meeting lasted a long time. Nahas then held meetings with the Minister of Defense and the Governor of Alexandria, who had flown in from Alexandria. It is widely believed that the discussions concerned the evacuation of residents from Alexandria and certain areas of the Nile Delta.

Havas Agency, Hungarian Capital, 3rd Dispatch: The "Lloyd's" newspaper here carried a dispatch from the Turkish capital stating that the Egyptian government has decided to evacuate public institutions from Alexandria and implement the evacuation of civilians. Workers from various industries in the port have left on special trains. Other civilians are also preparing to evacuate in batches. Furthermore, Egyptian King Farouk ordered Prime Minister Nahas to deliver a memorandum to the British Ambassador and the local British military commander, but the contents have not been released.

Of that amount, $60,000 was 10% of her earnings and $17,658 was interest.

### Sevastopol Reduced to Ruins

Haitong Agency, Berlin, 4th Dispatch: According to German sources, when the Battle of Sevastopol began, German air raids and artillery bombardments reduced Sevastopol to ruins. Its harbor is filled with the wreckage of sunken destroyers, cruisers, other warships, and merchant ships. There is not a single intact building in the entire city. Only the spires of churches and mosques are undamaged. All forts and defenses have been reduced to rubble.

Havas Agency, Berlin, 3rd Dispatch: Detailed information regarding the Battle of Sevastopol has been received here today. The course of this battle and terrain are outlined below. German forces began their attack on this fortress on June 7th, but until June 23rd, they had not achieved any significant results. The German-Romanian forces only crossed the Chorhun River and approached the defensive lines established by the Red Army on the Sapun Heights. However, on the 29th, the situation changed. German forces crossed the Severnaya Bay, and after repelling the enemy, the German 54th Army occupied an important military strategic position. Although the Red Army resisted fiercely, the German-Romanian forces broke through a gap on the eastern side of the port, and the central area of the region was threatened. At the same time, the Romanian army in the south, after occupying the city of Balaklava, continued to advance northward and brought the coastal area under control. The German air force and Italian navy also prevented the Soviet fleet from transporting ammunition and reinforcements. By the night of the 30th, German pressure intensified, and they launched an attack into the city from the east. The next morning, the Red Army hesitated. The German air force and artillery then launched a fierce bombardment on the Red Army's final defensive line, inflicting the final blow. At noon, German forces were engaged in mopping-up operations in the Inkerman Bay area to clear out the remnants of the Red Army, while street fighting also broke out in the city. The Red Army resisted resolutely, vowing to fight to the death, but by the afternoon, the Red Army's resistance was completely crushed by the German forces. The entire city was on fire and is still burning today. Although the German-Romanian forces have tried to put it out, they have been unable to do so due to the destruction of the water pipes. Street fighting has occurred in the western and southwestern suburbs and has not stopped. Until the 2nd of this month, several Soviet warships attempted to bombard the Allied positions but were repelled by the German coastal artillery and air force. In short, this fortress has been completely destroyed by artillery fire. If it is to be repaired, it will take at least several weeks to complete the work.

Havas Agency, Rome, 3rd Dispatch: The German army's capture of the world-famous Sevastopol fortress using super-giant cannons is a major achievement in the history of modern warfare. A correspondent for the "Corriere della Sera" in Berlin reported that it was necessary for the German army to use new-style cannons to attack defenses that were even stronger than the Maginot Line. The Gorky-style and Lenin-style armored bunkers were massive structures, and the cannons installed inside had a caliber of over 200,000 millimeters and were protected by special underground chambers made of 36 yards of steel-reinforced concrete. The German army used various giant cannons that were over six feet long to attack and destroy these defenses. At this time, the fortified area of the harbor was a scene of broken walls and ruins, like a scene after a tornado or earthquake. Pondering the battlefield is heartbreaking.

### Eleven. Sketches of Yemen (1)

Travelers from Asia to Europe, after their ships sail through the Gulf of Aden, often see a stretch of land far to the east in the narrow, hot Red Sea. That is Yemen. But most people pay little attention to this small country, and some may not have even heard of the name!

Yemen is located in the southwest of the Arabian Peninsula, facing Africa across the Bab-el-Mandeb Strait. It is bordered by Hadramaut to the east. It covers an area of ​​approximately 190,000 square kilometers and has a total population of approximately two to three million. This small country is the only wealthy area in the Arabian Peninsula. The climate here is not only warmer, but also has abundant rainfall. Grains and tropical plants are abundant, so it is no wonder that everyone likens it to "the Paradise of Arabia."

The entire territory of Yemen is mostly mountainous, averaging more than 2,000 meters above sea level. The plains near the Red Sea in the west are drier and sandier. The east and central regions are more fertile, producing spices and coffee. Other products include dates, indigo, tobacco, and fruits. In terms of minerals, there are gems, salt, and agate, and the reserves are abundant. Industry is not developed, but the manufacture of cotton fabrics, leather, and porcelain is pretty good, and is generally popular among the residents of southern Arabia.

Yemen's main product is coffee. On the way to Sana'a, on a plateau 1,450 meters above sea level, you will see lush coffee tree forests, especially in the Moka area, where they grow everywhere. Now, people who pay attention to coffee like to use Moka coffee. Its taste is so unique that the world has long recognized it.

In Saudi Arabia, you rarely see rain. As soon as you step into the territory of Yemen, you immediately feel cool. There are two rainy seasons here every year, one in mid-March, mostly affected by the Mediterranean Sea, and the second from July to September. It is not uncommon for rainfall in the mountainous areas to reach one meter. Due to the similarity in terrain, Yemen is closely linked to Abyssinia in everything. Their cities are also built at the foot of the mountains, and they are extremely similar in terms of national temperament and lifestyle.

The distribution of plants varies with the difference in altitude. Generally, low-lying areas have more Mimosa and plums, which are low shrubs. The higher you go, the more prosperous fruits and barley become. In the mountains, one or two small villages appear from time to time. The houses here are made of stone and are extremely strong, a bit like fortresses. Perhaps this area is full of bandits, so the pedestrians carry a bit of vigilance, always placing their fists on their waists. Their sleeves are tall and their appearance is similar to that of Arabs, and they like to wear dark blue clothes.

Yemen was also a territory of Turkey in the past, and it was not until the end of the last European war that it became a sheikhdom. Because its defense force is weak, it is always shaky and uncertain. Saudi Arabia in the north is eyeing it covetously. It was extremely fortunate that it was not poisoned a few years ago. It is not easy to maintain like this.

The current political center of Yemen is Sana'a, more than 2,000 meters above sea level, with a population of 30,000. Commerce is developed and it is one of the largest metropolises in Yemen.

### Shanghai Municipal Council Health Department Answers Drinking Water Questions: Tap Water After Leaving the Factory Is Sufficient to Contaminate; the Use of Sand Filters Must Be Extremely Cautious

The Shanghai Municipal Council Information Office announced that the Council’s Health Department has recently received numerous letters from the outside requesting an explanation as to whether it is necessary to boil or sand filter water for drinking purposes in Shanghai. The specific instructions are as follows: It is impossible to answer this question with a simple "yes" or "no", but it can be stated that the tap water supplied by the Shanghai Waterworks Company is tested by the Health Department every month. Each test result is considered to maintain a high degree of cleanliness. Therefore, there is no doubt that the tap water is clean when it leaves the factory. However, during the process of conveying the water, the main water pipes and accessory water pipes often pass through water seepage and poisonous pollutants, which inevitably cause contamination. If the tap is unclean, it can also transmit pollution. This type of tap pollution is not necessarily caused by germs or microorganisms. Many residents of this port have been drinking water directly from the tap for many years without any harm, but this is a risky practice.

Boiled Water Eradicates All Germs

The problem of disease transmission is extremely complex and technical, and cannot be discussed in this article. However, it can be asserted that most diseases caused by drinking water are due to pathogens contaminating the tap or storage containers such as bottles and kettles. The danger transmitted by the tap can be eliminated by boiling the water or passing it through a sand filter. Boiling is better, because once the water is boiled, all waterborne germs can be eradicated. If the boiled water is poured into a clean bottle or other container, properly isolated from dust or insects, and poured into a clean glass for consumption, there is nothing to worry about.

The Use of Sand Filters Must Be Cautious

Sand filters contain a substance that prevents water from filtering out pathogens and microorganisms, but the danger lies in the fact that the sand filter must be checked regularly. This means that the candle-shaped core, which is an important part of the device, should be removed from the shaft, scrubbed with a soft brush to remove silt, and boiled every week. This procedure is inevitably neglected, especially when it is left to the hands of servants. As a result, sand filters often lose their effectiveness within a considerable period of time. The more silt that accumulates, the more microorganisms grow. Not only is the sand filter useless, but it can even create a direct source of infection. In addition, invisible gaps in the sand filter and careless handling can easily produce the same results. Therefore, those who want to use a sand filter must be extremely cautious.

In summary, drinking water directly from the tap is usually not dangerous. Those who use sand filters must keep them clean at all times in order to be effective. As for boiling, it is the best method.

### British Evacuation Ship Will Leave Shanghai Shortly

The Shanghai Times reports that an official from the Japanese Consulate in Shanghai told reporters yesterday that the British evacuation ship will leave Shanghai shortly for Lourenço Marques. The number of British evacuees has been determined, but it is not yet known which ship they will take. The spokesperson said that if the authorities want to use one ship to carry all the British evacuees, a larger N.Y.K. ship will be requisitioned. Before leaving Shanghai, the British civilians and officials who arrived in Shanghai from Southeast Asia will be housed at the Columbia Country Club in the city. The exact evacuation procedures have not yet been ascertained, but it is believed that they will be similar to the American evacuation. It is also understood that the British in Japan and Manchuria will depart one or two days before the British evacuees in Shanghai, and then meet with the Shanghai evacuation ship in Vietnam and travel together to Lourenço Marques. According to the original evacuation procedures, British and American civilians were to be evacuated at the same time, but due to some technical obstacles, the American civilians have been evacuated first.

### Citibank Makes Fourth Withdrawal; HSBC, Chase, and Other Banks Also Prepare for Another Withdrawal

The Shanghai Times reports that Citibank's Shanghai branch began its fourth withdrawal for depositors yesterday (the 3rd). Over 400 people went to make withdrawals. It is said that this withdrawal will continue indefinitely. It is reported that the total amount of the fourth withdrawal is half of the remaining amount in the deposit accounts after the first, second, and third withdrawals, which is half of the remaining amount frozen in Citibank depositor accounts. To date, the total amount of money withdrawn by depositors has exceeded 90% of the balance on December 6th of last year. Furthermore, other banks in the city managed by the Japanese military are now making final preparations to follow Citibank's example and process another withdrawal. HSBC manager Mr. Hansjmann told reporters that HSBC is now issuing cash withdrawals of 500 yuan to depositors this week, up from 250 yuan previously. Mr. Hansjmann did not explain why, only saying that most banks are now doing the same. HSBC currently has sufficient cash on hand, so it will soon begin another withdrawal, but it has not yet received an order to do so from the supervisor. Chase Bank manager Mr. Hillman said yesterday that the Chase Bank supervisor also intends to carry out another withdrawal, but he could not say when he would receive the order.

### Yesterday's Heatwave Hits Shanghai, Temperature Rises to 92.8 Degrees

Yesterday, the city was hit by a heatwave, the whole city was like boiling, as if in an oven. It has been checked that since the beginning of summer this year, the weather has been quite cool, with temperatures hovering around 80 degrees. Summer rain has been plentiful, and residents of the city have been saying that there is no summer this year. Unexpectedly, since the day before yesterday, the weather suddenly turned scorching hot. According to the records of the Observatory, the highest temperature yesterday rose to 89.1 degrees Fahrenheit (31.7 degrees Celsius). Yesterday, the scorching sun was blazing, the whole city was like boiling, the highest temperature rose to 92.8 degrees (34 degrees Celsius), which is the first scorching hot day since the beginning of summer this year. The health effects caused by the heatwave are significant. According to Shanghai Epidemic Hospital on Yuchia Road, the number of outpatients yesterday surged to more than 400, and heatstroke patients also began to be discovered, causing the hospital's doctors to be busy with diagnosis all day long. In addition, the cold drink businesses in front of the door were booming in a short period of time, and when it came to the evening scenery of the streets and alleys, people were sitting in the cool.

### Two Concessions Decide to Sell Rice as Scheduled; Rice Transported May Not Exceed Three Dou

The Information Office of the Public Works Department announced that the last day for taxpayers in the two concessions to apply for rice tickets was the 4th of this month. In total, 90% of the taxpayers in the Public Concession have already received rice tickets, and the number in the French Concession is even higher. Therefore, the distribution of rice tickets is going smoothly, which can be said to be beyond expectations.

From Monday, the 6th of this month, to Saturday, the 11th, rice shops will only sell rice with the first coupon of the rice purchase certificate. Each coupon sells one and a half liters of white rice and half a liter of broken rice, with a total price of five yuan. Citizens do not need to squeeze into rice shops to buy rice, because the authorities guarantee that on any day within one week ending on the 11th of this month, they can buy rice from the rice shop with the number marked on the rice ticket. In addition, each household does not need to send everyone to the rice shop, only one person needs to hold the rice tickets for the whole family to purchase the corresponding amount. Because rice shops only sell rice based on the rice tickets submitted by the purchaser, regardless of the number of rice tickets. However, it should be noted that the amount of rice that can be transported without a permit in the two concessions may not exceed three dou.

Based on the above, there should be no more queuing for rice after the 6th of this month. Those who are willing to create this kind of queuing situation will hardly win our sympathy.

### Shanghai West Nightclubs Request Extension of Business Hours

According to the Shanghai Times, nightclubs in the Western District have been greatly affected by the restriction of closing at 11 pm every night. Therefore, they applied in May to extend the closing time, but have not received a reply. Recently, there is another suggestion to request the competent authorities to allow one or two nightclubs to operate overnight, while raising prices, and using part of the profits for charity. However, the suggestion has not been formally submitted. A spokesman for the Western District Police said yesterday (the 3rd) in response to reporters' questions that nightclubs must close at 11 pm at night, otherwise they will not be allowed to operate. However, according to reporters' confirmation, most nightclubs in the district are now operating until dawn.

### Various Guangdong Associations in Shanghai to End Repatriation Meeting

In view of the fact that many fellow villagers in Shanghai have lost their jobs due to the impact of the current situation, and the refugee camps have been closed, various Guangdong associations in Shanghai responded to the call for returning to their hometowns this spring. Therefore, a committee for repatriating fellow villagers to their hometowns was established. Since its official establishment in early March, it has started to implement the evacuation work. Up to now, batches of fellow villagers have been sent back to various places in Guangdong, Guangdong and other places to engage in production, totaling 600 people. There are also more than 400 people waiting to be sent. The association expected that the number of repatriations would only reach half. Recently, due to the food shortage in Guangdong Province, which is implementing the evacuation of the population, it has repeatedly received telegrams to suspend the handling. The association believed that the number of people registered to return to their hometowns was large, so on the 18th of last month, it sent a fast mail to the Guangdong Provincial Government for instructions. Yesterday, it received a reply telegram, which briefly stated, "The letter of June 18 has been received, and 191 fellow villagers waiting to be sent back to Guangdong can be sent back first. The rest will be reviewed and handled after the completion of the city's immigrant return work." Therefore, the association has decided to stop registration from tomorrow in order to comply with the law. Once the fourth and fifth batches are sent out this month, it will be announced to end.

### Shanghai's Industrial Situation Last Month

Last month, the situation of the industrial sector in the city was not significantly different from that in May.

Worker Clinic

Fifteen factories, employing 1,400 workers, have jointly established an industrial cooperative clinic, which is scheduled to open on July 1. The equipment and expenses are voluntarily donated by workers at 3 yuan per person, and 1 yuan 5 jiao per month per person, paid in advance for three months. The clinic is the second one seen this year, employing one doctor and one nurse each. Their task is to provide workers with medical materials and assist the factory in carrying out work under the protection of workers' health conditions. The clinic has an executive committee, chaired by the manager of one of the cooperative factories. The aforementioned plan was formulated by the manager and guided by the staff of the Industrial Needle Association. Before March, six large coal ball factories in the city jointly established a worker clinic, and the first phase of the trial run lasted for three months, which has now expired and achieved good results. The second phase of the trial run has already begun. Last month, a large yarn factory hired qualified doctors and nurses through the introduction of the Industrial and Social Affairs Department to take care of workers' health. The factory authorities understood the relationship between food nutrition and workers' health, so they appointed relevant personnel to be responsible for the food of the staff.

Labor Disputes

Last month, the Industrial and Social Affairs Department mediated a total of 10 industrial disputes, of which, the remaining 9 were trying to prevent strikes. The causes of the disputes included 4 cases of dismissal, 4 cases of wages, and 1 case each of suspension of business and treatment.

In addition, there were 3 cases of soliciting tips, one of which was sentenced to 15 days of detention, and the other was sentenced to 3 months of imprisonment. A total of 806 petitions regarding rent disputes were received, of which about 40% complained about excessive rent collection, and about 22% complained about eviction. Last month, two meetings were held with various groups and fellow villagers' associations to discuss the disposal of abandoned children. Two technical training schools for young workers ended the first semester in June. The autumn class is scheduled to enroll 210 new students, and plans to set up a class in electrical engineering, enrolling 80 new first-year students.

### Hua Xingruo is Good at Treating Typhoid Fever

In the article "A Method of Treating Typhoid Fever by a Traditional Chinese Medicine Doctor" published in this newspaper on the 24th of last month, the author, Mr. Hua Xingruo, was mistakenly written as Hua Xingruo. We hereby apologize. According to Hua, his original籍 is Wuxi, and he studied at a high school in Jiangsu Province. In the 24th year of the Republic of China, he began to study traditional Chinese medicine at Mr. Wu Zishen's place.

### A Grand View of Banknotes

— Qin Meng

Banknotes are paper money, which is also money. Saying this may be a bit wrong, because when banknotes lose power, they will eventually be worthless, or even become waste paper. At the end of the First European War, there was the fact that 600,000 marks could not be exchanged for a quarter of a pound of bread, but these are ultimately exceptions. Its color is so dazzling, and the printing is so exquisite, I won't mention this. The most fascinating thing is its invincible and indestructible power. Since the history of banknotes, it has dominated people's entire lives, making you comfortable, making you noble, and can be used to buy love, buy reputation, no, it can simply buy life! For example, the iron lung man in Ohio, USA, would he have survived if his father hadn't had a few more banknotes?

In this day and age, it is not easy to earn money, and the expenses are huge. Banknotes in the pocket have a precarious momentum. Therefore, except for those who engage in speculative business or the rich, salary workers are probably short-lived with banknotes, which is really unavoidable to sigh in unison!

It is said that quenching thirst by thinking of plums, then the exhibition of banknotes of past dynasties held by the YMCA is worth seeing. There, more than 4,000 kinds of banknotes have been collected, and three rooms are filled with displays. If you go on a pilgrimage once, although you will not be as bewildered as the beggar in the drama who picks up gold, but seeing all the colorful banknotes around you, as if you are in a pile of banknotes, you will have a fluttering feeling!

The venue is in the Xue Geng Hall on the second floor of the YMCA. When the reporter entered, he happened to meet the president, Mr. Guan Jiangmin. Mr. Jiang himself said: His ancestral home is Suzhou, and his family has been engaged in the money business for generations. In his father's hands, for interest and business convenience, he began to collect them. First, he started from the horizontal aspect, counting the currencies issued by government offices and banks in various provinces and regions of the current era, and collected about 2,000 kinds. Passed down to Jiang Minjun, in addition to supplementing his father's achievements at any time, he also collected them from the longitudinal aspect. From the Republic of China to the Tang, Song, Yuan, Ming, and Qing Dynasties, there are no less than 1,000 kinds, and the spirit of the two generations has become a grand view. Before the exhibition, he was worried that all the exhibits were invaluable treasures, and he asked the insurance company to insure them, but a group of companies refused to accept this novel accident insurance. He had no choice, so he photographed some of the most precious items, such as the Great Tang Treasure Banknote and the Great Song Treasure Banknote, and displayed them in films, and hid the originals. Naturally, this discounted the interest of the visitors.

There are 4,000 kinds of exhibits, all equipped with mirror frames, with descriptions, including name, age, distance from the present, and notes. Here, we will introduce a few of the most valuable and interesting ones as follows.

No. 485, Great Ming Dihang Treasure Banknote, cotton paper, white background ink printing, 8 inches high and 4 inches wide, was issued by Emperor Taizu of Ming when he was building the capital in Nanjing. In addition to simple patterns, it is printed with the words "Worth Qian Guan, Unobstructed Circulation, Those Who Forge Shall Be Executed". It is said that it was obtained from a certain ancient temple on Qingliang Mountain in Nanjing. It is an ancient relic from 600 years ago. The authenticity displayed at the venue is the oldest of all. And the oldest banknote is the Great Tang Treasure Banknote of the Tang Dynasty.

The Chinese National Treasure is about the size of the current 10-yuan legal tender paper, but the printing is very rough. One side is light green, with the words "Ten Great Yuan of Chinese Gold Coins". The front center is the Blue Sky and White Sun national flag, but the party flag is reversed, and on both sides of the national flag are the signatures of Sun Wen, the Premier of the Chinese Revolutionary Party, and Li Gongxia, the accountant of the Chinese Revolutionary Army Fundraising Bureau. This was the earliest currency established in the Republic of China. After it was printed, it was discontinued for some reason, so it is rare and very precious.

No. 701, Guangdong Official Money Bureau Yuan Banknote of the 30th Year of Guangxu, the front is purple, printed with the image of Guangxu and double dragons, and the printing is very exquisite. What is strange is that the back is printed with a notice: "First-Rank Top Dai, Imperial Permission to Ride a Horse in the Forbidden City, Wearing a Yellow Horse Jacket, Cen, the Acting Governor of Guangdong and Guangxi, is here to inform...". I guess this Cen who was specially honored was Cen Chunxuan.

No. 705, two kinds of Mongolian banknotes, both the front and back are in Mongolian, with light yellow and light green patterns, which are very similar to the embroidery patterns of cross-stitch cloth. People who don't know it will never recognize it as banknotes. No. 656, the copper yuan three-string banknote issued by the Workers' and Peasants' Bank of the Sichuan-Shaanxi Soviet Government, the material is not paper but cloth, which is unique. It is about the size of a postcard, printed with futurist patterns and the words "Proletarians of the World Unite", issued in 1933.

No. 700, the ten-yuan note issued by the Chinese Farmers' Bank in the 27th year, chestnut shell color. The banknotes of the Farmers' Bank are widely circulated, but this kind has never been seen in the market. I don't know why. What is even more strange is that most banknotes are horizontal in recent times, but this note is unique in its vertical shape.

No. 598, National Revolutionary Army 21st Army Receipt and Payment Guarantee Certificate, the nature is unknown, I don't know if it is a military ticket or something. There are five types in total, with denominations of one yuan, five yuan, ten yuan, and one hundred yuan. The area is slightly the size of an airmail stamp. Coincidentally, the copper yuan one-wen note issued by the Zhejiang Local Bank, except for the poor paper and printing, is the same size as the former, but the value is a ratio of 1 to 30,000. Don't you think it's funny?

In addition, it should be mentioned that there are many price coupons that were once popular in Shanghai in recent years, with no less than hundreds of kinds displayed here. From the four major companies on Nanjing Road to the vegetable stalls and tiger stoves, they all issued them. The highest denomination is one yuan, and the lowest is fen. The shapes and colors are varied, which is quite interesting to see. Among them, there are many with exquisite printing and sophisticated paper, such as the two-jiao price coupon of the Yiyuan Dog Racing Ground, which is printed in three colors, more than three inches wide and one inch high, making people mistaken for a Christmas card. The most perfunctory is the ×× Pancake Shop in a certain district's small vegetable market. His five-fen price coupon is actually a cigarette card stamped with a blue-indigo seal. This should be the lowest-cost currency in ancient and modern times, both at home and abroad.

After leaving the venue and passing through the corridor of the YMCA, I glanced at the motto sign and saw it written, "Freedom! Freedom! How many sins in the world exist in your name! - Madame Roland -" I couldn't help but sigh and chant: Banknotes! Banknotes! How many sins in the world are carried out in your name! (The End)

### Preparations for Summer Relief

— Yi

Summer has already arrived, inevitably bringing to mind the issue of seeking relief from the heat. However, our intention is not to leisurely advocate enjoyment, disregarding the current difficult times. Rather, the long, hot days offer numerous opportunities to accomplish much, ensuring that this summer is not spent in vain.

For example, children are now on vacation, staying at home. If left unsupervised, they will either neglect their studies or wreak havoc outdoors. Why not take this opportunity to teach them a few books, so that by the end of the summer, you can witness their excellent achievements and feel comforted!

Furthermore, the health exercises published in this magazine can be practiced as a group by the entire family. Parents and children doing a fun exercise together will undoubtedly break the monotony.

There is no end to good deeds that can be done. For instance, children can be taught to save their snack money each day and contribute to the newspaper's scholarship fund. This will not only cultivate the virtue of saving in children but also greatly benefit impoverished scholars.

Regardless of the matter, perseverance is paramount. This long summer can serve as a test of one's perseverance. We can prepare to read a book, learn a skill, engage in beneficial recreation, or plan necessary business or household matters, striving to proceed diligently during this period. This will not only allow us to happily pass the sweltering heat but also avoid wasting time.

### Between Husband and Wife

— Huan

It is impossible for people to fully understand each other and get along perfectly, and this is also true of husband and wife. However, to maintain the relationship between two people, one cannot directly notify the other of their faults. The best approach is for both to strive to restrain themselves, avoiding causing dissatisfaction to the other. The following points are what a virtuous wife or husband should endeavor to achieve:

Husband's Perspective

Do not reprimand or criticize your wife in front of the children, so as not to diminish her dignity as a mother.

Do not say to your wife: "Look at Mrs. X, she is truly a good wife!"

Do not unilaterally control the selection of movies or other such things.

When you are dissatisfied with your wife's attire, do not say so to her face. Instead, buy her an outfit that you think is suitable and give it to her as a gift. She will surely accept it with joy.

Wife's Perspective

Do not discuss household expenses or lunch preparations with him every morning.

Do not say to the children: "I'm going to tell your father!" Because men generally do not want to be the most fearsome person in the family.

When he goes out and does not tell you where he is going, do not interrogate him.

When your husband is not at home, do not mess up the documents on his desk.

As for other points, they remain for each individual to experience and discover.

### A Study of Infant Crying

— Zhu Ying

Whether in traditional or modern families, people often indiscriminately use breastfeeding to stop infants from crying, which is a serious mistake. There are many reasons why infants cry. Since infants cannot speak, they use crying to express their needs or pain. If mothers do not investigate the cause of an infant's crying but simply use breastfeeding to stop the crying, it is not only unhygienic but may also lead to the infant developing a habit of excessive crying. Because their requests are easily granted, they develop extravagant desires, leading to incessant crying day and night, which mothers find unbearable.

Therefore, I believe that new mothers, in general, should study and differentiate the reasons for an infant's crying. If the infant is crying because of illness or hunger, then the mother should take appropriate measures to alleviate the pain or breastfeed. Otherwise, if it is intentional crying or ordinary crying, it is perfectly acceptable to let the infant cry freely. Infants often use crying to coerce their mothers when they are being willful. If allowed to cry freely, they will eventually realize that it is ineffective, and the instances of willful crying may decrease. As for ordinary crying, infants often do it because they have few opportunities for exercise, so they must rely on a certain amount of crying to exercise their lungs and help circulate blood to their limbs. In this regard, mothers can observe whether the infant is healthy, whether the diaper is wet, whether the bedding in the cradle is smooth and even, whether there are mosquitoes or fleas biting, and whether the limbs are warm. If there are no abnormalities, then it is fine to let the infant cry. If the crying persists for too long, then the infant should be held and comforted to calm them down.

Now, I will describe the common states of infant crying in four categories below for mothers to study.

(A) Crying due to Pain or Illness: When an infant is suffering from an illness or is weak, the crying will be very faint and prolonged, accompanied by moaning. If it is a headache or earache, the infant may also raise their hand to scratch their head or pull at their ear. If it is an abdominal pain or crying due to mosquito or flea bites, then the crying will be very sharp and rapid, with occasional pauses, and the infant may also frown and curl up their legs.

(B) Crying due to Hunger: The crying of infants due to hunger usually occurs after feeding or before the next feeding. Crying after feeding is because they did not eat as much as they wanted, while crying before feeding is purely due to hunger. The crying is generally prolonged and accompanied by restlessness, and there may also be gestures of opening the mouth or sucking fingers.

(C) Crying due to Willfulness: When an infant is crying willfully, the tone is strong and loud, and there is also the phenomenon of stiffening the torso or kicking the legs wildly. It is easy to distinguish by the attitude. Mothers can first try to comfort and hold the infant. If the crying does not stop, then it is fine to let it go. If you give the infant what it wants or use breast milk to stop the crying, then it will inevitably lead to the development of bad crying habits in the infant, which must be paid attention to.

(D) Normal Crying: This is so-called healthy crying, with a high-pitched and robust tone. The infant sometimes stops crying and shows a slight smile, and then cries again after smiling. Infants like to do this type of crying often. All crying that is not due to pain, hunger, willfulness, fright, or discomfort from clothing or sleep falls into this category.

In addition, crying that occurs due to separation anxiety, sleeping for too long, being frightened, or suddenly seeing strangers is very easy to distinguish, so I will not elaborate.

### Malaria and Anopheles Mosquitoes

In this summer with many mosquitoes, and it seems there are especially many this year, we are very afraid of contracting malaria because we know that malaria is transmitted by mosquitoes.

The scientist who proved the origin of malaria was the famous scientist Laveran. He won the Nobel Prize for this discovery. People who suffer from malaria experience chills and fever, and their blood contains malaria parasites. Anopheles mosquitoes easily breed in places with ponds, so the chance of contracting malaria is lower in cities than in rural areas. To fundamentally eliminate anopheles mosquitoes, ponds must be eliminated.

Anopheles mosquitoes often appear at dusk. After biting a sick person and then biting a healthy person, the latter will contract malaria. Mild malaria can be cured by taking quinine, while severe cases require injections of Piasmochin. To avoid the danger of malaria, eliminating mosquitoes is naturally the most urgent task.

Here is a picture to show the difference between common mosquitoes and anopheles mosquitoes.

The picture above shows the posture of an anopheles mosquito while sucking blood. The mosquito on the right is an anopheles mosquito. The mosquito on the left is a common mosquito.

### Infant Hygiene in Summer

— Man Yun

During the summer, parents should pay special attention to the hygiene of their babies, because there are many aspects of infant care that require their attention during the summer.

If your child has reached the weaning period, but it happens to be summer, it is not advisable to wean them, because changing foods after weaning is not suitable. If you give fresh milk or milk powder, you must pay attention to its freshness. It is better to prepare a small amount, rather than preparing too much, leaving leftovers that can easily spoil. Cleanliness of food and drink is the primary condition for health.

Infants are sensitive to heat, so they should wear less clothing, but besides this, do not use fans to cool them down. Mothers should remain calm and patient in caring for their babies during the summer and avoid making them cry excessively, as excessive crying can easily cause prickly heat.

When sleeping at night, it is best to let infants sleep alone. If this is not possible, then you should try to separate your body from the infant as much as possible, so that the infant can stay cool and sleep easily.

Bathing is a necessary daily activity. The water used for bathing should not be too hot or too cold, and the bathing time should not be too long.

### The Attitude Toward Reading

— Xiao Tong

Reading is for oneself, so one must rely on one's own efforts.

Studying is not about reading aloud, but about whether the knowledge enters one's mind.

Ask teachers and classmates questions often, and think more for oneself to read well.

In class, one should "sit upright, be silent, and concentrate."

Don't be casual or only half understand, to avoid the pain of staring blankly during exams.

Reviewing lessons requires proper time management.

In addition to reading textbooks, also take notes, consult dictionaries, flip through maps, and read beneficial extracurricular reference books.

### A Message to Swimmers

— Li

Summer is a season for swimming. The YMCA swimming pool is now open. However, to protect your health, you should pay attention to the following points:

Do not enter the water to swim when you are extremely hot or extremely cold, or if you are feeling tired or within one and a half hours after eating.

Do not remain in the water for more than ten minutes continuously, and after exiting the water, do not leave wet swimwear on your body, even in sunlight.

It is safer to walk from the shallow end to the deep end and then swim back.

### Who is the Shortest One?

At first glance, the children in the picture above will certainly think that the policeman in the front is the tallest and the child rolling the hoop in the back is the shortest. In reality, the opposite is true. If you don't believe it, please measure it.

In the previous issue of this magazine, we said that the eyes cannot be trusted when viewing objects, and this is another proof.

### Health Exercise Method (II)

The most important thing in practicing health exercises is "perseverance," and the most taboo is "sporadic effort" or "leaping ahead" and "rapid progress." Consistent effort is essential to achieving success. If you rush to succeed without considering whether your physical strength is up to the task and simply engage in excessive exercise, it is difficult to achieve the desired results. Readers who are determined to strengthen their bodies should pay special attention to this point when practicing. In the explanation of the first diagram published in the previous issue, wasn't there a sentence saying "take deep breaths"? The so-called deep breathing generally refers to the rapid inhalation of air. In fact, the most important thing before inhaling is to exhale completely, because people's lungs often contain residual, unclean air, so it should be completely expelled first. After the lungs contract, then inhale, allowing fresh air to reach the tips of the lungs.

Short and rapid breaths only use part of the lungs, while deep breaths can fill the entire lung capacity. Therefore, deep breathing is very important for lung development and human health.

When taking deep breaths, it should be noted that the shoulders should not be shrugged, the chest should be expanded forward, and the body must be natural and uninhibited. It must be done slowly and naturally.

Posture

(Figure 4) Lie flat on your back, extend your hands over your head, clasp your hands together, extend your right hand and left foot, so that your fingers and toes meet, and your legs must be straight, as shown in the picture. Return to the original position, extend your left hand and right foot. Alternate each type six times. When returning to the original position, do not touch the ground with your hands and heels. Count each return to the original state as one repetition. Practice should start slowly and gradually increase in speed. The increase in speed can be determined according to each individual's situation.

(Figure 5) Lie flat on your back, with your head, arms, and hips fully touching the ground. Extend both legs and arms upwards. First, lower your right leg while raising your left arm over your head. Then alternate with your left leg and right arm. Do not touch the ground with your hands and heels when practicing. Do a total of six repetitions. Count each lowering of the left leg as one repetition. This exercise has special benefits for the liver, stomach, and intestines.

(Figure 6) Lie flat on your back, extend your arms over your head, raise both legs together, as shown in the picture, lower your arms to your waist, both arms and legs must be straight. When returning to the original position, do not touch the ground. Do a total of six repetitions. Count each return to the original position as one repetition. Lying flat on your back allows the muscles and organs of the whole body to be in the proper position, making it easier to obtain the maximum effect during exercise. This posture not only strengthens the abdominal muscles but also strengthens the back.

### A Week's Homemade Menu

— Ms. Hua Ying

The price of vegetables is generally around one dollar per catty. Anything within one dollar can be considered relatively cheap. Cucumbers have been available for more than a month, so they can no longer be considered seasonal produce and cannot be sold for a good price. They still cost seven or eight jiao per catty, which is naturally cheap. There are many ways to prepare cucumbers. For a meat dish, you can peel them, cut them into sections, stuff them with minced pork, and then braise them with cloud ear fungus and daylily. Alternatively, you can slice them and stir-fry them with seasonal shrimp or shred them and stir-fry them with pork shreds. For a vegetarian dish, you can prepare them like the stuffed cucumber with meat, just omit the minced pork and use more side ingredients. As for sweet and sour cucumber slices and pickled cucumber cubes with soy sauce or sweet sauce, they are refreshing and delicious, making them excellent accompaniments to porridge.

Monday: Cucumber Stuffed Meat Patties, Braised Fresh Carp, Stir-fried Shredded Dried Tofu with Green Peppers, Raw Gynura procumbens
