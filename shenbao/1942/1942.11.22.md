### The Battle for the Port of Bizerte: Decisive Battle Imminent, Germany Reinforces via Air and Sea, Allied Forces Pursue Encirclement Strategy

Lisbon, 21st (Allied News Agency) – According to news from Algiers, the British commander in Algeria announced that British forces have entered the Oasis of Hamma, located 25 miles southeast of Tunisia. Both Germany and Italy are maintaining silence regarding the development of the Tunisian war, making the situation unclear. However, the Axis forces in the area possess the newest weapons, never before used in any battlefield. Germany is apparently continuing to reinforce Bizerte by air and sea, with tanks and troops gradually landing to defend this major military port. A major decisive battle is inevitable. The latest report from the Allied forces stated that the British First Army, led by General Anderson, has advanced from the eastern coast of Tunisia towards Hamma. The army now stretches from 30 miles southeast of Tunis to 30 miles west of Bizerte. The British view is that General Anderson aims to trap the German forces along the Bizerte and Tunis coasts. The American forces, heavily bombed by German aircraft, have entered Fériana and Gafsa from the south via two routes: the former via railway to Sfax, and the latter via railway to Sfax. These troops intend to break through to the eastern coast of Tunisia.

Tangier, 21st (Haitong News Agency) – News about the North African situation from the Allied side in Tunisia is very scarce. Both sides are clearly setting up their positions. The current fighting consists only of small skirmishes between the Allied vanguard and Axis forces. According to American sources, the Allied forces have advanced to a mountain village 50 kilometers from Bizerte. Large Axis forces have also arrived in Tunis and Bizerte, so a major battle is expected. The Allies rely on a large number of bombers, including many Flying Fortresses. When discussing the air war over Tunisia and Algeria, the Allied side believes that their air superiority is due to the Flying Fortresses. The Allies believe that the capture of Bizerte will not be difficult. Colonel Elliot Roosevelt, son of President Roosevelt, is also serving in the American forces in North Africa. Algiers remains the Allied supply center on the North African coast.

Fierce Fighting on the Tunisian Border

Rome, 21st (Haitong News Agency) – The Italian military headquarters announced this afternoon that the Axis forces engaged and defeated enemy forces on the Algerian-Tunisian border. The enemy lost a number of tanks and motorcycles. Axis air forces attacked port facilities and ships in French North Africa. One medium-sized ship was sunk, and several large ships were heavily damaged. Ten enemy aircraft were destroyed on the ground. One of our aircraft did not return to base.

Rome, 21st (Haitong News Agency) – Official Italian announcement confirms that Axis and Allied forces have clashed on the Algerian-Tunisian border. The Axis forces initially gained the upper hand.

Lisbon, 20th (Central News Agency) – According to Vichy Radio, the Allied forces invading Tunisia have engaged in fierce fighting with Axis forces near Tabarka, a coastal stronghold 20 kilometers east of the Algerian-Tunisian border.

Total Martial Law in Morocco

Tangier, 21st (Haitong News Agency) – Reports from Casablanca state that French Morocco has declared total martial law. General Eisenhower, commander of the American forces, has requested full mobilization of French North Africa, as confirmed by news from Rabat. General Patton solemnly stated the need for strict control of food and the implementation of a more precise rationing system. After officials and gendarmes in Algiers fled to other places during the surrender of the French forces in North Africa, their families were detained by the American authorities as hostages.

### Wang's Award to Wuhan Police Officers

Hankou, 21st (Central News Agency) – Chairman Wang of the National Government came to Wuhan this time to solicit public opinion and inspect the political situation. He inspected the local police officers and found them well-organized. Furthermore, they had been diligent in their duties day and night during the recent days of heightened alert. To show his concern and encouragement, he has specially granted 15,000 stored currency, sending it to the municipal government. It is reported that the police bureau will collect it in the coming days and distribute it to the police officers throughout the city.

### Laval's Broadcast Address

Vichy, 21st (Haitong News Agency) – French government leader Laval delivered a radio address last night. He began by reviewing the current situation in France, then appealed to the French people not to be deceived by foreign propaganda. Britain and America hope for the assistance of the French people and their efforts for British and American interests. After Japan occupied the raw material supply areas of Britain and America, they attempted to find compensation in French colonies. Although Britain and America claim that they will return French territory in the future, history has taught France the opposite lesson. If France loses its colonies, it will no longer be France. Roosevelt's attack on North Africa and the liberation of Jews and communists there has revealed who is behind Britain and America. Laval continued, stating that in April of this year, he asked U.S. Ambassador to France Admiral Leahy to convey to President Roosevelt that France was determined not to disrupt U.S.-French relations, but Roosevelt has been trying to bring about the collapse of France. If Germany and France are at odds, there will be no peace in Europe. No country in Europe can survive peacefully without cooperating with Germany. French policy cannot be decided by Jews and fugitives. The French people should strive to realize national revolution, revitalize national spirit, and remove the shackles of communists and Jews. If Germany is defeated, then France and other countries in Europe will be ruled by Bolsheviks, and the old culture will be completely destroyed. Laval continued, stating that he is constantly trying to cooperate with Germany and Italy. The day will come when the French flag will once again fly over Algeria. Europe cannot continue to exist without France.

Vichy, 21st (Haitong News Agency) – Admiral Darlan stated in a radio address yesterday that he accepted the aid of the United States and the Allied forces based on the past instructions of Marshal Pétain. After the entirety of France was occupied, Marshal Pétain lost his freedom, but he is still a revered figure by the French people. Marshal Pétain's policy was to prevent the Axis forces from occupying French North Africa, which greatly benefited the Allied forces.

### Former South African Prime Minister Hertzog Dies

### Japanese Naval Correspondents Report on the Progress of Naval Battles

Tokyo, 21st (Domei News Agency) – According to a cable from Japanese naval correspondents from a certain base, the report covers the three and a half months from the First Battle of the Solomon Islands to the Battle of the South Pacific and the Third Battle of the Solomon Islands. The offensive and defensive battles fought by the Japanese and American navies in the South Pacific waters centered on the Solomon Islands can truly be called a duel between the Japanese and American navies for the key to victory in the Greater East Asia War. The American navy, with its elite fleet and Marine Corps, fiercely attacked the Japanese army, making a desperate gamble. The Japanese naval fleet and air force also used clever tactics to sink or destroy five enemy battleships, eight aircraft carriers, cruisers, destroyers, submarines, and seventy-seven various other vessels, as well as twenty-three transport ships, achieving great results. In terms of quality, the air operations between the Japanese and American navies during these three and a half months were a magnificent struggle for supremacy unmatched by the European war. In terms of quantity, it can be called a large-scale air annihilation battle since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War. Therefore, this offensive and defensive battle cannot be equated with ordinary naval battles. The American military also admits that the victory or defeat of this battle is related to the survival of the United States. The Japanese air force shot down or destroyed 850 enemy aircraft in this battle, effectively driving the enemy to collapse. The correspondents lived with the Japanese air force at a certain base and learned about the course of this offensive and defensive battle from cadre officers as follows. On August 7 of this year, the first day of the First Battle of the Solomon Islands, the Japanese army shot down a total of 58 enemy aircraft, achieving great results on that day. The valuable experience gained from attacking enemy Grumman fighters was particularly beneficial to subsequent operations. The performance of the Grumman fighter is superior to all American land-based aircraft, and the pilots are the most experienced in the American navy. Their piloting and shooting skills are good, and their fighting spirit is strong. At the beginning of the war, the Japanese army had the upper hand. Enemy aircraft attacked from an altitude of 9,000 meters. Their air base was on Guadalcanal Island, so the Japanese army had to carry out long-distance transoceanic attacks on the island. From this, the difficulty of the operation can be seen. The climate in the Solomon Islands is often characterized by the dense clouds and rainstorms unique to the South Sea. The Japanese army overcame these natural obstacles, working tirelessly day and night. After enemy aircraft were shot down or destroyed by the Japanese army, they were reinforced and restored to their original numbers within a few days. The Japanese air force adopted the tactics of forming joint formations of fighters and bombers, or only fighter squadrons, to break into the battle. The enemy also used frontal attacks and surprise attacks to exploit the gaps in the Japanese army's defense, deliberately luring the Japanese army into a chase to fall into their trap. In this kind of fierce and skillful battle, the Japanese army also suffered considerable losses. From the end of September to October, the Japanese air force, with the cooperation of the naval forces, repeatedly achieved great results. After discovering an enemy mobile force on October 25, the next day Japanese naval aircraft achieved a great victory in the sea north of the Santa Cruz Islands.

### Heavy Rain on North African Front Slows British Advance, Montgomery Reorganizes Troops, Cairo Announces Capture of Benghazi

Lisbon, 21st (Allied News Agency) – The British General Headquarters in Cairo announced today that British forces have captured Benghazi. Berlin has announced that the Axis forces have withdrawn from Benghazi according to plan after destroying military facilities and roads leading to Benghazi. Cairo also announced that the British vanguard has made contact with the Axis forces at Agedabia.

Rome, 21st (Haitong News Agency) – The Italian military headquarters announced this afternoon that our vanguard troops in Cyrenaica are highly active. Our fighter aircraft squadrons strafed enemy tank formations in the desert with machine guns, and many caught fire. The Axis forces have withdrawn from Benghazi. This is the third time the city has been occupied by enemy forces since the start of the war. Before withdrawing, our forces destroyed all military facilities.

Berlin, 21st (Haitong News Agency) – German officials stated that the British Eighth Army is advancing towards Sirte via El Merj and Msus, intending to cut off the rear lines of communication of the German and Italian armored forces. This attempt has now completely failed. German aircraft heavily attacked these British units on the 18th, inflicting heavy damage. Continuous heavy rains caused many British vehicles to become mired in the mud, making it easier for German aircraft to bomb them. Many British tanks and vehicles were destroyed. General Montgomery was forced to reorganize them. Due to the slow British advance, only small skirmishes occurred between British outposts and German and Italian rear guards along the coast until Thursday. Mines were heavily laid along the coastal roads, causing severe damage, making it difficult for the British to advance. North of Benghazi, German rear guard units attacked British forces, inflicting heavy damage before withdrawing from the port of Benghazi at night and rejoining the main Axis forces. A squadron of British warships northeast of Derna was attacked by aircraft, sinking one light cruiser and damaging one destroyer. The next day, Italian aircraft sank and heavily damaged one destroyer each.

Stockholm, 21st (Haitong News Agency) – London reports that Major Hibbert wrote in the "Daily Mail" that the Axis forces in Cyrenaica are now avoiding contact with British forces. If the British forces cannot establish bases near the front line, the difficulty of their supply will increase. The Axis forces have withdrawn from the curved area between Benghazi, Buna, and Mechili, so the British forces can only encircle a very small number of troops.

### American Ship Damaged

Lisbon, 20th (Central News Agency) – Washington reports that the U.S. Navy Department has announced that the U.S. cruiser USS Boise (10,000 tons) was damaged by the Japanese navy during the Solomon Islands battle and was sailing to a certain port on the Pacific coast for repairs on the 19th.

### Italian Coastal Air Defense Forces Ordered to Operational Status, Rumors of a Second Front Opening in the Balkans, Turkish Prime Minister Says They Will Not Hesitate to Prepare for Any Eventuality

Rome, 20th (Havas) – General Galbiati, Chief of Staff of the Italian Blackshirts (i.e., the Fascist Party Army), issued an order today stating that he has been ordered by Prime Minister Mussolini to put the coastal air defense forces into operational status. He also stated, "The enemy has had the intention of killing our country for seven years. Today, they are attacking our people's homes, churches, schools, and hospitals with ferocious force. We must retaliate a hundredfold for this act of aggression."

Tokyo, 21st (Central News Agency) – According to the Asahi Shimbun citing Sofia, all news from the Balkan countries suggests that Britain and the United States' future plans will be in the Balkans. In the past, Britain and the United States have claimed that the attacking areas will be Marseilles or Italy, but in reality, they want to confuse people. It is expected that their real goal is to form a second front between the Balkans and Turkey. Former British Prime Minister Churchill once mentioned a second front in the Balkans. Furthermore, the British General Staff revealed its future intentions during the Battle of Crete, stating that even if the British army temporarily withdrew from Crete, the British army had detailed knowledge of the terrain of Crete, and the British military attache in Turkey revealed at a British General Staff intelligence conference earlier this month that the United Kingdom had plans to open a second front in that area because of its relationship with Turkey. In connection with this, military experts in the Balkan countries predict that the center of the future operational plans of Britain and the United States will be in the Balkans. The result of the British and American forces invading French North Africa is that German troops have advanced into the entirety of France and advanced into the Tunisia area. The attention of the German troops is focused on the western Mediterranean, so it is expected that they will take advantage of this opportunity to launch an offensive in the Balkans.

Istanbul, 20th (Havas) – According to a broadcast by Ankara Radio today, Turkish Prime Minister Saraçoğlu, in view of the changes in the North African situation and the crisis from the Mediterranean that threatens Turkey, reiterated that Turkey will not hesitate to prepare for any eventuality, regardless of all difficulties.

Madrid, 21st (Central News Agency) – After the Spanish government announced the mobilization of a portion of the national army on the 17th to defend its neutral policy against foreign invasion, the Spanish army began a large-scale exercise in the Valencia region on the Mediterranean coast, lasting three days. Elite troops from the army, navy, and air force all participated, directly commanded by the General Staff. The main objective was to simulate an enemy landing operation. A spokesman for the Spanish military authorities said on the 20th that the exercise was a great success.

Stockholm, 21st (Haitong News Agency) – London reports that the British Admiralty has announced that the Mediterranean Sea, except for the territorial waters of Spain and Turkey, is a "dangerous area for navigation."

### Large-Scale Battles on the Central and Northern Sectors of the Eastern Front, Soviet Engineering Teams Concentrate in the Caucasus, Preparing to Construct Strong New Defense Lines

Fuehrer Headquarters, 21st (Haitong News Agency) – This afternoon's German military report stated that enemy forces launched numerous attacks in the Terek region, all of which retreated with heavy losses. From October 25 to November 19, our forces captured 18,000 enemy soldiers, and the enemy destroyed 189 tanks, 283 artillery pieces, and 630 infantry heavy weapons. Enemy forces south of Stalingrad and in the Kalmuk highlands launched attacks with elite troops and Zuk vehicles. Enemy mechanized units were annihilated. The German and Allied forces continued to fight bravely in the lower Don region. A regiment of Soviet cavalry that broke into our positions has been annihilated.

Berlin, 21st (Haitong News Agency) – Military sources here declared last night that there were large-scale battles on the central and northern sectors of the Eastern Front yesterday. German and Allied forces are conducting defensive battles, repeatedly winning victories. The fierce fighting on the southern sector of the Eastern Front is still ongoing. The fierce fighting in the Don region mentioned in yesterday's German military report has been confirmed. The fighting has intensified on all fronts.

Berlin, 21st (Havas) – According to news from the Turkish capital, the Red Army has been concentrating engineering teams on the southern sector of the Caucasus front for several days to construct strong fortifications. The Red Army seems to want to establish a new line of defense there in preparation for the continued advance of the German forces.

### Commander of the British Western Defense Forces Changes

Bern, 20th (Havas) – According to news from London, the British government has appointed Sir Horton as the commander of the British Western Defense Forces, stationed in Liverpool, succeeding Sir Naper. Sir Naper will be filling the seat of British naval representative in America left by Admiral Creagh-Hanover who was transferred to be the British naval commander in North Africa.

Africa in a Changing World

### Storm Clouds Gathering Over French West Africa (1)

The Troubled State of France

Since the Anglo-American Allied forces launched a lightning offensive in French North Africa, not only has the entire Mediterranean situation been transformed, but it can even be said that the whole world has been affected. The drastic changes in the overall situation in Africa were, of course, to be expected.

First, regarding the European continent, in order to prevent further attacks by the Allied powers on the French mainland coast, Germany and Italy, without waiting for the consent of the Vichy government, suddenly sent troops into the French Free Zone on the 11th of this month—the anniversary of the end of the last European war—and quickly occupied the entire French coast. From a strategic standpoint, this is naturally a necessary precaution taken to prevent trouble before it happens. However, considering the defeated France, it is like suffering two blows within a few days, not only losing vast overseas territories, but also forfeiting the temporary peace of the Free Zone. From then on, it will undoubtedly fall deeper into the abyss with no way to escape.

However, the actual impact of the North African campaign is not limited to just France. If Britain and America can control the North African coast in the future, their strength in the Mediterranean will naturally be enhanced. Therefore, it is most conceivable that they will use the North African coast as a base to launch further offensives against any point in southern Europe. The weakest link among these, as feared by Führer Hitler, is the southern coast of France. Therefore, the entry of German and Italian troops for defense, from the perspective of operational needs, can be considered a "good move." However, looking at the entire southern coast of Europe, although some places are stronger than France in terms of defense, it cannot be said that they are absolutely impregnable. Places like Spain, Greece, and even certain parts of Italy itself, will German troops be sent to garrison them in the future? This is a noteworthy question.

At the same time, the actions of Britain and America in North Africa are clearly a clever way to implement what they call "opening a second battlefield." This method is certainly easier than directly landing in Europe. However, it is not without its use in diverting Germany's strength on the Eastern Front, so it is not difficult to imagine that the Soviet Union will indirectly receive some help. In addition, once North Africa falls, the battles on the Egyptian and Libyan borders will inevitably be greatly affected. These are the initial benefits that Britain and America can gain from the North African campaign. The only problem is that they seem to be too cruel to their former French allies! As for whether Britain and America can further achieve greater results after seizing North Africa, the first thing to consider is how the Axis powers will counterattack, and the second is to wait and see how all parties react to the North African events. For example, the allegiance of other French territories in Africa is also a factor to be taken seriously in the future. According to the news reports of the past few days, the important ports of Algeria and Morocco seem to have been occupied by Britain and America, but Tunisia is still in the hands of the Axis powers. In addition, whether French West Africa, the largest French territory in Africa, is prepared to obey Vichy's orders and resist foreign invasion in the future remains to be seen. In any case, one thing can be asserted: the defeated France, whether its mainland or its overseas territories, will inevitably be successively at the mercy of others. This is the greatest tragedy of this world war, and it is the most unbearable humiliation for the 86-year-old Marshal Pétain. Sympathizers around the world can only hope that he can get rid of this pain as soon as possible.

A Full View of French West Africa

As mentioned above, French West Africa is France's largest territory, with a total area of more than 1.8 million square miles, equal to nine times that of its mainland. The entire territory includes seven colonies, with the port of Dakar as the soul of the entire West Africa.

Considering the intention of Britain and America in advancing into North Africa, assisting the Soviet Union is indeed one of the main motives, but viewed from the perspective of the overall war plan, it is another step after the Battle of Madagascar to attempt to control the entire Africa. Taking West Africa as an example, Dakar, where the Governor-General of French West Africa is located, is not only a good French naval port with many warships stationed there, but also a necessary route for British and American shipping. British and American merchant fleets sailing from the Atlantic Ocean to the Indian Ocean must pass through the port of Dakar. If it is controlled by the enemy, the British and American shipping routes will be severely hit. Moreover, there is a risk that the Axis powers may use the port as a base for submarines, so it is imperative to seize it. The bombardment of the port by the British fleet in September 1940, in an attempt to land, is a clear indication of the port's importance. Although North Africa has now fallen, West Africa does not seem to have submitted yet, so it is generally believed that Dakar may become North Africa's second at any time.

Now, let's briefly introduce the full picture of French West Africa as follows:

### Japanese Military Administration of Company Bonds: Face Values All Converted to New Currency, Stamped at a 2-to-1 Ratio; Bondholders Should Apply Within the Deadline

Therefore, various old currency bonds issued by military-administered companies should also be converted at this ratio and new currency bonds issued. However, the Japanese military has temporarily decided to use the method of reducing the new currency amount on the old bonds, stamping them, and temporarily using them as new currency bonds. Holders of old bonds are requested to apply for stamping in accordance with the format specified by the Shanghai Embassy Affairs Office, starting from December 1st, within two months for those residing in various parts of Central China, and within three months for those residing in other areas, to the issuing company.

### Shanghai Municipal Council Warns Citizens Against Blindly Investing in Stocks

The Shanghai Municipal Council's Information Office announced: It has been found recently that some unscrupulous merchants have established fly-by-night companies, fabricating news on one hand and promoting their stocks based on meaningless appeals. Some companies whose business losses are already well-known are still promoting stocks in the market. Although the company's financial situation is poor, due to some people engaging in manipulation, the stock price has risen by 25% to 30% within a week. In addition, the stocks of some new companies, whose value and future are unreliable, are also being promoted in the market based on false advertising. In view of this, the Council, in order to protect the interests of citizens, hereby issues a warning to those who take advantage of the situation in the Concession to seek windfall profits. Investors, for their own benefit, should carefully examine the company's balance sheet, profit and loss statement, and business report before investing in stocks. Those truly reliable and financially sound companies are happy to disclose the company's true situation; on the contrary, general false organizations that specialize in seeking windfall profits will never want to disclose their true internal affairs to the outside world. Anyone who believes that they have been deceived by a certain company, for the sake of public interest, should report to the nearest police station for investigation. Issued by the Shanghai Municipal Council Information Office, November 1st.

### Slaughtering Cat and Dog Meat, Passing It Off as Pork for Profit: Three Offenders Sentenced to Imprisonment

As the saying goes, "hanging a sheep's head and selling dog meat" is used to describe a person's deceitfulness. Unexpectedly, such a fact has actually been discovered. Due to the slightly scarce sources of pork in the city and manipulation by others, the market price has repeatedly hit the black market, and it is still difficult to buy. Therefore, some people are selling other meats mixed in. Gu Wenyao, a Chinese detective from the Jiaxing Road Police Station, learned that someone at No. 199, Wuzhou Road, Lane No Number, was catching a large number of cats and dogs, slaughtering them, and then selling them as beef and mutton. He went to arrest them at 11:30 am the day before. At that time, he arrested Jiang Guoliang from Jiangbei, Yu Xiaolaohan, and Cao Xisheng from Pudong. He seized two live dogs and countless slaughtered dog and cat meat. It was found that Jiang was in charge of the slaughtering work, Yu was responsible for catching cats and dogs, and Cao was responsible for selling them. They were all taken into custody. Yesterday, they were sent to the Shanghai Municipal Council and prosecuted for fraud and other crimes. After trial, Jiang and the other two were each sentenced to four months in prison as a warning.

Now that it is winter, these procedures have been cancelled from the 18th of this month. However, in order to prevent the spread of smallpox, smallpox vaccination is required from today. All steamer companies have notified passengers that they must have a citizen's certificate, a return home certificate, or a pass to purchase tickets.

### National Medicine Public Hospital Seeks Donations

The National Medicine Public Hospital has been in operation for two and a half years, purely for charitable relief purposes. It provides medical consultations and medicine, and has 120 free hospital beds. However, the hospital has no funds and relies on donations from all sectors of society to maintain its operations. The medical services are managed by Dr. Ding Zhongying, who has hired Dr. Zhang Jin'ou to preside over them. As there are many outpatients and inpatients, the monthly expenses for medicine, food, rice, etc., require 30,000 yuan. Currently, donations are very small, and there is no news of assistance from the Poor and Sick Relief Association, so it is still hoped that society will provide assistance. The office is located in the Renji Charity Hall on Yunfu Road.

### Grade A Football Match Grand Occasion Unprecedented; Donghua Defeated St. Francis Yesterday; First Victory Resulted in Five to Three; Donghua Led Three to Two in the First Half

In the second act of the Western Union Football Grade A League, Donghua made its debut yesterday against St. Francis at Jiaozhou Park. Donghua won its first victory, defeating them with a score of five to three. Donghua led by five to three in the first half. Donghua showed its colors in the league for the first time. In addition, Xu Wenkui had just come from Hong Kong to participate, so the audience was huge. Jiaozhou Park was packed. There were more than 10,000 people, and the grand occasion was comparable to the Baojia and Self-Defense Corps matches.

You Liang's Performance Was Superb

Donghua's performance yesterday was most superb with Jia Youliang, which was breathtaking. His several diagonal hook shots and passes were wonderfully unmatched. Each time he charged, the opponent's formation was shaken. A Dai still maintained his original appearance, cooperating with Jia. It was a pity that the penalty kick was missed. A Kui had only been in Shanghai for two weeks after arriving from Hong Kong and did not kick with much energy in his first appearance. Han Longhai ran all over the field and was very hardworking, but others were just average. The defenders lost the ball repeatedly, which was very worrying for Donghua yesterday. If the team had Yuan Kuntian, it would be even stronger. The St. Francis team was a combination of Beixi and Tong and consisted entirely of young people. They were lively and scared and should be one of the strong teams this season.

The Course of the Battle Was Tense and Exciting

The battle was tense throughout. Just five minutes after contact, W. Pantunson of the Carrolie District received a pass and shot it into the left goal. St. Francis scored first. A quarter of an hour later, Wen Kui passed the ball to Cao Qinfang. Cao picked it up, A Dai passed it to an opening, and Youliang rushed up and hit it hard, resulting in a goal, making it one to one. Twenty-five minutes later, Zhao Peng lost his footing, Longhai came late, and Carrolie District scored again, two to one. St. Francis took the lead again. Forty minutes later, Guangzhong sent a long pass. The ball was intercepted by Ivanov. A Dai rushed up, Ivanov wanted to avoid it but couldn't, and the ball landed and was kicked in by Dai, two to two, a second tie. In the last minute of the first half, Wen Kui received a throw-in from Youliang and sent it to the left. Qinfang headed it down, A Dai pressed it and broke through the St. Francis goal again, three to two. Donghua took the lead. In the second half, Donghua took advantage of the victory and the momentum was strong. Greenberg was penalized for charging in the penalty area. A Dai took the penalty kick, but it hit the crossbar and bounced back. Before long, Zhao Peng kicked a free kick straight into the goal area. A Dai hooked back, Youliang rushed up and shot, returning with success, four to two. Twenty-seven minutes later, Longhai was also penalized for a penalty kick. Fuen swept it in, four to three. The difference was only one goal again. St. Francis launched a full-scale attack and the offensive was very strong. Donghua's hinterland was in danger, but fortunately the defense was strong. In the last minute, Donghua got a corner kick opportunity. Youliang opened and sent it to Guangzhong, and then passed it to Wen Kui's feet. Wen Kui's strange foot lifted up and broke into the net, five to three. Donghua secured the victory. Before the game, there was another Grade C opening game, where Zilai Fire won against Shigantai by three to zero. The lineups of the Dongsheng teams are as follows:

Donghua Association

Zhang Banglun

Li Ning Zhuang Youren

Zhang Zhaopeng Han Longhai Zhou Guangzhong

### Sixty Yuan for Type C Bonds Is Enough, Why Bother?

The over-the-counter market for public bonds rebounded and rose again. This was due to the various banking groups making covering purchases. Furthermore, because it was Saturday, all parties were eager to close out positions, causing market prices to rise again. People's sentiments were normal, and there was still some hesitation, but the buying interest was stronger due to covering transactions. Thus, the trend broke through the 60-yuan mark again. Yesterday, Type C bonds initially traded at 58.50 yuan and rose as high as over 61 yuan, closing at 61 yuan. Type A bonds were at 59 yuan, Type B at 58 yuan, Type D at 55 yuan, and Type E at 57.50 yuan, all up by 1.50 to 3 yuan.

### Surge in Chinese Stocks: A New Trend in Business

Recently, the Chinese stock market has been booming, with great excitement. The ups and downs of various stocks are like the changing seasons, offering ample opportunities for speculation. Everything is available. Once a "price is quoted," it is immediately "accumulated". Those watching the board are at a loss, only seeing the chips piling up more and more. They don't know if it is a "hidden hand," or "a winning hand," or just "gambling with dice." In the end, they don't know whether to fold "or even have to look at the colors, estimate the weight." Fortunately, everyone is not taking it too seriously, just going back and forth, doing business. Before the stock is issued, the receipts are already circulating in large quantities. Profit and loss are unknown, success and failure are unclear, but the stock price immediately rises several times. This makes those who do not trade cotton yarn, gold, or foreign stocks envious, with their eyes burning with desire. As long as it is a stock receipt, it is cherished like foreign treasure. It is kept aside for three or four days. If there is any profit to be made, it can be sold off later. After calculating, using other people's paper to trade, the benefits still go to others. It is better to go out on your own, rent an office, employ a few staff, put up a sign, invite some important guests, issue some self-promotion, connect with some prominent figures, and contact some stock companies. With the sound of gongs and drums, you can also get rich. The world is full of opportunities to gain both fame and fortune, "so easily".

There are several old companies that see that the new businesses are really making money. Without delay, they "re-evaluate their old assets." Suddenly, they transform from poor people to wealthy gentlemen. They use this to repay old debts, pay off past dues, and can offer discounts on cash to collect new shares and increase capital. This is like getting three for one, increasing liabilities by only twenty-five percent, while the actual income increases by fifty to one hundred percent. This is truly a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Fortunately, there are too many opportunities to get rich through speculation and hoarding. No matter if you add three or five, they are all snapped up. You might subscribe for one hundred shares but only get ten or five. Even getting that is considered lucky.

Those who do business are exceptionally astute, "thinking of seizing cheap opportunities." Seeing where the big profits are, they will not let go easily. With a furrowed brow, a plan comes to mind. They pick up the abacus, two ones make one five, every five advances to ten. They are truly imitating Xi Shi, and are investing to become "companies of companies." If a company wants to open, increase capital, borrow money, or adjust funds, as long as you come to the door, fifty or one hundred thousand can always be transferred. However, the conditions are harsh. It's not just a few accountants, but the positions of chairman, general manager, directors, and supervisors must be shared. On the one hand, they desperately absorb deposits and call for additional shares to satisfy their desire to get rich and implement their desired "new financial clique." However, "doing it this way," they certainly emerge prominently. But what is the result? It is still unknown. (Middle)

### 20-Count Yarn Trading: In a Dilemma: Yellow and Blue Slips Have Different Prices

Since the permission to resume Shuangma yarn trading, the ready-made yarn market (Ningbo Road Tonghe Guli) has been crowded with people, becoming doubly lively. Everyone can abide by the business rules and practice spot trading of "paying a deposit and issuing a slip." The opening price for 42-count double-strand Lanfeng yarn is between 10,450 yuan and 10,500 yuan in Central Reserve Certificates per piece (all within the price limit). Due to cost considerations, most sellers are unwilling to sell 20-count Lanfeng and 20-count Shuangma yarn at the price limit (5,555 yuan). If the buyer has a real need, the price must be 6,300 to 40 yuan before a transaction can be made. Therefore, sellers are asking around 6,400 to 500 yuan (including tax) for 20-count Lanfeng and 20-count Shuangma (yellow slip). Both buyers and sellers are in a dilemma. Furthermore, the market differentiates between yellow and blue slips for 20-count Shuangma yarn. The so-called yellow slip is the Zhejiang Xingye Bank warehouse slip, which is light yellow in color. As for the blue slip, it is the Shanghai Bank First Warehouse slip, which is light blue in color. However, some people believe that the yarn from the yellow slip is better and should be priced higher. In fact, they are both produced by Shenxin No. 9 Factory and are of the same quality. Why differentiate between high and low? Is it because of the newness of the goods? Only those in the industry know this. (Dragon)

### Sharp Increase in Wool Fabric Business

The wool fabric market has seen significant progress recently. Due to the cold weather and actual sales, the business of the door shops and men's and women's clothing stores has increased sharply. Users have a considerable appetite for medium-thick, dark-colored wool fabrics and various overcoat fabrics needed for the cold weather. On the other hand, the hoarding of spring and summer wool fabrics is also active. The popular goods are more lively than the suit goods, and prices are rising across the board. The most dominant suit linings are Yinfeng 1470 French lining, Gongping Taijitu floral calico, Chengfeng mercerized feather yarn, and Meitai black carbon lining. Yesterday, Chengfeng mercerized feather yarn was 9.50 yuan per yard for the first grade and 8.25 yuan for the second grade. Taijitu floral calico was 11 yuan, 1470 French lining was 5.80 yuan, Lixing pilisi was 130 yuan, Rongkang white straight tribute was 290 yuan, and Yihe raw-color riding breeches was 250 yuan, with grass green at 270 yuan.

### Supply of Coarse Grains Gradually Improving

The source of coarse grains has slightly improved, so the supply is getting better and the trading is active. However, the market is still firm. There are 50 packages of Pudong broad beans, priced at 274 yuan, 30 packages of Chongming Xinsha yellow, priced at 256 yuan, 70 packages of sand silkworms, priced at 200 yuan to 205 yuan, 20 packages of sand red, priced at 257 yuan, 30 packages of Jiading white silkworms, priced at 232 yuan, one cart of Mingguang aged red grain, priced at 175 yuan, and one cart of Feizi soybean cake, to be delivered in seven to ten days, priced at 70 yuan.

### Prices of Black Dates and Golden Vegetables Fall

According to a Nanjing dispatch, the price of black dates has also slightly decreased. For example, North Township date kings are 600 yuan, Bazhuang are 470 yuan, South Township date tops are 500 yuan, the next grade is 480 yuan, Gaozhuang are 440 yuan, second-grade dates are 400 yuan, the next grade is 380 yuan, about one-tenth less than before. The marked prices are still difficult to match.

According to a letter from the production area, the price of golden vegetables has not changed much, but the stock is gradually thinning. However, with the recent easing of exchange rates, the matched price is slightly more favorable, so the market here is also more accommodating, with ups and downs of dozens of marks compared to the highest price. For example, the top-grade vegetables are currently selling for 700 yuan, with successive reductions for lower grades.

### Sugar Merchants Settle Accounts, Military Scrip is Firm, Gold and Silver Prices Remain Stable

Yesterday, the gold shop industry in this city, Dashin, continued to list the selling price of jewelry gold at 2,750 yuan per tael in stores (buying back at about 300 yuan less). The industry still has no formal market price to open, with prices reportedly rising from 2,550 yuan to over 2,600 yuan, a gain of 50 yuan. The listed price of jewelry fine silver remained at 14 yuan per tael, with the industry buying and selling at 13 yuan and 13.4 yuan.

Yesterday, the foreign currency market saw the Japanese military scrip firm. The market price for silver and small private banks was 5.55 yuan for buying and over 6 yuan for selling.

Xinghe Qianzhuang in this city joined the Qianye Reserve Bank as a member on the 23rd of this month and has already notified the Silver Zhunhui.

### Vigorous Search for Cigarettes, Daily Necessities Rebound and Soar

In the daily necessities market, due to reports of reduced inventory, those holding the goods are hoarding them. The price of candles is soaring, and other items such as soap and matches are also trending upward again. Phoenix brand is 2,600 yuan, Meili brand is 2,700 yuan, Jinding brand is 2,250 yuan, and miscellaneous brands are 2,000 yuan, up 50 yuan from before. Guben soap is 400 yuan, Baixiangmao soap is 360 yuan, Huangxiangmao soap is 305 yuan, and Scissor soap is 370 yuan, a sudden increase of ten to twenty yuan. Bailei's ship candles are 300 yuan, Monk Hat brand is 250 yuan, and miscellaneous brands are 200 yuan, the most dramatic increase.

The cigarette market is showing firmness. Various parties are taking advantage of the low prices to frequently search for them, resulting in prices that are stable with a tendency to firm. British brands are 8,900 yuan, Old Knife brand is 8,850 yuan, Pinhai hard pack is 7,900 yuan, Fairy brand is 6,950 yuan, Wuhua brand is 6,600 yuan, Japanese tobacco Jinguang brand is 3,100 yuan, Jinda Lou is 3,400 yuan, Red Rose is 2,750 yuan, Quanlv brand is 3,250 yuan, 20 cigarettes are 3,150 yuan, Double Axe brand is 3,650 yuan, and national tobacco Pyramid is 6,400 yuan, Meili brand is 5,600 yuan, and Golden Mouse brand is 3,900 yuan, showing a mutually firm trend.
