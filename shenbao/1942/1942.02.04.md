### Japanese Reinforcements in Southern Malaya: Intense Artillery Battles Across the Strait; British Forces Resolve to Defend Singapore

Tokyo, 3rd, Domei News Agency: Intense heavy artillery duels raged yesterday between British and Japanese forces on both sides of the Johor Strait. Japanese troops have reportedly reached the southernmost tip of the Malay Peninsula, appearing impatient upon witnessing the destroyed remnants of the Johor Strait causeway. According to a spokesperson for the Army Press Department at General Headquarters, the Japanese army intends to "capture Singapore in one fell swoop." Approximately 14,000 British troops are stationed on Singapore Island, with defense works believed to be complete.

Saigon, 3rd, Domei News Agency: A Reuter's dispatch citing British sources states that British leaders in Singapore are confident in the ability of British forces to defend Singapore for an extended period. British Headquarters has decided to abandon naval and air bases in the northern part of the island, which are vulnerable to Japanese artillery fire, and rely on southern coastal batteries to withstand Japanese artillery and air attacks. British authorities also hope that by implementing rationing of water and food, the residents of Singapore Island will be able to safely endure the defense period.

London, 3rd, Reuter's: Can Singapore hold out long enough for Allied forces to strengthen their position in the Pacific? This is a topic of current discussion in London. The British believe that Singapore is impregnable to naval attacks from the east, west, and south, but highly vulnerable through the "back door" of the Johor Strait. British strategy is to hold out as long as possible, allowing Allied forces to concentrate sufficient troops, while ensuring that supply lines to Singapore remain open. The Japanese side, keenly aware of the disadvantages of prolonged delays, will exert every effort to seize islands around Singapore, isolating it and then launching airborne attacks using paratroopers. However, authorities here generally believe that such an operation would entail extreme sacrifice and be difficult to succeed.

Singapore, 3rd, Reuter's: A British Far East Command communiqué issued this afternoon stated that in the past 24 hours, Japanese aircraft have been very active over Singapore, conducting high-altitude bombing and dive-bombing, causing fires in several locations. There has been no activity by Japanese ground forces against our defenses.

Singapore, 3rd, Havas: Japanese planes bombed the city twice this morning, with 35 planes in the first wave and 27 in the second.

Malaya West Coast, 2nd, Domei News Agency: With the fall of Johor Bahru, the 55-day campaign has come to an end. Japanese troops, after enduring sweltering heat and engaging in lightning warfare through dense jungles, are now getting their first respite near Johor Bahru.

Singapore, 2nd, Havas: Reuter's has just released news that although the defending forces of Singapore have made a firm resolve to fight to the last man, and despite adequate supplies of food and water, the difficult situation in Singapore remains undeniable. Regarding the water supply problem, the pipes carrying water from the reservoirs of the Malay Peninsula to Singapore Island were destroyed along with the Johor Causeway. Fortunately, the island's reservoirs have recently been expanded, and continuous heavy rains have fallen. If a strict rationing system is implemented, the people should not suffer from a shortage of water. Secondly, food reserves are substantial, sufficient to meet the needs of the people. However, the military situation is not entirely satisfactory. The world-renowned Singapore Naval Base, located on the northern shore of the island, is vulnerable to bombardment from Japanese artillery positions on the Johor hills, and therefore cannot be used. The island's three air bases are also prime targets for Japanese bombing and will have to be abandoned. Furthermore, due to a lack of ground support, the British air force does not have air superiority, which will further enhance Japan's ability to attack this fortress. Another difficult problem is the handling of civilian casualties during air raids, and the continued functioning of the administrative machinery. These issues are difficult to answer at this time. Everyone knows the importance of defending Singapore, but at this point, the fortress is strategically less important because its naval base and airfields cannot be used. If a large-scale counter-offensive can be launched within days, Singapore can be preserved. Otherwise, if Singapore falls into Japanese hands, it will become a major refueling station for the Japanese army, and at the very least a base for submarines and destroyers. Furthermore, if the coast of Sumatra is controlled by the Japanese, Allied ships will not be able to navigate the Strait of Malacca, and Batavia and Palembang, which are strategically very important to the Allies, will also be threatened. Allied naval and merchant ships will then likely have to move further south, behind Java, and the Singapore fortress will be subjected to regular bombing by Japanese aircraft.

### Air Raids on Hanoi and Lang Son: Statements by Japanese Spokesperson

Domei News Agency, 3rd, Local Dispatch: Mr. Matsuda, Assistant Spokesperson for the Japanese General Army, yesterday afternoon briefed foreign journalists on the unprovoked bombing of undefended villages in northern Vietnam by Chongqing bombers on January 22nd and 24th. Reportedly, the first bombing occurred at 3:00 PM on January 22nd, when 18 Chongqing bombers, made in the United States and piloted by American pilots, entered Vietnamese airspace and dropped 50-kilogram bombs on a small village about 40 kilometers northeast of Hanoi, resulting in 6 local deaths and 25 injuries. Two days later, at 2:20 PM, Chongqing aircraft launched a second attack, dropping 50-kilogram bombs on a mountainous area 30 kilometers northwest of Lang Son, causing 10 Vietnamese deaths and 10 injuries. At that time, one American pilot parachuted out of his aircraft and surrendered to the Japanese army. Although the Lang Son authorities have lodged a strong protest with Chongqing, Chongqing has not provided a satisfactory response.

### No Change in Situation on Burma Border; Strong British Positions West of Moulmein; Part of Japanese Army Surreptitiously Crosses Salween River

Rangoon, 3rd, Reuter's: The Army authorities announced last night that there had been no changes to the situation on the Salween River front lines. There has only been intermittent artillery fire between the two sides.

Rangoon, 3rd, Reuter's: It was disclosed today that after the fall of Moulmein, the Burma Road campaign has entered a new phase. Fresh Indian troops have been deployed to strengthen the British line west of the Salween River. The Salween River is a natural barrier, with a wide river surface that makes it difficult for large Japanese forces to cross. Current activity on this line is limited to shelling across the river.

Rangoon, 3rd, Reuter's: It is reported that small groups of Japanese troops have crossed the Salween River at several locations and reached the jungle areas west of the river, but they were repelled by Allied forces.

London, 2nd, Havas: Responsible sources here made statements today, acknowledging that "If Rangoon falls, the Chinese fighting strength will be significantly affected." Ever since the Japanese advance into Burma, both China and Britain have been deeply concerned. This fact is openly acknowledged here. Although British troops have now established strong new positions west of Moulmein, the fact remains that Rangoon is only 120 miles west of Moulmein. If the Burmese capital subsequently falls, the "Burma Road" will be closed as a result. As for the situation on Singapore Island, it is believed here that since the Japanese occupied the north bank of the Johor Strait, the island fortress has in effect lost its entire effectiveness. In the future, the Japanese will likely attempt to occupy the small islands surrounding Singapore separately, thereby completely isolating this fortress. Therefore, the commander of the island's garrison has many problems to solve before reinforcements arrive. The most obvious is the large increase in refugees retreating from the Malay Peninsula, which must be properly accommodated.

### 100 American Planes Participate in Pacific War; Surabaya Encounters First Sudden Attack

Stockholm, 3rd, Haitong: Assuming American claims of losing 11 planes are accurate, it can be inferred that at least 100 American aircraft participated in this campaign. The British and American naval communities believe that America's "blitzkrieg" against Japanese bases lays the foundation for the recovery of the Philippines, Guam, and Wake Island. However, British political circles suggest that this American offensive is intended to boost morale.

Domei News Agency, Local Dispatch: A Japanese naval spokesperson yesterday denied reports from Reuter's and the Melbourne Radio that Japanese warships were damaged while attacking enemy fleets near the Marshall Islands. The spokesperson stated that reports claiming that a Japanese first-class cruiser and three other Japanese warships were severely damaged are completely groundless. The Japanese fleet is currently pursuing the enemy fleet to ascertain its strength. Further details are pending. According to a report from the Japanese fleet commander, the enemy ships made only a superficial bombardment of the Marshall Islands.

Stockholm, 3rd, Haitong: The Japanese report of a Japanese general offensive against American forces on the Bataan Peninsula has been confirmed by the Washington official gazette yesterday. It also said that the American forces fought hard and repelled the Japanese offensive.

Batavia, 3rd, Reuter's Urgent: The official announcement today stated that Surabaya, the Dutch naval base, was attacked by Japanese bombers for the first time this morning.

### US President Requests Congressional Approval for 500 Million Yuan Loan to China; Britain also Plans to Loan 50 Million Pounds

Lisbon, 2nd, Domei News Agency: According to Washington sources, Mr. Song Ziwen, the representative of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs currently in Washington, is extremely active in seeking new loans from the US government and financial circles. It is rumored that an understanding has been reached with the US side for a new loan of 500 million US dollars, and on the 2nd, President Roosevelt formally submitted the loan proposal to Congress for approval.

Washington, 2nd, Special Dispatch: President Roosevelt has requested that Congress loan China an amount totaling 500 million US dollars. The President said, "The responsible authorities of the US government and the Chinese government have both drawn my attention to the urgent need to rapidly increase economic and financial assistance to China at this time. This assistance, in both quantity and form, far exceeds the limits previously approved by Congress. I believe that continuing to increase assistance to China will be of minor help to China's domestic economy and the military efficiency of China as an ally in the common war effort. Therefore, I urge Congress to immediately pass the bill to provide aid to China. I hereby submit a draft bill for consideration by both houses to achieve the above purpose." A Congressional spokesperson announced that the bill will be examined on the 4th of this month.

Washington, 2nd, Urgent Dispatch: The White House announced that President Roosevelt has urged Congress to pass the $500 million loan to China. The President has sent a letter to Speaker of the House Rayburn, requesting Congress to approve the bill. Republican and Democratic leaders have discussed the matter with Treasury Secretary Morgenthau and Reconstruction Finance Corporation Chairman Jones. Morgenthau and Jones reportedly explained the President's request to the leaders. According to a White House statement, Congressional leaders have agreed to the President's request. Speaker Rayburn is scheduled to submit the bill to the House of Representatives today. Mr. Song Ziwen recently met with President Roosevelt and also had discussions with Morgenthau, the content of which was clearly related to the loan matter.

Lisbon, 2nd, Domei News Agency: According to dispatches from London, the British government has informed the Chongqing government that it intends to lend China an amount limited to 50 million pounds. The above loan is based on the loan agreement between China and Britain, providing China with weapons and military supplies, etc.

### Jiang Tingfu Receives Reporters to Elaborate on the International Situation: Allied Nations Have Unanimously Given Importance to the Asian Theater of War

Chongqing, 3rd: Director Jiang Tingfu of the Executive Yuan made the following remarks at a reception for foreign reporters on the 3rd:

European and Asian Theaters Equally Important

The discussion on the relative importance of the European and Asian theaters can now be brought to a close. Recently, friendly leaders such as President Roosevelt, Prime Minister Churchill, and Secretary of the Navy Knox have all expressed their utmost concern for both theaters, and have made very definite statements. Yesterday, Dr. Mook, the Vice-Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies, again published a letter to the Chinese people, whose insightful understanding and sincere friendship towards us have truly moved us greatly. From this, it can be seen that the strategy of the Allies is indeed consistent, and there are already considerable achievements in action.

British and American Loans Emphasize the Far East

Today, President Roosevelt urged Congress to lend our country 500 million US dollars, and the British government simultaneously announced a loan of 50 million pounds to China, which proves that Britain and the United States value the Far East, not only in words, but also in deeds. Recently, friendly leaders have repeatedly offered words of comfort to our country, on the one hand to express the consistency of strategy, and on the other hand perhaps fearing that our people's fighting spirit will be affected by the small setbacks of Britain and the United States in the Pacific. If so, then such concerns are truly unnecessary.

Our Fighting Spirit is Always Strong

We have been fighting for more than four years, and due to insufficient military equipment, we have often suffered setbacks, but our fighting spirit has always been strong and never wavered in the slightest. How can we today see the occasional small setbacks of our allies and affect our fighting spirit? After fighting alone for four and a half years, we are extremely excited that powerful Allied forces have joined us to fight shoulder to shoulder. Our belief is firm, believing that the phased small setbacks of Britain and the United States are by no means enough to affect the overall situation. We sincerely hope that you will convey this point to the British and American people, so that they can greatly dispel their concerns.

### US Secretary of the Navy Acknowledges the Seriousness of the Situation in Both Oceans; Naval Supplementary Budget Passed by the Senate; Shipbuilding Plan Expected to be Completed Earlier

Washington, 2nd, Havas: The Senate has just passed the 26.495 billion dollar naval supplementary appropriations bill, and it will now be sent to the House of Representatives for discussion.

Washington, 2nd, Havas: The Senate Appropriations Committee announced today that in its proposed $26.5 billion naval expenditure bill, it is requesting $944 million to cover the cost of British ships being repaired by US Navy shipyards.

Washington, 1st, Havas: The Senate Appropriations Committee discussed the government's proposed $26.5 billion naval supplementary appropriations bill today. Secretary of the Navy Knox attended and gave a speech to explain the matter, stating, "The situation in both the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans is very tense. We only have a 'One-Ocean Navy,' but we are now fighting in both oceans. We must not only protect our own coastlines, but also ensure the security of the coastlines of the Americas. Our One-Ocean Navy, in addition to protecting the American continent, must also be dispersed in the major oceans of the world. Therefore, we need time to increase our strength. We cannot expect to achieve everything in one fell swoop. In any case, the current shipbuilding plan has been revised to allow for earlier completion. One of the biggest difficulties in manufacturing military equipment is the production of aircraft engines, because the output of engines is far behind the output of fuselages and wings. Therefore, we must do our best to develop this important sector of the military equipment industry in order to accelerate production.

### Brazil and Three Other Countries Sever Diplomatic Relations with Japan

### General Göring Visits Rome: Holds Talks with Italian Prime Minister

Berlin, 2nd, Havas: It has recently been learned that Air Minister General Göring traveled to Italy on the 27th of last month. The official announcement of this news was only made today.

### Quisling Government Established; German Commissioner Holds Significant Power

Oslo, 2nd, Havas: After the establishment of the Quisling government, the original departments were upgraded to ministries, and the heads of departments were renamed ministers. The continuing ministers are: Minister of the Interior Hagelin, Minister of Agriculture Blekin, Minister of Labor Hustad, Minister of Culture and Education Stangki, Minister of Justice Riesnas, Minister of Police Jonasri, Minister of People's Culture Lunde, Minister of Social Affairs Lie Pedersen, Minister of Sports and Service Stanger, Secretary-General Fuggsang. In addition, Fritz, the former administrator of Trondelag district, was appointed as the Minister of Finance, Baeluker, the administrator of Oslo and Akergus district, as the Minister of Industry and Fisheries, Sandberg as the financial advisor, and Lyvornour as the advisor to the Ministry of Supply.

Stockholm, 2nd, Havas: A Berlin dispatch was published in the newspapers here, stating that after the establishment of the new Norwegian government, all sectors in Germany believed that Quisling was merely the leader of the government, while German Commissioner Dalpohen was the de facto head of Norway. Dalpohen is the personal representative of Führer Hitler, and Quisling's authority will gradually weaken. Norway may not be fully independent before the end of the current war. In short, since Quisling has not been appointed as the head of state, the possibility of formally appointing another head of state still exists. It is expected that Berlin may have other decisions on this matter.

### Population Census to be Completed Within the Month; Illiterate Individuals Can Have Forms Filled Out on Their Behalf

The Public Concession is conducting a population census. Over 200,000 copies of the first batch of census forms have been distributed. Police officers began collecting the second part of the census forms yesterday morning and completed the collection today. In the following two days, the second batch of census forms will be distributed and collected again two days later. This procedure will be repeated until the census is expected to be completed around February 10th. It is said that the general public's attitude towards the population census is quite satisfactory, and the progress of the census is also very smooth, as the public had been instructed in advance through newspapers and radio broadcasts to cooperate with the police. When collecting the census forms, police officers only collect the forms filled in black ink, while forms filled in red ink are to be kept properly by the residents.

Census Forms Available in Six Languages

The census forms have been printed in a total of six languages and distributed according to nationality. It has been learned that some households have experienced misunderstandings or suspicions. These households are mostly those with lower levels of education, but the misunderstandings disappear once explained. Police officers conducting the census, if wearing plain clothes, carry identification cards that can be shown immediately to dispel doubts. Additionally, for a portion of households that are illiterate or unable to write, the police officers conducting the census will ask about each item on the form one by one and fill it out on their behalf. However, this is an exception, as census personnel find it difficult to wait for long periods of time. If the current plan can be implemented without obstruction, it is hoped that all work can be completed by the end of this month. According to another source, the population census of the Public Concession may be completed around the 10th of this month.

### All Traffic Lights in the Public Concession Are Suspended

After the French Concession traffic lights were suspended last month, the Public Concession traffic lights followed suit, being suspended after 7 p.m. However, since the strict restrictions on private car traffic in both concessions, the traffic lights have lost their importance in directing traffic. Furthermore, to save electricity, all traffic lights on the main roads of the Public Concession have been suspended from yesterday.

### Number of Licensed Cars Reduced by Another 40%

Of the cars previously licensed by the Bureau to operate in Shanghai, 40% are no longer permitted to operate after the strict restriction of periodically exchanging old licenses for new ones. Their owners can no longer obtain a license. The number of licenses issued to doctors has not been reduced. The new licenses came into effect on the 1st of this month. As for those who previously obtained a license and paid the vehicle license fee, but are now unable to obtain a new license, the Bureau will allow them to recover a portion of the license fee paid, provided that these car owners return the notification. There were a total of 261 traffic accidents in the Public Concession in January, resulting in 8 deaths and 115 injuries. In the same month last year, there were 660 traffic accidents, resulting in 14 deaths and 238 injuries, showing that traffic accidents have greatly decreased after the reduction of cars in Shanghai, and the roads are much safer than before. Accidents involving public vehicles have also decreased compared to before, with only 9 cases. Accidents involving trams and trolleybuses totaled 93 cases, and accidents involving cars totaled 81 cases, compared to 568 cases in the same month last year, which is only one-eighth. Accidents involving human-powered vehicles have increased instead. Last year, the number of accidents involving these vehicles was 278, while this year it is 319.

### Tonight's West Youth Basketball Game: Lian Xing vs. Giants Final Showdown: Lian Xing Overcomes Zhong Yi Yesterday

The West Youth Basketball League has reached its final stage. At 8:15 tonight, Class A's Lian Xing and Giants will have their final showdown. The strengths of the two teams are evenly matched. The former has eight wins and one loss in eight games, while the latter has six wins and two losses in eight games. If Lian Xing can win in one fell swoop, they will win the championship. Otherwise, there will be a rematch. The Giants are known for their coordination and accurate shooting. Players such as Jian Long and Fulunike are all dangerous figures. Lian Xing has a well-rounded roster, with the eccentric Chen Xuechong and sharpshooter Kong Guangyi Qu Xilin supported by two foreign players, Tao Bolin and Ji Qiang. This is the third time the two heroes have met. It is difficult to predict who will win. Tickets are 3 yuan downstairs and 2.2 yuan upstairs. In yesterday's game, Lian Xing relied on Kong Guangyi and Zhou Yaokang to each score 15 points, defeating Zhong Yi 52-33. The first half was 22-11, with Lian Xing leading. In Class B, Storm defeated Yiguang, and Lingyou defeated Yiguang.

### Public Bonds Buying Surge after Lottery Numbers Announced

The grey market for public bonds saw a buying surge yesterday after the supplementary 12th lottery numbers for Type E were announced in the newspapers. It is assumed that all subsequent procedures will be carried out as usual in Chongqing, greatly boosting public confidence. Market prices rose by as much as 9 jiao to 1.8 yuan. All five types of public bonds were traded. The reduction in interest rates by various banks has made depositors wary, naturally leading to a surge in investment in public bonds. In addition, the procedures are being handled in Chongqing, so there should be no problems going forward. The market prospects are still bright because interest is still being paid, so prices may continue to rise. Type C opened at 67.2 yuan, up 3 jiao from the previous day, and gradually rose to 8 yuan and 1 jiao, closing at 7 yuan and 8 jiao, up 9 jiao. Type A opened at 71.7 yuan, a sharp increase of 1.5 yuan, closing at 1.6 yuan. Type B rose from 68.7 yuan to 9.2 yuan, closing at 9.1 yuan. Type D rose from 63.1 yuan to 3.8 yuan, a unique increase of 1.8 yuan because it had not been traded for two days. Type E rose from 65.5 yuan to 5.9 yuan, closing at 5.5 yuan. The market is strong and promising. Tongyiyu and Yitai were buying, while Shuntai and Runde were selling. Transactions totaled approximately 200,000 yuan. Today, the Securities Industry Association will convene a meeting of members, probably to discuss the formal opening of the market.

The rise and fall of foreign stocks were mixed. Trading in public utility stocks increased to 7,900 shares, and rubber stocks traded 1,200 shares. Paper stocks accounted for the largest share of trading at 4,000 shares, with the price falling sharply from 5.5 yuan to 2 jiao, a drop of 6 jiao. Only Kaiping rose by 1.5 yuan, from 27 yuan to 8.5 yuan.

### High Grain Prices, Oil Shortage

Due to continuous rainfall in the rice market, the arrival of goods has gradually decreased, and sales have been brisk due to the end of the year. Early and late rice and Northern Bang old and broken rice are especially tight. Early and late rice have increased sharply by 6-7 yuan, and Northern indica rice has also risen by 3-4 yuan. Qingjiao thin rice opened at 207-205 yuan, secondary at 200 yuan, early rice at 206-203 yuan, Northern Bang white broken rice opened at 235 yuan, Kunshan white japonica rice at 232-229 yuan, while glutinous rice supply and demand are balanced. Jin Tan glutinous rice traded on the rice market at 205-203 yuan, with a volume of nearly 300 bags.

Although the retail price of oil is still 3.25 yuan per jin, due to the lack of market inventory and demand exceeding supply, yesterday evening various oil shops put up signs saying "Oil is sold out, will be available again later," and many people who came to buy oil returned disappointed. The quality of retail oil on the market is even worse, and it is no longer possible to find pure raw soybean oil. Furthermore, soybean oil will run out before raw oil, and the 80% surge in the price of soy sauce starting from February 1 is alarming.

### Supply Falls Short of Demand, Gold Prices Increase Powerfully

Yesterday, the cash price increase was even more intense, exceeding the 11,000 yuan mark. There was also news that buyers would benefit, leading to a steady rise. The morning opening was 10 yuan higher, with Shunyuan Jintai Kangrun 10 liang at 10,950 yuan. Securities firms briefly sold, retreating to 930 yuan. Hengyu Lai surged forward, and a certain gold firm in the financial industry briefly sold before quickly recovering, suddenly jumping out of 1,000 yuan. Shunyuan Decheng Qianzhuang and Nanjing merchants re-entered, seeing it fly to 420 yuan. A certain jewelry store and Qianzhuang gang further raised the price, and the upward trend resumed sharply. The highest price was 11,700 yuan offered by an external customer to the gold firm for 10 liang. The final transaction price was 11,630 yuan. Afterwards, there was demand but no supply, with the price rising 690 yuan. Due to the lack of sellers, transactions were scarce everywhere. Jewelry gold was listed at 100 yuan per liang, for 1,250 yuan (reduced by 150 yuan for purchase), fine silver was listed at 14 yuan, black market at 10.5 yuan, and silver coins at 6 yuan, all with buyers, it is said.

The British and American gold pounds were still 280 yuan and 290 yuan respectively. US dollar notes rose to 16.34 yuan, Hong Kong notes also rose to 2.75 yuan, large notes to 2.65 yuan, and military notes to 3.9567 yuan.

Spring and Autumn

### "Need" and "Cheap"

— Jin Yi

Shanghai's "great discounts" have already been debunked. "Regardless of cost" and "reluctant sacrifice," the "regardless" is limited, and the "sacrifice" is not much; however, "adding marks" is very "timely." Whatever the price of U.S. dollar notes is today, a tube of toothpaste that used to cost four dimes suddenly becomes half a dollar, and hoarding goods naturally increases in value day by day. This was, of course, the situation before "August 8th."

What about after "August 8th"? At first, things were still hesitant, meaning that while people dared not "look large" anymore, things didn't plummet either. However, buying rice became more and more difficult, and thousands of people returned to their hometowns every day. The purchasing power of those who "can't leave but can't stay" is also conceivable. Now the year is coming to an end, and the New Year is approaching. Looking at those glass windows covered with red paper strips, can you still bear to say that the shopkeepers are cheating customers? Compared to the prices before "August 8th," they are at least 30% off; unfortunately, very few people are still buying cheap goods!

This is a matter of need, not a matter of being cheap.

For example, with trams, whether they used to be the car class or the rickshaw class, they are now "all coming to me." Every car is packed tightly, and every station is an exhibition of heads. In terms of supply, this phenomenon is called "demand exceeding supply"; since "demand exceeds supply," naturally, the price can be increased a bit. However, there are also "cheap" things. For example, before it was at least 18 cents, and it was often difficult to find two-cent change. The procedure was also cumbersome. As long as the ticket seller and the passenger raised their voices a little, they could immediately start scolding each other, even resorting to violence. The issue was only two cents. Who is willing to criticize who is right and who is wrong? Now, in units of five cents, a ticket is given, so there is no need to speak. You can just stamp the ticket. Since everyone doesn't speak, naturally there is no way to scold, let alone resort to violence!

### A Life of Numbers?

— Confession

Life is like a series of connected numbers, and this is especially worth pondering at this time and place.

In the long line in front of the rice shop, each person has chalk marks on their shoulders: 195, 248, 310... The white powder slowly dissipates in the cold air, becoming blurred. There are more and more people, but the numbers on their shoulders must be carefully guarded, as if their entire lives are entrusted to them.

In the bank, there is also a large, dark crowd. They take their bags to get a copper tag, on which is engraved, "Number 8 from XX Bank, invalid upon leaving." Thinking of the banknotes and looking at the number on the copper tag, everyone's heart is filled with joy, and some are anxious looking at the banknotes in other people's hands.

In the theater, noble gentlemen and ladies are led by young foreign girls. She takes the tickets and points to the row in the back, saying, "Seat Number F, 6." The man smiles and says to the woman, "Look, this seat number is the best seat in the whole theater!" Numbers are lucky here.

Other hospitals, schools, shops, alleys, cars, and bicycles are all labeled with numbers. There is also a type of number that is attached to prisoners who are not often seen. Various numbers represent various functions, show various different emotions, and bring different destinies to mankind.

Is life really a series of connected numbers?

### Drum

— Zefu

The drum song evolved from the mountain drum song, which began around the middle of the Qing Dynasty, or during the Tongzhi reign. Most drum songs are large and lengthy, requiring a long time to perform. The drum seems to compensate for this shortcoming, only taking zero segments to sing, roughly like short stories. It is said that it first became popular in Shandong, which is commonly known as pear blossom drum, and in addition to playing the strings and drums, two pieces of pear blossom bamboo slips are added for clappers. Some say that pear blossoms were originally broken pieces of copper, which were used to adjust the tone; later they were changed to the current style, which has lost its original source. At first, they were only played and sung in the streets, and the lyrics were mostly like ditties, such as Twelve Months of Ancient Names, Fisherman's Profit, and Beautiful Women. After the Guangxu reign, historical stories became popular, many of which were taken from novels such as Romance of the Three Kingdoms, Water Margin, and Dream of the Red Chamber, such as Battle of Changsha, Riot in Jiangzhou, and Daiyu's Sorrow in Autumn. In addition to the original tune, Peking opera and Bangzi tunes were later inserted into the singing, such as the "I am" section of Xipi in The Empty City Stratagem. The drum is quite popular in the north, and there are Beijing Drum, Fengtian Drum, Shandong Drum, Tianjin Drum, Leting Drum, and Hexi Drum, all named after the region. In addition, those divided by musical instruments include Pear Blossom Drum, Iron Plate Drum, and Five-Tone Drum.

Seventeen Homecoming

"I hope Lao Han's eyes are not mistaken, and that she can have a homecoming sooner and live a more comfortable life in the future." He also knew that he could no longer give his daughter any happiness. "But the safest thing to do is to let me see that boy myself first! Don't be confused and fooled by others."

However, his illness had already progressed to the point where he could not get out of bed.

"Why call someone home?" He thought about this question for four or five nights without being able to solve it. However, those tuberculosis germs, more vicious than poisonous snakes, were raging in his body more and more every day. The cough was constant day and night, and his breathing was gradually shortening. Not to mention that the doctor already knew that he could only live for ten days or half a month at most, even Mei Bao and Lao Han's family clearly saw that the "lamp of his life" was quickly going out bit by bit.

"This,... is there anything... sad about it?…The... world...people!...Who...one...! Does not die?" Because Mei Bao was crying like a fountain of tears all day long, he deliberately used extremely optimistic words to comfort her. "Die...Death is...a kind of...homecoming....Remember...Remember Shao...Wen...Seventh Master from...used to...tell...me...! No matter rich...people or...or poor people..., in the end there is...only...one...homecoming...That...that is death!"

Besides crying bitterly, Mei Bao really didn't know what else to say. (224)
