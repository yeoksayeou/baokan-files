### Fierce Fighting in the Caucasus Mountains: Germany Claims Breakthrough of Soviet Positions; Tank Battles Continue at the Entrance to Stalingrad

German Führer Headquarters, 29th, Havas News Agency: According to the German High Command, German forces in the Caucasus mountains have broken through enemy positions and annihilated the remaining enemy troops. In the Stalingrad area, German forces continue to advance. Several enemy counterattacks have been repulsed.

Berlin, 29th, Havas News Agency: The secret of the German operations in the Caucasus has been partially revealed today. Responsible sources in Berlin disclosed today that German forces and their allies have broken through multiple strong enemy positions in the most difficult part of the hundreds-of-kilometers-long Caucasus front. Although the names of the locations have not been released, it is not denied that the German victory has military significance. After the Soviet forces launched a tank counterattack in the Stalingrad area in an attempt to relieve the pressure from German forces, the German offensive on Stalingrad continued to make progress. At a certain point on the Eastern Front, German forces destroyed 19 Soviet tanks. In the fierce battles southwest of Kalach and near Rzhev, although Soviet forces assisted the offensive with a large number of fighter planes and tanks, they were ultimately defeated by German forces. 111 Soviet tanks were destroyed in that area. The Soviet offensive near Rzhev was also repulsed by intense German artillery fire.

Berlin, 29th, Havas News Agency: According to responsible German sources, German and allied forces have occupied enemy strongholds in the Caucasus mountains. Enemy forces, assisted by aircraft, launched an attack southeast of Kalach, but were repulsed. Soviet forces lost 111 tanks. The fighting is fierce in various locations on the Eastern Front. Soviet forces lost 241 tanks yesterday and the day before yesterday.

Moscow, 29th, Allied News Agency: At the entrance to Stalingrad, there is currently a major tank battle. Over 120 German mechanized units are launching concentrated attacks in an attempt to break through Soviet defenses. Large units of German hand-held machine gun troops have broken through Soviet lines in a certain location. Another unit of German machine gun troops parachuted on Thursday night near an important military industrial target. These German forces are commanded by General Bock and are currently approaching the first line of strong fortifications around Stalingrad. Soviet counterattacks are becoming stronger, more powerful, and more frequent, especially in the northern sector, where they are mostly blocked by Italian forces. In some areas, the fighting is taking place only about 20 miles from Stalingrad. The key question now is whether Soviet General Timoshenko can deploy more manpower and resources in time. There is no new information from the Kotelnikovo front southwest of Stalingrad, but it is reported that the German air force is heavily attacking Soviet reinforcements heading to the area. As for the Caucasus front, fighting is taking place in deep valleys on both sides, south of Krasnodar on the western side and in the Prokhladny district on the eastern side, requiring new strategies. German tanks and infantry are forced to march in dense columns, making them vulnerable to flank attacks and ambushes. Soviet Sturmovik bombers are bombing German columns from the air.

Moscow, 29th, Allied News Agency: The Soviet Information Bureau's midnight communiqué mentions continued fierce fighting on the Caucasus, Stalingrad, and Moscow fronts, around Rzhev. According to the communiqué, on August 28, Soviet forces engaged German forces outside Rzhev (southeast of Kleskaya), northwest of Stalingrad (northeast of Kotelnikovo), and in the Prokhladny-Mozdok and Krasnodar regions. There were no major changes in other areas of the front.

Ukrainian Border, 29th, Havas News Agency: According to neutral military experts, the resistance of Soviet forces in the Caucasus and Stalingrad areas has strengthened in the past 24 hours, but this will not have a major impact on the overall battle. German mechanized units reached the Volga River on the 25th of this month, no more than 25 miles north of Stalingrad. In the southwestern part of the city, the German offensive is intensifying and advanced, and occupied the area of ​​Tsaga on the 26th of this month. The army turned north and was about 15 miles from the Volga River yesterday. As a result, the German offensive against the semi-circular defense money in Stalingrad has become increasingly effective.

Berlin, 29th, Havas News Agency: The German High Command announced that the German Air Force continued to heavily bomb important munitions factories in Stalingrad on Thursday, several of which were destroyed by bombs. Dock facilities were hit and caught fire. The flames could be seen from 50 kilometers away. That night, German bombers caused ten fires and explosions in the southeast road from Moscow's Serpukhov airfield. Most of the hangars were destroyed.

A Certain City on the Ukrainian Border, 28th, Havas News Agency: According to German sources, fierce fighting continues in the Stalingrad area. General Timoshenko is now in a delicate position. No matter what action he takes in other areas, it is too late to relieve the pressure from German forces on the Red Army around the city. In the Kasharinsky district northwest of Stalingrad, Germany has also opened a gap in the Red Army's positions and is now expanding it. The vanguard of the German and Romanian allied forces is now only 25 miles from the center of Stalingrad. According to semi-official sources, German forces have occupied the city of Yablochkino northwest of Stalingrad. This city is also one of the Soviet Union's transportation hubs. The Kotelnikovo-Stalingrad railway intersects the Tairbeti-Elista highway in the city. As for the Caucasus region, German forces have continued to advance toward Libya in the past 24 hours. All five major mountain passes are in German hands. Afterwards, it does not appear that German forces will encounter any serious difficulties moving south of the Caucasus region. However, the Red Army is resolutely resisting along the Black Sea coast, holding firm to its positions near the port of Anapa. In addition, the German and Romanian allied forces on the Taman Peninsula continue to advance and have not encountered any resistance, indicating that the main force of the Red Army has already withdrawn. West of the city of Akhtanizovskaya, the German and Romanian allied forces reached the end of the Taman Bay this morning.

### Red Army Counteroffensive in the Central Sector Makes Progress; Berlin Officials Claim Soviet Strength Has Declined

Berlin, 29th, Havas News Agency: Officials here declared yesterday that Soviet General Chugov's offensive in the central sector of the Eastern Front has now lost the strength to break through German lines. Although Soviet forces may be able to launch local offensives, they no longer have much strength.

Ankara, 29th, Havas News Agency: News received from Moscow yesterday indicates that Soviet authorities have stated that the rescue counteroffensive launched by Soviet forces in the central sector has failed to improve the situation in the southern sector. Yesterday afternoon, the Soviet war report stated that fighting was fierce in Stalingrad and the Caucasus, and for the first time mentioned the strategically important city of Mozdok west of Grozny. Well-informed sources in Moscow pointed out that German forces in the southern sector can deploy far more troops and equipment than the Soviets. The Soviet forces have been unable to defend all points of the line and have also been unable to concentrate forces comparable to those of the German side.

Berlin, 28th, Havas News Agency: The German High Command announced that in the past two weeks, the Soviet counteroffensive in the Rzhev area has suffered heavy losses. Although there has been slight progress, it is of no real value. German forces fought decisively against numerically superior enemy forces near Rzhev and north of Leding, enduring great hardship. Although Soviet forces occupied certain villages and towns, they have no military value and have been completely destroyed by German artillery. The Red Army has suffered 10,000 casualties and thousands of tanks. On the 26th of this month, our air force shot down 16 Soviet planes and destroyed 9 of their tanks and 13 artillery pieces. At night, we bombed the railway line from Kalinin to Moscow. In addition, factories as far away as Saratov and Gorky were also bombed.

Finnish land defenses unleashed a fierce barrage of fire, dispersing most of the attacking planes. However, several planes still penetrated the barrage, reaching the city and dropping mines and incendiary bombs. Five people were killed and about twenty were injured. Several fires broke out, and several buildings were damaged.

Helsinki, 29th, Havas News Agency: Last night's Finnish war report stated that our artillery in the Karelian Isthmus shelled enemy railways and supply stations with considerable effect. There are no significant war reports to report from the Olonets Isthmus. In the southern sector of the Eastern Front, enemy forces attacked the Poventsa district, and we captured over 100 prisoners. Northwest of the Stalin Canal, enemy forces, under the cover of heavy artillery and trench mortars, attacked our positions in the darkness, but were repulsed, leaving behind many dead bodies. The enemy then launched an attack with smoke bombs, but was also unsuccessful. There were only skirmishes and artillery battles in the northern sector of Eastern Finland. One enemy transport ship on Lake Ladoga, carrying fuel to Leningrad, was hit by our torpedoes.

Berlin, 29th, Havas News Agency: The "Dainin Observation Post" field reporter Parson Dow predicted that German forces will soon launch a large-scale counteroffensive against Leningrad. The enemy's failure will be the same as what they are currently encountering in the southern sector.

### Battle of Dieppe, Northern France: Publication of German and British Losses; Berlin Announces Casualties

Berlin, 29th (Haitong News Agency) – According to a German military communiqué, the British losses during the attempted landing at Dieppe amounted to 600 killed, 2,195 captured, including Lieutenant Colonel Chattham, commander of the 6th Canadian Infantry Brigade, 13 staff officers, and 112 other officers. The loss of enemy materiel included 29 tanks and armored vehicles, a large number of light and heavy infantry weapons, and various other war equipment. Furthermore, the number of enemy troops who drowned while landing and when ships sank far exceeded the number of prisoners. Enemy corpses continue to be washed ashore by the sea. The British Air Force lost 127 aircraft in the Battle of Dieppe. German artillery and aircraft sank 4 enemy destroyers, 2 torpedo boats, 1 speedboat, 7 transport ships, and a large number of landing craft. They also severely damaged 4 British cruisers, 4 destroyers, 5 transport ships, 2 small warships, and numerous landing craft. German losses were as follows: Army: 159 killed, 187 wounded, 14 missing. Navy: 78 killed and missing, 53 wounded. Air Force (including anti-aircraft artillery units and signal corps): 104 killed and missing, 58 wounded. The total German loss was 591 men. In addition, 35 aircraft and one submarine destroyer were lost, and 6 artillery pieces were damaged. The communiqué concluded by stating that the attitude of the French people was very correct, as they were unwilling to be killed or injured assisting the German forces in combat, extinguishing fires, caring for the wounded, and providing food to the German troops. To reward this attitude, the German Führer has ordered the release of French prisoners of war from the Dieppe area.

German High Command Statement

Berlin, 29th (Haitong News Agency) – The German High Command, in order to refute the British claim that the Allied landing at Dieppe on August 19th was merely a localized raid, today issued a statement, citing facts to explain that the Allied landing attempt was, in fact, a large-scale military operation to invade the continent. The facts cited in the statement, in addition to those previously published, also include the contents of the "Operational Orders" found on the person of a captured British staff officer, which prove that the enemy landing was not merely a localized raid. According to the operational orders, the objective of the attack was the town of Arques-la-Bataille, located approximately seven kilometers inland from Dieppe. The full text of the order is 121 pages long. The British objective was to occupy two suitable French seaports closest to Paris, as a base for continued advancement. It was hoped to overcome the German defenses between the Somme and Seine rivers, and then occupy Abbeville and Le Havre. Furthermore, the operational orders detailed the selection of the most suitable locations on the beaches near Dieppe for the establishment of prisoner-of-war camps to hold German prisoners. French civilians who had reached or had not exceeded military service age and who wished to join the Free French forces could be evacuated to Britain. Furthermore, it is noteworthy that the order strictly prohibited Allied soldiers from looting on the spot, as German troops were disciplined and the French people would judge Allied soldiers by the same standard. The German High Command statement also revealed that the Allies deployed more than 100 bombers during the Dieppe landing, many of which were large, four-engine aircraft, protected by at least 1,000 fighter aircraft. Apart from the German air force stationed inland a short distance from the coast, which was deployed to assist in the battle, there was no need for reinforcements. By the afternoon of August 19th, the German commander in the Dieppe area was able to telegraph headquarters that his forces had repelled the landing forces. To prove that the London claim that the Allied withdrawal was orderly was incorrect, the German authorities released the telegraphic exchanges intercepted between the British landing force transport ships and the headquarters in Britain at the time. The text stated, "11:40 AM, the situation is critical along the entire front, staff ships are under attack." "1:21 PM, the requested reinforcements have not yet arrived." "3:10 PM, all participating units, quickly find ways to escape according to the circumstances." By 6:41 PM, the fleeing British transport ships telegraphed again, "Send aircraft assistance immediately." At 10:40 PM, another urgent telegram was sent, which only stated, "Ship sinking, send assistance quickly."

### Major General Woodworth Writes on Timing of British Offensive; Berlin Issues New Air Defense Regulations

Bern, Switzerland, 28th (Havas News Agency) – Retired U.S. Navy Major General Woodworth published an article in the Argentine newspaper "La Prensa," stating that Britain might launch an offensive in French West Africa’s Dakar, Portuguese Cape Verde Islands, Azores Islands, and Spanish Canary Islands during September and October. Since Brazil's entry into the war, the strategic position of the South Atlantic has changed. The Cape Verde Islands are the link between the South American and African coasts and should be rendered ineffective and prevent the enemy from establishing a base in the Azores Islands in the future. As for the method of landing, the ports and military facilities on the islands can be bombed first, and then troops can be landed without difficulty. German political figures commented on this article, stating only that Woodworth's arguments are sufficient to indicate Britain's intention to expand the war to neutral zones. However, because it cannot be regarded as an official statement, Germany will not take any decisions on this matter for the time being.

Bern, Switzerland, 28th (Havas News Agency) – Berlin reports that the Berlin Police Commissioner today issued new air defense regulations, stipulating that in the future, when enemy aircraft approach Berlin's airspace, if there are not many aircraft and they are unlikely to launch a serious attack, sirens will be used as a signal. In this case, only limited precautions will be implemented, and public transportation and industrial and commercial institutions can continue to operate as usual. Recently, small numbers of enemy aircraft have frequently flown over Berlin, which, while insufficient for bombing, is more than enough to disrupt the daily lives of residents. Therefore, the authorities have had to adopt the above measures.

### Suspected Cholera Cases Continue to be Discovered

According to the English-language 大美晚报 (Great American Evening News), reporters have learned that the health departments of the two concessions received a total of 19 reports of suspected cholera cases yesterday, and one person has died. Of these 19 cases, 11 were discovered in the International Settlement (one death) and 8 in the French Concession. The total number of people who received vaccinations yesterday was 6,908, of which 5,459 were in the French Concession and 1,449 in the International Settlement.

According to the English-language 泰晤士报 (Times), the number of people vaccinated in the French Concession yesterday was still low, with only 5,710 people. According to applications to the various health vaccination teams, the total number of vaccinations in the area has reached 1.4 million. According to the Health Department, the reason for the decline in the number of vaccinations is that residents of the French Concession have mostly received their second vaccinations since the second anti-epidemic campaign began in July of this year. Looking back at the vaccination campaign, it proceeded very slowly at first until the beginning of this month, when the two concessions began to achieve a result of 30,000 to 40,000 vaccinations per day, and many applications for vaccinations were also received from the public health department in the Chinese areas. In the past two weeks, the discovery of cholera cases has varied daily, with a total of 17 cases in the two concessions. On Thursday, two reports were received. All patients are Chinese, and no foreigners have been found to be infected.

### Price Control Measures Have Been Negotiated and Finalized; Will Be Promulgated in the Near Future

According to the English-language 泰晤士报 (Times), although not officially confirmed yesterday, it is widely believed that the relevant authorities have negotiated and finalized price control measures, and the agreed-upon basic rules will be promulgated in the near future. Previously, although the Nanjing and Shanghai authorities, the Shanghai Municipal Council of the International Settlement, and the French Municipal Council issued separate price control measures in early spring, no cooperative action was taken.

Price Control Scope Expanded to Other Ports

Shops that exceed the price limits are fined and suspended from business for a specified period of time. However, it is expected that this approach will also be implemented in various parts of Central China. And in order to make general shops obey orders, the penalties will be more severe. After several discussions, the implementation of individual price limit measures is expected to become a reality. The competent economic authorities in Central China have also prepared for the time when the implementation of price limit measures matures, because the authorities have a basis for controlling prices. This basis is the Central Reserve Bank banknotes, and its ratio to Japanese military scrip has been fixed.

Emphasis on Prices of Daily Necessities

It is widely believed that the control measures will focus on maintaining the prices of daily necessities. As for how the newly established regulations will restrict other prices, it is unknown. But needless to say, unifying prices across regions will ultimately achieve greater results. Whether to start with retail or wholesale restrictions for price controls is the basic issue currently in dispute. Retail prices must be regulated by legislation, while wholesale prices still depend on supply and other important promulgations. The newly established measures will first be implemented in retail stores and department stores. The general public hopes that restrictions can be implemented on food first, because they believe that rice is more important than other supplies.

### Passengers Departing Must Have Stool Test Certificates

This summer, the city authorities have been very strict about epidemic prevention. Since autumn, the weather has been cool, and epidemics have greatly decreased. However, dysentery is an autumn epidemic and is inevitable, so the authorities are paying close attention, especially to passengers on outgoing ships. The Customs Port Quarantine Office has announced that in order to prevent the spread of dysentery, passengers traveling to Ningbo and the ports of Tiangang, Renjiagang, and Chongming Island in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River must have a stool test certificate before they can purchase a ticket. This stool test certificate is only valid for five days. Stool tests can be done at the Tongrenhui Hospital and the Tongrenhui Institute of Epidemic Diseases on Tientong’an Road. After the stool test, you can receive the certificate.

### Suit Store Owner Conspires in Kidnapping; Key Criminals Have Been Arrested

The owners of the Huilixi Suit Store on Avenue Joffre and the Meiyi Water and Electricity Company on Rue Grolier were both kidnapped in the spring of last year. The gang leader, Lang Depei and his brother Lang Deyuan, colluded with Sha Meiqing and others and kidnapped them to the interior for hiding, sending letters to the families to demand ransom. The victims were redeemed by their families. Detectives Shen Lianfang, Mu Hongqi, Xia Guoxiang and others from the French Concession police learned that the clues in the two cases were provided by Sun Jitai (26 years old, currently living above the street in Lane 93, Rue Route Pottier), a tailor at the Huilixi Suit Store who held a grudge against the store owner, Wang Zuyou, for firing him. He conspired with Xin Yuantao, the owner of the Nanyang Suit Store at 291 Avenue Joffre (26 years old), who agreed to entrust the Lang brothers and others to carry out the kidnapping. After obtaining the money, Sun and Xin each took several thousand yuan to spend and lost it all at gambling dens in Nanshi. The detectives went to the addresses on the morning of the day before yesterday and arrested Sun Jitai and Xin Yuantao. They confessed to conspiracy and kidnapping and were taken into custody. The police will investigate the case and arrest the accomplices according to the law.

### Husband, Wife, and Son Die Together; A Tragic Scene on the Starvation Line

Wu Guoshun, a 29-year-old man from Tianjin, was a Chinese policeman No. 511 in the French Concession. He was dismissed from his post two months ago for committing a crime. He has been unemployed ever since and lives at 237 Xinxin Lane, Rue Cardinal Mercier, Dapu Bridge. Recently, he has been in dire straits due to economic hardship and has no way to make a living. At 7:00 PM on the 27th, he and his wife, Wu Han (of the same age as Wu), took their two-month-old son to Room 15 of the Zhushunxing Inn at 379 Dong Zilaihuo Street, Avenue Edward VII, to spend the night. Because he saw no way out, he decided to commit suicide. His wife, Han, also wanted to die with him. The couple took poison that night and fed the poison to their child, killing themselves together. At 10:00 AM the next morning, the waiter discovered that Wu and his family were all dying and reported it to the French police. They were taken to the Guangci Hospital by car, but it was too late. The bodies were sent to the morgue. Yesterday, his father, Guishan (65 years old), arrived, but he could not afford to claim the body for burial, so the charity hall provided a coffin for burial. This is also a victim of the current life pressure, and it is truly tragic.

Every Penny Goes to Public Service

The Shen Bao's reader-supported student aid movement has received enthusiastic support and generous donations from people from all walks of life, for which we express our deepest gratitude. This demonstrates the genuine sincerity of all sectors of society in valuing education, rescuing the impoverished, and nurturing talent. In recent years, all sectors of society have been advocating for a frugal living movement, diverting extravagant spending to useful purposes, either to aid the poor and orphaned or to benefit impoverished students. This is a commendable and admirable trend in society. Therefore, in the past, readers have often saved on wedding and funeral expenses and donated to student aid, such as the Ding Bian family using funds originally intended for Mrs. Ding's sixtieth birthday and ninetieth birthday celebrations for education, and Yao's mother's funeral offerings being used to establish a fund to help children out of school. These are just a few prominent examples. All donations received from readers for the student aid work organized by this newspaper will not be used for any other purpose. In addition to daily announcements in the newspaper, aid disbursements will be made by this newspaper issuing checks payable to the school, which can be cashed at the Central Bank. All accounts will be meticulously managed without any errors. Even the paper, printing, and other expenses necessary for the student aid work, which are considerable, will be covered by this newspaper. Not a single cent will be used from the reader's student aid donations. This is an absolute guarantee to our readers. As for the student aid work itself, it is all done on a voluntary basis by the staff of this newspaper. Given the trust placed in us by our readers, we dare not be negligent. We will handle everything with utmost care, and when encountering any doubts, we will not hesitate to go through tedious procedures to ensure a thorough understanding, in order to put our minds at ease.

The market mainly settled transactions and offered mere embellishments. Price fluctuations hovered between two and three jiao, indicating a stalemate between bullish and bearish views. The trend seems to be in an incubation period, awaiting developments. Except for a slight increase of one jiao for Type A bonds, there were no significant changes in the price of other bonds. The transaction volume was approximately one million yuan. The following is a table of prices:

### New Seeds of Cucumis melo var. agrestis Naudin (Langfang Variety) Arrive

After the new black melon seeds arrived, the source remained scarce, as the price negotiation was difficult. The first batch of Langfang seeds, consisting of dozens of bags, has arrived. The goods are of good quality, with large seeds and dark color, and they are dry. The opening price is 535 yuan.

### Ramie Branches (Lan Zhu Zhi) Have Been Released; Costs Are Very Low

With the arrival of a large quantity of new ramie branches (lan zhu zhi), market prices are not easily favorable. Yesterday, several thousand boxes of goods were released, with prices differing between merchants by 40 to 50 yuan. Because merchants need to sort through the goods after purchasing, removing broken shells, small grains, and slightly moldy ones, the standard sorted ramie branches are priced at 430 yuan, which only leaves a small profit after accounting for costs.

Family

### Introspection

— Hua

The easiest conversations to hear within the family are like, "Mrs. Zhang is so lucky because her husband has become a wealthy man." "Why do you always stick to your profession? Why don't you think about developing?" "I've been married to you for so many years and haven't enjoyed a single moment of happiness."

The best solution to these conversations is "introspection." Because everyone's experiences, circumstances, interests, desires, and efforts are different. Others may succeed because their opportunities are different, or because they've put in a lot of hard work. Maybe they also have unspeakable pain. What's the point of simply envying others?

Conversely, everyone should introspect. To what extent have I tried? What aspects of my current environment are better than others? What are my interests, and what are my plans? After this introspection, one will no longer envy others for no reason.

The interests of a couple should be the same. Therefore, a husband should discuss his plans with his wife. The wife should not adopt a negative attitude or even laugh at her husband's plans. If there are inappropriate aspects, she can express her opinions. If she agrees, she can give her husband all possible assistance so that the plan can be realized as soon as possible. Because this kind of heartfelt assistance is a very important link between the present and the future.

### Games and Children

— Ding Zhidao

In the growth of children, rich nutrition is essential. Proteins, fats, starches, vitamins, and minerals such as calcium, phosphorus, and iron are the building blocks of the human body. Lacking any of these can lead to disease or hinder the child's growth. Many parents often pay great attention to nutrition. However, they often overlook the fact that children, in addition to needing nutrition from food, also need appropriate games.

Children are active, and they regard games as their second life. In the eyes of adults, games are merely tools for regulating the spirit. But for children, in addition to regulating their body and mind, games can also develop the functions of the senses, strengthen their muscles and bones, promote intelligence, and cultivate their abilities to observe, imagine, and create. In modern education, games are used to instill various knowledge, train them in group living, and cultivate good virtues. Therefore, the value of games, in addition to developing the physique, is also a gateway for children to acquire knowledge and morality.

Many conservative parents treat their children as small adults. Besides reading and writing, children are not allowed to move around and must sit there obediently and respectfully. Imagine: a lively and active child, under these circumstances, not only loses the opportunity to move but also loses the opportunity for intellectual development. As a result, both the body and mind are not liberated, and the development of inherent abilities is hindered.

Many "problem children" in schools come from families that are too strictly managed and lack games. The behavior of these children is often abnormal, and their minds are often distorted. Some of them are dull and listless, while others have no intention of studying and are restless. They are not focused on their work and studies and cannot fully adapt to group life. Wise teachers in schools are often at a loss for these children. Because unless the family abandons its strict policies, the school cannot release their mental chains in just a few hours each day, and can only watch them gradually become serious "problem children" who are difficult to treat.

Excessive or inappropriate games can easily lead to disasters, but appropriate and good games are indispensable for every growing child. I think every parent hopes their children are lively, smart, and clever. Then I will tell you the only effective method, which is to give them more opportunities for valuable games. Let the children learn everything in games, strengthen their physique, and develop their intelligence. Let them grow up in games and become useful talents with excellent character!

### Twenty Letters from the Grant Family

Translated by Xu Baiyi

Parents often find it difficult to educate their children, especially those who are studying in middle school or university. And the issue of pocket money is even more difficult for many parents to resolve. The second letter here discusses this issue, and Mr. Grant's argument may be what many parents want to say.

This second letter was sent after Mr. Grant received his son's pocket money account two years after he was at school.

Second Letter: The Pocket Money Problem

Dear Son:

Today, the accounting office gave me your pocket money account for last month, and I was amazed. You must know that although I hope you will acquire a lot of knowledge, I don't want you to buy the entire school! Of course, your expenses won't cause me any significant harm, but they are harmful to yourself unless you pay close attention. For two years, your pocket money account has been increasing, but you have not demonstrated that there is a sufficient reason for this increase, which is truly unreasonable.

For this term, I haven't said anything to you before because I believe you have reason and know how to govern yourself. But because I am in charge of everything, don't think that your father can use the money however he wants, because I will not continue to provide for you after you leave university. By then, the quicker you restrict your spending, the closer you will get to your earning power.

The fastest way for a person to get rich is to suddenly receive a large sum of money or inherit a fortune from their father, but you will never get rich that way because unless you prove yourself capable of holding an important position in my company, I will not easily trust you. Of course, anyone can get a starting point, whether it is the owner of the company or a small employee, and that starting point is the lowest position. They can sit next to a mail station, and every Saturday I will give him a salary of eight dollars.

I can't hand you ready-made success with both hands, because that is not good for you and is extremely damaging to the company.

I want to say these things to you for no other reason than to prevent you from misunderstanding, because although I can give you a starting point, you still have to work hard yourself.

I think you have considerable talent, and I am very pleased this term. But I hope I can see these talents being developed. And you must also uphold the natural principle of learning how to use money properly before earning it. Only by reducing your expenses and increasing your savings will opportunities come your way. The interest on one dollar is at most six cents, but a smart person will only use six cents and save his one dollar. This is what you should be learning.

Many young people think that it is beautiful to spend money generously, and it is inevitable to be stingy to haggle over money. This is exactly what most parents worry about. However, from another perspective, this is exactly where a young person's ability to judge strongly is displayed. When I only had a salary of two dollars a week and slept under the counter at night, I still have a deep impression, and this is exactly what you should start learning.

Your father, Grant

### Be Friends with Children

— Li

Effective methods for raising children

Wise parents generally do not adopt the strictest attitude when raising their children. Their first step is to become close friends with their children. In this way, children will not be restrained when they see their parents, and it will be easier to educate them. Here are some methods that can be adopted:

If you can help children with their work or games, help them as much as possible.

If children have something worth rewarding, immediately give them enthusiastic encouragement.

When children express their opinions, listen carefully.

Do not talk about children's shortcomings in front of relatives and friends as material for your conversation.

In this era of burgeoning insurance companies, some fire insurance knowledge for the readers of "Family": Generally, people believe that insurance is for ensuring peace of mind, so they insure just a little. Actually, this is a mistake. If you're not going to insure at all, then that's one thing. But if you are, you must insure the full value of the insured item. This is because the principle of insurance is to compensate you for the original value of your loss in the event of a fire. If you don't insure fully, and a total loss occurs, even if the insurance company compensates you according to the amount you insured, wouldn't you still have a loss? Moreover, there are often many restrictions when it comes to compensation. To make things clearer for you, I will now give an example to illustrate:

For example, the market value of the furniture in your house is estimated to be 100,000, but because you want to save on insurance premiums, you only insure it for 50,000. If a fire breaks out and all your furniture is burned, the insurance company will, of course, compensate you for the 50,000 that you insured. But in reality, you still lost 50,000. Suppose only half of your furniture is burned, and the market value is estimated to be a loss of 50,000. You might think that since you insured for 50,000 and now lost 50,000, the insurance company should compensate you 50,000, right? Actually, that's not the case. The insurance company will only compensate you 25,000 because you only insured half of the value of your furniture, which is worth 100,000. You are responsible for the other half. You and the insurance company share half the responsibility. So, now that you've lost 50,000, even though you insured for 50,000, you can only be compensated 25,000. You can only ask yourself for the remaining 25,000! In other cases, if the original insured amount is only one-third or one-quarter of the original value, the compensation is also proportional to that ratio. Perhaps someone will say, "That furniture was only worth 50,000 when I insured it, but it has risen to 100,000 at the time of the fire. The policyholder couldn't have known in advance, so how could they have insured it for 100,000 in advance?" Then you should have increased the insurance when the furniture's price increased. It wouldn't have jumped from 50,000 to 100,000 in one step; it would have gradually increased. You should have increased the insurance each time it went up. When issuing an insurance policy for an item, you should insure it according to the actual value of the item. The more accurate, the better. When the insured item's price increases, you should increase the insurance. When it decreases, you can reduce the insurance. In short, you must ensure that when the item is damaged, you can still get enough compensation to restore the original item. If someone has a "gambling" mentality and insures something worth 100,000 for 200,000, thinking that they can earn an extra 100,000 in the event of a fire, then this person is truly an "amateur." The insurance company won't be fooled by you. In the event of a loss, they will have a public appraisal firm come out to estimate the actual value of the loss. They will never compensate you 200,000 for a loss of 100,000. Insuring for more is just paying more premiums.

Many people insure, receive the insurance policy, and then hide it in a box without even looking at it. This is absolutely not allowed because every insurance policy contains many clauses. When an insurance company gives you a fire insurance policy, they cannot indiscriminately insure you against all kinds of risks. They also have their restrictions. These restrictions are all stated in these clauses. For example, if you insure ordinary residential insurance, the insurance policy will state that you are not allowed to place more than 50 gallons of kerosene or gasoline or more than five boxes of matches (except for boxes lined with tinplate) in the house. If the policyholder violates this clause, the policy will be declared invalid. The insurance company will not send someone to check whether you have placed these dangerous goods in your house, but if nothing happens, that's fine. However, if a fire breaks out and it is discovered after investigation that more than the above-mentioned quantity of kerosene or matches were stored in the house, then there will be a problem with your compensation. Furthermore, each insurance company specifically notes on the policy: "The insured must pay special attention to the various clauses printed on this insurance policy. Anyone who accepts this insurance policy agrees to be bound by the terms of the agreement." The insurance company has solemnly declared this to the policyholder. But the general policyholder thinks that as long as they have insurance, they can always get compensation if something happens, and they don't bother to look at the clauses. As a result, disputes between insurance companies and policyholders often occur. Although some small companies may have shortcomings in terms of compensation, or some insurance brokers may be causing trouble, resulting in policyholders not receiving full compensation, the general lack of insurance knowledge and not understanding the true principles of insurance is also a major reason.

### Dental Hygiene

— Zhi

Human health depends on hygiene and cleanliness. As the saying goes, "Things must first rot before worms grow in them." These are wise words. However, our people have always not valued dental hygiene, so eight or nine out of ten people suffer from tooth decay, which is really lamentable. It is found that tooth decay is mostly caused by food debris left in the gaps between teeth during chewing. After temperature action, it changes and becomes pus bacteria and acid-producing bacteria. This kind of poisonous bacteria can destroy the enamel of the gums and successfully corrode them. Here are a few points:

Teeth are the movement of chewing food and also help the stage of digestion. If teeth are not healthy, swallowing food whole will be tasteless, and digestion will be difficult, which will hinder the stomach and intestines or cause the danger of other diseases.

And the human oral cavity contains various bacteria, so if we want to maintain our body health, we must pay attention to oral hygiene. Scientific teeth cleaning can make the oral cavity clean, prevent tooth decay, and prevent bacteria from sneaking in. Therefore, Western ladies attach great importance to protecting their teeth, and clean their teeth once a day.

Small cavities in teeth are places to hide dirt and accept dirt. Each small hole contains tens of millions of bacteria. Each time you chew, the bacteria in the hole mix with food and swallow into the stomach and intestines, which can easily cause typhoid fever, dysentery and other symptoms. If it is big, it can be fatal, and if it is small, it will waste money and time, so in order to prevent problems before they happen, it is necessary to clean up and disinfect the dirt in the cavities.

Teeth cleaning, hair cutting, and bathing are the three major elements of human health, and teeth cleaning is even more important, which can eliminate bad breath and tooth stains, make teeth clean and shiny, and prevent bacteria from sneaking into the body, so health can be maintained. This is the happiness of life. However, teeth cleaning must start from a young age to prevent it. When you are old, you can still maintain healthy teeth and have no tooth problems for the rest of your life.

When our people nurture infants, they always chew and feed their children from the mouths of adults. If the mouths of adults are not clean, the poisonous bacteria will mix with food and pass it on to the children, and the children have weak resistance and often get sick, and even die prematurely. Laocha Engineering Bureau's Health Department's child mortality rate is tens of thousands per year, which is shocking to hear.

The elderly in our country do not know how to protect their teeth at ordinary times, so in middle age, their teeth are floating and various tooth problems occur. When they enter their twilight years, their teeth are incomplete, which damages their appearance. If they encounter slightly hard food, it is difficult to swallow and digest, which affects their health. Therefore, if we want to avoid old age suffering, we must clean our teeth early.

Modern women often pay attention to the decoration of their hair and skin, but ignore their teeth. If they can clean their teeth at all times, when they smile, their teeth will be like braids, clean and shiny, which will increase their charm. If their teeth are not clean, the bad breath will be offensive, making people disgusted and regrettable.

Normal people have more than thirty teeth, each with four sides and eight directions. When we get up in the morning, even if we gargle and brush our teeth every day, it is only superficial cleaning. The gaps between the teeth and the back of the teeth cannot be completely cleaned. If we clean our teeth scientifically, we can clean up the dirt on our teeth for many years, improve our health, and get a lot of benefits. Therefore, dental hygiene is also a major event in life.

### A Week's Home-Style Menu

— Ms. Hua Ying

Mr. Ding Fubao's book "How to Create My Healthy Life" recommends beans and their products such as tofu, soy milk, etc., saying that they contain a lot of protein. Fish and meat are too expensive, so you can eat more beans to get enough protein. Protein is the body's nutrients, enough to increase our energy, which is known to everyone. During this richest period of beans, we should eat more of them, such as broad beans, lentils, edamame, cowpeas, etc., which can be eaten in large quantities, and supplemented with tofu, sprouted beans, soybean sprouts, and jade bean sprouts, which can be said to be a grand view, a great collection of beans. If you can't afford fish and meat, why not replace them with beans to increase the nutrients in our body?
