### Continued Japanese Announcements: War Results of Attacking Dutch Harbor, Australian Prime Minister Curtin's Broadcast Speech

Tokyo, 18th (Domei News Agency) - The Imperial Japanese Headquarters announced at 3:30 PM today that, according to confirmed detailed reports, the Japanese Navy attacked Dutch Harbor in the Aleutian Islands on the 4th and 5th of this month, shooting down 21 enemy aircraft and destroying most of the military equipment.

Lisbon, 18th (Domei News Agency) - According to sources in Canberra, Australian Prime Minister Curtin delivered a pessimistic broadcast speech to the Australian people last night, stating, "I dare to say that Australia may fall. Australia is currently facing the danger of being attacked. The terrible situation that the Soviet Union is currently experiencing may be seen in Australia. The war news from the Libyan front is unfavorable, and the war there has reached a critical juncture. If the Allied powers suffer a complete defeat in the Middle East, the Axis powers will control the Suez Canal, which will have a significant impact on Australia. As for the Allied ships sunk by Axis submarines, the number is extremely large. The current annual shipbuilding capacity is insufficient to compensate for the losses."

Lisbon, 17th (Domei News Agency) - According to sources in London, Australian Prime Minister Curtin's broadcast speech to the Australian people yesterday was prominently featured in all London evening newspapers. Curtin stated in his speech that the battles in the Coral Sea, Midway, and the Aleutian Islands were not decisive. Australia has not yet overcome the crisis. If the Japanese army occupies Australia, the entire Pacific coast from Hawaii and from Alaska through Canada, the United States, and to Mexico will be in danger of being attacked.

Lisbon, 17th (Domei News Agency) - After the Japanese army suppressed the Pacific and Indian Oceans, the threat to Australia, the only stronghold of the anti-Axis Allied forces, has greatly increased. Coupled with the continuous bombing of key areas on the northern coast of Australia by Japanese aircraft, the Australian people are even more uneasy. According to reports from Melbourne, Australian Prime Minister Curtin, after discussing wartime countermeasures with Allied Commander General MacArthur on the 17th, delivered a broadcast speech to the nation, informing them that Australia is now facing a major crisis, urging national unity. He said that Australia has tasted the suffering of submarine warfare (referring to the Japanese special submarines' surprise attack on Sydney). Australian ships have been sunk at sea, and the rate of ship losses exceeds shipbuilding capacity. However, the protection of Australia by the United Nations is the most important event related to the war situation.

Lisbon, 17th (Domei News Agency) - According to Reuters Melbourne, the Southwest Pacific Joint Command announced on the 17th that Japanese air force units again raided military facilities in Darwin and Port Moresby on the 16th. The bombing of Darwin was extremely fierce, with fires breaking out in several places in the port, and black smoke covering the sky. Japanese aircraft have been continuously bombing the port with large formations for four days since the 13th. The Australian authorities have admitted that this is an unprecedented large-scale air raid.

### Extremely Hot Weather in North Africa, Fierce Battles Approaching Climax, British Troops Defending Tobruk Area Retreat from El Adem and Sidi Rezegh

German Supreme Headquarters, 18th (Haitong News Agency) - Today's German military report states that the British Eighth Army in North Africa has been divided. One part has retreated towards Tobruk, and a strong German-Italian armored force is pursuing British soldiers retreating towards Bardia. Several British fortresses south of Tobruk have been captured. The German Malta torpedo boat sank a destroyer and an escort ship each near the Libyan coast. Another "submarine destroyer" and 15,000 tons of supplies carried by an enemy ship were also sunk.

Lisbon, 18th (Domei News Agency) - The fierce battles in the eastern Libyan Cyrenaica desert have lasted for three weeks and are approaching their climax today. After the British troops under General Ritchie were forced to retreat from El Adem towards the Egyptian border, General Rommel's armored forces have surrounded Tobruk. News received today from Cairo indicates that the German threat to Tobruk is quite serious, and the German desert army is in danger of reaching the British defensive positions along the Mediterranean coast. It is reported that the German encirclement of the Tobruk defenses has yet to be completed, so there is still one route leading to Tobruk, namely the coastal highway to the east. Reports from British sources indicate that Allied mobile units are still trying to prevent the German advance on Tobruk, but this news does not conceal the seriousness of the situation faced by the British forces in Libya. The British official communiqué released in Cairo today announced that British forces have been forced to retreat from El Adem and Sidi Rezegh, but did not specify the details of the retreat route. Axis sources state that German-Italian aircraft are active in the war zone, repeatedly bombing the retreating British columns, and the mopping-up operation in the Gazala area is nearing completion.

Lisbon, 18th (Domei News Agency) - According to reports from Cairo, officials announced that the British troops defending the Tobruk area in Libya have been forced to retreat from El Adem and Sidi Rezegh.

Bern, Switzerland, 17th (Havas News Agency) - Newspapers quote German military sources in Berlin as saying that the approaching summer and hot weather in North Africa will make things difficult for both armies. It is expected that the fighting will subside. At the same time, according to reports from London, newspapers do not conceal the seriousness of the situation. However, if the German army cannot invade the Caucasus, thereby threatening the Near East, then British Commander-in-Chief of the Middle East General Auchinleck will not only be able to defend Egypt, but will also be able to launch a major counter-offensive in mid-summer or early autumn.

Somewhere on the Libyan border, 17th (Havas News Agency) - The latest news from the front indicates that the fighting has subsided in the past two days. Yesterday, the main battlefield appeared to be in the El Adem area south of Tobruk. General Rommel's strategy seems to be to cut off the British lines of communication with Tobruk, so as to completely encircle the British forces. As for the Axis armored units, they have not been very active in the past two days, and the fighting has eased somewhat. It is speculated that this is because they need to wait for reinforcements to arrive before launching a large-scale offensive. The British defensive line runs from a certain point along the coast to the northwest of Acroma, turning south to reach El Adem and Bir Hakeim, a total length of 50 miles. However, the British have also built strong defensive works in the El Adem area. In addition, a large German force, under the cover of tanks and artillery, attacked the city of Sidi Rezegh. At the same time, Axis forces reoccupied the town of Tammar west of the city. British military experts insist that it will not be easy for the German High Command to obtain sufficient water supplies. However, in terms of tanks, their number is still far greater than that of the British. Recently, 300 tanks were destroyed by British forces in the fighting in the Knightsbridge and Acroma areas and are currently being repaired. General Ritchie's troops are continuously moving from the east to assist the Eighth Army in resisting the strong enemy. Judging from the recent naval battles in the Mediterranean, it can be seen that the British are making every effort to transport military supplies to North Africa at any cost. In short, whether the British High Command sends reinforcements to strengthen the British forces' ability to hold the line at Acroma and El Adem, so that Tobruk will not be completely encircled by the enemy, will completely determine the future development of the war. Switzerland will send personnel to accompany

### Fierce Battles on the Outskirts of Sevastopol; Germans Deploy Huge Guns on High Ground, Each Shell Weighing Over Six Tons

German Supreme Headquarters, 18th (Haitong News Agency) - Today's German military report states that German infantry and engineers fighting in the Sevastopol area, with the assistance of artillery and aircraft, are attacking the main defensive works in the north. Among them, the newest and strongest fortification is the Maxim Gorky Battery. German troops are now only three kilometers away from the port of Sevastopol. The Soviet troops on the southern side of the port's fortress, although resisting stubbornly, have been driven back to the hilltop positions. Food depots and grain ships in the port have been destroyed by German aircraft. The fighting in the central section of Eastern Europe continues.

Berlin, 18th (Haitong News Agency) - An urgent telegram from the German military command states that German troops have broken through the northern defensive line of Sevastopol and captured several fortresses.

Somewhere on the Ukrainian Front, 18th (Havas News Agency) - The battle on the outskirts of Sevastopol is still in a stalemate, but the ferocity of the fighting has not diminished. It is reported that German troops have deployed newly occupied heavy artillery on the high ground in the northeast corner of the city. Its caliber is even larger than the famous "Big Bertha" artillery used by the German army to bombard Paris during the First World War. The shells used weigh more than six tons each. However, the city is shrouded in smoke and flames, visibility is impaired, and artillery operations are difficult. German aircraft bombing operations are also quite difficult. German aircraft began dropping aerial landmines several days ago. The Red Army, with the airfield near the port of Sevastopol destroyed by German forces and unusable, dispatched a Stalin-class aircraft carrier to the port to assist in the battle. Although the number of aircraft carried by the ship is small, it is enough to provide some assistance to the defenders. As for the Red Army units that landed in a surprise attack behind German lines, south of Eupatoria, north of Bedenivale, east of Taganrog, and in various parts of Balaklava, they are now engaged in hand-to-hand combat with German forces. In the area east of Kharkov, after crossing the Donets River, German forces continue to advance towards the northeast. The fighting is currently taking place between the river and another tributary. In other areas, the fighting in the Keresk region has intensified in the last fourteen hours. The Red Army is attacking in several locations, and several villages in the Vorbaansk region have been gained and lost several times. Both sides have sent reinforcements. Although German forces are temporarily maintaining the initiative, it is difficult to determine the overall situation, because the forces of the two armies are evenly matched and are both in superior positions.

The Battle of Kharkov Continues

Bear City, July 11th (Domei News Agency)

The massive offensive launched by the German side towards Sevastopol and Balaklava, the Soviet Union's last ports on the western coast of the Black Sea, did not ease on Wednesday night. German forces launched a total of eleven attacks on the Soviet defensive positions in these two places. To date, German forces have been advancing in the Sevastopol area for two weeks. Berlin broadcast also reported that German forces have captured the Siberian Fortress in front of the port. According to the latest war news, German forces have launched six fierce attacks on the important roads in the north of the Soviet base, and five equally fierce attacks on the northern defenses of the area. The ferocity of the fighting is even greater than in November and December of last year. News this afternoon stated that the Soviet side claimed to still be holding the roads leading to Sevastopol and Balaklava. The Soviet communiqué at noon today only stated that there were no major changes on the front line. At the same time, the Second Battle of Kharkov is still ongoing. German forces in the area, accompanied by a large number of armored vehicles, are constantly attacking with the help of infantry and artillery, maintaining the initiative and repelling multiple Red Army counterattacks.

### Nehru Supports Gandhi, Urges Britain to Return Political Power; Anti-British Tide Among the Hur Tribe Increases, Sindh Province Falls into Chaos

Tokyo, 18th (Domei News Agency) - The Nichinichi Shimbun carries a special report from Lisbon stating that Indian National Congress leader Nehru spoke in Bombay on the 17th, criticizing Britain's demand for British-Indian cooperation. According to Reuters Bombay, Nehru stated on the evening of the 17th that he fully supported Gandhi's call for the complete withdrawal of British forces from India, and demanded that the British government return political power to India. At the same time, he further explained that if the British government could accommodate the above-mentioned demands of India, India would solve its own defense problems independently. Therefore, if India cannot achieve complete independence, it will be difficult for various issues between Britain and India to be resolved peacefully.

Lisbon, 17th (Domei News Agency) - The Indian anti-British movement, aimed at fighting for national independence, has become even more likely to succeed since the Congress Party elder Gandhi and Nehru reached a complete consensus in their meeting in Wardha. Gandhi published another article in the "Harijan" newspaper on the 17th, again demanding that the British leave India, in which case India would establish an Indian government composed of representatives of the Congress Party, the Muslim League, etc. However, if this government adopts my views, it will no longer assist the United Nations. When Britain withdraws from India, the Indian army should also be disbanded immediately. However, if Britain and the United States do not withdraw their hands of aggression from India in the past, the theory of human freedom will have no value.

Tokyo, 18th (Domei News Agency) - According to the Yomiuri Shimbun, a special report from Zurich, Switzerland, states that the rebellion of the Hur tribe in Sindh province in northwestern India is now receiving increasingly strong support from Muslims. Events such as cutting telephone lines and destroying roads are constantly occurring, and the entire province is in a state of anarchic chaos. The situation is extremely serious. Gandhi has also requested the state government to resign immediately so that he can come forward to mediate and find a solution. However, the British Indian government has rejected this mediation, begun a military crackdown, and arrested the majority of the Hur tribe members. However, given the deep-rooted anti-British sentiment of the Indian people, it is practically impossible for the British authorities to completely suppress the Hur tribe.

Rome, June 17 (Havas News Agency) – A responsible official here stated that Italian warships had engaged in a naval battle with British warships in the central Mediterranean Sea near Sicily.

### Talking About Eating

Eating treats hunger; therefore, the amount of food consumed should be based on not being hungry (not being hungry and being full are absolutely different). A slightly empty stomach is not bad, but being full is even worse. Sometimes half-hungry, sometimes half-full, is the most appropriate and best (as is the case for those who work during the day and rest at night to regulate their bodies). Sometimes being hungry does not harm health; sometimes being full and stuffy easily causes illness. Therefore, when eating, it is better to eat less than enough and never eat too much. Excessive eating forces the stomach to abandon part of its responsibility and hastily hand it over to the large intestine. The intestines then press down layer by layer, causing undigested food to accumulate at the lower end of the large intestine. As a result, bowel movements become constipated, and inflammation occurs over time, leading to hemorrhoids. Since the food is already excessive and bowel movements are difficult, the residue in the intestines accumulates more and more, causing hot and turbid air to rise and fumigate upwards, resulting in bad breath, sore throat, eye problems, dizziness, sores, insomnia, and other symptoms that are bound to occur one after another. The appropriate standard for eating is: a small, shallow bowl for children per meal, and a small bowl for adults. More than that will harm the spirit and not benefit the intestines and stomach.

### Repatriation Ship Scheduled to Set Sail A Total of 636 Repatriated Overseas Chinese Scheduled to Leave Shanghai on the Morning of the 24th

The Shanghai Times reports that according to responsible sources, the Italian postal ship Conte Verde is scheduled to set sail at 11:00 AM on Wednesday, June 24th, carrying approximately 636 repatriated overseas Chinese to Lourenço Marques in Portuguese Africa. One official each from the Swiss Embassy in Tokyo and the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs will accompany the ship for supervision. According to Masaki, a secretary and translator at the Japanese Consulate General in Shanghai, some of the repatriated overseas Chinese have expressed their desire to stay in Shanghai due to relatives' illnesses or other reasons. This reason may cause the total number of repatriated overseas Chinese to change daily. As of today, there are a total of 636 people, including 155 government officials from the consular and diplomatic circles in the occupied areas of China, including 131 , 11 Brazilians, 6 Mexicans, 4 Canadians, and 3 Guatemalans. There are a total of 419 repatriated civilians who have gathered in Shanghai from various cities in the occupied areas of China, 13 from Manila, and 49 overseas Chinese residing in Shanghai. According to sources at the Swiss Consulate, a small number of repatriated overseas Chinese have yet to decide whether to leave, while the rest have received or will receive departure notices within a few days. As for the Swiss and Japanese officials who will accompany the ship to Lourenço Marques to supervise the arrangements and be responsible during the journey, they will arrive in Shanghai from Tokyo soon, or they may be coming on the Conte Verde. The Conte Verde recently sailed to Japan to replenish supplies and will arrive in Shanghai about two days before setting sail for Africa. The exact date has not been disclosed. After completing their mission in Lourenço Marques, the Japanese and Swiss representatives will return to Shanghai to report back.

### All Pawnshops in the French Concession Suspended Pawn Redemption Yesterday Association of Pawnbrokers and Loan Offices Encouraged to Resume Business

Over 180 pawnshops in the French Concession suspended pawn redemption yesterday after receiving Order No. 178 from the French Consul General regarding the management of pawnshops within the concession. However, the terms were extremely harsh, making it easy to violate the law when accepting pawned items. From yesterday morning, all pawnshops suspended pawning and redemption, resulting in a semi-closed state, which was quite serious. The most important clauses are: (Article 4) Pawnshops should only lend money to people whose identity and address are known, or who can prove their identity and address with formal documents, or who have two guarantors known to the pawnshop co-signing the loan book with the pledger to prove their identity and address. (Article 5) All pawned items must be given to the pledger with a pawn ticket, which should include the following items: (A) Name and address of the pawnshop, (B) Name, address, and occupation of the pledger, (C) If there is a guarantor, the guarantor's name, address, and occupation, (D) Date of pawning, (E) Amount of loan, (F) Interest rate, (G) Redemption period for the pledger. (Article 8) If the pawnshop accepts stolen goods, fraudulent goods, or embezzled goods without complying with the provisions of Article 4, the pawnshop manager shall be liable to the victims of theft, fraud, or embezzlement. (Article 12) If a pawnshop accepts pledged items without thoroughly investigating their source, its manager may be prosecuted for receiving stolen goods or negligently accepting objects of unknown origin. (Article 17) Those who violate the provisions of this order and its prohibitions will be fined from one to one thousand yuan. Repeat offenders may be fined up to ten to two thousand yuan. The amount of the fine for violators will be determined by the competent court. After receiving the above clauses yesterday morning, more than 180 pawnshops and loan offices believed that if they followed these regulations, both pawn and loan items would easily violate the law, making it impossible to operate. Starting at 9:00 AM, all pawning and redemption were suspended. At the same time, they requested the Association of Pawnbrokers and the Loan Office Association to plead for the industry. The two associations and offices responded urgently, advising the industry to remain calm and continue to operate as before to avoid affecting the turnover of ordinary people. They have also begun to draft opinions and prepare to submit them to the Consul General to amend the regulations in order to maintain operations.

### Explosion at Alcohol Factory on North Henan Road One Dead, Thirteen Injured

At 9:05 AM yesterday, an explosion occurred suddenly at a certain alcohol factory located at No. 16, Lane 365, North Henan Road. With a loud crash, the rear wall of the factory collapsed, and two locations in the factory caught fire. The roof built on the open space where alcohol was stored was also destroyed. Afterward, one person was found burned to death, and as many as thirteen people were burned. Only the remnants of the factory remained, with the four walls supported by other objects.

Casualty Situation

After the explosion occurred, the Hongkou Fire Brigade rushed to the rescue. At the gate, they saw a person lying prostrate, his head and face charred, and his injuries were very serious. He had lost consciousness, apparently trying to crawl out of the factory building, but he fainted before he could crawl to the middle of the gate. Firefighters then followed the bloodstains on the ground to the lane behind the building, where they found thirteen workers from the factory, exhausted and wandering aimlessly. They had also struggled out of the flames, smoke, and tiles, but they could no longer move forward. These fourteen people were all sent to the Shanghai Convalescent Hospital Clinic on Bazilu Road for treatment. The person found in front of the gate died en route.

Investigation of the Cause

After the explosion, two fires broke out at the same time. Fortunately, the fire was small and quickly extinguished. Personnel from the Public Concession Police and the Fire Brigade began to investigate the cause of the explosion, but as of yesterday afternoon, no important findings had been made. This temporarily converted alcohol factory, the name of the factory owner, and the purpose of his brewing alcohol could not be determined. The place originally employed thirty workers. Apart from the fourteen dead and injured, the rest had all fled, making the investigation difficult.

### Hardware Industry Safely Passes Dragon Boat Festival; Market Shows Prosperity for Various Goods

Hardware industry colleagues safely passed the Dragon Boat Festival yesterday. It happened to be a period when various goods were in short supply and styles were lacking. Although actual sales were still limited, the mindset of industry colleagues did not soften because of this. The reason is that the inventory of various hardware items in this port is not abundant, so the market for various goods is still prosperous. The sales and market conditions of various types of goods are described below:

Straits Tinplate: Current inventory is very tight. Only styles #14 and #26 are available. Checking the market situation for this item, it has been quite lively since yesterday. Most of its uses are for manufacturing rollers for spinning mills. Since the beginning of the month, spinning mills have been resuming work one after another, so the demand for this item has been very strong. Therefore, those holding small amounts of inventory are unwilling to sell easily without a good price. As a result, the market price has risen sharply. For example, style #24 is quoted at 100 yuan per sheet, and style #26 is 70 yuan per sheet, both up by 20-30 yuan each compared to before. Moreover, there are no whole boxes available.

Black Iron Blanks: Transactions continue one after another, but the volume is not large. Purchasers mainly include enamel blank factories in this street, followed by tin printing factories, thermos factories, etc., which also collect them. Although there is no risk of running out of stock of this item at present, the source is not continuing, and shortages are inevitable in the long run, so the market shows a prosperous trend. The industry's mindset is also firm, and the market is extremely brisk. Yesterday, 2,000 pounds of goods required 14,000 yuan per ton, an increase of several hundred yuan compared to before.

Local Factory Wire Nails: The nail market has been brisk for many days. Although merchants from the Nanyang and Northern routes are all clear on business, their production is also limited. The inventory of raw materials (wire rod) in the Shanghai market is thin, and many nail factories are reducing or stopping work. As a result, the circulation of goods is lacking.囤户 (speculators) also absorb stock from time to time, so it is inevitable that prices are high. In addition, the industry's mindset is also firm, and the outlook is good. Yesterday, the market price for "倍司" (beis, a unit of weight) was quoted at around 800 yuan.

### Teochew Branches Out of Stock

Although a batch of Teochew branches arrived this week, the customs procedures at the source are not yet complete. A large amount of tax money must be deposited before the goods can be released first. However, the customer did not want to sell this item urgently and refused to deposit the tax, so it has not been declared, resulting in a severe shortage of spot goods. As a result, the price has increased by one or two hundred yuan, and the trend is firm.

### Fennel New Offers Increase Repeatedly

Fennel was previously slow-moving, and the unofficial price reduction was very sharp, with a difference of five or six hundred yuan. Since the financial changes, the price has rebounded. Recently, there has been a new high. Market offers have repeatedly increased. Today's selling price is 1,100 yuan.

### Zhong Kui Spends the Dragon Boat Festival

— Yuan Ying

Recently, Immortal Zhong Kui has been feeling very uncomfortable, mainly because the price of wine has risen and the ghosts are too thin. Although he can temporarily refrain from drinking wine, it is not easy to save to the point of not even eating ghosts. He has to fill his stomach! Besides, our immortal has always regarded it as his responsibility to specialize in eating ghosts and demons!

The Dragon Boat Festival has finally arrived again. As usual, his sister should send some wine and ghosts to honor her brother. However, our immortal waited anxiously for a few days, but still did not see a single ghost. This made our immortal a little angry. Could it be that people have swallowed the elixir of immortality?

Zhong Kui hesitated for a while and decided to personally descend to the mortal world to investigate what was going on. Although the cost of living is high, one should not starve on the Dragon Boat Festival! Besides, this is a festival that only comes once a year!

Grasping his sword, he began to descend to the mortal world.

First, he came to Shanghai. This place used to be a frequent haunt of the immortal. He had many satisfying and plump lunches here. There were all kinds of ghosts here: lustful ghosts, gambling ghosts, opium ghosts (and the slightly lesser white powder ghosts).

However, our immortal looked for a long time but still couldn't see a single ghost. Maybe it was late at night, and the little ghosts had all hidden in their lairs. So he sniffed and began a patrol in the dark night.

Suddenly, his pace quickened because he saw some thin ghosts squatting in front of a rice store. Although they were thin, it was better than nothing, so he grabbed a few.

"We are here to buy rice!" The ghosts being grabbed loudly protested. But to our immortal, that was such a weak sound!

"Then you are humans?" The immortal was a little surprised.

"Yes!"

"Humans also have to eat!" The immortal was a bit indiscriminate.

"No! Immortal, spare us!" The people being grabbed pleaded, "This humble one has an eighty-year-old mother and a two-year-old child at home. Tomorrow is the Dragon Boat Festival, please let this humble one buy some rice to take home to eat. This humble one hasn't eaten a grain of rice in over twenty days!"

"Nonsense! If you haven't eaten for a few days, you wouldn't have turned into a ghost? You're simply trying to deny it!"

"We haven't eaten rice, but we've eaten corn flour, soybean noodles... Immortal, you may not know, but how many families in Shanghai can afford to eat rice now?"

Zhong Kui was disappointed and surprised. There were no ghosts to eat, and the humans were so thin. Could it be that immortals should starve?

Back in heaven, he received a short letter from his sister:

"The price of Zhuangyuan's mung bean pastries has also risen, so I have no choice but to stop sending them this Dragon Boat Festival."

Zhong Kui spent the Dragon Boat Festival bored. Touching his sword, he sighed. Let's wait for next year's Dragon Boat Festival!

### Success

— Xin Lü

Success is filled with crises before it, and similarly, success is filled with crises after it.

The crisis before success is the fear of unexpected changes along the way, failing to achieve the goal. The crisis after success is the fear that after achieving the goal, one will stop fighting, relax the spirit of striving before success: even to the point of indulging in enjoyment and extravagance – which can be called a complete failure – and going down that road.

However, most people only care about before success and neglect after success.

We must have the ability to break through the difficulties before success: we must have even more ability not to be constrained by the various bad habits after success. Because failure after success is more terrible than failure before success; it is more tragic!

### Bottomless Pit That Can't Be Filled

— Feng Ma Niu

A hole in the black iron pot, a hole in the umbrella, a hole in the washbasin, a hole in the enamel basin, the husband's rubber overshoes leaked rainwater, staining the patched socks yellow, a hole in the son's old shirt – holes, all these holes, troubled Mrs. Huang for most of the day. Mrs. Huang is not Nüwa, she doesn't have the ability to mend the sky. Mrs. Huang can handle socks or shirts, but for enamel basins and iron pots, she has to ask the repairmen shouting in the alley for advice, and it's urgent. At night, she relies on the pot to cook, and on rainy days, she relies on the rubber overshoes to run to the "沃非司" (office); looking at these things makes her angry. The pot has had its bottom replaced three times, and the rubber overshoes are like a dead yellow fish with its gills open. Getting angry, she really wants to throw them in the trash and buy new ones! New ones, Mrs. Huang has been looking forward to for a long time, wanting to buy them again and again, but finding them too expensive. Little did she know that the longer she waited, the more expensive they became. When the pot had its first bottom replaced, she wanted to buy a new one, but it was only forty: when it had its second bottom replaced, it was already seventy-something, "If I had known, I could have bought two." Now, it's really not worth it, so she procrastinates. The pot has a third hole, she decides to throw it away and buy a new one. She asks Mr. Huang, but Mr. Huang shakes his head vigorously: "What are you buying? Just use it as it is. We still have to buy rice and oil. Fix it and use it. A new one costs over a hundred!" Mrs. Huang's "determination" was punctured, she became silent, silently harboring a "half-hating it, half-loving it" feeling, and carrying the pot, she went to find the vendor who repairs lead buckets and pots.

She found the vendor. Mrs. Huang, with her old qualifications, asked: "How much to replace the bottom?"

The repairman took the pot and looked at it, saying: "I'll give you a cheaper price, fourteen 洋 (silver dollars)."

Mrs. Huang was shocked, but she was used to this kind of shock. A second later, she calmed down again, thinking of haggling over the price. She thought for a moment and opened her mouth: "Five 洋, will you do it?"

The repairman pushed the pot back to her, "No, do you know the price of white iron? For five 洋, I can only fix a ladle." He turned his head and walked away with his load.

Mrs. Huang had to use the "retain" method: "Eight 洋!" Otherwise, she wouldn't be able to eat dinner; buying a new one would cost over a hundred, she held her breath and called the repairman back.

The repairman turned his load back, and so they argued about the price. The repairman said "no" more than three times, and Mrs. Huang put on a "seven captures, seven releases" attitude to deal with it, but in the end, she couldn't out-argue the repairman. Eleven 洋 was the final price, not a penny less.

Mrs. Huang felt like she had fought a battle. She had thought eight 洋 would be enough, but she exceeded the "limit" by one - Mrs. Huang had fought a losing battle and had to accept it silently.

While supervising the repair of the pot, she asked the shoemaker at the entrance of the alley about the price of repairing the rubber overshoes. It would cost at least eight or nine yuan to fill the yellow fish gills. She also thought about repairing her son's leather shoes, otherwise they would get more and more worn out. But when she asked, she was shocked again. Replacing a pair of front and back soles would cost over twenty! "In the past, I could have bought a pair of calfskin shoes, but it's a pity I didn't buy a pair for A-jian." Mrs. Huang habitually had "nostalgic" worries.

She took the repaired pot back home to cook dinner. Her son and husband both returned. The younger son clung to his mother: "Mom, my fountain pen is leaking ink again, and it's hard to write. I want to get it fixed, Mom, give me money, I have a big exam tomorrow." Her son was a good son, he didn't ask to buy a new one.

And her husband, sitting on the edge of the bed, tapping the edge of the bed and said: "A-jian's mom, this palm bed is so dented, I have to call someone to repair it tomorrow. Old Wang bought an old palm bed, which is calculated by the foot!"

Mrs. Huang was patching a shirt. She looked up at the gray-black corner of the wall where rats often rolled up and down and sighed. Holes, a bottomless pit!

### Sailing in the Same Boat

— He Jia Zhi

(6) In a Flash

Until evening, Cui Zhen had a good chat with Wei Cheng. Wei Cheng asked about the size of Guo Fang's house. Cui Zhen said: "The house is quite good, but it's not the Chen family's own house, it's rented." Wei Cheng said: "In Shanghai, only a few people own property, most people live in rented houses, which has led to the system of second landlords, which is naturally incomparable to the countryside. Are they two stories or three stories?" Cui Zhen said: "I don't know about that. There is a courtyard when you enter, with wing rooms on both sides and a hall in the middle. There is a floor, they say it's fake, but it doesn't look fake at all. How can people live in a fake building?" Wei Cheng said: "A fake three-story building is a term for a remodeled two-story building. So where is Guo Fang's room?" Cui Zhen said, "She lives on the third floor, in two rooms inside and out. I saw that there were several empty rooms on the second floor and asked her why she didn't live there, to avoid walking up another flight of stairs. In a year, she would avoid walking quite a lot. She said: I hide alone upstairs so I can see less of my family. Cheng-di, do you think Miss Chen's words are strange?" Wei Cheng said: "I know that she and her aunt don't get along very well. Have you met her aunt since you've been living in her house?" Cui Zhen said: "I've met her and her father once, and her aunt twice. Her aunt is very young and plays mahjong two out of three days. Her aunt doesn't care about Miss Chen's affairs at all." Wei Cheng said: "Originally, in a big family, meanness, filth, confusion, and muddleheadedness are common occurrences. Guo Fang's family can't be said to be a big family, but it's a fact that they can't melt family emotions into a group and make them a piece. You've lived there for a few days, you can see that. Does she have any female classmates or girlfriends visiting her at home?" Cui Zhen: "When we went, it was Miss Chen, her brother, and me who went together. Later, her brother went back to school. In the middle, several people came to see Miss Chen, all about the same age as her. When her friends came, I was afraid, unlike at Cheng-di's house, where I knew all the guests who came. I didn't know them, and they were all dressed like brides. Because of this, I often felt uneasy." (106)

### The Night Before Rationing by Mouth

— Wen Chao

Before breakfast, Mr. Hu flipped through the newspaper as usual and said to Mrs. Hu happily, "The department has stipulated the method of rationing by mouth. We don't have to buy rice next month!"

"Oh! Did they distribute the household rice?" Mrs. Hu had heard about the rationing by mouth a long time ago, but had been hoping for it for a long time and hadn't seen it implemented. These days, everyone was talking about it, so it seemed that there was progress.

She went to the street to buy vegetables and met Mrs. Mao on the way home. They talked about the rising prices of vegetables and then switched to the issue of household rice.

"No, no, they say each person can only receive three sheng of rice a week. How can my family, who are all big eaters, be able to eat that?" Mrs. Mao said.

"That's not necessarily true. Mr. Hu said that the newspaper once reported that each person has eight he of rice a day, which is also two dou and four sheng a month." Mrs. Hu didn't believe her.

"Two dou and four sheng, that's enough to eat. Some people even advised me to buy more rice these days, so I can make up for it in the future if there's not enough, but I can't because my family doesn't have much money!"

"Don't worry. Our Mr. Hu said that distributing household rice is the fairest, unlike buying rice, where those with strength can buy a few more sheng, and those with little strength can't get even one sheng."

"Buying rice is really hard! And it's getting hot again, I can't stand it!" Mrs. Mao heard what Mrs. Hu said so logically and believed her.

In the afternoon, the landlady chatted with Mrs. Hu in her room, of course, it was the same old story, always including the cost of living and rice.

"Being a landlord is really unlucky. We have to take care of getting the rice coupons. If the tenants owe rent, we can't offend them. But if we are one day late in paying the donation fee, we won't get the rice coupons, and then we'll be forced to death by the tenants." The landlady complained about her hardships like reciting scriptures.

Mrs. Hu felt very happy when she heard it, thinking to herself, "If you don't get to this point, you won't reduce your prestige:"

"It's a pleasure to do things for good tenants like Mrs. Hu, like:" The landlady smiled unnaturally and pointed to the front wing room. She hated Mr. Zhu the most, who had refused several requests to increase the rent.

As soon as she sent the landlady to the stairway, she heard the "White-Collar Wife" from the pavilion talking to someone about the household rice.

"Getting rice once a week will cost seventy or eighty yuan. My husband spends his wages at the end of the month in half a month. If he can't get the money to get the rice by then, it's over…"

Mrs. Hu felt that her situation was similar to hers, and this was also a difficult problem. When buying rice on weekdays, when she had no money, she could pawn a few clothes, which would be enough to buy a day or two of rice. Fortunately, there are three days a week when rice is sold.

In the evening, Mrs. Hu went to bed early because tomorrow was another day for selling rice, and she had to go out in the middle of the night to queue up.

"In a few days, we won't have to suffer this anymore!" Mr. Hu comforted her.

"Then your responsibility is even greater. When it's time to get the rice, you have to prepare enough money!"
