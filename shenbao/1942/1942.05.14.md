### The Soviet Union Prepares to Confront a "European War" on All Fronts, Mobilizing Up to Six Million Troops; German-Russian Offensive Towards the Caucasus Possible

London, 13th (Reuters) – The most important news is the German army's offensive in the eastern Crimean Kerch Peninsula. Although its nature and objective are local, its scale is larger than the winter's repeated battles. The German army is using about several divisions, covered by a large number of tanks and aircraft. Official war reports are vague. According to private messages received from London, Soviet troops are still able to hold their ground, with only a slight retreat in the north. Military observers in the Romanian capital believe that the current German offensive seems to be a prelude to the spring general offensive. In the Donets Basin north of Kerch, troop movements have been frequent recently. Comparing this to the current German offensive, it can be seen that the German High Command may launch a large-scale offensive against the Caucasus in the near future. However, London military circles say that the German spring general offensive may be launched between the 18th and 23rd of this month due to timing. The Soviet Union is said to have made preparations on all fronts to deal with this "European War." The troops used in this battle will reach six million. Germany is said to have 24 tank divisions, a total of 5,000 tanks (reportedly, half of them have been concentrated on the southern route in preparation for an attack on the Caucasus), and 2,400 aircraft. The concentrated forces are estimated to be between 400,000 and 500,000, including 15 Romanian divisions, 12 Finnish divisions, 3 Italian divisions, 2 Hungarian divisions, 1 Slovak division, 1 Spanish volunteer division, and 1 Franco-Belgian mixed volunteer division. German military supplies have been transported to the three major supply stations of Smolensk, Vitebsk, and Kyiv.

Moscow, 13th – The Soviet war report stated that on the 12th, our army engaged in fierce fighting on the Kerch Peninsula. There were no major changes on other fronts. 42 German aircraft were destroyed on the 11th, and we lost 15. According to confirmed information, 60 German aircraft were destroyed on May 10th.

Headquarters of the German Leader, 13th (Haitong News Agency) – This year's German war report states that the battle to break through the isthmus of Kerch has now been decided. The enemy has been surrounded by our army and will soon be annihilated. To date, over 40,000 enemy soldiers have been captured, and 197 armored vehicles, 598 artillery pieces, and 269 aircraft have been lost. A large amount of military supplies have also been seized. German troops are currently pursuing the remnants of the enemy forces. Yesterday, our air force sank several enemy transport ships and other vessels in the territorial waters.

Berlin, 13th (Haitong News Agency) – The German High Command announced that the great battle of the Kerch Isthmus has come to an end. The surrounded enemy forces have been annihilated. Over 10,000 enemy soldiers have been captured, 197 armored vehicles have been lost, 598 artillery pieces have been lost, and 260 aircraft have been destroyed. The loss of military equipment and supplies is incalculable. The fleeing enemy is being pursued. In short, the German plan to break through the Kerch Isthmus has been successfully completed.

### Major Battle Underway on the Kerch Peninsula; Heavy Losses on Both Sides

London, 13th (Reuters) – Hitler's headquarters announced today that German forces have annihilated the Soviet garrison on the Kerch Peninsula. Other reports indicate that the advancing Axis forces are engaged in a major battle with Soviet troops under General Kozlov. The Soviet forces that recovered the peninsula last December were under Kozlov. The New York Times' dispatch from Moscow today stated that strong German forces, assisted by tanks and aircraft, appear to have launched four or five attacks from Taganrog westwards, northward to Kitayleno and Petropavlovka, turning west to the line of Dnepropetrovsk. However, progress has only been made near Petropavlovka, where Soviet troops have retreated three miles. Losses on both sides are heavy. Today's Soviet midday communiqué still stated that "nothing of importance occurred on the front line last night." Its supplementary communiqué stated that there was slight activity on the southern and northwestern fronts, but did not mention the Crimean battle. According to Moscow Radio, heavy fighting took place on the Kerch Peninsula throughout yesterday and is still ongoing. It is generally believed that both sides have sent large forces to fight, with the Germans concentrating large groups of cavalry, tanks, and infantry, including Romanian and Italian troops. Moscow has expressed confidence that the Red Army will defeat the German attempt to approach the Caucasus.

Berlin, 13th (Havas) – Military sources here say that the Kerch area battle should not be considered the beginning of the German spring offensive. The scope of the battle is limited, and the objectives have been determined early on. In other words, the Germans intend to gain an advantage there in order to launch a larger offensive. However, the battle is still extremely important, because once the Germans are victorious, the Red Army will lose a strategically important "springboard area" and will be unable to use it to counterattack and recover Crimea. As a result, the Red Army's fortifications in the area and the area's natural barriers will all fall into German hands. The term "springboard" is not new. It refers to any narrow position with dense air defense equipment and the ability to quickly concentrate other troops in areas near the enemy. Although the Red Army has a large number of troops, Germany and its allies pride themselves on their well-trained and well-equipped troops. The Germans will also fully utilize new weapons. In short, the current war effort has been prepared for a long time and is therefore not comparable to ordinary conflicts.

Berlin, 12th (Havas) – The "German General Report" published an article today commenting on the Eastern Front, stating, "We expect the Red Army defending the Kerch front to resist stubbornly, because the enemy has made full use of the winter to consolidate its positions, has already concentrated reserve forces, resulting in a large number of troops, and the Red Army there is assisted by the Soviet Black Sea Fleet, with transportation routes as smooth as ever. Under these circumstances, we must prepare for a determined battle."

### Rumors of German Vanguard Reaching the Shores of the Sea of Azov; New Weapons Used in the Attack on Kerch

Bucharest, Romania, 13th (Havas) – After three days of artillery and air battles, the German forces on the Kerch Peninsula front launched a large-scale offensive on the night of the 10th. That evening, German and Romanian combined engineering and infantry units, riding on steel-plated boats towed by fast steamships, landed behind Soviet lines. Although the Soviet army resisted desperately, it had no choice but to retreat due to the lack of artillery. That night, the German army built a bridgehead in the narrow area between the Black Sea and Lake Uzunlar. The next night, the German army continued to land on both sides of the bridgehead, and the Soviet army urgently transferred large reinforcements, and fierce battles resumed. By the morning of the 12th, the German army had reached the outskirts of Maryenka. At the same time, the German offensive towards the Arabat Spit also broke through the Soviet lines. In addition, with the help of dive bombers, the German and Romanian allied forces attacked the Soviet army in Zoya. The Soviet line was also breached within a few hours. On the night of the 12th, the German army launched a full-scale offensive, making contact with the German landing forces south of Lake Uzunlar. That night, the German vanguard reached the city of Maryenka and continued to advance north. At dawn today, they had reached the shores of the Sea of Azov, only a few miles from the port of Mayak. The Soviet forces in front were surrounded between Balbachik and the Arabat Spit, cutting off their retreat. The surrounded Soviet forces numbered only three divisions, equipped with excellent tanks.

Bucharest, Romania, 12th (Havas) – Official announcement: The advance troops of the German-Romanian allied forces have surrounded three divisions of the Red Army on the Kerch Peninsula and are now operating according to plan.

Bucharest, Romania, 12th (Havas) – Military sources said that the German army used some new weapons in the sudden attack on the Kerch area, which greatly surprised the Red Army soldiers. The Germans are satisfied with the results of using the new weapons, which have proven to be very effective in destroying the enemy's solid fortifications and can destroy the positions that prevent the advance of tanks. The purpose of this offensive is to occupy important strongholds in order to advance directly towards the Caucasus.

Bucharest, Romania, 12th (Havas) – Well-informed sources said that a major battle has now broken out on the Kerch Peninsula, but the scope of the battle is still unknown. However, this war can be regarded as the prelude to the German offensive against the Caucasus. Previously, the German army planned to advance towards the Volga River, attempting to isolate the Red Army defending the Caucasus and cut off contact with the Rostov-Astrakhan line. But at this point, the plan has been changed, and a "pincer strategy" is to be adopted, attacking the Caucasus from Crimea and Rostov. However, fighting on the Kerch Peninsula is very difficult and will take at least ten days to end. Therefore, this action will not materialize for a while. In addition, the Soviet Union has concentrated seven Red Army divisions in the Kerch area, all with the assistance of tanks, and its strength is sufficient and cannot be underestimated. Although the German air force has an advantage, the Red Army has good anti-aircraft artillery and a large number of fighter planes. The strength of both sides is evenly matched, so it is particularly difficult to determine the winner.

### Soviet Attack Southeast of Lake Ilmen

Berlin, 11th (Havas) – Official announcement: Yesterday, under the cover of aircraft and artillery, the Red Army launched a fierce attack on our positions southeast of Lake Ilmen. The battle lasted all day, and the Red Army was finally repelled. Our air force assisted the army in combat and was very successful, destroying many Soviet tanks and bombing enemy supply lines and troop concentration points behind the Red Army lines, destroying 50 trucks and damaging roads, making them impassable for vehicles.

### The US Government is Studying the Military Developments in the Soviet Territory

Washington, 11th (Havas) – According to a Berlin dispatch, Romanian troops are now assisting the German army in attacking the Soviet Union in the Crimean Peninsula. When Secretary of State Hull received reporters today, a reporter asked about this. Hull replied that the US government is currently studying the military developments in the Soviet Union and is closely watching the situation in the Balkans. At this point, Hull reiterated the statement previously made by Under Secretary of State Welles, stating that if Romania, Hungary, and Bulgaria continue to assist Germany, the United States will not hesitate to declare war on those countries.

### International Briefs

### French and American Representatives Continue Negotiations; Pétain Hastens Back to Vichy; Rumored Decision on the Matter

Washington, 13th (Havas) – The negotiations between France and the United States on the issue of Martinique in the West Indies are still continuing in a good atmosphere. According to American sources, significant progress has been made after recent meetings between Admiral Robert, the French High Commissioner for the West Indies, and General Hoover, the American representative. At the same time, Marshal Pétain's hasty return to Vichy from the countryside is also being taken seriously here, as the French leader's actions can be seen as a sign that the French government leaders are about to make a decision on these negotiations. However, the US believes that since the French headquarters are far away from this territory and transportation is difficult, it would be more convenient for the local authorities to directly exchange opinions with the United States. The United States has always considered this view as policy, and it has recently been explained by Secretary of State Hull. In essence, the relationship between the United States and the various French territories will be based on the principle of local negotiations. The reason is that the US government aims to facilitate bilateral negotiations and has no intention of denying French sovereignty over Martinique.

Washington, 12th (Havas) – Secretary of State Hull refused to make any statement on the issue of Martinique when he received reporters today, only saying, "The negotiations between General Hoover and Admiral Robert, the governor of French Martinique, are still ongoing. I have nothing to announce at this time."

### French Air Force Suffers Heavy Losses

Vichy, 13th (Haitong News Agency)

The French Ministry of Aviation revealed that the French Air Force suffered heavy losses while defending Diego Suarez (an important naval base) in Madagascar. French aircraft were completely destroyed, and the names of the fifteen French pilots who died for the country were all disclosed.

Vichy, 13th (Haitong News Agency) – The secretary of the new French government leader, former French Minister of Colonies Platon, issued a statement to the French in Madagascar, stating that the British military operation in Madagascar does not claim to protect the interests of the French people, nor does it use traitors to achieve its aim of seizing French territories, but uses genuine British troops to occupy Madagascar. The excuses made by the British in the past actions against Dakar, Saint Pierre, and Miquelon are a thing of the past. This time, the British have revealed their true colors. Fellow Frenchmen residing in Madagascar, you can now understand the British strategy. Historical evidence proves that the British only take risks where there is no danger. France is deeply impressed by the heroic operations of its colonial land, sea, and air forces. Our compatriots fighting in Madagascar have not only demonstrated France's determination to defend its territories with blood but also to maintain the sovereignty of the great French colonial empire.

### US Senate Passes Bill to Establish Women's Auxiliary Corps Attached to the Army; Auxiliary Corps for the Air Force Already Passed by the House

Washington, 12th (Havas) – The Senate today passed the bill to establish a "Women's Auxiliary Corps" attached to the US Army by a vote of 38 to 27. The bill states that the Women's Auxiliary Corps is not part of the regular army and that women aged 20 and over may join the service, but the number is limited to 150,000, to perform various tasks to free up men for combat units. In addition, the Air Force also plans to add a Women's Auxiliary Corps. This bill has been supported by the War Department and passed by the House of Representatives. The Senate also studied it today. However, the amendment proposed by Senator Maloney, which stipulated that the Women's Auxiliary Corps could only serve within the United States, was rejected by the Senate.

Lisbon, 13th (Haitong News Agency) – According to news here last night, the American people are closely watching the outcome of yesterday's Senate meeting, which decided whether to establish a women's auxiliary corps in the Air Force. The House of Representatives has already passed a resolution to establish a women's auxiliary corps, so the bill has been submitted to the Senate for approval. The members of the Women's Auxiliary Corps are engaged in driving cars and trucks, operating telegraphs and telephones, and medical affairs. The United States is also following the example of Germany by establishing agricultural courses in schools to enable students to automatically go to the countryside to work during the holidays. Male students work in the fields, and female students help farm women manage housework. In Chicago, 60 male and female students have volunteered for this work, and in New York, 13,000 middle school students are willing to participate. The number of female workers in American armament factories is increasing daily. The Midwest of the United States announced yesterday that it would replace half of the workers in ammunition factories with female workers.

### Japanese and British Exchange of Diplomats; Argentine Ship Leaves US for Africa

### Alaska Highway (5)

Since March of last year, the housewives have also done a very significant job for the country, which is to donate all the aluminum utensils they no longer need at home to the country. This is the most needed raw material for manufacturing Flying Fortresses and the like, and it is a good deed that is beneficial without being costly for the housewives. Last year's magazines and newspapers often published photos and statistical reports of the results of this type of campaign. The statistics for this now are probably hard to describe with numbers.

As for how farmers, workers, students, etc. are mobilized, there are many records, so we don't need to nag about it. Even the unemployed people are now almost all placed in batches by the unemployment organizations. These are all complicated and trivial tasks, and they also require considerable time to arrange.

However, new situations have been emerging constantly in recent months, and the difficulty of transportation has been increasing as a result. For example, American ships used to be able to go directly to Vladivostok, but now they can't, so they have to detour through India and transfer through the Near East to their destination. Recently, even India is not very convenient, so what should we do?

Several months ago, the Americans had already seen this point, so there was a plan to build the Alaska Highway. But there is always one point that we must understand, that is, the focus of this so-called World War is not in the Pacific, but in the Atlantic and Europe. Regardless of whether the reader agrees with this proposition or not, the British and American military and political circles are indeed arranging and implementing it in this way. Therefore, the construction of the Alaska Highway is more like opening up a new path for transportation to the Soviet Union than a strategic relationship. However, the most subtle point is that the Americans' focus is on the Aleutian Islands directly reaching Kamchatka, and not on the Bering Strait. This is a point worth pondering.

In order to explain the Alaska Highway, we mentioned why the Americans only thought of building the highway at this time; in order to explain this problem, we have involved everything else about the United States. This seems to have dragged the reader around in a big circle for no reason; we are very sorry. Now let's talk a little about the origins of this highway.

This highway is more of a historical material of modern times than a matter of the current situation. Originally, in February 1941, after a meeting between the British and American authorities, it was decided to extend the Canadian air route. How long to extend it? To the west coast of Alaska, and if possible, directly to the Soviet Union along Siberia.

The starting points of this air route are London in England and Washington in the United States. The intersection of these two points is on the island of Newfoundland mentioned in the previous article. From Newfoundland to Quebec, according to aviation, it is only a glance away, only ten minutes of flight. From Quebec to Winnipeg and then to Edmonton, that is a long distance; then from Edmonton to Fort Nelson, and then to Watson Lake. If you go further west, that is Fairbanks, the center of Alaska.

However, with the airline, you have to build a highway along the line. From Quebec to Edmonton, there is already a transcontinental railway, so there is no need to bother at all. From Edmonton to Fort Nelson, there are also possible transportation highways, waterways, etc. But from here to the west and north, to put it in literary terms, it is "ice and snow cover the ground, boundless at a glance."

Since the air route proposal was decided, the US Department of Transportation entrusted this project to the Western Construction Company of Edmonton and the General Construction Company of Vancouver; one built the Fort Nelson airfield, and the other built the Watson Lake airfield. The two companies cooperated on the highway. The hard thing is that these two sections are 300 miles away from the nearest railway station. Fortunately, once the war is over, it will be a time of peace in the world; in these peaceful days, this air route and highway can be of great use, so the United States does not hesitate to sacrifice a large amount of manpower and material resources to carry out the project.

Speaking of the way of road construction, it is extremely difficult. If you don't grit your teeth and do it, you really can't do it. Before construction starts, a team of sleds and snowmobiles must be sent to clear the forest and ice and snow. The forest is fine; only the solid ice, according to geologists, is accumulated ice from the Great Ice Age tens of thousands of years ago. Just building dozens of feet of runway at Fort Nelson cost 18,000 gold dollars. It is conceivable how large a number the cost of the entire road is.

When you get to Fairbanks, the center of Alaska, this line is divided into south, north, and west routes. The most important thing is the one that goes south through Anchorage to Kodiak Island. Because from here directly west, you can fly to Dutch Harbor, the main point of the Aleutian Islands; further west is the tail of these islands, a small island called Attu. It is said that this is a secret place: from here to Kamchatka, it is only 200 miles; and from here to Fusang (Japan), it is only a little less than 1,000 miles.

If you are only talking about transportation, it is most convenient to go directly from Fairbanks to Nome; because Nome is an existing port: from here you can board a ship and go directly to Siberia. And there is also St. Lawrence Island in the middle, where you can dock for a short break. But in terms of both transportation and marching, it is of course better to seek the near and abandon the far.

### Border between Soviet Union and America

The small island in the picture is the border between Alaska and Siberia. The island is named Diomedes, which is in the middle of the Bering Strait between the Soviet Union and the United States, only 55 miles away.

### Rice Shops Exchange Flat Rice with Small Bills; Hoarding of Small Bills is Inappropriate; Banking Sector Seeks to Eliminate Panic of Small Bills

According to the English-language Da Mei Evening News, according to news this morning (13th), the responsible authority in the banking sector is currently formulating effective measures to ease the acute monetary situation caused by the shortage of small bills and to eliminate the troubles encountered by the public when purchasing retail items. It is heard that there are two measures to be taken: one is to add one-dollar banknotes, and the other is for the government to come forward to prohibit individuals and stores from hoarding small bills. Qualified people believe that the current shortage of small bills is because most rice shops in the city exchange flat rice and refuse to use the small bills they receive. There are thousands of rice shops squeezing to purchase flat rice, all of which require small bills. This is the biggest factor affecting the current monetary situation. It is expected that the government will take action on this, and the situation should ease at that time. The current situation can be compared to the use of stamps to replace small change a few years ago. Later, when the authorities decided to add small change notes, the situation quickly improved.

### Restaurant Owner's Child Kidnapped; Negotiation at Designated Place, Police and Bandits Fight; One Criminal Captured, Others Escaped

A Western restaurant on Bei'du'ao Road, Xiafei Road, French Concession, is opened by a Shandong man named Song. Song has a son, seven years old. He disappeared suddenly a week ago while playing with a group of children in front of the restaurant. Song asked everywhere, but there was no news. Unexpectedly, after the child disappeared, Song received two threatening letters, demanding a ransom of 50,000 French francs and asking him to send someone to negotiate near the barbed wire on Columbia Road, Shanghai West, at 2 pm on the 13th. Song immediately reported to the police station. At 1 pm yesterday, he sent detectives disguised to wait there. As expected, three kidnappers came. When the detectives were about to step forward to negotiate, they were discovered by the bandits as disguised detectives. They turned around and tried to escape. The detectives immediately drew their guns and fired at the three kidnappers. The bandits also drew their guns and returned fire. The two sides exchanged more than twenty shots. As a result, one bandit was arrested and a pistol was found. The other two bandits escaped without a trace. At that time, there were few pedestrians on the road, so fortunately no one was injured. It is still unknown where the hostage is hidden. The police station is investigating and rescuing him.

### A Certain Society Generously Distributes Sawing Funds; Benefits the Poor Scholars

Our newspaper received a letter yesterday from a certain society, stating that it generously transferred part of the income from its base surplus item and proposed 8,000 yuan to be allocated to our newspaper's reader scholarship fund. The benevolent actions are admirable. The society also gave detailed insights, instructing that this scholarship donation should be given priority to the children of teachers and news practitioners who are unable to afford to study. This shows the society's sincere sympathy for cultural workers. In the past, the newspaper's scholarship fund committee has been sponsored and supervised by all sectors of society for scholarship applications from all walks of life, striving to be fair and impartial. In the future, it will follow the established rules to make scholarship work more widespread. Since the society has given special reminders, the donation will be used to give priority to the poor children of teachers and news practitioners in accordance with the regulations, in order to live up to the society's kindness. Yesterday, the scholarship fund received 8,000 yuan from a certain society, 5 yuan from an anonymous person (receipt number 288), and 1 yuan from He Shou, totaling 8,006 yuan. The previous savings were 47,094 yuan and 53 cents, totaling 55,100 yuan and 53 cents.

### Organizing a Water Security System; Plan to Register Ships First

According to the English-language Times, the leader of the Public Concession Security System claimed that the security system has made great progress since it was launched in mid-February. Regarding the Shanghai River Ship Industry Association and the major Japanese shipping companies' request to organize a water security system, it is heard that the responsible authorities are investigating the current situation on the Huangpu River and Suzhou Creek in order to formulate a suitable water security system plan. However, everything on the Huangpu River and Suzhou Creek must be registered first. Only then can concrete steps be implemented.

It is expected that the number of subsequent issues will increase day by day, from 1,000 cards per day to 12,000 to 30,000 per day. This will take about two months to complete by mid-July. The citizen's cards in the French Concession and the Chinese areas will also be issued successively, but the period will be later, so the issuance of citizen's cards for all citizens in Shanghai will be completed in August.

### Puppet Show; First Performance Last Night

Datong News Agency reported, according to the English-language Da Mei Evening News, Shanghai's first-ever puppet company has been organized and its first performance was held last night at the Jewish General Association on Jing'an Temple Road. The performance was directed by Mr. Gottlin, a Westerner, and the Shanghai Puppet Theater Troupe was responsible for the performance. Mr. Gottlin was a film director in Berlin. He and the technical director, Irving Gottlin, spent several months researching and preparing for this puppet show. They made 15 puppets and a small stage by themselves. During the performance, some experts among the European Jewish refugees were responsible for pulling the strings and dialogue. There was a loudspeaker in the hall to transmit the voices, so that all the audience could hear them. The puppets they made were very delicate and flexible. Not only could they dance to the beat of the music, but their eyes could also open and close as needed, and their lips could also move like life when they spoke. Each puppet was about two feet high and could move freely on a two-yard-long stage. The plays performed by the company not only adopted European scripts, but also original new plays. The dialogues were either in English or German, or in Chinese or Japanese. The puppet troupe did not have a fixed theater and could be hired to perform at any time.

### Japanese Embassy Spokesman Talks About; Optimistic About the Future of People's Food; Japanese Authorities are Working Hard to Remedy the Situation

According to the English-language Da Mei Evening News, Kawasaki Torao, a spokesman for the Japanese Embassy, said at a press conference yesterday (12th) that the most serious problem Shanghai is currently facing is the issue of people's food supply. However, the Japanese authorities are now working hard to remedy this situation. Some people are optimistic about people's food, and some are pessimistic, depending on whether they have enough food themselves. It is undeniable that there are many people in this city who are taking advantage of the opportunity to make profits and engage in other illegal activities. However, the Japanese authorities are trying their best to solve this situation, so there is good reason to be optimistic about the future of this city.

### More Than 500,000 Foreign Exchange Stolen in the Past Two Weeks; Mostly Servants Stealing Valuable Items

According to the English-language Shanghai Times, in the past two weeks, valuable items such as cash, jewelry, and ornaments of foreigners in this city have been stolen by their servants, with a value of about more than 500,000 yuan. According to authoritative sources, most police stations in the two concessions have received reports from these foreigners, saying that the Amahs or cooks they hired stole certain valuable items and escaped without a trace. Currently, police stations have sent out a large number of detectives to search for the fleeing thieves. It is heard that in the cases reported by the police stations, 90% of the plaintiffs cannot report the address of the fleeing servants, and some even do not know the surnames of the servants. Therefore, it is not easy to detect these fugitives. Among the cases of this kind in the police stations, the amount stolen in a certain case reached 30,000 yuan, and in another case, jewelry worth 15,000 yuan was stolen. The occurrence of such cases mostly occurs when the foreign masters are out, especially on weekends. And after the theft, it took several weeks to be discovered, so the criminals were able to escape and hide in the four suburbs at ease, which made the detective work difficult.

### The New Municipal Council Organization to Solve All Problems (II) The Work of the General Purposes Committee Relates to Everyone

Ten Departments

There are a total of ten extraordinary departments under the jurisdiction of this committee. Each department focuses on and resolves problems arising within its own specific scope. However, these departments do not have the authority to implement their conclusions. They must submit them to the General Purposes Committee for thorough consideration to determine whether or not to approve them. The decisions of the General Purposes Committee are final.

In addition to the proposals submitted by the various departments, any member of the General Purposes Committee may propose any matter for discussion. This last point implicitly expands the scope of the meeting to an unlimited extent.

Rapid Resolution

This approach—that is, the method of a think tank holding full authority over other departments—greatly promotes the rapid resolution of matters. This approach allows an emergency committee to control the entire emergency system. Every matter must be under the committee's control. This simplifies things considerably and reduces delays.

Since the beginning of December, the General Purposes Committee has been active non-stop. It has completed a large amount of work and accumulated a great deal of merit. It is the guiding spirit behind the scenes, planning everything. It has created new departments when needed. Since last winter, it has made countless decisions. Every day at ten o'clock in the morning, these eight people sit together for meetings, and it has been five months. Every day at the same time, they will continue to meet as usual. Until... but no one can predict how long this emergency will last. Only one thing can be said with certainty: if the state of emergency continues to exist, the General Purposes Committee will continue to hold its meetings at ten o'clock every day, as usual...

II. The Warriors of Commodity Prices

Where do all the good residents of Shanghai go after they die? This is a topic that is still being debated. But at least one thing is beyond doubt: when they really die (which even Shanghai residents ultimately cannot avoid), three words, HCL, will definitely be found deeply engraved on their hardened hearts. It will never be anything else. Because HCL (the High Cost of Living) is the inescapable threat that accompanies every moment of our survival today. We are all fugitives under inflation; prey chased by hoarders; fish on the chopping block of monopolists. In our gray lives, there is only one hope. That hope is the Municipal Council's Commodity Price Control Committee.

The wretchedness of our situation often provokes some bitter sarcasm. When something happens, we casually grab it and vent our anger... and ninety-nine percent of the time, the target of our acidic humor is the long-suffering Municipal Council. "Why doesn't the Municipal Council do something about this?" we angrily point out. In our triumphant condemnation, we never take a moment to consider the real facts. In reality, if we had ever bothered to investigate, we would have been surprised to find that the Municipal Council is absolutely working hard to find a solution. The effort is far beyond what we can imagine.

Einstein Said

Einstein once said, "Sometimes a person pays to buy something that another person gets for nothing." This short warning only proves that Einstein never had the good fortune to visit Shanghai. In our little world today, a person no longer even hopes to get anything; he can only dream of paying extravagant amounts of money. But make no mistake, don't complain about this to the Municipal Council. If it weren't for them, things would be even worse. If you still want to ask what the Municipal Council is doing, then let me tell you, the Municipal Council is doing—as always—using all its strength.

### Paper Money Weak

In addition to the short-term change in single banknotes hoarding, the foreign currency market situation is as stable as ever. The former is still 500 yuan for British gold pounds, and the latter is still 510 yuan. US dollar notes are around 33 yuan. Hong Kong notes are still 5 yuan and 5 yuan 10 cents. Military notes opened at 7 yuan 38 cents in the morning, rose to 44 cents after opening, but then immediately fell, and finally closed at 7 yuan 26 cents, down 12 cents from the previous day.

The Shanghai Bankers' Association's interbank lending rate rose another 2 cents to 14 cents. The discount rate for cashier's checks is still 20 yuan and 25 yuan per thousand yuan. The premium for reserve notes is about 30 cents per yuan.

Single banknotes are still scarce, but changes may occur soon. The reason is that stores lack single banknotes for change and are forced to (A) secretly increase prices, (B) reduce the limit for single banknote exchange to the minimum. In this way, the demand for single banknotes is reduced in a subtle way. Furthermore, the scarcer the goods, the more they are collected, and when they collapse one day, they will feel abundant again. Picking new and rejecting old is like buying banknotes now. Thirdly, the stores that absorb the most single banknotes today are rice stores. Rice stores do not sell without single banknotes, but this cannot be generalized. Many rice stores will give change if they can, and if they cannot, they will also have ways to make do. However, most of them are as black-hearted as coal and will not sell without single banknotes. With single banknotes, you can buy two sheng, which is nothing more than exploitation. Now citizens need single banknotes, one is for buying rice, and the other is for buying vegetables. If there is a solution for rice, then the way to collect single banknotes will be cut off. Nothing can win the hearts of the people more than changing the rice sale to 2.5 sheng for 6 yuan as a unit to reduce the use of single banknotes by two-thirds and allow the public to buy more rice. However, it is necessary to crack down on the "rice squeezing party", otherwise good people will not get rice, but bad people will get more rice and form gangs to squeeze, which is not a fair distribution method. Fourthly, many stores are using methods to make up for the shortage of single banknotes, such as substitute coupons, which will inevitably emerge one after another. This is also enough to curb the hoarding of single banknotes. Yesterday, single banknotes were bought in for 100 yuan for 78 yuan, and sold out for 112 yuan. Ruthless people are not included in this case.

### Spot Cash is Sold Everywhere

The spot cash market is hot and red, and the price has changed from rising to falling. The selling intention of cash houses and securities houses is still good. Although the trading volume is strong, the price fluctuations are still small. The opening price in the early morning was still 21,400 yuan, the same as the noon price of the previous day. Seeing securities houses buying in, the price immediately rose, and someone bought in 10 taels, rising to 21,650 yuan. Cash houses rushed to sell everywhere, and securities houses suddenly came and sold again. The price gradually lowered, and the silver houses also sold out. The lowest price was 21,300 yuan. Someone bought in. The final trading price at noon was 21,350 yuan, 50 yuan less than the previous day, with a difference of 350 yuan. The final price was 21,300 yuan, with only selling households and no buying households.

The price of gold ornaments in silver shops is still 2,250 yuan per tael (200 yuan less for buying in) in all major new stores. The price of silver ingots is 18 yuan, and the black market price is 15.89 yuan, which has rebounded. The price of a silver coin is still 9.5 yuan.

### Buyers Are Buying Government Bonds, The More the Better, There Must Be Other Special Ways to Go

In the gray market for government bonds, the market fluctuated even more yesterday. The sellers were still very enthusiastic, but the absorption capacity of the buyers was also very strong. Spot goods, "hundreds of thousands sold out, unexpectedly failed to push the market price down, but instead tended to rise. This kind of strength competition is really admirable. The macro food intake of the multiple parties and the speed of consumption, the gray market, has never had such a huge situation before. For example, yesterday the large households sold out, and two families had a spectrum of 1.5 million, and other families followed suit, also having 450,000. They were all absorbed by multiple parties, and several companies only received and did not sell. Its strength can be imagined. Since the previous selling, it is estimated that there have been more than 30 million, with a total of 1 million taels of silver. No matter the strength in the same industry, it is not enough to talk about this. Even the smaller financial sector cannot be undertaken by one or two companies. It is expected that in addition to a part being absorbed by strength, most of them have other special ways to go, which cannot be viewed from the bottom of the well. Yesterday, Tongli continued to sell, and the number was no less than the previous day. Wuhua, Xie Kang, and Hongxing also sold more than 300,000, and Tongkang, Yuanhe, Tongshun, and Hongda also sold quite a bit. The market price was slightly lower for a while, and then immediately rose. Shunli bought more than 300,000, and Hu Heji, Xinji, Chengkang, Xinhua, Zhongfu, Jiufeng, Yongchang, Kai, Hengyu, Lianhe, Lianyi, Gongmao, Tongyuan, etc. were all buying in one after another. Retail investors' buying and selling were not counted. 1.5 million spot goods flowed out. As a result, except for type C which was slightly lower by 20 cents, the rest rose by 40 cents to 70 cents. The transaction volume was about 2 million yuan. The following is a brief table.

### Hua Shares Continue to Make Progress, Foreign Shares Rise and Fall Indefinitely

### Sail Shadow

— Lei Ruohua

Opening my eyes, I felt a chill. Turning over, my hand resting on the bed, I thought to add a blanket: Huh, my hand touched something so damp. Through the boundless darkness, I stared to see what it was, but I couldn't see anything. I just knew I wasn't sleeping on the bed anymore. My hand was covered in damp sand. I looked up, sparse stars adorning the sky, blinking, perhaps mocking me for dreaming: You still have a bed there, you still have a house there, you still have a home there, but you've come to this...

Really, where have I come to? Is it the human world or...?

I thought I heard something. Yes, it was nearby, a surging, roaring sound. Was it the sea? Have I come to a beautiful seaside? Ah, I'm so happy I could jump up. But I still didn't dare to move. I would wait for the dawn.

Have I acquired some kind of magic? Look, it's really bright.

However, it wasn't a beautiful seaside. It was an island. No houses, no trees, no seabirds. The terrifying roar of the raging waves was my only companion. I thought I had fallen into a fate more pathetic than Robinson Crusoe.

The sounds of the human world were completely cut off. How would I accept these lonely days?

The waves calmed. I stood on the beach, my eyes gazing into the distance, searching for a sail shadow. Only those who live on isolated islands truly understand the preciousness of a sail shadow.

Oh no, a giant wave was coming, coming so suddenly. It swept me into the sea. I swam desperately, but I was getting farther and farther from the shore. I was exhausted. I let the sea toss me about.

I closed my eyes, but my eyes opened again. The room was dark and silent, and there was the sound of drizzling rain outside. I felt a little tired and listless.

### Untitled (Self-Mockery)

— Lei Kaqian

It was the day the world was returned to its creator. The representative of humanity knelt dejectedly before him, admitting the absurdity and incompetence of his race.

The Creator, however, raised his head, and a contemptuous and cold laugh echoed in the vast expanse of space.

Laughing for a long time, the somber laughter announced its cessation: the entire universe then fell silent, and the so-called "world civilization" created by the presumptuous human race was gradually submerged by the reappearing primitive landscape.

The world then returned to the primitive era.

So the Creator called the ox, who had toiled for humanity for many years but had still failed to be valued by humanity, to come and take on the mission of building the world.

"It is not as lazy as a pig, nor as cunning as a fox, and even less arrogant, greedy, and selfish as a human." The Creator thought secretly in his heart, "Perhaps it will not mess up the world."

From then on, the ox was made the "spirit of all things." And what about humans? That was up to the ox's pleasure, to decide what "categories," "classes," "species," and "races" they belonged to.

### The Joey That Freely Enters and Exits the Pouch

Australia's kangaroos are world-renowned. The following joke, though a bit over the top, is nonetheless refreshing.

It is said that an Irish countrywoman once went to Dublin to buy some things that she couldn't find in the countryside. Before she set off, someone told her that after arriving in Dublin, she didn't have to go anywhere else, but she had to visit the zoo. And in the zoo, she didn't have to see anything else, but the elephant and the lion were a must-see, because they were rare things to see.

She "followed good advice" and went to the zoo for a visit. She walked in front of a cage and saw a strange animal with a long tail and its front paws tucked in front of its chest. She was indeed seeing something she had never seen before and asked the warden:

"Is that a Kangaroo, an indigenous Australian?" he replied.

As soon as the woman heard this, she continued, "Oh my goodness, my daughter is married to one of them!"

This kind of joke only describes the countrywoman who is ignorant and straightforward. As for the kangaroo's personality, it is very unique. As soon as the kangaroo leaves the womb, it naturally crawls into the mother kangaroo's pouch. There, the joey, with its mouth on the nipple, squats motionless inside.

Two months later, the joey no longer nurses often. In the wilderness, it jumps out of the pouch and the mother kangaroo feeds it plants and the like.

The joey jumps out of the pouch very easily, and it is not difficult to jump back in. However, after six months, because its body gradually grows larger, the mother kangaroo gradually finds it unbearable to bear the burden. She no longer allows the joey to enter and exit freely.

When the joey is startled, it desperately dives into the pouch, head first, with its long tail and hind legs exposed outside. Only when the shock has subsided does it turn around in the pouch, retract its hind legs and tail inside, and stretch its head out of the pouch to observe the outside world.

From a character standpoint, the mother kangaroo is not a completely "good mother," because when she encounters an emergency, she often drags the "little treasure" out of the pouch and then runs away.

The original meaning of the word Kangaroo, in Australian terms, means "what does that mean". When the Cook expedition first arrived in Australia, they saw this animal and went to ask the natives. Because the natives did not understand what they meant, they answered with the word "kangaroo". Due to a misunderstanding, it became the name of the kangaroo. This can also be said to be a joke.

### Elevated Machine Gun

— Yongyun

In order to counter fighter planes strafing soldiers in the trenches, someone invented an elevated machine gun. The machine gun is supported by a tripod, just like a camera. The range of the elevated machine gun is also farther than that of ordinary machine guns, and it can arbitrarily sweep the sky in all directions.

### Proverbs of the Malagasy People

— Zhengzheng

The Malagasy people are a nation that likes to use proverbs. Some proverbs have been passed down from primitive societies, and some are similar to those of Europeans and Asians, but most of them contain profound meanings. The following are a few selected:

Marriage is not a dead knot, but a living knot.

The end of a cow is steak; the end of a lie is exposure.

If you don't wash your hands, you will be said to be dirty; if you wash your hands, you will be said to use too much water.

May your friendship be like the mouth and the hand; when the hand hurts, use the mouth to blow it, and when the mouth hurts, use the hand to rub it.

Before swallowing the food in your mouth, don't start the second bite.

(5) Repaying Kindness

Wei Cheng had never seen Cui Zhen act like this before, so he asked, "Sister Cui Zhen, what's the matter?" Cui Zhen glanced back at the oyster-shell windowpane, checking if anyone was outside, then looked at Wei Cheng and smiled, "I wanted to borrow some money from Brother Cheng. My uncle has already often troubled Brother Cheng, and now it's my turn, I really can't bring myself to ask." Wei Cheng never expected Cui Zhen to say this. After she said it, he actually felt relieved about everything. He didn't hesitate at all, afraid that if he hesitated, Sister Cui Zhen would think he was refusing. He said, "Of course, of course. Sister Cui Zhen is too kind, insisting on saying 'borrow'. Are you and I not family? How much do you need? Please tell me." Cui Zhen's face reddened and she said, "Brother Cheng, decide how much you think is appropriate." This sounded strange to Wei Cheng. Why should the person borrowing money have the lender decide the amount? He replied, "I don't know what Sister Cui Zhen needs it for, whether it's for pocket money or to buy fruit." Cui Zhen said, "Brother Cheng, please lend me ten dollars." Wei Cheng said, "Of course, of course. That's for pocket money." Wei Cheng immediately took out a five-dollar bill and five one-dollar bills from his pocket. He meant that if Cui Zhen needed pocket money, he should give her the smaller denominations. Cui Zhen took them, counted them, and also took out a square piece of yellow paper from her person, wrapped the bills in it, placed it on the table, and smiled, "Brother Cheng, please write 'Bian Cui Zhen' on it. This is my gift to my aunt to buy some tinfoil paper with."

At this point, Wei Cheng understood that Sister Cui Zhen wanted to borrow money to give a gift, so he said, "Sister Cui Zhen, why bother? The things you do for Shi De Tang, both responsible and hardworking, my mother already knows. Why do you still need to give a gift?" Wei Cheng wanted to tear off the yellow paper wrapping, but Cui Zhen wouldn't allow it. Four hands pressed down on the paper package. Cui Zhen said, "Brother Cheng, are you afraid I won't repay the money? I will repay it, unless my surname becomes Ye, then I won't give gifts. My surname is Bian now. Brother Cheng, you must let me give a gift. Please keep it a secret from my second aunt." Wei Cheng felt that Cui Zhen's reasons were strong and he couldn't refute her, so he took Cui Zhen's hands away, picked up a pen instead, and wrote the words "Respectfully Presented by Bian Cui Zhen" on the yellow paper package. He then took out the gift registry managed by the accountant, entered it in order, and smiled, "Sister Cui Zhen, I should thank you." (75)
