### Javanese Dutch East Indies Army Actively Resisting Japanese Advance: Resistance is Strong on Land, Sea and Air; Landing Japanese Forces Have Penetrated Forty Miles

Tokyo, 2nd (Domei News Agency dispatch) The Japanese Imperial General Headquarters announced at 12:20 PM today that large units of Japanese forces, under naval cover, landed on the eastern and western ends and central coast of Java Island yesterday at dawn and are expanding their gains. The enemy is resisting strongly on land, sea and air. As of now, on the Japanese side, one transport ship has been sunk, and three have run aground, but troop losses are minimal.

A Certain Japanese Base, 2nd (Domei News Agency dispatch) Japanese naval bombers flew over Java Island yesterday, launching the first attack on Christmas Island, 50 kilometers south of the island, a wireless station and Allied naval base. All planes returned safely.

Batavia (Havas News Agency dispatch) The Dutch East Indies General Headquarters has just released a war report stating that the Japanese army began its attack on Java last night, first landing in the northwest area northeast of XXX and XXX Bay, and then landing 30 miles east of XXX. A Dutch East Indies destroyer fought bravely outside Bandung Harbor and was eventually sunk by the Japanese. The Dutch East Indies Air Force also attacked the Japanese landing forces, but the outcome is still under investigation. The Dutch East Indies Army is currently trying to stop the Japanese advance in the northeast. However, because all important industrial facilities near Cirebon, especially the oil refineries, have been deliberately destroyed by the Dutch army, there is little hope of stopping the Japanese advance. In addition, the Dutch part of Timor Island has indeed been occupied by the Japanese army.

Batavia (Havas News Agency dispatch) The British Broadcasting Corporation has just issued a message stating that, according to sources in the Dutch East Indies, the Japanese army has occupied XX, XX miles from Batavia. However, fierce fighting is still ongoing at the Japanese landing site. Japanese light armored vehicles have successfully landed and are now cooperating with mountain vehicle teams in combat.

Tokyo, 1st (Domei News Agency dispatch) San Francisco wireless station reported tonight that Japanese forces landing on the north coast of Java, south of Anjungan, are advancing south along the main roads in a relatively flat area, having penetrated forty miles inland. Japanese forces landing at Rembang have penetrated sixteen miles along the road and railway leading to Surabaya.

Tokyo, 2nd (Domei News Agency dispatch) News from the Japanese front lines refutes foreign reports that the main Japanese force landed in Java last night. It is claimed that Japanese forces in western Java have already seized a key enemy position and subsequently occupied a key point on the railway. Japanese forces in central Java are advancing along the railway. The third Japanese force landing in eastern Java is pursuing defeated enemies who are setting fire to oil tanks. At the same time, there has been significant development in central Sumatra. Japanese forces on the island have penetrated the central area, attacking and capturing enemy forces at Sarolangun, 200 kilometers west of Palembang, and then occupying Moradewi, 80 kilometers northwest of that location.

Saigon, 2nd (Haitong News Agency dispatch) A telegram from Batavia states that the British Commander-in-Chief issued a proclamation today stating that British forces in Java have formed a defensive line to protect this last bastion of democracy in the southwestern Pacific. The battle is currently taking place along a 600-mile front along the northern coast of Java, from west of Batavia to east of Surabaya. Japanese forces have penetrated 35 miles inland. A Dutch East Indies government announcement today stated that detailed information about the progress of the war could not be released during this resistance against the Japanese forces.

British and Dutch Forces Fighting Shoulder to Shoulder

Bandung, 2nd (Reuters News Agency dispatch) British forces are now fighting alongside Dutch Allied forces in Java against the Japanese. The battle is currently taking place along the north coast and on the fertile plain approximately 35 miles inland. This plain stretches approximately 600 miles from west of Batavia to east of Surabaya. The orders given to the British forces before the battle stated roughly: "British forces in Java, we will be fighting alongside Dutch and American Allied forces to defend our last strong base in the southwestern Pacific. We are deeply honored. The Japanese are opponents who are superior in tactics and weaponry. The Japanese are likely superior in numbers. Japanese armored vehicles have penetrated as far as Subang, indicating that the Japanese force that landed near Anjungan has penetrated 35 miles from the coastline. Subang is located in the foothills that cross Java, forming an important defensive line. In the northern plains of Java, which include the important cities of Semarang, Cirebon, Surabaya, and Batavia, demolition teams and engineers are on standby to destroy port facilities, stockpiles, factories, bridges, roads, and railways, especially in areas where the defensive positions are weak or the Japanese are about to enter. Based on the number and heavy equipment of the landing Japanese forces, this attack is bound to be carried out on a truly "lightning" scale." At the same time, the Dutch East Indies Military Headquarters in Batavia announced today in a public statement that it is not appropriate to announce details of the developments at this stage of the campaign. The transport fleet sent out by the Japanese when attacking Java was extremely large, reaching XXX ships including escort ships. Under the cover of warships, the Japanese landed at three locations, and the Dutch East Indies army counterattacked. Allied aircraft are constantly attacking. Japanese aircraft are operating from bases in Sumatra, Bali, Borneo, and aircraft carriers. After landing, the Japanese forces penetrated inland using armored cars, motorcycles, and bicycles. The Dutch navy, outnumbered and suffering heavy losses, resisted fiercely. The Dutch fleet lost a major part in the area, and Allied naval reinforcements are not available, which is all in favor of the Japanese. Allied aircraft are also in urgent need of reinforcements.

Japanese Forces 60 Miles from Bandung

Bangkok, 2nd (Haitong News Agency dispatch) Yesterday's official gazette of the Dutch East Indies in Batavia stated that Japanese forces landing on Java Island on Saturday night at XX have penetrated deep into the interior of Java. The advance of the Japanese army is covered by armored vehicles and tanks landing at other locations. Currently, Japanese forces are only 60 kilometers from Bandung.

Stockholm, Sweden, 2nd (Haitong News Agency dispatch) London reported yesterday on the Japanese landing in Java, stating that these Japanese forces are elite Japanese troops, specially trained in naval and land warfare. At the time of the landing, aircraft flying from bases in Sumatra, Bali, Borneo, and aircraft carriers provided cover. At the time, a Dutch destroyer resisted the Japanese landing but was repelled by a Japanese cruiser. The Japanese then broke through their line and landed in the XX area west of Batavia. The area is flat, with clean roads, lined with rice paddies and cornfields, and has roads and railways connecting to Surabaya. Therefore, it is widely believed that the Japanese army will be able to advance rapidly in that area.

### Details of the Battle of the Java Sea Released

Tokyo, 2nd (Domei News Agency dispatch) The Japanese Imperial General Headquarters announced at 5:40 PM today that Japanese fleets pursuing the remaining units of the British-American-Dutch Allied fleet sank a British first-class cruiser and two other destroyers 30 miles east of Rembang, Java, at 11:00 AM yesterday.

Batavia, 2nd (Reuters News Agency dispatch) The naval authorities here announced last night the details of the Battle of the Java Sea, stating: "On the afternoon and evening of February 27, reconnaissance aircraft reported that a Japanese transport fleet, the main force of which consisted of over XX ships, was escorted by over XX warships, including several heavy cruisers, and was heading south from the north toward eastern Java. Our side immediately ordered a unit of the Allied fleet in eastern Java to intercept and delay their landing operation. In the evening of the same day, the two fleets engaged in fierce artillery fire at a distance of 20 kilometers and attacked each other with destroyers. At this point in the naval battle, only a cruiser on the Allied side suffered considerable damage and withdrew from the front line, and a destroyer was sunk. The battle continued into the night, and two Dutch cruisers approached Japanese ships to fight, both were hit and damaged, and they fought and sank. Because all of our ships received strict orders from the Commander-in-Chief of the Navy to fight the Japanese with all their strength, inflicting maximum losses before they landed in Java, our ships did not hesitate to sacrifice themselves for this cause. It is reported that two Dutch cruisers were sunk by torpedoes. These ships are thought to have entered the Japanese submarine line during the battle."

### British to Issue Statement on Indian Problem

London, 2nd (Reuters News Agency dispatch) British Prime Minister Churchill and his key colleagues are preparing a document on British government policy toward India. It is expected that the Prime Minister will read this document in the House of Commons soon. The Indian problem that the British government must address is quite complex.

### Wavell on Generalship (9)

Lincoln to General Hooker

I have placed you at the head of the Army of the Potomac. I have done this upon what appear to me to be sufficient reasons, and yet I think it best for you to know that there are some things in regard to which I am not quite satisfied with you. I believe you to be a brave and skillful soldier, which of course I like. I also believe you do not mix politics with your profession, in which you are right. You have confidence in yourself, which is a valuable, if not an indispensable quality. You are ambitious, which, within reasonable bounds, does good rather than harm. But I think that during Gen. Burnside's command of the Army, you have taken counsel of your ambition, and thwarted him as much as you could, in which you did a great wrong to the country and to a most deserving and honorable brother officer. I have heard, in such a way as to believe it, of your recently saying that both the Army and the Government needed a Dictator. Of course it was not for this, but in spite of it, that I have given you the command. Only those generals who gain success, can set up dictators. What I now ask of you is military success, and I will risk the dictatorship. The Government will support you to the utmost of its ability, which is neither more nor less than it has done and will do for all commanders. I much fear that the spirit which you have aided to infuse into the Army, of criticising their Commander, and withholding confidence from him, will now turn upon you. I shall assist you as far as I can to put it down. Neither you, nor Napoleon, if he were alive again, could get any good out of an army while that spirit prevails. And now beware of rashness. Beware of being over-confident, and undertake what you can fully perform.

Such a letter could only be written by a great and wise man. Lincoln's ideal general was of course not "Fighting Joe Hooker", but Grant, who was later appointed Commander-in-Chief. Lincoln trusted him implicitly, shared his hardships, although he was often frustrated and often suffered heavy casualties. Once, someone told Lincoln that Grant was drinking in the army, Lincoln asked what brand of liquor he was drinking, he was going to send a box to share with other generals. This reminds me of a story of George III. When a member of the cabinet said that Wolfe (the British general who conquered Quebec) was simply crazy, George III replied, "I really wish he would bite those incompetent generals." In the two battles of 1866 and 1870, both the German Emperor William and Prime Minister Bismarck were stationed at the General Headquarters on the battlefield, so various policy issues could be resolved directly, such as the bombardment of Paris. Moltke and Bismarck each maintained their position, and the German Emperor decided on the spot to implement it.

Next, I will talk about the last World War. During that long battle, the disputes and errors between soldiers and politicians were countless. These disputes and errors were not all on the British side. For example, the German military authorities refused to listen to the cabinet's advice and insisted on adopting a policy of unrestricted submarine warfare, which led to the United States' entry into the war. Germany's defeat may have been caused by this. On the other hand, when implementing the blockade policy, the British Grey was very careful to avoid causing resentment from the United States, regardless of the opposition of naval personnel.

At that time, the main and fierce disputes occurred between Lloyd George and Robertson, and the two men's opinions were almost always in conflict. If Robertson had been more submissive and Lloyd George had been less stubborn, the two men might have been able to cooperate very well. It is a pity. Robertson's mistake was that he too despised the strategic plans put forward by the Prime Minister. He did not explain to the Prime Minister what was wrong with these plans. Lloyd George's mistake was not in general strategic concepts, which were often excellent, but he lacked knowledge of the war machine - how long it took to transport troops from one place to another, how climate affected military operations, what geographical limitations there were, etc. For example, he once had a plan to borrow troops from France in the winter and send them to Palestine to wipe out the Turkish army, and then transfer them back in the spring, because there were no large-scale battles on the Western Front in winter. He just didn't know how much time and energy it would take to transport one or two divisions of troops from France to Palestine; how completely the transportation lines in Palestine would have to be rebuilt - which would take several months - before the newly arrived troops could be transported to the front; and although Palestine is in the eastern Mediterranean, the winter weather there is almost as unsuitable for combat as in France.

### Germany and the Soviet Union Sharpen Swords and Prepare for Spring Offensive: Vyazma, Critical for the Entire Situation, is the Center of Contention

Stockholm, Sweden (Havas News Agency dispatch) Military observers here recently stated that the winter season on the Soviet front is coming to an end. The warring parties are sharpening their swords and actively preparing for a large-scale spring offensive. In terms of climate, although March cannot be said to be spring in most of the Soviet Union, except for Crimea and southern Ukraine, the days are longer and the weather is milder. The fighting will of course gradually become more active again. Assuming the roads are not too bad, land operations will gradually become more intense. At this moment, the situation on the front lines at the beginning of March will clearly mark the beginning of a new phase of the war, and it will naturally have a decisive impact on the entire war situation. German forces have continued to advance eastward in the last twenty days, the first offensive since winter. German forces have recovered no less than eighty-five villages and towns. On the Red Army side, they have occupied the Aleksandrinkovo and Krasnaya railway stations north of Vyazma (only ten-plus miles from Vyazma) and have cut the railway from Vyazma to Rzhev. The future battlefield will be centered on Vyazma. The Red Army is attacking the city in two directions, one from Roslavl westward and the other from Dorogobuzh northeastward. The key to the future depends on how long the Red Army can hold the vital railway, because the Red Army there is threatened by German forces from the northeast, west, and south. In addition, the German army can directly attack from Vyazma, so the Red Army's situation is very difficult. In short, the Red Army's current position is not at all consistent with the German army's position at the beginning of December last year. At that time, the German army launched an autumn offensive and advanced eastward, reaching its peak. At the same time, the German army on the southern route, after arriving at Rostov, stagnated due to the arrival of winter. Afterward, the Red Army launched a large-scale counteroffensive, making considerable progress, but reviewing the map reveals that they failed to drive the German army out of the resistance strongholds. From Leningrad in the north to the Don River in the south, the most important military strategic points, such as Velikiye Luki, Rzhev, Vyazma, Smolensk, Orel, Kursk, Kharkov, etc., are still in the hands of the German army. In summary, the Red Army should not only limit itself to disrupting German preparations for the spring offensive in February, but should also strive to encircle and destroy the main enemy forces in order to occupy the aforementioned military strategic points, especially on the southern route. Therefore, this month is truly decisive for the German-Soviet war.

German Aircraft Attack Murmansk

Berlin, 2nd (Haitong News Agency dispatch) According to authoritative sources, German dive bombers attacked the Soviet port of Murmansk the day before yesterday, dropping multiple bombs in the city center and destroying a 10,000-ton merchant ship. German aircraft bombed Soviet positions on the Fischer Peninsula, causing fires everywhere.

Berlin, 2nd (Haitong News Agency dispatch) Authoritative sources in Berlin revealed last night that the Soviet army lost twenty-four aircraft on Saturday, twenty-three of which were shot down in aerial combat, and the remaining one was shot down by anti-aircraft artillery. German dive bombers attacked concentrations of Soviet infantry and tanks attempting to break through the German defenses in the central sector of the Eastern Front. The Soviet side lost eight tanks, three artillery pieces, forty-four transport vehicles, and fifty other armored vehicles. When the German army attacked a Soviet supply station and warehouse, a large amount of Soviet ammunition was destroyed.

Soviet Army Attacks Italian Positions

Rome, 1st (Havas News Agency dispatch) Military officials say that in the past few days, the Red Army on the Eastern Front has launched heavy attacks on the Italian positions, but the repeated offensives have been unsuccessful. For example, at dawn on the 27th of last month, the Red Army launched a fierce offensive under the cover of mortar and small- and medium-caliber artillery fire. The artillery fire was aimed directly at the positions occupied by the Italian "Turin Division." By dawn, the Red Army had been heavily damaged by accurate Italian artillery fire and retreated. Afterward, the Red Army launched a second offensive with fresh troops. In the afternoon of the same day, the Red Army expanded its pressure to the positions held by the "Third Mobile Division" and repeatedly attacked the Italian positions, but each attack failed. By sunset, the Red Army finally collapsed, leaving behind one hundred bodies on the battlefield and retreating. There were no changes in the positions of either side.

### US-France Relations: Vichy Seeks to Avoid Deterioration

Vichy, February 2nd, Havas - According to Havas reporters from semi-official sources, French authorities are paying close attention to the remarks made by US Undersecretary of State Welles on January 27th regarding France. France cannot express a definite view on this warning, as US Ambassador to France, Admiral Leahy, already fully understands France's position. Vichy is making every effort to promote friendly relations between the US and France. Other countries should also consider France's special international status. The continuation of French Ambassador to the US, Henry-Haye, in his position from January 1st for six months is clear evidence of the French government's desire to avoid deterioration in US-French relations.

### Martial Law in Eastern India, Evacuation Order in Burma

Saigon, February 2nd, Havas - News from New Delhi states that martial law has been declared in the eastern provinces of India. The Burmese government has ordered the evacuation of the Burmese people to India, with only two routes available: one from Rangoon to Dimapur in Assam, and the other from Prome to Akyab, from where there is a road directly to Calcutta.

### Bandung in the Java Highlands

The Dutch East Indies, as seen on a map, consist of four groups of islands: the Greater Sunda Islands, the Lesser Sunda Islands, the Moluccas, and New Guinea and its associated islands. Among these islands, Java is naturally the most important in terms of population density, level of development, and economic significance. Everyone knows that Batavia is not only Java's leading modern city, but also the foremost in the Dutch East Indies. However, not far from Batavia is Bandung, a rich highland at an altitude of 720 meters, with beautiful mountain scenery and cool, fresh air, making it Java's only scenic spot. Bandung is a central point connecting Batavia and Cirebon via highways, and it is also the final air station for Dutch airlines. Therefore, its importance has become apparent to the world due to the Pacific war. Japanese troops landed in northern Java a few days ago, and a fierce battle is underway involving land, sea, and air forces. This quiet and beautiful highland is now shrouded in the smell of gunpowder.

### Implementation of Civilian Policing System Awaits Final Preparations; Old Zhabei District to be Divided into Five Zones, Each with Several Bao Responsible for Security

It is learned that a civilian policing system is about to be established throughout the entire Public Concession. Currently, the only thing lacking for this system is the final preparations. Civilian policing groups will undertake auxiliary policing work. Civilian policing will

Old Zhabei District as Experimental Zone

Civilian policing will work closely with the Shanghai Municipal Police to minimize crime within the Public Concession. The Old Zhabei police district, due to the intensity of terrorist activities, will be the experimental zone. The civilian policing system in that district has been in operation for several days.

Establishing Policing Network; Civil Police Zones

The Public Concession Residents Association, which is still being organized, is currently studying all preparations for establishing a civilian policing network throughout the city. In addition to policing work, members will also participate in investigating the activities of suspicious individuals. The plan currently being implemented in the Old Zhabei district is to divide the entire district into five zones, each of which is further divided into several bao, with one civilian assigned to each bao to be responsible for security.

### Mail Thieves Steal and Open Mailboxes to Sell Stamps

The Shanghai Postal Administration has recently discovered that letters deposited in mailboxes are being stolen by people. The purpose of these thieves is to steal the stamps on the letters, which they then sell, hindering people's communication, which is extremely despicable. Therefore, strict attention has been ordered. At 4:00 PM the day before yesterday, mailman number 132 discovered a person using a wire-made key to open the mailbox at number 145 Jing'an Temple Road, stealing 73 letters. He immediately called Huatan Yan Bingheng to the scene, who arrested the person and took him to the Jing'an Temple police station. The suspect, named Kang Tingxi, a Shanghai native, confessed that he had previously stolen dozens of letters twice, selling the stamps without denying it. He was then detained pending further investigation.

### Swiss Consulate Takes Over Custody of Rights Office; Relocation of Address

Since the Swiss Consulate took over the custody of the rights and interests of expatriates from countries such as Britain, the United States, and the Netherlands in this city, the original organization of the Swiss Consulate is no longer adequate. The consulate has established a separate, specialized organization to handle the protection of the rights and interests of expatriates from five countries: Britain, the United States, the Netherlands, Cuba, and Panama. The previous office located at the Swiss Consulate on Avenue Joffre was temporary. It is reported that the consulate has leased office space at number 9 The Bund (French Shipping Company Building) in the French Concession as a permanent office. Starting today (the 3rd), the British, American, and Dutch interests protection department will be moved to that location for business. The office hours have also been changed to 9:30 AM to 1:00 PM daily.

### Kidnapping of an Old Goods Merchant's Son; Principal Offender Apprehended

On the night of February 26th last year, at around 7:00 PM, three kidnappers, one of whom was carrying a handgun, broke into the home of Chen Yixiang, a Jiangbei native who runs an old goods business at number 1085 Chengdu Road in the Public Concession, and kidnapped his two-year-old son, Chen Xiaogou, and disappeared. Afterwards, Chen reported the incident to the police station in charge, requesting an investigation. The kidnappers sent a letter demanding a ransom of 50,000 yuan. Chen sent someone to negotiate and secretly redeemed the child for 1,400 yuan. However, the police continued to actively search for the criminals in the case. On the 3rd of this month, Feng Baishun, chief detective of the Huishi police station, Deputy Chief Huang Fusen, Detective Li Hongyun, etc., were arresting criminals specializing in killing pigs in the Binbei area. They captured a criminal named Wang Shuangxi in room 24 of the Hu Ning Inn on Crane Road. After investigation, it was found that Wang was the principal offender in the Chen Xiaogou kidnapping case. After interrogation, he was sent to the criminal court. After a detailed hearing, he was ordered to be sentenced on the 9th.

### Price Hikes Resurge Rampantly; Management Committee Meets to Curb Them; Still Plans to Start with Thorough Investigation of Commodity Costs

The Price Management Committee of the French Concession, in view of the recent resurgence of rampant price hikes, which are seriously harming people's livelihoods, convened a meeting yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, inviting leaders from various industries in the city to discuss reviewing the market situation over the past few weeks and planning to curb price hikes. Invitees included representatives from the coal industry, rice industry, alcohol industry, foreign goods industry, fresh meat industry, etc. Chairman Weina reported the purpose of the meeting, and the discussion began immediately. All attending representatives advocated promptly suppressing prices and thoroughly investigating merchants' buying and selling costs. Weina agreed to continue studying concrete measures to implement them together.

### Allied Banks Will Require Tenants to Expedite Box Opening; Third Withdrawal Not Yet Implemented Immediately

Yesterday, all Allied banks in this city, except for the Citibank French Concession branch, which has closed down, continued to operate and handled deposits and requests for major loans in accordance with current procedures. Most of the depositors currently making deposits and withdrawals at these Allied banks are Allied nationals.

Chinese Depositors Mostly Completed

Most Chinese and neutral nationals have already completed these procedures. It is heard that starting yesterday, Allied national depositors can withdraw another two thousand yuan from their individual deposits under the second withdrawal item, subject to a limit of five hundred yuan per week. The safe deposit boxes of Allied banks will continue to be opened. The four banks currently authorized to open and withdraw items are Maijia Li, Datong, HSBC, and Huabi.

Box Items All Subject to Inspection

These banks may again require tenants who have not yet opened their boxes to expedite the opening procedures so that the Japanese cleaning staff stationed at each bank can inspect the items in the boxes. Gold bars, foreign currency, and foreign currency assets are not allowed to be withdrawn. However, legal tender assets, personal documents, jewelry, etc., may be allowed to be removed from the safe deposit boxes.

Banks Are Recovering Loans

The method of paying out the third withdrawal from Allied banks' individual deposits is unlikely to be announced soon. The intention of the Japanese cleaning staff in each bank seems to be to wait for the banks to continue to recover loans. After the banks collect funds to a roughly consistent level, withdrawals of deposits will be allowed.

### Fire Department Considers Modifying Pump Trucks; Using Coal or Wood Instead of Gasoline

According to the English-language "Great American Evening Post," Mr. Wade Kin, acting chairman of the Public Concession Fire Department, told reporters yesterday (the 2nd) that the department is currently considering converting the gasoline engines of some vehicles to engines that burn coal or wood in order to save resources. The plan is to station these converted vehicles on alert after major fires occur in warehouses, etc., as these fires sometimes require water to be sprayed on the embers for up to a week after they are extinguished. Currently, spraying water is still done with gasoline. If the pump trucks are converted to burn coal or wood, the use of gasoline will be greatly reduced. If this plan is approved, the first converted vehicle will likely be stationed at the Hongkou Fire Department, but can be driven to all areas of the Public Concession when needed. Only one such converted vehicle is sufficient because the above-mentioned task of guarding and alerting is less frequent. Mr. Wade Kin said that the Fire Department is doing its best to save gasoline, but the gasoline used by fire trucks cannot be reduced.

### Japanese Residents in Hongkou No Longer Need Passes to Cross Bridges

Starting the day before yesterday (February 2nd), Japanese residents in the Hongkou district no longer need passes to cross the bridges over the Suzhou Creek to other areas of the Public Concession.

### Rain and Snow Yesterday

The weather in this city has recently been disturbed by a low-pressure system again. Rain and wind persisted throughout the morning. At 2:00 PM yesterday afternoon, snow pellets mixed with the rain, and the climate became even worse. Because the air pressure has not changed, it is difficult to expect clear weather for the time being.

### Publicly Soliciting Adultery at Home; Husband Reports and Arrests Adulterers

Zhou Zhixiang, a 31-year-old man from Pudong who works in construction, married Zhao and has an eight-year-old daughter. He used to live at number 19 Yongfu Lane in Da Kang Li, Kangding Road. Recently, however, his wife became involved with Zhou YaÂ≥∞ (37 years old) from Guangdong, who lives at number 3 Putai Lane, Chengdu Road. They often met secretly at home when her husband was away. Because he repeatedly advised her without success, he found out that his wife and her lover were meeting secretly at home again the night before last, so he secretly reported it to the police station. The next morning at 6:00 AM, they went to arrest the adulterers, and arrested both of them and took them to the police station for questioning. The two admitted to adultery without denial. As a result, both the man and the woman were sentenced to four months of imprisonment as a warning.

However, the police continued to chase him. The thief, out of desperation, jumped off the roof of the third floor, falling onto the sidewalk and suffering serious injuries. He was finally captured and taken to the police hospital for treatment by the fire department ambulance.

### The Past and Present of Western Bookstores

‚Äî Yi

Bookstores are like flower shops. When there are no new products on the market, customers will stretch their necks and look forward to them.

Shanghai's Western readers have always awaited the supply of Western magazines, newspapers, and reading materials like waiting for letters from relatives and friends overseas. As long as foreign ships arrived, the telephones in the bookstores, the staff, and the old deliverymen would be busy.

1.  From Air Mail Delivery

The situation was like this two and a half months ago. Now, with the changing environment, the situation is naturally very different.

Those who like to read American-published magazines and newspapers‚ÄîShanghai Western bookstores that sell American publications account for the majority‚Äîit is best if all periodicals are sent by Pan American Airways. This is really like the movie-loving crowd, who wish Hollywood could release a new movie every week.

Popular magazines like Reader's Digest, Saturday Evening Post, Ladies' Home Journal, as well as Esquire, Life, and various movie and detective magazines, all have considerable sales.

When newly published British and American books were booming in the Shanghai market, we only needed to look at the store windows and counters, which were full of varieties just like the names they published in the newspapers.

2.  No Fresh Goods

Since the sound of cannons rang out in the Pacific, the Western bookstore business in Shanghai has inevitably been hit hard.

First, there are no fresh goods on the market. If you run to the bookstore to "inspect" it, newspapers and magazines after November 1941 are completely out of sight. The few remaining publications, June...July...August, September...are listlessly placed on the counter, like old maids who have wasted their youth and have not yet married, staying in empty boudoirs, not knowing when they will be able to change their desolate lives.

Second, it is affected by the general public's living pressure. Undoubtedly, foreigners account for the largest number of Western books and magazines readers. The lives of these people have now changed, and their economic turnover is not as good as before. Buying books and newspapers was originally one of the refinements of a leisurely life, but now it is naturally out of the question. As for the soaring prices, a thin book costs tens of dollars, which is of course beyond the means of ordinary people.

3.  Reading Under the Lamp

Then how do Western bookstores maintain themselves?

Like other shops selling imported goods, in a word, they sell remaining goods.

Selling books that are less time-sensitive‚Äîexcept for those on current affairs and political issues‚Äîa portion of specialized books, reference books, leisure reading materials, and some stationery and toys, these are their temporary way out. Books for learning languages are quite in demand by customers.

If you ask them, "Is there anything new?"

"That's all there is" is the answer.

In fact, there are more people who like to read now than before, and this is also due to the environment. Shanghai's nightlife has become exhausted, and movie theaters and dance halls are limited to the enjoyment of a few. People who know some characters should still accompany a lamp and calm down to read a book.

Famous Works Are on the Rise

According to the statistics of the Shanghai Municipal Council Public Library, there are more members borrowing books now than in the past. The most popular books for readers are biographies, followed by books on travel, art, literature, social sciences, and philosophy. Of course, the path of novels is never declining, but non-fiction is more popular than it was two months ago. The library currently has 1,570 annual members.

Literary works by famous writers, such as the collections of Shakespeare, Dickens, Moliere, etc., which everyone used to shout, "I don't have time to read!" and were set aside as too heavy, are now on the rise. In one day, out of the 362 books borrowed from the public library, only 130 were novels, and the others were mostly art, literature, social science, and philosophy books as mentioned above.

Wanting to gain some comfort from books in the midst of depression, the Bible, the "book of all books," has more readers and sells more smoothly. Heaven and earth can change, but this book will not perish. In this autumn of turbulent life, who would not want to obtain the most valuable inspiration from it!

### Good Sales Expected in the South; Yarn Soars Over 200 Yuan

The cotton yarn market continued to rise, and the momentum was very good. This was because Japanese yarn and cloth were soaring, and at the same time, it was reported that there were good sales expectations in the South Seas. As a result, people's confidence was revived, and the market gradually moved forward. 20-count Double Horse Factory single opened at 2,310 yuan. Afterwards, driven by the enthusiastic popularity, it gradually increased to 2,430 yuan. There was a slight pullback in the middle, but the result was still high. By the close of the market, the price increase resumed, and the peak reached 2,505 yuan. The closing price was 2,490 yuan, an increase of over 200 yuan compared to the weekend. 42-count Blue Phoenix was 5,660 yuan to 5,730 yuan, 42-count Shiguang was 5,500 yuan to 5,600 yuan, 32-count Xiantao was 4,950 yuan to 4,990 yuan, 20-count Double Earth was 2,600 yuan to 2,640 yuan, 20-count Tiannv was 2,770 yuan to 2,810 yuan, 20-count Double Horse spot was 2,720 yuan to 2,810 yuan, 20-count Blue Phoenix was 3,050 yuan. The spot factory single price was 3,230 yuan, 20-count Yueqin was 2,955 yuan, 18-count Zhinv was 2,690 yuan to 2,700 yuan, 60-count Liuma was 10,300 yuan, 60-count Xiantao was 9,800 yuan, 60-count Blue Phoenix was 10,120 yuan, and 16-count Hongkuixing was 2,400 yuan.

### Cloth Prices Rise Every Day

Wanting to Seek Clothes Is Also Impossible

Yesterday's cloth market rose sharply due to the crazy rise in yarn prices. People unanimously looked up, and customers on the street were particularly healthy in their appetite. The bottom of the goods was increasingly lacking. 16-pound Butterfly coarse cloth opened at 130 yuan, the same pound Earth was 117 yuan, and Flying Hong was 111 yuan, an increase of 4 yuan per piece. The shouting prices for light-pound brands were chaotic, and there were few sales. 12-pound Dapeng fine cloth opened at 104 yuan in the morning market, and Fugui fine cloth at 102 yuan. In the afternoon, there were buyers but few sellers. Longevity Fuchou rose to 4 yuan 5 jiao 5 fen per yard.

Eastern cloth rose sharply because there was plenty of silver in the market, outside hoarders were active, and at the same time, actual customer sales were also quite developed. 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth factory single opened at 121 yuan 5 jiao and rose to 125 yuan. It then returned to 124 yuan in the afternoon. The buying interest from all parties in the subsequent market was still surging, and it gradually rose from 124 yuan 5 fen to 126 yuan at the close. Flying Fish Colored Ball was 116 yuan 2 jiao 5 fen, Yang He was 115 yuan 5 jiao, Trumpet Five Blessings was 113 yuan 5 jiao, Five Blessings Double Fish fine twill was over 102 yuan 5 jiao, Treasure fine twill was 101 yuan, and Four Gentlemen Serge was at 4 yuan 1 jiao 5 fen at the evening close for the October to December factory single, and 4 yuan 01 fen for the Red factory single new tax, both rising by 2 jiao or more per yard. Four Gentlemen Shilin cloth was at 205 yuan in the morning and was shouted at 207 or 8 yuan in the afternoon. Xihe Shilin was 204 yuan, and Ding Ruyi bleached cloth was 135 yuan. The market atmosphere was very strong.

### Gold Prices in Struggle

Yesterday's spot gold in the black market continued to prosper steadily, but immediately fell back after breaking through the 14,000 yuan mark. This was because spot gold shops (selling competitively when seeing high prices) still mostly wanted higher prices. From 13,800 yuan (170 yuan higher per ten-tael bar) in the morning, Xiangxing, Yonghefa, and a certain gold shop and retail investors followed the trend and raised the price, continuing to rise by 300 yuan, reaching 14,100 yuan. Shengyuan, Yongchengji, Yongfengyu, and other spot shops sold vigorously when seeing high prices, and securities shops and retail investors limited the price and spat it out, so a reversal started, falling back to within 14,000 yuan, down to 13,850 yuan. It was very stable at noon, and the market closed at 13,900 yuan, an increase of 270 yuan compared to Saturday's closing price. The daily high and low also differed by 300 yuan. The transaction volume was still small. The jewelry shops, like Daxin and Tonghang, all hung 1,450 yuan per tael (reduced by 150 yuan for incoming goods). Fine silver was still hung at 14 yuan, and the black market was 12 and a half yuan. Silver coins were 7 and a half yuan each, and there were buyers.

Yesterday's foreign currency market saw stable British and American gold pounds. The former remained at 350 yuan, and the latter remained at 360 yuan. US dollar notes were at 17 yuan 05 fen, with sold positions. Hong Kong notes were still at 3 yuan, with large notes reduced by 1 jiao. Military notes initially opened at 4 yuan 4 jiao, and then gradually increased to 4 jiao 8 fen, and finally were at 4 yuan 4 jiao Niu.

### Domestic Debt and Foreign Stock Price Falls Fail to Cease

The clandestine public debt market and the downward trend in stock prices have not abated. Type A bonds even broke through the 70-yuan barrier. Although the downward trend is severe, some are covering their short positions, and the market price has already fallen for three consecutive days, with a decrease of as much as two yuan seven or eight cents to three yuan three or four cents. However, major bulls show no signs of emerging, perhaps a slight rebound is in store. Yesterday, Lianhe and Dakangcheng sold off more vigorously, while Tongkang and Dazhong also sold. Tongyi acted as an agent with both buying and selling, Hu Heji has already retracted his sleeves, and Yongkang bought a significant amount. The market was relatively stable at the beginning of trading, rising for a time, but then gradually showed weakness, and the downward trend resumed. The 70-yuan mark for Type A bonds was broken. The difference between high and low prices was still more than one yuan. As a result, Type A and Type B bonds fell by a relatively large amount of one yuan three or four cents, while the rest fell by only five or six cents. The transaction volume was about four or five hundred thousand yuan. A concise table is listed below:

Yesterday's foreign stock market situation remained low. Jardine Matheson spun yarn factory fell from twenty-three yuan two jiao and a half, eventually falling to twenty-three yuan. China Textile was nine yuan six jiao and nine yuan eight jiao, British Union twenty yuan, Ken Zhi twenty-two yuan two jiao five, Steel thirteen yuan six jiao, Lange Zhi fourteen yuan, with an opening of five thousand one hundred shares. Most of the rest had more supply than demand. Asia Navigation's buying price was nine yuan and a half, and selling price was eight yuan. Jardine Matheson Beer was five yuan two jiao and a half to five yuan seven jiao, tap water eleven or twelve yuan, Paper five yuan three jiao and six yuan, Telephone buying price twenty-two yuan, selling price twenty-five yuan, Xinyi Yarn Factory buying price six yuan zero five fen, selling price six yuan four jiao, Tram thirty-eight yuan, Chen Shi nine jiao and one yuan one jiao, Kailping thirty yuan, Ye Guang fifteen yuan one jiao, Power Priority ninety-four yuan and a half, Power bonds sixty-five yuan, British Zha Hua eighteen yuan, all had buyers, Public Bus nine yuan six jiao, Shanghai Silver Company thirteen yuan six jiao, Xiangtai Timber twenty-five yuan seven jiao five, Hengye ten yuan, Wheelock Marden fifty-five yuan, Shanghai Wool six yuan, Yangtze eleven yuan seven jiao, Jia Lun Dan one yuan zero two fen, Li Pai two yuan one jiao, Di Bang two yuan, all had supply but no demand, it is said.

### Spring Rain Blocks Access to Rice

Although the rice source from the country took a day off on Sunday noon, the continuous spring rain made transportation difficult, and the supply remained scarce, causing both cargo owners and guests to have good intentions and start early. As a result, the price of rice soared. At that time, early rice opened at two hundred and eighty yuan, and thin rice at two hundred and seventy-eight or nine yuan, and the result was always conservative in this market, without the slightest change in color. Compared with the previous week, it has risen sharply by as much as seven or eight yuan. Because thick japonica rice has already been expensive and high-quality goods are in short supply, only medium and lower-quality goods are slightly available on the market, with Kunshan white japonica rice opening at two hundred and ninety-four two yuan, and medium and lower-quality japonica rice at two hundred and ninety yuan and two hundred and eighty-eight yuan. In terms of the quality of the goods, it has also secretly increased by four or five yuan. White yuan has not been heard to open, and there is a saying that it is as high as two hundred and seventy-nine yuan.

### Soybean Price Rise Difficult to Quell

Starting yesterday, the edible oil wholesale department stipulated that 800 to 1,000 dan of rapeseed oil and refined oil should be distributed daily to retail stores by 25 agents in order to meet sales. As for newly arrived raw oil, it will also be available for distribution soon. The bulk raw oil ordered by the department is being shipped to Shanghai one after another, and soybean oil is still being loaded onto ships, which must wait for the facts to be confirmed.

Because hoarding households have reduced their activities in the soybean market, and actual sales are not very active, the prices of both yellow soybeans and red beans have fallen by three to five yuan, while the rest are weak. It is estimated that 500 bags of Tianjin Jinyuan were sold at a price of 175 yuan to 170 yuan, and 150 bags of green beans were sold at a price of 175 yuan. One cart of Changzhou Niupi Huang was sold at a price of 160 yuan, and 30 bags of Niupi Qing were sold at a price of 161 yuan. 150 bags of Chongming Sha Huang were sold at a price of 153 yuan, 50 bags of Pinghu Du Dou were sold at a price of 170 yuan, 200 bags of Chongming Sha Chi were sold at a price of 130 yuan to 128 yuan, 100 bags of Sha Can were sold at a price of 90 yuan to 91 yuan, and more than 130 bags of Benniu Dou were sold at a price of 128 yuan. 60 bags of Nanjing Jiangdou were sold at a price of 125 yuan.

### "Meat Prices" and "Rice Jin"

‚Äî Zhi Cang

"The poorer, the more bitter, the more difficult," this old saying has existed since ancient times, but it is especially severe today. At the end of the Lunar New Year, the prices of all goods soared, and the market prices varied greatly from morning to night. Just taking pork as an example, because everyone needed it to celebrate the holiday, it became extremely popular, and even jumped to more than five or six yuan. Well-to-do families had already bought it more than ten days ago, but it was only more than three yuan per jin. Brokers came and went casually, and as the end of the year approached, they were like ants on a hot pot. It was not easy to get the money back, but it was already between the 28th and 29th, and finally, they were gouged by speculators who specialized in slaughtering pigs. After the Lantern Festival, the custom of "Lantern dumplings fall off the lantern cakes" also passed in a hurry, but some goods took advantage of the remaining momentum and continued to rise wildly. As for meat, it did not fall back down. The Public Works Bureau and the Municipal Council, in view of this, have reportedly begun to investigate and suppress meat prices.

The authorities' move is also a painstaking effort. Originally, the nutritional value of meat has always been praised by us. It is rich in protein and fat, which is extremely beneficial to the human body, and it is even more "love at first sight" for people with pale complexions. However, in recent years, everyone seems to have rarely had anything to do with it. Confucius "did not know the taste of meat for three months," that was because he had attended a concert and felt that way. At the time of "starvation in Chen," if he "did not worry about scarcity but worried about inequality," it seemed that there was no need to politely decline. Nowadays, we descendants are eager to get some lard back to mix in the porridge, but this opportunity has to wait for an auspicious day - waiting for the banknotes to circulate a little more freely before we can taste the exotic flavor. As for "big chunks" of meat, or even stir-fried shredded pork, we have not touched it, and it seems that it has been "many years since then," and we can't help but feel the emotion of recalling the past. Not to mention "if it is not cut properly, do not eat it."

However, people's faces have become sallow as a result. Why is this? The authorities understand, so they want to suppress meat prices. People's purchasing power is also too pitiful, and rice is also in danger. They desperately squeeze to buy it, and meat? They think about it - rice only has some starch in it.

But I really don't understand why some round-faced, pot-bellied people also desperately joke with the poor. A certain rice shop on a certain road, selling foreign rice, the common people squeezed in line until they were out of breath, but they were selling "three or four liang short per jin" (see the 28th newspaper last month), which is really hateful! Some people argued with them and were "punched with old fists" (also see the newspaper a few days ago). This is even less edible than the meat of the meat vendors!

This is naturally difficult to pardon by law. The order to close down and revoke the license should be faster and more frequent to be enjoyable!

Miscellaneous Talks on Art

### Dangzi Troupe

‚Äî Ze Fu

The Dangzi troupe, also known as the small troupe, began in the Jiaqing period. It selects young children aged eleven or twelve, all with clear eyebrows and bright eyes, dresses them as women, and teaches them the "Dang" tunes of lewd lyrics and small songs. When there are festive banquets, they are invited to come, and they perform on the stage, linking arms and singing, and people compete to laugh and cheer. At that time, in addition to the popularity in Pingjin, Jiangxi and Guangdong also had this trend. In the middle of the Guangxu period, this kind of small troupe began to appear in Shanghai. The people came from Jiangxi, and the most famous was An Li. Her family had a small stage, and those who attended the banquet could order them to perform and dance on the stage and even serve wine. For a time, high officials and wealthy merchants flocked to it. Later, because it was harmful to public morals, it was banned, and since then, it has not been performed again, and it is also performed in private houses, so it is also called the Qingyin troupe, or the Xiaotang name. Today, in the areas of Suzhou and Shanghai, wealthy families still hire this kind of small troupe for festive occasions, preparing exquisite table settings on the table, playing and singing to add to the enjoyment. However, the selected young children are mostly dressed in rags and have unpleasant faces, and are no longer like those who dressed as women in the past and could make high officials and wealthy merchants admire them.

### Sharing the Same Boat in Storms

‚Äî He Jia Zhi

(I) Stormy Evening

The boat maintained its old habit of leaning to the left. The sound of wind and rain stopped, and instead, the people on the boat heard the sound of the bow cutting through the river water, whooshing. The clearest sound was heard by Guo Fang. She occasionally opened her eyes and took a tour of the large cabin. The glass lamp was swaying slightly, radiating light. She looked at the biscuits and candies scattered on the quilt, but did not want to clean them up. She stretched out her rather wide sleeves and opened the door at the back. At the back, there was a cabin that could only accommodate one person to sleep. She dragged a black long-haired camel hair coat out of the cabin. But when the coat came over, the green raincoat also came along with it. She only wanted the coat and put it over her brother and Wei Cheng's quilts.

Wei Cheng and Guo Qi were both asleep, making slight snoring sounds. Then Guo Fang also lay down. About an hour after Guo Fang lay down, Wei Cheng suddenly sat up and tried his hand. He saw that Guo Qi and Guo Fang were both resting their necks high on the pillows and had not been awakened by his shaking. He slowly knelt on one foot and stood on the other, still reaching out his hand. At this time, Guo Fang suddenly woke up. As soon as she woke up, she said, "What do you want?" Wei Cheng smiled and said, "Ah, you are not sound asleep. I feel that the cabin door is open, and there will be wind blowing in. I feel it even though I am far away. You must feel it even more. I wanted to close it. There is nothing else." Guo Fang sat up in one go and said, "I opened it. I forgot to close it after opening it. You sit down." (II)

### "Trinity" Theory - High Prices, Few Students, Low Salaries

‚Äî Ya Xi

Schools have all started, but similarly, they are all experiencing panic, which is: at the beginning of the school year, few students have returned from the winter vacation! As far as the writer knows, one school has only three students in one grade, but there are as many as seven teachers. However, because of face-saving reasons, they know that it is not good business, but they still "operate in a hazy manner," which is really like a mute eating Coptis chinensis, unable to express their suffering! Of course, this is a common situation, and the advertisements for enrollment in newspapers are still full of pages, which is clear evidence.

Regarding "few students," what is the root cause? The increase in tuition fees is certainly one reason, but the most fundamental reason is still the surge in the cost of living. Life is still precarious, so of course, they can't afford to study.

Because there are few students, although the fees have increased sharply, income is still insufficient to cover expenses. Therefore, in order not to "lose money," they have no choice but to drastically reduce the salaries of teachers and staff. Among the teachers and staff of a certain middle school, the salary is as low as 40 yuan, and they still provide accommodation but not meals. Under such high-pressure living conditions, how can a mere 40 yuan survive this difficult life? As a result, this teacher "rolled up his bedding and returned to his hometown." If all the teachers and staff in Shanghai follow the same path, what would be the consequences?

Writing this, I can't help but "throw away the pen" and "sigh three times."

### Stage and Screen

‚Äî Tai Xu

The plan to restage "Peking Man" at "Lafayette" has been cancelled, not because Zeng Si Yi's role has no successor after Ying Yin's death, but because a new play is eager to be staged. That new play is "Spring," which "Lafayette" has been advertising for a long time. "Home" caused a sensation for a time and was performed again and again. As a result, the movie "Home," the Yue opera "Home," the Shanghai opera "Home," and even the comic "Home," were simply "Home" everywhere. The popularity of Ba Jin's works can be seen from this. "Mei Xiang" has been operating at an average level for the past two months, and now it is probably the chance to make a fortune when "Spring" arrives. "Spring" was adapted by Director Hu, and everything was negotiated with Suo Fei, Ba Jin's representative in Shanghai. It is said that the performance tax is 11%, and the original author and the adapter share the proceeds equally, which seems much cheaper than the 20% of "Peking Man."

After "Tears on a Fragrant Note," a large number of film scripts such as "Polyandry Precious Mirror," "Returning to the Broken Blue Bridge," and "Dinner Party" are being adapted. When there is a shortage of film, some items should also be "seen on stage."
