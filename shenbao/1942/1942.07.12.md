### Japanese Troops Cross the Ou River and Continue Advancing Towards Wenzhou; Japanese Aircraft Bomb Mountainous Areas

From the Eleventh Day of the Allied News Agency Frontline in Zhejiang Province: Japanese troops threatening Wenzhou, the last important base in southeastern Zhejiang Province, reached both sides of the Ou River this afternoon, preparing to attack Wenzhou. Before advancing on Wenzhou, the Japanese troops captured key points such as Qingtian and Wenxi on the banks of the Ou River within four days after launching a new offensive. The Ou River, after repeated and severe flooding, is rapidly returning to its original state, and the Japanese naval forces are providing great assistance, accelerating the advance of the Japanese troops along the river. Japanese aircraft have also been conducting large-scale bombings of mountainous areas since early morning.

Eleventh Day of the Allied News Agency from a Japanese Base in Eastern Zhejiang: Japanese troops are still advancing south along the Ou River, having captured the Wenxi border up to eight kilometers southeast of that point, twenty kilometers from Wenzhou. This is the last important destination for the Japanese troops in northeastern Zhejiang Province. After crossing the Ou River, the Japanese troops have been attacking from both sides, and are still moving south towards Wenzhou.

Eleventh Day of the Allied News Agency from Jinhua: After occupying Wenxi, the Japanese troops on the Ou River arrived at the banks of the Ou River, eight kilometers southeast of the town and approximately twenty kilometers from Wenzhou, at 6:00 PM on the tenth. One unit crossed the Ou River near Xiushan, while another unit continued south along Yanshan.

### Thailand and Vietnam Sign Border Agreement in Saigon Yesterday; Vietnam Cedes Over 69,000 Square Miles of Land to Thailand

Eleventh Day of the Allied News Agency from Saigon: Since the Thailand-French Vietnam Border Commission began its work on July 11th of last year, exactly one year has passed. Representatives from both sides, along with Japanese representatives, signed an agreement at the City Hall here this morning. According to a public statement, "The commissioners of the Japan, Thailand, and French Vietnam Border Affairs Commission held their fourth meeting at the Saigon City Hall this morning at 9:00 AM, signing several protocols, including (1) demarcating the border between French Vietnam and Thailand, (2) stipulating a demilitarized zone, and (3) a final protocol. After the signing ceremony, Commissioner Yano and the chief representatives of the French and Thai delegations delivered congratulatory speeches." According to the newly established border agreement, French Vietnam formally ceded 69,034 square miles of land, including northern and southern Laos and a portion of Cambodia, to Thailand.

Eleventh Day of the Allied News Agency from Saigon: The border dispute between Thailand and Vietnam, which has been mediated by Japan since January of last year, has been resolved after a year of effort with the conclusion of a treaty. The Border Demarcation Trilateral Commission convened its fourth plenary session at the Saigon City Hall on the eleventh, formally signing the new border protocol, the establishment of a demilitarized zone protocol, and the final protocol. Representatives from both the Japanese and Thai delegations arrived at the City Hall ten minutes before the start of the ceremony. At 11:00 AM sharp, the Japanese mediation representative, Chairman Yano, announced the opening of the meeting, and after reading the various protocols in Japanese, Thai, and Vietnamese, the fifteen representatives from the three countries formally signed the protocols, and then held a public meeting. After the guests were seated, Chairman Yano first gave a congratulatory speech, thanking the commissioners of the three countries for their hard work. Representatives from Vietnam and Thailand also gave speeches successively, and then went to another room to toast each other. This historically significant scene came to an end. The commission is scheduled to hold a formal dissolution ceremony at Panhe at the end of this month.

### Japan-Thailand Economic Negotiations Reach Agreement in Principle

Eleventh Day of the Haitong News Agency from Bangkok: The Thai economic delegation, led by Panananda, returned home on the sixth after going to Tokyo for economic negotiations and obtaining a loan of 200 million yen. Today, he met with a reporter from the Haitong News Agency and stated that the economic negotiations had reached an agreement in principle, but detailed items still needed to be clarified. However, all his hopes had been fully realized. Japanese officials who participated in the negotiations in Tokyo also arrived in Bangkok with Envoy Hirota and will continue negotiations here, while other issues will be discussed with the embassy. Rice is the main export of Thailand, as everyone knows. Although Japan can now purchase the large quantities of goods it previously purchased in Thailand within its occupied areas, Japan will still purchase a certain amount of goods from Thailand in order to strengthen commercial and friendly relations between the two countries. The most important issue in Japan-Thailand commercial relations is the transportation issue. Thailand has very few ships, which are insufficient for its needs, so Thailand relies heavily on Japan and other countries. Therefore, Thailand must include clauses related to transportation issues in every commercial agreement it signs. Thailand has now borrowed 200 million yen from Japan, which is of great significance for Thailand's reconstruction efforts. Mr. Ba is very willing to answer various inquiries, but he regrets that he cannot provide detailed explanations.

### Old Currency Redemption in Suzhou and Other Places to End on the Fourteenth

Central News Agency Report: The Old Currency Consolidation Committee designated Suzhou, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces, and Shanghai and Nanjing cities for the redemption of old currency, which has already expired. Shanghai and Nanjing cities implemented a ban on the use of old currency starting June 25th.

It is now learned that the extension of the redemption period for old currency in the cleansed areas has been decided to end on July 14th and will not be extended further. After the ban is implemented, if merchants or residents are found using old currency again, they will be punished according to law. The Old Currency Consolidation Committee has dispatched personnel to the various areas to conclude the redemption process.

### Gandhi Proposes Resolution to the Congress Party Insisting on Eliminating British Influence

Eleventh Day of the Allied News Agency from Lisbon: According to Reuters' Walter Drey, Gandhi presented a resolution to the executive committee of the National Congress Party on the tenth. It is understood that the resolution aims to immediately begin an anti-British movement by emulating the methods of disobedience and passive resistance movement launched in 1941. The central argument of this resolution is that India's independence cannot be ensured unless British influence is expelled. It also advocates that the National Congress Party should immediately launch a military non-cooperation movement among the Indian people. The resolution also leaves room for future negotiations with the British government. Leaders of the Congress Party have expressed their opposition to compromise with Britain, so it is believed that this resolution demonstrates India's determined attitude towards Britain.

Eleventh Day of the Haitong News Agency from Bangkok: Yesterday, the All-India Congress Committee, which met in Sevagram, India, discussed the political situation in India.

### Japanese Organize Company to Salvage Sunken Ships

Eleventh Day of the Allied News Agency from Tokyo: Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, a large number of enemy British and American ships have sunk in southern waters. In the spring of this year, Japan's Yamashita Steamship Co., Ltd. and others organized the Greater East Asia Naval Association to engage in salvage work. In view of the urgent need to expand shipping, it has been expanded and reorganized into the Greater East Asia Maritime Industries Co., Ltd., increasing its capital to 10 million yen. With the permission of the relevant authorities, it has been decided to convene an inaugural meeting at the end of July, and large-scale salvage operations will be carried out for sunken ships.

### U.S. Pacific Fleet Commander Nimitz Slightly Injured

### Turkey Takes Preventive Measures on Border; Turkey Maintains Friendship with Britain and Germany; Foreign Policy Unlikely to Change

Eleventh Day of the Havas News Agency from Istanbul: The military developments on the Soviet front and in Egypt have prompted the Turkish government to take preventive measures along its southeastern borders. The number of border troops has been increased, and the police have also tightened control in various regions. The government authorities are deeply concerned that if there is a collapse on either the Soviet or Egyptian side, large numbers of refugees will flee into Turkish territory. However, this does not mean that the border will be completely sealed; small-scale transportation will continue as usual.

Tenth Day of the Havas News Agency from the Capital of Turkey: After Prime Minister Saydam passed away in Istanbul a few days ago, his remains were transported here today by special train for a state funeral. President İsmet İnönü, Chief of General Staff General Çolak, the entire cabinet, and the Speaker of the Grand National Assembly greeted the coffin at the station. The coffin was then transported to the cemetery by artillery carriage for burial. At the same time, newspapers wrote articles welcoming former Foreign Minister Saraçoğlu as the successor to the Prime Minister, stating that Turkish foreign policy is unlikely to change as a result. The semi-official "Kömeljer" newspaper reported that Turkey is adhering to its neutral stance unchanged. Saraçoğlu, during his tenure as foreign minister, not only signed alliance treaties with Britain and France but also personally drafted a friendship treaty with Germany, leading Turkish foreign policy for many years. He has repeatedly stated that Turkey is determined to abide by both treaties. Since the outbreak of the European war, Turkey has always acted with a realistic spirit, and there is no reason to believe that Turkey will adopt any major decisions after this non-political cabinet reshuffle. According to news from the Balkan Peninsula, Saraçoğlu's appointment as the head of the Turkish government is extremely welcomed by neighboring countries. The Bulgarian semi-official "柴拉報" newspaper stated that Saraçoğlu's succession as Prime Minister is another clear demonstration of President İsmet İnönü's desire to implement Turkey's neutrality policy. Saraçoğlu is an experienced diplomat who is well-versed in international affairs, and his appointment as Prime Minister will certainly live up to the expectations of the people. In addition, Berlin also expressed goodwill towards Saraçoğlu, referring to him as the initiator of the German-Turkish friendship treaty.

### French Cabinet Discusses Attitude Towards the United States

### Over 170,000 French Workers Go to Germany

Tenth Day of the Havas News Agency from Vichy: Since Head of Government Laval delivered a speech on the 22nd of last month, calling on French workers to go to work in Germany, tens of thousands have responded. Workers in the Paris industrial area have been particularly enthusiastic, with 11,658 people applying from June 24th to July 7th, including 2,715 women. In the provinces, many people have also voluntarily gone to work in Germany, especially in the industrial centers of southern France, such as Marseille, Nice, and Toulouse, where the recruitment of workers has been very successful. Marseille has recruited 2,000 people, Nice 900 people, and Toulouse 600 people. Foreign nationals who came to France to earn a living before the war have all transferred to Germany. No fewer than 6,000 Algerians from North Africa are also willing to work in Germany. As of the 30th of last month, a total of 170,800 French workers have already departed for Germany. The railway authorities have prepared four special trains to transport workers to Germany in the coming week, each train capable of carrying 900 workers. The total number of French workers registered to work in Germany from the 1st to the 10th of this month will be announced soon.

### U.S. Mobilizes to Search for Axis Submarines

Tenth Day of the Allied News Agency from Zurich: The Geneva News' London correspondent recently reported that the U.S. government admitted on the fifth that the number of United Nations ships lost off the U.S. Atlantic coast and in the Caribbean Sea in the first half of this year totaled 307. This has stimulated British public opinion, and criticism of the U.S. for failing to protect its coast has intensified. The United States believes that the secret bases of the Axis submarines are within the United States, and has recently mobilized police officers to conduct extensive searches. However, the elusive activities of the Axis submarines have left Britain and the United States with no clues to be found.

Eleventh Day of the Haitong News Agency from Berlin: The Berlin Financial News detailed today the question of how Axis submarines have been able to repeatedly achieve success in the Caribbean Sea. The report first clarified the importance of the Caribbean Sea and its coastal areas. The author pointed out that the best oil fields in the United States are mostly located in the states of Texas and Louisiana, and the gasoline produced is transported to various locations on the Atlantic coast of the United States and Canada. The oil produced from the oil fields in Mexico is also transported through Caribbean ports for distribution. There are also oil fields in southern Venezuela, and the oil produced is mostly transported from the Gulf of Maracaibo to Aruba and Curaçao for refining. In addition to gasoline, sugar from Cuba, copper from Mexico, bauxite from Guyana, cotton from the southern United States, and bananas from the West Indies and Central America are all located in this area. Why is it that the United States has not strictly guarded such an important area, allowing Axis submarines to operate in the Caribbean Sea? U.S. expert Eliot Waterman wrote a book explaining the inadequacy of defense in this area. In 1939, the military bases of Puerto Rico and St. Thomas were still undefended. Although the ports of Tampa, Mobile, and New Orleans had been fortified, they did not have sufficient military force to defend them. Now, even if Britain and the United States want to strengthen their defenses, it cannot be completed in a short time. Therefore, the U.S. Navy cannot prevent German submarines from entering America's Mediterranean – the Caribbean Sea.

Islamic Holy Land – The Ancient City of Mecca

Mecca, in Saudi Arabia on the eastern shore of the Red Sea, is a world-renowned holy city of Islam. Annually, as many as 150,000 Muslims from various regions travel long distances to make a pilgrimage here. Before the birth of Muhammad, the founder of Islam, Mecca was already a trade center for caravans on the eastern shore of the Red Sea. The illustration shows vendors gathered in front of the city gate of Mecca. When pilgrims arrive here, they shout, "Lord, I have come to you, awaiting your command."

Allied Ships Continue to Be Sunk

Eleventh Day of the Haitong News Agency from Lisbon: Washington dispatches, the U.S. Navy Department announced yesterday that a British cargo ship, the "中星" (Zhong Xing), was sunk by an Axis submarine off the northern coast of South America. This is the fourth ship acknowledged by the U.S. Navy Department to have been sunk on Friday. Reports from Ottawa indicate that during a meeting of the Canadian House of Commons yesterday, it was revealed that a convoy of 14 Allied ships sailing from the Gulf of St. Lawrence was attacked by submarines en route, resulting in three ships being torpedoed and sunk.

Eleventh Day of the Haitong News Agency from Lisbon: Washington dispatches, the U.S. Navy Department announced last night that a small American cargo ship, a medium-sized British cargo ship, and a medium-sized Belgian cargo ship serving the United States have sunk in the Atlantic Ocean and the Caribbean Sea. The total number of ships sunk off the east coast of the United States has now reached 370.

Eleventh Day of the Haitong News Agency from Lisbon: The Cuban Naval Headquarters announced last night that a Honduran ship was sunk by gunfire from an Axis submarine. This is the eighth transport ship of the Allies to have been sunk yesterday.

List of British Ships Sunk Published

Eleventh Day of the Haitong News Agency from Berlin: The German High Command issued a statement saying that because Churchill has prohibited the publication of British tonnage losses, the British side has remained silent about its losses in the Atlantic war since June 1, 1941. Therefore, the German High Command will henceforth publish a list of British ships sunk. The first batch of fourteen ships has been published, with their names and tonnage as follows: "惠司晚麻蘭號" (Huisiwan Malanhao) (8,967 tons), "森茂色特厦號" (Senmaosete Xahao) (9,716 tons), "瑙福克號" (Naufukehao) (2,961 tons), "海洋冒險號" (Haiyang Maoxianhao) (6,800 tons), "霍金斯夫人號" (Huojinsifurenhao) (79,88 tons), "凱克波爾號" (Kaikeboerhao) (4,842 tons), "披爾麻號" (Pielmahao) (4,581 tons), "林洛斯坦號" (Linluositanhao) (5,478 tons), "克勞斯皮爾號" (Kelaosipierhao) (5,463 tons), "孫帝國號" (Sundiqiuhao) (力,228 tons), "阿登伏號" (Adengfuhao) (力,024 tons), "英加拿大號" (Ying Jianadahao) (5,268 tons), "勃洛特伐爾號" (Boloutefaerhao) (3,385 tons), and "海格男爵號" (Haigenanjuehao) (3,391 tons).

### Allied Convoy Lost in the Arctic Ocean

German reconnaissance aircraft discovered three heavily loaded giant merchant ships sinking in the currents in the Barents Sea, with no ships or warships escorting them. German aircraft also discovered a defeated convoy in the Barents Sea, including three cargo ships, and launched a sudden attack despite the adverse weather, sinking a 7,000-ton cargo ship. At the same time, German submarines also sunk two transport ships fully loaded with tanks, with a total displacement of 13,000 tons. Therefore, the German army has sunk a total of 230,700 tons of enemy ships in the Arctic Sea.

### German Forces Launch Full-Scale Offensive Along the Don River; Front Line Extends 500 Miles; Soviets Admit Fall of Rossosh

Allied News Agency, Berne, Switzerland, 11th. After German forces on the Eastern Front crossed the Don River at two locations, the main force of the Fourth Army led by Lieutenant General Kleist, though still concentrated on the west bank of the river, possesses sufficient strength to launch a large-scale offensive on the east bank. The German forces crossed the river at Voronezh and Rossosh. The Soviet authorities officially admitted the fall of Rossosh at midnight yesterday. The battle line from Voronezh to Rossosh is approximately 150 miles long, with about one million troops engaged on both sides, it is said.

Haitong News Agency, Ankara, 11th. The Soviet midnight communique on Friday stated that Rossosh, located 150 miles east of Kharkov and 110 miles south of Voronezh on the lower Don River, has been lost.

Havas News Agency, Stockholm, Sweden, 10th. The German full-scale offensive against the Soviet Union is now underway. The objective of the German command is not to seize cities and territories, nor to annihilate the Red Army, but to inflict a fatal blow on the Soviet Union by capturing the industrial areas of the Donets Don River, Volga River, and Caucasus, all at once. Fierce battles are still in progress at Kursk, Voronezh, Kupiansk, and Rossosh, and are gradually spreading towards the Don and Volga rivers. Battlefield news remains chaotic. What is known is that the battle line extends for 500 miles, with hundreds of thousands of soldiers engaged. The positions are intricate, and the battle situation is confused. It is reported that at a certain battlefield, both sides used approximately 300 tanks each, engaging in fierce combat. German and Soviet aircraft are also assisting in the battle from the air. However, the ground battle is a complete melee, making it impossible to distinguish friend from foe when viewed from above, rendering it impossible for pilots to carry out bombing raids. German sources claim that the entire Soviet army has begun to collapse. However, the "Red Star," the Red Army's official newspaper, only admits that German forces entered the Rossosh region yesterday and that Soviet forces retreated to pre-arranged positions in excellent order. Another report states that the German Bock force is using no fewer than 2,000 tanks in that area. The main force of Timoshenko's army between the Oskol and Don rivers narrowly escaped encirclement. There was still street fighting in the northwest of Voronezh yesterday, but German forces have bypassed the city and continued to advance north, building several new bridges across the Don River, advancing both north and south, using the Don River as a shield to prevent Soviet flanking attacks. In addition, German forces from the northwest and southwest of Voronezh have made contact at Okol, a city 80 miles east of Voronezh on the railway line from Yelets to Stalingrad, forming a pocket. The Soviet forces in the pocket are fiercely resisting the shrinking perimeter, but after a fierce battle, the Soviet forces have broken through a three-mile gap in the north, and part of the Soviet forces have broken out and made contact with General Chuykov's forces. Furthermore, German forces have been massing troops at Kursk, Belgorod, and Kupiansk in recent days, and it is said that they have broken through the Soviet lines and are advancing east and southeast, which is likely a prelude to a large-scale military operation.

Thrilling Tank Battles: German Side Employs Mysterious Tactics

Allied News Agency, Lisbon, 10th. According to American sources, German forces that arrived after linking Voronezh and Rossosh suddenly deployed over 2,000 tanks on the 10th, completing the crossing of the Don River. Both sides are now engaged in tank battles in a certain area of Voronezh. Thousands of tanks from both armies are concentrated in a small area, and heavy rain has caused both armies to engage in deadly combat in the mud.

Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 11th. German military experts recently stated that the German and Allied forces adopted new tactics during the large-scale offensive on the southern sector of the Eastern Front. Before the offensive was launched, the concentration and movement of troops was shrouded in mystery. Even General Timoshenko's aerial reconnaissance was unable to obtain any information, and he was unable to take timely countermeasures. The concentration of German troops and equipment was like flowing water, never staying in one place for more than 24 hours. Therefore, the necessary troops were concentrated in a selected location within 24 hours before the offensive was launched. Due to the vastness of the theater of war, this tactic has achieved remarkable results, it is said.

Successful Counteroffensive in the Oryol Region: Soviet Forces Advance Over 70 Miles

Havas News Agency, Stockholm, Sweden, 10th. According to Soviet sources, the Soviet counteroffensive in the Oryol region has resulted in an advance of over 70 miles. German forces are reportedly massing reinforcements to rush to the area.

Allied News Agency, Berlin, 11th. The German official news agency reported that Soviet forces attempted to land on the Kerch Peninsula at the eastern end of Crimea but were repelled by German coastal defense forces.

### Breaking Two Days of Silence: Fierce Fighting Resumes in Egypt; German Forces Launch New Offensive at El Alamein; British Consolidate Defenses in the Nile Delta

Allied News Agency, Lisbon, 11th. According to Cairo sources, after British forces in Egypt launched a strong attack on the northern front lines at El Alamein and were repelled by Axis forces, German General Rommel immediately led his troops in a sudden attack from the southern sector, advancing further east. British sources say that there is no correlation between the two locations, while a British communique acknowledges that Axis forces on the southern sector have moved east and that fighting is taking place in that area. The sudden outbreak of fighting has broken the two-day silence of the fierce battles in the Egyptian desert.

Haitong News Agency, Rome, 11th. Italian military headquarters officials stated that fierce fighting is taking place in the El Alamein area. Axis forces on the southern sector have forced the enemy to retreat, while fierce fighting has also broken out on the northern sector, with repeated enemy attacks failing. The German and Italian air forces engaged in a major battle with enemy aircraft yesterday, shooting down 33 enemy aircraft.

Haitong News Agency, Stockholm, Sweden, 11th. According to London sources, the battle for Alexandria has already begun. It is still uncertain whether the power to launch the battle rests with General Rommel or General Auchinleck. The British believe that Auchinleck, having received a large number of reinforcements, seems capable of launching a large-scale offensive. It is reported that Auchinleck has issued an order prohibiting the release of any reports regarding the battle at present.

Havas News Agency, Egyptian Border Area, 10th. The Egyptian battle is currently in a stalemate, which is likely a prelude to a large-scale German offensive. The warring parties are temporarily adopting a mutually vigilant posture. The fighting has been particularly quiet for the past 24 hours, with sparse artillery fire and infantry activity limited to patrols. British forces once launched a localized attack on the southern sector. The British authorities are clearly wary of the German preparations to attack the Nile Delta and are now shortening their defensive lines and attempting to prevent Axis forces from consolidating their positions in the occupied areas. However, the strength of General Rommel's forces in North Africa remains very strong. The current stalemate does not mean that the plan to attack the Nile Delta has been abandoned. Military experts agree that the German forces will launch a renewed offensive to the east within two or three weeks. As the forces of General Auchinleck, commander of British forces in the Middle East, continue to receive reinforcements, the Axis authorities will find it difficult to sit idly by and are more inclined to attack as soon as possible rather than delaying further. At the same time, the Axis authorities appear to be making every effort to improve and strengthen their transportation lines to enable reinforcements to arrive quickly and provide support to troops who have been fighting hard for about seven weeks. The Axis forward positions are also being strengthened. Their lines are not continuous; some strongholds have trenches and are equipped with strong artillery and flat-trajectory gun emplacements, and are defended by artillery and infantry. Their armored divisions are resting behind the lines, waiting to be replenished with fresh troops. On the British side, their 9th and 10th Army units are constantly arriving to allow the badly defeated 8th Army to be fully reorganized. Minor defensive works have also been deployed on the Nile Delta.

Silence Before the Storm: Egyptian Crisis Unabated

Haitong News Agency, Stockholm, Sweden, 11th. According to the latest reports from London, the situation in North Africa remains unchanged. Apart from minor skirmishes and artillery duels, the situation can generally be described as quiet, but its seriousness has not diminished. It would be premature to say that General Rommel's offensive has been definitely repelled. According to military experts, the outcome of this battle will depend on who can obtain the fastest and strongest reinforcements. London acknowledges that General Rommel has received substantial reinforcements in the past few days, while British reinforcements and war materials are steadily arriving at Alexandria. Captain Hart, the Daily Mail's military correspondent, says that unless the Axis forces are defeated or driven back to Tobruk, the current crisis will not be eliminated. The current lull is not a sign of an improvement in the situation. It can be called the silence before the storm. The repair shops behind the Axis lines are reconditioning tanks. As long as General Rommel's tanks are not completely destroyed, the Egyptian crisis will not be eliminated.

Tanks Equipped with Large-Caliber Guns are Powerful Weapons

Havas News Agency, Berne, Switzerland, 10th. Military experts here recently stated that the current major battle in Egypt has changed the strategic use of tanks. Two years ago, when the desert war first broke out, both sides mostly viewed tanks as a kind of "modern cavalry" or used them as assault troops, but today they have long been transformed into a kind of mobile artillery battery. All tanks are equipped with large-caliber guns, with gunners concealed behind armor, providing comprehensive protection, which is incomparable to ordinary field guns that can only operate in strongly fortified positions. Therefore, large-caliber guns on tanks occupy a most important position in modern warfare. The German adoption of heavy tanks is for this reason. As for light tanks, they can only be used to protect heavy tanks, serving an auxiliary function. In addition, the air force also occupies an extremely important position in the desert war. Dive bombers are the most powerful weapon in modern warfare. They can be divided into two groups during operations. The first group carries out bombing missions, while the second group patrols the sky to protect the first group of aircraft. After a considerable period of time, the second group is transferred to the front line for bombing, while the first group of aircraft is recalled to the rear. This rotation can be carried out continuously from morning to evening, constantly bombing airfields, barracks, and tank repair factories. However, according to Cairo sources, Britain has recently concentrated a large number of aircraft in Egypt, gaining air superiority. However, British military officials believe that the difficult phase of the Egyptian war has not yet passed.

Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 11th. The German High Command announced yesterday that on Thursday, British positions in the desert area near El Daba, a water source between the Egyptian coast and the Qattara Depression, were repeatedly subjected to German air raids. British heavy artillery and infantry in the trenches suffered heavy casualties. German aircraft also carried out low-altitude attacks on British supply vehicles on the coastal highway, and a large number of vehicles caught fire and burned.

### British and American Nationals in Egypt Ordered to Evacuate

Allied News Agency, Lisbon, 11th. Today, news from Cairo via Istanbul stated that British nationals in Egypt who do not have an urgent reason to remain in the country have all received orders to evacuate Egypt. The Union of South Africa has begun to make arrangements to accommodate British nationals evacuated from Egypt. Approximately 4,000 British nationals in Egypt will be affected by the evacuation order. It is also reported that the American authorities have issued an evacuation order to American nationals in Egypt. Copts and Jews have begun to evacuate from Egypt.

### Italian Minister of Trade Riccardi Returns to Rome

Havas News Agency, Rome, 10th. Italian Minister of Foreign Trade Riccardi recently visited Germany, where he consulted with German economic leaders on trade issues between the two countries. Several new agreements have been reached. Having completed his mission, he returned here today. It is reported that the outcome of the talks proves that both sides wish to stabilize prices and currency values.

### Ancient and Modern Arabia (5)

Two Dynasties

After the death of Muhammad, the political, religious, and military leadership of Arabia was passed on to his great disciples. These successors were called Caliphs (representatives of the prophet) instead of prophets. The first Caliph was Muhammad's father-in-law, Abu Bakr. The second Caliph was Muhammad's favorite disciple, Umar. The third Caliph was Uthman, a member of the Umayyad clan in Mecca. The fourth Caliph was Muhammad's son-in-law, Ali. They all took Medina as their capital. Under their leadership, the power of the Islamic state expanded outwards, while the Romans and Persians continued their struggles.

Under the organization and leadership of these Caliphs, the Arabs conquered various regions and established a great Arab empire. They captured Syria in 635, Palestine in 638, then the mountainous region of Armenia in Asia Minor. They entered Egypt in 646, captured Cyprus in 649, and then advanced westward along the coast of North Africa, from Egypt to Tripoli (now Libya), then Tunisia, Algeria, and Morocco, bringing the Berber and Moorish peoples of North Africa into the embrace of Islam. In 712, they crossed the Strait of Gibraltar and arrived on the Iberian Peninsula, sweeping away the Visigothic tribal kingdom. From there, they advanced north almost to the plains of France. Advancing eastward, they entered Mesopotamia in 637 and completely conquered the New Persian Kingdom in 650. Thus, by the centennial of Muhammad's death (731), this great Arab empire stretched from the banks of the Indus River in the east to the Atlantic coast in the west, from the Arabian Sea in the south to Asia Minor in the north. In this great empire, the Arabs, needless to say, held all military and political power. However, they were relatively tolerant of religious beliefs, allowing people to accept Islam voluntarily. This is contrary to the general historical narrative that Muhammad held a sword in one hand and the Quran in the other to forcibly spread Islam.

The fifth Caliph created a new dynasty name, simply called Caliph, did not obey the established rules of selection, but wanted to exclusively own the title of Caliph with the new precedent of father to son inheritance. This Caliph was called the Umayyad Dynasty, and its capital was moved from Medina to Damascus in Syria. This new Caliphate Dynasty, which was passed down through generations, lasted for nearly a hundred years (661-749) before a revolution occurred. The great Islamic empire began to split. In this divided Islamic empire, the Turkic people of Central Asia, through a process of gradual infiltration, replaced the Arabs in leading the Islamic movement. The glory of the Arab people gradually faded.

The revolution occurred in 750 AD. In that year, a descendant of Muhammad's close relative, Abbas, rose up and overthrew the Umayyad Dynasty, which had held the Caliphate for a hundred years, and established a new dynasty - the Abbasid Caliphate - and the capital was moved from Damascus to Baghdad, on the lower Tigris River. As a result, the center of gravity of the Arab empire shifted to the east, and all aspects of life and customs gradually became easternized. The most famous Caliph in this new dynasty was Harun, who was contemporary with Charlemagne, the Frankish king of Europe. During Harun's reign, the Arabs' cultural and military achievements were very brilliant.

Unfortunately, the establishment of this new dynasty led to the great division of the Arab empire. The overthrown Umayyad family fled from Damascus, passed through North Africa, and escaped to the Iberian Peninsula. They were supported by the Moors and declared themselves Caliphs in 929, with Cordoba as their capital, ruling over the Iberian Peninsula. In Egypt, an Arab clan called the Fatimids (this clan was Muhammad's son-in-law's family) declared themselves Caliphs in 969 AD, with Cairo as their capital, ruling over all of North Africa. Thus, the Arab empire was divided into three centers, each hostile to the others, and each striving on its own. These three centers later failed to maintain overall unity. Local chieftains arose in each of their domains. For example, in the domain of the Abbasid Caliphate, the Seljuk Turks rose to power. The Arabs were on the decline there. The Abbasid Caliphate was completely destroyed in 1258, the Fatimid Caliphate was completely destroyed in 1517, and the Umayyad Caliphate on the Iberian Peninsula was destroyed by the Kingdom of Castile in northern Spain in the 14th century.

### Severe Cholera Outbreak: Decision to Re-implement Forced Vaccination; Two-Week Campaign to Begin on the 16th, and Sale of Raw Fish Will Be Prohibited

The oppressive heat in this city subsided slightly yesterday, and the wind was strong throughout the day. According to the observatory, the highest temperature yesterday was 92.7 degrees Fahrenheit (34 degrees Celsius), a decrease of two degrees compared to the previous day.

Lockdown and Disinfection in the Xiaodongmen District

According to a report from a Datong News Agency reporter, Huang Shunqing, a resident on the second floor of the Guohua Bank at No. 1 Xiaodongmen Main Street in the French Concession, also contracted cholera. After being sent to the Shanghai Epidemic Hospital and dying despite treatment, the French Concession Health Department dispatched eight health workers to the residence yesterday afternoon to carry out disinfection work. Xiaodongmen Main Street was temporarily closed from 3:00 PM to 5:00 PM, and the closure was lifted after the disinfection was completed.

Five New Cholera Cases

Among the inpatients at the Shanghai Epidemic Hospital, 13 cholera patients have been discovered one after another, and one person has died despite treatment. Five more cases have now been discovered (18 cases in total). The names, ages, and places of origin are listed below: Zhu Ayue, 4 years old, female, Shaoxing native, residing at No. 18 Jianqiao Bridge, Huining Road, Nanshi; Wei Abao, 12 years old, male, Wuxi native, residing at No. 80 Hongkou Road, Zhabei; Wang Zhengyi, 24 years old, male, Hangzhou native, residing at No. 2 Sian Lane, Gonghe Road, Zhabei; Shen Amao, 7 years old, female, Shaoxing native, residing at No. 526 Jianqiao Bridge, Huining Road, Nanshi; Wang Ye Shi, 25 years old, female, Ningbo native, residing at No. 86 Shipin Lane, Zhaojia Road, Nanshi.

Immunity Can Only Be Achieved Through Two Vaccinations

According to the Shanghai Times, it has been learned that the Shanghai Epidemic Prevention Committee met at the Xingya Institute office at 5:00 PM on Thursday and decided to conduct a second round of forced vaccinations in the city from July 16th to more effectively combat the epidemic. It was also disclosed that the sale of raw fish in stores and markets will be prohibited, as it is believed that the spread of the disease is partly due to the consumption of raw fish. The second vaccination will begin on July 16th and will last for two weeks. Two vaccinations are sufficient to prevent this rapidly spreading disease. Therefore, all Shanghai residents must receive their second vaccination before July 30th.

Prohibition of Raw Fish Sales is Necessary

Regarding the prohibition of raw fish sales, the Epidemic Prevention Committee believes that it is necessary. It has been found that fish, especially when eaten raw, is harmful to health in the summer. The Municipal Council will soon issue a notice implementing the second vaccination and prohibiting the sale of raw fish. There have been 14 cases of cholera in the past week, so the urgency of the second vaccination is self-evident. Yesterday, the French Municipal Council Health Department disclosed that a blind Chinese beggar in the French Concession died of cholera four days ago. This is the only case of cholera in the French Concession so far. It is believed that this beggar resided near the frequently-affected Nanshi, which led to the contraction of the disease.

### Dyed Yarn Black Market Completely Eliminated Yesterday; Telephones Have Been Cut Off, Markets No Longer Open; Spot Yarn Market Still Operating Normally

A Tongmeng News Agency report from this city states that the concession authorities, in view of rising prices being largely manipulated by speculative merchants, which is increasingly burdening the livelihood of the people, have strictly prohibited black market trading and hoarding to curb speculation and suppress prices. The rising trend has only slightly subsided. However, due to recent clandestine activities involving cash and futures trading in "Double Horse" brand yarn, the market situation has become tight again. In view of this, the Municipal Council has dispatched special agents to conduct strict investigations and crack down on speculative behavior in order to eliminate illegal trading. Speculators have been apprehended and are being punished. As a result, the market is increasingly panicked, and speculators dare not take risks. It is reported that as of yesterday, the 11th, black market trading in dyed yarn has been completely eliminated. Telephones have been cut off, and transactions cannot be conducted. Previous gathering places have been disbanded, and the "Double Horse" brand market has also temporarily suspended operations.

A Datong News Agency report states that the Shanghai Ningbo Road Tonghe Lane Yarn and Cloth Association, its second-floor meeting hall has long been engaged in the trading of "Double Horse" brand 20-count cotton yarn factory orders, while the ground floor has been engaged in spot trading of various brands of Chinese and Japanese cotton yarn. The second-floor factory order market has been particularly prosperous, being the largest speculative market in the city. All yarn firms and banks use its price fluctuations as a benchmark. However, due to the current circumstances, it will officially cease trading starting next Monday (tomorrow). All old transactions were settled clearly yesterday. The second-floor market premises will also no longer be open starting tomorrow, but the ground-floor spot market will continue to operate as usual.

### Second Ration Distribution to Begin Tomorrow Morning; Preparations for Next Month's Permit Issuance Soon to Commence

The second-term household rice rations submitted by rice shops in both concessions to the Municipal Council's Rice and Grain Management Committee were fully delivered yesterday morning. A total of 415 rice shops in the Public Concession received a total of 12,392 bags of white rice, 6,198 bags of broken rice, and 51,049 bags of flour. 214 rice shops in the French Concession received a total of 6,646 bags of white rice, 3,323 bags of broken rice, and 27,865 bags of flour.

Rice Shops Complete Delivery of Second-Term Rations

After the above rice and flour were delivered, all rice shops in both concessions have decided to begin selling on the morning of the 13th at 8:00 AM, based on the second stub of the rice purchase permit. Each rice purchase permit will entitle the holder to one "sheng" of white rice and half a "sheng" of broken rice, priced at 3.8 yuan in reserve currency, with a supplementary purchase of 1.5 "jin" of flour, priced at 3 yuan and 7 jiao in reserve currency. However, citizens are free to decline the supplementary purchase of flour. If both white rice and flour are purchased, the total cost will be 7 yuan and 5 jiao. Citizens must bring their own containers for the flour when purchasing to facilitate the process.

First Stub of Rice Permit to be Voided Today

Sales of household rice based on the first stub of the rice purchase permit ended at 6:00 PM yesterday. They cannot be used for purchase after today. As of 6:00 PM yesterday, rice shops had not sold all of their allocated household rice. It is understood that rice shops must report any remaining household rice to the authorities for verification in due course. The remaining household rice can only be stored in the shop. At the same time, those who have not received a rice purchase permit can apply for a replacement at the rice permit issuance offices. The deadline for replacement applications was also yesterday. Preparations for issuing August rice purchase permits will begin next week.

### Verdict on the Case of Cantonese Woman Chen Huangshi: Exemption from Punishment

Chen Huangshi, a Cantonese woman residing at No. 225 Gan Village, Gan Si Dong Road, had two sons and one daughter. Due to financial difficulties, Huangshi worked as a domestic helper at the home of her fellow villager, Lu Tianyou, at No. 370, Lane 3, Albert Road. She was falsely accused of theft and unjustly wronged. In her resentment, she returned home on the 25th of last month and purchased five yuan worth of coal briquettes. That evening, she lit the coal stove in the small pavilion, gathered her two sons, Guozhu (18 years old) and Guojun (9 years old), and her daughter, Cuixia, intending to end their lives together by suffocation. The following day, they were discovered by someone and sent to the hospital. The two sons could not be saved and died one after the other. Chen Huangshi and her daughter miraculously survived. The French police charged Chen Huangshi with inciting suicide and immediately interrogated her. The details have been reported in this newspaper. We now learn that the case was judged yesterday, and Chen Huangshi was exempted from punishment. A few days ago, Mr. Zhang Xiaosheng entrusted this newspaper to forward a savings certificate for one hundred yuan to Chen Huangshi for living expenses, which has already been reported. We have now received donations of ten yuan each from the mother of Mr. Pu Quting, as well as Mrs. Pu, Zou Yunyu, and the two young masters, Fu Kang and Jie Yuan, totaling forty yuan in savings certificates. This will also be delivered by a special messenger from this newspaper. Now that Chen Huangshi has been acquitted, she must find another means of livelihood to avoid further displacement.

### Grand Celebrations at Catholic Churches Across the City This Morning: Centenary of the Second Arrival of Jesuit Missionaries in China; Bishop Haou Presides Over Dedication of the Jiangnan Diocese

Since the arrival of Matteo Ricci in China in 1582 to preach Christianity, the Jesuit missionaries of the Catholic Church have had a glorious history of over three hundred years in contributing to Chinese society and culture. However, in the late eighteenth century, the Jesuit order was once suppressed, and the missionaries ceased coming to China. In 1814, after the Jesuit order was restored by order of the Pope in Rome, Chinese people, in memory of the legacy of Matteo Ricci, Johann Adam Schall von Bell and other pioneers who stayed in China, requested the Jesuit Superior General to send missionaries to China again to preach Christianity.

Two Priests Arrived in Shanghai a Hundred Years Ago Today

The first group of French priests, Fathers Placide Henri Nanquette and Édouard Estève, arrived safely in Shanghai on July 12, 1842.

### *Shen Bao*'s Third Scholarship Fund: Application Dates Determined; Starting from the 20th of This Month

The matters concerning the third scholarship fund of this newspaper have been underway for over a month since they were initiated. In the meantime, the fundraising for the fund, the revision of the regulations, the allocation of personnel, etc., have been generally completed. Yesterday, a meeting was held to discuss and decide on the following measures:

Application Forms Must Be Completed Carefully

Applications will begin on July 20th. Students applying for the scholarship must personally come to the office to obtain the forms starting from that date. Applications by letter will not be accepted. The forms must be completed carefully and submitted to the office as soon as possible. The filling of the forms must be detailed. Any forms that are careless or unclear will not be accepted.

List of Free Scholarships to Be Announced Soon

Letters from various primary schools, middle schools, and supplementary schools in this city donating free places have been pouring in, and their kindness is deeply appreciated. A list will be compiled and published in the newspaper after it has been organized so that admissions can be reviewed and recommended. Schools donating half-fee places will be politely declined due to the complicated procedures. Schools donating free places in summer schools will also be politely declined due to the limited time available to process them. Applicants for scholarships and the authorities of schools that are enthusiastically donating free places should be aware of these points.

Yesterday, the Zhonghua Company donated 1,000 yuan, and Mr. Li Zhiyang donated 20 yuan, totaling 1,020 yuan. The previous balance was 50,663 yuan and 44 cents. The total balance is 51,683 yuan and 44 cents.

The remaining 20 places will be selected from new students who apply to enter the special French language class in the Faculty of Science and Engineering. Approval of scholarship applications for new students will depend on their family circumstances and entrance examination results.

### A Brief Account of Mr. Jiang Weiqiao, the Promoter of Quiet Sitting

Jiang Weiqiao, also known as Yinshizi, has researched the method of quiet sitting for decades, earning fame and praise from the people of the country. However, he has never personally taught it. Now, he has established a Quiet Sitting Society to teach it publicly. Mr. Jiang has been harboring this intention for a long time but dared not be confident in the past, so he has been hesitant to act. Now that he has a little more confidence, he is trying it at the request of relatives and friends. Most of the students are from the business community, ranging in age from over sixty to around twenty. The classes last for two months, only four times a month. This short period is only for teaching the theory and method of quiet sitting. As for the benefits, they depend entirely on the self-cultivation of the students, without forgetting the heart or helping it. Success can only be achieved with years of effort. The most difficult thing to seek in quiet sitting is to relax the mind. The first thing to do is to focus the mind in one place and to use observation skills at all times. Mr. Jiang's body and mind seem to be getting healthier as he gets older. However, recently, due to too much work and excessive use of energy, he often suffers from insomnia. The Cheng Zheng Literary Society, which was reorganized at Guanghua University, originally had him as the chairman of the executive committee. From May of this year, he has resigned as chairman. Recently, it was reported that he was lecturing on Chinese cultural history at the summer study group in the Special Zone. According to Mr. Jiang, this was indeed the case, but I declined politely due to old age and failing spirit, for fear of summer heat, truthfully declining, and have been understood. However, the employer insisted on recommending a replacement. The next day, he obtained the consent of Mr. Yang Zhongyi and wrote a letter of recommendation. The other day, he saw Mr. Yang, who had already received the letter of appointment. The report in the newspapers may be based on hearsay. Mr. Jiang does not intend to take on any work other than promoting the method of quiet sitting in the next semester. He will close his doors to guests and engage in recuperation.

Yesterday, this newspaper issued the paper at 6 o'clock

The first match is between teammates of the women's group. The You team has many talented players, such as Zhang Jiapei, Yan Weiwen, Huang Mingyuan, Zhu Shifang, and Liu Zhenshi, all of whom are well-known in the gateball world and outstanding talents among the women's army.

All of the Lingsheng players are also as lively as dragons and tigers, with very high technical standards, and should not be underestimated. It is expected that the first battle between the two strong teams will be a lively performance. There are two matches in the men's group. Yaoguang and Huanan meet by chance. The two teams have each won once, and their strengths are equal. Yaoguang has gathered veteran players Wang Shoufang, Zhou Jun, and Zhang Jin, with the iron gate Dong Jincai guarding the gate. The defense is as solid as a rock. Huanan has recently dominated the basketball world and is invincible, seeming to have the aura of a hegemon. The momentum is unparalleled for a time. Today's battle with Yaoguang will surely have an earth-shattering and intense performance. The other men's group match is between Qiangxing and Nanyang. Although the latter is strong, it is predicted that the former will be able to pose a considerable threat. Tickets are one yuan, and the schedule is as follows:

### Preparing for Exams (3)

— Hu Zuyin

Maintaining Physical and Mental Health. This seems like a cliché, but examinees often fail to do it. People who "cram at the last minute" often study day and night, resulting in insufficient sleep and dizziness. On the day of the exam, they are listless or even too sick to take the exam. People who have prepared well can relax and rest a day or two before the exam, ready to face the exam. Therefore, examinees should prepare well in advance so that they can have adequate rest and sleep before the exam and be in a comfortable state in all aspects of their body.

Another point is to maintain mental health. Some people may have prepared well for the subjects they are going to take and maintain their health. But in terms of psychology, they have deep worries and fears. They worry about not being admitted, and they even have a kind of "inferiority complex," thinking that they are always inferior to others and that they will not be admitted this time. This kind of "inferiority complex" can sometimes cause examinees to lose confidence, so they hesitate about questions that can be answered or dare not confidently write down the answers, which will certainly affect their exam results. Therefore, before the exam, we must not only maintain our physical health but also pay attention to having a good and confident attitude psychologically.

Things to Note During the Exam

After an examinee has made adequate and proper preparations before the exam, he or she can confidently take the exam on the specified date. But there are still four things to note during the exam, which examinees should not ignore:

Understand the Questions. If you cannot understand the questions during the exam, you will often answer irrelevantly, working hard for nothing. Examinees should first read through all the questions briefly, paying attention to whether there are any areas they do not understand or questions they cannot answer at all. After reading through them briefly, carefully study each question. Some questions require detailed answers, while others can be briefly described. Some questions include two or three parts, and some questions require examples. After determining the nature and meaning of the questions, you can begin writing.

Start Writing. After understanding the questions, some examinees often sit in their seats, staring blankly at the paper. They hope that a kind of "inspiration" will arise in their minds and that they will be able to "write like a god." This kind of "dreaming" attitude is wrong because on the one hand, it can waste valuable exam time, and on the other hand, it can affect your efforts during the exam.

Therefore, after understanding the questions, you should form a proper answer in your mind. After the answer is formed, you should start writing. According to psychological research, mental activity often develops with the activity of the muscles of the body. During writing, the activity of the muscles of the hand can cause mental activity. The reason why many good ideas often naturally flow out when we write is this. Therefore, when we write, we should continue to write like a silkworm spinning silk. Sometimes, when writing the answer to the first question, you suddenly think of a good idea to answer the second or third question. At this time, you can temporarily stop writing and write down this valuable idea next to the relevant question to avoid forgetting it.

Manage Time. When answering questions, pay attention to how many questions there are and how much time there is, and then allocate the time appropriately. You can allocate the same amount of time to questions of comparable difficulty. You should leave more time to answer particularly difficult questions. If the exam paper does not specify that you must answer the questions in order, you can do the easy questions first and leave the difficult questions to the end, so that you can have enough time to think about the answers without affecting the answers to other questions.

Maintain Self-Confidence. As mentioned in the previous section, it is not advisable to worry or fear before the exam. During the exam, it is even more important to maintain self-confidence and take the exam calmly. If examinees can maintain a positive attitude and be confident that they have a hope of success in the exam, it can often help the development of thoughts and the completion of answers. With strong self-confidence, you can write calmly, and your thoughts will flow smoothly. Your comprehension and judgment will also be improved, and success in the exam can be considered as a matter of course. (End)

Family

### Essential Qualities of a Housewife

— Yun

Because a housewife manages the affairs of a family, her position in the family is very important. Fenny Hurst, the author of *Long Live Women*, once said, "If you educate a man, you only educate one person; if you educate a woman, you educate the whole family."

In recent years, many countries have paid close attention to preparing women for marriage and have set up home economics courses in schools. They teach sewing, cooking, family organization, child psychology, consumer issues, home furnishings, food and nutrition, and family management. Generally, it is believed that to be a successful housewife, one must have the following characteristics:

1.  Personal Hygiene: Because family hygiene must start with the individual, if the housewife herself does not have hygiene knowledge, then there is no way to talk about the hygiene of the whole family.

2.  Neat Appearance: This does not mean dressing luxuriously, only neatly, so it does not involve economic issues.

3.  Creative Spirit: A housewife must have a creative spirit for new home management methods, be brave in making improvements, and not stick to old rules.

4.  Forward-Looking Aspirations: Regardless of her past or current status, she must have forward-looking aspirations, so that she can make progress.

5.  Elegant Character: She must have an elegant character that makes people welcome, including good attitude, posture, etc.

6.  Noble Morality: She must have noble morality, so that she can be respected by others and serve as a role model for her children.

Being a housewife is really not an easy thing, and women who are already housewives can be proud of themselves.

### How to Raise an Infant

— Yingying

Raising a child is a seemingly easy yet difficult job. If a mother raises her infant properly, the infant will grow up healthy; otherwise, the infant may experience incomplete development or even die prematurely. This is something that must be paid attention to.

When it comes to childcare, the first and foremost thing is that the best food for an infant is the mother's milk. Unless there are special circumstances, a mother should breastfeed her own child and never hire a wet nurse or use cow's milk. Many women use cow's milk to feed their babies, which is very inappropriate. Mothers and nurses with some experience all know that infants cannot grow by eating cow's milk alone. We can compare cow's milk with human milk to understand this.

(A) Human milk has a neutral reaction, while cow's milk has an acidic reaction.

(B) Human milk does not contain bacteria, while cow's milk contains countless bacteria.

(C) If we calculate the composition of human milk as a percentage, it contains 3.3% fat, 0.7% protein, 0.8% casein, and 7.0% lactose. Cow's milk contains 3.5% fat, 0.7% protein, 2.8% casein, and 5.0% lactose.

Undoubtedly, the difference between human milk and cow's milk is significant. Commonly, cow's milk is diluted with water to feed infants, but this really cannot be considered a physiologically proper food for infants.

Originally, the composition of breast milk is suitable for the infant's digestion, without excessive richness or accumulation. There is nothing more exquisite and healthy than breast milk in the world. As for the method of breastfeeding, there must be a certain schedule. After each breastfeeding, a healthy mother must wait for more than two hours for the baby's stomach to empty. After emptying, the stomach needs to have a sufficient rest. Therefore, the interval between each breastfeeding should be at least three hours, such as breastfeeding at 6 am, 9 am, 12 pm, 3 pm, 6 pm, and 9 pm each day, for a total of six times, with rest at night. After one or two months, as the infant's milk intake gradually increases, the number of feedings can be reduced from six to five times, with an interval of four hours each time, such as breastfeeding at 6 am, 10 am, 2 pm, 6 pm, and 10 pm. During the day, if the infant is sleeping soundly, he should be awakened, but at night, the infant can be allowed to sleep. The time for each feeding should usually not exceed fifteen minutes. According to measurement, a healthy breastfed infant has already obtained at least three-quarters of its required milk volume within the first eight to ten minutes of breastfeeding, and the remaining one-quarter in the next five minutes. After each breastfeeding, the nipple and areola should be wiped clean with cotton gauze or cotton, and covered with a clean piece of cloth. To make the nipples smooth and prevent chapping, a small amount of petroleum jelly or lanolin can be applied to the nipples, and washed off with warm water before the next breastfeeding.

As for the breastfeeding period for infants, it is best to breastfeed until ten months. After one year, the mother's milk is not only insufficient for the infant's food needs, but also loses its nourishing effect, so breastfeeding must be stopped immediately. However, weaning should be implemented gradually and not abruptly, to prevent complications in the breastfed infant. If the mother is pregnant, then breastfeeding must be stopped, because the mother's milk is not enough for both the infant inside and outside the womb.

The above is about the method of breastfeeding for mothers. If the mother is unable to breastfeed the infant herself and must hire a wet nurse, then great care should be taken in the selection of the wet nurse. Even from the mother's personal convenience, hiring a wet nurse also involves many troubles. Before hiring, the wet nurse's health must be checked, and after hiring, it must be examined whether the infant's breastfeeding is appropriate.

The wet nurse's physique and blood must first be examined by a doctor. If proven qualified, then she can be hired. Because the wet nurse's milk is often not suitable for the infant, and if the wet nurse has a venereal disease, it is even more dangerous. Therefore, if she is not examined and casually hired to breastfeed, it will be detrimental to the infant's health. One more thing to pay attention to is that the wet nurse's infant should be about the same age as one's own infant. If they are too far apart, the milk may not be very suitable for the infant.

As for feeding cow's milk, attention must be paid to its cleanliness, and the ingredients fed must also be gradually increased according to the infant's age. There are three common types of using condensed milk to replace cow's milk: (A) containing milk whey and added sugar, (B) containing milk whey but no added sugar, and (C) with milk whey removed. Ultimately, its composition is similar to cow's milk, and no one type can be called a completely suitable food. Only the first two types can be used as part of the food for infants over six months old (those with milk whey removed are still unsuitable). Milk powder is really not easy to digest for infants under six months old, and forced feeding can easily cause illness. According to the experiments of doctors, infants after seven months can start using powder food for nourishment. Also, goat milk is also a very good nutrient for infants, and goats do not suffer from lung stimulant diseases, which makes it more beneficial than cow's milk.

Next, let's talk about supplementary foods for infants. After four or five months, in addition to breastfeeding, infants should also be given some vegetable juice, such as orange juice, every day. This kind of fruit juice should be diluted with boiled water. When squeezing oranges, hands must be washed clean to avoid contamination. As for infants after six or seven months, a little food can be added for them to eat. Infant food must be tender and easy to digest, and should be cooked until soft and hot before being given to them. The best vegetables for infants are spinach, turnips, sweet potatoes, and cabbage. However, these vegetables should not be cooked with oil, only a little salt is needed. Infants of ten months can be given thin porridge once a day, and noodles are also acceptable.

In addition, for raising infants, the following must be noted. Infants should have sufficient sleep, and it is best to let infants sleep on their own to avoid being disturbed. Also, infants must be bathed daily, and clothing and diapers must be washed and changed frequently to maintain cleanliness. It is also necessary to weigh the infant regularly, because the increase or decrease in weight is closely related to the infant's health. Most importantly, infants should not be allowed to be near patients, because infants have very weak constitutions and are easily infected with diseases.

All of the above are things that mothers must pay attention to. In short, for a mother to raise an infant, if she can do it according to the above methods, it will definitely be very beneficial to the health of the infant's body.

### Summer Nourishment of the Heart

— Jing

Nourishing the heart and cultivating the character is originally a very good thing, and it is even more suitable in summer. As the saying goes, "A calm heart naturally feels cool," so why not engage in the work of nourishing the heart? Below are maxims about nourishing the heart:

If the heart has principles, it will not be confused by heresies and miscellaneous sayings. If the heart has established knowledge, it will not be swayed by vulgar and shallow views.

The heart should not be narrow-minded. A narrow-minded heart invites much regret. The heart should not be procrastinating. A procrastinating heart thwarts many heroes.

The human heart values smallness. A small heart can accommodate the world. The human heart needs emptiness. An empty heart can embrace the world.

The heart of a sage is upright, grand, and luminous. The heart of a virtuous person is solemn and vigilant. The heart of the masses is humble, vulgar, and narrow-minded. The heart of a petty person is treacherous, cunning, and changeable.

The four words "respect, reverence, humility, and yielding" are the good of the heart, through which true nature can be seen. The four words "familiarity, contempt, arrogance, and negligence" are the evil of the heart, through which the conscience is obscured.

Everyone uses their heart, but fears using it for evil purposes. Everyone creates their heart, but fears creating an evil environment.

The heart is like a horse running on a plain, easy to release but difficult to restrain.

The heart is a god. Those who deceive their heart inevitably deceive the gods. The god is the heart. Those who deceive the gods inevitably deceive themselves.

An empty heart can respond to the affairs of the world. A selfless heart can convince the people of the world. An upright heart can subdue the things of the world. A clear heart can understand the principles of the world.

Once the heart is cold, the lively scenery cannot enter. Once the heart is detached, the glamorous objects cannot move it.

The human heart fears darkness. Mistakes should be corrected by calming the mind. When the mind is settled, one will gradually feel clarity.

The human heart must have city walls. If the heart has city walls, it will not go out. The mouth must have doors. If the mouth has doors, it will not be unrestrained.

The heart of a young person should be reserved and restrained, not unrestrained. The heart of an old person should be unrestrained, not suppressed.

### One Gain from Household Affairs

Removing rust from kitchen knives: Immerse in swill water for one or two days, then take out, and the rust will be removed by itself.

Mending woks: If there is a hole in the wok, mash raw pig liver and apply it, which is no different from mending with iron.

Porridge: When cooking porridge from rice, add a spoonful of lemon juice to make the color pure white and the aroma strong.

White rice: When cooking rice, you can also add a little lemon juice to the water, which will make the rice cleaner, whiter, and fluffier.

Cold rice: In summer, spread fresh amaranth or fresh lotus leaves on cold rice, so it will not spoil overnight.

Washing glass bottles: Do not discard eggshells. Crush them into pieces and use them to wash glass bottles, without the need for laborious picking, and able to scrape away dirt and polish.

### The Foundation for Success in Career

— Piaoping

Little friends! You are now in the time of study. When you grow up in the future, you must come to society to do something. Doing business requires a good foundation of knowledge and morality. The more deeply rooted the foundation is, the greater the hope of success in the future. So when we are laying the foundation, do we want to make it stronger and deeper? If we don't lay the foundation now, then it will probably be too late to lay it when we grow up. So now I would like to discuss with you the basic conditions for laying the foundation:

1.  Manners: Manners include respect, dignity, and neatness. Whether it is to superiors or inferiors, to the poor or the rich, you must have the same manners.

2.  Loyalty: Loyalty means not being hypocritical, not perfunctory, and not forgetting your roots. Treat people with loyalty and speak honestly.

3.  Humility: In everything, you must be cautious. If you only know a little and act rashly, it is easy to fail. You should study more, ask for advice diligently, and always keep a little "humility," and doing things will be much easier. 4. Endurance of hardship: Having the spirit of hard work and endurance is a great "capital" for reading and doing things.

4.  Persistence: In addition to enduring hardship, you must also have perseverance. It is most taboo to start things and not finish them, and to be inconsistent.

5.  Enterprising: In the past, people in our country mostly advocated conservatism and did not know how to be enterprising. Therefore, the development of all industries has fallen behind others. In this great era, we must have the spirit of seeking progress in everything.

### Health Exercise Method (3)

There are a total of twenty-seven types of Mc's health exercises, with one to nine as the first group, which will be completed in this issue. The second group will be published in the next issue (i.e., the tenth to the nineteenth style and the third group (i.e., the twentieth to the twenty-seventh style).

When practicing, in the first week, you should complete the first group every day. In the second week, you should do from the first style to the nineteenth style every day, that is, combine the first and second groups. In the third week, you must complete the whole set, that is, from the first to the twenty-seventh. However, according to this method, if you feel that you are not very proficient in a certain style, or that it is a bit laborious, it is better to adopt a gradual approach, and never practice beyond your physical strength, because "gradual" is really a stable and effective method. Although its progress is relatively slow, its effect is the same as that of people who progress quickly. Therefore, people with poor physical strength should not rush to do the latter style before they have mastered the previous one.

Health exercise is a good exercise suitable for every member of the family. Once started, it should be treated as a daily homework, and it cannot be interrupted for a day. When doing it, it is certainly not appropriate to practice excessively, but for some seemingly simple and easy styles, do not lightly ignore them, because this simple style may be part of its characteristics. As for sweating from exercise or gymnastics, it has long been generally recognized as beneficial to health. Therefore, if you feel that sweating is not very pleasant when doing health exercises, you may wish to look at the climate and wear more clothes to help with sweating, but you must know that exercise is more important than sweating, so whether sweating is pleasant is a secondary issue!

(Figure 7) Lie flat on your body, stretch your arms over your head, put your palms together, as shown in the picture, lift your upper body, make a sitting posture, do not bend your knees, try to touch your toes with your fingertips, repeat six times. The count should be based on each time the fingertips touch the toes. This is an old-fashioned method, but it is still one of the most beneficial exercises for the body, because its effect directly reaches the abdominal muscles and internal organs. It can be said to be one of the most effective standard exercises for restraining the abdomen and preventing it from becoming a protruding belly.

(Figure 8) Lie flat on your body, stretch your arms and legs straight, put your palms together, lift your feet, as shown in the picture, open your arms and legs and return to the original state, repeat six times. The count should be based on each time the arms and legs are closed. When doing it for the first time, it should be a little slow, and the arms and legs should be opened as much as possible before closing them. This allows the buttocks, shoulders, and thighs to have a balanced opportunity to move, and the chest can be expanded to increase its breathing volume.

(Figure 9) Lie flat on your body, stretch your arms and legs straight, put your palms together, lift your feet, as in Figure 8, cross your arms and legs, first with the right arm and right leg on top, then switch to the left arm and left leg, rotate six times, the count should be based on each time the right arm and right leg are on top.

According to the flat style principle and purpose, it is the same as the eighth style, but the movements are opposite, so that the same muscle tendon is extended on the opposite side. Just practice skillfully, it is very helpful for the overall balanced development and blood circulation. The movements of this style and the eighth style should be slow and orderly, and do not use excessive force. (End of the first group)

### One Issue of Regular Star Family Dishes

Winter melon soup has always been the most fashionable delicacy in summer, but chicken, duck, fish, and meat are inevitably too expensive. It costs a lot to eat a winter melon soup. Why not have a vegetarian one? Fortunately, ingredients such as sharp bamboo shoots, fragrant mushrooms, pickled mustard greens, green vegetables, green peppers, Beijing pickled mustard greens, and Sichuan pickled mustard greens can all be accommodated. As long as the seasoning is proper, it is also delicious and palatable.

### A Vanity-Loving Fiancée

— Lu

Dear Editor: It was the strict order of my parents, and also with my consent, that I got engaged to her. She has a clever tongue and a generous demeanor, and even more so a pleasing face. She can make gloomy people smile again. However, from my observation, from the words of third parties, I know that she loves vanity. She once did not speak to her mother for a week because her mother did not make her new clothes. She once did not go to class because she did not have a handbag. She once sold her ring to treat her classmates to dinner. This is such a terrible event. If her degree of vanity increases with time, then what extent will she reach after we get married? Will she quarrel with me over making new quilts? Will she be unhappy with me over buying silk fabrics? Will she...? I dare not think about these many things. The time to leave the wedding is getting closer and closer. I don't know if her vanity will disappear because she leaves school, or if it will be destroyed because of marriage. I really don't know how to deal with it.

Lu: Your fiancée's vanity may be due to being pampered at home, or to the fact that her companions' actions are too focused on luxury. It is impossible to hope that her vanity will be destroyed immediately after she gets married. This can only be gradually done to prevent her from having a baseless impression. Don't be discouraged, don't be disappointed. If you have deep love, correct her personality, but it must not be done too hastily, so as not to backfire. Editor

### Public Bonds Gradually Show Signs of Recovery

Yesterday's dark market for public bonds showed a slight rebound after a long period of fatigue. This was due to the exhaustion of floating positions, some short covering, and the emergence of new long positions. Market prices immediately rose, and the long-dormant situation saw a slight awakening. The trend also gradually shows signs of excitement, with the usual pattern of a surge on rises and a gradual decline on falls. The prospect is that public bonds may be exempt from the case of control, and continued rises are also expected. Although trading was not high yesterday, market prices gradually rose, and the results all rose by 50 cents to 1.20 yuan, with a transaction volume of about 600,000 to 700,000 yuan. A brief table is listed below.

### The Rise of Electrical Stocks Has Slightly Stabilized

Yesterday's stock market in China showed steady progress. New pharmaceutical and cultural stocks rose. The recently soaring Hebei Water and Electricity and Huashang Electrical stocks turned weak, and the same was true for the stability of the department store industry. Speculators' funds have been transferred to legitimate investments. The prices of each stock are more likely to rise and difficult to fall. The prices of each stock market are recorded below.

### Japanese Military Tickets Again Used for Cigarette Payment

Yesterday, the call rate of the Money Industry Association was 15 points. Newly drawn head bills were still exchanged at par with cash.

### Edible Oil Raw Materials Gradually Arriving

The raw materials for manufacturing edible oil are now being shipped to Shanghai in a steady stream. Recently, 3,000 packages of raw peanuts have been shipped. There are also soybeans, rapeseed, and cottonseed, which are also continuing to arrive in Shanghai. Therefore, the output of this factory is increasing day by day. The wholesale department of the edible oil industry distributes about 1,000 dan per day, which is more than enough to supply the city's consumption. However, recently, a group of speculators have secretly raised prices for sale. I hope that citizens will not be fooled by them. If there are users who need more, they can directly request to purchase from the edible oil office in the Enterprise Building.

### Dried Sweet Potatoes Not Actively Sold

A small amount of dried sweet potatoes has arrived. Although the actual sales are not active, the market situation is still stable. It is estimated that 30 packages of dried sweet potatoes from Qingdao are priced at 117 yuan, and 25 packages of dried sweet potatoes from Jiangbei are priced at 104 yuan.

### The Soybean Cake Market Is Quiet

The soybean trade turned quiet again yesterday. Only ten bags of Benniu red beans were traded, priced at 130 yuan. The potential is still firm.

The sales of soybean cake are mediocre. The owners of the goods are still determined to sell, so the situation is tight. It is estimated that 500 pieces of new Lizi cake for May are priced at 57.5 yuan, 300 pieces of old Xingji cake for June are priced at 51.5 yuan, and 1,000 pieces of new cake for May are priced at 59 yuan to 58.9 yuan.

### The Cloth Industry Is Watching and Trading Is Sparse

Yesterday, the cloth market was quiet due to the wait-and-see attitude of both buyers and sellers. The trading was sparse and the market showed no signs of improvement. The closing price of 12-pound Nengtou fine cloth new orders was 194.5 yuan, bank orders were 168.5 yuan, Caiqiu fine cloth was trading at 176 yuan, and Sijunzi Bilji red orders were 7.54 yuan. The factory cloth transaction was even more idle. 16-pound Earth coarse cloth was 185 yuan, and Xiahong was 182 yuan. Changshoufu silk was 6.25 yuan and had a transaction. Biyushu Xiang was 6.2 yuan, Qin Liangyu bleached cloth was 160 yuan, Xiaoji Shilin was 265 yuan, Qin Meiren grey cloth was 238 yuan, and Taohua NV Shilin was last priced at 278 yuan.

### The Factory's Woolen Fabrics Are Unique in the Market

Imported woolen fabrics have been in short supply since the European War, and were completely cut off when the Pacific War broke out. The only products circulating in the market are those produced by this factory. Later, due to the shortage of raw materials, high prices, and rising water and electricity costs, production was restricted, and the production volume also decreased. However, looking at the buying and selling in the market, 70-80% are products of this factory, which occupies the most advantageous position. Broadly speaking, it can be divided into three major systems: British-owned Yihua Factory, with the largest scope and the most products, has now been taken over; Japanese-owned Yongxing Hongkang, Shanghai, and Gongda, etc.; Chinese-owned Zhanghua, Xiexin, Yinfeng, Weiyi, Dalong, Hualun, Yuanfeng, Deda, Runfeng, Dalu, Daguangming, etc., and Baoxin, Lianxin, Gongping, Hongsheng, Datong, Baochang, Rentai, Shanghai, Yousheng, and Gongsheng, etc., which are used for weaving yarn and lining suits.

### Miscellaneous Business News

Raw Sugar Stock Steady, Red Sugar Untraded: Yesterday, the sugar merchants' cooperative business office's sugar stock and the guild's transactions remained sparse and the market remained stable. Initially, it rose by half a dollar, but then returned to level, resulting in no rise or fall. Raw sugar stock opened at $317.50 and closed at $317, with approximately 400 bags traded. Red sugar stock was mutually shunned and no trades were made.

Black Leaf Litchi Newly Arrived, Seventy Crates: The first batch of Guangdong black leaf litchi, totaling more than seventy crates, has arrived at Fushang and other firms in the North Market. This year's yield is excellent, with both appearance and color being superior, comparable to Jinshan litchi. However, there are occasional burnt particles in the flesh, due to over-roasting, which is not a serious problem. Yesterday, sales commenced, with round litchi priced at $800 and flat litchi at $850.

First Batch of New Dried Vegetables Arrives in Nanjing and Zhenjiang: The first batch of new dried vegetables, according to telegrams from Nanjing and Zhenjiang, has arrived in small quantities. Dried vegetables from Xuzhou opened at $380 in the Beijing market, while those from Huaibei opened at $420 to $400 in the Zhenjiang market, with the next grade at $380. Prices are generally stable. It is noted that the original products all require sorting and culling, and as existing stock is not moving, merchants here have little interest. Therefore, the initial market price of new dried vegetables will not be excessively high.

Alisma Rhizome Expensive, Costs High: Stocks of alisma rhizome in the market are very scarce. It is heard that the Jianbang firm has transported dozens of packages, including large and small grains, as well as double blooms. Due to high transportation costs, the cost is not low, so the opening price is higher than the market price, resulting in no transactions.

Cigarette Inventory Abundant, Floating Traders Selling Off: The cigarette market continues to be weak, with sales to customers and within the industry remaining smooth. Due to abundant inventory, floating traders are selling off, so the market sentiment is more inclined towards selling than buying. Yesterday, Grandee brand opened at $8550, Old Sword brand at $5300, and Pin Hai brand at $4600, all down by $100. Miscellaneous brands were at $3650, and Wu Hua brand at $3550, holding steady.
