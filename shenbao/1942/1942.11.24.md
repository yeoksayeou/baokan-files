### German and Italian Forces Occupy Key Points on Algerian Border, Strengthening Control Over Bizerte

Lisbon, 23rd (Allied News Agency) - According to Axis sources, the British and American invading forces in Tunisia are advancing in three directions, north, central, and south of the French protectorate. German and Italian vanguards advancing towards the Tunisian-Algerian border have occupied several key points. While the Allied forces offered some resistance, the Italian and German sides are continuously sending reinforcements to strengthen their control over Bizerte, an important naval base in Tunisia. A major battle is brewing west of this base. The Axis spearhead encountered only slight resistance from American and British troops as it advanced. Other British and De Gaulle forces are avoiding contact with the Axis forces. With their advance secured, the Axis forces can now discern the British strategy in Tunisia, which appears to be to concentrate the forces of four columns and advance in three main directions. German air reconnaissance on Sunday obtained valuable intelligence about the movements of General Anderson's First Army and the American forces. The majority of American forces seem to be concentrated in southern Tunisia. The northernmost column of the Allied forces, composed of units from the British First Army, is moving along the coast towards Tunis and Bizerte. German General Nehring is deploying large squadrons of aircraft, tanks, and airborne infantry to counter the British advance. Earlier Allied reports stated that elite Allied forces west of Tunis were attacking German forces at a crossroads, and that patrols from both sides clashed about thirty miles from Bizerte. However, this report did not mention any Allied progress, so it is generally believed that the Axis defenses are strong and unaffected by the Allied forces. The second Allied column, composed of two detachments, is advancing in central Tunisia towards the east coast of Tunisia. The third Allied column in the south, consisting mostly of American troops, is advancing towards the Mediterranean port of Gabes (approximately 170 miles south of Tunis), starting from their base at Fleyyana, about 150 miles southwest of Tunis, towards the Gafsa line. However, according to Axis sources, these Allied forces have not yet invaded beyond the border areas, and the scope of air operations by the British and American forces has been reduced. Axis air attacks, on the other hand, have intensified. German and Italian air forces have heavily attacked British tank vanguards along the northern coastal road of Tunisia, inflicting heavy damage. German air forces also bombed several airfields in the coastal areas of Bone and Algiers with considerable success. German dive bombers destroyed ten American Flying Fortress aircraft and several other aircraft in these attacks. A fire broke out at an airfield near Algiers after a German air raid, destroying hangars and other equipment.

Tangier, 23rd (Reuters) - Neutral observers here say that the various reports regarding the situation in North Africa are contradictory, with only one point in common: that both sides continue to concentrate their troops and actively improve supply facilities. According to Radio Morocco, German forces have crossed the Tunisian border at several points and are advancing towards Kasserine and Kairouan. Minor skirmishes have occurred between the forces of both sides near the border. British reports state that the Allied forces advancing along the FÃ©riana-Kasserine railway intend to reach the eastern coast of the Mediterranean. British reports also stated that the Allied forces are consolidating their positions between Kairouan and Sousse, but it was not specified whether this was for defensive or offensive purposes.

Tangier, 23rd (Reuters) - A report from Algiers states, "Axis aircraft bombed again this morning." The extent of the damage to the city has not been revealed.

Tangier, 23rd (Reuters) - Algiers reports that Axis air forces attacked Algiers three times yesterday. As of last night, the city had experienced thirteen air raids.

### Soviet Forces Engage in Fierce Fighting with German Forces on the East Bank of the Don River

Lisbon, 23rd (Allied News Agency) - According to reports from Moscow, Soviet forces have been engaged in fierce fighting with German forces since yesterday around Kalach-na-Donu and Abkhazskiy, south of Stalingrad, on the east bank of the Don River.

Stockholm, 23rd (Allied News Agency) - According to sources from Berlin, Soviet troops have indeed launched offensives northwest and south of Stalingrad in the hope of relieving the crisis in the Caucasus. The offensive is commanded by Lieutenant General Romanenko, with the aim of reaching the Don River bend south of Stalingrad and the Kalmyk Steppe south of the lower Volga River.

Stockholm, 22nd (Havas News Agency) - According to German official sources, the German High Command is not surprised by the Soviet offensive inside and outside Stalingrad. The German Air Force was well prepared for this, so the Soviet forces did not achieve significant results. The fighting is currently most intense in the area of ââKachalinskaya and the area from Tsimlyanskaya to Krasnoarmeysk, south of Stalingrad. The Soviet forces are trying to tie down as many German troops as possible inside and outside Stalingrad to prevent them from reinforcing other lines. In addition, Soviet cavalry is also very active in the Kalmyk Steppe. However, according to German sources, the fighting has not yet reached its peak, and the final outcome is difficult to determine. As for the Soviet forces on the Caucasus front, they are attacking in the areas of ââTuapse, Alagir, and Mozdok, but the German forces are able to control the overall situation and are still holding their original positions. The German side has firmly denied the Soviet claim that the Red Army achieved a major victory in Ordzhonikidze on the 19th and 20th of this month, stating that only the fighting near Terek is intense, which is a fact. As for the situation in other areas of the Eastern Front, there is no accurate news yet. It is only known that the Soviet forces are continuing their counter-offensive in the areas of ââRzhev and west of Moscow. The Soviet forces near Leningrad are also attempting to cross the Neva River, but they have been repelled by German forces.

Berlin, 22nd (Havas News Agency) - The High Command recently announced: (1) On the Eastern Front, in the Nalchik area, German and allied forces attacked in the foothills east of the city, driving the Red Army out of its fortified positions and capturing a large amount of supplies. (2) In the Terek area, two enemy units were encircled and annihilated. Our forces attacked the enemy's flank, inflicting heavy casualties on the Red Army. (3) South of Stalingrad and in the Don River bend, defensive battles are ongoing. As a result of a German-allied counter-attack, 600 Red Army soldiers were captured and 22 tanks and 36 motorcycles were destroyed. The German Air Force contacted the army and attacked the enemy's tank concentration points, infantry units moving up, and supply units. Our assault troops occupied new positions in Stalingrad and repelled the Red Army in several locations. (4) In the Voronezh area, an enemy assault unit was annihilated. (5) On the northern front, southeast of Lake Ilmen, enemy forces launched repeated local attacks, all of which were repelled after fierce fighting. The enemy's attempt to cross the Neva River was thwarted by concentrated German artillery fire. The German dive bombers bombed the Murmansk Railway.

### Deputy Director of the Japanese Information Bureau, Okumura, Delivers Speech

Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency) - Okumura, the Deputy Director of the Japanese Information Bureau, delivered a speech entitled "The Bloody Battle of Sonno Joi" at the 22nd Youth Memorial Day Commemoration Ceremony held at the Japanese Youth Hall at 7:20 PM on the 22nd. The Tokyo Central Broadcasting Station simultaneously broadcasted the speech. The main points of the speech are as follows: "The Greater East Asia War is by no means a war fought solely for Japan, but a war fought for the 1 billion people of all Asia. As the slanderous words of various countries towards us say, Asia, although its history is long, does not have an Asian history. It is a Western European history and the history of England and the United States. Beginning with the Opium War a hundred years ago, after they achieved their ambition to invade China, they further wanted to invade Japan. England and France in the south, Russia in the north, and the United States in the east pressed in on each other. At this time, Japan's fate was like a candle in the wind, but the righteous spirit of our Japan finally led to the overthrow of the shogunate, which was unable to resolve the national crisis, and the completion of the great task of the Meiji Restoration. Since our Emperor took control of political affairs, the Western European ambition to invade Japan was swept away. The Meiji Restoration was actually the first shot to defend Asia. The invasion of Japan by British and American forces has been broken, and Asia can avoid being conquered. It is because of the Sonno Joi advocated by the patriots with their blood that Asia was able to be defended and Japan was able to be protected. The Sonno Joi spirit is the spirit of the Meiji national polity, the spirit of restoration based on the imperial way, and the Sonno Joi spirit is also the spirit that has permeated the hearts of the Japanese people since the Meiji Restoration. Therefore, what the Greater East Asia War, which is to destroy England and the United States, is praying for, is also rooted in the Sonno Joi spirit of eighty years ago. At the time of the Meiji Restoration, the US President was Fillmore. If we try to look at the instructions of the US President at that time and the reports sent back to his country by Perry from Ryukyu, we will immediately understand that this conquest was actually for the purpose of invading Japan. The Greater East Asia War is a struggle between the Japanese worldview and the British and American worldview, and also a struggle between the Japanese view of history and the British and American view of history. In recent times, we Japanese must stop observing Asian history with an American or British standard and deeply observe it with the heart of the Japanese and the heart of the Asian. The previous world was only limited to England and the United States. Other ethnic groups, especially people of color, were regarded as inferior races. The history they compiled took this as a prerequisite and erased the contributions of Asians, who created the world's three major religions based on European material civilization. They, with the Anglo-Saxons being the darlings of heaven, reorganized world history. We must never observe history with the hearts of the British and Americans. The Sino-Japanese War was by no means a war between Japan and China. When we observe it correctly with a historical perspective, this Sino-Japanese War was already a war between England and Japan. England used the Korean issue as an opportunity to instigate the Qing Dynasty from behind, so at that time, England had already become an opponent. Until this Sino-Japanese Incident, since the outbreak of the Lugouqiao Incident, England has been Japan's true enemy. This is not just my own judgment. The American historian Adams, who has repeatedly commented on East Asian issues, also said long ago that the Russo-Japanese War can be said to be a sacred undertaking to defend Asia by reducing Russia from the north. This is already a well-known fact. Japan's defeat of Russia, the world's first-class continental military power, not only made the world admire and submit, but also made 1 billion Asians have unlimited aspirations and respect for Japan. The construction of Greater East Asia has been the long-cherished wish of Asian countries for more than 30 years. During the First World War, Japan participated in the Allied side's operations based on the friendship of the Anglo-Japanese Alliance. Japan's participation in the war greatly helped the Allied victory, but what Japan got in return was the cold and rude reward of England and the United States, namely the Versailles Conference and the Washington Conference. Therefore, the humiliation of the Washington Conference more than 20 years ago is the root cause of this Greater East Asia War. At that time, China saw Japan submit to England and the United States and regarded Japan as weak, so it was natural to lean on England and the United States to try to restore its national rights. It goes without saying that the mistakes and miscalculations of Chinese politicians are just right to give England and the United States, who are attempting to squeeze and invade Asia, convenience. Therefore, the true enemies of the Manchurian Incident and the Sino-Japanese Incident are England and the United States. The Greater East Asia War occurred because of this, so the war to revive Asia and build Greater East Asia is also the bloody battle of Sonno Joi. The Meiji Restoration was completed by young patriotic men, and the final battle to build Asia must also be completed by you, the young patriotic men."

### German Air Force Active in Libya, Bombing British Transportation Lines, British Forces Have Great Difficulty Supplying Due to Destruction of Coastal Ports, Progress Slowed

Berlin, 23rd (Reuters) - According to reports last night, Marshal Rommel, with the assistance of the German Air Force, has intensified air raids against enemy activities, inflicting significant losses on the transportation lines and supply stations of the British Eighth Army. The German air raids on British military camps near Bardia and supply stations near Tobruk were particularly successful. German and Italian armored forces have new weapons suitable for desert warfare. According to reports from German reconnaissance aircraft, the British Eighth Army is marching infantry along the Libyan coastal highway. Enemy forces are scattered over a wide area from the Egyptian border to Benghazi, making their supply very difficult. Before withdrawing, the Axis forces completely destroyed the port facilities, so the port can now only be used by smaller ships. The British repair work in Tobruk was also hindered by the Japanese Air Force. The Japanese aircraft sank two enemy ships during the air raids on Tobruk.

### 100,000 Tons of French Ships Rumored to Have Been Scuttled

Tangier, 23rd (Reuters) - It was learned here last night that French sailors loyal to Vichy have scuttled approximately 100,000 tons of French ships anchored in Casablanca and other North African ports to prevent them from falling into British and American hands.

### Cripps Appointed Minister of Aircraft Production, Post of Speaker of the House of Commons Concurrently Held by Eden

Lisbon, 23rd (Allied News Agency) - According to an official announcement from London, Lord Privy Seal Cripps has been appointed Minister of Aircraft Production, and his vacancy will be concurrently held by Minister of Public Security Morrison. The original Minister of Aircraft Production, Llewellin, has been appointed Military Supplies Commissioner to Washington. The post of Speaker of the House of Commons will be concurrently held by Foreign Minister Eden. Colonial Secretary Cranborne will be transferred to Lord Privy Seal, and the post of Colonial Secretary will be succeeded by Stanley. Regarding the reason for Cripps' withdrawal from the War Cabinet, the British side only stated that Cripps will be solely responsible for the technical matters of the Aircraft Production Department.

Stockholm, 22nd (Havas News Agency) - According to news from London, Sir Stafford Cripps, Lord Privy Seal and Government Representative of the House of Commons, is about to be transferred to Minister of Aircraft Production and will therefore lose his qualification as a member of the Central Cabinet. Regarding this matter, Prime Minister Churchill sent a letter to Sir Stafford Cripps on the 19th of this month, stating, "As a result of the current war development, the production of aircraft and the development of wireless technology have become one of the greatest factors in our victory. This is extremely obvious. I think it is desirable that you prepare to accept the position of Minister of Aircraft Production. The country must gain great contributions. This seems to lower your current status at first glance, but I believe you will not mind this at all. Not only that, but the degree of cooperation between you and me after you take office in the new position can be even closer than before, because I also hold the position of Minister of Defense. No matter what your final decision is, I hope you will carefully consider this suggestion to serve the country in an advanced way." Cripps immediately replied, "I completely obey the dispatch of your office and the country. I will listen to your decision on where I can exert the greatest effort. I am prepared to accept the new position you have given me. Because I believe that the Aircraft Production Department is an affiliated agency of the Supply Department, I will no longer remain a member of the Cabinet of Ministers. I hope that after I take office in the new position, I can continue the close cooperation with the public for several months and can fulfill the expectations of the motherland and your office with joy and without failure."

### The World Situation and the East Asian Axis

â Foreign Minister Chu's Radio Address

It will soon be the second anniversary of the conclusion of the Sino-Japanese Treaty on the Adjustment of National Relations and the publication of the Sino-Japanese-Manchukuo Joint Declaration. In these two years, despite the tumultuous international situation and its many changes, the East Asian axis has become increasingly consolidated, and the new world order has become more concrete. This is what we feel most comforted and delighted about as we commemorate the treaty and the joint declaration today. I would like to take this commemorative opportunity to speak about the world situation and the progress of the East Asian axis.

The British and American imperialists have long roamed the world, plundering its resources and exploiting the colonial peoples to satisfy their insatiable desires. This behavior of Britain and America has become even more rampant and tyrannical since the First World War. The facts are so numerous that it would be impossible to list them all. What we should pay attention to here is that the British and American imperialists, in order to maintain their system of aggression and to dream of perpetually plundering and exploiting the world, do not hesitate to use all kinds of vicious methods to realize their ambitions. What are these methods? First, they use diplomatic and political means to disguise their aggressive behavior, so that the nations oppressed by them cannot recognize their true, hideous faces. For example, the League of Nations, the Kellogg-Briand Pact, the Stimson Doctrine, etc., were all manufactured from this model. Even the recent British and American abolition of extraterritoriality in Chongqing is nothing more than another trick in this game. Second, they often sow discord between two other countries, so that these two countries will fight each other. When these two countries are at war, Britain and America can grow stronger. The constant discord between Germany and France, and the failure of China and Japan to cooperate sincerely, are obvious examples. In particular, China and Japan even staged an internal conflict. Who was to blame for this? It is impossible to not feel endless indignation when we think of this.

China and Japan, whether from a historical, cultural, or geographical point of view, should cooperate with each other and work closely together. This is an immutable principle that no one can distort. As early as November 28th of the 13th year of the Republic of China, Sun Yat-sen delivered a speech on Pan-Asianism in Kobe, elaborating on the need for China and Japan to cooperate sincerely and jointly shoulder the responsibility of revitalizing Asia. If Pan-Asianism could have been realized earlier, then China and Japan would have cooperated closely without any disputes. Why couldn't Pan-Asianism be realized earlier? Here, the Chinese people's failure to fully understand the true meaning of Pan-Asianism certainly bears some responsibility, but the most important reason is still the British and American sowing of discord and provocation mentioned earlier. When the sparks of the Lugouqiao Incident uncontrollably spread, and the two great nations of China and Japan fought each other by mistake, it was the British and American imperialists who gloated on the sidelines and instigated the expansion and prolongation of the war. But must we be forever deceived and bound by Britain and America? No. In other words, we must have peace, we must build the nation in peace and anti-communism, and then we can break free from the shackles imposed on us by Britain and America, then we can consolidate the East Asian axis, and then we can revitalize East Asia. Moreover, the international situation in recent years has further proved that the policy of peace, anti-communism, and national construction that we have determined is absolutely correct. Chairman Wang Jingwei's declaration in the 27th year of the Republic of China is an indicator of our efforts for peace. Under the guidance of this indicator, there was the return of the National Government to Nanjing on March 30th of the 29th year of the Republic of China, and even more so the conclusion of the Sino-Japanese Treaty on the Adjustment of National Relations and the publication of the Sino-Japanese-Manchukuo Joint Declaration on November 30th of the same year. The Sino-Japanese Treaty on the Adjustment of National Relations begins by saying, "Hoping that the two countries will respect each other's inherent characteristics in the construction of East Asia, and under the common ideal of a new order based on morality, become good neighbors and work closely together to ensure permanent peace in East Asia, and hope to contribute to the peace of the entire world with this as the core." The Sino-Japanese-Manchukuo Joint Declaration also begins by saying, "Hoping that the three countries will respect each other's inherent characteristics, and under the common ideal of a new order based on morality in the construction of East Asia, become good neighbors and work closely together to form an axis of permanent peace in East Asia, and hope to contribute to the peace of the entire world with this as the core." How great is the significance of this treaty, how lofty is the ideal, this is self-evident. Since the conclusion of the treaty and the joint declaration, not only has the relationship between China, Japan, and Manchukuo become closer and closer, and the East Asian axis has become more consolidated, but also Germany, Italy, Romania, Spain, Hungary, Bulgaria, Slovakia, Croatia, Denmark, Thailand and other countries have successively recognized our national government, so that our national government has gained international recognition and sympathy, and its position has been strengthened. This is very gratifying.

When the East Asian axis is becoming increasingly consolidated, and the revitalization of East Asia is steadily progressing, it is also the time when the British and American aggressive forces in East Asia and the world are completely declining and collapsing. Originally, since the outbreak of the Second European War in September 1939, the German-Italian axis, with the force of a thunderbolt, leveled the British and American aggressive forces in Europe. In September 1940, the three countries of Japan, Germany, and Italy signed the Tripartite Pact, laying the foundation for the world axis. However, in the face of the rapid development of this world axis force, which is also the force of justice, the British and American imperialists not only dreamed of resisting the European axis, but also dreamed of hindering the East Asian axis. Our friendly nation, Japan, really could not bear it any longer, and thus the Greater East Asia War occurred. This Greater East Asia War is a just war against violence, and it has a theoretical basis for its inevitable victory. In addition, the strength of our friendly forces is majestic and capable, and they are invincible in battle and unconquerable in attack. It has been less than a year now, and they have completely eliminated the British and American aggressive forces in East Asia, and the liberation of East Asia has been completely realized. This is something that all East Asian nations are unanimously delighted about.

The Greater East Asia War broke out on December 8th of last year. On this day, our Chairman Wang Jingwei issued a statement, elaborating on the spirit of our country's determination to share weal and woe and cooperate with friendly nations. On December 18th of last year, Chairman Wang Jingwei broadcast to the entire nation, revealing three points to the nation, urging and encouraging the spirit of sharing weal and woe and cooperation with friendly nations. These three points are: first, to quickly establish public order; second, to strengthen military strength; and third, to increase production and conserve consumption. Since then, our entire nation has unanimously followed Chairman Wang Jingwei's instructions, and has done everything in its power to assist the Greater East Asia War. For example, the situation of public order has been rapidly improved, military strength has been rapidly strengthened, and increasing production and conserving consumption are also being actively implemented. On the other hand, our entire nation is also actively promoting the East Asia League Movement and the New National Movement. The former takes political independence, economic cooperation, military alliance, and cultural exchange as its guidelines, and the latter takes spiritual construction and material construction as its goals, in order to cooperate in the Greater East Asia War and the construction of the new East Asian order. Our country's assistance to the Greater East Asia War and the construction of Greater East Asia is our country's sincerity in fulfilling the treaty and our obligation of determination. And the friendly nations also have the same sincerity and determination in fulfilling the treaty. This point can be understood simply by looking at the friendly nations' cooperation and support for our country's economic, cultural, political, military and other aspects of construction during the Greater East Asia War. We are sincerely grateful for the cooperation and support of the friendly nations, and at the same time, we have increased our infinite confidence in the permanent peace of East Asia and the inevitable success of the axis. We must know that this Greater East Asia War is the turning point for the rise and fall of all the nations of East Asia. Chairman Wang Jingwei has long said, "In the last war, if we were unfortunately defeated by Britain and America, then the entire East Asian nation would be treated as slaves along with the Indian nation and the black race of Africa, the red race of America, and the brown race of Australia. The entire East Asia will permanently be a sub-colony of Britain and America, with no hope of turning over. On the contrary, if we defeat Britain and America, then the aggressive forces of the past century will be swept away, East Asia will be liberated, and China will gain freedom and equality." Chairman Wang Jingwei's instructions are so earnest and detailed. Our assistance to the war to liberate Greater East Asia in order to realize the coexistence and co-prosperity of the East Asian nations is truly the unanimous task of the East Asian nations and the only bright and open path for the East Asian nations. Finally, I would like to solemnly say again that I hope Chongqing will understand the current world situation. The British and American aggressive forces have already aroused the public anger of the just nations of the world, and they have unanimously risen up to resist. Therefore, the decline and collapse of Britain and America is an irreversible fate. The only plan for now is for Chongqing to repent and realize comprehensive peace. It must be understood that saving the country through peace is the only great way to revitalize China.

### Sugar and Oil Supply Worsening, Rationing Needed Urgently; The Scene of Queueing for Rice Reappears Today; Salt Rationing Expected to Begin Next Month

The supply of sugar, oil, and salt, three daily necessities in this city, has been the focus of attention of the city's residents in recent months, especially sugar and oil. The rationing agencies are constantly making excuses to avoid the cutoff of goods in retail shops and are shifting the responsibility, while the authorities have not yet indicated that they intend to find a thorough solution to these problems. Therefore, the situation is getting worse, and the scene of queueing for rice in the past has reappeared today. I don't know how this will end.

Sugar

Although the Sugar Industry Cooperative claims to have distributed 25,000 bags of sugar to various sugar retail shops from yesterday to be sold to citizens in accordance with the established interim measures, there was still no sufficient sugar retail on the market in various shops yesterday. It is said that all registered retail shops and large consumers can go to 23 Tongyun Street to apply for the allotted amount. The sugar supply in the French Concession is extremely poor. There is a sea of people buying sugar, especially foreigners, because their sugar consumption is higher than that of the Chinese. One yuan of sugar per day is like a drop in the bucket and does not solve the problem. Unless the authorities take the same rationing measures as for rice, this bad phenomenon cannot be eliminated.

Oil

The edible oil panic has not yet been fundamentally resolved. Although a certain amount is being rationed continuously, citizens often suffer from the difficulty of not being able to buy it due to fighting. Starting yesterday, 800 piculs of new goods were allocated to various shops for sale. 6,000 piculs stored in Pudong will also be requested to be approved by the military allocation association for shipment to Shanghai. According to the Edible Oil Traders Association, a total of 20,000 piculs of edible oil were recently ordered, of which about 6,000 piculs have already been distributed. The rest cannot be collected in whole batches, so the supply may be intermittent. As for whether it is possible to implement rationing, the relevant authorities are strictly silent.

Salt

Yumao Official Salt Company is establishing distribution centers in the center of various districts, such as Saposai Road in the French Concession, Xinzha Bridge, Kangnaot Road, Daxi Road, and Wuchang Road in the Public Concession, for the convenience of salt distribution to various sales shops starting next month. The registration of various businesses that recognize the sale of salt was completed yesterday afternoon. Once the review is completed, a salt purchase certificate (which states the date of issue, the shop number, and the affiliated Baojia, and specifies that each catty must not exceed 1.3 yuan) will be distributed to each qualified shop, which will then go to the distribution center in each district to collect and sell the goods in the amount. In order to prevent the sales shops from not complying with the statutory prices, or arbitrarily increasing or decreasing, and deducting the quantity, and to prohibit smuggled salt, many investigators will be dispatched at that time to conduct investigations. The allotted amount per person per month is one catty.

### Agricultural Advancement Association Awards Certificates for Exhibits

Chinese and Japanese people who went to visit were very enthusiastic. Yesterday (23rd) morning, visitors continued to arrive in an endless stream. At 2:00 PM, the award ceremony for the exhibits was held. A total of four to five hundred people from Chinese and Japanese organizations, guests, and participants in the exhibits attended. The ceremony did not end until around 4:00 PM, and the exhibition closed. The various situations are recorded below.

Opening Ceremony

Then, everyone performed a solemn bow of respect to the Shanghai Shrine Temple. Then, the head of the review committee (China Cotton Production Improvement Association), Mr. Kobayashi, reported on the results of the review of the exhibits. The awards were then presented in order. After the awards were presented, Honorary Chairman Mayor Chen Gongbo (represented by Mr. Ling Dating of the Municipal Government) was invited to deliver a speech, congratulating the agricultural professionals who exhibited for their efforts to improve the production of Greater East Asia within the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, and to enhance wartime materials for Greater East Asia. Then, guest Lieutenant Colonel Yokoyama and others gave congratulatory speeches successively. Zhu Baoyue, a third-year student at the National Shanghai University, gave a thank-you speech on behalf of all the award recipients. Finally, Director Tianbian delivered the closing speech. The ceremony ended at around 4:00 PM and the meeting adjourned.

Award Grades

The more than 2,000 exhibits at the venue were reviewed by Chinese and Japanese reviewers. As a result of the quality review, the performance of Song Yue, a third-year student in the undergraduate department of Shanghai University, was the best.

### Preparatory Committee of the Stock Exchange Established; Notifying Securities Firms to Register

After the Japanese army entered the concessions on December 8th of last year, various exchanges were closed to prevent the shaking of the Shanghai economy. Recently, the Shanghai economy has become stable, and the financial situation has shown a prosperous phenomenon, but there is an abundance of idle capital, and black market transactions are inevitable. The relevant authorities, in view of this, are thinking about proper methods. At the same time, Shanghai gentry merchants and financial leaders have repeatedly requested the Asia Development Board to allow the exchange to officially open and to find a way for idle capital to be properly handled. It has recently been heard that the matter has been decided and the authorities have agreed. The new exchange is named the Shanghai Stock Exchange.

It has been decided that it will be under military management and organized by the Shanghai Office of the Japanese Embassy. The Preparatory Committee of the Shanghai Stock Exchange has been organized and has notified various securities and stock firms to register in order to submit them to the Embassy Office for approval. It is also heard that after the establishment of the exchange, the authorities will strictly ban other illegal transactions.

### Minister Tajiri to Return Home to Attend East Asia Economic Conference

The English-language "The China Press" said that the Japanese-language "Continental Daily News" published this morning (23rd) that Minister Tajiri of the Shanghai Office of the Japanese Embassy is scheduled to leave Shanghai for Tokyo in a few days in order to submit to the Japanese government a plan that has a far-reaching impact on the wartime development of resources in Central China. It is expected that Tajiri will submit his plan to the Japanese government at the Tokyo Asia Economic Conference to be held in Tokyo from November 26th to 28th. Participants in the conference will include Japanese economic experts and officials from various parts of East Asia dispatched by the Greater East Asia Ministry.

The plan that Tajiri is carrying to Tokyo is based on the resolutions obtained at a series of meetings recently held at the Shanghai Embassy Office, and includes measures to expand and strengthen the structure of the Embassy Office in order to achieve the ultimate goal of aligning the economic development of Central China with the needs of the Greater East Asia War.

### How to Deal with Vagrant Children (Part 1) - Seeking Adoption, Introducing Production Occupations, Paving the Way for Rehabilitation for Juvenile Offenders - A New Posture for Child Protection

To solve social problems, one cannot rely solely on the efforts of a few people of conscience and virtue, but rather a large-scale, organized collective action is needed to reduce or eradicate the evils in society that can cause various problems. Shanghai is a city full of the sharpest contradictions, a thirty-third heaven and an eighteenth hell! Some are masters of contradiction, who can use it to seek more benefits; some are slaves of contradiction, who encounter unimaginable pain because of it. Among these numerous contradictions, unhealthy social phenomena such as unemployment, poverty, vagrancy, and crime have emerged. Even personal problems, when traced to their roots, cannot be separated from the influence of society, because the formation of social order is mostly due to factors such as customs, habits, laws, and systems that have been passed down from generation to generation, and not entirely created by the people currently living, such as family and marriage problems.

In Shanghai, there are many charitable organizations. The targets of their work are mainly to obtain considerable economic power from the manufacturers of contradictions to rescue the people sacrificed by the contradictions. In other words, it is asking the contradiction manufacturers to treat the contradictions. Regardless of whether this approach makes sense logically, the passive relief work of those charitable organizations over the years has been enough to leave a not bad impression in people's minds. In terms of organization, they almost all appear in a private capacity. Apart from the Public Works Department's Child Protection Section, it is simply impossible to find a second one that promotes passive social service work by municipal agencies.

Because the Child Protection Section, sponsored by the Public Works Department, is slightly more stable in terms of economy, it has not spent a lot of effort on publicity and fundraising plans since its establishment, unlike other charitable organizations. Therefore, it has been able to concentrate more energy on implementing more practical benefits and has laid a mainstay position in the field of social services. The so-called child protection is to select the parts related to children in social problems such as unemployment, crime, poverty, vagrant families, marriage, etc., and give them appropriate treatment under objective conditions. Four years ago, the Child Protection Section assumed the sacred responsibility of specializing in the relief work of poor working youth. Like the beggars wandering in the streets, the women and children who were unfortunately abducted, the maids who suffered all kinds of bullying, the prostitutes who sold their bodies, and the lost and wandering children, they cannot obtain social security and are always in danger of being swallowed by this dark reality. When they are arrested by the police or introduced to the Child Protection Section by other charitable organizations, the section arranges a place for them to settle down after careful investigation.

The first type of work is family search. The Child Protection Section has always sought out families for children who are lost or have other situations, so that they can be reunited with their families. This work took on a new posture and added a lot of importance in May of this year. Because at that time, the refugee camps in Shanghai were closed one after another, and it was difficult to arrange for a large number of vagrant children. Later, it was decided to temporarily place them in beggar shelters. Precisely because there were more monks than gruel, the Protection Section gradually realized that the work of finding families was becoming more and more important. In fact, many children are not homeless. Some run away privately because of poor family relations and do not want to call home, some are unable to support themselves due to the lack of family support, or for various reasons, are unwilling to support themselves and gradually become depraved, some are abandoned in shelters because their knowledge is clumsy and their parents do not like them, and become nominal refugee children or orphans, some... In this way, the Child Protection Section felt it was difficult! At first, the section hired a social worker to visit the children in various charitable organizations, gain their trust, and seek clues before going out to find their families in person. In August, ten more social workers were hired to participate in the work. Due to their practical work experience, the younger children are ignorant and answer irrelevantly. One lost child only knew that his father worked in a place where they "played ball". He spoke very vaguely, only using his hands to pretend to play ball, so that the visitor could understand his meaning. After many twists and turns, his family was found near the French Concession Jai Alai Stadium. His father was related to the Jai Alai Stadium. The older children lied all the time, causing the social workers to run around day and night, resulting in nothing. In the end, a total of 276 children were sent back because their families were found in the past five months, including 157 boys and 119 girls. The best performer was a social worker who found their families for more than 50 children in two months.

### Renovation of Cathay Mansions

### Memorial Service for Guo Jiuru

### Public Debt Still Facing Turbulence

The unofficial market for public debt changed again yesterday, first rising sharply and then falling drastically. Financial institutions continued to sell off, marking the third day of this trend. This seems to be related to the pressure on loan funds. The tightness of credit is becoming more pronounced today, which was unexpected by many. However, buyers were still active yesterday and did not show weakness. There is still much turbulence ahead, and it will not be easy to calm the stormy waves for a while. Yesterday, Class C bonds opened at 61 yuan, rising to 2 yuan and 3 jiao. After that, financial institutions gradually sold off, soon breaking through 2 yuan, then breaking through 1 yuan. As more sellers emerged, the 60 yuan level was also broken, then the 59 yuan level. At one point, it even fell to 58 yuan, seeing 57 yuan and 7 jiao, and finally settled at 8 yuan and 2 jiao. Class A bonds fell to 9 yuan, with small lots trading at 56 yuan and 5 jiao, and finally settled at 8 yuan. Class B bonds fell from 58 yuan to 4 yuan, a difference of 4 yuan and 3 jiao. Class D bonds fell from 56 yuan to the lowest price of 3 yuan. Class E bonds fell from 57 yuan to 3 yuan and 9 jiao, and finally settled at 4 yuan and 2 jiao. The trend is difficult to predict. Due to the sharp drop in market prices, many people were selling off. If there is a compensation, it may not be difficult to turn around and stop the decline. As a result, market prices all fell back by 1 to 3 yuan and 7 jiao. The number of transactions was quite high, but it is still impossible to verify.

### Modest Declines in Old Shares of Chinese Companies

Yesterday, the Chinese stock market remained sluggish. Newly listed stocks lacked investment, while older stocks experienced limited declines. Public utilities showed particular strength. Zhabei Water and Electricity saw a new high of 53.5 yuan in morning trading due to buying interest, but soon fell back to 51.2 yuan due to profit-taking, still a gain of 2.25 yuan. Huashang Electric also rose and then leveled off. Great China Match was also targeted by buyers, rising to 295 yuan for the final transaction price. Cultural industry stocks such as Commercial Press and other bookstores were stable. Although there were no buyers, holders were unwilling to sell easily. In the department store sector, China Products Company fell the most sharply, by 8 yuan. Wing On and Sincere each fell slightly by 2 yuan, and Underwear fell by 5 jiao. In the textile industry, only Wing On Textile fluctuated around 1,880 yuan, a small drop of 5 yuan. Great China Weaving, with small-denomination shares, had already fallen below the 10 yuan mark, with sellers offering at 9.25 yuan. Hongsheng also approached the 10 yuan mark. Great Light Weaving, Xinfeng, Xinfu Rain Printing and Dyeing, and Fuchang Dyeing and Weaving were relatively stable. New pharmaceutical stocks also experienced declines of 1 to 2 yuan. Sino-French broke through 100 yuan, New Asia retreated to near 50 yuan, and Minyi entered the 90 yuan mark. Wuzhou was the only one to rise, by 5 yuan. Nanyang Tobacco fell slightly by 3.5 yuan. Other stocks also experienced considerable declines. Trading was sparse. Kang Yuan Cannery saw increasing numbers of people seeking to sell after the capital increase, with each share being priced at 50 yuan. At one point, it had fallen to the break-even point. Tonghui Machinery was circulating in the market, priced between 12 and 13 yuan. Prices are listed below.

### Jewelry Prices Unchanged, Military Notes Decline

Yesterday, the selling price of jewelry gold in the Shanghai Yinlou industry was still not increased, at 2,750 yuan per tael (purchases less than 300 yuan), mainly because the industry still has no official market opening. It is reported that the price has risen to 2,660 and 80 yuan, with small transactions, an increase of about 70 yuan. The price of jewelry silver is still 14 yuan per tael. The price for internal business is stable at 13 yuan and 2 jiao to 4 yuan.

The interest rate of the Money Trade Association is still unchanged at 1 jiao and 4 fen.

The price of Japanese military notes has seen a decline, due to fewer settlements. The price for internal business is a few li, at 5 yuan, 5 jiao, 5 fen, 4, 6 li. The selling price at small money houses and banks is 5 yuan, 5 jiao, 6 fen, and the purchase price is 5 fen, which is level.

### Banks and Money Houses Submit Enemy Deposits

In order to comply with the Japanese authorities' announcement to investigate enemy property, banks and money houses in Shanghai are preparing a list of deposits of people from various countries, including columns for account name, type of deposit, depositor's nationality, address, occupation, deposit amount as of December 7, 1941, and current deposit amount. It is reported that the above form has been submitted to the temporary joint association of banks and money houses for collection and submission.

### Scattered Arrivals of Coarse Grains

Scattered arrivals of coarse grains were still seen yesterday, but the quantity was limited and the market remained firm.

### Commercial Briefs

New Steel Sheet Transactions Sparse
Transactions of new steel sheets, which have long been in short supply on the market, have remained sluggish since yesterday. Standard selling prices are weak. Yesterday, the market price for 2.5 to 7.5 li patterned sheets was 20,000 yuan per ton, and the price for 1 to thick patterned sheets was 18,000 yuan per ton. Old oil tank steel sheets were priced at around 12,000 yuan per ton.

Tinplate Extremely Scarce
Tinplate, whether 24 or 26 gauge large tinplate, 180 or 200 pound double-linked iron, or 10 or 100 pound single-linked small tinplate, has been completely exhausted on the market. Traders report that all varieties are out of stock, so there is no accurate reporting on market conditions.

Dried Longan Prices Far Apart
Merchants who hoarded dried longan before Customs are now seeing their hopes of making a profit dashed due to the poor market conditions, and some intend to sell off their goods with the market. Yesterday, there was a batch of samples, all very red and shiny, with good pieces. However, the goods were not timely, and buyers offered extremely harsh prices, with a large difference, so no transaction was made.

Mustard Greens Slightly Loose
Recently, due to quieter actual sales, the market has turned flat. However, it is still difficult to be cheap due to the land price cut, and it is not easy to be too small. Yesterday, the market price for top-grade mustard greens was 720 yuan, and for second-grade greens, the price varied from 570 to 80 yuan.

Cigarette Market Firm
Shipments are still active, and local sales and hoarding have not stopped, so prices have remained high. The opening price for British Brands is still 8,950 yuan, Old Dao 7,850 yuan, Pin Hai 7,850 yuan, Fairy 6,950 yuan, Golden Building 3,500 yuan, Red Rose sales are very active, with a selling price of 2,850 yuan, up 100 yuan.

### Speculation on the Ghost World

â Indolence

Although this is the time to hold crabs and appreciate chrysanthemums, the autumn wind is blowing harder and harder, adding another threat to wandering beggars. One day, walking through a busy street, I saw the body of a beggar lying on the side of the road. According to the murmurs of passersby, the beggar had frozen to death last night due to his thin clothing and weak body.

At that moment, an association came to my mind, reminding me of a "Rare Overseas Tale" I had seen in a newspaper a few days ago. The "Rare Tale" was also a kind of oddity, saying that there was a special beauty parlor in the United States that specialized in making up the dead, with various levels and prices for hair dressing and face repair. The advertisement was very novel, saying that the most expensive first-class service could "immediately ascend to heaven and gain happiness"âat the time, I thought this beautician had some of the humor of Mark Twain and Bernard Shaw. However, seeing this dead beggar, I couldn't help but sigh for him. If that beautician really held the key to "heaven," then this dead beggar would not be qualified to ascend to "heaven"!

There are many myths and legends about the ghost world. Although we don't know what happens after people die, according to the interesting ghost pictures of the national essence and the advertisement of this foreign beautician, the views of Chinese and Westerners on the underworld are not very different. That is, if there really is another ghost world, that ghost world is no different from the human world: there are levels, there are rich and poor, some live in heaven, and some still live in hell.

Like the dead beggar on the road heading to the ghost world with disheveled hair and dirty face, I'm afraid he will still live the same kind of life as in the human world. Because in the ghost world, power is also important, and money is also importantâthis kind of speculation is different from the speculation of some religious scholars and theologians about the ghost world. They have used the "other world" to comfort the poor, frustrated, and obedient, thinking that living a hard life means they can ascend to heaven faster after death and become gods or something, thus making people even more disheartened. Some people, like Thoreau, glorify death. But if the ghost world really depends on a person's status in the human world and everything is the same as in the human world, then you are being fooled. It is useless to complain in the ghost world, because the ghost world, like the human world, requires a litigation fee.

No one can be sure whether the ghost world exists or not. No one has ever circled the ghost world and reported any news. However, because people are afraid of not feeling at ease after death, there are two different speculations about the ghost world, which may or may not exist. In my opinion, I believe in the speculation that the ghost world is the same as the human world: first, obtain all human rights in the human world, and at the very least, fight back for what you deserve to be full and warm, which has been taken away by others, so that you can also obtain happiness in the ghost world. I thought of the dead beggar on the road. If he had this kind of speculation about the ghost world, he would definitely cheer up in the human world. But now, he is dead, and it just so happens that there is a ghost world, and it just so happens that there is a ghost world like the human world waiting for him, and he is still a beggar. Thinking about this idea is really terrible!

### A Call for Libraries to Open on Sundays

â Seeking Wind

Libraries are institutions where culture gathers, and they are the general repositories of human civilization. They collect and treasure the world's essence, and they also represent the cultural level of a country, a nation, or a city. The task of libraries lies in promoting the great work of popularizing culture and knowledge, which has great significance. Of course, they belong to the public, not just a special class. Because they try to provide general studious and promising people with intellectual resources for in-depth research, and they are not closed-door, selfish profit-making institutions. Therefore, the number of libraries in various countries around the world, and their openness to the public, can also represent the progress of civilization. That Shanghai can have six vast libraries is truly the happiness of Shanghai residents. I hope that every resident can make full use of them, and at the same time, I hope that the library authorities can accept the residents' requests.

Everyone knows that Sunday is a public holiday, especially for those who work in companies and factories. Every Sunday is regarded as a happy day. Because on that day, they no longer have to go to the company or factory, and they can freely control the time of this day. Libraries serve the public, and of course, serving is their duty. Like civilized countries around the world, when various institutions and factories are closed, libraries are open alone to meet the public's needs, so that the public can visit them. The intention is very perfect. But what about the six major libraries in Shanghai? Each of them is closed on Sundays, so that people who work in companies and factories cannot use their spare time to seek knowledge, but instead are disappointed. The insistence of the library authorities on the right to rest on Sundays has been clearly expressed among friends (some friends have jointly requested the New Asia Library authorities for these matters, but the result has been without response).

Then let me suggest a compromise: (1) The six major libraries in Shanghai should open for borrowing, (2) open all day on Sundays, and (3) rest on Mondays to make up for the right to rest on Sundays.

### Deception

â Jie Ting

That's right, I'm learning "deception," but I'm not a deceiver.

The stones on the mountain are multi-faceted. A gust of wind blew them off the mountain, and they fell clumsily into the stream at the foot of the mountain. The stream flowed slowly, flowing over those hard, multi-faceted stones. The stones were scoured, day and night. The hard stones were still hard, but their multi-faceted shapes could not be found. The stones in front of you are smooth.

Human beings love these smooth little stones.

When young people first enter society, they work enthusiastically according to their ideals, but the results often disappoint and depress you... The reason is very simple: the enthusiasm is not permeated with the element of "deception."

"Deception" is a good virtue that can relieve you of all pain.

"Deception" is a method. But the essence of "deception" is not purely bad, nor is it purely good; it all depends on whether the method is used properly.

Really, I am learning "deception," observing "deception," and practicing "deception"; but I don't want to be a deceiver.

### Cherishing Winter Clothes

â Wu Xiqi

Dear Mr. Editor: I am a primary school student. I often hear about various tragic events in the outside world at home, so I often donate money to help the world. This time, the Young Women's Christian Association wants to make winter clothes because of the cold weather and distribute them to civilians, beggars, etc. I think this is a charitable nature, and the intention is good. However, I often see beggars in the streets not only not cherishing the cotton clothes from last year, but also damaging them, thinking that the severe winter is over and there is no need to worry. But they don't know that after a mild winter, there will be another winter. I think there will still be many such discoveries this year. I hope the Young Women's Christian Association will persuade them to cherish them. Therefore, I would like to ask you to tell them (the staff of the Young Women's Christian Association) to persuade those who are poor and do not cherish materials whenever they encounter them. I wish you good health. Sincerely, a primary school student, Wu Xiqi

### Sharing the Same Boat in the Storm

â He Jia Zhi

â â Vengeance

Huanglong also came over and couldn't help but interject, saying, "So, Cheng Bing was burned to death. Damn it, how could he be burned to death?" Weicheng was afraid that Huanglong would say too much and cause trouble, so he quickly said with a smile, "Brother Huanglong, today is the first day of the new year, how can you curse people as soon as you open your mouth? Have you forgotten the taboo?" Weicheng unintentionally called out Huanglong's name. The teahouse owner poked his head out and looked at Huanglong, and said with a smile, "Ah! You, old brother, are you Huanglong, who runs a teahouse in Guanyintang? As soon as you walked in, I felt that you looked familiar. Because I've met you once, but I didn't see you clearly in the light at night. Haha, we're in the same business. I just started a few days ago. You're a veteran." Huanglong replied coldly, "Oh, you recognize me, but I couldn't recognize you. I'm sorry. What's your name? You don't have to tell me, because even if you tell me, I'll still forget and have to ask again next time we meet. We have something to say, you can wait a while to talk."

Weicheng was deeply afraid that Huanglong would offend someone even more, so he quickly took out money to pay the bill, even paying for the tea of the old man and his son surnamed Ma. The old man thanked him repeatedly. Weicheng secretly said to the old man, "You're going back to Antun Town, right? Let's talk one step at a time." The old man said, "I came to visit relatives, and I was going to go back." At that time, Weicheng, Huanglong, the old man and his son walked out of the small teahouse and saw the golden sunset hanging obliquely on the mountain peak. Everyone walked along the avenue. Weicheng asked, "I myself find it funny that I didn't even know about such a big thing in this relative's family. It's no wonder, it's the family of my great-grandfather's cousin. I ask you again, does this Cheng Bing Cheng Chunhui have no one left in Antun Town, no fields or houses?" The old man said, "No, no, they've been gone for a long time. What do you want them for?" Weicheng said, "It's really like lice, it's because we found a promissory note, Cheng Bing's mother borrowed money from us, but that's okay. Their family has been destroyed, how can we ask them for money? But after their fire, didn't any of their family members disappear?" The old man said, "No, no, I know this matter clearly. At that time, my brother was the local security officer, and the two bodies that crawled out of the ashes were buried by my brother. That burned site is now a green grass garden." (237)
