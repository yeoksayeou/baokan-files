### Gandhi and Nehru Declare: Determined to Fight to the End

Muslim League Criticizes the Congress Party

Lisbon, Third Allied News Agency Report: According to news from New Delhi, Gandhi and Nehru were very displeased upon hearing the threatening remarks made by Amery, the British Secretary of State for India, and Cripps, the Minister in charge of Indian affairs, regarding the Indian issue. Gandhi recently published an article in Harijan, replying by saying that the All-India National Congress Party will disregard both open and hidden threats, and will not change the policy it has decided upon as a result. The civil disobedience movement will be launched as scheduled. The only way to salvage the situation is to grant India immediate independence. During the war, Allied troops can be stationed in India, but they have no right to interfere in India's internal affairs. India should be as free as Britain. Nehru made a speech in Allahabad, using even more intense language. He said, "Struggle, struggle to the end, this is my reply to Amery and Cripps. India's self-respect leaves no room for bargaining. I deeply know that Britain is currently in a difficult situation. Over the years, I have requested a reasonable solution so that all countries can follow suit and move forward as free nations. Thinking about it now, I am filled with sorrow and indignation."

Allahabad, Second Havas News Agency Report: The leader of the Indian National Congress Party, Nehru, recently made a speech here, stating that we will fight to the end, this is my reply to Amery and Cripps. The aspirations of the Indian people leave no room for bargaining. Recalling my personal constant struggle over the past year, I originally wanted to establish an agreement with Britain so that India could become a free country, following Britain's lead and moving forward together. But now, what is the result? Thinking about this, I am filled with sorrow and indignation. Furthermore, former Congress Party Chairman Prasad also made a speech in Patna, stating that Gandhi's proposed civil disobedience movement based on non-violent principles is the final and decisive struggle for India's freedom. Britain still refuses our independence, claiming that India is not yet unified, making it difficult to transfer power to the Indians. Gandhi has a different view on this, as he believes that India must be independent before it can be unified. This is the result of our leader's many years of experience, and it is also the conclusion of the recent talks with Cripps.

Bangkok, Third Haitong News Agency Report: The President of the All-India Muslim League, Jinnah, made a speech in Bombay on Friday, severely criticizing the policies of the All-India National Congress Party, but at the same time, he strongly stated that there is indeed a possibility of cooperation between these two major Indian parties. Not only that, but the Muslim League is willing to establish an agreement with the Congress Party under certain conditions. Those concerned are very interested in Jinnah's speech, believing that the Muslim League fears that the Congress Party will greatly expand its power due to the implementation of the disobedience movement, which will ultimately be detrimental to the Muslim League. Therefore, Jinnah made this speech. Another explanation is that Britain is using its financial power to force the Muslim League to confront the Congress Party, in order to destroy or at least delay the Congress Party's plan by using Indians to control Indians.

Mahatma Gandhi Arrives in Bombay Yesterday

Bombay, Third Havas News Agency Report: Mahatma Gandhi arrived here today, and the crowd welcoming him at the station was huge and bustling. Gandhi is scheduled to attend the All-India Congress Party Executive Committee meeting on the 6th of this month. The main topic of discussion at the meeting will be the "British Quit India" resolution passed by the Standing Committee. Today is Gandhi's "Day of Silence," so there was no action of any kind.

Bangkok, Second Allied News Agency Report: According to news from London, Amery, the Secretary of State for India, recently instructed the Governor-General of India, Linlithgow, to closely monitor Gandhi and Nehru, and decided to take full precautions at the National Congress Party Congress in Bombay on the 7th. If Gandhi and Nehru's words and actions are unstable, the meeting should be stopped immediately. The same instructions have also been issued regarding measures to deal with Muslims.

Bangkok, Third Haitong News Agency Report: It has been learned here that there are widespread rumors in various parts of India that riots and armed conflicts may occur when the National Congress Party Committee discusses Gandhi's independence movement resolution on August 7th. Many people in India believe that if Gandhi launches a civil disobedience movement, most of the shops in India may close down. In recent days, shops have been selling large quantities of food and other items to prevent such an eventuality. It has also been heard that many Congress Party leaders have left their hometowns and gone to Bombay to prepare to attend the Congress Party Committee meeting. Speaker Acharya has now left Calcutta, and Nehru will also leave Allahabad tomorrow.

Pro-British Faction Proposes a Solution

Bangkok, Second Allied News Agency Report: Sir Sapru, President of the Liberal Federation of India, who has always been pro-British, has proposed the following plan to resolve the Indian issue:

    Britain should clearly state that it will grant the Indian people independence and freedom one year after the end of the war.
    Britain should clarify the powers of the Governor-General and the Indians in administration.
    Foreign affairs and finance should be managed by the Indians themselves.
    The advisors in the state governments should be abolished.
    The civil disobedience movement should be suspended.
    Gandhi and leaders of various factions in India should convene an Indian Congress.

The above proposals are nothing more than speaking for Britain. Congress Party leader Nehru strongly rejected the proposal, saying that the Congress Party would never accept this proposal, because what we are asking for is only the immediate realization of independence and freedom for India. Furthermore, Sapru's faction has very few members and no value in existing, so it will not affect the direction of the Congress Party.

Non-Cooperation Movement Brewing

Lisbon, Second Allied News Agency Report: According to a dispatch from Wardha, the heads of the Indian National Congress Party met with Gandhi here on the 2nd to listen to the implementation plan of the new non-cooperation movement, and to discuss the specific direction of the non-cooperation movement, so that when Britain rejects the demands of the Congress Party, the whole country will launch the non-cooperation movement at the same time. The British authorities are deeply worried about this, and are using their usual tactics of both hard and soft measures to prevent the launch of the non-cooperation movement. For example, the Bengal branch of the Indian Landowner's League passed a resolution on the 2nd, stating that the non-cooperation movement would give the enemy an opportunity to suppress the Indian people and plunge India into misery. It is believed that this was instigated by Britain. According to a dispatch from New Delhi, the Indian government has received instructions from Amery, the Secretary of State for India, to take full preparations to deal with the launch of the non-cooperation movement, but the situation has been decided and Britain has no way to reverse it.

Lisbon, Second Allied News Agency Report: According to a Reuters dispatch from Patna, India, Dr. Prasad, the former chairman of the Indian National Congress, spoke on the urgent Indian issue on the 2nd, stating that the new All-India National Movement advocated by Gandhi - that is, the form of a non-violent movement - is actually the final battle for India to gain independence. In the past, the British government often used the excuse that India was not yet unified to refuse to return power to the Indians. Therefore, Gandhi's movement this time will achieve unification and realize independence. This is the result of Gandhi's experience over the years, and also the lesson learned from Cripps' visit to India recently.

Istanbul, Third Haitong News Agency Report: Former Turkish Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Aktay, lost consciousness in his residence yesterday. A pistol was left beside him. He was rushed to the hospital after being discovered, but died in the afternoon. He apparently shot himself due to a nervous breakdown. According to reports, the deceased was appointed as the Ambassador to the Soviet Union in 1939 and was recalled to his country this year to report on the attempted assassination of the German Ambassador to Turkey, von Papen. He did not return to his post after the incident, and in the previous month, the government appointed Akat as the successor Ambassador to the Soviet Union.

Istanbul, Third Havas News Agency Report: Turkish Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Aktay, who was recently summoned back to his country, committed suicide by poison today at his residence on Bolingjibo Island near here.

As far as is generally known, the ambassador was physically weak. He suffered greatly from the severe wartime life spent in Kubyshev last winter, which made his physical strength even worse, which may be one of the reasons for his sudden suicidal thoughts.

### Vichy Authorities Promote Rice Planting

Vichy, Second Havas News Agency Report: France's rice has always been imported from French Vietnam. This source has been blockaded and cut off. The French authorities are now planning to promote rice planting to remedy the situation. The French people's food consumption requires a total of 600,000 tons of rice per year. Since the armistice agreement was signed between France and Germany in June 1940, the British blockade policy has been extended to France. At that time, France only had 58,000 tons of rice in stock. The authorities then implemented restrictions on consumption, stipulating that each person could only purchase 10 ounces per month. On the one hand, they promoted rice planting, with the Rhone River Delta being the most suitable area. Many Annamese people have been hired to teach rice planting methods. Italy has the highest rice production in Europe, but its output is only one-tenth of that of Vietnam. Although France's rice planting plan does not hope to be self-sufficient or catch up with Italy, it is hoped that it can meet the urgent need.

Discovery of the New World 450th Anniversary; Spain Celebrates

Huelva, Spain, Third Haitong News Agency Report: Today is the 450th anniversary of Columbus' departure from the port of Palos and the discovery of the Americas. A large-scale celebration ceremony will be held locally. There will be a commemorative drama performance at the La Rabida Monastery. The training ships Hortska and Taurul have arrived locally to represent the Spanish Navy and participate in the celebration ceremony.

Madrid, Second Havas News Agency Report: Tomorrow is the 450th anniversary of Columbus' departure from Spain and the discovery of the New World. In view of the current situation, the authorities do not intend to hold a grand celebration ceremony.

At that time, many Spanish warships will sail to participate, and members of the youth front will light torches on various mountain peaks. A mass will be held at the famous Santa Maria Monastery to mark the anniversary, as Columbus and his companions prayed in the monastery before setting off. In addition, newspapers everywhere are publishing Columbus's sailing deeds with high praise.

### Allied Countries Discuss Defending Iran

### Istanbul Newspaper Criticizes British Measures in Iran

Istanbul, Second Havas News Agency Report: After the cabinet crisis in Iran, most newspapers here severely criticized the various measures adopted by the British authorities. Prominent journalist Nayat published an article in the "Kanghal Leaf" newspaper stating that "The current crisis cannot be dismissed as merely a domestic affair. Independent nations of the British Commonwealth, proud of their freedom and independence, must not only occupy other countries, but should also reflect on themselves in all aspects. The various measures adopted by Britain in Iran have exceeded the scope of military needs. This is a shameful disgrace in British history. Iran has fallen into a perpetual crisis. The resignation of the cabinet is just a sign of the overall chaos. To save the overall situation, the only way is to reduce the area of foreign military occupation and let the Iranian people handle Iranian internal affairs."

### New Zealand Earthquake

Wellington, Second Havas News Agency Report: An earthquake occurred in northern New Zealand, about 50 miles from here, causing considerable damage to the walls and windows of civilian houses in the city, with losses of several hundred thousand pounds.

### British Magazine Advocates Closed Parliament Sessions

London, First Havas News Agency Report: "The World Review" magazine recently published an article by editor Carmichael discussing the issue of holding closed parliament sessions, stating that "The reason why the British Parliament must hold closed sessions is not entirely because it does not want to provide the enemy with information, but actually because of the emotional impulses of the Allied countries themselves. Washington does not seem to realize that discussions of thorny issues should actually be relegated to closed sessions." "The Economist" magazine also wrote an article in support, stating that the war information coming from the UK and the US sometimes differs greatly. If the two Allied governments can maintain closer contact, parliamentary debates will be more convenient.

### Battles on the Sal River and Don River Areas: German and Soviet Forces Engage in Bloody Combat; Red Army Resistance Strengthened, Situation Returns to a Stalemate

German Supreme Headquarters, 3rd (Havas Agency Telegram) – Today's German military communiqué stated that our tank divisions pursued enemy forces to the upper reaches of the Kupen River, where the resisting Soviet forces were routed, capturing countless military supplies and numerous artillery pieces. In the Jie-jia area, enemy rear-guard units were forced to retreat southward, with German forces continuing to advance. Between the Salko and Don Rivers, German and Romanian forces persistently forced the enemy to retreat eastward. German aircraft provided significant support to ground operations, striking Soviet transportation lines in the Kupen area with particular intensity. The railway connecting Baku and Rostov was heavily bombed. Soviet counterattacks along the Don River were repelled, with 85 enemy tanks destroyed. Our dive bombers and anti-tank gun teams played a crucial role. Our aircraft conducted night raids on ships on the Volga River, sinking two oil tankers and six freighters, while damaging nine other freighters. North of Rzhev, before Leningrad, intense enemy units continued to attack our forces on the Vulgok-Wei front, hoping to alleviate the pressure felt by Soviet forces on the southern route. In the Lapland region, German infantry and mountain troops repeatedly attacked several Soviet positions with swift movements. Yesterday, Soviet forces lost 114 aircraft, while five German aircraft went missing.

Bear City, 3rd (Allied News Agency Telegram) – German mechanized units continue to advance towards the Caucasus. The Red Army is now making strenuous efforts to prevent German forces from advancing east towards Stalingrad, an industrial city on the Volga River. To maintain its security, the Red Army is striving to prevent the German forces east of Salsk from quickly linking up with the German forces crossing the Don River. Bloody battles are now unfolding in the Sal River and Don River areas. German paratroopers are landing behind Soviet lines, disrupting the Red Army's front.

Moscow, 3rd (Havas Agency Telegram) – The Soviet Information Bureau announced this morning that Red Army forces engaged in fierce fighting with the enemy last night in the Kreskaya, Tsimlyanskaya, Kushchufskaya, and Salsk areas. German forces launched a major offensive in Kreskaya, sacrificing 2,000 soldiers. In the Kushchufskaya and Salsk areas, the Red Army conducted a difficult defensive battle. Cossack cavalry launched several attacks, routing 1,500 German soldiers in the Kupen and Don River areas.

Stockholm, 3rd (Havas Agency Telegram) – Over the past 24 hours, there has been little major change in the southern Soviet war situation. German motorized vanguard units are still advancing towards the Kupen River, appearing to have reached the vicinity of Kropotkin. German tanks in that area have a significant advantage. Although the Cossack forces are equipped with anti-tank guns, they lack sufficient mechanized units to support them, so they may still have to retreat. However, it can be predicted that German elite units will inevitably encounter a strong Soviet defense line one day, which they will be unable to break through, thus requiring encirclement tactics. At the current rate of German progress, German forces should reach the Kupen River within this week. This river is the only natural defense line east of the Kuma River and in northern Caucasus. It is expected that the main forces of both sides will come into contact within days. The outcome of this battle is of great importance to the success or failure of the German summer offensive. As for the Don River bend front, which is about 120 miles long, the resistance of the Soviet troops has been continuously strengthened, and the two armies have once again fallen into a stalemate. Regarding the battles around Voronezh, the Soviet military's center of resistance has now shifted to the mountainous area northwest of Kalach. In the past ten days, the Soviet side has lost 482 tanks, demonstrating that the Soviet military authorities have now decided to spare no sacrifice to defend key positions. However, the German summer offensive has already paid a great price and will inevitably persist to the end. Its destinations are initially Krasnodar and Meilutuo, then Stalingrad, and finally Astrakhan and Baku.

Berlin, 3rd (Havas Agency Telegram) – German forces have reached the upper reaches of the Kupen River. This river is a major waterway between the Don River and the Caucasus Mountains, originating from Mount Elbrus (the highest peak in the Caucasus Mountains). It initially flows north, then turns west, passing through the Kupen plain. Its tributaries flow into the Azov Sea and the Black Sea. The Kupen River is 880 kilometers long. The primary city in the Kupen region is Krasnodar, with a population of 200,000. Before the outbreak of this war, the total population of the Kupen region was 3.1 million.

Fierce Battles in the Don River Basin, Strong Soviet Resistance

Berlin, 3rd (Havas Agency Telegram) – According to a German High Command announcement, the battle situation in the Don River basin is intense, with strong Soviet resistance. German forces are increasing their troop strength and expect significant results. German and allied forces are pursuing Soviet forces, making considerable progress south of Kozovskaya and other areas. The Soviet rearguard units have been routed, and German forces have captured approximately 800 prisoners. Romanian forces are assisting in the southern advance and have achieved notable combat results. German aircraft are bombing retreating Soviet motorized units and attacking railways in the Kuban area. Several enemy aircraft were destroyed in their hangars. German and Italian joint forces are attacking Soviet bridgeheads in the Don River bend, forcing Soviet troops to retreat across the Don River. German forces repelled Soviet forces southwest of Kalach, destroying numerous tanks. Soviet bridgeheads were also bombed. Soviet attempts to cross the river in the northern Don area were repelled by Hungarian forces, suffering heavy losses. Soviet forces launched two offensives northwest of Voronezh, losing three tanks. German aircraft shot down 29 Soviet aircraft in the southern part of the Eastern Front yesterday.

Lisbon, 2nd (Central News Agency Telegram) – According to news from the Southern Front, the fiercest fighting on the Southern Front is in the areas of Bataysk and Kstovskoye, as well as the Caucasus line north of Loretsk and Salsk. The Soviet side also admits that the war situation is serious and states that the German army's fierce attack on the rear of the North Caucasus Soviet defense line has caused the situation to take a sharp turn for the worse. Another report says that the German troops who occupied Kstovskoye are pursuing the defeated Soviet troops to the south and continuing their attack. It is reported that the vanguard mechanized units of the German army on the Rostov-Baku railway have occupied many important places and are launching fierce attacks towards the Qi-Pao area. According to the report, this place is the intersection of the Rostov-Baku railway and the Stalingrad-Krasnodar railway, and the German army advancing along the Stalingrad-Krasnodar railway is echoing its friendly forces and pressing southwest. According to Vichy news, it is reported that the German vanguard has reached the Peyserkonevskaya area near Dazhou. The 70 kilometers of the railway leading to Peyserkonevskaya has been completely cut off by the German army.

Somewhere on the Ukrainian Border, 2nd (Havas Agency Telegram) – According to the latest news from the front, German forces in the Kuban area south of Rostov are still continuing their advance. The Teharesk railway center was occupied by German forces under General Book on the night of the 1st of this month. According to unconfirmed reports, the vanguard of German mechanized units reached the banks of the Kuban River yesterday, 30 miles west of the Teharesk-Armavir railway line. The railway hub city of Kropotkin is also under threat from German forces. It is generally believed that the current goal of General Book's German forces is the city of Krasnodar. As for the German offensive along the coast of Azov, it has slowed down because the Soviet garrison on the Taman Peninsula is putting up strong resistance.

Soviet Newspaper Calls on Military and Civilians to Defend the Nation with All Their Might

Moscow, 3rd (Allied News Agency Telegram) – Moscow Radio has just broadcast an editorial from the newspaper Pravda, calling on Soviet soldiers and civilians to defend the nation. According to Pravda, "The situation in the south is serious and complex. The danger to the country is now intense. In order to defeat the enemy's plans and protect the resources of the south, we must break the enemy's pressure. We must fight to the last drop of blood everywhere. We must prevent the enemy from entering every mountain, river, and piece of land. Every inch of land handed over to the Red Army is sacred. We would rather die than retreat."

Moscow, 2nd (Havas Agency Telegram) – Pravda recently published an article emphasizing the seriousness of the Red Army's situation, urging railway workers to focus on transportation. It stated, "Transportation is the lifeline of national defense, and the fate of the country depends on it. Your position is no different from that of soldiers on the front lines. From the railway director to the flag wavers and track workers, all have a major mission to fulfill. They must demonstrate their spirit of organization, discipline, and perseverance. Winter is not far away, and all preparations for water pool facilities and fuel supply should be made early."

### Eastern Front: German Troops

Occupy 80% of the Total

Stockholm, 2nd (Havas Agency Telegram) – "The Stockholm Daily News" recently carried a London telegram stating that, according to reliable British sources, since the outbreak of the German-Soviet war, the Soviet Union has suffered more than five million soldiers killed, wounded, and captured. The lost territory is approximately equal to the combined area of Italy, France, and Germany. The population in the occupied areas is also close to 50 million. Therefore, the population currently under Soviet rule has decreased to 140 million, while the population under German rule has reached 300 million. From an economic point of view, the Soviet Union has lost half of its steel production, now only able to produce 10 million tons of steel annually, while Germany can produce 40 million tons annually. Aluminum production has also been lost by 75%. The losses of coal mines and farmland are also considerable. Last year, the German forces concentrated in the Soviet Union accounted for about one-third of its total troop strength. This year, the German troops fighting on the Eastern Front account for about 80% of its total. Based on this analysis, opening a second front is a matter of utmost urgency. When the Soviet delegation visited London last month, they strongly advocated for the necessity of this action. It is rumored that General Marshall will be appointed as the commander-in-chief of the British and American forces on the second front. In reality, even if Marshall's appointment is announced immediately, it does not mean that the second front can be established within the year. British and American military experts generally believe that regarding the opening of the second front, only preparations can be made this year, and there will be no actual military action in Western Europe until 1943.

### Large Numbers of German Submarines

Head to the Mediterranean

Stockholm, 3rd (Havas Agency Telegram) – German Admiral Doenitz told a reporter from the Swedish Daily News yesterday that a large number of German submarines have gone to the Mediterranean to maintain the freedom of communication between Italy and North Africa. This move is not to evade the enemy, but to control the enemy's throat. In order to quickly and severely strike the enemy, we have conducted submarine warfare off the American coast. This matter is by no means easy, but the United States has devised a method to deploy a swift and non-negligible defense line. I do not wish to ignore the enemy's strength. As for the rumors that German submarines are using neutral territorial waters or floating islands as bases, they are ridiculous. In reality, our submarines are capable of crossing the Atlantic and approaching enemy coasts. All members of our submarine crews are naval volunteers. As for enemy bombing of our submarines, it has had no effect so far. At present, our submarines have very strong anti-aircraft equipment, and no bombing can damage them.

### Intense Artillery Battles on the Egyptian Front

Rome, 3rd (Allied News Agency Telegram) – According to an announcement by the Italian Supreme Command, air and artillery battles on the Egyptian front are very intense. Italian and German air forces are heavily bombing British tanks concentrated in the rear. During the attack on the Halfa airfield, two British fighter planes were shot down, and two other British planes were shot down by anti-aircraft fire.

Cairo, 3rd (Havas Agency Telegram) – The British Middle East Command announced this morning that British reconnaissance patrols were active on all routes of the Egyptian front last night. Yesterday, British field artillery attacked enemy positions on the southern route. British bombers and fighter planes attacked enemy reconnaissance teams in the Guataira Lowlands, achieving success. The enemy commander on the southern route also launched an attack.

### Air Defense Exercises Held on the Western Coast of Norway; Germany Broadly Constructs Airfields in Occupied Areas; Britain and the United States Consider Establishing a Supreme Command

Stockholm, 2nd (Havas Agency Telegram) – In recent days, "large-scale defense exercises have been held on the western coast of Norway, especially in the area southeast of Trondheim Harbor and Klixingsand, with the theme of preventing enemy landings. During the exercises, all merchant ships and fishing boats were prohibited from sailing in the exercise area, as the German authorities had reportedly placed mines in several places. In addition, the Norwegian authorities have ordered all public institutions to handle the matter in the same way as civilians, quickly handing over all copper, tin, and lead items, such as door knockers and metal equipment used in offices, to the authorities. Most of these collected items will be transported to German munitions factories, and the rest will be retained by domestic factories for their own use.

Madrid, 3rd (Havas Agency Telegram) – According to reports in newspapers here, if Britain and the United States want to attack Europe and open a second front, there is no hope of victory from the beginning. Foreign journalists who inspected the fortresses along the Atlantic coast all believed that they were extremely strong and difficult to attack. A Dutch journalist said that he believed that the Siegfried Line had been moved to the Atlantic coast. Another journalist said that the Atlantic coast has become a fortified line of steel and concrete. German troops are waiting in full battle readiness, and the transportation network is dense and can transport troops to threatened locations at any time. German tank divisions are also stationed in strategically important locations, preparing to move to the landing points of enemy forces. Airfields have been built throughout the occupied areas, and planes and warships patrol near the coast day and night.

New York, 3rd (Havas Agency Telegram) – The New York Times said in an editorial today that the authorities in charge in London and Washington are seriously considering the establishment of a joint British-American supreme commander to command all the forces of the two countries. It is being discussed whether to organize a supreme command composed of the naval, land, and air force generals of the two countries, or to hold meetings in London to decide on general strategies. However, this move has not yet been agreed upon, and some senior officers in Britain and the United States have expressed objections. Therefore, no decision will be made on this matter for at least several weeks. However, the situation will be different if the Allied forces suffer another setback in the Middle East or if the Soviet army's resistance collapses. Washington has now publicly admitted that the British-American staff group has failed to fully utilize the strengths of both countries, especially in terms of adjusting and distributing military equipment production and utilizing certain special weapons in the United States. British and American military authorities now unanimously believe that establishing a supreme command and appointing a commander-in-chief for Europe are both wise steps. Candidates for the generals to organize this supreme command have now been proposed, indicating that this matter is already imminent.

Lisbon, 3rd (Havas Agency Telegram) – New York Telegram, the Baltimore Sun yesterday presented several people as candidates for the Allied forces' supreme commander, in addition to General Marshall, the newspaper also proposed General MacArthur, General Tegor, and General Macknoden, commander-in-chief of the Canadian overseas expeditionary force.

Estimated Number of German Troops Stationed in France

Lisbon (Allied News Agency Telegram) – According to reports from London, the German army moved sixteen regiments, including two mechanized divisions, to the Soviet front line, leaving France almost undefended. Those who believe this statement are mocked by the British military authorities. It is understood that other divisions replaced all the divisions that left France, and the claim that nine divisions remained in the rear is not agreed with. It is estimated that Germany has at least twenty-five divisions stationed in France.

Lisbon, 3rd (Havas Agency Telegram) – Renolzier, a famous American military reporter, wrote in the Ariel magazine on July 18 that attempting to invade Europe is like playing the lottery, and it is difficult to be sure of success. Because Germany can use all materials in France, Norway and other occupied areas, 300,000 well-equipped German troops waiting for work pose a major obstacle to the British and American invasion of Europe. Whether they can be removed is in doubt.

Rome, 3rd (Havas Agency Telegram) – The Roman People's Daily published an exclusive and unconfirmed report from Stockholm yesterday, claiming that Churchill flew to Moscow to meet Stalin, and the situation during the meeting was very tense. Stalin reportedly accused Churchill of abandoning the Soviet Union on the spot. The newspaper added that the Anglo-Soviet agreement has been established for two months, but the United Kingdom has not fulfilled its promises to the Soviet Union, but the United Kingdom itself is indeed unable to do so.

Delicate Relations Between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union

Lisbon, 2nd (Central News Agency Telegram) – The German army's rapid advance on the southern front has made the Soviet Union's demand for the formation of a second front even more urgent. According to a telegram from Moscow, since the outbreak of the German-Soviet war, although the Soviet Union has been in a great crisis, it has been quite silent on the demands of Britain and the United States to land on the European continent. However, all Soviet newspapers on the 2nd unanimously published reports requesting that Britain immediately launch a second front in accordance with the Anglo-Soviet military agreement, and also published detailed reports of speeches and demonstrations in London and New York, in order to prevent the public's morale from wavering. Soviet radio stations have also issued broadcasts saying that we very much hope that the United Nations will launch a new operation. The American magazine "US News" published on July 20 also issued a criticism of the fact that Britain and the United States have been slow to launch a second front, saying that the Soviet Union has only heard various news about the formation of a second front from Britain and the United States, but there has been no actual preparation or action, which has been quite dissatisfied. At this time when the Soviet Union is facing the greatest crisis, rescuing the Soviet army has become the unanimous opinion of the Soviet Union. Therefore, on the issue of the formation of a second front, the Soviet Union's attitude towards Britain and the United States has become more rigid, and the future direction of the three countries may become more delicate as a result.

### Mysterious Egypt (7)

The second type of farmer belongs to the tenant farmer system. Some of them are lifelong long-term workers with relatively generous conditions. In addition to paying a small amount of land rent, they still have a lot of surplus, so their lives are relatively stable. There is also a type of short-term long-term worker who specializes in planting for others. The five to six tenths of the harvest they receive is only enough for daily living expenses. The remaining cotton, in addition to making clothes for themselves, is often insufficient for gifts for many festivals and the celebratory occasions of the landlords. Therefore, a tenant farmer often works for others for four or five years and still ends up with a debt.

General small landowners also suffer a lot. According to the estimate of a French person, M. Legrain, all the property of each small landowner is only worth 48 francs. They only have half a hectare of land, a humble house, a set of furniture, a cow, a bull or a mule, a few chickens and pigeons, a set of farm tools, and an old-fashioned plow in the garden.

As for the large landowners, they are all nobles, and the land rent they squeeze from the farmers is astounding. The purchase price of one hectare of land is only 175 francs, but the land rent collected each year is 500 to 600 francs. This is truly an incredible situation.

The high land rent is due to the rapid increase in population and the large number of farm laborers. The price of manual labor in Egypt is low, and work that is usually done by machines elsewhere is still done manually here, which is also the reason. Secondly, there is too little arable land. In recent years, there have been many improvements to this problem. They often develop wasteland, turning sand sources into sources of wealth.

Egyptian farmers suffer terribly under the landlords' extortion, coupled with the heavy interest exploitation of mortgage loan banks in recent years. Their economic situation can be regarded as the poorest in the world. As for the education and health of farmers, they are also extremely backward as a result.

They mostly live in huts made of sugarcane roots, and one room is often crowded. In addition, there are no windows, making the air very murky. They also suffer from malnutrition and overwork, so the mortality rate is very high. Fortunately, the productivity rate is even greater, so the population can increase daily. However, the child mortality rate is very alarming. Many adults suffer from gastrointestinal diseases due to eating too much corn, and epidemics are also common due to heat waves. In addition, due to wind and sand, the number of people with trachoma reaches 92%, which is certainly the highest in the world. Egypt also has many people with acute conjunctivitis and blindness. Therefore, there are eye hospitals everywhere in Egypt, and the 1937 World Ophthalmology Conference was also held in Cairo, Egypt.

Economic Miscellany

Before Mehemet Ali came to power in Egypt, all the land belonged to the emperor. Some nobles and wealthy people also had some private property, but most of the farmers were working for others. It was not until 1861 that Egypt had the term private land ownership. However, in recent years, the influence of foreigners has spread, and the economic aggression suffered has deepened. More than 34% of all land has been transferred into foreign hands. Farmers generally love their land, so why are they willing to sell their land to foreigners? The story is interesting. It turns out that most Egyptians believe in Islam. According to Islamic rules, believers who lend money to others are not allowed to charge interest. Therefore, wealthy farmers will not lend money to others, and poor farmers have no choice but to borrow from land mortgage loan banks established by foreigners at high interest rates. As a result, they cannot repay the loans when they are due, and the land falls into the hands of others. If the religious rules also prohibited believers from borrowing money from others with interest, the land in Egypt might still belong entirely to Egyptians today.

The Egyptians have also tried to remedy this land problem. For example, during the First World War, some people launched peasant cooperative banks to compete with foreign banks, but the results were still limited.

Before the 18th century, Egypt's monetary system used gold and silver coins, but now all that can be seen are British gold pounds, French francs, and Turkish currencies. If you want to see Egyptian coins, you have to go to a museum.

In 1898, the Egyptian government established a national bank and issued the first Egyptian banknotes. However, because the value of banknotes fluctuated with the amount of domestic cotton production, and the government did not enforce circulation, these banknotes were not seen in the countryside at all, except for circulation in a few large cities. As for the nickel coins issued in 1885, they are still circulating on the market today.

If the financial stability of a country is judged by the amount of its national debt, then Egypt should be a country with poor finances. Its annual revenue is approximately 2 million Egyptian gold coins, but the debt it must repay each year accounts for half of it. Egypt's economic weakness is one of the reasons why it is occupied by foreign powers.

There are many cotton tycoons in the United States. In Egypt, cotton itself is the tycoon. It is not only the tycoon of Egypt, but also the tycoon of all cotton in the world. All economic activities in Egypt depend on it, and the raw materials for clothing in Europe and Africa also depend on it.

### Longtian Maru Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday Morning; British Nationals to Evacuate Today; 324 People Scheduled to Board This Afternoon

The English-language "North China Daily Mail" reports that the Longtian Maru, carrying 454 evacuees from Yokohama, arrived in Shanghai this morning (the 3rd).

### Fifth Installment of Food Rations on Sale Starting Yesterday

Quantity Same as Fourth Installment; Registration Required to Purchase Bread

Rice shops in the two concessions began selling the fifth installment of household rice rations yesterday. It is understood that the total amount of rice and flour allocated to the rice shops for this period is as follows: 414 rice shops in the International Settlement received 16,980 bags of white rice and 45,285 bags of flour; 215 rice shops in the French Concession received 9,980 bags of white rice and 25,725 bags of flour.

Fifth Installment of Food Rations on Sale Yesterday

Yesterday was the first day of sales for the fifth installment of household rice rations. Purchases were made with the fifth coupon, with each coupon allowing the purchase of 1.5 liters of white rice and 0.75 kilograms of flour, sold together for 7.2 yuan in reserve notes. However, the purchase of flour was optional and not compulsory. There was no limit to the number of rice coupons that could be used, and one person could purchase rations on behalf of multiple people.

Remaining "Double Horse" Flour Awaiting Disposal

Rice shops in both concessions have reported a significant surplus of "Double Horse" brand flour allocated by the former Rice and Grain Office, due to the presence of sand. After reporting the stockpiled quantities to the Rice and Grain Office, instructions on how to dispose of it are still pending.

Two Types of Bread Coupons

Residents in both concessions and western Shanghai who have registered to purchase bread are now receiving bread coupons from their respective bakeries, for use when the authorities begin distribution on Friday. Residents who have not received rice coupons are entitled to receive white bread coupons, allowing them to purchase ten ounces (avoirdupois) of bread each day for a month. Those who have received rice coupons are only allowed to receive yellow bread coupons, limiting them to four ounces of bread per day. Separate bread coupons will also be issued to children between the ages of two and five to ensure equitable treatment for all. It is understood that the authorities will ascertain the number of people in each household from the initial bread registration forms.

Issued According to Registered Number of People

If a bread-consuming household has children between the ages of two and five, they can amend their original registration form at the management office at 209 Jiangxi Road. Bakeries will subsequently receive flour from the authorities, and the white or yellow bread coupons that each bakery and its distributors can obtain will also be determined based on the number of people listed on their registration forms. Furthermore, those who were eligible for rice coupons but now wish to obtain bread will be rejected. Those who have never received rice coupons can apply for registration at the Municipal Council Management Office.

### Shanghai Bankers Association Approves Taxation of Hoarded Goods; Warehouse Hoarding Considered a Temporary Profiteering Business; Maximum Tax Rate Limited to 200 Per Mille

The Joint Committee of the Shanghai Bankers Association and its members, in order to assist the authorities in curbing speculation and hoarding, has submitted and passed a resolution to levy a temporary profit tax on goods hoarded in various warehouses and stockpiles, in accordance with regulations. The resolution instructs all firms establishing warehouses and stockpiles to report the types, quantities, dates of entry and exit, and names of owners of stored goods on a bi-weekly basis for taxation purposes. This reporter learned from the Bankers Association that the temporary profit tax refers to income from the buying and selling of goods unrelated to the main business, and not calculated under the income of the main business, is considered a temporary profit business. Therefore, non-business individuals who buy and sell goods for profit are also regarded as temporary profit businesses and taxed according to their income. The tax rates are as follows: 30 per mille for income between 100 yuan and less than 1,000 yuan; 40 per mille for income between 1,000 yuan and less than 2,500 yuan; 60 per mille for income between 2,500 yuan and less than 5,000 yuan; and for income above 5,000 yuan, an additional 10 per mille is levied for each additional 1,000 yuan of income, with the maximum tax rate capped at 200 per mille. Those who withhold income tax or pay income tax themselves must report their income in the prescribed format to the tax authorities within one month of settlement. Failure to report or making false reports will be punished according to law, and in serious cases, may be subject to imprisonment or detention for up to one year.

### Municipal Council Explains Scope of Retail Tax; All Transactions Except Wholesale Subject to Tax

The Municipal Council's Information Office announces that, according to reports, some shops still have unclear understanding of the scope of the 2 per mille retail tax levied by the Bureau on goods. The details are explained as follows:

Wholesale

Large-volume transactions of goods, quantified in loose form or calculated by baskets, packages, bags, etc., are not necessarily wholesale transactions.

A transaction constitutes a wholesale transaction regardless of the quantity of goods if any of the following conditions are met and the buyer intends to resell the goods: Manufacturers or their agents selling goods to formal merchants or retailers engaged in the same type of goods; Transactions between two businesses in the same industry; Manufacturers or merchants selling goods to factories, etc., and these goods are processed into other types of goods through industrial or manual processes. The above three types of transactions are not subject to the retail tax.

Consumption

If a buyer's identity and purpose of purchase are unknown to the seller, such transactions are subject to the retail tax, unless the buyer can provide proof (such as verifying membership in a trade association, etc.) that one of the above three conditions is met to qualify for tax exemption. If a buyer cannot or is unwilling to verify their business status and intention, the buyer should be regarded as a consumer and pay the retail tax accordingly.

Transaction

When a manufacturer or merchant of machinery sells a complete machine or parts to a factory, verification of the buyer's status and intention is extremely important. If the purchased machine, whether complete or partial, is used as part of the factory's equipment, such a transaction, in terms of the retail tax, constitutes a retail transaction and should be taxed accordingly.

In general, merchants should maintain detailed records of the names, addresses, and other information of buyers in all transactions that are wholesale in nature for inspection by the Municipal Council's staff.

### Notice from the Shanghai Bankers Association: Standardization of Bills Issued by Firms

Inconsistent Formats Lead to Repeated Disputes; Subsequent Bills Must Be Written in Uppercase to Show Seriousness

In order to standardize the bills issued by firms, the Shanghai Bankers Association has issued a special notice to its member firms: "To whom it may concern, recently, the numerals on the promissory notes and remittance slips issued by various firms in the industry have often been written in inconsistent formats, leading to repeated disputes and economic inefficiencies in both time and procedures. To remedy this, all firms must write numerals on bills in uppercase (e.g., 'one hundred' as '伯') to ensure standardization and seriousness. We hereby issue this notice for your compliance."

### All Remaining Old Currency Held by Money Exchange Shops Must Be Reported

The Shanghai Money Exchange Association received a notice on the 29th of last month that the carrying of old currency would be prohibited starting August 1st. The Association has recently issued a notice and prepared a "Remaining Old Currency Report Form," which has been distributed to money exchange shops. All money exchange shops must fill out the form in detail, listing the amounts of Central Bank, Bank of China, and miscellaneous banknotes (including banknotes from the Central Agricultural Bank, the Ningbo Commercial Bank, and the Zhongnan Bank), as well as worn and torn banknotes, stored in their vaults and submit it to the Association for disposal.

Notice from Songshan Road Police Station: Radio Registration Period

Since the implementation of radio registration in the French Concession last month, registrations have been extremely enthusiastic. However, the registration was temporarily suspended due to the exhaustion of registration forms, and a notice was issued to reschedule the registration. The police stations have separately notified each Lianbao to instruct residents with radios to register. The Songshan Road Police Station issued a special notice yesterday, ordering households within the 71st to 88th Lianbao to apply for registration between yesterday and the 8th, and those who fail to do so will be punished.

### Rice Shops Fined

On August 1st, the French Concession police discovered the following rice shops in Shanghai engaging in fraudulent practices and irregularities while retailing rice, harming the public interest. Therefore, they were penalized: No. 66 Rue Louban, rice shop No. 577, fined 1,000 yuan; No. 55 Rue du Père Froc, rice shop No. 697, fined 750 yuan; No. 137 Rue du Père Froc, rice shop No. 699, fined 500 yuan; No. 404 Route de Zikawei, rice shop No. 764, fined 500 yuan; No. 94 Rue Amiral Courbet, rice shop No. 611, fined 1,500 yuan; No. 30 Route Marcel Tillot, rice shop No. 643, fined 1,500 yuan; No. 106 Route Wagner, rice shop No. 750, fined 1,500 yuan.

Fire Chief Returns to Post

The Municipal Council Information Office announced that Mr. Little, the Director of the Fire Department, has returned to Shanghai from Hong Kong.

Nightclubs in Both Concessions Request Extension of Business Hours; Authorities Prepare to Consider

Nightclubs and other entertainment venues in both concessions have jointly requested the authorities to permit them to extend their business hours. The Municipal Council and the French Municipal Council are preparing to consider this request. However, the attitude of the two authorities towards this matter is still unpredictable. Recently, the Shanghai Western District Police Department permitted entertainment venues in the district to extend their closing time from 11 PM to 12:30 AM. Therefore, nightclubs in both concessions also intend to follow suit and request the authorities to accommodate them. The outcome will depend on whether the reasons they provide are legitimate.

### Cause of the Careless Fire at Daoxiangcun on Sima Road

At 3:50 PM on the 31st of last month, a fire suddenly broke out on the upper floor of the Daoxiangcun tea and snack shop at No. 383 Fuzhou Road. Due to the early hour, the fire was very fierce. Fortunately, the Fire Brigade made every effort to extinguish it, averting a major disaster. Afterwards, the Laozha Police Station, under the jurisdiction, instructed Detective Zou Bolang to investigate. The investigation revealed that Shao Yikang rented the mezzanine floor of the shop. On the day of the fire, Shao's cousin, Wang Shangmao from Ningbo (who lives at No. 72 Qunyi Lane, Alcok Road), came to visit. As Wang was about to return home, he threw a cigarette butt onto the mezzanine floor. Although he tried to stomp it out with the sole of his shoe, he did not completely extinguish the embers, causing them to ignite the imitation ivory in the area and start the fire, leading to the disaster. The detectives determined that Shao should be held responsible for the fire and arrested him the day before yesterday for further investigation.

Grand Wedding of the Yang and Li Families

The day before yesterday (Sunday), the eldest son of Ms. Yang Nielingyu, the Principal of the Municipal Council Girls' School, Mr. Yang Lukun, married Ms. Li Di, the daughter of the scholar Mr. Li Yingnan, at the YMCA William Public Prayer Hall. The wedding ceremony was conducted with religious rites, solemnly and reverently, with a large number of guests, making it a grand occasion of the time.

### Minister Yokoyama Hosts Shanghai Gentlemen

Minister Yokoyama hosted a banquet for well-known Chinese scholars and celebrities at the International Hotel the night before last. Those attending included Major Asano, Major Yamaga, Lieutenant Koike, and prominent figures in the Shanghai maritime community, Wen Lanting, Yuan Lüdeng, Xu Langxi, Sun Jing, Ni Yichi, Shi Jingge, Lin Jiongan, Gu Zhuxuan, Yang Chonggeng, Chen Sen, Li Shuming, and Li Guohua, totaling over 20 individuals, all introduced by Peng Yunpeng. They gathered together, toasting each other with enthusiasm. The Minister was particularly warm, and they discussed and exchanged views on Chinese culture. The guests and host expressed deep sympathy for the difficulties of the current situation, wishing to alleviate all suffering and enable the people to live and work in peace, making significant contributions to society in the future. After Mr. Yuan gave a speech, they took a photograph and dispersed in good spirits. (The person sitting in the middle of the left picture is Minister Yokoyama).

### Dr. Ding Huikang Saves Banquet Expenses of 10,000 Yuan for Education

This Newspaper Extends Acceptance of Birthday Gifts for One Day; Gifts Sent from Other Ports Will Still Be Accepted

Yesterday was Mr. Ding Fubao's 69th birthday. The number of people from all walks of life who came to the office to offer birthday wishes was almost overwhelming, reaching more than 300, and the amount of gift money was nearly 20,000 yuan, the highest record in the past ten days. This newspaper originally planned to stop accepting gifts yesterday, but in response to requests from all parties and due to procedural matters, the acceptance period has been extended for another day, until 5 PM today. Birthday gifts sent from other ports will still be accepted and announced in the newspaper.

Saving Banquet Expenses

Dr. Ding Huikang, Mr. Fubao's son, is a well-known tuberculosis specialist in Shanghai and the founder of the Hongqiao Sanatorium. He has a strong enthusiasm for tuberculosis prevention, public health, and charitable causes. For his father's birthday, he was instructed not to hold a celebratory banquet, and instead saved 10,000 yuan to benefit relatives and friends. This amount was sent to this newspaper yesterday to be donated to social causes. His enthusiasm and filial piety are admirable.

### University Graduation

— Zongyi

This year, it ended earlier than usual, completing the academic program in May. This month was busy with the final exams, typing out theses day and night, and rushing to take graduation photos. Donning the square cap and raising one's head made one feel even more impressive than a PhD. In addition, there were farewell parties and tea parties, with students treating professors one day, professors treating students the next, and students treating students the day after. It was incredibly busy. Finally, everything was finished, and a temporary graduation certificate was in hand. However, the saying "graduation is unemployment" immediately loomed over our heads. Naturally, the first important thing after graduation is to find a job. Now, a month has passed like flowing water, and classmates have dispersed, each going their own way. Fortunately, more than a dozen bachelors of science from the Chemistry Department have not left Shanghai. Now, let me tell you about the recent experiences of some of these university graduates:

Take Lao Liu, for example. He was the oldest in the department, hence the nickname "Lao" (Old). Lao Liu's family circumstances are quite good. Although his father passed away, he inherited a considerable sum of money. He didn't study chemistry in vain. Now, he has opened a ×× Western pharmacy, specializing in buying and selling things like Uleron, Dajianhuang, and other Western medicines that are hard to pronounce, like Opatal, Prontosil, and Cibazol... Fortunately, he has a knack for making money. It is said that he earned over 70,000 on Shuangtao quinine alone. No wonder he recently treated several of us old classmates to tea at DD, S!

Guo Laofuzi (Old Master Guo) is called that because he usually continued his studies with stability and was very prudent, so he has the title of Old Master. Now, Guo Laofuzi has left his field and started doing business at the exchange. All day long, he's busy with Shuangma, Xiantao, Tongzijun factory orders, and what kind of Longtou, Feiyu, Sijunzi stack orders, also dealing in military bonds and stock market prices, so he's so busy that you can't even see his shadow. When you go to his house to find Old Master Guo, five or six times they say, "The young master has gone to the company." What kind of company it is, I don't know.

Now, those with money do big business, those with less money do small business, adults do business, and even children do business. Shanghai has become a "business world." Like Xiao Wang, he has brand-new ideas. With a flash of inspiration, he thought that summer is here, and there are so many people riding bicycles now, so the straw hat business is worth doing. So, he picked up his own old bicycle and ran around, selling large and small straw hats. From the most beautiful straw hats worn by foreigners to the most common Ningbo salt straw hats, they are piled up in a small room. He sews the ribbons himself, applies the colorful colors himself, delivers the goods himself, and acts as the manager himself. He also uses the money he earns himself. After a day of hard work, in addition to eating three full meals, he can also have pocket money for snacks and watch a movie. Now, he even has new suits, new shirts, and new leather shoes.

There are those who embrace optimism and those who embrace pessimism. Like our Dr. Zheng, he has the biggest ambition. He plans to have four sulfuric acid factories, two caustic soda factories, one large gas factory, and five chemical raw material companies in the future. He usually considers himself a doctor because of his profound knowledge. If you ask him why the sulfuric acid factory and caustic soda factory haven't been built yet, his answer is, "Now there are no foreign raw materials, now there are no foreign machines, how can I build a factory!" Maybe his knowledge is too broad, so he must have foreign goods to supplement it. He didn't think that foreign machines and raw materials are made by people. Now, the chemical concerto of the doctor has come to an end, and he is singing a love song. Unfortunately, the doctor is very good at learning, but he has no deep research on love. Now he has suffered a broken heart. The other party refused him because "love is not dedicated." The doctor had no choice but to sever ties from then on and finally became pessimistic, sleeping in in the morning and setting up a small fortune-telling stall in the Dahua air-conditioned dance hall in the afternoon, spending the whole day with a cup of tea.

There are also several female generals in the Chemistry Department. It is strange that the female generals are always better than the male students in their studies. Like our Miss Liu, she has an excellent memory and is the first in her studies. Almost all of her grades are A's. They live on Yuyuan Road, which is very close to "Wellcome and Evian." These days are really full of memories!

Ah, I forgot an important figure – A Zhang – he has served as the president of the Chemistry Association many times. He is popular among students and quite favored by professors, so students are very close to him and familiarly call him A Zhang. Now, "the wind has turned the sails." The other day, I saw him busy at the racecourse with a red card hanging around his neck, sometimes winning with number four, sometimes betting on a double of three and four, sometimes playing the lottery, which was enough to keep him busy all day. Now that the horse racing is over for the summer, he has gone to the dog racing track and the jai alai court. He spends the whole afternoon immersed in the names of people like Aranguren, Cubalong, Astier Olano... and the names of dogs like Mister Beer, Craford Fornelia, Wood Stoker Irving...

University graduation is such a moving term! University students are the backbone of society. At the same time, people in a chemistry department have "different sacred careers." As for how they are to society, I dare not criticize, let alone draw conclusions. I only hope that they remember that society needs talent, and even more so, university talent. At the same time, I hope they look up to themselves and respect themselves.

### Anonymous Elderly Man Generously Benefits the Poor

Donated and Raised Huge Sums of Money

Our newspaper's third reader scholarship fund received a generous donation of 2,000 yuan yesterday from an anonymous elderly man, and 1,000 yuan raised by Father.

He also generously donated a large sum of money for the second scholarship fund and gave many instructions on the direction of the scholarship. Not only are the colleagues of our newspaper deeply grateful, but also countless poor students are grateful. Now, we are grateful to the elderly man for his third donation, which has greatly increased the scholarship fund. Such an elderly man is worthy of being a role model for readers. We are also deeply grateful to Mr. Qian Junchuan for raising 1,000 yuan through an anonymous person.

### Person Involved in Jinxiuzhai Case Dies in Prison

Jin Yin'gen, the owner of Changxing Flower Shop at No. 519 Xiafei Road, Pudong, had a dispute with Wang Weiyuan, the owner of Jinxiuzhai Jewelry Store at No. 521 Kunling Road. It was decided that late at night on June 27, he would wield a knife, climb over the wall, and break into the Jinxiuzhai pavilion to kill Wang. Wang happened to be going to Su the next day, so he was spared. He killed Wang's five-year-old adopted son, Wang Mian, and tried to rape Wang's sixteen-year-old adopted daughter, Qu Huide, but failed. He stabbed Qu. After the case occurred, Jin was arrested by the French Concession Police and sent to court for detention.

### Gateball Charity Match Invites Eight Men's and Women's Teams to Participate

Opening Order to be Announced Soon

The Changyin Cup Gateball Charity Match has been progressing smoothly since the establishment of the league committee. Five men's teams, including Youlian, Nanyang, Huanan, Tongren, and Zhonglian, and three women's teams, including Youdui, Aiguo, and Lingsheng, are invited to participate in the competition. The elimination system is adopted. The opening ceremony is scheduled to be held at Guangxia Middle School this Sunday (9th) afternoon. The strength of the four men's teams is very even. Nanyang recently won the first Guobin Cup Gateball Championship, and its momentum is strong. Although Huanan was the runner-up in the cup competition, the match against Nanyang was a 2-2 draw, so its strength is no less than Nanyang's. Youlian is a newly emerging organization, but it has a history of several years in the basketball world. This time, it is rising again, with a strong lineup and the same prestige as before. Tongren, known as the Xuan family class, dominates the basketball world and is as famous as Huanan. It is also one of the strong teams. At that time, the four strong teams will compete for the championship, which will be exciting and tense. The ticket sales have been good since the beginning. Yesterday, Zhao Yinsheng of Shengsheng Company purchased 100 honorary tickets, totaling 500 yuan, and Cheng Ying, the red dancer of Paramount, purchased 100 tickets, totaling 500 yuan. As for the opening order, it will be arranged and announced within days.

### Talking about Wang Tao's Letters

Wang Tao's Letters 7, a total of eighteen pages, have been mounted into a post. I obtained it from the used bookstore on Kader Road for 30 yuan in Central Reserve Certificates. It is as joyful as finding gold by sifting sand (from the "Used Bookstore" article on the 22nd), which must be recorded.

Wang, from Changzhou, Qing Dynasty, styled Ziquan, sobriquet Ziju, father styled Zhongtao, another sobriquet Tiannan Dun Sou. Capable in poetry, skilled in parallel prose. During the Xianfeng and Tongzhi periods, he was an official in Guangdong, and communicated with Hong Yang. After Hong Yang pacified Jinling, he opened the imperial examinations to recruit scholars. Wang took the examination and obtained the first place, which surprised people at the time. After Hong Yang was defeated, he fled to Hong Kong and founded the Circulation Daily. Then he traveled to Europe and the United States, and personally witnessed the Franco-Prussian War. He wrote the Franco-Prussian War Record. He then traveled to Japan and wrote the Fuso Travelogue. During the Guangxu period, he returned to Shanghai and lectured at the Gezhi Academy. He wrote the Taoyuan Anthology, Yingru Magazine, Songyin Manlu, and Yongyou Yutan.

These seven letters contain about three thousand words, including eight poems. The paper and ink are very exquisite. He wrote a handwritten collection of Wang Xizhi's Sacred Teachings Preface. It was given to his friend Wu Guangxu. Wu's life is unknown, but it can only be known from the letter that his name is Hao. He once followed Huang Gongdu, a Sichuan envoy to Japan, and worked as a counselor. He had a very deep relationship with Wang Tao, or even a sworn brotherhood. In several letters, Wang referred to himself as his younger brother and Wu as his elder brother.

Most people regard Zhu Tao as a monster of the late Qing Dynasty, largely because he was born as a Taiping Rebellion champion. In the past, Jian Youwen (i.e., Dahua, martyr) and Xie Yuyao were in Shanghai. Both of them were experts in the study of the Taiping Rebellion historical materials. The reporter accidentally talked about this person with them, and they unanimously believed that Wang was just a scholar in his true colors, with arrogance. He thought he had a belly full of knowledge that was in line with the current evils, but no one paid attention to him, so he could not help but become indignant, and he and Su Dongpo, Wang Anshi, and others were all of the same kind. At that time, the reporter was ashamed of his shallow knowledge. I could only agree. Now, after carefully reading Wang's letters, I know that the two people's criticism of the characters is truly insightful.

Wang likes to scold people. In just seven letters, the pen touched Huang Gongdu, Ma Xiangbo, Ma Meishu, and Li Hongzhang. These are all figures with a reputation for a generation, and they all have shortcomings in his eyes. The most severely scolded person is Li Hongzhang, who said: "He is full of vulgar bones, has the face of an official, is superficial and frivolous, and has no ink in his chest." Criticizing Huang Gongdu said: "Since Gongdu took office in Jinshan, his political reputation is good. I love his talent but despise his person, because his heart is deep and he has the wind of a cat laughing at scales. It is not something that people like me who are bright and upright can say. If he gains power and changes his behavior one day, he will also be Wang Qinruo's type! Alas, how terrible!" Frankly speaking, Li Huang is naturally not worthy of being called a perfect person, but as he said, it seems too much. From this, one can imagine a glimpse of Wang's madness.

People who like to scold people mostly consider themselves extraordinary. He is not only self-confident, but also extremely enthusiastic, and sometimes even thinks that he can turn the world around with his own hands. In Guangxu's Renwu year (1882), France sent troops to Vietnam and started a war with us. The Qing government, with its weak power, intended to retreat and ordered Ma Meishu to take on the responsibility of defense. In a letter to Wu, he expressed distrust that Ma could win this negotiation. "Now the Vietnam matter, the peace and war are still undecided, but as I see it, the French may not dare to completely break off our friendship, nor may they be willing to give up their land. It will probably still end with France returning the city captured in Vietnam, Vietnam compensating France for the cost of raising troops, and theoretically they are wrong and we are right, and in terms of momentum they are far away and we are near. With Meishu's talent, taking on this important task, whether he can transform their conflict into friendship and eliminate the disaster invisibly, I secretly doubt it..." The tone is straightforward, and there is a strong "Let me do it" meaning. In the nineteenth year of Guangxu, Wang's enthusiastic emotions had probably reached a fever pitch. He claimed: "I have been studying soldiers for ten years, and I have not established a name. I have a full heart of enthusiasm, and I intend to take this opportunity to spit it out." The last paragraph: "If the authorities pity talent as my brother said, there are still unsaid words, and the anger that fills my chest will be detailed." A enthusiasm for volunteering is vividly on paper.

Here, the reporter has many feelings. There is a saying: "A scholar rebels, and nothing will be achieved in three years," which is really a supreme truth. Scholars' knowledge is mostly obtained from books, and they have little practical experience. Even if they speak logically, they are still just talking on paper. After the middle of the Qing Dynasty, after experiencing changes, the court and the people formed fire and water. The ignorant and incompetent people in power are certainly unbearable, but what good have the narrow-minded people done to the cause.

It is inevitable for a scholar to be out of touch with the times and to be poor. Wang was poor and so poor that he was helpless. One letter said that he lacked money for medicine and asked Wu for a loan of forty fans. The small amount of forty fans could not be obtained locally and had to be appealed to thousands of miles away (Wu was working in Japan at the time), which could not but be regarded as a pitiful act. It is useless to be a scholar, which is a sigh throughout the ages. (Recorded by Pan Zhuxin in July of the thirty-first year of the Republic of China)

Commercial News

### Public Debt Investment is Gradually Becoming More Active

Yesterday, the dark market for public debt continued to rise, because there were still many buyers. The market price was still slowly rising step by step. Unfortunately, due to the tight money supply and high overnight rates, it was inevitably hindered. Therefore, there were still many floating sellers. Otherwise, it would not be difficult for Class C to break through the 40 yuan mark. Because investment business only has bond business after being controlled. Recently, stock trading has suddenly become deserted, with mostly sellers and few buyers. Therefore, only the public debt market can still be openly traded. Investors gather here and buy in unison. They have not retreated for many days. Runde, Shuntai, Dazhong, Hefeng, Lianyi, etc. also have absorption, with many short accounts. Runli, Tongshun, Hu Heji, Tongkang, etc. also have selling accounts. As a result, it rose by 5 jiao to 7 jiao. The turnover was about 2.5 million yuan. A concise table is listed below:

### Although New Buyers are Active, the Declining Trend of Chinese Stocks is Difficult to Reverse

Yesterday, although new buyers were active in the Chinese stock market, it was difficult to reverse the declining trend of the past two weeks. The market prices of various stocks were still difficult to recover, and the situation turned into a stalemate. It seems that there is more floating capital, and a part of the subscription for new stocks is more interested.

In the new pharmaceutical industry, Zhongfa broke into the 80 yuan mark and rose by 3 yuan, Xinya fell by 7 jiao and 5 fen, the Shui'an officials such as Minyi, the Zhabei water and electricity fell by one yuan, and there was no color. Huashang Electrical Appliance was stable and firm, and Nanyang Tobacco Company retreated by 2 jiao. According to the people's hearts, fatigue has turned to stability. Now, the market price table of each stock is recorded separately.

Jin Zongcheng and other giants in the city's financial industry have recently organized Yihua Real Estate Co., Ltd. The total capital is 5 million yuan in Central Reserve Certificates, divided into 500,000 shares, each share is 10 yuan. The preparatory office is located at No. 415, 6th Floor, No. 429 Jiujiang Road. In addition to the original promoters identifying 4 million yuan, the remaining 1 million yuan is publicly recruited. From now on, the Wuzhou China Industrial Encouragement Great Wall Shanghai Iron Industry Four Banks are entrusted to collect the stock funds. It is said that the subscribers are very enthusiastic, that is, the amount is sufficient.

### Gold Jewelry is Listed at a Loss of 50 Yuan

The price was slightly lower among the industry, with the morning price being 1,940 yuan per tael, 20 yuan lower. Soon, it was elevated by a certain household to 1,565 yuan. Those who sought to sell rose again and again, and the price fell again. At noon, it was 1,940 yuan, 20 yuan lower than the price last Saturday, with a difference of 25 yuan. The transaction was clear and insignificant. As for the jewelry sterling silver, it was still listed at 16 yuan per tael. The price among the industry was 11 yuan and 45 jiao.

### Military Tickets are Perfectly Balanced

Yesterday, the foreign currency market, Japanese military tickets remained stable and less volatile. The industry's entry and exit price was 5 yuan, 5 jiao, 5 fen to 5 fen and 2 li. Later, it was the entry price for operators. The entry price for banks and money shops was 5 yuan, 5 jiao, 4 fen and 5 fen to 5 fen and a half. The entry and exit in the market was even more insignificant.

### Cotton Cloth Not Scarce – Resolving with Pain

Market Prices Plummeted Severely

Yesterday, the cloth market declined sharply. As people's hearts were extremely weak, buyers resolutely cut their losses. "Dragon Head" fine cloth, new, opened at one hundred seventy-five yuan and five jiao, and closed at one hundred seventy-one yuan. Also, "Bank" cloth was fifty-one yuan and five jiao, "Color Ball" fine cloth was one hundred fifty-four yuan and five jiao, "Flying Fish" fine cloth was one hundred fifty-two yuan, and "Four Gentlemen" serge fell sharply to six yuan and six jiao.

Retail sales of beans were slightly active yesterday, with the market showing a slightly firmer trend. Fifty bags of Tianjin broad beans opened at two hundred twenty-eight yuan, and twenty bags of red beans opened at one hundred sixty-eight yuan. One hundred twenty bags of Chongming sand silkworm beans were priced at one hundred ten to one hundred twelve yuan, and substandard goods were one hundred five yuan.

Xin Jin Vegetable Market Slightly Loosened

The southern transport area for Xin Jin vegetables from Xuzhou is temporarily limited to Shanghai. The return of goods has also been confirmed. However, there are no clear regulations for Nanjing, so the needs of the Nanjing market are temporarily purchased from Zhenjiang. Therefore, the Zhenjiang market tightened again after being relaxed. It once reached four hundred yuan. Yesterday's telegram showed a slight relaxation of ten or twenty yuan, but the situation for Shanghai-bound shipments remains precarious. Dealers are observing and not acting. The subsequent purchase here has a firmness within the softness, and yesterday's requests to open were made.

### Sugar Stocks Slightly Loose

Yesterday, the sugar stock single at the Cooperative Business Office showed a gradual slight decline due to sluggish trading. Coarse sugar stocks opened at three hundred and two yuan, then fell to three hundred and one yuan, and closed even lower at three hundred yuan and five jiao, a drop of two yuan. There were quoted prices for brown sugar stocks, but no transactions were made.

### Soap Prices Plunge as Industry Peers Sell Goods at Par

The market situation for daily-use soap suddenly entered a downturn. This was due to a joint announcement by a factory to sell at half price to industry peers. Not exceeding the price limit caused people's hearts to suddenly become weak. Those holding goods were eager to sell, and market prices fell extremely. Gu Ben soap was two hundred and twenty yuan, Bai Xiangmao soap was two hundred and forty yuan, Huang Xiangmao soap was two hundred yuan, and Arrow Knife soap was two hundred and seventy yuan, all plunging by a huge fifteen yuan. Matches also tended to soften. Phoenix brand was two thousand seven hundred yuan, Beautiful brand was two thousand six hundred yuan, Golden Tripod brand was two thousand six hundred yuan, and miscellaneous brands were two thousand two hundred yuan, all following down by fifty yuan. 洋燭 (likely candles) were still one hundred twenty-five yuan for semi-white Tishi, one hundred twenty yuan for Monk's Hat brand, and ninety-five yuan for miscellaneous brands, with prices but no market.

### Black and Gray Woolen Fabrics Show Brisk Sales

Black and gray woolen fabrics have been quite brisk recently. The available stock is lacking, and demand is relatively high, leading to a favorable market trend. In terms of price, black and gray overcoat wool, black and gray Yves wool, and black and gray suit wool, various kinds of woolen black and gray colors, are all trending firm and brisk in the market. Large wholesalers are all hoarding. It is observed that Japanese people prefer to wear these black and gray colors, and recently, many Chinese people are also specifically buying them, creating a supply shortage for black and gray woolen fabrics.

### Pufferfish

— Mo Ran

People know that pufferfish is delicious; those who have eaten it feel that "after eating pufferfish, everything else tastes bland." However, pufferfish is poisonous, so some say, "Risk your life to eat pufferfish."

For years, those who have manipulated prices and hoarded goods have been like eating pufferfish. No legitimate business offers the generous profits that hoarders and manipulators enjoy. Even today, they dream of the deliciousness of pufferfish, but with the strictness of current prohibitions, hoarders who still want to eat pufferfish are simply courting disaster.

We have long worried about these pufferfish eaters, but the consumption of pufferfish has spread from the head of the household to wives, daughters, and even teenagers, and elderly servants are also involved in hoarding. Only now do they realize that pufferfish is poisonous. Once ingested, even with enemas, suffering is unavoidable. Therefore, we hope that those who have not eaten pufferfish will be careful.

"Vegetables from the garden are even more precious than delicacies." Please do not eat pufferfish!

### Rather "Increase Income" Than "Cut Expenses"

— Yi Qing

Opening the page of today's life, you wouldn't have imagined it five or six years ago, and even today last year, when everyone was struggling under the burden of coping with difficulties in life, no one expected the cost of living to soar to what it is today. If they could have imagined it, they would have wondered how they could survive.

Now, the high cost of living is a reality that everyone experiences. Everyone is still alive, except for a very small number who have seized opportunities and are living even more luxuriously than five or six years ago. It is easy to understand that millions are barely able to breathe under this high pressure.

Sighing and thinking about "the beginning" from memories is just looking for trouble. Dreaming of a "dream-like" future is even more boring. To live, the way of life needs to be reviewed.

The meaning of this sentence, simply explained, is that if you feel that your current life is difficult (and it certainly is), you must first ask yourself if you are willing to endure this difficulty. Otherwise, you should think of a way.

We often hear this said: Life is too difficult, we should "cut expenses" a little.

Of course, economically "cutting expenses" may be a way to make life less difficult. However, thoroughly analyzed, it is too passive. In today's high-pressure living environment, most people are already living the bare minimum and most difficult life, so there is really nothing left to "cut." Even if you can "cut expenses," how much can you cut? Moreover, the cost of living is rising all the time, making it impossible for you to "cut" anything.

Therefore, cutting expenses is not a good way to actively alleviate the difficulties of life. My opinion is:——

Rather than "cutting expenses," it is better to "increase income"!

When you read this, you will immediately retort: Since there is nothing left to "cut," is there any "source" to "increase"?

True, on the surface, although there is nothing to "cut," you can at least "cut" a little. "Increasing income" is not something that can be done everywhere, I understand that. The reason I say this is that, in any case, "increasing income" is an active way to alleviate the difficulties of life.

Let me give you an example: You are a married couple. When you feel that your monthly salary is not enough to support a small family, you try to send your wife back to your hometown. This belongs to the "cutting expenses" route, which is passive. But you should know that your wife still needs to live when she returns home, and your own life may not necessarily become more stable. If you "increase income," it should be like this: your wife also dedicates herself to society and finds work (wives without ability or knowledge may no longer exist in our group). This will not only improve your living environment, but also enhance your wife's social experience.

This is just an example. In short, the main purpose of "increasing income" is to strengthen labor force, which is broader in scope than "cutting expenses." Whether direct or indirect, it is active and helps society's construction and productivity, in addition to the individual.

### Not a Day Can

— Huang Shan

There is not a day that I can not smile.

There is not a day that I can not read.

There is not a day that I can be disconnected from friends.

There is not a day that can pass uneventfully, but I should live in a way that satisfies myself. From "Seeking Self Collection"

### A Little Girl

— Lu Yi

Friend! Aren't you saying that the little girl who is staring blankly at the window seems to have something on her mind? That's right! She has something on her mind. —In a few hours, she will be forced to do something she doesn't want to do: that is, to fall into prostitution, into a pit of fire. Don't be surprised, please sit down and let me give you a detailed account. You have asked about her many times, and today I should give you a satisfactory answer.

Aren't you suspicious that the one she calls "Mama" is not her biological mother? That's right. She was originally from the countryside. She came to Shanghai as a refugee. Four years ago, her biological mother sold her to a prostitute for a price of one hundred and fifty yuan and a term of six years to be a foster daughter. Soon, this prostitute was hired by a comprador named Liang Zhu, and borrowed the upper floor of our building as a golden house to hide her beauty. That is Mr. Chen, who comes by chartered car every Saturday, and her current Mama, she lives here as a foster daughter.

You asked about the situation in her hometown? Her hometown originally ran a candy store, and now they are gradually restoring their former situation. She has an older brother who often writes to her, hoping that she will go back. But her sale period is still two years away, and the redemption price for the years not yet served must include the losses of past food, lodging, and clothing. I'm afraid that a small candy store is not enough! Oh, you say that eating and playing like this is more comfortable than living in the countryside? She doesn't think so. At her age, she should already have a family concept, and besides, she has studied. She knows from books that her current position will not be respected.

Endure for two years? Aren't you saying that she only needs to endure until she completes her term as a foster daughter? Alas, the reality is not that simple! Her "Mama" is a ruthless old prostitute, and a outdated comprador is not providing enough for her expenses. So, she doesn't forget her roots and prepares to return to her old business. To avoid the comprador's interference, she uses this little girl as capital to invest in cooperation with others, In the "business," she is retiring from the "manager" position to become a "director." That's right! That is to make this little girl a prostitute. Tomorrow, it will happen tomorrow!

Save her? You blame me for standing by and not helping? Alas, although the girl has expressed a desire for help to me, without substantial economic power, how can I fulfill my due obligations?

She once asked me if I would ridicule her or despise her. Do you know how I answered her? I said: I can only ridicule myself and despise myself, because I am a human being, and I cannot save another human being. Do you think I am right?

What? You say this is also a social problem. Friend, whenever you are dissatisfied with reality, you always call it a problem with a broad name, thinking that you can escape your responsibilities. But I cannot agree. When things in the universe have an impact on humanity, it is the responsibility of humanity itself, especially the human community. We cannot save her, but we cannot abandon our responsibility as human beings, what do you think? (Proceeds go to scholarship fund)

### Congratulating Shou Juan

— Zhang Mengzhao

Busy not with writing but with flowers. Unique craftsmanship, created by hand. The garden is named "Fragrant Snow", full of poetic meaning. Good scenery near Carter Road.

A touch of red in the green. Azaleas bloom every day. Strolling in the fragrant garden is truly a pleasure. Completely forgetting the chaos in the world. Are there beauties like jade in books? Butterflies are in love with fragrant shadows. Are there houses of gold in books? May you be blessed with money from planting flowers.

### What Books to Read

— Jie Ren

We must understand the truth, guide social improvement, and create great undertakings. We must first obtain real knowledge; to obtain real knowledge, we can only seek it in books. Human knowledge is progressing every day, and if you don't try to keep up, you will fall behind. It is especially important to cultivate the habit of reading and to seek interest in knowledge.

The books in the world worth reading are truly as vast as the sea. Zhuangzi said: "My life has a limit, but knowledge has no limit. To pursue the unlimited with the limited is dangerous!" If you don't choose carefully, it is impossible in terms of economic time and spirit.

What books should we read?

In terms of personal cultivation: we should read biographies of great people from all over the world, so that we can learn the right way to strive and work hard in life from the lives of past great people, and indirectly transform your life and career achievements.

In terms of business: you must read books related to your own business, and gain more knowledge in your field. This is especially important for young professionals. The knowledge acquired in school is mostly general, so when you first enter society, you feel that your knowledge is lacking and not practical. People engaged in professional occupations must use their spare time to do research and exploration work to improve their business knowledge and work ability in order to improve and succeed.

As for leisure education: you should read more appreciative books to increase mental pleasure, so that you can truly understand the meaning of life, and can guide people to progress towards a happier path.

Mr. Hu Shih said: "We should read more books, no matter what books we read. Often a very ordinary book contains a very big hint." People's lives are now very busy, and there is not enough time to read, especially for part-time readers, time is infinitely precious to them, so they must spend the least amount of time reading the most useful books, and use the least amount of energy to obtain the greatest effect.

### Sharing the Same Boat in Storms

— He Jia Zhi

(Seven) — Swift Thunder

Wei Cheng said, "Probably after eating these things of theirs, more trouble came later." Mrs. Ye Er said, "Originally, your father's wedding date was set for September of next year, but as a result, your mother was married over in December of that year. Do you know why? First, after the Li family and the Ye family became related, another family came out of nowhere to propose marriage to the Li family. This matter spread from one to ten, ten to a hundred, and everyone knew about it far and wide. Secondly, after those two strange matchmakers came, one night, the Li family suddenly suffered a robbery. When the robbers entered the house, they didn't rob anything, they didn't want money, they only asked who was Miss Li Mingyun. Coincidentally, your mother was sending a cousin back and stayed at her cousin's house that night and was not harmed. Thirdly, after this bizarre robbery case occurred in the Li family, less than ten days later, two old women, with yellow cloth bags on their backs, pretended to be begging for alms, but they stared at your mother with dead eyes, and your mother's heart jumped violently. Your grandmother felt that once, twice, three times, Cheng Bing was behind it all, and she was very uneasy. Therefore, she urged this side to get married early, hoping that everything would be fine from then on. Who knew that in the months before the wedding, and for nearly a year after the marriage, your mother received several letters, all written by Cheng Bing. One letter stated that he had called off his engagement to his original fiancee for your mother's sake, spent countless sums of money for your mother's sake, and that his face was haggard, his spirit was haggard, and he simply asked your mother to stand under a big locust tree outside the village on a certain night, and someone would come to pick her up. Your mother naturally burned the letter. In later letters, Cheng Bing used the name of a woman and called your mother a sister. Some of these letters fell into your father's hands. Your father was a meticulous person and found it very strange that this sister was so busy writing letters, so he asked your mother. Your mother was loyal to her husband and told her husband the whole story. Your father was so angry that he almost lost it, and immediately went to Ant Mound Town to visit. It is said that your father met Cheng Bing, and after a few words, he came back and told your mother. Your mother only advised him to let things rest? But later disasters were thus sown."

Life Snippets

### The Hardships of Home

— Zhi Yin

My wife had always yearned for Shanghai. It was not until November of last year that her dream came true, but it was after several difficult and dangerous journeys that she arrived in Shanghai.

At that time, a triumphant smile appeared on her haggard face, but her painful emotions stimulated me. To live in Shanghai, I estimated that the financial burden would be at least twice as much as living in the countryside. For example, in the countryside, we had our own house, and we could also chop some firewood from our own mountain as fuel, and we could often cut vegetables from our own vegetable garden... But now, the house, coal briquettes, vegetables, and even tap water and emptying the chamber pot... everything had to be paid for.

Bearing the heavy burden, I first found a place to live with the utmost difficulty, and then bought some furniture and utensils. A home was barely established. I thought that we could depend on each other from now on and share happiness and hardship. Unexpectedly, life after that was not as stable as my wife had imagined. Indeed, there was the prosperity she yearned for, but besides watching the rush of streetcars and cars, the tall buildings standing on the horizon, and listening to the unfamiliar jazz music on the radio... what else could she experience? Abandoned babies by the trash cans, corpses on the open roads... these were the sad scenes she had seen after coming to Shanghai, she once told me this.

Moreover, it can be said that rice, coal briquettes, and other daily necessities were becoming increasingly difficult to obtain. In fact, even if they could be obtained with difficulty, the rate of increase in economic levels was really beyond what I could bear. I had to reconsider the possibility of continuing to live in Shanghai. After considering the results, I felt that the only thing to do was to have my wife return to her hometown.

My wife was very understanding of our current situation. Although she was very unwilling emotionally, she finally painfully agreed.

Three months ago, I sent my wife, with her melancholy face, back to her hometown's wharf.

Coming and going in a hurry, I was deeply saddened by the teasing of life, which caused endless depression, but when I thought that the burden of life should be lightened from now on, I couldn't help but feel a sigh of relief.

But for the past three months, the letters from my wife that had been sent one after another still brought me heavy depression. She told me, almost resentfully:

"...You were wrong! Back in the countryside, we don't have to pay rent for the house, but the taxes here and there can be worth the rent of a three-story building in Shanghai. Yes, fuel doesn't need to be bought, but some of the firewood in the mountains has been stolen, so the family still needs to spend money to buy firewood for fuel, and the price is similar to that of coal briquettes, except that there is no need to squeeze and jostle as in Shanghai. Oh, I'll tell you, the price of rice here is also rising rapidly, and now it also costs five hundred yuan per stone. Oil, salt, cloth... which one is not rising day and night? In short, I am now living in the countryside, and the consumption is about the same as when I lived in Shanghai last year. It's not a penny less, so I still want to move the home back to Shanghai..." "I still want to go back to Shanghai!" I was really afraid of the family returning to Shanghai. The changes in my hometown in the past few months were beyond my expectations, but my wife didn't know that Shanghai was no longer the Shanghai of three months ago!

I told my wife: "Let us endure the hardships again! Today's Shanghai is probably completely different from the Shanghai you had contact with! No matter what it is, the cost of living here is obviously two or three times higher than it was three months ago! Therefore, I beg you, don't have the idea of coming out again..."

Thinking of the suffering family, under the heavy burden of life, I couldn't help but feel at a loss.

### Life

— Yin Yu

Prices are rising, life is difficult, cholera is prevalent... Life is as fragile as a piece of thin paper.

Even young people are shaking their heads and sighing, some are shouting "bored," and some are indulging in pleasure.

Shouting bored and indulging in pleasure are wasting life.

Life is indeed fragile, but should it be wasted?

I remembered what the protagonist in a novel said:

"What is most precious to a person is life, and life is only once for us. A person's life should be lived like this: when he looks back on the past, he will not regret wasting his years, nor will he be ashamed of his past mediocrity."
