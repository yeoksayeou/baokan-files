Tokyo, 5th (Central News Agency)

The Yomiuri Hochi newspaper recently published a dispatch from Zurich stating that German forces advancing on Stalingrad are pushing towards the city center from both the north and south, gradually shrinking the encirclement. The German forces' strength has significantly increased compared to several days ago. The newspaper also cited a special Berlin dispatch stating that the German offensive in Kerch is becoming increasingly fierce, and military experts from both Allied and Axis nations believe that the battle for Stalingrad has reached its final stage. Strong German forces have broken into the northern factory area of Stalingrad and occupied the second largest tank factory in the Soviet Union. Another special Berlin dispatch stated that for the final attack on Stalingrad, German forces are steadily advancing westward into the city and deploying a large force of 20 divisions in the Don River bend, waiting for an opportunity to strike. German military authorities believe that after the fall of Stalingrad, Soviet forces in the Caucasus will be isolated, and control over Astrakhan and the port of Baku will also be within reach. At that time, German attacks on Moscow and the mopping-up operations against Soviet forces in the Voronezh region will also become easier.

Berlin, 1st (Havas)

The German High Command announced this morning that German forces in the northern part of Stalingrad have occupied several more areas after fierce street fighting. Soviet troops suffered heavy casualties, and nine tanks were destroyed. In the northwest Caucasus, German forces, assisted by a large number of aircraft, have driven the defending troops out of their positions.

Stockholm, 5th (Havas)

In the Caucasus, German forces are now only 25 miles from the city of Ordzhonikidze, but German operations in the area are very difficult. In the eleven days since last month's 24th, they have only advanced 30 miles. The defenders of Ordzhonikidze are fortifying the city's perimeter and defending the road leading to the city, which is not difficult as the road follows the Terek River, flanked by high mountains. The importance of Ordzhonikidze lies in two factors: first, it is an important industrial area with steel mills and oil refineries; second, it is the starting point of the main road to Tbilisi. According to Soviet reports, German forces have brought in fresh troops to the north of Stalingrad, with thousands being transported by air. The Soviet side has acknowledged abandoning some ruins and buildings in the area, with gains and losses occurring up to ten times a day. As for Voronezh, it is reported that Soviet forces broke through German lines with a surprise attack, causing German losses of 1,800 men in a single day.

Vichy, 4th (Havas)

British Prime Minister Churchill recently made a speech in the House of Commons regarding the Madagascar Island incident, stating that the French forces there only put up symbolic resistance. We have just received a telegram from Governor General Anet of Madagascar Island, refuting Churchill's statement, saying that the British Prime Minister's statement is obviously intended to confuse the public. If the facts were as he stated, why would the British have suffered such heavy losses? Furthermore, if the responsibility for the lives of the residents should be borne by the defending troops, why would civilians be massacred and ambulances be fired upon? It is true that the defending troops are weak and poorly equipped, but everyone has done their best to prevent the British forces from advancing. I recently inspected the front lines and saw that our soldiers looked calm. Although they have been fighting hard for ten days and are mentally exhausted, their determination to resist aggression is still evident. I truly admire these hundreds of brave men.

### Berlin Newspapers Comment on Goering's Speech

Berlin, 5th (Havas)

The newspapers have recently commented on General Goering's speech on air defense yesterday. The "People's Observer" stated that the General's frank description of Germany's economic situation is particularly appreciated by the people. Germany's economic policy is based on resisting the blockade. The greatest danger that the German people may encounter in the future is the enemy cutting off Germany's lifeline for the second time. Our leader, Hitler, with his great talent and strategy, accumulated a large amount of storage in the years before the war, cleared the dangerous areas of Western Europe and Southeast Europe, and concentrated the full force of the German army in the rich areas of the Soviet Union. In short, we are extremely strong in both military and economic terms, and no crisis can threaten our survival in the future.

### German Food Minister Rewards Farmers

Berlin, 5th (Haitong News Agency)

German Food Minister Bach yesterday awarded service medals to 1,500 male and female agricultural workers in the Fuhrer's Chancellery to reward them for their hard work in agricultural production. Award ceremonies were held simultaneously throughout the country. Bach also made the following speech yesterday afternoon: "Since the German army occupied various parts of the Eastern Front, Germany has not been threatened by a lack of fertile land. This may be a first in German history. In the past few years, Germany felt the lack of cultivated land, all of which was caused by the oppression of anti-German countries. Now, Germany has begun to organize the occupied areas of the Eastern Front to engage in cultivation and produce agricultural products, so that Germany will no longer have a shortage of food. German business leaders have now led tens of thousands of agricultural soldiers and are actively working on the Eastern Front.

Berlin, 5th (Haitong News Agency)

Soviet occupation zone farmer Lamp Lou, who serves as a special leader in the German army, was awarded the Warrior's Cross for his military achievements yesterday, recognizing the achievements of German farmers in the Soviet occupation zone.

In addition, three other Germans were awarded medals: one was a worker named Lan, who was awarded for his meritorious service in producing war materials, and the other two were former German representatives to the United States, Thomson, who were rewarded for their work before the United States entered the war.

### Nazi Party Overseas Minister Addresses German Emigrants in Switzerland, Overseas German Emigrants Have United and Will Remain Loyal to Their Motherland Even If Maltreated

Zurich, 5th (Haitong News Agency)

Nazi Party Overseas Minister Brae addressed 15,000 German emigrants in Switzerland, asking all countries to treat German emigrants with respect, saying that for ten years, overseas German emigrants have been united. At present, German emigrants in enemy countries are suffering all kinds of maltreatment, the freedom of German emigrants and their families has been deprived, they have suffered hardships in concentration camps, and their property has also been confiscated. This act of maltreating civilians does not benefit the war and only exposes the enemy's inability to defeat the German army and the armies of its allies on the front lines. The enemy tries to cover up its atrocities by putting forward the slogan of the fifth column. German emigrants who do not criticize their motherland are regarded as the fifth column. Therefore, the Tu Society members who stay overseas are all given to the team because they refuse to abandon their motherland. Brae continued, Germany is celebrating the Autumn Harvest Festival, and the Italian people are also celebrating it at the same time. Germany welcomes overseas German emigrants very much. Although they are far away from their motherland, they also celebrate the motherland's festival, which is a great achievement of the National Socialist movement. The ideal of National Socialism not only unites the people of the whole country, but also unites overseas emigrants across national borders. Germany has never forced German emigrants to participate in the National Socialist movement, but three years after the outbreak of the war, although they have been maltreated, they have never abandoned National Socialism, which shows that their social movement is voluntary. Moreover, since German emigrants reside in foreign countries, Germany cannot force them to do so, so the loyalty of German emigrants to their motherland is even more rare and valuable. For ten years, German emigrants have voluntarily given up the rights of democratic politics and liberalism and believed in National Socialism, which has surprised Germany's enemies. Although enemy countries maltreat German emigrants, German emigrants will never be used by enemy countries to betray their motherland. Brae continued, international relations cannot exist without emigrants residing in foreign countries. Overseas German emigrants abide by the instructions not to interfere in the internal affairs of the country of residence, and the country of residence should treat them with courtesy. The maltreatment of German emigrants in England, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, and the Americas is a major insult to those who advocate preferential treatment for civilian products. The United States has amended the conscription law so that not only bachelors from neutral countries must join the US military, but even enemy emigrants must join the military. This measure violates European justice and is a blatant violation of international law. Switzerland's preferential treatment of German emigrants is deeply appreciated by Germany. The German people firmly believe that Leader Hitler will be able to save Germany from the crisis, so they participate in the National Socialist movement. The German people support the Leader and firmly believe that Germany, under the leadership of Leader Hitler, will surely achieve final victory.

### Soviet Public Opinion Attaches Great Importance to the Opening of the Second Front, Stalin's Written Reply to American Reporters Expresses Deep Hope for Increased Allied Assistance

Moscow, 4th (Havas)

American newspaper correspondents stationed in the Soviet Union recently wrote to Supreme Defense Committee Chairman Stalin, requesting a verbal or written response to the three issues of greatest concern to American public opinion. Stalin recently replied in writing, stating that he was very sorry that he was unable to meet with you in person due to his busy schedule. The following is a brief answer to the questions listed by you: (1) You asked what the Soviet Union's two-party transfer of affection has to do with the second battlefield issue. I would like to reply that the Soviet Union's two-party transfer of affection attaches great importance to this. (2) You asked how the effectiveness of Allied assistance to the Soviet Union can be expanded and whether there is anything that can be improved when expanding assistance. I replied that if the assistance of the Allied countries is compared with the large armies that the Soviet Union used to confront the enemy, then the effectiveness of the Allied assistance is very small. When expanding this assistance, the only key point is that the Allied countries should fully and promptly fulfill their obligations. (3) You asked about the Soviet Union's ability to resist the war. I replied that I believe that the Soviet Union's ability to resist German aggressors is more than enough to conquer Hitler's Germany or other aggressors. Stalin knocked.

Tu King Wang Ri, Haitong News Agency

According to the American news agency, Stalin once told reporters that the Allied assistance to the Soviet Union is far less than the Soviet Union's assistance to the Allied countries by restraining the main force of the German army. Qitadarin continued that the Soviet Union believes that opening a second front is an urgent matter, and the Allied countries must fulfill their obligations to relieve the pressure of the German army on the Soviet Union.

A certain place on the Soviet border, 4th (Havas)

Although British and American capitals have been complaining about President Roosevelt's special envoy Willkie's remarks when he left the Soviet Union, the Soviet Union sees this as a glimmer of hope that friendly assistance will eventually come. The Soviet people generally believe that the British and American countries have not fully understood the setbacks suffered by the Soviet Union, and they hope that Mr. Willkie will convey the truth to his countrymen after personally experiencing it, so that the British and American authorities can understand that the opening of the second battlefield cannot be delayed any longer. The Soviet newspapers all said this, but did not reveal their own opinions, only published the views of Allied politicians and reprinted the criticisms of British and American newspapers. On the outside, they vigorously argued that 90% of the German forces are in the Soviet Union, and recently they have transferred two armored divisions and a large number of air forces from Egypt to reinforce the Eastern Front. Although it is not too late for the British and American countries to fulfill their promises, the opportunity will no longer be available, and it is absolutely necessary to attack the European continent. It is not enough to save the Soviet Union by simply bombing Germany. It only needs to force Germany to transfer thirty or forty divisions from the Eastern Front, and the situation on the Eastern Front can be improved. No matter how great the crisis and sacrifice, the second battlefield must be opened this year, because the crisis and sacrifice will be even greater if it is delayed until next year. Even if the landing fails or loses hundreds of thousands of troops, it should be ignored, because the result will have a major impact on the war situation. In short, the British and American people are deeply dissatisfied with the inaction of their own authorities and believe that it is a matter of national honor. Furthermore, Stalin's remarks to American reporters yesterday about opening a second battlefield have also been unanimously reprinted and broadcast by Soviet newspapers and radio stations.

### Overview of Damage in India's Anti-British Movement, More Than 1,700 Civilians Killed or Injured, Railways and Post Offices Heavily Destroyed

Tokyo, 5th (Allied News Agency)

Compiling recent messages arriving here, Usman, Speaker of the Upper House of the Indian Parliament, reported to the Parliament on September 22 that since conflicts occurred between police and military forces and civilians, the death toll among civilians has reached 721, and more than 1,000 have been injured. The police force has also suffered 43 fatalities and multiple injuries. Furthermore, in the states of Bihar and eastern districts of United Provinces, civilians participating in the anti-British movement dismantled railways, resulting in more than 40 train derailment incidents, causing more than 70 casualties. In addition, the Director of War Transport Administration reported to the Lower House on September 14 that the damage to railways due to the anti-British dispute was worth over 750,000 pounds. According to reports from the Minister of Communications, 550 post offices were attacked, of which 53 were burned down and over 200 suffered significant losses. Incidents of damaging telegraph and telephone lines in various places have emerged one after another. Furthermore, Minister of Internal Affairs Marcus Willow stated in a speech on September 15 that since August 8, the anti-British situation has been expanding daily. The most serious situation is that most of the railways in the eastern districts of Bihar and United Provinces have been unable to operate, resulting in traffic disruption for several days. The connection between Bengal and northern India has also been severed. The connection between Madras and Bengal has been completely severed due to the severe damage to the railways. Based on the above reports, it can be seen that this Indian riot was not accidental. The following are examples to support this: (1) The attacks on transportation agencies in various places occurred simultaneously. (2) The special equipment used was not possible to prepare temporarily. (3) All actions prove that the rioters have technical knowledge. (4) The objects attacked in various places all contain military importance. Furthermore, a government representative of the Indian Parliament reported the statistics of the losses of Indian soldiers in this war: 2,096 were killed in action, 8,521 were injured, 2,938 were captured, and 84,833 were missing.

### Intense Competition Among Britain, America, and Soviet Union to Divide Western Asia Rumor of Secret Agreement Between Britain and America to Divide Spheres of Influence in Western Asia

Tokyo, 5th (Domei News Agency)

Rome Special Dispatch: According to sources in Sofia, a secret agreement has been reached between Britain and the United States to divide Western Asia and delineate spheres of influence. At the same time, the two countries' aggressive competition in Western Asia is also intensifying. As the Axis powers are about to enter Western Asia, the internal contradictions between Britain and the United States have already been exposed. For example, recently, due to the visit of a U.S. special envoy to Iran, Britain immediately dispatched its Resident Minister in Western Asia, Casey, and the Chief of Staff of the British forces in Egypt, Maclay, and several other military advisors to Tehran in order to counter the move. It is said that they intend to incorporate the troops of the Iranian and Iraqi governments into the command of the British army, and it is rumored that negotiations have begun to place Kurdistan under British protection. Upon hearing this news, the United States, under the pretext of organizing gendarmerie in Iran, dispatched Colonel Shakoff and experts Littleman and Ailton to serve as advisors to the Iranian government. At the same time, the Soviet Union is also vigorously carrying out propaganda work. The competition among the three countries is fierce, and its future development is worthy of consideration.

### Spokespersons for Various Governments (1)

In this war, news has become one of the most important weapons. Like the production of other weapons, the release of news is also highly centralized. The government spokesperson is a living representative of this fact. Every word he says is quickly transmitted to all parts of the world within minutes. Today, no one in the world has such consistent and far-reaching repercussions for the words he says every day. Not only do his own country's newspapers publish his remarks, but foreign newspapers also record every word he says and use it as the basis for commenting on the policies adopted by the government.

Today, the capitals of various countries around the world regularly conduct foreign news, so each country has its own government spokesperson. According to his personality, his position in the political world, the power and credibility he enjoys in the government, the government spokesperson is not only a liaison between his own government and the foreign press, but in many cases, he is also an active tool of his own government's offensive or defensive policies. A good spokesperson who is familiar with all the issues is an extremely valuable promoter of national policy and a great help to the foreign press at the same time. In recent years, government spokespersons have occupied the most important position in the intelligence agencies of various countries.

Government spokesperson is not the name of an official position. What it refers to is the duty of a specific person. This person may be a high-ranking official in the government or just a small official like sesame seeds and green beans. However, during a certain period, he has expressed political views on behalf of the government and has worked with the heads of various government departments to use moving words to break the enemy's propaganda. We call him a government spokesperson.

The importance of this position is not the same everywhere. In some countries, such as Britain, the position of government spokesperson is not very important. In some other countries, due to the different propaganda policies adopted and the personality of the spokesperson, the remarks he made at the foreign press conference have been transmitted to all parts of the world. The leader of a powerful country, President Roosevelt, personally acted as the government spokesperson because he attached great importance to hosting press conferences.

### Germany's Spokesperson

German government spokesperson Dr. Paul Schmidt was born into a family of farmers and artisans in central Germany. During his high school years, he had already been involved in the National Socialist Party. He entered the university to study at the psychology faculty. Within a few years, he was already a well-known party spokesperson. Today, he is the youngest spokesperson among the government spokespersons of various countries and almost the youngest minister among the government officials of various countries. He has just passed his thirties. He is indeed a very qualified journalist. In his current work, he can combine the sophistication of a diplomat with his own sharp judgment and understanding of the hopes, difficulties, and needs of correspondents.

No foreign correspondent is willing to miss the press conferences he convenes at the Berlin Foreign Ministry or the Government Building. The atmosphere of the meetings is usually tense. Foreign correspondents listen attentively and ask questions. The spokesperson answers various questions tirelessly because he understands the mission of foreign correspondents. Very important political or military actions are often announced at the press conference for the first time. There is no other place in the world where press conferences are more dramatic and tense than in Berlin. For example, the announcement of the German army's attack on Norway on April 9, 1940, the announcement of the attack on the Netherlands, Belgium, and France on May 10 of the same year, and the announcement of the attack on Yugoslavia and Greece on April 6, 1941, and especially the announcement of the attack on the Soviet Union on June 22, 1941. The tension in the air at the time was unprecedented.

As an example of a dramatic press conference, we still remember that in the months after the Tripartite Pact was signed in Berlin to avoid the United States from entering the war, the attitude of the American newspapers in Berlin, like in the capitals of other Axis countries, did not have any repercussions. Foreign correspondents, therefore, used indirect or direct questions at the press conference to probe the attitude of the German government towards these increasing provocations. The whole world was extremely interested in the attitude of the German government. This was the time for the spokesperson to show his skills. Foreign correspondents, especially American reporters, fired questions like raindrops, and the spokesperson's answers were also as fluent as a stream. Although these answers discussed the issue in great detail, no inappropriate words could be found.

### The Bureau of Public Works Issues a Strict Notice to Thoroughly Implement Light Control. Those Who Violate or Take the Opportunity to Cause Disturbances Will Not Be Protected and Will Be Deported.

After Mr. Du Zheng, the Chief Patrol of the Bureau of Public Works Police Department, returned to Shanghai on the 2nd of this month after completing his official duties in Tokyo, he paid great attention to the air-raid light control that started on the 1st and will continue for ten days. In the past one or two days, he personally inspected various districts in the Public Concession during the evening light control and listened to the work reports of the heads of various police stations. As a result, he believes that some people in the Concession still neglect the orders of the authorities and fail to thoroughly implement light control, which is harmful to public security. In addition to immediately ordering all personnel of the police stations to work hard to supervise the people in their respective jurisdictions to pay attention, if there is no improvement, the exercises will not be suspended. Yesterday, the Bureau of Public Works issued Notice No. 6115, urging all residents in the Concession to strictly abide by the instructions issued by the authorities during the air-raid light control period. Those who refuse to follow the methods announced by the authorities at any time will have their electricity supply cut off for a period of time or will be sued to the主管法院for legal action. Furthermore, anyone who repeatedly violates the light control measures or engages in any behavior that takes the opportunity to disturb the security and order of the Concession will not be protected and will be deported. It is verified that this measure has been implemented in the French Concession by the French Consul-General Majella a few days ago.

Things to Know When Walking During Exercise Time

According to a spokesperson for the Bureau of Public Works, the public's mistake is to walk back and forth on the road with lights in their hands during the exercise. If a real air raid occurs, this situation is fatal. It is also learned that the police departments of the two concessions have stipulated that all public vehicles will be suspended during the light control period. Passengers are only allowed to walk on the sidewalk after getting off the vehicle and are not allowed to linger in the middle of the road because the vehicles are suspended.

New Zhabei Baojia Discusses Improvements

All Baojia heads attended on time. The police authorities gave a speech on the improvement of light control and said that if citizens do not obey the guidance of the Baojia heads and violate the light control advice, the police station will impose the most severe punishment. The committee then encouraged the service personnel, and the meeting ended at 9:00 AM.

Terrorist Exercise

Two foreign nationals disguised as terrorists posed as sending gifts to the No. 1 inquiry post of the Gongping Road Self-Police Team. The outside of the gift was tied with a card from the Gongping Road Chairman. After five minutes, it was inspected and found to be two bombs. They were urgently reported to the宪兵. The Marines and the Bureau of Public Works blocked all traffic at Broadway Road, Tangshan Road, Seward Road, etc. until 8:30 PM before it was lifted.

Evacuation Drill

The Self-Police Team of Yuqingfang, North Sichuan Road, Hongkou, held an evacuation drill at 2:00 PM on the 4th. At that time, it was assumed that several incendiary bombs were dropped near No. 151 of the road, causing a fire in all the houses. After receiving the notification from the messengers, the gas switches were turned off, and the coal, charcoal, and phosphorus fire Kenya were no longer tightly closed to prevent Xiao Xiao's activities. The residents of the area all went to the corner of Changchun Road and Diswei Road to take refuge. It ended after ten minutes.

A Glimpse Along the Way After the Police Were Dismissed

Only the major intersections such as Jiangxi Road, Paoqiuchang, Fujian Road, and Zhejiang Road had large electric lights turned on. The rest of the streets were abnormally dark. Pedestrians were weaving back and forth like shuttles. Various vehicles were following each other. The trams were running as usual. It was late at night and there were few passengers. The shops on both sides of Nanjing Road were still open for business. The self-police teams along the way were busy directing vehicles and pedestrians.

### Reed Pond Paintings

Zhou Huaimin's traditional Chinese paintings are successful, especially several reed pond paintings. Their excellence lies in their vivid energy and simple brushwork.

The phrase "vivid energy" was created by Xie He. Energy can be understood but not explained. Simply put, vivid energy is the highest state of the composition of the picture. We know that the most important thing in a painting is the connection between the parts, the distinction between the main and the secondary. If the former cannot be achieved, there is a lack of unity; if the latter cannot be achieved, the focus is lost. If a woman has clear eyebrows and eyes, well-proportioned limbs, and appropriate manners and speech, everyone will consider her to be graceful. Painting is the same. Zhou has a unique ability in layout and coloring and is also good at figures, so his energy is vivid. Reading his paintings for a long time can make people forget themselves. Self-forgetfulness is the manifestation of the great power of general art. Listening to wonderful music makes people lose control of their emotions, and reading wonderful novels makes people forget to sleep and eat. These are all the same principle.

Chinese landscape painting is divided into the Northern and Southern schools. The Southern school emphasizes bone structure, and the Northern school emphasizes brushwork. Bone structure and brushwork can be simply referred to as brushstrokes or silk threads. Zhou's lines actually have the strengths of both the Northern and Southern schools. The strange peaks and mountains are all like Xia Gui's, and the dense reeds and trees are very similar to Yun Lin's. They are vigorous but slightly charming, and they look very harmonious.

Zhou boasts that he has an invention in landscape painting, namely changing the horizontal dots of the Mi school to vertical dots, reversing the bold style to a delicate style, which is unique. The reporter believes that this point can be discussed. Indeed, the landscape paintings of the Mi brothers are a characteristic of the school, namely the horizontal dots. However, their horizontal dots are drawn with the boneless splashing ink method, which is unmatched by others. It is especially suitable for themes such as sudden rain and snow scenes in Xia. The so-called vertical dots of Zhou are actually not Mi's method at all, and all the families of the Four Wangs have them. This kind of dot method can be used to add some delicacy to blue-green landscape paintings or spring and autumn scenery, but it cannot depict smoke and rain or snow scenes. Xie He's Six Laws said that one should respond to objects and shape them, and also use colors according to their kind, meaning that to achieve the goal of vivid energy, one must consider realism. Just like writing about Huangshan, one must use the axe-cut texture, and writing about the mountains of Jiangnan must use the hemp-fiber texture. If one creates something new for the sake of novelty, it will inevitably lose its authenticity. Vertical dots are an attempt, and Zhou's spirit is commendable, but it cannot be said that it has been successful.

Zhou has traveled in Beijing for more than ten years. This time, he returned south and brought nearly a hundred of his recent works, which are exhibited publicly in the Daxin Painting Hall as the first demonstration for the people of Shanghai. All aspects of the production have been studied considerably, and they are indeed incomparable to the general works of the present time. It is indeed worth going to see and refreshing one's eyes and ears.

### Government Bonds Quiet in the Grey Market

Over-the-counter trading of government bonds has turned upward again, but the popularity continues to be flat, and the market situation has become volatile again. Transactions in and out have not been active, and sellers are selling and buyers are buying, showing a situation of each doing their own thing. The inconsistency of people's minds can be seen from this. For example, when Type C first opened, it was only 2.5 yuan, and then buyers suddenly rose it to over 5 yuan. After entering, sellers supplied more than demand, and it returned to 4 yuan. The final price was 4.3 yuan, with a maximum increase of 1 yuan. Type A increased by 3 yuan to 4.7 yuan. Type B was still inverted at 3.5 yuan, but also increased by 9 jiao. Type D was 1.6 yuan, an increase of 7 jiao. Type E was 2 yuan, an increase of 6 jiao. The turnover was about 1.7 million yuan.

### Yarn Prices Fall Back, Cloth Market Turns Weak

Factory Cloth

Yesterday, the market was unable to rise, and the price of various cloths declined again. Taohua Ms. Lin opened at 253.5 yuan. Because it was heard that yarn prices had fallen back, people's minds turned tired, and it gradually fell. The smallest price was 251 yuan. Then it rose slightly, and the closing price at noon was 251.5 yuan. In the afternoon, there were transactions at 252 yuan, but they were also very few. Since the sales of coarse and fine cloth were quiet, the calling price was also soft. Only 12-pound Dapeng fine cloth, New Wing On single 160 yuan, has been traded. As for other such as Earth fine cloth, 161.5 yuan, Fugui factory single 155 yuan, are still rarely accepted by the main.

Eastern Cloth

The market sentiment turned weak and fell across the board. 12-pound Longtou fine cloth, New Wing On single 168 yuan, fell by 2 yuan per bolt. Bank single Longtou fell from 159.5 yuan to 158.75 yuan. Caiball fine cloth 158 yuan, Flying Fish 156.5 yuan, Yanghe 155 yuan, Trumpet 154 yuan, Five Blessings 153 yuan, all fell by 1 yuan. The decline in the outer Four Gentlemen serge red single was even greater, falling from 7.02 yuan to 6.88 yuan. The noon closing price was 6.9 yuan, a sharp drop of 1.4 jiao compared to last week, while the bank single serge, although it fell, was still stable at 6.75 yuan.

### Supply Less Than Demand, Cigarettes Rise Sharply

Cigarettes British and American goods such as Old Knife and Fairy brands have risen sharply, because the sales and guest demand are prosperous and the rest are firm. Japanese cigarettes are becoming more and more expensive and prices are soaring. The national cigarette market is stable and the prices have not changed much. British Brand is 8,350 yuan, up 100 yuan, Old Knife Brand is 6,900 yuan, Pinhai Brand is 6,600 yuan, Fairy Brand is 5,850 yuan, Wuhua is 5,900 yuan, which is 300 to 400 yuan higher than the weekend. Japanese cigarettes Gold Gun Brand is 2,950 yuan, Gold Building is 3,100 yuan, Red Rose Brand is 2,250 yuan, Quanlu Brand is 3,100 yuan, Nianzhi is 2,700 yuan, Ten Branches Double Axe is 3,100 yuan. National cigarettes Pyramid is 5,200 yuan, Beauty Brand is 4,600 yuan, Gold Mouse Brand is 2,150 yuan, White Gold Dragon is 3,100 yuan, and Golden Dragon is 2,850 yuan. It is still expected that the market may rise further because supply is less than demand.

### Gold Ornaments Market Remains Unchanged

Yesterday, the Shanghai jewelry industry and Daxin peers posted a price of 2,350 yuan per tael of gold ornaments (300 yuan weaker after deduction). The inter-trade price was initially high at 5 yuan, totaling 2,120 yuan, then slightly lowered to 2,110 yuan, and soon rose again. At noon, it was 2,135 yuan, a rise of 20 to 25 yuan compared to Saturday's price. The transaction was sparse. The price of silver ornaments was still 14 yuan per tael, and the inter-trade price was 13.57 yuan.

### Government Red Dates Offer New Products

When the season for new government red dates comes, the government red dates have now arrived with more than 200 packages. The quoted price is relatively high. The company once offered 300 yuan, but the asking price is still tens of yuan short. It is expected that the transaction can only be prosperous after the two parties are close.

### New Southern Zi Prices are High

The new Southern Zi recently arrived from Taigu with 300 to 400 packages, and the quoted price has been opened at 460 yuan. Tianjin has also opened a batch of Tianjin Chenkui Zi with a price of 420 yuan. The market is tight.

### The Lice on Oneself

— Zhihu

Pickpockets in Shanghai are simply a profession outside of the three hundred and sixty professions that requires no capital. There is no road, no public place, and no tram that does not have their handprints. According to some books, they also form gangs and forgot that it is an illegal act. However, Shanghainese, who have never encountered pickpockets or can tell a pickpocket story, are indifferent and do not think about how to remove the lice on themselves. This seems to be a strange thing.

For example, the ticket seller on the tram clearly knows that there are pickpocket gangs mixed in the carriage, but he does not monitor their actions and shout "Be careful with your pockets!" Old Shanghainese really understand that this is a warning that the pickpocket gang is mixed in the carriage. However, some people check their pockets where they hide money because of this warning. This is tantamount to "a silver is buried here," giving the pickpocket gang a chance to start. When they find out afterwards, they will inevitably say a sarcastic remark, "I told you long ago to be careful with your pockets!" They think that the person who was stolen is a hick.

Indeed, sometimes they offend the powerful and are caught on the spot, but at most they will only get two slaps. People would let them go, thinking that since I have no loss, why bother to make a big deal out of it?

Some people even watch the pickpocket gang stealing with an appreciative attitude and then exaggerate afterwards, saying that he was squeezing around there and then went down at what station, saying everything in detail.

The harm of the pickpocket gang may be very small, but with the size of Shanghai, the number of thefts accumulated every day must be a terrible number. To eliminate the pickpocket gang, as long as everyone abandons the attitude of sweeping the snow in front of their own doors, they will have no room to be active. To eliminate pickpockets as a movement is a shame for Shanghainese because the lice on themselves are grown with their own blood.

As for the big problem of the pickpocket gang's livelihood, that is not discussed in this article.

### Foolishness and Wisdom

— Zhang Yueshan

Few things are enough to make smart people happy, but nothing can satisfy fools. This is why there are so many people in the world who are worried. People who think they are the happiest are indeed happy, but people who think they are the smartest are probably the most foolish.

Prejudice is the reason of fools; the wise debate the reason, the fools determine the reason.

The wise hate knowing little; the foolish know a lot.

### Gospel of the Poor and Sick

Dear Editor:

I am writing to inform you that in recent years, prices of all goods have soared, and it is difficult for the poor to make a living. Once they become ill, they cannot get proper treatment. The poor and sick are in a desperate situation, with no way to heaven and no door to hell. The painful situation can be imagined. Recognizing this, our colleagues, including Chinese medicine doctors Xu Zhixian, Shi Shaoji, Hu Zupei, etc., have established a joint clinic at 15 Meinanfang, North Meibaige Road, Jing'an Temple Road, specializing in treating men and women's internal medicine, dampness, typhoid fever, malaria, dysentery, miscellaneous diseases, lung disease conditioning, and also treating measles and smallpox pediatrics. Starting today, free consultations will be provided at the clinic from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM and 2:00 PM to 5:00 PM daily. All poor and sick people will not be charged a penny, but due to economic limitations, the distribution of medicines will be temporarily suspended. If you are introduced by a great philanthropist to seek medical treatment, or if you entrust our clinic to send medicines, we will be sincerely welcome. It is the duty of human beings to help each other. Our colleagues in this clinic use this position to reduce the pain of the poor from diseases. We hope that readers will introduce us at any time and the merit is immeasurable. I would like to wish you all the best.

Sincerely,

Joint Clinic of Chinese Medicine

### The Creed of the Oil King

— Translated by Yang Lin

(1) I believe that the highest value of every person is their freedom in life and the right to pursue happiness.

(2) I believe that every right contains responsibility, opportunity contains obligation, and property contains duty.

(3) I believe that laws are made for people, not people for laws. Government is the servant of the people, not their master.

(4) I believe in the dignity of labor, whether mental or manual. The world does not give people a living, but gives everyone an opportunity to create a living.

(5) I believe that frugality is important for an orderly life. Saving in diet, nutrition, or private affairs is the main condition for a sound financial structure.

(6) I believe that truth is fundamental to lasting social order.

(7) I believe in the sanctity of a promise. Everyone's word should be as good as their contract. Personality is not wealth, power, or position; it has the highest value.

(8) I believe that service is the common responsibility of mankind. Only in pure sacrifice can the waste of selfishness be freed.

(9) I believe that the highest point of satisfaction for everyone is harmony with the will of a supreme being.

(10) I believe that love is the greatest thing in the world. Only it can overcome resentment, and only justice can defeat tyranny.

### Introducing the United Second Clinic of Factories

— Zheng Jiwei

There is now a United Second Clinic of Factories under the Industrial and Social Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council, dedicated to serving factories. The clinic was established on July 1st of this year. The address is at 4200 Robert Road, within the Shanghai West Public Society. All work is supervised by the Industrial and Social Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council and the New Gate Sanitation District. Therefore, although it has not been established for long, the results are remarkable. Currently, thirty-two factories are participating. Factories willing to participate only need to pay a reserve fund for their employees of three yuan per person and a monthly medical expense of two yuan per person. Each person can receive a consultation card. Afterwards, employees can present the card to the clinic for treatment or request a doctor from the clinic to make a house call without paying a consultation fee. As for the cost of medicine, except for valuable medicines charged at cost, ordinary medicines are free. Below are the regulations of the clinic:

(1) Consultation hours are from 9:00 AM to 6:00 PM daily, except on Sundays when the clinic is closed.

(2) When visiting the clinic, you need to bring your consultation card (with your photo attached to the back and stamped with the clinic's seal) and a consultation time record. After the consultation, these documents need to be returned to the factory representative for safekeeping.

(3) No registration fee is required for consultations. Ordinary medicines and expenses for wound dressing and surgery are all waived. However, valuable medicines are calculated at cost and settled at the end of the month.

(4) If there are accidents or emergencies in the factory that cannot be sent to the clinic, please notify the clinic immediately by telephone at 32149 so that personnel can be dispatched for first aid.

In addition to medical consultations as the main task, the clinic also regularly holds lectures, performances, and film screenings at the site to improve the workers' health knowledge. It also sends personnel to visit various factories from time to time to conduct on-site investigations of the factory's sanitation and implement necessary preventive measures. There are many factories and a large number of workers in Shanghai West, and there is an urgent need for such a group to help the employees of various factories solve their disease problems. Because it is newly established, there must be many factories that have not participated because they do not know the existence of this group. Therefore, this article is specially written as an introduction, hoping that all factories that have not participated can join as soon as possible.

### Sharing the Same Boat Through Storms

— He Jiazhi

(10) Flying Peak

Wei Shaoyun had a watch on his hand. He seemed to be waiting for an auspicious hour. When he saw that it was not ten o'clock, he bullied others for not having a watch and said that the clock at Sheng Hushan's house was inaccurate. He secretly moved it forward by half an hour, raised his hand to show it to others. Little Zhuge said, "Okay, it's ten o'clock. Let's stop drinking." He took the whole chicken and a bowl of four-joy meatballs to the kitchen. He would eat them later. He stood up first, and everyone put down their chopsticks and stood up too. He smiled and said, "The rope and black cloth are all prepared, aren't they? Young Master Wei, you wait here. Let's invite you in. Have another farewell cup before entering this room." Wei Shaoyun smiled and said, "I'm already a little drunk, no need to drink anymore." Little Zhuge immediately ordered Sheng Hushan, Niu Pi Amao, and Stealing Oil Rat Ge Liu to enter the room to tie up Bian Cuizhen with a method that was gentle yet firm, and firm yet gentle. Before leaving, he told the others, "Don't come peeking furtively." Everyone felt that Little Zhuge's actions were unlikely to be wrong, and said in unison, "Okay." They watched them enter with cat-like steps.

This south room was separated from the room where Cuizhen was lying by three or four rooms. Wei Shaoyun smiled slightly and said, "I don't know why, but I feel a little heartbeat." A Ying, sitting across from him, also smiled and said, "Brother, don't you remember? When you married the first woman at home, you also told me that you felt a heartbeat. I said you were a good boy. You wanted a wife in the underworld, and you were afraid of your wife on the bed. You were afraid that you would feel sorry for her in your heart, so your heart was beating. Now it's your turn again." Wei Shaoyun patted his chest and said, "That's probably the reason." As he spoke, he heard a cry like a bird. Wei Shaoyun said, "What was that?" Someone next to him said, "It was the sound of the wind." Speaking of the wind, the light of the safety lamp flickered a little. Then, many people's voices inside clamored. Wei Shaoyun's expression changed and said, "What's wrong?" A Ying said, "Listen, the light in the room was probably blown out by the wind. The back window must have been opened by the wind first. I'll send a lighter to them." (195)
