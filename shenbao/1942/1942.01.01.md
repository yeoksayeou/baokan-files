### Philippine Battle Situation: Japanese Attempt to Encircle Manila from North and South

Bangkok, 30th (Kaito News Agency) - General MacArthur's headquarters announced this afternoon that "the battle situation everywhere is quiet."

London, 31st (Havas News Agency, Reuters, Manila) - The U.S. Far East Command Headquarters issued a war report yesterday stating, "Japanese forces are advancing with a large number of tanks and armored vehicles. U.S. forces have been forced to retreat." A large number of U.S. troops have abandoned the defense of ××××. The two Japanese columns advancing on Manila from the south in recent days appear to be planning to converge at ××××× (50 kilometers from Manila). Although the direct distance between ××××× and Manila is only 50 kilometers, there is still a ×××× spanning 25 kilometers in width and 40 kilometers in length in between. Reuters reporters believe that the Japanese army intends to cross the ××× from the southwest to attack ×××××. Furthermore, observing the slight decrease in Japanese air force activity, it is generally believed that the Japanese side seems to want to allow the combat troops to rest slightly and wait for fresh troops and gasoline supplies before launching a new offensive.

Manila, 30th (Havas News Agency) - According to the latest frontline news, the Japanese forces that landed in northern Luzon last week have already reached ×××××××××××××× and ××××. The Japanese army is now preparing to establish contact between its various units in order to continue its advance.

Bangkok, 31st (Kaito News Agency) - According to the latest official reports from Manila, Japanese forces are currently advancing simultaneously from the north and south. Japanese bombers have been able to control all major transportation routes. The Japanese army is advancing with a large number of tanks and armored vehicles. The U.S. defense line is currently retreating. It is also learned that at 10:15 AM today, the sound of artillery fire was heard from the south to Manila, indicating that fierce fighting is taking place there.

Tokyo, 31st (Kaito News Agency) - A spokesman for the Japanese Imperial Headquarters Navy Department stated yesterday that the purpose of the Japanese military operations is "Asia for Asians," which also means "the Philippines for Filipinos." Destroying Manila is not what the Japanese army wants.

Lisbon, 31st (Domei News Agency) - U.S. Far East Commander General MacArthur declared today that the U.S. and Filipino forces should take retaliatory action against the Japanese air raids on Manila. However, this seems to have already been labeled as retaliation and merely expresses his personal hope.

### Churchill's Speech: Future War Trends Can Be Divided into Three Main Stages

Ottawa, 30th (Reuters) - (Chongqing Broadcast - A crowd gathered to welcome Prime Minister Churchill's arrival). A crowd gathered in front of the Canadian Parliament today. The Prime Minister arrived at the Parliament at 6:56 PM, and a thunderous cheer erupted. Canadian Prime Minister King and the Speaker of the House welcomed Churchill at the entrance of the parliament. The venue was packed, with approximately 2,000 people in attendance. Many members of parliament came from thousands of miles away. Churchill delivered a speech amidst applause from the members of parliament.

Ottawa, 30th (Havas News Agency) - British Prime Minister Churchill delivered a speech in the Canadian Federal House of Commons and Senate today, strongly asserting that the future war will generally be divided into three main stages. He said, "The first stage is the effort to unify operations. During this period, the most important thing to pay attention to is arduous combat. We must concentrate all our efforts to gain an advantage in both the sea and air. The main task of the second stage is to adjust efforts. We will see the Allied nations draft a general plan to use all their strength as much as possible for common interests. The third stage can be called the era of freedom. The people of all countries who have been enslaved will regain their freedom, and the conquered territories will be reorganized. The Canadian Federation has made great efforts in the current war. The British people are deeply grateful. The bravery of the Canadian army has been fully demonstrated in the battle of Hong Kong. Their combat record alongside the British army will be comparable to the Vimy Ridge battle in the last war. It must be known that by 1943, Britain will have the best pilots in the world. My purpose in coming to Washington this time to talk with President Roosevelt is to unify the command of the Allied operations. We can never accept any compromise. In short, looking to the future, it is still extremely dark. It is difficult to predict when the war will end at this moment. However, how it will be in the future depends on how hard the Allied nations work and how the war evolves, which is an irrefutable argument.

### Gandhi Resigns as Chairman of the National Congress Due to Disagreement with Other Committee Members on Abandoning Passive Resistance; Rumors Suggest Nehru Will Succeed as Chairman of the National Congress

Bardoli, India, 31st (Havas News Agency) - The Executive Committee of the National Congress met here yesterday. Chairman Gandhi had previously sent a letter to the Congress stating that as long as India's freedom is not achieved, the passive resistance movement (i.e., non-cooperation) that he advocated will not be suspended for a single day. Since this position is contrary to the opinions of most representatives, he has no choice but to resign automatically to make way for a more capable person. After the letter was presented and read out, the Executive Committee immediately passed a resolution approving Gandhi's resignation and supporting the assistance of Britain in the war. The main points are that "Although the current policy adopted by Britain towards India has not changed, this committee believes that the impact of the world situation on India at this moment cannot but be taken into account. Therefore, the Indian National Congress naturally sympathizes with those who are oppressed and those nations that are fighting for freedom. However, one point must still be stated, that only an independent and free India can plan its national defense from a national standpoint and serve the great cause of all democratic countries to overcome the various difficulties of the war period." According to Gandhi's letter to the National Congress, he first stated that when the Congress convened in Bombay on June 16 last year, he was publicly elected as the chairman. He thought at the time that the meaning of this resolution of the Congress was to express its refusal to participate in any war and to oppose all violent actions. Today, he realizes that his interpretation is contrary to the opinions of most representatives of the Congress. However, he has decided to continue to promote the non-cooperation movement, hoping to eventually implement anti-war advocacy and obtain freedom of speech with the support of comrades.

Stockholm, 31st (Kaito News Agency) - According to reports received here yesterday, Gandhi has resigned as the leader of the Indian Parliament. His resignation was the result of a meeting with other key members of the Congressional Party. After Gandhi's resignation, he ordered his followers to withdraw the implementation of his policies of non-war and disobedience. Because after the outbreak of the Pacific War, Gandhi requested the Congressional Party to restore the freedom movement, sources in the communication field stated that Nehru, a well-known anti-British leader, will succeed as the leader of the Indian Congressional Party.

### Public Works Department Considers Registration of Canned Foods; Not Likely to Be Implemented in the Near Future

It is heard that the Public Works Department of the Public Concession is currently considering following the example of the French Concession Public Works Bureau by issuing an order to register all imported canned foods that need to be used for more than one month.

### New Puyutang Appeals for Donations

The Xinzi Yutang in Nanshi is a well-known Catholic charity organization with a long history and complete facilities. It is divided into a nursery, an orphanage, a nursing home, and a disabled home, and houses and educates nearly a thousand orphans, the elderly, and the weak. Now that economic assistance from abroad has been cut off, fixed donations in this city have decreased, and prices have soared, the cost of living is very high. It is impossible to dismiss those who have already been accommodated. As a last resort, an appeal is made to benevolent people in the community, hoping that they will adopt the principle of treating others' children as their own and embracing all people, and make enthusiastic donations, whether in the form of food, clothing, or cash.

Official receipts will be given as proof, and the information will be published on this newspaper's WeChat every two days.

### Impersonating and Extorting: Arrested and Sentenced to Imprisonment

Zhou Zhu, a woman from Dongting Mountain residing at No. 28, Lane 657, Tiantong Road, had a large quantity of lead type materials stored in her home, which was coveted by bandits. At 11:00 a.m. the day before yesterday, four people suddenly came to her, claiming to be from the Japanese Headquarters to investigate. They were local residents Ni Shuifu, Fang Fuqing, Wuxi resident Shen Nengquan, and Chen Bingquan, who is still at large.

Claiming that there were prohibited items stored in her home, Fang and Shen forcibly entered Ms. Zhou's bedroom and searched through boxes and chests without asking for any reason. They also forced her to open the silver dollar box. Ms. Zhou begged them in vain, saying that she had to pay 6,000 yuan to settle the matter, otherwise all the lead type materials would be taken to the headquarters and confiscated. Ms. Zhou had no choice but to invite her neighbor, Yuan Wendan from Ningbo, to her home to mediate.

Feigning Compliance

While reporting the incident by phone to the relevant Huisi Police Station, who dispatched Chinese and Western detectives to arrest them, Chen Bingquan was alert and escaped, while the remaining three people, Ni, Fang, and Shen, were arrested, along with Yuan Wendan from Ningbo (suspected of colluding with them), and taken to the police station. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the court, where the police station's lawyer, Li Zhishan, filed a public prosecution on charges of extortion under Article 3134, Paragraph 3 of the Criminal Code, stating that the defendants took advantage of the situation to extort money from the woman.

Pretending to Extort

Such behavior is abhorrent in this extraordinary period, and asked that they be severely punished. As a result, the court sentenced Shen Longquan to one year and four months in prison, and Ni Shuifu and Fang Fuqing to one year each, as a warning. Yuan Wendan was acquitted.

Detectives were dispatched to his residence in Yidingpan Road, where he was arrested and escorted to the First Special Court, where he was publicly prosecuted on charges of forgery under Article 317 of the Criminal Code. Judge Feng approved the defendant's release on bail pending trial. The case was scheduled to continue yesterday by Judge Feng, but the defendant did not appear. The court adjourned the hearing and notified his bailor to appear.

### Notorious Thief Rearrested After Release from Prison

Tang A'jin, a notorious thief from Chongming, had committed crimes in the Public Concession three times. He was recently released from prison, but he refused to mend his ways. At 1:15 p.m. the day before yesterday, he ganged up with one other person who is still at large and went to the vicinity of Zhaopu Road and Wuchang Road, where they robbed Zhu Guangzi, a beef seller from Danyang, of 50 yuan in legal tender. After the incident, Chinese and Western detectives from the Hongkou Police Station arrested him. The stolen money was taken away by his accomplice. He was taken to the police station and escorted to the court yesterday morning, where the police station's lawyer, Li Zhishan, requested that he be detained. The request was approved for further review at a later date.

### Woman Falls to Her Death

Zhao A'bao, a woman from Pudong residing at No. 25, Lane 17, Xiaodongmen Street, French Concession, who was 23 years old this year, went to the fourth-floor sun deck to collect clothes at 5:00 p.m. on the 28th. She accidentally lost her footing and fell downstairs, injuring her head and abdomen. Her family immediately sent her to the hospital for treatment, but she died due to her serious injuries. Her body was then transported to the Tongren Fuyuanchuntang. Yesterday, her husband, Zhao Heshang, arrived at the scene to collect the body.

### Woman Dies by Suicide

Li Wang, a woman from Anhui, 50 years old, who lived at No. 18, Xiaobangwan Lane, Julai Da Road, swallowed opium in anger at 10:00 a.m. the day before yesterday after arguing with her husband, Li Guoping. Her husband discovered her and immediately sent her to the hospital for treatment, but she died because of the deep poison. Her husband then had her coffined.

### Man Commits Suicide Due to Poverty

Zhou Zhenhong, a man from Chang'an, 29 years old, who lived at No. 5, Dakang Lane, Kangdi Road, committed suicide by drinking medicine in Room 4 of Wuling Apartment at No. 244, Baier Road, late at night the day before yesterday due to economic hardship. The tea boy discovered him and reported it to the police station, who sent him to the hospital. He died despite treatment. His body was then transported to Tongren Fuyuanchuntang, where his younger brother, Zhou Zhenfa, arrived at the scene to collect the body.

### Lawyer Fang Junjie Performs Accounting Services

Lawyer Fang Junjie has been practicing law for over ten years and has gained the trust of people in society.

Lost Women's Watch. I picked up a women's rectangular watch on the No. 9 bus at the Jing'an Temple station at about 2:30 p.m. on the 28th of this month. I immediately handed it over to the conductor of the car, No. 421. It is hoped that the owner will see the report and go to the company to claim it as soon as possible. Sincerely, Zheng Peisheng.

### Foreign Rice Quiet, Domestic Rice Slightly More Replenished

Small ground foreign rice saw quiet trading due to holders' intention to raise prices, leading to both sample showings and transactions being sluggish. However, domestic rice saw more replenishment before the Lunar New Year holiday, with purchases becoming more concentrated. The market also recovered from weakness. In the morning, following the previous day's weakness, the prices of various rice types saw another small decrease of 3-4 yuan. Subsequently, with more demand than supply, market prices immediately rebounded, ultimately not differing much from the previous market. However, there were many secondary retailers, causing a slight suppression. Kunshan Superior Japonica was sold at 220 yuan, Southern Late Rice at 208-204.5 yuan, Early Rice at 205-206 yuan, and Du Jian dropped to 190 yuan. Jintan High White Yuan was priced at 220-218 yuan, which, although nearly 10 yuan lower than the previous price, was still higher than the 210 yuan offered for entry the previous day. Total transactions for various rice types throughout the day exceeded 400 bags, while new arrivals were only over 220 bags. However, peddlers along the way still added some decoration.

Wheat was difficult to approach due to owners insisting on maintaining high prices, with only scattered deliveries to factories. Bran saw inquiries from both inland villages and local households, with the market gradually improving. Although local bran experienced a halt in transportation due to no goods, daily factory and customer bran still arrived to supply. Yesterday, households from Pudong were packing, making the market atmosphere particularly lively. Orchid Bran had already opened from 53.5 yuan to 54 yuan, reaching a maximum of 54.5 yuan. Three Gold Bell Bran officially opened at 56.5 yuan. Total transactions for the day did not fall below 1,500 bags, and prices were again 1 yuan higher than the previous day.

Grain trading was quite sparse yesterday, as peers were not particularly interested in entering and exiting the market due to the end of the year. Therefore, the market was bland and lacked momentum, with little change in prices. The overall market saw 20 barrels of Dalian soybean oil sold at 280 yuan, 200 dan of Dayou Factory Pure Oil at 248 yuan, over 100 bags of Chongming Red Sand at 90-92 yuan, 300 bags of Wuhu Corn at 51-52 yuan, 400 bags of Dutch Yellow Corn at 50.5-51.4 yuan, and 500 bags of Saigon New Corn at 52.5-53 yuan at the West Wharf and 51 yuan at the East Wharf. 500 pieces of Shengji Bean Cake were priced at 18 yuan. Also, the grain market will be closed for three days for the New Year holiday.

### Cash Transactions Still Busy, Prices Have Risen for Five Consecutive Days

Although yesterday was New Year's Eve, the cash cooked red and dark market transactions were very busy. The market remained stable and firm, hovering around the 13,000 yuan mark. A certain party sold a certain number to advance funds, and various parties were optimistic. From the early morning, the price rose by 50 yuan, reaching 12,900 yuan per tael (ten liang). Securities firms and a certain gold shop bought in, and retail investors followed suit, immediately pushing the price above 13,000 yuan, reaching 13,100 yuan. Cash shops and two certain gold shops sold off, and some sold actual goods for cash, causing the price to drop sharply by 600 yuan, falling to 12,500 yuan. After 10:30, it gradually recovered. A certain household and gold shop staff entered, pulling it up by 450 yuan, with the final price at 12,950 yuan at 11:30, fearing it would not be delivered on time. This was 100 yuan higher than the previous day, marking a five-day consecutive rise, totaling 3,450 yuan. Later, it was heard that transactions occurred at 13,000 yuan. There was a 600 yuan difference during the day, with 700-800 taels traded. The exchange price for gold jewelry at major stores such as Daxin remained unchanged at 1,350 yuan per liang (200 yuan discount for buybacks). Sterling silver was nominally listed at 16 yuan, while the black market was 11.5 yuan, 5 jiao lower.

Yesterday's Meal Ticket Market Conditions: US dollar tickets started at 18.2 yuan, then retreated to 17.9 yuan, and finally 18 yuan, with buyers still present. Hong Kong tickets rose to 3 yuan and 5 jiao. Military tickets were 3 yuan, 6 jiao, and 7 fen.

### Cotton Yarn Makes Daily Progress, Japanese Yarn Even Firmer, Cotton Has Been Inquired About

Cotton yarn conditions continue to be good, with increasingly developed buying and selling. This is due to the stable trend of gold, so people's hearts are consolidated. As for the situation of Japanese yarn, it is even more bullish, because sales are not weak. Twenty-count Bianma Factory single opening prices are very stable, and they gradually move forward, breaking out of the 2,000 yuan mark to 2,035 yuan, but after closing, 2,040-2,050 yuan was offered for buying. The spot price of twenty-count Shuangma is 2,120 yuan. The "floor spot" price of twenty-count Tiannv is 2,380 yuan, and the factory price is 2,150 yuan. The twenty-count Shuangdiqiu factory price is 1,800-1,880 yuan, the twenty-count Lanfeng factory price is 2,430-2,450 yuan, the twenty-count Yueqin is 2,220-1,260 yuan, the forty-two count Lanfeng thread price is 3,850-3,950 yuan, sixteen-count Hongkuixing is 1,700-1,750 yuan, the ten-count Hongshuangma factory price is 1,400 yuan, and the ten-count Tongzijun factory price is 1,400 yuan. Currently, the yarn market is making daily progress.

The cotton market is showing increasingly better signs. Factories have begun to inquire, making purchasing possible.

### Cotton Cloth Selling Prices Continue to Rise

Factory Cloth: Yesterday's market continued to be firm, with peers trending upward and actively searching for spot goods, but transactions became scarcer due to holders maintaining high prices. As a result, the selling prices of various cloths rose by 1.5-3 yuan per bolt. Fugui Dapeng fine cloth was 84 yuan, Huadie coarse cloth was 102 yuan, eleven-pound Three Rabbit coarse cloth was 71 yuan, nine-pound Wufu coarse cloth was 61.5 yuan, Shilin cloth was 145 yuan, and blue cloth was around 110 yuan. Over 100 pieces were traded in the local market.

East Cloth: Yesterday, trading was active in the local market, and market prices continued to rise. The factory price for ten-pound Longtou fine cloth closed at noon at 86 yuan, another 1.5 yuan increase from the previous day. Mid-range varieties were particularly popular. Caiqiu Feiyu surged by 3.5 yuan per bolt, trading at 83.5 yuan. Yanghe fine cloth was 83 yuan, Laba was 81 yuan, and Sijunzi Shipu cloth soared to 157.5 yuan, with Xique Shilin at 156 yuan, all with transactions. Sijunzi Serge new orders were 3.05 yuan per yard, and old orders were 2.96 yuan.

### Government Bonds Mostly Closed Out

Government bond off-market trading was on its last day today. There was still a lot of trading. Most transactions were still the closing of transactions by various peers, as the bank's collection and liquidation situation was not relaxed. Therefore, government bond off-market trading was silent after 10:00. Grade A was from 60 yuan to 0.67 yuan. Grade C was 55.23 yuan to 0.78 yuan, Grade B was 56.7 yuan, Grade D was 52.5 yuan, and Grade E was 54.3 yuan. Transactions also amounted to more than 100,000 yuan. There is no formal announcement yet as to whether the red market will open.

Yesterday, outside shares of the Public Industry Association were slightly firmer. Jardine Matheson was bid at 70 yuan, Ewo Cotton Mill at 26-27 yuan, Planting at 21.5-22 yuan, Asia Dock at 8.2 yuan, China Textile at 9 yuan, Paper Industry at 6.12 yuan, and Lange Rubber was only sold when it reached 20 yuan. No other market prices were heard.

### Coal Ball Supply Restored to Original State

Retailers Adding 1 Yuan to Cartage: The coal ball market situation has seen various factories resume production one after another in recent weeks. Wholesale prices are still sold at 374 yuan, with supply and demand equal. It has returned to its original state. However, due to automobile restrictions, peers have stopped delivering goods, causing collapsing vehicles to be highly sought after, with very high prices. Depending on the distance, each ton ranges from 15 to 30 yuan. The cost of delivery to the store has reached over 390 yuan, and after removing the scattered coal dust, some stores add 1 yuan to the cartage per dan, hoping that the factory can understand this situation and appropriately reduce wholesale prices to facilitate sales.

### Cigarettes Sell Well and Smoothly

Cigarettes are scarce and sell smoothly. Trade prices are soaring, with various brands rising by over 100 yuan across the board, trading as follows: Great Britain brand at 3,950-4,000 yuan, Old Knife brand at 3,750 yuan, Pinhai brand at 3,380-3,400 yuan, Wuhua brand at 1,840 yuan, Little Fairy at 1,950 yuan, Golden Rat brand medium box at 1,470 yuan, Beauty brand medium box at 2,020 yuan, fifty-branch Great Three Cannon at 11,420 yuan per 10,000, and the price for a box of 200 Great South bullets is 47 yuan.

Daily necessities such as matches, candles, and soap are in short supply from the factories, with holders holding on tightly, causing prices to be firm across the board, as follows: Phoenix brand matches at 1,510 yuan, Beauty brand at 1,580 yuan, Bai Xiangmao soap at 71 yuan, Huang Xiangmao soap at 57 yuan, Gu Ben soap at 78 yuan, and sailing ship foreign candles at 53 yuan.

### Snake and Horse Conversation

— Xiaoman

Mr. Snake carefully checked the files for his year in office and neatly handed them over to Mr. Horse, who was taking office. Mr. Horse opened it and saw that all prices had risen during the year, and hoarders had tripled their profits. Mr. Snake was also richly rewarded, making him envious. He smiled at Mr. Snake and said, "You really have an eye for opportunity!" Mr. Snake said, "Brother Horse, you are a hotshot in the racetrack, and your speed is not necessarily less than mine." Mr. Horse was initially pleased, but then frowned and said, "This is one thing at one time and another at another. How can I clean up the mess you left at the end of the year? I was born at the wrong time, neither early nor late, but just when this isolated island is most depressed. There are restrictions on all kinds of daily necessities, so where can I make a profit?" Mr. Snake suggested, "There is a lack of gasoline on the island recently, and your horse-drawn carriages should be in demand. Currently, horses are also in short supply, and there is no place to buy them even for a thousand yuan. You might as well manipulate it." Mr. Horse stamped his foot and said, "Don't mention horse-drawn carriages. It's really hateful to mention this matter. Dragging a heavy burden behind me, I can't run fast or jump high. How can I be as successful as you have been this year!" Mr. Snake said, "This can only be blamed on your bad luck. However, after working for a year, I have been criticized a lot, and the people hate me to the bone because I窜 ran too fast, and most people have been left behind. So you can't run fast anymore; if you run like I did, as the saying goes, 'a cornered dog will jump over a wall,' then the consequences will be unimaginable!"

### New Year's Message

— Liao Mu

Today is New Year's Day.

The beginning of a new year, everything is new. Amidst the changing world and the vicissitudes of life, people begin a new chapter in their life history. Let the old pass; greet the new with great joy. History is advancing, never retreating; and people are also moving forward with the times.

I want to congratulate those who stand at the forefront of the times! Where does the joy come from? There is endless joy and happiness. These must be dedicated to the brave who strive for the times, constantly igniting the fire of life, making life infinite. Although there are thorns, stumbling blocks, and pitfalls on the road, hesitation, and wandering, they will eventually do their best to overcome them and head towards the road to happiness.

The universe is infinite, like a drop in the ocean; although life seems finite, it must grow in time, never feeling a single wrinkle on the forehead, but always exuding the spirit of youth between the eyebrows – what Mencius called the spirit of dawn. This aura can purify the heavens and the earth, and make all things thrive. How can human life decay with vegetation?

We want to make everyone great, comparable to the sun and the moon.

The Book of Changes says: "The first is the head of goodness." It also says: "The superior man embodies benevolence, which is sufficient to lead others." On the occasion of the new year, I offer this as a congratulation.

### Begonia

— Qin Shouou

Sixteen Youthful Fire

"It would be best if I could go back and see my father and brother, which might make me feel better." Once, when Yuan Baofan tried to be affectionate with her, she made this request.

But Lao Yuan was not a child after all, so how could he let her go? He knew that once Xiangqi left him, she would go to find Begonia, and that visiting her father and brother was just an excuse.

"Let's discuss it slowly! We'll go together when we have the chance." He answered cleverly.

Xiangqi also knew that there was no hope. She thought that unless Yuan Baofan died a few years earlier than her, in her life, not to mention seeing Qiu Haitang and her daughter again, it would not even be possible to inquire about their whereabouts. And Lao Yuan's body was so strong? It was as if he would never die!

But the encounters that fate had arranged for her were not as painful as she had imagined; after three years and a few months, a sudden and unprecedented upheaval occurred throughout China. Although many old warlords, after being ousted and retiring, habitually fled peacefully into the concessions to become rentiers, Yuan Baofan's luck was particularly low. Several divisions of his troops rebelled in the midst of this coup, and fought his confidant troops near Chengde for three days, sending his own life and Shaowen's life together. (1193)

### New Year's Try Writing

— Dong Zhi

Once New Year's Eve is over, it is another new year. In the blink of an eye, the warm spring is approaching. This is precisely a symbol of encouraging people to create a happy personal future through hard work and self-cultivation. On this New Year's Day of the 31st year, I respectfully offer the four words "Life Self-Cultivation" as a New Year's gift to readers. However, the gifts of life self-cultivation are so numerous that they surpass the department stores that illuminate the eyes of major companies, and "Life Self-Cultivation" is not well-decorated, so it is inevitably overlooked by customers. The author can only offer this sincerity and dedicate a word, seeking the correction of readers.

In today's Shanghai, the cost of living is so high, and all industries feel the decline in general purchasing power, but there are also people who possess huge sums of money; not engaged in production, to make everyone's life able to be stable, the public must be able to assist as much as possible. Therefore, I remembered that Liu Xiang once said: "If there is worry, then there is fear, caution, and respect for things; if there is respect for things, then there must be good deeds; if you receive them, then there is pride and extravagance, and if there is pride and extravagance, then disaster will come." This is a painful warning to people on how to be diligent and thrifty. Confucius said: "Extravagance is not filial, thrift is solid, and it is better to be solid than not filial." I think that those who are in a better situation should also always be mindful.

Trying writing on New Year's Day, I only talk about self-cultivation. Zhuge Liang said: "Quietness to cultivate oneself, thrift to nourish virtue, without indifference there is no way to clarify ambition, without tranquility there is no way to achieve distance." Take this famous saying as the conclusion of this article.
