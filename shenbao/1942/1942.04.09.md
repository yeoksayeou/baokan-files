### Anglo-Indian Negotiations Expected to Near Conclusion; New Proposal to be Presented; Congress Party Discussing Defense Proposals; Britain Has Agreed to Appoint Indian as Defense Minister

New Delhi, 8th (Havas) – Colonel Johnson, U.S. President Roosevelt’s special envoy to India, announced today that the Standing Committee of the Indian National Congress is drafting a proposal that can be accepted by the British side.

New Delhi, 8th (Reuters) – The Standing Committee of the National Congress Party met for three hours this morning. The Chairman of the committee, Acharya Kripalani, said that the party would resume its meeting at 2:30 pm (Indian Standard Time). However, Acharya Kripalani did not answer any other questions regarding the meeting. According to those who attended the meeting, it is not impossible to resolve the Indian issue and have a national government in power. The Standing Committee of the Congress Party is now discussing new defense proposals. It is widely believed that this proposal is generally acceptable to both senior members of the Congress Party and Cripps. It is said that President Roosevelt's personal representative, Johnson, played a prominent role in the discussion of this proposal.

New Delhi, 7th (Havas) – All India National Congress Chairman Acharya Kripalani stated that the Executive Committee met today to discuss the reply to be given to the plan of British envoy to India, Sir Stafford Cripps. After four hours, a consensus was reached. The content of the reply will likely be released tomorrow. In addition, national leader Nehru told reporters that the date of the next meeting between the leaders of the Congress and Sir Stafford Cripps has not yet been decided, because Sir Stafford is scheduled to host reporters this afternoon, so the meeting date has to be postponed by one day. It is generally expected that the Indian National Congress and the Muslim League will separately inform Sir Stafford of the resolutions they have passed.

New Delhi, 7th (Reuters) – It is reported that the Standing Committee of the National Congress has decided to maintain its previous resolution, which is to advise the people not to accept the British government's declaration. It is also reported that the National Congress Standing Committee's resolution of opposition has completely cleared away the hopes raised by the solution jointly drafted by Cripps and US President's representative Johnson. It is widely believed that the committee will maintain its original resolution on Cripps' statement, and the committee's statement will supplement the committee's attitude towards the revised proposal. The supplementary statement will be submitted to Cripps tomorrow morning in the form of a notice received by the National Congress Chairman Acharya Kripalani this morning.

New Delhi, 7th (Reuters) – National Congress Chairman Acharya Kripalani announced tonight that the National Congress has reached a resolution on the letter given to him this morning by special envoy Cripps. The content of the resolution can be directly submitted to the special envoy tomorrow morning. It is reported that the Standing Committee of the National Congress met today for four hours. Chairman Acharya Kripalani issued the above statement after the meeting. Jinnah, chairman of the Muslim League, met with General Wavell this afternoon and held talks with special envoy Cripps.

New Delhi, 8th (Reuters) – After resuming discussions for two hours, Nehru met with President Roosevelt's personal representative, Colonel Johnson, for 30 minutes today. After the meeting, Nehru participated in the Standing Committee meeting again. In addition, the Standing Committee of the All-India Muslim League met this morning. It is widely believed that the chairman of the committee, Jinnah, reported on his talks with Cripps yesterday. The Standing Committee is scheduled to reconvene at 5:30 pm today.

Washington, 7th (Havas) – According to news from New Delhi, India, President Roosevelt will be invited to mediate between Indian leaders and the British government. When the President routinely hosted reporters today, he declined to comment on this news, saying only that he had not received any telegram from Indian National Congress leader Nehru.

Tokyo, 8th (Haitong News Agency) – Japanese government spokesman Mr. Horio pointed out that the British government's instructions to Sir Stafford Cripps to grant the post of Minister of Defense to an Indian is obviously intended to entice the Indian people. He also said that the British and Japanese attitudes towards India are fundamentally different. Japan has no demands or suggestions for India and wishes India to be completely independent.

British Reply Will Revise Contents

New Delhi, 8th (Reuters) – Jinnah, the leader of the Indian Muslim League, announced last night, "I met with British special envoy Sir Stafford Cripps for 45 minutes this afternoon. Cripps immediately handed over the British War Cabinet's reply, the contents of which agreed to revise the previously proposed solution to the Indian problem, and agreed to have an Indian representative take on the post of Indian Minister of Defense. Sir Stafford Cripps and I then immediately went to the General Headquarters to visit General Wavell to discuss this matter. I then stated that I would convene the Standing Committee of the Muslim League on Wednesday to discuss it." As for the attitude of the Indian National Congress Party, the party chairman, Acharya Kripalani, announced last night, "After receiving the letter from Sir Stafford Cripps, it was handed over to the Standing Committee of our party for discussion. After four hours, it was decided to notify Cripps of the resolution of the Standing Committee this morning. The Standing Committee is scheduled to continue its meeting this morning." It is reported that the Standing Committee of the Indian National Congress decided yesterday that it was still dissatisfied with the British reply and intends to adhere to its original position and notify the whole country to reject the new British proposal. In addition, the Executive Committee of the Indian Liberal Party expressed satisfaction with the British proposal, but believes that there are many dangers in allowing any province not to participate in the Indian Federation.

Berlin, 7th (Allied News Agency) – The contents of the second British amendment to India, as decided by the British War Cabinet, are roughly as follows: In order to defend India, an Indian will be appointed as the Indian Minister of Defense, but this is part of the general war plan of the Allied countries. New guarantees are provided for granting dominion status. Indian representatives may attend the British War Cabinet and the Pacific Military Conference.

Muslim League Satisfied With Reply

New Delhi, 7th (Havas) – Jinnah, chairman of the Muslim League, met with British envoy to India, Sir Stafford Cripps, for one hour today. Afterwards, he told reporters that the British Cabinet had accepted the proposal to appoint an Indian leader as Minister of Defense, and therefore the League was satisfied with it. However, according to Reuters, Nehru, the leader of the All-India National Congress, has raised new objections to the British plan, and the subcommittee of the Congress has decided to continue to maintain its opposition attitude. Under the current situation, it is expected that the plan brought by special envoy Cripps will be completely opposed.

Indians in London Assume New Plan

London, 8th (Reuters) – After the Indian National Congress Party rejected the British War Cabinet's revised proposal put forward by Sir Stafford Cripps, Indian people in London today suggested the following conditions, which may constitute a temporary agreement acceptable to the Congress Party. The conditions are as follows: One Indian member shall be placed in the London War Cabinet and the Pacific War Conference in Washington, and an Indian shall be appointed Minister of Defense in New Delhi. General Wavell will remain Commander-in-Chief, implementing partial technical management. The Indian Minister of Defense shall have internal political power. Regarding the future Indian government, the government must have complete freedom and political power, and a governing body must be established in New Delhi, with representatives from various provinces and states of India participating in this body. After at least ten years, the Indians will solve their internal difficulties themselves without external interference, and no state shall be allowed to secede or divide. The Congress Party rejected the British revised proposal on the grounds that it demanded the immediate transfer of all political power, including the absolute management of defense by the Indians. It is widely believed that the British War Cabinet, after holding a long meeting at the end of the week, has authorized Cripps to make the greatest concessions, but with certain reservations, because this issue involves Britain's responsibility to protect India and the general strategy of the Allies. At the same time, the proposal to grant India dominion status still exists.

Indian Federation Must Not Be Divided

Bombay, 7th (Havas) – Savarkar, Chairman of the Indian Mahasabha Party, recently stated that the American people should understand that the Indian people can never accept the proposal to split their country. Our party, in principle, does not oppose compromise, and expresses satisfaction with the British promise of Indian independence and equal negotiations between Britain and India, but firmly opposes division. If Britain maintains its original conditions, it will be rejected.

New Delhi, 7th (Reuters) – Luo Aissa, Chairman of the Indian National Liberal Federation, submitted the committee's opinion to Cripps last Thursday. The committee welcomed the British proposal to allow India to establish an autonomous dominion, but believes that the provision in the proposal that provinces have the right to decide whether to join the new Indian Federation contains significant difficulties and dangers. It is said that if India establishes more than one federation, each with its own independent army, it will inevitably lead to conflicts and the establishment of tariff barriers under certain imaginable circumstances. As for complex issues such as wharves, railways, and highways, they will follow. The British government should consider the above difficulties and dangers. The committee requested to participate in the election of state representatives to the constitutional institution, and believes that the move to establish Indian seats in the British War Cabinet and the Pacific War Conference is still satisfactory, but the British should further appoint Indians as defense commissioners. If so, it will have a significant impact on the Indian people's full participation in the war effort. After the meeting, the committee requested that the Governor-General's Executive Council should be Indianized, so that in the near future, the Governor-General can be the head of the government in accordance with the constitution.

### Casualties Estimated on Both Sides of War

Chongqing, 7th – New York airmail, according to statistics experts of the American Life Insurance Company, the total number of soldiers who died on both sides of the warring countries in 1941 was about 1.25 million to 1.6 million, or even more than this number, almost the same as the situation in the First World War. In the two years from 1939 to 1940, the estimated number of soldiers killed in battle was only 300,000. Last year, 500,000 or even 600,000 Germans died in combat on the Eastern Front. The number of Soviet troops killed in battle must have exceeded 750,000. Within three weeks after Japan launched the Pacific War, tens of thousands of people were killed in battle, while in the last war, it only sacrificed 300 people. The loss of US troops in these three weeks was heavier than the total loss in the last war in 11 years. In the Pearl Harbor battle alone, 2,729 US Navy personnel were killed. This number is more than three times the number of American sailors killed by enemy attacks in the last war. Last year, Britain's losses should not exceed 40,000, while Italy's were between 30,000 and 50,000.

### British Lieutenant General Anderson Appointed Commander of Eastern Military Region

### Official Announcement of Japanese Aircraft Attack by Madras

Some Casualties in Cocanada

Madras, 8th (Reuters) – According to official announcements, the first air raid alarm was issued this morning, but there was no bombing. The alarm was lifted one hour later.

Madras, 7th (Reuters) – The Madras Provincial Government Defense Department announced that Japanese aircraft first attacked ships in the port of Vizagapatam this morning. The first bombing time was 1:30 pm (Indian Standard Time), and the second time was 5:00 pm. The Japanese aircraft dropped about 20 bombs, all of which fell in the dock area, with slight damage and few casualties. The city was not hit. One plane attacked Cocanada at 7:00 am this morning. The plane strafed two small boats in the port, killing and wounding 11 sailors. At 1:45 pm, five planes bombed the gasoline plant equipment on the shore with slight damage, but no casualties. At 4:00 pm, Cocanada issued another alarm, which was lifted 15 minutes later.

Lisbon, 7th (Allied News Agency) – After the Japanese air force bombed Ceylon, Cocanada, and Bungedambu, on the southeast coast of India, the situation of the British troops stationed in various areas has become extremely uneasy. According to a telegram from Madras, the city has started a blackout since last night, and an air raid alarm was issued again this morning, lasting for more than two hours. The 750,000 residents of the city were in a state of chaos, scrambling to take refuge. According to news from Calcutta, the Bengal Provincial Government has announced an emergency notice today, advising all inland waterway ships to withdraw to the upper reaches of the interior, and starting to register various means of transportation such as carriages and automobiles in preparation for requisition.

### Madras

Madras is the capital port of Madras Province, with a population of approximately 750,000. The Governor's Office is located here. Various buildings are rich in artistic meaning and historical value. Its commercial center is the famous George Town. The south coast is called Marlna, and the City Council, Madras University, and Queen Mary Girls' School are all located here. Since the Pacific War entered the Indian Ocean, this city has been threatened after Ceylon. The picture shows the scenery of the south coast of Madras.

### Turkey's Moat

However, the Caucasus region, although it is also a good oil area, is not a good thing. Not to mention artificial buildings, just its naturally rugged and steep appearance is enough to behold. Almost the entire area can be said to be more than 1,200 feet above sea level, and most of it is between 3,000 and 6,000 feet of rocky ridges, with the highest peak reaching 18,000 feet. In addition, important passes are steep on both sides, allowing only one person to walk side by side. It is probably impossible to have a blitzkrieg or a mechanized troop charge in this area.

Moreover, the Soviet Union and Britain have jointly arranged a defense work made of cast iron here. No matter how strong the German army is, it will be difficult to succeed in this area.

Since this area is so difficult, what about the second route, Libya? First, we need to know that the progress in Libya is based on the fact that Italy still has some remnants in North Africa, and on the fact that the Germans spared no expense in building a springboard on Crete, which can be used as a foothold for transporting troops to Libya. With these two points, Libya has become a possible target for the new offensive.

However, taking Libya as the target of the attack, the intention is on the fat meat of Egypt and the Near East. But if we carefully consider the overall situation, we will know that in the eastward offensive, Libya and the Dardanelles are a chain formation, that is to say, attacking Libya alone and leaving the Dardanelles is ultimately useless. So, why don't the Germans advance on both sides at the same time? Perhaps the intention is that after the troops reach Egypt—hypothetically speaking—, they will play a friendly game with Turkey in a doubled threatening posture. Because in the end, it is more worthwhile to open up the road in Turkey without moving a soldier than to fight a desperate battle. Moreover, this small and capable Turkey is so fierce and unruly.

What if the Germans really do this, and Turkey still firmly insists on neutrality? Then, naturally, there is only a reckless path. When it comes to recklessness, we are a little worried about this God of the Nazis.

Please refer to the map. The road to the Near East has three dead passes in a straight line from north to south: The northernmost is the Dardanelles between the Mediterranean Sea and the Black Sea, which has already been mentioned; In the middle is the world-famous Suez Canal, which connects the Mediterranean Sea to the north and the Red Sea to the south. At the southern end is the Bab-el-Mandeb, which is Arabic for "Gate of Tears," which is a haunted gateway between the Red Sea and the Indian Ocean. It is conceivable that the shape of this strait is so evil that one must shed tears of sadness to pass through this "gate of tears" safely. In addition, each pass is protected by corner-style islands or fortresses: the Dardanelles has the Gallipoli fortress and the Imbros Island; Suez has the island of Cyprus and Palestine; "Tears Gate" has the Aden Fortress and the Ankotra Islands.

There are a few sentences in the records of the Three Gorges in China—"In the seven hundred miles of the Three Gorges, the mountains on both sides are connected, and the overlapping rocks and barriers obscure the sky and the sun. Only at noon and midnight can the sun and the moon be seen." This is a small-scale realistic portrayal of the three passes of the Near East. Moreover, to covet the meat of the Near East, all three passes must be broken at the same time. Why? First, these three passes are a one-word long snake formation, echoing each other from beginning to end. It is useless to focus on one end. Second, the land to the east of the three passes is the base camp of Islam, which is a chaotic thing. The British have used all their martial arts and housekeeping skills, both soft and hard, and have played here for many years. They still have to shed tears in the dark from time to time. How can a blitzkrieg be effective for a while? There are at least a few hundred or thousands of novels, notes, and miscellaneous works in English about this kind of thing. It can be said that the Near East problem is no small matter, and it is very difficult to say. Therefore, the easiest way is to climb up to Turkey.

How to climb up to this friendship? Everyone knows that Turkey established the world after Kemal's scorched-earth battle and drove the Greeks out of the country, and then implemented reforms. There is no need for the author to talk too much. But looking at the current situation in Turkey, it is probably difficult to remain neutral to the end. At the same time, judging from the attitude of Turkey's current President Ozturk Ismail, it seems that he does not favor either democracy or Germany. What we are eager to know now is this point—if the Germans want to come hard, how will Turkey respond? Is it willing to be a moat for the democratic front?

### Japanese Army Launches Large-Scale Offensive; Fierce Fighting in Bataan; Japanese Army Continuously Reinforcing and Making Progress

Washington, 8th (Reuters) – According to the Army Department, elite Japanese troops yesterday launched a fierce attack on the defenses of the US-Philippine Allied Forces on the Bataan Peninsula under the cover of tanks, planes, and artillery, and continued to make progress. The Corregidor Island Fortress in Manila Bay was not bombed yesterday, but was only bombarded by coastal artillery.

The US Army Department issued a communique yesterday stating that on the Bataan Peninsula, Japanese troops, under the cover of tanks and artillery, launched a large-scale attack on the US military positions. The Japanese troops were continuously reinforced and made progress. The casualties on both sides were quite heavy. During the fierce battle, Japanese dive bombers also assisted in the air, dropping bombs and strafing with machine guns from time to time. There was no air raid on Corregidor Island. The Japanese artillery in Cavite often bombarded our port facilities. There was nothing worth reporting in other war zones.

Washington, 8th (Reuters) – The US Army Department announced in a communique this morning that on the Bataan Peninsula of Luzon Island (US troops) withdrew to pre-arranged defensive positions last night.

Washington, 7th (Reuters) – The Army Department released an official report with information obtained before 7:00 pm yesterday as follows: On the Philippine side, the Japanese army, with a large number of troops, continued to attack the central part of our military defense line on the Bataan Peninsula under the cover of artillery and tanks.

### Rice Shortage in Hong Kong

Tokyo, 8th (Haitong News Agency) – After returning here, Ishida, the economic advisor to the Governor of Hong Kong, said today about the food situation in Hong Kong that the source of rice in Hong Kong has been greatly reduced, so the problem of unblocking the source must be solved immediately. The distribution of rice in Hong Kong is now controlled by the Japanese authorities. Workers engaged in hard labor can get one pound of rice per person. The Japanese authorities are making every effort to evacuate residents and return them to their hometowns. Since the Japanese army occupied Hong Kong, 500,000 Chinese have left Hong Kong, so the total population of Hong Kong has decreased from 1.7 million to 1.2 million. In the future, Hong Kong needs to import 60,000 tons of rice from Vietnam every year. At present, Japan lacks ships to transport rice, so it is suggested to use large civilian ships to transport rice. The situation of other daily necessities in Hong Kong is good. Sugar can be used for six months, and salt can be used for two years.

Japanese Officer Describes Malayan Campaign

Tokyo, 8th (Haitong News Agency) – Japanese newspapers today published a detailed account of the Malayan campaign by an officer under General Yamashita, commander-in-chief of the Japanese forces in Malaya. He stated that the Japanese General Staff had initially set a 100-day limit to capture Singapore. The victory was due to the Japanese landing at Singora and the establishment of an airfield on the island of Kota Bharu, enabling the Japanese to establish a strong air force base within two weeks. After occupying Johor Bahru, the Japanese army prepared 1,000 rounds of ammunition per cannon, and 600 rounds were used to bombard Singapore from Johor Bahru. Only 400 rounds were used in the Singapore battle, so very little remained after the capture of Singapore city.

### German Aircraft Launch Large-Scale Bombing Raids Over Malta: Valletta and Other Areas Damaged; Four Attacking Aircraft Shot Down

Malta, 8th (Reuters) – Malta issued its 2,000th air raid alert yesterday (Tuesday) and suffered its largest air raid that day. The island's ground defenses immediately opened fire, creating a dense web of fire at high and low altitudes. Although no detailed report has been received, it is known that four Axis aircraft were shot down or destroyed, and two were damaged. The German aircraft attacked first in the morning and then launched a large-scale air raid in the afternoon. The German aircraft included dive bombers, which arrived in batches and attacked the port area and airfield. The attacking German aircraft flew in small groups over the coastline in various places, apparently to feign an attack in one direction to cover the true target of the bombing. Valletta and other areas were damaged, and there were casualties. Last night, Malta issued six alerts because several Axis aircraft arrived separately. British night fighters shot down one bomber. (Note: Malta has only had one day without attacks since December 4th and only nine nights without attacks.)

### Brazilian Merchant Ships to be Armed Soon

Lisbon, 8th (Haitong News Agency) – A report from Rio de Janeiro last night stated that well-informed sources revealed that Brazilian merchant ships sailing in the Western Hemisphere will be armed, sail without lights, and travel in convoys to protect themselves. Officials have remained silent on this news, and it is not yet known when it will be implemented.

Rio de Janeiro, 7th (Havas) – Officials here recently announced that the Brazilian freighter "Cabedelo," with a displacement of 3,557 tons, sailed from a US Atlantic port on the 14th of last month and has since disappeared. It is believed to have been sunk by an enemy submarine. This is the fifth Brazilian ship lost in the last two months. All newspapers have published this news with large headlines. A naval spokesman said that since the Brazilian ship was attacked, the government has taken preventive measures, including arming merchant ships and providing escorts, and has instructed captains to take precautions against submarine attacks and extinguish lights when sailing at night. A representative of the Caciliense Shipping Company stated that there is reason to believe that the "Cabedelo" was sunk at night by a submarine, which did not issue a warning beforehand. However, another Brazilian source stated that it is currently difficult to determine whether the ship was sunk by an Axis submarine or due to another common accident.

### British Newspapers Discuss Spring Offensive: Germany May Attack Suez Canal; Britain is Fully Prepared and It Will Be Difficult to Succeed

Swiss Capital, 1st (Havas) – The Zürcher Zeitung recently published a report from its London correspondent stating that British newspapers are currently discussing whether the German army will extend its spring offensive on the Eastern Front to North Africa. According to British military observers, the Libyan front is currently quiet, but it cannot remain inactive for long. According to reliable sources, German General Rommel has recently transferred two mechanized divisions and a large number of aircraft to Crete, the Dodecanese Islands, and Martuba in Libya, including fighters and bombers, as well as transport and gliders. It is likely that the German army will adopt the same paratrooper strategy that it used in Crete a year ago. In addition, Germany has concentrated a large amount of landing equipment and seaplanes on Rhodes, which is also noteworthy. All of these points indicate that the German government intends to launch a large-scale offensive to attack the Suez Canal or British Malta. As a result, the British Eighth Army is clearly in danger, but British officials believe that no matter what decision Germany makes, Britain is well prepared and it will be difficult for Germany to succeed.

Turin, Italy, 8th (Havas) – Il Popolo d'Italia today carried a special dispatch from the Turkish capital, reviewing the strength of the British Middle East forces. It stated that the British Middle East Commander, General Auchinleck, can mobilize the Eighth Army in Egypt, but this army has actually been absorbed by the Desert Force commanded by General Ritchie for combat on the Libyan front. On the Nile front, General Stone's troops are stationed. Although this army is not very large, it is entirely composed of British soldiers. In addition, the Middle East forces can also mobilize the Ninth Army commanded by General Wilson and the Tenth Army commanded by General Kynaston. The Tenth Army is stationed in Iran and Iraq and numbers no more than 10,000 men. The Ninth Army is about the same size as the Tenth Army and is composed of Greeks, Jews, Czechs, Free French, and Poles. There are no British troops in it. There are plans to train an Arab army to increase strength and to transfer Polish troops from the Soviet Union to reinforce the Middle East. However, the Polish High Command objects to the transfer of Polish troops to Iran, and the Soviet military authorities also believe that the army should remain stationed in the Soviet Union.

### Notes on Ceylon

Ceylon has always been famous for Ceylon tea. Its location is none other than southeast of the Indian peninsula, arguably an isolated island in the Indian Ocean.

The island's climate is very good. The indoor temperature is between eighty and ninety degrees year-round. In winter, one does not know what cold is; in summer, there is no unbearable heat. Most lovely are the many sunny days, with no annoying humidity at all. Ceylon also has a rainy season, which lasts from May, June, and July, to October, November, and December. However, the rain in Ceylon falls very quickly; after a heavy rain, the weather returns to sunshine. There is no incessant rain all day long like the plum rains in Japan.

According to a survey in 1912, the island's population was 4.5 million. Compared to 2.4 million fifty years ago, in 1871, it has almost doubled. Although the exact number of the recent population is unknown, it is probably around six million.

The Sinhalese account for 70 percent of the population. This group is divided into mountain and plain dwellers. The former are more conservative, possess a strong and persevering character, and retain ancient customs in their language and customs. The latter are more progressive, mostly living on the southwest and northwest coasts. Those living on the east coast are now also very inclined to class, and their politics, medicine, and law are becoming westernized. These people are mostly in the fields of knowledge and news, and their number is quite large.

Second to the Sinhalese are the Tamils, who account for 25 percent of Ceylon's total population. This group is mostly divided into Indian and Ceylonese. The latter are mostly wealthy classes and are highly respected in society. The former mostly belong to the poor class, working all day long just to get enough to eat. The people seen in the city of Colombo, such as rickshaw pullers, are mostly of this ethnicity.

In addition, there are the Moors who live in Colombo, Galle, and other places, and the Veddas who are scattered in the eastern part of Uva Province. The Moors are good at weaving rattan objects. The Veddas are good at hunting, living on wild honey and yams. Their fate is somewhat like that of the Ainu in Japan, and their numbers are decreasing day by day.

There are approximately four to five thousand British people in Ceylon, while there are only about fifty Japanese. Before the July 7th Incident, there were about three hundred overseas Chinese, but after the incident, the number increased significantly, and now it is around three thousand.

Ceylon's products are most famous for Ceylon tea; rubber is also produced in large quantities. Ceylon's tea production is about 300 million pounds per year, and the capital is mostly British. The fluctuations in the tea market have been quite intense in recent years, but the Ceylonese only supply tea picking and have nothing to do with it. When tea prices are high, they do not get a share of the profits; when tea prices fall, they do not suffer any losses.

Ceylon tea can only be grown in Ceylon, which is due to the climate and soil. Previously, the Taiwan Governor-General's Office widely planted Ceylon tea seedlings on Taiwan Island. Initially, there was some Ceylon tea flavor, but after two or three years, it completely disappeared.

Ceylon is a British colony, and although it is only separated from India by a body of water, there is no political connection between them. The leader of the island's administration is the governor dispatched by the British government, with executive and administrative departments below. Cabinet members and members of parliament are all Ceylonese natives, which on the surface has a democratic atmosphere.

The entire island is divided into nine administrative regions, named after a certain province. A province is roughly divided into three or four counties, and a county is divided into more than ten villages. This is the general political organization of the island. A characteristic of British rule in Ceylon is that Englishmen are heads of everything. The army is in their hands, and so are the police. Four or five years ago, the Minister of the Interior requested the return of police power, but the British did not allow it. Although he fought for it with a general resignation, the result was in vain.

Most Ceylonese are Buddhists; there are also Muslims and Catholics. Today's Catholics are mostly "official merchants" who entered and exited government offices during the Portuguese and Dutch Ceylon era. They had some relationship with the rulers at the time, and as a result, they converted to Catholicism. There are still many Christians living in the coastal areas.

The level of knowledge of the natives varies. Children from wealthy families mostly study in England and are quite advanced. Generally speaking, half of the population has received ordinary education. The native language is the main language, and English is also very common. Even in the countryside, one can get by anywhere with English.

The natives' feelings towards the British are not much different from those in general colonial territories. As the concept of national self-consciousness becomes more and more widespread, the movement for independence and autonomy is naturally becoming more and more intense, especially in this complex and tense era!

The staple food is rice. The problem is that Ceylon itself does not produce much rice. Fifteen percent can be self-sufficient; 85 percent must rely on imports from other places. Previously, the only source of imports was Yangon, Burma. After the outbreak of the Great War, rice prices became very expensive due to insufficient transportation ships. The government, in order to care for the people's livelihood, set an official price, but this resulted in a major strike by rice merchants, causing chaos. Later, when both sides insisted, the Minister of Commerce was forced to go to Yangon to purchase rice, which slightly resolved the rice panic. However, this was the situation before Yangon fell. Now that Yangon has been lost, the source of rice has been cut off. If this problem is not resolved properly, the rice threat to Ceylon will probably be even more serious than military concerns. This is my personal interpretation, but it may also be the truth. (Original by Mr. Zheng Kouhe, translated by Ru Yuanfan)

### Relevant Departments in This City Consider Restoring Nanyang Trade, Business and Industry Plan to Implement Barter Trade

Currency exchange relations and transportation methods are prerequisites

Trade between this port and Nanyang was quite prosperous after the August 13th Incident. Factories in this port competed to transport and sell their products to Nanyang, making huge profits. Many commercial firms also sent personnel to Nanyang to set up offices or distribution points. Since the outbreak of the Pacific War, shipping between Shanghai and Nanyang has been cut off, and trade has almost completely stopped. At present, the war in Nanyang has come to an end, and the business community in this port is eager for Nanyang trade to be restored as soon as possible, so that Shanghai's industrial products can obtain appropriate sales markets, and the materials from Nanyang that Shanghai needs can also be transported in steadily.

Planning to Implement Barter

Relevant authorities in this port have considered the possibility of restoring Nanyang trade. However, because there are no clear solutions to the currency exchange relations between Shanghai and Nanyang and the transportation and shipping problems, it seems quite difficult to proceed with restoring trade at present. Some business and industry operators in this port, in order to break this deadlock and enable the restoration of Nanyang trade to be realized as soon as possible, have suggested adopting the following method: in order to avoid currency exchange issues between Shanghai and Nanyang, it is planned to implement barter trade, exchanging industrial products from this port for materials from Nanyang.

Planning to Use French Ships for Transportation

As for the shipping issue, it may be possible to use ships from the French Vietnam Steamship Company, and take the lead in restoring trade between Shanghai and Vietnam and Thailand. French ships will operate between Shanghai and Saigon. It is expected that the French Steamship Company will be able to assist in this process. Currently, there is a great shortage of various light industrial products and groceries in Vietnam and other places, and there is great hope for Shanghai's supply. Grain and miscellaneous grains such as rice, coal, and corn, which are accumulated locally, also need to be transported to Shanghai to provide food and fuel for the people. The progress of this matter will have a significant impact on the economy of this port, so all sectors are placing high expectations on it.

### French Concession Conducted a Large-Scale Search Yesterday, French Defense Forces Assisted

In order to consolidate public security within the concession, the French Concession Police Department, in addition to stepping up defenses and sending detectives to key roads to strictly search pedestrians and vehicles at any time, also conducted thorough searches of households and hotels in the concession from 4:00 AM yesterday, thoroughly clearing out terrorists and undesirable residents. At around 4:00 AM yesterday morning, the search started in the Xiaodongmen area, searching each household in the alleys, and then expanded to the Mailan Police District and Gongguan Road, etc., ending only in the evening. During the search, the nearby main roads were guarded by a large team of detectives, and the French Defense Forces were dispatched to assist, so the search work was very thorough.

### Coal Ball Raw Materials, Appeal for Chemical Testing

In the past two months, because various coal ball factories have been unable to obtain the required coal seams for manufacturing, the production volume of available coal balls has also decreased invisibly. However, in order to barely maintain the entire fuel supply in Shanghai and enable residents throughout the city to purchase available coal balls nearby, they have all been purchasing peat from various factories for manufacturing coal balls, causing many residents throughout the city to complain, and they have unanimously appealed to the authorities to send personnel for chemical testing. According to news from the coal ball industry yesterday, various factories are now trying to improve the manufacturing of coal balls in order to take care of the public fuel supply, but they still hope that the authorities will provide thorough assistance in order to stabilize the entire fuel supply in Shanghai for the long term. According to the coal ball industry, the raw materials for ball-making now mostly use willow river and Heling debris, which were not used before, but are now regarded as rare commodities, costing more than 700 yuan per ton, while the yellow coal lumps in the balls are burned ones, also costing more than 400 yuan per ton. Only by constructing them in this way can profits be obtained, but users have suffered quite a bit.

### Those Going to Xiamen to Return to Their Hometowns Should Consider Whether They Can Arrive is Uncertain Jinmen Maru Scheduled to Sail to Xiamen Tomorrow

The Jinmen Maru of the East Asia Marine Transportation Company is scheduled to leave Shanghai for Xiamen tomorrow. The ship has reserved 200 half-price tickets to facilitate the dispersal of fellow Fujianese returning to their hometowns. Since the Fujian Fellow Townsmen Association in Shanghai has been handling registration, more than 280 people have registered with the association. However, for this registration, it is necessary to fill in the current Shanghai address, the original hometown address in Xiamen, as well as name, age, gender, and other items. Among the fellow townsmen who registered to return to Xiamen, only 131 have filled in the original hometown address in Xiamen in detail. More than 20 people temporarily filled in the details clearly yesterday. The remaining more than 100 people who have registered have not filled in the original hometown address in Xiamen in detail. The association believes that after these fellow townsmen arrive in Xiamen, they still need to transfer to other parts of Fujian Province. According to what the association knows, traffic from Xiamen to Xinghua, Quanzhou, and Fuzhou is mostly blocked, and whether they can reach their destinations is uncertain. Therefore, these fellow townsmen should consider their return journey.

### Chairman of the Cake and Steamed Bun Association, Manned Flour, Detected by Western Detective Zhou Shihai Has Been Detained for Investigation

The Shanghai Municipal Council previously issued a notice to various bakeries and noodle shops, ordering them to register with the association to collect the information, and then register with the council, so that flour could be allocated fairly. However, Zhou Shihai, the chairman of the association, from Jiangbei, took advantage of the opportunity to register those who had not requested registration by borrowing their names, and apply to the council. The flour allocated to these falsely registered cake and noodle shops was all embezzled by Zhou and sold at high prices, gaining huge illegal profits. Recently, this secret was detected by Western Detective Jones and Chinese Detective Zhu Wanjun of the Central Police Station, who arrested Zhou and put him in custody. They are currently investigating the falsely registered store names and the amount of flour embezzled. Once the investigation is complete, they will be strictly dealt with according to the law.

### Jai Alai Court Robbery, Seems to Have an Inside Connection

The robbery at the Jai Alai court on Avenue Albert on the night of the 7th was briefly reported in the previous issue. It is now learned that the total amount of cash robbed exceeded 25,000 yuan. Both robbers were armed, and it seemed that there was collusion from the inside, so they acted quickly, breaking into the accounting room of the Jai Alai court office, snatching the huge sum of money, and immediately escaping. At that time, Paulve, the director of the Central Sports Association, which operated the court, and six Chinese people were all in the room. Terrified by the robbers' power, they did not dare to resist. They called the police after the fact, but the robbers were long gone. It is heard that the money robbed was the day's earnings of the Jai Alai court, and was to be sent to the bank the next morning after being counted in the accounting room. The French Police Department received a report after the incident and immediately went to investigate, not finishing until late at night. Judging from the case, it is deeply believed that there must be an insider familiar with the daily procedures of the office who colluded with the robbers to commit the robbery. The two robbers broke into the court when the customers had already left and the doors had just been locked. It is heard that the French Police Department has obtained several clues, such as the large iron lock being pried open.

### Sub-Lessees Should Report and Claim Licenses as Soon as Possible

After the Land Office's Revenue Section in Building 506 of the Shanghai Municipal Council resumed office on the 7th after the holiday, in order to alleviate the crowded state of sub-lessees claiming licenses, two windows at the Bicycle License Office opposite the Revenue Section were opened to issue house sublease licenses. The number of licenses issued yesterday is still being calculated. The total number issued the day before yesterday was 1,662, including 618 in the Central District, 609 in the Western District, 269 in the Northern District, and 166 in the Eastern District. The issuance of these licenses will end no later than the end of this month, so sub-lessees should claim them as soon as possible to avoid punishment.

### The Shanghai Municipal Council Strictly Prohibits Receiving Tips for Renting Houses, Those Who Violate the Regulations Will Be Punished

According to a public notice from the Shanghai Municipal Council's Information Office, in order to crack down on tips for renting houses, the Council previously drafted Article 55 of the new appendix to the Land Regulations, submitted it to the Consular Body for approval, and promulgated it as Notice No. 5755. The new appendix stipulates that "any individual, partnership, company, or its agent, who is the owner, landlord, lessee, sub-lessor, or agent of any kind of any house, residence, shop, office, warehouse, or rooms therein, shall not solicit or receive tips before leasing or subletting all or part of the house, and shall not solicit or receive prices exceeding the normal market value when transferring farm tools and decorations. Those who violate the provisions of the above new appendix will be punished by the Council." The public is hereby notified, and citizens are asked to pay attention.

### Two Rice Merchants Have Been Detained and Punished for Selling Adulterated Tribute Rice

On November 8th of last year, the Detai Rice Store at 302 Binlang Road was found to have adulterated the foreign rice sold by the Shanghai Municipal Council with Saigon rice and sold it at a high price. Detective Zhang Wenjun and investigator Jia Di of the Putuo Road Police Station discovered this, and when they went to investigate, the store manager Zhang Lida and others were on the run. They requested an arrest warrant, and only the shareholder Cai Jinsheng from Pudong and the manager Zhang Lida were arrested the day before yesterday. After interrogation and trial, Zhang Lida was sentenced for fraud and fined 800 yuan, and Cai Jinsheng was fined 500 yuan for allowing fraud.

### Flour Supplied to Cake and Steamed Bun Industry Has Been Reduced by 40%

Flour supply to the bread industry remains normal

According to a reporter from the Datong News Agency, the Shanghai Municipal Council's Grain Office designated the Taikoo Wharf on the Bund in the French Concession to collect foreign rice the day before yesterday, and yesterday designated the Fuxin Wharf at 5-10 West Suzhou Road and the Zhengda Wharf at 34-35 West Suzhou Road and the Taikoo Wharf on the Bund in the French Concession to collect foreign rice. The rice from the above wharves can all be shipped out today for sale on Saturday.

Corn Shipped Out

The Shanghai Municipal Council's Grain Office issued a transportation order on the morning of the 6th of this month (Monday) for all 395 rice shops in the two concessions to collect corn from Lihe Wharf at 195 Suzhou Road. All of it was shipped out yesterday. The allocated amount is the same as the previous times, but the lines of people buying corn in front of the rice shops are getting more crowded every day.

Flour Allocation

According to a reporter from the Datong News Agency who inquired with the Flour Office, the flour currently being allocated by the office is designated to be collected from the Huasheng Wharf on Gongping Road. However, the flour at the wharf has now been shipped to the Taikoo Wharf, so flour product merchants only need to collect it from the Taikoo Wharf nearby for convenience. The daily allocated amount is about 4,000 to 6,000 bags.

Reduced Supply Amount

However, the number of registered flour users with the Flour Office has reached 4,000, so the allocation has to be adjusted and reduced. Except for the supply to bread manufacturers, which remains unchanged, the flour supplied to noodle, cake, and steamed bun product merchants has been reduced by 40% compared to usual. The allocation is set to be once every ten days, and the office will issue a flour allocation card to each household, and the amount allocated each time will be recorded on the card.

### Qiwu Society Donates Wedding Gifts from the Sheng Family to Help Students

### Refugee Shelter Renamed Relief Home

The refugees sheltered in the various shelters of the Cilian Disaster Relief Association in this port were completely ended by the end of March, and the names of the various shelters were cancelled. More than 1,000 refugees, including the remaining elderly, weak, disabled, orphans, and widows who could not be sent away, have been continued to be maintained and supplied by the association and the Shanghai Municipal Council, and have been concentrated in the Ciyuan Shelter on North Zhejiang Road for management.

### Clothing Industry Wages Signed a New Agreement Yesterday, Men's Robe 22 Yuan Each, Qipao 18 Yuan Each

Due to the increasing expenses in the clothing industry recently, and because workers are struggling to make a living amidst the soaring prices of goods, they have been preparing to ask the employers to be considerate of their difficulties and increase their treatment. A labor-management agreement was signed yesterday, and the prices for customers' tailoring were slightly increased. The main points of the agreement are as follows: The tailoring prices are as follows: Men's single robe 22 yuan each, lined robe 24 yuan, lined camel hair robe 27 yuan, cotton robe 29 yuan, women's single qipao 18 yuan each, lined qipao 20 yuan, lined camel hair qipao 23 yuan, cotton qipao 25 yuan.

The monthly wages of monthly workers will be increased by 40% across the board. Other items will be handled in accordance with the old agreement. The above conditions are agreed by both labor and management and will be implemented immediately.

### The Old Bookstores' Business is Booming: Original Edition Books Soar in Price, Formerly Valued by Weight, Now Paper is as Expensive as Gold, Series and Rare Books Sell for Staggering Prices

Although the publishing industry in Shanghai has enjoyed considerable profits during this abnormal wartime boom, it cannot compare with other foreign goods industries, and is even less than one-tenth of the paper merchants' gains. Recently, due to the printing of textbooks, it has suffered inspections, business has plummeted, and huge losses have been incurred, making it difficult to recover its vitality. However, the old bookstores' business remains thriving and impressive.

Comparing Past and Present

At the beginning of the August 13th Incident, books were considered worthless, whether woodblock or letterpress printed, valued by weight, ranging from a few cents to one or two dimes per pound. Their cheapness was unparalleled. Later, prices gradually increased, and now, the situation has reversed. Old books have also become like other "daily necessities," with prices rising daily. Even thin, trivial chapbooks of only a few pages must sell for more than one yuan. The expensiveness of books can be described as reaching its peak. Therefore, those who initially set up bookstalls with a capital of over ten yuan have already made considerable profits.

Bookstore Groups

Most bookstores are located between Hankou Road and Fuzhou Road in the Public Concession. Those that started as bookstalls and became bookstores after the war are in the area of Carter Road, Avenue Haig, and Avenue Joffre. New bookstores also opened on Seymour Road after the war. Old bookstore owners are divided into groups from Suzhou, Yangzhou, Hangzhou-Shaoxing, as well as Beijing and Fujian. After the war, some locals who lost their jobs also switched to the old book business. Usually, each group searches for books according to the areas they are familiar with. For example, the Yangzhou group mostly collects goods from the Nanjing-Shanghai Railway area, while the Beijing group transports goods from the north to Shanghai. Among them, those with larger capital also have branches in various places, such as Beijing, Suzhou, Nanjing, or Hangzhou, with Shanghai as the center.

Buying Low, Selling High

Old bookstores search for books, leaving no stone unturned even in remote and dilapidated areas. As soon as they hear of books for sale somewhere, they rush to buy them. During the war, many old family collections were scattered. Many Shanghai booksellers sent people to collect them. Recently, to save trouble and for convenience, some directly purchase from fellow dealers in various places. Scholars who sell old books receive less than one yuan from the bookstores for books purchased for ten yuan. The money earned by booksellers is entirely from the low cost of procurement. Moreover, they may find Song, Yuan, or Ming editions among broken books, like discovering a treasure trove. Broken books were originally worthless, but once they are repaired, bound, and fitted by booksellers, they suddenly become antique and become fine copies. Many scholarly families in Jiangsu and Zhejiang have dispersed after the catastrophe, and their collections are concentrated in Shanghai's old bookstores.

Strong Financial Resources The old bookstores between Hankou Road and Fuzhou Road have abundant capital and many books, so they are favored by book lovers. For example, the Hanwenyuan and Laiqing Pavilion are very prosperous. Although the China Bookstore is hidden on Rue Chia-ching, it is also well-known. However, recently the number of books has decreased rather than increased, and the owner has also changed. Among the Yangzhou group, there are those who hold rare goods for high prices, but there are also those who sell at very reasonable prices.

General Book Prices

Collecting old books is a hobby of intellectuals. If they can buy the books they want, it is like obtaining a secret treasure or finding a confidant. Booksellers can understand the customer's psychology and cater to their preferences. For example, if someone is researching diamonds, they will show them books about diamonds, and they will always get a good price. Before the war, old letterpress-printed books were worthless, far cheaper than woodblock-printed books. Today, woodblock-printed books are not very expensive, except for gazetteers and rare books, at most two or three times the original price, while letterpress-printed books have soared. For example, books from the Academia Sinica and the Palace Museum Architectural Society have doubled in price. For example, Wang Jingru's "Studies on Xixia" in three volumes, published by the Academia Sinica, costs as much as two hundred yuan, while the original price was only nine yuan. This is because specialized books have increased in price even more. The prices of reference books such as indexes and dictionaries have also risen sharply. The Kaiming "Thirteen Classics Index" recently sells for about sixty yuan, and the Zhonghua "C-Type Dictionary" is the same. Large sets of books, such as the Kaiming "Twenty-Five Histories" in newspaper format, cost over four hundred yuan, while the Bible in bible paper costs thousands of yuan and is still difficult to buy. The prices of books from the Commercial Press and Zhonghua Book Company are staggering. Although poor scholars cannot afford to buy them, there are still wealthy people who buy them.

Sales of Gazetteers

Gazetteers have become rare goods, and there is no fixed price. This is because gazetteers are not only reference books and local histories, but also because people are looking for them. Woodblock-printed books and art books published by the Palace Museum have all become antiques, and their prices are exorbitant, beyond the reach of ordinary people. Even the old calendars from the Palace Museum cost five or six yuan each. This is because art books were originally very expensive to produce, few were printed, and there have been no new publications since the war.

### Buying and Selling Short

— Hughes

Shanghai—This "adventurer's paradise" has both the extremely rich and the extremely poor. Some transform from poverty to wealth, while others go from wealth to poverty. The difference between rich and poor is often determined by treacherous and deceitful adventures. As the saying goes, everyone knows magic tricks, but each has their own skill. Speculative adventurers can become rich overnight in a split second, or they can lose everything in that same split second. This is a bloodless way of killing.

Indeed, Shanghai is full of money, so Shanghai society is full of these fraudulent and adventurous behaviors. It is rare to see someone succeed and become wealthy through legitimate business. However, it is common to become rich quickly by taking advantage of the abnormal economic society. Unemployed vagrants from Europe, empty-handed, wandering to Shanghai, often become wealthy in a few years. At least half of Shanghai's citizens are mixed up in the so-called market, using their limited surplus capital, cautiously, to test this adventurous speculation. At the same time, there are many speculative "firms" that lure people to "get rich." The entire city is a speculative world. The psychology of speculative adventure, dreaming of becoming rich overnight, has penetrated the hearts of urban residents.

In the past two years, Shanghai's speculative trading has truly reached its golden age. At that time, the most fashionable trades were US dollar notes, public bonds, and cotton yarn. Within these two years, countless people became rich overnight, and countless people became impoverished, throwing themselves into the Huangpu River, swept away by the river water. Even more people were shot to death out of jealousy for their instant wealth. Evil arises from money, and money is the root of all evil. I really don't know how many tragicomedies have occurred in the past two years. This is the inevitable consequence of speculative trading.

Since the "January 28th Incident," the environment has changed, and great changes have also taken place in finance. The speculative market has temporarily stalled, but before long, it has all stirred up again. Many "firms" have emerged one after another, and speculative methods have also changed their appearance. US dollar notes and public bonds are no longer warmly welcomed. Factory orders and military bonds have become the main speculative trades. Moreover, with the division of legal tender into new and old, currency has become a tool for trading and speculation. The greatness of Shanghai is truly full of wonders. In reality, it has reached the declining period of speculation, and its survival is only temporary. Wealthy people dare not and need not take risks anymore. Ordinary people with very little surplus capital, trying speculative trading with the mentality of "playing mahjong," will obviously not last long.

Recently, newly opened speculative small firms have used "small-amount transactions" to attract the general public to "get rich." "Spring is bright, and market prices fluctuate greatly, now is the time for all circles to make a fortune"; "Loyal service, outstanding reputation"; "The location is particularly spacious, the layout is more magnificent than others"; "Low commission, special treatment"; "Earning money is easy"; "Small-amount transactions, factory orders starting from one package, military bonds starting from one hundred, quotations are reported, and transactions can be completed immediately"; "Same-day margin of one hundred yuan"; plus "Expert guidance, accurate market information, light capital and easy money"; "Instant account opening," plus gifts such as Ireland toothpaste, West Lake towels, rotating toothbrushes, financial collections, etc. These gifts currently cost two or three yuan each, "Old and new friends, come and join us."

Housewives at home lament that prices are too expensive and life is difficult, but after entering the speculative market, they fear that the world will not be in chaos, and prices do not seem to be expensive enough. Shuangma has risen to a new high price of 3,700 yuan, and people still expect it to rise. Bulls are unwilling to sell. I really don't know what kind of mentality this is.

After the division of legal tender into new and old, and the abolition of equal value, small money changers have more opportunities to exploit the common people. A banknote will be discounted after each transfer. After many transfers, this banknote will no longer be yours. Currently, there are also unemployed apprentices from money changers engaging in open-air trading, holding various banknotes, wandering in front of small money changers on Sichuan Road and Jiangxi Road. When they see customers buying and selling currency at the money changers, they go up to solicit business. They buy at a low price elsewhere and sell at a higher price, seeking to profit from it in order to maintain their livelihoods. There are indeed many people engaged in this kind of "open-air trading" banknote business now. There is another type of person who uses a small amount of surplus capital to "open an instant account" at a small firm. Although they do not want to "get rich," they want to earn a little every day for expenses. I don't know if this plan will work out. I once heard a "broker" say, "If you spend 10,000 yuan and sit at home, using the telephone to trade, you can live comfortably every year." These words came from the mouth of an "expert." I think there must be people who sit next to the telephone, making money and enjoying happiness without leaving their homes! Earning money is so easy, yet so difficult!

There is also a type of merchant who hoards goods, holding a warehouse receipt in their hand, sitting comfortably in a sofa chair, watching prices rise. In fact, they have no goods in hand, just a piece of paper. This paper only states what goods and how much quantity there are. How these goods and quantities are, they may not know at all. It is beautifully named "spot goods." The so-called "doing business" is just a warehouse receipt being transferred around.

Buying and selling short, Shanghai is truly a paradise for speculators!

### The Maturity Period for Pledged Goods in Pawnshops is Still Twelve Months

Increasing Warehouse Charges and Shortening the Pledge Period Refers to the Mortgage Lending Industry, Not Regular Shops

According to an investigation by a Datong News Agency reporter, the pawnshop industry in this city is similar to the banking industry in that large firms are pawnshops and small firms are mortgage lenders. In the past, the pledge period was set at eighteen full months. Before the war, prices plummeted, and the loss of goods at maturity was not small. Only then did the industry request that the pledge period be shortened to twelve months. After several appeals, it was finally approved. Therefore, the pledge period now followed by the industry is still twelve full months until maturity, and a five-day grace period is given after maturity to allow the pledgers to redeem their goods.

The Interest is Still Only Three Percent Per Month

All mortgage lenders charge interest on a monthly basis. In recent years, it has been increased several times to a monthly interest of three percent. When pledging goods, a storage fee of three cents per yuan is charged separately. However, the difference between monthly interest and storage fees is that the former is calculated monthly, while the latter is only charged once. However, storage fees have increased considerably over the years with the increase in the cost of living, compared to the past. However, compared with the interest rates of mortgage lenders, it is still far behind.

Increasing Interest and Reducing the Period Refers to Mortgage Lenders

The interest rate for mortgage lenders is charged on a per-period basis for a loan of five yuan or less. Ten days is considered a period, at three cents per period. In other words, the monthly interest rate is already nine percent. However, for amounts over five yuan, the interest is also charged on a monthly basis. The pledge period has always been only eight months. This is still for formal mortgages. The lower ones are even only three or four months, or even four or five months. It is now learned that mortgage lending, starting in April of this year, has eliminated period interest and changed to monthly interest, but the pledge period has been shortened to six full months until maturity. However, mortgage shops in this city are distributed in the concessions and the northern and southern districts, as well as in Pudong, and the quality is also uneven. Whether they can comply with the regulations remains to be seen.

### The Wall Collapsed, Due to the Sale of Low-Priced Rice, Bricks Hit Five People on the Head

At a rice shop on Shanxi Road, Tianjin Road, in the Public Concession, at around 2:30 PM yesterday, when they were selling low-priced rice, due to the excessive number of people and extreme crowding, the wall collapsed. Five people who were selling low-priced rice on the spot were hit on the head by wall bricks, and blood flowed down. The injured were Li Ruihua, Chen Hesheng, Chen Zhixiang, Pan Siqing, and Hu Zhisong. They were escorted to Renji Hospital by Chinese police officer No. 669 for treatment. Fortunately, the injuries were minor, and they were discharged soon after bandaging.

### China Fisheries Bank Develops Business in Fishing Areas

The China Fisheries Bank in this city was initiated and organized by Huang Zhenshi, a major fisheries tycoon in Shanghai. Its main business is to support fishermen's production, regulate fisheries finance, and promote the prosperity of fishing areas. The preparations have long been completed. Since it moved into its headquarters at the intersection of Jiujiang Road and Henan Road on the 28th of last month, and officially announced its opening, business has been extremely prosperous. The amount of deposits has exceeded 17 million yuan. It is reported that the bank is currently planning to develop business in fishing areas, and will gradually implement this plan in Ningbo, Shenjiamen, Daishan, and other areas. The planning is thorough, which will be a smooth road for the fisheries industry in the future. It is also reported that the business conditions of the bank's Xiaodongmen branch are also extremely prosperous.

### Why It's So Hard to Be Sick

— Yu Gang

Among the various difficulties in life now, people are also complaining about "the difficulty of being sick," which is indeed a fact. I am a doctor, and I want to reveal the inside story of why it's so hard to be sick, but I will not be biased.

The first opponent of the patient is often the doctor. The high medical expenses they pay naturally go to the doctor. Therefore, patients believe that the expensiveness of medical expenses is entirely the doctor's undue profit, and that the "difficulty of being sick" for the patient's family is caused by the doctor's actions. In fact, there are other reasons behind this, which are right in front of our eyes, but without being pointed out, everyone cannot say why.

Currently, it is often difficult for doctors to purchase the medicines they need for treating illnesses from pharmaceutical factories and pharmacies. Sometimes they have to rely on personal connections to get the medicine. Therefore, they feel that they cannot fulfill their duties and use their intelligence. However, are pharmaceutical factories and pharmacies keeping the medicines for their own use? That is not the case. They sell the medicines at high prices, and they all end up in the hands of hoarders who have no medical knowledge. These hoarders treat these large quantities of medicines as chips in a gambling game, winning and losing repeatedly, and thus the price becomes higher and higher. When it gets to the doctor's hands, how can they get the medicines? Patients only know that expensive medicines come from the doctor's hands, so the doctor is wronged and cannot clear their name, and becomes a source of resentment.

After this inside story is revealed, people can suddenly understand. Patients certainly have no way to do anything, but what can doctors do? To be frank, what doctors rely on are consultation fees and surgery fees, which are their legitimate rewards. Currently, the legitimate rewards of formal doctors have not increased dramatically. What has increased dramatically is the extra profit of another kind of person.

### Two Cases of Counterfeiting Carbon Paper Have Been Solved

The price of carbon paper produced by Gallaher & Speck, located at No. 131 Yuanmingyuan Road, has soared recently due to a shortage of raw materials. Each box has risen to over 200 yuan. Some profit-seeking people have disregarded the law and counterfeited the trademark to sell for profit on the market. Gallaher & Speck learned about this and reported it to the Central Police Station, which ordered detectives to arrest several criminals at the Pacific Library on Weihaiwei Road and other places, and they have already been punished. Now, Chinese Detective Sergeant Tang Zihong and Detective Cheng Renkun have arrested Qin Jing, a Wuxi native, at No. 335 ShanhaiGuan Road, and seized 50 boxes of counterfeit carbon paper. They were taken to the police station and sent for interrogation yesterday morning. Gallaher & Speck hired lawyer Hu Rong to file a civil suit as well. As a result, Tai Jing was sentenced to five months' imprisonment for intending to deceive others and counterfeiting registered trademarks, which can be commuted to a fine at the rate of two yuan per day, and the counterfeit goods were confiscated.

### Fukang Stock Company Purchases Yinxiang Port Racecourse Stocks

Because the Far East Public Sports Ground Yinxiang Port Racecourse is located in a restricted area, and there are rumors that nearby land may be requisitioned, people from all walks of life feel doubtful about whether the racecourse can resume racing recently. However, it has recently been heard that the stocks of the racecourse are currently being purchased by Fukang Stock Company on the third floor of the Fisheries Bank on Second Ma Road at 20% of their face value, which is also good news for those who hold the stocks.

Yesterday, this newspaper was published at 6:30 PM

### The Food-Snatching Crowd

— Ma Shaobo

In Shanghai, where rice is as expensive as pearls and laurel, "this food-snatching crowd is commonly seen on every street."

They are not afraid of physical violence, of being arrested by officials, and even less concerned. Under the principle of "better to break the law than starve to death," they carry out their work—food-snatching.

They sometimes stroll alone on the road, sometimes gather in groups of three or five, lingering on the streets, watching every pedestrian's food with predatory eyes, waiting for the opportunity to commit their crimes.

Their only weapon is dirtiness. When they snatch food, their first action is not to run away, but to immediately put the food into their mouths. Even if the owner catches them, besides scolding them a few times or even hitting them a few times, they can only sigh at the lost food and admit their bad luck. Sometimes they also use some tricks to achieve their common goal. If you don't believe it, look at the following fact.

On a day on the sidewalk near the intersection of Rue Chia-ching and Nanjing Road, a small peanut vendor was selling peanuts when a customer came to buy them. Suddenly, a pair of dirty hands reached in from the side, and without asking why, grabbed a handful of peanuts, turned around, and walked away, eating and escaping, but not running fast. The vendor was strong and vigorous. How could he restrain himself when he encountered such a scene? So, without thinking, he grabbed a shoulder pole and chased after him. It was ridiculous that the thief in front knew he was being chased, but he did not run fast, still eating and walking. After twenty or thirty steps, he had already caught up. The vendor was filled with anger, raised his shoulder pole, and hit the thief on the head. With a "thump," the thief finally ran away in pain. The vendor also seemed to have vented some of the anger in his heart and returned angrily. But when he came back, he shouted, "Oh dear!" It turned out that while he was chasing, the thief's accomplices had already swept away all the remaining peanuts. Only then did he realize that he had fallen into a trap of luring the enemy deep and diverting the tiger from the mountain. At that time, the passersby only paid attention to their chase and fell for the tactic of shifting their attention.

Food-snatching crimes are so rampant in busy places? In secluded places, they are of course even more unscrupulous, which has a considerable impact on social order.

With the cost of living continuing to rise, food-snatching crimes will inevitably become more prevalent. The indifference of public officials and the lack of concern of passersby are also enough to fuel the arrogance of food-snatching crimes. It is hoped that the authorities will find a way to correct them in order to maintain peace and tranquility.

### Shipbuilding Notes

(II)

Metal plates less than an inch thick, and I-shaped beams, are transported into one end of the factory and out the other. They have become part of a ship, sized appropriately to be carried by a flatbed truck. At full production, the factory can ship 400 tons of such finished materials daily.

Here you can see the ship's ribs being made, each bar taken from the furnace, shining brightly, too bright to look at directly. After removal, they are bent into the appropriate shape on the metal floor. The workers doing this use long-handled, crescent-shaped bars to overcome the resistance of the molten metal, until it is bent into the shape that was planned on the drawings months ago. This requires the combined efforts of many people to succeed, and even with mechanical assistance, it still requires a lot of manual labor, which is a special characteristic of shipyards.

Metal plates are cut according to the blueprints with electric torches, some procedures are very complicated and very precise. They must be handled carefully with a spraying flame. Finally, the metal plates become various different shapes, marked with paint so that people can immediately know which part of the ship they should be installed on.

After the parts have been cut and marked, those used for the ship's bottom and for making fuel tanks, oil tanks, and water tanks are sent to the appropriate place to be riveted and joined. The pipe sections are already tightly attached inside, so when each part is placed on the ship's bottom in order, they can be jointly riveted.

At the exit of the factory, there is a huge rotary cutter. After the metal plates that form the ship's hull pass through it, they can be bent into the required shape. Some oddly shaped parts—such as a kind on the stern—must be heated before being bent into shape. After shaping, they are all carried away by trucks, some towering into the sky, weighing several tons.

Behind the road, these structural materials are piled up like mountains, the wood is stacked high, and the warehouses are filled with various pieces of equipment. Huge cranes move back and forth on the rails, the tracks as dense as a spider web, becoming a spectacle in the shipyard. There it is as if several bridge frames are erected, each perpendicular to the other, each carrying a crane with many chains and hooks hanging from it.

Each ship is like a very long hole, surrounded by scaffolding. You can climb the ladder and step onto the water tank on the bottom of a growing ship. There is a narrow gap, about four feet wide, that will eventually be sealed tightly. Many people are working in the water tank below, some hammering rivets, some welding pipes. The heat is scorching, the voices are loud, and you have to shout to be heard. The ship's... rise high, making the air... so the heat cannot escape. (... spraying flames, workers tell you not to look directly at them, while hammering rivets into the black hole, making a huge roar.

They want to tell you that grasping a heavy riveting machine is a skill to be learned. It's not an easy thing, and it requires strength. It is a skill that takes months to learn. These people are all working with concentration, and they may not even look up when you pass by, as if they don't see you.

Here you can see the steel bars prepared to be bent into ribs connected to the steel plates on the outside of the ship. You can see the magic of steel bulkheads with half-size gaps being closed with electric torches. The huge vents are in place, and the fuel pipes made in the main factory are also in their designated positions, as if they were made on the spot.

Outside, the boiler engine is ready to be placed in the appropriate position before it is placed on the deck. If you look at it in the morning and then look at it again in the evening, you will see that the ship has "grown" significantly. But this is not magic. It is done by workers gritting their teeth, sweating, and bending over on the tight boards that almost burn through their shoes, using hands and feet and iron bars.

When the ship is launched, it is handed over to the fitters, who install special equipment. On a certain day and at a certain time, the tables, chairs, and utensils in the captain's cabin will be taken out of the warehouse, transported to the ship, and arranged by a carpenter. This equipment is the same for all ships.

The rest of the places are decorated in the same way. Bed frames are nailed to the deck and bulkheads. Tables, chairs, sheets, rugs, towels, and knives, forks, and spoons are all placed on the ship. The radio is set up by electricians, antennas are erected, compasses are placed and tested. The national flag is hidden in the... The nautical charts and sextants are placed in the chartroom, and the last box of oil is placed in the engine room, and the ship can sail through the waves, traveling back and forth on the sea.

The actual construction of ships is one of the most complex engineering projects in all of industry. A ship is not only a skyscraper (the America has ten decks), a first-class hotel, a warehouse, or a floating fortress, but also a huge refrigerator, a hydroelectric plant, and a steam locomotive. It must be strong enough to withstand the impact of waves, divided into many watertight compartments to prevent collisions or torpedo attacks, but it must also be light and agile so that it can move quickly in the water.

In the past decade, shipbuilding has made great progress due to the wider application of welding. All the panel frames must be joined, and the replacement of rivets with welding is an important contribution. Some shipbuilders even call it a "revolutionary" advance. Some ships are even "completely welded", such as the "completely welded" oil tanker pioneered by a large shipyard. Now only about 200 rivets are used, which is a huge difference compared to the more than 1.3 million that were required before the advent of welding.

### Speculative Red Chips

High Head Discount Rate: The black market for cash red chips is fluctuating. The rise has slightly fallen back because the silver houses that had been secretly absorbing them for several days suddenly started selling. This was because military tickets rebounded, causing people's hearts to become uncertain. Transactions started as early as 9:30 AM, with the price at 18,700 yuan. Securities firms were buying on behalf of wealthy individuals. Although the silver houses were supplying without hesitation, they also followed the military tickets to 18,950 yuan, and there was once a shortage of supply. After 10:15 AM, the military tickets fell back, and the silver houses devalued to sell off. When it was seen that the price had fallen back, it retreated to 18,700 yuan at noon, and there were no buyers. This was a small decrease of 300 yuan compared to the previous day, and the transaction volume was still small. The price of silver jewelry was 2,000 yuan per tael at both large and new silver houses (purchases were reduced by 200 yuan). Fine silver was 18 yuan, and black market silver was 13 yuan without any interested parties. Silver coins were around 7.5 yuan, and there was still a lack of interest.

The interest rate of the Money Industry Association remained at 7%, unchanged. The head discount rate was 33-34 yuan in cash in the morning, and then it fell back to around 20 yuan, which was 5 yuan higher than the previous day.

It is heard that starting yesterday, the purchase of Central Reserve Bank notes by fellow traders is limited to 20,000 yuan, so the discount rate has also slightly increased to 3 to 3.2 cents.

### Strong Demand for US Dollars, 30 Yuan to Leave the Country

The foreign currency market situation, British and American gold pounds remain unchanged. The former is still 420 yuan, and the latter is still 430 yuan. US dollar notes surged to 31-32 yuan. Hong Kong notes are still 3 yuan and 5 jiao, with large notes reduced by 1 jiao. Military tickets once rose to 7 yuan and 8 jiao, and finally settled at 7 yuan, 5 jiao, and 5 fen.

### Public Debt Actively Covering Shorts, Falling Trend Checked

The over-the-counter market for public debt has seen a checked downtrend as of yesterday and the situation has improved. Though the number of sellers remained quite high, short covering has gradually increased, causing prices to fluctuate, though ups and downs were inconsistent. Most of the ones that dropped sharply the day before saw yesterday's market rally slightly, while the ones trending stronger the day before fell back slightly yesterday. Despite the fluctuating state, current goods still flowed out. The news of the liquidation of Tongyi Co. is said to have created complex relationships causing general unease and volatility, so it is perhaps difficult for prices to rise. Yesterday, Hongxing and Tongkang were experiencing substantial sell-offs, relieved only by short-covering from Yitai and Hongda, although the shorts still continued to sell. Others like Xinhua, Dazhong, Hengyu, and Runde, also sold off, while Runli, Gongmao, Dechang, Renchang, and Baolong bought in, causing the market prices to vary. Overall, the highs and lows varied by 2 and 4 jiao, with a transaction volume of approximately 400,000 yuan. The following is a brief summary table:

Category | Highest | Lowest | Closing | Change from Previous Day
------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | --------
Unified A | 69.00 | 68.80 | 69.00 | Down 0.20

Yongxiang Printing rose to 22.5 yuan, World 53 yuan, Zhonghua 115 yuan, Commercial Press 195 yuan, Great China Match 131.5 yuan, Guanshengyuan 160 yuan, China Underwear (New) 22.25 yuan, (Old) 23.5 yuan, Wing On Company 45 yuan, Sincere 74.5 yuan, Star Perfumery 187.5 yuan, China & Foreign Dispensary 200 yuan, Sino-French (New) 53 yuan, New Asia (New) 33 yuan.

### Lack of Fundamentals, Only Cash is Expensive

Cotton Yarn Spot Market Situation: Continued advances were made, due to a lack of inventory. As for 10-count coarse yarn, because the period of need is approaching, and there are few manufacturers, and foreign merchants' purchase prices are too far apart from 20-count yarn, more and more are being dragged in for comparison. As a result, buying interest is even stronger, and for a time there were insufficient chips to allocate, so the market gradually rose. In this regard, 10-count coarse yarn has hopes of reaching 4,000 yuan. 20 count Shuangma opened at 3,630 yuan, soon rising to 3,680 yuan, then profit-takers sold, easing to 3,615 yuan, but with good spot conditions, it rose again to 3,680 yuan, and closed slightly flat at 3,640 yuan. 42-count Blue Phoenix 9,300 yuan to 9,500 yuan, 20-count Blue Phoenix 5,540 yuan, 20-count Yue Ling 4,950 yuan, 20-count Shui Yue 5,150 yuan, 16-count Red Kui Xing 4,900 yuan, 16-count Golden Bridge 4,720 yuan to 4,900 yuan, 16-count Dabao 4,880 yuan, 20-count Shuangma spot 4,500 yuan to 4,590 yuan, 20-count West 4,660 yuan, 18-count Weaver Girl 4,630 yuan to 4,750 yuan, 10-count Red Shuangma 3,300 yuan to 3,630 yuan, 10-count Boy Scout 3,330 yuan to 3,530 yuan, 10-count Golden Bridge 3,500 yuan, 10-count Red Baoyi 3,410 yuan to 500 yuan, 6-count Rouge Tiger 4,500 yuan.

### Central China Cotton Exhibition

The Central China Cotton Improvement Association, in view of the importance of cotton production improvement, and in order to raise awareness among all sectors, has specifically scheduled the Central China Cotton Exhibition at the Shanghai Youth Hall on North Sichuan Road, Yokohama Bridge in Shanghai from April 10th, 11th, 12th and 13th.

### Though Money Tight, Eastern Cloth Still Strong

Factory Cloth: The market yesterday was steady, without much honor or disgrace. 16-pound Huadie coarse cloth was quoted at 230 yuan, but was not sold. 16-pound Earth coarse cloth was traded at 198 yuan. 12-pound Earth fine cloth 183 yuan, Dapeng 180 yuan, Fugui 176 yuan, Chick Selvedge 282 yuan, Zefa rose by 2 yuan, Changshou Fuzong 6.3 yuan, Huamulan bleached cloth 185 yuan.

Eastern Cloth: Began to rise and was weak, and ultimately was squeezed up again. It fell at the opening due to tight money, but the industry and outsiders expected it to go high, and the pulling force was still strong, so Longtou fine cloth opened the morning with the new single at 231 yuan, dropped to 227.5 yuan, and rose back to 229 yuan at noon. In the early afternoon, it fluctuated around 229 yuan, and then rose to 231 yuan. The late close was 230 yuan and 8 jiao, the old warehouse single was 206 yuan, and the spot was only 194 yuan. Caiqiu fine cloth 209 yuan, Flying Fish 208.5 yuan, Yanghe 208 yuan, Trumpet 206.5 yuan, fine twill was very strong, Wufu Shuangyu opened at 190 yuan, Baby 185 yuan, and the closing price of the four gentlemen's serge orders from October to December rose to 7 yuan and 5 fen, and the red single new tax was 6 yuan and 9 jiao.

### Du Mi's Hoarding is in Full Swing

The suburban porters of Guomi are unusually scarce, and quotations have been rising day by day, differing by ten or so yuan. Moreover, there is no formal market, making manipulation and hoarding even easier. Those who are suffering are still those who need to eat, those who cannot buy rice. Yesterday, there were rumors that early and late rice had increased to 405-6 yuan in the French Concession, and had reached 422-3 yuan in the British Concession, and that thick japonica rice was particularly rare, and some were said to be selling for 445-50 yuan. Given this situation, although there is still a market without transactions, it does not seem to be accurate. However, hearing such high prices is undoubtedly chilling.

### Scattered Transactions of Miscellaneous Grains

Yesterday's miscellaneous grain market was still unusually deserted, because the guild authorities still have no instructions, so traders still find it difficult to engage in transactions, and only a few scattered transactions are done. The market situation is dim and lifeless, and only 100 bags of Chongming Shachi were traded in the unified market, at a price of 200 yuan to 205 yuan, and 30 bags of Sha at a price of 140 yuan, one car of Mingguang red grain at a price of 134 yuan, and 100 bags of Wuhu corn at a price of 142 yuan.

The out-of-market selling price of bran continues to soften, and Sanxin bran has lowered its price by another 2 yuan, to 110 yuan.

### Hoarding Cigarettes, Soap, and Candles, Difficult for Both Buying and Selling, The Tight-Fitting Curse Ultimately Causes a Headache

The selling price of cigarettes is difficult to boost. Money remains tight, and cargo owners are seeking to sell, but cash is required. Most purchases are done with head discounts, and actual sales are sluggish, so prices continue to be weak. Great Britain brands are priced at 11,100 yuan per carton, Old Knife brands 9,700 yuan, Pinhai brands 6,900 yuan, Little Fairy brands 6,000 yuan, and Wuhua brands 5,900 yuan, with slight increases and decreases compared to the previous day. Japanese cigarettes have the most severe declines, with Golden Gun brands 3,050 yuan, Quanlu brands 3,300 yuan, Golden Building brands 3,100 yuan, Red Rose brands 2,100 yuan, and Guide brands 2,360 yuan (selling price of 25,000 sticks), all down by 100 yuan to 200 yuan compared to the previous day.

The selling trend of the daily necessities market continues to be weak. The restrictions on transportation and movement of merchants in the four villages, cargo owners seeking to sell and buyers both find it difficult, so the trading is quite slow, and the market price is really difficult to improve. Phoenix brand matches are selling for 6,400 yuan per carton, Beautiful brand 6,600 yuan, miscellaneous brands 5,500 yuan, Guben soap 335 yuan, Bai Xiangmao soap 300 yuan, Huang Xiangmao soap 285 yuan, Arrow Knife soap 285 yuan, Bai Lishi foreign candles 190 yuan, Kuaima brand 185 yuan, and the selling prices of all goods are consistently declining.

New cigarette shops are still opening one after another, with mostly large investments, but because cigarette prices are too expensive, and the road is also declining, and so many new shops are opening, it is because everything is easily obtained, and money is recklessly spent. What the future holds is like those who hoard daily necessities, already feeling the headache of the tight-fitting curse, which is not easy to remove. It will not be easy to take off this headband until they return from a journey to the West to obtain scriptures.

### White Lotus Inventory Vanishing

Because of the long-term lack of arrivals, the market inventory of white lotus is vanishing. The checking lines only have a little cargo in hand, and there is slight insect damage. The market was called at 800 yuan yesterday, but the customer's taste was not very good, and the counteroffer was outrageous, so no transaction was made.

### Coix Seed Tightens

Because of the long-term lack of arrivals, the market inventory of coix seed is extremely scarce, so market prices have repeatedly increased. Yesterday, the opening line called the market up another 50 yuan.

### Fish Maw Soaring

Fish maw is one of the treasures of seafood. Recently, cargo prices are high, and it is also soaring. Yesterday, the market price of long glue was 3,000 yuan, yellow fish maw 2,500 yuan, Guang maw 4,000 yuan, moon maw 3,000 yuan, lotus bag maw 700 yuan, and the market situation was firm.

### Invincible Tooth Powder Sells Flat at Limited Price

...Each pack actually sells for 2 jiao 5 fen...

The market price of Invincible tooth powder has turned flat, because the factory believes that the black market has risen too much, and retail purchases require 4 or 5 jiao per pack, so the current goods are directly distributed to the cigarette and paper shops according to the factory price, and each pack is sold at a limited price of 2 jiao 5 fen, so the hoarders are feeling timid, and the market price has turned flat.

### Longan (II)

— Gao Jiannong

"The shape is round like a bullet, the core is like a bowl of a stone fruit but not strong, the flesh. White and pulpy, its sweetness like honey, a cluster of fifty or sixty grains, forming a spike like a grape. The longan ripens immediately after the lychee, so it is called the 'lychee slave,' meaning it always follows behind it...." Modern botanists have supplemented this by saying: The longan belongs to the sapindaceae lychee genus of plants, and is an evergreen tree, whose trunk can grow to two or three zhang or even four or five zhang. The leaves are pinnately compound, with small leaves without tips. In the spring and summer, it blooms a fine white flower, the corolla has five petals, and the sepals are arranged in a tile-like pattern: there are more stamens than petals, and one pistil. It bears fruit in July and August, which is round, with a greenish-yellow shell, patterned like scales, and covered with bristles on the outside. The longan pulp that we usually eat is actually a false seed coat; when fresh, it is white and pulpy, and the taste is sweet: after drying, it naturally becomes that yellowish-brown thing that we often see in the southern goods stores. Longan bears fruit very abundantly, and a branch often has a string of twenty or thirty or fifty or sixty grains, so the foregoing says that it is "formed like a grape on a spike."

Nowadays, none of the southern goods stores that sell longan do not hold up "Xinghua Longan" as a sign. In fact, the cradle of longan is in various places in Guangnan, as mentioned before, and can also be seen in the Chronicle of Emperor He of the Later Han Dynasty: "In the past, the South China Sea presented longan and lychee, with a post every ten li, and a mound every five li, rushing through dangers, and those who died continued on the road. ... The emperor then issued an edict saying: "...and ordered the Taiguan not to receive the tribute again"...." Later, Emperor Wen of Wei also had an edict saying: "Among the precious and exotic fruits of the South, there are longan and lychee, and they are now offered as tribute, originating from Jiuzhen Jiaozhi." When Zuo Si of the Pu Dynasty wrote the Rhapsody on the Three Capitals, he also mentioned the "dragon eyes standing beside, and lychees growing laterally" in Shu. Fan Chengda of the Song Dynasty said even more in his Chronicle of the Foreign Lands of Guihai: "Longan is found in all of Nanzhou, and the largest is produced in Fuzhou, round like two coins, but the pulp is thin and cannot go far, making it regrettable."

### The Guopu People of Yunnan

— Xu Ge

According to Mr. Hess, in his article "The Guopu People of Western Yunnan," the Guopu people, called Gangyi in their language, live in large numbers in the mountainous areas of Xundian and Luquan. Judging from the vocabulary they usually use, they seem to belong to the Yi people. The Guopu people live in the mountains, which are not easily accessible to ordinary people, and they still live a primitive life. Most of them own land, growing maize, buckwheat, oats, and wheat. In addition, they also raise many sheep. Because the mountainous terrain is high and not suitable for growing rice.

The Guopu people can speak their own native language and Chinese, but most women only speak the native language and do not understand Chinese. Their bodies seem to be relatively small, but they do not bind their feet, are very active, and very lively. In terms of knowledge, the Guopu people are inevitably making slow progress. Although the level of morality cannot be compared with that of more advanced nations, there are known to be no crimes such as murder and theft in their area, so there is no need for any police at all.

The clothes worn by both men and women are made of hemp, and the production of hemp is considerable. Men wear shorts, long gowns, and coats; women's clothing looks roughly the same as that of the Han people, with broad-sleeved tops and embroidered outer jackets, with long skirts swaying and covering their knees. Married women have tassels hanging from the edges of their skirts to distinguish them. Women like to wear silver earrings, one in each ear, or in both ears. The earrings are not woven intricately, but are very large. Some are as large as an inch and a half in diameter.

In terms of religion, the Guopu people worship nature, and they believe that trees, stones, and everything else are the abode of gods. They also hold sacrifices for their ancestors, weaving a basket-shaped thing out of bamboo, placing it on the wall, and regarding it as the "statue" of their ancestors. Each year, when they perform sacrifices, they slaughter a chicken as food for the gods.

The Guopu people bury their dead in the earth. Some say that they also use cremation, but no one has ever seen it with their own eyes.

When young people reach the age of marriage, they are still unwilling to separate from their old families, so it is not uncommon to see large families with as many as twenty-five men, women, and children.

They have a fairly good temperament and also like to receive guests: when they encounter festivals and banquets, they drink to add to the fun. They are also very experienced in hunting.

### Society

What is most relevant to maintaining the welfare of a society is in fact deep discussion, not elections.

Society often kills those who seek truth, because it fears them. It certainly treats adapting to new facts as a great inconvenience. Lindsay

### Rare at Ninety-Nine

— Wang Xuan

The U.S. Secretary of Labor, Ms. Perkins, shared an amusing anecdote, saying, "My family has always been skeptical of statistics. My great-grandfather lived to be 104 years old, but he was quite stubborn. At the age of 99, he had a major argument with a shoemaker about how a pair of shoes should be made."

"The shoemaker finally lost his patience and said, 'Mr. Perkins, why are you fussing over a pair of shoes like this? You are already 99 years old. Do you really think you'll live long enough to wear them out?'"

"Upon hearing this, my great-grandfather looked solemnly at the shoemaker and said, 'Don't you know that very few people die after the age of 99? There are statistics to prove it!'"

### Kite

— Lei Kaiqian

Child, where are you rushing off to in such a hurry? Wouldn't it be better to sit indoors with me, quietly reading some books, or carefully writing a few pages? Why must you always stay outside all day? See how your mother always says you suddenly become a wild child when she returns from the countryside.

Didn't you say before that there was nothing fun outside? But now you seem so infatuated with the outside world. What exactly is it about the outside that attracts you? Come, let me take your hand and have you lead me to the place you long for...

Oh, it turns out to be people flying kites that captivates you. Ah, unexpectedly, it's this season of spring again.

Actually, it's no wonder you spend your days gazing upwards with such fascination. Look at the kites floating in the clear sky, their carefree and contented appearance is so moving and truly enviable. You say you also want to fly in the blue sky like a kite, to see the vast and distant scenery. I think that's great, at least it will allow you to breathe some air that is free of dust.

But, unfortunately, the child standing next to us who is flying a kite suddenly grips the ball of string in his hand and refuses to let it go, causing the kite soaring in the sky to suddenly stop in mid-air, unable to ascend any further.

What follows is an even more unfortunate encounter. Look at that child, he is pulling the string down bit by bit, bringing the kite flying in the clear sky back to our dusty city step by step. In the end, it finally falls into the hands of that wicked child!...

Now, child, let's go home. Why are you shedding tears for no reason? Did my words hurt your feelings? Is it because you haven't had a kite of your own? Alas, it's all my fault. I've been so selfishly absorbed in my work at my desk all day that I forgot about the joy you deserve.

Then wait, I will write a few more words for you and buy a kite. And we will quickly fly it very, very high, until we have completely let out all of our string. Then, we will both let go of our hands, and let it happily and freely float far away.

### Artificial Rain

— Shi Dong

During the last Great War, many people testified that the continuous shelling of cannons could indeed cause heavy rain. It turns out that after the weather is disturbed, the magnetic field in the air falls into a state of chaos, and then heavy rain pours down. This is not a new theory, but it has aroused great interest because we would have immense economic benefits if we could control the weather. Aren't fruits, vegetables, and grains often harvested poorly due to too much or too little rain?

However, despite this fact, the experiments in the United States and New Zealand using artillery fire to induce rain have not been very effective, as the resulting light showers were no different from ordinary ones.

Experts tell us that even in the driest air, there is a certain amount of moisture floating around, and the problem is how to combine these droplets of moisture into dense clouds that are sufficient to cause rain. Countless tons of water float in the air, and this water condenses around countless charged atmospheric dust particles to form raindrops.

Therefore, one experiment involves scattering charged sand particles from an airplane over the clouds to mimic this natural phenomenon. The famous scientist Sir Fleming has proposed using compressed air to emit flint particles from steel cylinders.

Mr. Hatfield, a sixty-four-year-old resident of California, uses a completely different method. He has been in the rainmaking business for the past thirty-five years. When he was young, he dabbled in chemistry, and as a result, he invented a substance that, according to him, when released into the air in drought-stricken areas, can cause rain.

Since 1914, he has completed thirty commissioned jobs under the principle of "no results, no pay." He has never encountered a failure, and once received a reward of one thousand dollars. His method is to erect a twelve-foot-high tank on a twenty-four-foot-high wooden tower and pour his secret potion into the tank. The tank emits gas, which spreads into the air, and then nature completes all the work.

He guarantees that he can double the normal rainfall of any season within a hundred-mile radius; however, he is not responsible for stopping the rain when there is excessive rainfall and flooding, so his method does pose a risk of causing floods.

Two Hungarian scientists have another method. They discovered that it often rains after volcanic eruptions or oil field fires, so they devised a way to create light on water surfaces, such as lakes or canals, without causing financial losses, and also invented a clever method of setting fires.

They claim that they can irrigate fields at a cost of just over two pennies per acre, thereby avoiding the huge losses caused by drought.

### Faith in Life

— Lei Fen

We must accept life, even if it is a tragedy. Only the weak are tired of life. Living bravely, we can eventually find a path to life; with the assurance of life, we can obtain the fire and heat to burn and sustain life. Therefore, we must have faith in life.

With faith in life, life becomes beautiful. We work, we sing, we read; we have love, we have dreams, we have a just conscience. And we will have a better future.

The world is changing. People are changing it, and it is people with faith in life who are changing it.

### Paper Sleeping Bag

Some people who like camping have tried using a type of paper sleeping bag and have been very satisfied with the results. Consequently, a paper factory has begun manufacturing it for the market. This paper sleeping bag has a lining and is waterproof, so no matter if it rains or snows, the inside of the paper sleeping bag remains clean and dry. This paper sleeping bag weighs three pounds, is seven feet long, and three and a half feet wide. There is a bag at the opening that can be put over the head to protect against the wind.

Essays

### Prejudice

— Li Li

One day I opened a picture album, and I flipped through it with great interest. Inside were mountains, water, people, birds, beasts, flowers, and plants, each stroke brimming with vibrant joy; but the second half of the album was full of ugly and terrifying sketches. What an inconsistent collection.

Life originally has two sides, and the pictures are a bit exaggerated. The second half was done by a patient, and the first half was painted by a healthy person. In reality, true life lies between the two. When we feel warm and happy, we see the joyful side of life, so we also think that life is smooth sailing, without any obstacles; when we are sick or depressed, we see the scars of life, and we can't help but feel wounded and disheartened.

People originally describe the world of life through the eyes of their own prejudices. If we want to see the truth, we must be impartial, treat everyone equally, look at both sides, and not exaggerate.

### Sharing the Same Boat in Storm

— He Jia Zhi

(3) Guest Arrives

Huanglong had studied at the Ye family for half a year. His father lost a lawsuit, followed by a fire that killed both his parents. Huanglong became a little vagrant, eating at one house and sleeping at another, living as a vagrant for nearly three years. Later, he went to work as an apprentice in a rice mill in Huagang Town, and always came to the Ye family to meet Weicheng during summer and winter vacations. They always maintained a brotherly friendship. This summer vacation, Huanglong did not come to see Weicheng. Weicheng asked his family, "Is Huanglong still in Huagang?" The farmhand He Zixing said, "I heard that he stole something from someone and doesn't dare to go to Huagang anymore." Weicheng said, "He must have been wronged. He wouldn't steal things. Robbing, I could believe that but stealing, he absolutely wouldn't do it."

Tonight, Huanglong is a guest at the Ye family again. He undid the button at his collar, put one foot on the ground and squatted on the chair with the other, drinking sorghum wine. Weicheng had already finished a bowl of thin porridge and was lying on a rattan chair. Huanglong raised his glass, brought it to his lips, and then put it down again. Weicheng said, "Brother Long, just drink your wine, don't be reserved." Huanglong smiled and said, "Brother Weicheng, tell this little girl to go away, she's staring at me and making me embarrassed to drink." Weicheng waved his hand and said, "Xique, go outside, don't come in unless I call you." Xique said, "The second mistress told me to look after the young master, saying that the young master should go to bed early." Weicheng said, "I know, please put the second mistress at ease. Did you add another bed in my room?" Xique nodded and went out. Weicheng said, "Brother Long, I don't have the heart to sleep on a hard pillow, I'm really unfilial." Huanglong first drank a cup of wine, smacked his lips savoring the remaining taste, and smiled, "What? You've studied too much and don't speak plain language anymore, I don't understand." (45)
