### British Wartime Cabinet Reorganized: Churchill Remains Prime Minister, Cabinet Members Reduced from Nine to Seven, Cripps Appointed Lord Privy Seal

London, February 20th (Reuters) – The British Cabinet has now been reorganized as follows: Prime Minister, Minister of Finance and Minister of Defence, Churchill; Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Dominion Affairs, Attlee (formerly Lord Privy Seal); Lord Privy Seal and Leader of the House of Commons, Cripps (formerly Ambassador to the Soviet Union); Lord President of the Council, Anderson; Foreign Secretary, Eden (reappointed); Minister of State, Lyttelton (formerly Minister of State in the Near East); Minister of Labour, Bevin. All the above are members of the wartime cabinet. The wartime cabinet originally had nine members, now reduced to seven. As for the former Minister of Aircraft Production, Beaverbrook, he has left the wartime cabinet and will be stationed in the United States to oversee the coordination of resources between Britain and the United States. After the cabinet reshuffle, Prime Minister Churchill, except for extremely important periods, may not need to attend the House of Commons to report on military and political affairs and answer questions from members of Parliament, which can be handled by Cripps instead.

London, February 19th (Havas) – King George VI received the former Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Sir Stafford Cripps, today and had lunch with him.

London, February 17th (Havas) – King George VI summoned Prime Minister Churchill today and had lunch with him.

London, February 15th (Havas) – Prime Minister Churchill delivered a broadcast address to the nation on this, the darkest day of the British Empire, reporting that Singapore and the entire Malay Peninsula had fallen. He urged listeners not to be disappointed and not to use the current setbacks to attack the government. Churchill's speech was rebroadcast by various American radio stations. He first recounted the evolution of the European war before the outbreak of the Pacific war, stating briefly: "When President Roosevelt and I signed the Atlantic Charter, the Germans were planning to crush the Red Army in order to occupy major Soviet cities. Britain fought alone, suffering oppression everywhere, relying solely on valuable American military supplies to survive. We were unable to fight Japan because we were assisting the Soviet Union in fighting Hitler. However, in 1941, our position had improved greatly compared to the dark days of 1940. The most important fact was that the United States was of one heart and mind with us, fighting side by side. Therefore, I crossed the Atlantic again to meet with President Roosevelt for the second time and comprehensively allocate all the resources of Britain and the United States." At this point, Churchill touched on the situation in the Soviet Union, emphasizing that Leningrad and Moscow were still in the hands of the Red Army, and that Japan's entry into the war was another fact that we should consider. In the past, because we were fighting Germany and Italy, we could not defend the Far East and confront Japan alone, because we were defending the Nile and other regions, and our resources had already been used to the extreme. There was not a single ship, vehicle, or aircraft that was not being used. While we defended our own territory, we had to assist the Soviet Union. If Japan had entered the war at that time, our only hope was to expect the United States to fight alongside us." Churchill then admitted that the British government had previously doubted that Japan would necessarily enter the war to confront the British-American alliance, because Japan had not attacked Britain in more favorable circumstances. The strength of the Japanese war machine should not be underestimated, as facts have now proven. However, if we were not restrained by Germany and Italy, we would be able to make full preparations. Churchill concluded by urging the people to continue to resist, emulating the spirit of the Soviet people, because Moscow was threatened during the darkest period in Soviet history, but the Soviet people never weakened the power of their leaders. It goes without saying that the British democratic system should be absolutely preserved, but the setbacks in the war should not be used to oppose the government. It must be understood that Singapore has now fallen, the Malay Peninsula has also been occupied, and other dangers are threatening us. However, the facts of our past overcoming difficulties are all there, and the people of the country should not find it difficult to recall them. This is the time for Britain to show a spirit of calm and perseverance. The future of mankind depends on our efforts and actions, he said.

To the south was the Imperial Dockyard, with two 1,000-ton ships overturned in it. The city's chamber of commerce and many banks had been converted into Red Cross societies.

Colonel Kamada's Remarks

Colonel Kamada, the head of the press department of the Japanese China Area Fleet, said in a speech: "I am extremely pleased to have received the Japanese army's announcement of the complete occupation of Singapore. Only seven weeks have passed since the start of the Greater East Asia War, and Singapore has succumbed to the might of the Japanese army. I would like to express my sincere gratitude to the officers and soldiers of the Japanese army for their profound strategy and courageous and agile autonomy. The so-called anti-Axis countries under the guidance of Britain and the United States have imposed unreasonable oppression on Japan. This time, Japan resolutely took up the sword of justice. Without delay, the American Pacific Fleet was defeated by the Japanese army in the waters off Hawaii. Subsequently, the Japanese army annihilated the British Far East Fleet in the Malayan waters and the Dutch East Indies Fleet in the Java Sea. By this point, the enemy fleet has become demoralized and unable to do anything. Now that its last base, Singapore, has been captured, the so-called anti-Axis front has no room for activity in East Asia in the future. Moreover, the important resources of the South Sea are all under the control of Japan, which will promote the smooth construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere."

### Hua Weier Discusses the Qualities of a General (Part Two)

I remember many years ago, when I was still a young military officer, a friend in a mountain artillery unit told me that in the past, whenever a new model mountain gun was manufactured and submitted to the Ordnance Committee for testing, it would first be transported to the top of a tower several hundred feet high and pushed to the ground. If the gun was still usable after landing, it would then be test-fired. If it was unusable, it would be considered fragile and rejected. The committee's reasoning was that mules and mountain guns were very likely to slip and fall on mountain slopes, so they had to have the strength to withstand such minor mishaps. For the same reason, we know that rifles and automatic machine guns, after being sent to the Small Arms Committee, would first be buried in mud for about forty-eight hours before being tested for firepower. This principle can be illustrated by an incident in the last Great War. At that time, when the Canadian army arrived in France, the rifles they brought were Ross rifles, which had excellent shooting records at the Bisley shooting range in peacetime. However, when used in the muddy trenches, they became jammed after a few shots. Therefore, after a short period of trial use in actual combat, they were abandoned by Canadian soldiers, who insisted on switching to British-style rifles.

Now, talking about the state of mind of generals during wartime is like being buried in unreliable intelligence and uncertain factors every day, not just for forty-eight hours. Moreover, they are often subject to major blows at any time due to enemy surprise attacks, unexpected accidents, or sudden changes in the weather, no different from falling from a height of several hundred feet and hitting rocks. In war, delicate and fragile mechanisms are truly useless. This statement is also true for the mental and physical strength of commanders, as well as for the morale of the troops and the equipment of weapons. Therefore, everything related to war, including generals, must have a solidity that far exceeds the ordinary limits of strength. It is often said that British war equipment is too strong, seemingly unnecessarily so. Perhaps British generals are the same. But we can exceed the limits of strength, leaving a safe margin everywhere, and we will certainly not be wrong.

Whether war is an art or a science is a question that is constantly debated. The invitation to me to speak today stated that the topic was a certain department of the "science" of war. If the invitation had come from another university with an opposing view, it would probably have been called the "art" of war. But when an artist or scientist works diligently for years, whether painting a picture, sculpting a statue, or conducting an experiment, it would be unheard of if his competitors could arbitrarily throw huge stones at him, steal his tools, and destroy his materials. If such a situation really existed, how many great works of art or scientific inventions could be produced? Therefore, comparing it to literary endeavors, it can only be said that war is a competition, a barbaric and base competition, and those who participate must have the tenacious physical and mental strength. In war, the lives of soldiers are in the hands of the generals, so one must have a tenacious spirit to bear this tense responsibility. During the last Great War, many generals died suddenly of illness, which gives us a glimpse into the degree of tension. When you read war history, you should also note how many failures were caused by the lack of this tenacious strength!

### The Supreme Court of Lyon Announces the Crimes of Daladier and Five Others. Neglect of Duty is Judged According to the Newly Promulgated Laws. A Separate Secret Trial Will Be Held for the Diplomatic and Military Parts.

Lyon, 20th (Havas) - The Supreme Court of Lyon today began hearing the cases of the key figures accused of harming the country. The President of the Court read out the crimes of each person as follows: Daladier: As the former Prime Minister and Minister of the Army, Daladier neglected his duty. He made no preparations for military training, industrial mobilization, military production, and air defense equipment. He also submitted incorrect reports to the parliament. Blum: Blum implemented labor laws that endangered national defense. He was unable to suppress revolutionary propaganda, resulting in insufficient production. Gamlin: Gamlin failed to urge the government to step up military production. The organization of the supreme command during the war was also flawed, leading to defeat. Cote (absent): As the former Minister of Aviation, Cote neglected to organize the air force. He also nationalized military factories, further reducing military production. He also supplied new-style aircraft to the Spanish Republican government. La Chambre: As the former Minister of Aviation, La Chambre was weak and incompetent in dealing with worker activities, resulting in insufficient industrial production. He also provided false reports to industrial investigation agencies. Jacomet: As the former Director-General of Military Supplies, Jacomet neglected his duty and failed to supervise military production. He failed to make practical preparations for industrial mobilization in advance and failed to implement it afterward. He also provided false reports to his superiors and the parliament. Furthermore, on August 22, 1939, at the request of the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Daladier convened a military meeting. At that time, military leaders, in light of the defeat and destruction of Poland, raised questions and asked whether the government had confidence. Gamlin said that the military was ready, and La Chambre also said that the air force had made great progress. Daladier deliberately instructed them to give these answers so that the Minister of Foreign Affairs would not have to consider various military possibilities in diplomacy. From this, it can be inferred that the above-mentioned officials have been neglecting their duties for a long time, at least ten years. According to the order issued by the government on August 1, 1940, the actions of these officials constitute crimes. The punishments they deserve will be judged according to the law promulgated on July 31, 1941. As for the diplomatic and military parts, due to national security, it is difficult to announce them publicly, and a separate secret trial will be held.

Blum's and Others' Arguments

Lyon, 19th (Havas) - The Supreme Court of Lyon held its first hearing at 1:30 PM today to try the key figures accused of harming the country. After the President of the Court read out the charges, he identified the defendants. General Gamlin, the former Commander-in-Chief of National Defense, spoke first, saying, "During the trial period, I do not wish to say a word, because in the past I repeatedly wanted to submit my resignation, but I ultimately believed that my duty was still to be the leader of the French army, navy, and air force. At this moment, I again believe that my responsibility to the country and the army is to remain silent." General Gamlin's lawyer also claimed that General Gamlin's silence was due to his spirit of sacrifice. The general is willing to take all responsibility and does not want to implicate his subordinates. The main reason for France's defeat in this war was the chaotic state of the democratic political system. The general has no responsibility to speak of. France has always been known for its fairness in the world, and he still firmly believes in this traditional spirit. Next, Blum, the former Prime Minister of the People's Front Cabinet, spoke, expressing his surprise at General Gamlin's decision to remain silent, stating, "This trial, all testimonies will be kept secret, but now that General Gamlin has withdrawn from the trial, it is as if he is not here during the trial proceedings. In my opinion, France's defeat in this war was actually a military defeat, but because of General Gamlin's silence, it is as if the military part will no longer be tried. Therefore, I cannot agree with Gamlin's silence, because he must bear full responsibility for this defeat. The court has refused to listen to the testimony of military witnesses, which makes me doubt the concept of judicial independence. It should be known that the verdict for us has already been decided, but we must still strive to participate in the debate. Where the truth lies, it will not be difficult to find out. What you are trying is not [blank], but the political system." At this point, President Jaoce immediately replied that the Supreme Court of Lyon is completely independent, which has been stated on record. At this point, Blum's lawyer claimed that French law has never recognized the principle of "retroactivity," but the law on which this court is based was made after the fact, which is very inappropriate. Finally, former Prime Minister Daladier spoke, saying, "I have been detained for seventeen months and have never had the opportunity to defend myself. In the current European war, Germany is the main culprit and should bear full responsibility. However, Germany is trying its best to evade this responsibility." President Jaoce immediately warned Daladier that if he continued to involve foreign countries, the trial would be changed to a secret trial. Daladier then said, "After I took office as Minister of the Army, I realized the actual situation of the French army and immediately took various steps to improve the French army. Based on this, who is responsible for this defeat? I believe that our military leaders should be responsible. They dispersed our military strength. We had a large number of weapons stored in our country, but they did not know how to use them. My conscience is absolutely pure. I trust the court, respect the dignity of French justice, and believe that the traditional virtues of the French people have never been extinguished."

### Rice Prices Increase Daily, Supply Insufficient: Citizens Advised to Supplement Diet with Corn

In the near future, rice shops will be given a grace period to sell corn. The Public Works Department has issued a proclamation urging citizens to switch to corn, as follows: "Since the beginning of Chinese history, rice has been the main food for the people. There is no doubt that rice is the most suitable food for Chinese people, not only because of its nutritional value but also because of its reasonable price and abundant supply. However, since the outbreak of the war, rice prices in Shanghai have risen daily and the supply has been gradually exhausted. Therefore, for the sake of the citizens, the urgent task is to consider adopting a food that can be eaten in combination with rice or completely replace rice when necessary.

Sold at Four Times the Price of Foreign Rice

When choosing a substitute, attention should be paid to ensuring that its quality is not too different from rice. For example, potatoes and beans are rich in nutrients and are inexpensive, but it is not easy to switch to these foods in a short period of time because their quality is very different from rice. As for corn (i.e., pearl rice), which is similar to rice and contains the same nutrients but is cheaper, it is the best choice. In the near future, corn will be sold in rice shops throughout the city. The amount allowed to be purchased each time is in a ratio of one part corn to four parts rice. Corn is cooked in the same way as rice, and the taste is good when mixed in equal parts. In addition, corn can be mixed with rice or cooked alone as porridge for breakfast. Fine-ground corn should be used for porridge, while coarse-ground corn can be mixed with rice or porridge. Now, the Food Control Committee of this Bureau urges the citizens of this city to try to eat corn in combination with rice so that the supply of stored rice can be extended and at the same time develop the habit of eating this food, which is no different from rice but is cheaper.

Registration Method for Corn Products

The Public Works Department recently issued Proclamation No. 5793, stating that in order to use corn flour and crushed corn as part of flour and rice, the Bureau hereby announces the following: All owners of various crushed corn or corn flour stored in the Public Concession must register these stocks with the Bureau no later than 12:00 noon on Tuesday, the 24th of this month. The registration location is the Bureau's Price Control Office on the fifth floor of the Asiatic Petroleum Company Building at No. 1 The Bund. Registration forms can be obtained from that office. Stocks that have not been registered after that day will be confiscated without compensation. From the 21st of this month, it is forbidden to transport or export any kind of corn flour or crushed corn exceeding 25 pounds in the Public Concession without first obtaining a permit from the Bureau. Transportation permits can be obtained from the following locations: (A) Corn Flour: Office No. 801, General Office of the Bureau, No. 209 Jiangxi Road; (B) Crushed Corn: Office No. 701, General Office of the Bureau, No. 209 Jiangxi Road. A fee of two corners per bag weighing 49 pounds will be charged.

### Most of the Public Concession Lockdown Has Been Lifted

Several terrorist incidents occurred in the Public Concession on the evening of February 14th (i.e., Lunar New Year's Eve). The Japanese military authorities imposed a lockdown on the incident locations and their vicinity. The situation from various parties is compiled below.

Alert Drill Scheduled to Be Implemented

The Shanghai Police Department has decided to conduct an alert drill for terrorist incidents and issued the following advance notice on the 20th: In order to prevent the occurrence of terrorist incidents, the authorities and the people will conduct a drill to arrest criminals. This drill will be carried out repeatedly over a long period of time until the goal is achieved. The general public must abide by the following items and cooperate to achieve the purpose of the drill: Those who witness a terrorist incident should shout "Terror!" loudly to inform nearby residents and pedestrians to do their best to arrest the perpetrator. Those who witness or hear of a terrorist incident should immediately report it to the nearest official or self-defense corps. Telephone users have an obligation to notify the authorities when they receive a report. Those who witness a terrorist incident must remember the perpetrator's appearance, clothing, and direction of escape and automatically report it after the officials arrive. Individuals or groups who bravely pursue and arrest the perpetrator or cooperate with the officials will be rewarded by the authorities as appropriate. Those who do not comply with the above items will be punished after being discovered by supervisors. The drill perpetrators will wear red and white armbands on their left arms with the words "Drill Perpetrator" written on them. It is forbidden to commit violence against drill perpetrators.

Statement by the Japanese Naval Authorities

The Japanese Marine Corps authorities issued a statement saying that when terrorist incidents occurred in the Public Concession on February 14th, the Japanese Marine Corps cooperated with the Military Police and the Bureau's Arresting Office to lock down the area surrounded by Henan Road, Avenue Edward VII, Yu Qiaqing Road, and Suzhou Creek. The lockdown was lifted on the 17th, but the four locations where the incidents occurred were still under partial lockdown, prohibiting traffic. The Japanese military implemented the lockdown based on the emergency announcement issued by the supreme commanders of the Japanese army and navy stationed in Shanghai on December 14th of last year. The suffering of the residents of the area, both mentally and physically, and economically, can be easily imagined. However, the losses and suffering caused by terrorist incidents are even greater and deeper. Some areas in Shanghai have now implemented the baojia system or cooperate with the authorities to arrest criminals. If all the citizens of Shanghai do so, terrorist incidents will definitely disappear. The Marine Corps authorities hereby declare that unless the residents of the locked-down areas become aware of themselves and work out effective measures, the lockdown will never be lifted.

### New Rates for Land Tax in the French Concession: Add 16/1000 to the Assessed Value

The French Concession's land tax has always been levied based on the assessed value. Due to the relationship between income and expenditure, and because land prices have continued to increase since last year, it is necessary to reassess the value to be realistic. It is now learned that the land prices in the concession have been reassessed, with an average increase of nearly double the previous assessment. This year's land tax will be levied at 16/1000 of the new assessed value, that is, 160 yuan will be levied for every 10,000 yuan of assessed value. It will still be collected in two installments in the spring and autumn.

### Departure of the "D'Artagnan" Delayed; The "General Joffre" Requisitioned by the United States

Since the outbreak of the Pacific War, international shipping to and from this city, except for Japanese ships which continue to operate as usual, has been completely suspended. In the middle of last month, two French vessels, the "Général de Trentinian" and the "Arbre Salués," arrived in Shanghai from Haiphong and have since returned to Vietnam one after another, as reported in previous issues. As for the French mail ship "D'Artagnan," which arrived in Shanghai from Saigon on November 20th of last year, it has been unable to return to Saigon due to the impact of the Pacific War. It underwent repairs in Shanghai and was completed in the middle of this month. It was originally scheduled to depart Shanghai on the 18th to return to Saigon and Haiphong. However, the 18th coincided with the Lunar New Year, and there was insufficient time for loading cargo, so the departure was postponed to yesterday afternoon. According to a statement released by the company yesterday, the "D'Artagnan" was originally scheduled to leave Shanghai at 3 pm yesterday to return to Saigon, but the export procedures have not yet been completed, so the departure has been temporarily suspended. Once the export procedures are completed, it will return to Vietnam. It is said that there are forty to fifty French and Vietnamese passengers on board bound for Saigon, with only a hundred tons of cargo. Whether this ship and the previous two ships will return to Shanghai after returning to Vietnam, the local company is unable to confirm. Furthermore, the 12,000-ton French Line vessel "General Joffre" has been requisitioned by the U.S. authorities. Before the Pacific War, this ship regularly sailed between Shanghai, Manila, and Saigon. In early December of last year, it came to Shanghai to transport a batch of American expatriates to Manila. After the outbreak of the war, it was unable to leave Manila and was taken over by an American crew on December 12th and sailed to an American port.

### Post-Holiday Gold Market: Sudden Drop

Yesterday's spot gold black market continued its decline. Although the intentions of Shenchang Sheng, Dayong Dai, and Tianjin Gang were good, the strength of the current quotation and securities gangs caused the 14,000 yuan mark to be broken, and then there was a sell-off. People were unsettled. In the morning, a gold shop initially quoted 12,650 yuan per tael (ten liang), up 50 yuan. A gold shop and Shenchang vigorously sold, and retail sellers rose up, causing the price to plunge 550 yuan to 13,100 yuan. Spot gold dealers Chengji and others suddenly vigorously bought, rising to 13,280 yuan. However, the Tianjin Gang's relentless selling continued, and Shengda Yong Shenchang and a gold shop competed to sell at lower prices, causing the price to drop sharply again to 530 yuan, breaking into 13,000 yuan. It hit a low of 12,750 yuan. After 11:10, Tongkang Yongcheng Jide Chengshun Yuan and others vigorously bought, rising 650 yuan to 13,400 yuan. At noon, it was 13,300 yuan, down 300 yuan from the previous day, with a fluctuation of 900 yuan on the day. Jewelry gold was quoted 50 yuan less per liang, at 1,400 yuan (150 yuan less for purchase). Fine silver was 14 yuan, the black market was 13 yuan. There was a lot of silver dollar trading, with buying and selling prices of 8 yuan and 8.4 yuan per piece, it is said.

Now, the report will supplement the spot black market conditions for February 14th and 19th, during the newspaper's suspension.

February 14th (Saturday) was the Lunar New Year's Eve. All markets were closing and ceasing business. The price was raised to over 14,000 yuan during retail purchases, between 14,200 and 14,300 yuan, with slight transactions. The price rose 300 yuan.

February 19th (Thursday) began the first red market (first trading day after the new year), with the market initially rising and then falling. Amidst the Tianjin Gang's selling pressure, the price had fallen into 14,000 yuan. Retail buying interest was very good in the morning, opening 200 yuan higher at 14,450 yuan. Shengchang's substitute Tianjin Gang's vigorous selling caused a falling trend, with the price plunging to 13,200 yuan. Upon hearing favorable rumors, it gradually rebounded at 11:30, closing at 13,600 yuan, up 650 yuan, with a fluctuation of 1,250 yuan. Jewelry gold rebounded slightly by 50 yuan, to 1,450 yuan.

### Shift in Domestic Debt Investment; Weak Trading in Foreign Stocks

The over-the-counter market for public bonds was on its second day after the Lunar New Year holiday, with a generally bullish sentiment. Most people were optimistic about the first red trading day, so the market price did not fall on the opening day. However, most market participants had already prepared to sell in the red market, causing the market to move easily and ultimately become unsustainable. Although strong bullish players were still absorbing, they were outnumbered. On the first day, it fell slightly by 4 jiao to 8.5 jiao. Yesterday, on the second day, bullish players and short sellers rose, causing the market price to fall further by 1.5 to 6 jiao. The trend indicates continued declines, partly because bullish players are still crowded, and partly because most materials have been released, causing a slight shift in investment objectives. However, strong bulls have not wavered and are still absorbing at low prices, so there should not be a larger decline. For example, Tongyi has been buying strongly over the past two days. Yitai and Hengxing have also made purchases. Shuntai, although initially selling, resumed buying yesterday. Dingkang has been consistently selling. Other firms such as Dakang, Chengjiu, RunDe, Xinhua, Yuxing, and Tongxing all sold yesterday, but in small amounts. The price declines over the two days have also been between 2 yuan and 2.35 yuan. Class B and C have even broken the 70 yuan mark again. Trading volume was high on the previous day, about one million yuan, but only 300,000 yuan yesterday. The following is a concise table of the results of the two days.

Yesterday's foreign stock market conditions showed a firm trend, but trading was weak, with a total of 6,600 shares. Opening prices were up 1 jiao to 3 jiao from the previous day. China Textile initially traded at 10.01 jiao, falling to 10 yuan, then 10.02 jiao. Ewo Cotton Mill rose from 26.25 yuan to 26.5 yuan. Sino-British Cotton Mill rose from 6.8 jiao to 6.9 jiao. Yep Guang Land was 16.6 yuan. Ewo Brewery was 6.1 jiao. Paper Industry initially traded at 6.25 jiao, then rose to 6.4 jiao. There were no other transactions or prices, it is said.

### Cotton Yarn Market Flourishing After the Holiday; Up More Than 200 Yuan Compared to Before the Holiday

The cotton yarn market after the Spring Festival holiday, because the yarn and cloth in the warehouse have been opened, the market is also open, and the participants are operating as usual. The market outlook is prosperous, people's hearts are good, and transactions are increasing. 20-count Double Horse factory single initially traded at 2,200 yuan, up 15 jiao from the end-of-year price. Then, profit-takers released their holdings, falling to 2,090 yuan.

### The Spring Breeze Revives All Things Again

— Zhi Cang

The warm spring grows grass, and all things are stirred by the wind. During the Spring Festival days, while one could not call it gentle breezes, a bit of warmth could be felt. But on the night of the Year-End Festival of the Wu [dynasty], there was drizzle and thunder, and the accumulated snow was quite thick. Taking advantage of the holiday, I quietly stayed at home, avoiding the suffering of facing wind and snow and shivering in the streets and alleys. However, there was also a feeling of looking up at the red sky with chapped hands and feet.

In the next morning, I finally saw the sunlight, and then I slightly felt the breath of spring. But it was very lonely. Eroshinko once said: "The loneliness is like being wrapped in a desert!" My eyeballs can still roll, but being confined in a small room, I can only face the wall. I also vaguely heard the sound of gongs and drums from afar, but they only revolved two or three times and then stopped. Listening carefully, it seemed extraordinarily lonely and dim. Of course, the frequent beating of New Year's gongs and drums is also a symbol of excitement for those who have worked hard for a year, allowing them to compete with time again. When I was in school, I had no good feelings about the games of a large group of volunteers playing music on the road, thinking that they were childish; but now, if I went out and encountered such an excited group, I would inevitably have a reaction in my heart - this can also be said to be a kind of "sympathy." I can appreciate the state of mind of ordinary citizens. There is no need to "shush" at this kind of behavior of asking for freedom since childhood. As the saying goes, "With the drum beats, all flowers bloom." People must compete with "time," otherwise it is not enough to call it active.

I envy those who are active, but why do I feel extraordinarily lonely these days? Have I already "reached the end of my days"? Looking in the mirror, I smiled and ignored it. I didn't have enough understanding of my own state of mind, so I drank a small glass of wine. This is the first glass since spring. It doesn't have to be, just as long as it activates my blood vessels without numbing my nerves. For such a glass, it's worth it. This is the function of "cypress wine and peach soup."

Zong Lin’s "Chronicle of the Chu Year" says: "On the first day of the first month, use money to tie its cane feet and throw it on the dung broom, saying that it will be as you wish." I also smiled and ignored this kind of eagerness to "get what you want," which is just the mentality of the "carp in a rut" of ordinary citizens. But from this, I remembered the story of "As You Wish": It is said that "As You Wish" is a kind of fairy. If one gets it, whatever one asks for will be fulfilled; but "As You Wish" also has its limits and cannot be blindly asked. … This is a "myth," but it is also reasonable. I have to pay with real hard work to get my wish, that's right. In the New Year, I am "satisfied and abide by the law" and unwilling to write a blank check for the family.

### Birth

— Wei Ge

A friend telephoned to tell me the joyous news of his wife giving birth to a son in the hospital. Sleepless for days and nights, my weary eyes suddenly opened, as if seeing a newborn to whom one could entrust hopes.

Children in the neighborhood scramble for New Year's money from their parents. Little ones sit in a circle, even playing poker, some winning, some losing, resulting in a mix of laughter and tears. They can't go to amusement parks, and their petty minds are set on creating trouble. In the end, the father acts as a guardian, taking them for a trip to the movie theater, already with its iron gates pulled shut, to give them some peace of mind. These children's behaviors are typical of urban children, they are learned; some indirectly from friends, some directly taught by parents or older siblings intentionally or unintentionally. No one can remain indifferent to these children.

Before children grow up, each has a great future. Even with abandoned infants in orphanages, we cannot decide that they will surely be ordinary people. If impoverished orphans are like this, parents should pay attention to children in families, in everything big or small, and guide them to grow into adulthood. They cannot neglect them due to favoritism, creating a foundation for future collapse.

Middle-aged people placing their hopes on newly born infants shows their own discouragement. If they know how to fulfill their responsibilities of watering and nurturing, those discouraged can finally have some peace of mind. Feeling moved by my friend's newborn, even though I have no children of my own yet, how can I know that one day I won't be a father to be proud of?

[P Everyone Sweeps the Snow from Their Own Doorstep
— Jin Yi

Snowflakes danced on New Year's Eve, not stopping until late at night. On New Year's Day, when I opened the door, the accumulated snow had already frozen into solid ice. The maid of the family next door was diligently working to clear it away with a knife meant for splitting firewood. However, the alleyway was too narrow, so these obstacles of ice and snow were transferred to the front of my house. If my family's maid could also be so clever, then from there to here, from here to there... by the time it reached the last house at the end of the alley, the fact of snow piled a foot deep would be evident.

I once saw a Charlie Chaplin film (perhaps "The Gold Rush") where this tramp went door-to-door sweeping snow after a heavy snowfall, from house A to house B, B to C, C to D. His reward was a lot of money. Chaplin's films are rich in satire. I wonder if there's a "classic" example of this "snow-sweeping transfer method" in Shakespeare's collections. But in China, there's the ancient saying, "Everyone sweeps the snow from their own doorstep." Now I've witnessed it firsthand. Perhaps, throughout history and across cultures, "minding one's own business" is the best policy (?).

But the fact is that the snow in front of our door occupies two square meters. If I were to argue with that maid, the words "Good Luck Opening the Door" are clearly pasted on her door, and saying too much would inevitably bring about some unlucky "phrases." If I ignore it, it's inconvenient to go in and out, and if I'm not careful, I might even "fall flat." It wasn't until the afternoon, when the sanitation workers collected everything as counted, that I could finally set my mind at ease.

I don't object to "not minding the frost on someone else's roof." Closing the door and acting like an emperor is everyone's freedom. However, "Do not impose on others what you yourself do not desire" doesn't quite align with the principle of "minding one's own business." Firstly, others will at least have to "meddle" a little because of the "snow in front of your door"; secondly, if everyone imitates "transferring," piling up sand into a tower, it might block the alley, and admiring a snow mountain in front of one's own door won't be pleasing to the eye.

### Sharing the Boat in Wind and Rain

— He Jia Zhi

㈠ An Evening of Wind and Rain

It is said that the Huangpu River was dredged by Lord Chunshen of Chu. Like a white silk ribbon, it lies horizontally in the middle of a great land. The river flows continuously, I don't know how many figures of ancient and modern times it has washed away, nor how much civilization of the East and West it has carried. This is because the west bank of the Huangpu River is Shanghai, the economic and transportation center of the whole country.

The prosperity of Shanghai is needless to say. The crowded markets and the shoulder-to-shoulder pedestrians, these two phrases are enough to summarize it. Because of this prosperity, most people only like sunny days and dislike windy and rainy days, which hinder their outings. If you find something like "appreciating the rain at Huxin Pavilion," "listening to the rain at the racecourse," "watching the rain on the Huangpu River" in literature, that's in the poetry collection of a self-proclaimed writer, but it's not the common psychology of ordinary Shanghai people. Especially on Saturday afternoons and all day Sunday, it is forbidden for the heavens to rain; if it rains, curses are inevitable.

Here's a joke: One year, it seemed like the heavens had a grudge against Shanghai people. Every Saturday afternoon, it would drizzle, and by Monday morning, the rain would clear and the clouds would dissipate. This happened for a dozen weeks in a row. Someone even suggested: "The heavens know the leisure days of Shanghai people, so why not change Wednesday to Sunday, so that the week-long anticipation of fun is not hindered by wind and rain." Although this never became a reality, it shows how much Shanghai people hate rainy days.

However, the heavens don't care whether you like it or hate it. If it wants to rain, no one can stop it. It was a cold day at the end of the year, and it was raining again. First, dark clouds gathered, then a gust of cold wind blew, and the raindrops went from sparse to dense, from small to large, constantly falling from the sky over Shanghai. At this time, the No. 6 streetcar was heading east from the North Railway Station, passing over the Waibaidu Bridge, and proceeding along the Bund. At each stop, the carriage spit out a few men and women who mustered up the courage to brave the rain, and sucked in a few men and women who had already been blown and battered by the wind and rain. Looking down suddenly at the wooden-slat floor of the carriage, it became a few small rivers. A young student, Ye Weicheng, sitting upright, had a trace of anxiety on his handsome face. He rubbed the glass window with the back of his hand, trying to see what the scenery outside was like. But it didn't work. The thin mist inside the window was wiped away, but the outside was still blocked by raindrops. It was a white blur, and even the outline of the steamship in the Huangpu River could not be seen.

### Mei Xi Secretly Leaves Shanghai - Bai Yun and Shangguan Yunzhu Accompany Him

— Tai Xu

After "Mulan Joins the Army," Mei Xi's position in the Guolian Company was naturally the "leading man." At that time, he was assigned so many roles that he almost had the difficulty of being in two places at once. But soon, Mei Xi's position was replaced by Liu Qiong and Gu Yelu, and perhaps the founding of the Lianxing Company was for this reason. However, the Pacific war caused his "Autumn Only" to fail. With more free time, his spending also increased sharply. It was rumored that Mei Xi had a lot of savings, but in reality, it wasn't so. So, on the night of New Year's Eve, Mei Xi secretly left Shanghai.

Guolian Company received a letter from Mei Xi's wife, requesting the company to consider their years of service and lend 500 gold to get through the year. This further proves that Mei Xi's private savings were "unexpectedly" spent.

It is said that Mei Xi's destination is Qingdao, accompanied by Bai Yun, Shangguan Yunzhu, Meng Na, Zhou Chu, etc. Based on this "lineup," it is likely that they are going to Qingdao to perform "Autumn Wind Opera." If this guess is correct, then the plays performed will probably be "Thunderstorm" and "Sunrise," etc. "Original Plays."

With so many big stars as a gimmick, "some harvest" is no problem. However, if the admiration of inland ladies for big stars unfortunately has the same style as Shanghai's "devoted loyalty," then the results of the "harvest" cannot be predicted.

### Nothing Shown on the Silver Screen

— Yi Qing

In "Dream of Beijing", performed by LaFayette, a cellar scene is needed in the play, but there is no way to install it on the stage, so the space under the stage is used. LaFayette's stage is originally open above and below.

In "Chu Overlord" at Lanxin, a Russian was specially employed to manage the lighting. In the last scene of Wujiang Suicide, moving clouds were projected with a magic lantern, which was quite novel and beautiful.

Gu Yelu, Zhang Fan, and others will be invited to make guest appearances in Carl Deng's upcoming performance of "The Strange Man of Zhongliu."
