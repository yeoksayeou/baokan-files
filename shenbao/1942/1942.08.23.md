### Central Route Orel Front: German Army Launches New Offensive; Fierce Fighting Rages on the Outskirts of Stalingrad; German Forces on the Southern Route Continue to Make Progress on Both Flanks

Berlin, 22nd, Allied News Agency: The Supreme Headquarters announced last night that German forces have launched a new offensive in the Orel area, 160 miles northwest of Voronezh, advancing along the Orel-Yeletz railway towards the city of Yeletz, a distance of approximately 110 miles. This city serves as the base for the Southern Army's offensive against the northern German defense line of Voronezh. This offensive is still in its initial stages, and it remains to be seen whether it will be expanded.

Berlin, 12th, Huitong News Agency: Regarding the battles in the Orel area, official sources announced last night that the German advance has encountered fierce resistance from the Soviet army, which is defending its deeply entrenched positions. Recent heavy rains in the area have made combat extremely difficult. However, with the aid of German aircraft, the German forces have still managed to cross the muddy, heavily mined terrain and seize some enemy positions. The Soviet army has launched several counterattacks, all of which have failed. The German forces have pushed several kilometers into enemy territory, and after hand-to-hand combat, several enemy bunkers have been captured. With the help of aircraft and tanks, the German infantry has annihilated 5,000 enemy soldiers. German aircraft are extremely active in this area, having destroyed enemy artillery, roads, supply columns, motor vehicle units, and railways.

Somewhere on the Soviet Border, 21st, Havas News Agency: Today marks the 425th day of the German-Soviet war. The most noteworthy developments on the Eastern Front are the battles near Stalingrad and the increasingly active German forces in the Orel region. The war situation in various locations is summarized as follows: The "bottleneck" between the Don and Volga rivers remains a scene of intense fighting, seemingly approaching its final stage. The German army has deployed a large number of reinforcements, hoping to achieve a decisive victory, as this victory is of great importance to the overall war situation. The Soviet side has also deployed a large number of reinforcements, strengthening the Red Army's resistance. The Red Army General Staff has dispatched armored vehicle units to launch fierce counterattacks in various sectors along the Stalingrad line, but has not been able to stop the German advance. Fierce fighting has erupted from Kletskaya in the north to Kotelnikovo in the south, possibly the most intense of the entire Second World War. At the same time, the German army has begun to employ a pincer strategy, with Stalingrad threatened from the west, and increasingly threatened from the northwest and southwest. To the south of the city, German forces are increasing pressure along the Krasnodar railway, and the Red Army's fortified positions have been breached, with many bunkers captured by German assault troops. German forces and their allies are closing in on the Volga River delta. West of Stalingrad, a German mechanized infantry division has opened a gap in the Red Army's lines, completely disrupting the Red Army's communications in that area. In the Orel region, Berlin sources claim that the German offensive is of great significance. Since the 11th of this month, 14,000 Red Army soldiers have been captured, and 400 Soviet tanks and 200 artillery pieces have been destroyed. The German offensive in this area can be seen as the first step in a large-scale German offensive, aimed at inflicting a fatal blow on the Red Army forces being transferred to the Stalingrad area as reinforcements. The Soviet side also admits that the German pressure on the northwestern line of Stalingrad is very strong. In the Zhev region, the Red Army has launched repeated fierce counterattacks, but has not achieved any success so far. In the Caucasus region, German forces continue to advance despite the extreme heat, making progress on both flanks. German forces appear to have achieved a victory southeast of Krasnodar. It seems that the attempt to defend the Black Sea has failed. In addition, German forces have also made progress in the Grozny oil region.

Moscow, 21st, Havas News Agency: The Red Army General Staff has just issued a communiqué stating that in the past 24 hours, our forces have fought battles east of Kletskaya, northeast of Kotelnikovo, southeast of Pyatigorsk, and south of Krasnodar. There have been no significant changes in other areas. In the Baltic Sea, an enemy oil tanker of 1,500 tons was sunk by our navy.

### Exchange of Sick and Wounded Civilians between Japan and the United States

Lisbon, 22nd, Huitong News Agency: Under the auspices of the Portuguese Red Cross, Japan and the United States have begun exchanging sick and wounded civilians, medicines, and food in Lourenço Marques.

To date, 4,200 packages of food have been exchanged. The number of sick and wounded civilians exchanged is not yet known.

Scouring Resources of the Ukrainian State; Germany Prepares for Winter in Soviet Territory

Stanford, 21st, Havas News Agency: German Minister of Propaganda Dr. Goebbels, in a meeting with a Turkish press delegation, stated that German forces will still be spending the winter in the Soviet Union this year, and the war will continue. However, because the Soviet Union's war machine has already been greatly weakened, German forces will not encounter a major crisis. Last winter, we were in an extremely difficult and precarious situation. Today, the Soviet Union has lost most of its resources and its strength has been weakened, while the German forces can utilize last year's experience to prepare for the difficulties of the coming winter. When a reporter asked about the possibility of Britain and the United States opening a second front, Goebbels immediately replied that he did not believe that democratic countries could achieve anything in this regard. Since our country defeated France, our strength has far surpassed that of Britain. Opening a second front would only accelerate our victory, so we are now eagerly awaiting Britain and the United States to make this decision.

Somewhere on the German Border, 21st, Havas News Agency: German High Commissioner for the Occupied Territories of Ukraine, Koch, recently stated to the press that Germany's victory depends on the various efforts currently underway in Ukraine. The important task of the German authorities in Ukraine is to mobilize all resources within the territory. Ukraine must supply the German forces on the Eastern Front with all necessary food and must transport essential raw materials and wheat to Germany. All transportation lines must also be repaired. In addition, a large number of workers should be sent to Germany to replace the German workers who have been sent to the Eastern Front to fight. Although this plan is fraught with difficulties, the wheat yield is 90% of normal, so the rations given to the German people have been greatly increased. There are now 500,000 Ukrainians working in Germany.

### Provisional Measures for the Management of Financial Institutions; Minister Zhou Issues Statement; Implemented First in Three Provinces and Two Cities

Nanjing, 22nd: Central News Agency reports that the "Provisional Measures for the Management of Financial Institutions" recently drafted by the Ministry of Finance have been promulgated. Minister Zhou, regarding this matter, has issued the following statement: The "Provisional Measures for the Management of Financial Institutions" recently drafted by this Ministry have been submitted and approved for implementation. At the time of promulgation, the following points are specifically stated: Investigating the economy and stabilizing finance are the inherent responsibilities of this Ministry. Banks are the organs for regulating finance, and finance is the lifeblood of industry and commerce. Its ebb and flow directly relate to the rise and fall of various industries and indirectly affect the prosperity and decline of society. If the government does not strictly establish regulations and implement appropriate management, it will not be sufficient for adjustment and compliance. In March of the 20th year of the Republic [1931], the National Government promulgated the Banking Law, but due to various reasons, it has not been implemented to this day. In order to meet the needs of society, this Ministry, after the National Government returned to the capital, has appropriately amended the previously promulgated "Banking Registration Regulations" and its "Implementing Rules" to serve as a basis. However, the aforementioned regulations and rules were inadequate and simplified, so the "Provisional Measures for the Management of Financial Institutions," comprising a total of seventeen articles, have been carefully formulated to allow those engaged in financial activities to know what to accept and reject, and for this Ministry to effectively supervise and manage. These measures will be implemented first in the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, and in the two cities of Nanjing and Shanghai. In addition to issuing a separate ministerial order, this Ministry's measures regarding financial institutions will be strictly implemented in accordance with the provisions of these measures.

Article 2 of these measures stipulates that financial institutions that have already commenced business must, within one month from the date of implementation of these measures, apply to the Ministry of Finance for supplementary registration. We hope that you will pay attention and comply with this requirement. After these measures are implemented, there will be no conflict with the existing "Revised Banking Registration Regulations" and its "Implementing Rules," and they can complement each other, making the registration procedures more complete.

The above points are merely a summary of the main points. We sincerely hope that people from all walks of life will understand this intent and diligently implement it, so that this Ministry can fulfill its supervisory duties while safeguarding the financial system, stabilizing the people's livelihood.

### As Special Envoy of the President, Willkie to Visit the Soviet Union; to Explain the Truth of America's War Efforts; British and American People Urge Governments to Open Second Front

Lisbon, 22nd, Allied News Agency: President Roosevelt met with reporters yesterday and stated that Republican presidential candidate from the last election, Willkie's, trip to the Soviet Union and the Near East is in the nature of a presidential special envoy. His main task is to "explain the truth of how America is fighting." Willkie is also the leader of the second largest party in the United States, making him the natural choice. In addition to visiting the Soviet Union, this trip will also take him to countries such as Egypt, Arabia, Palestine, Syria, Turkey, Iraq, and Iran. It is best to refer to his title as "Special Representative of the President," as he will be carrying letters from the President, not only to personally deliver them to American figures in these countries, but also to personally deliver them to Stalin and other authorities in various countries.

Washington, 21st, Havas News Agency: President Roosevelt told the press today that Willkie will carry letters from me to the leaders of various countries when he travels to the Middle East and the Soviet Union. Therefore, Willkie's trip can truly be called my personal representative. There are rumors abroad that our country's industrial production has been greatly affected by labor strikes. After Willkie's visits to various countries, this view will disappear without a trace. In addition, I deeply regret that some civil servants in our government lack prudence. I have now issued strict instructions, ordering the heads of government agencies not to speak arbitrarily on any matter, even those unrelated to politics.

Bern, Switzerland, 22nd, Huitong News Agency: It has just been reported here that Willkie will be accompanied by Colonel Colds and Bernal of the U.S. Army Intelligence Department when he goes to Moscow.

Meetings are being held throughout Britain under the auspices of factory committees, unanimously passing resolutions requesting the government to take immediate action. The same sentiment exists among workers in the United States."

Andaman Islands Independence Movement

Andaman, 22nd, Allied News Agency: When the British army withdrew from here, in order to eliminate the root of the Indian independence movement, they took away influential political figures in the prisons. However, many of the island's patriots were rescued by the Japanese army and regained their freedom. They resolutely rose up to fight for the independence and freedom of their motherland. Upon learning that Gandhi and others had been arrested by the British, they were deeply angered, shouting that they would vow to use their blood to fight for independence and freedom without ceasing. Recently, Indians here have been flocking to join the Indian Independence League, led by President Davinson, to participate in the volunteer army. As of the 19th, 2,000 Indians had joined and training has already begun. According to the league president, Davinson, he met his Indian revolutionary mentor, Gandhi, twenty years ago when he was studying at university. At that time, he vowed to become Gandhi's comrade. The following year, he initiated an independence movement and was arrested, imprisoned in Lahore prison for three months. He firmly followed Gandhi's words, waiting for the opportunity to come. Therefore, after being released from prison, he came here to practice medicine. For twenty years, he has been ashamed of having achieved nothing due to the strict surveillance of the British government. After the Japanese army occupied this place, we regained our freedom and obtained a happy life. Today, we can no longer ignore reality. If we do not seize this opportunity to become independent, then it will be impossible to seek independence even after thousands of years. The opportunity that Gandhi spoke of has now been brought by the Japanese army. We are willing to fight bare-handed. I am determined to stand at the head of the volunteer army, in front of the machine guns, and lead my compatriots to fight.

### Electricity Company and Central China Water and Electricity Company Plan to Connect Main Generators; Coal Price Reduction and Electricity Surcharge Increase Reduced; Water and Gas Items Failed to be Reduced

Because the Shanghai Electric Power Company's coal price was reduced by 14 yuan per ton, it has reduced the fuel surcharge charged to users by 15%, and it has been retroactively calculated from June 20th. This is the first step to reduce public utilities costs with the help of the authorities.

Users May Not Have Noticed

Few electric power company users may have noticed the reduction in the fuel surcharge on their monthly bills. Some large manufacturers who closely investigate their monthly electricity consumption may already know about the fuel surcharge reduction, but ordinary household users have not noticed. It is investigated that the basic electricity fee is one yuan per kilowatt hour in Central Reserve Certificates, implemented from [blank] of this year, [blank] reduced.

Reduction of Seven Cents Per Kilowatt Hour

The reduction refers to the fuel surcharge with the letters "SC" on the bill. From May 20th to June 19th, the fuel surcharge was 56 cents per kilowatt hour, and [blank] was 49 cents per kilowatt hour. After a 15% reduction, [blank] , there has been no formal announcement about this matter. The public believes that if the price [blank] is further reduced, then the electric power company will once again reduce its fuel surcharge.

Water and Gas Not Reduced

An [blank] of the Shanghai Waterworks Company stated that [blank] they did not know about this. [Blank] The waterworks company is currently not [blank] reducing water charges. Since the change from old legal tender to Central Reserve Certificates, water charges have not changed. Furthermore, an official from the Shanghai Gas Company stated that the company issued an announcement on July 24th explaining the business losses, and new fees were implemented on May 20th to compensate for them. Until the losses have been compensated, it is not possible to reduce gas charges. As for when the losses can be fully compensated, [blank] he could not determine, as it would depend on the supply of raw materials and the manufacture of gas, etc.

Connection Under Discussion

It is heard that the matter of connecting the main power lines of the Shanghai Electric Power Company and the Central China Water and Electricity Company to unify the distribution of electricity is still under discussion. This plan is still in its initial stages. Once approval is obtained from the Asia Development Board and the necessary materials are available, the two companies [blank] will begin to centralize the electricity supply in order to save on power generation costs.

At the same time, twelve cases were discovered in the Public Settlement, with two deaths as well. Although most citizens have now been vaccinated, the Public Settlement is facing its entrants and is still sending personnel from the police station to ask them to show their anti-epidemic certificates.

### Shanghai Divided into Two Air Defense Zones; One Naval Zone, One Army Zone; Light Control Assigned to Baojia

After the Japanese naval and army authorities announced that Shanghai would conduct a blackout drill next Tuesday, the Air Defense Section of the Public Settlement Police Department disclosed on the 21st that it had formed an Air Defense Committee three days ago. The committee held a meeting at the Police Department's entertainment [blank] hall on Thursday afternoon, which lasted a long time and discussed the implementation of controls on street and indoor lighting.

Traffic Lights All Under Control

It is said that all lighting control measures will be stipulated by the Japanese authorities, and Shanghai will be divided into two air defense zones, A and B, one naval zone and one army zone, managed separately by the Japanese army and navy authorities. During the meeting on Thursday, it was decided to entrust the task of managing streetcar lights, hotels, restaurants, and indoor lights to the Baojia system, and the work of the Public Settlement Police Force will be [blank] adjusted accordingly. According to [blank] [blank] the electricity company, street lights are difficult to control. All thunder power, if not temporarily cut off, cannot be cut off at all. It is difficult to adjust the distribution of power. However, it is certain that preparations for managing traffic lights and car lights have been completed, as previously announced.

Police Department Responsible for Air Defense Matters

Goro Matsumoto, Assistant Chief of the Traffic Section of the Police Department, will be responsible for all air defense-related matters in the future. Matsumoto also leads the Air Defense Committee, whose twelve members are all Japanese police officers. The Air Defense Committee discussed at the meeting on Thursday how to instruct the volunteer guard corps to handle car lights, bicycle lights, and the limits of permissible lighting during the blackout.

Police Lights Cordoned During Alert Period

The proposed lighting control plan is as follows: During the blackout, the lights of cars, including headlights, sidelights, and searchlights, will be turned off. Only two lights are allowed, and the light of these two lights must be adjusted so that on a flat road, each light illuminates within ten meters, and the maximum brightness [blank] in Zone B is limited to three lux, and in Zone A it is limited to 0.2 lux. As for the boundaries of these two zones, the police have not yet disclosed them, as there has not been a definite announcement.

Zone A Stricter, Zone B More Lenient

In Zone B, during the blackout, there are no restrictions on the taillights, courtesy lights, and stop lights of cars, but in Zone A, these lights must also be turned off. Only one light is allowed to emit light, and the radius must not exceed 300 meters. The lights of bicycles, rickshaws, carts, or carriages, and other similar lights, are not restricted in Zone B, but must be reduced and partially covered in Zone A. Each light is limited to one candlepower. Flashlights and other lights with adjustable brightness are limited to 0.3 candlepower and do not need to be covered.

### The Japanese Army Air Defense Headquarters Issues a Statement Elaborating on Important Precautions

Regarding air defense alerts, the Japanese Army and Navy Air Defense Headquarters in this city have issued the first, second, and third announcements. The first announcement explains the general outline of air defense implementation and matters concerning alarms and lighting control. The second announcement instructs important civil defense measures for home air defense. The third announcement promulgates the order to implement lighting control. However, citizens have questions about various regulations. The Japanese Army and Navy Air Defense Headquarters have issued a statement elaborating on the following important precautions:

1.  Measures to Take During Air Raids

The various situations that occur during air raids are as follows: (A) Bombs explode, causing damage, death, and injury, and debris falls and scatters, causing indirect damage. (B) When bombs explode, carbon monoxide and other toxic gases are released. (C) Fires occur in multiple locations simultaneously. (D) Water pipe equipment is damaged, causing water outages and overflowing tap water. (E) Fuel and lighting gas equipment is damaged, causing supply interruptions or gas leaks. (F) If the enemy deliberately uses poison gas bombs, toxic gas will be released. However, the damage caused by air raids is not as terrible as generally imagined. Therefore, if dealt with calmly, the damage will not be too severe. The standard measures are roughly as follows:

(A) Each family should follow the second announcement of the Air Defense Headquarters and focus on fire prevention. (B) If outdoors, take cover with appropriate shelter. (C) Cars and other vehicles should be parked in appropriate places. (D) Government offices and company offices [blank] should take precautions in accordance with the home air defense and fire prevention guidelines.

2.  Preparations for Lighting Control

Lighting control is divided into three types: preparation control, alert control, and air raid control. In simple terms, alert control is when enemy aircraft take off from their base or may attack Shanghai, or when an enemy aircraft carrier is discovered on a certain sea surface, an alert control order is issued.

Air raid control is when Shanghai is definitely the target of an air raid and enemy aircraft are attacking. However, considering the performance of modern aircraft, enemy aircraft may not attack according to the scheduled time. Therefore, even when there is no threat of an air raid, lighting is appropriately controlled during wartime to avoid displaying targets to enemy aircraft from a distance and to prepare for the implementation of alert control. This is preparation control.

In view of the above points, the order to implement preparation control has been issued since the 12th, and Shanghai has also embarked on the first step of wartime civil defense measures. Therefore, preparation control must continue until the end of the war. As for the lights that should be extinguished during the preparation control period, sign lights are temporarily designated. However, depending on the circumstances in the future, unnecessary lights will be gradually sorted out. It is hoped that citizens will sort out unnecessary lights in their residences.

The Air Defense Headquarters hopes to implement preparation control to:

(A) Complete the preparation for alert control as soon as possible. (B) Cover outdoor lights from above so that they do not emit light above the horizontal, and paint the upper part black. (C) For indoor lights, cover the light source (the actual light-emitting body, such as the light bulb) visible from the outside with a cover prepared for alert control to the extent that its light source is not visible above the horizontal. (D) In high-rise buildings, the lights in rooms on the tenth floor and above should have their light sources covered by a cover according to the provisions of item C. The position of the cover should be such that the light source is not visible from 45 degrees above from below. (E) Shops with excessively glaring lights should reduce the number of lights or the light output of the lights. (F) The light output of display windows must be reduced. (G) Cover the headlights of cars, etc., according to the above regulations, but the angle should be such that when the car is horizontal, the direct light emitted from the light does not shine above 15 degrees into the air.

3.  About Lighting Alert Control

Lighting alert control is implemented in principle when an air defense alert alarm is issued. Therefore, all lights should be completely extinguished during that period. However, alert control continues for a considerable period of time, so the general public cannot stop working, and a minimum level of lighting is also necessary for living. Alert control is decided based on these requirements. It is hoped that citizens understand this point and implement it. During alert control, work should continue without leaking light outdoors.

4.  Regarding the degree of concealment of indoor lighting during lighting alert control, this has been stipulated in the second table of the civil defense guidance outline, which is now explained further.

(A) Outdoor lights (outdoor refers to places outside the storefront), such as decorative lights, hanging lights, display window lighting, and other similar lights, should be completely extinguished during alert control. (B) Ordinary indoor lights should reduce their brightness and cover their lights in accordance with the following points:

Doorways leading directly to the outside should be covered with black curtains. Lights should be covered, and the brightness of the lights should be limited depending on how the covers obscure the light. For example (rooms with 12 square meters 0.5 candlepower or less, the light output of one light must not exceed 2 candlepower.

6.  Materials for Lighting Control

(A) Black curtains for light shielding should be made of thick black cloth. When it is unavoidable, black paper can also be used, but paper is easily damaged, so it is hoped that cloth will be used.

(B) Light-shielding covers for auxiliary lights should be made according to the diagram above.

7.  Announcements and statements issued by the Air Defense Headquarters, as well as other instructions, should be clipped and saved.

### "Lushan Maru" Arrives in Shanghai from Hong Kong and Guangdong; Expected to Enter Port Today; Many Chinese Passengers Returning to Shanghai from Guangdong; Ship Has Been Docked at Wusongkou for Five Days Due to Two Passenger Deaths from Epidemic

This summer, the tiger epidemic has been rampant, and the authorities in this city have taken strict precautions. Recently, the weather has become slightly cooler, and the severity of the epidemic has decreased. The customs quarantine office is still strict with the epidemic inspection of imported ships, especially ships arriving in Shanghai from southern China. The epidemic inspection work is even stricter. No matter what ship, it must anchor outside Wusongkou for 24 hours, waiting for the inspection to be completed before being allowed to enter the port. The "Lushan Maru" of the East Asia Shipping Company arrived in Shanghai from Hong Kong and Guangdong the day before yesterday. On Tuesday of this week (the 18th), it arrived at Wusongkou, anchored in the Sanjia Water area as usual, and waited for inspection. However, it had not been seen entering the port by yesterday evening. It is heard that this time the ship carried many Chinese passengers returning to Shanghai from Guangdong, and two passengers died of the epidemic en route. Therefore, the inspection procedures for this ship are more complicated than for ordinary imported ships. It has been anchored outside the port for five days. According to the company yesterday, the inspection work was completed yesterday. If no special accidents occur, it should be able to enter the port this afternoon.

### There Will Be New Developments in Chinese Stocks; The Chinese Stock Exchange Association Will Hold a Preparatory Meeting

Yesterday, the Chinese stock market experienced a weekend trading slowdown, with market sentiment shifting from weak to stable. This was mainly because there were no speculative short-selling transactions in the Chinese stock industry. All transactions were genuine buying and selling of physical goods based on managing customer investments, absorbing funds, and selling off existing holdings. Now that the establishment of the Chinese Stock Exchange Association has been approved by the Bureau of Finance, the various misunderstandings that have been circulating for days have been swept away, and the industry is about to undergo a new phase of development. As a result, the previously nervous investors have stabilized their sentiments. Buyers have become more eager to buy on dips, and market prices have consequently seen a squeeze, especially in the case of Zhabei Water & Electricity, which broke through the 30 yuan level, squeezing up the most by 1.25 yuan. China Electric has stabilized, down by 0.25 yuan. In the cultural sector, only China Bookstore fell slightly by 5 yuan, entering the 170 yuan level. Commercial Press and World Book saw a flattening trend after initial weakness, with new buyers entering the market. In the department store sector, Wing On fell by 2 yuan, entering the 100 yuan level, while China Underwear fell by 0.75 yuan. The price of Sincere Company remained unchanged from the previous day. The pharmaceutical sector was relatively weak, with China Asia down by 0.75 yuan. Sino-French Pharmaceutical fell by 1.5 yuan, retreating to the 70 yuan level. Minyi Pharmaceutical fell by 2 yuan, while Sin-I Yi remained strong, with buyers still present at 830 yuan. The decline in Great China Match was also minimal, down by only 1 yuan. Nanyang Brothers Tobacco was trending flat. The stock market price list is recorded below:

Stock Name | Highest | Lowest
------- | -------- | --------
Commercial Press | 270.00 | 268.00
China Bookstore | 170.00 | 167.50
Guanshengyuan | 200.00 | ——
Home Industries | 327.50 | 325.00
Wing On Company | 101.00 | 95.00
Sincere Company | 100.00 | 96.00
National Goods Company | 107.50 | 105.00
China Underwear | 32.50 | 31.75
Dasheng Textile Mill No. 1 | 175.00 | ——
Great China Match | 175.00 | 172.50
Mayar Silk Mill | 41.50 | 40.00

Yu Mingshi, Zhang Deqin, Zheng Xuegao, Zhang Xiaoxian, Wang Yingsheng, Yao Zhaotang, Zheng Jiaju, Zhu Shangyi, and Jin Songgan have been designated as a nine-member preparatory committee, with Yu Mingshi designated as the convener of the preparatory committee. It is said that a preparatory meeting will be convened soon.

### Government Bonds Gently Fluctuating, Market Prices Vary

Yesterday, the government bond market saw gentle fluctuations, with a generally upward trend. Trading opened at a high price of 9.20 yuan, and various bonds followed suit, mostly showing gains. However, large investors continued to reduce their holdings of Type C bonds, so the prices were pressured down during the session due to the selling pressure. Types A and B bonds remained firm, with buyers hesitant about Type C bonds, tracking the sale of Type C bonds and buying Types A and B. In fact, the buying and selling of large investors is entirely related to the allocation of funds, and has no significant impact on the bonds themselves. It is equally possible to buy Types A and B and sell Type C now, or to sell Types A and B and buy Type C in the future. Therefore, there is no reason to believe that Types A and B will have a different trend from other types of bonds. In summary, the rise in Types A and B may reflect a general strengthening trend in other types of bonds, so sellers should be cautious and maintain a stable position. Total trading volume for the city was approximately 2 million yuan. The table below lists the details:

Category | Highest | Lowest | Closing Price | Compared to Previous Day
------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | --------
Unified A | 41.40 | 40.90 | 41.20 | Up 0.60
Unified B | 39.40 | 39.00 | 39.20 | Up 0.10
Unified C | 39.20 | 38.70 | 38.90 | Up 0.10
Unified D | 36.10 | 35.70 | 35.90 | Flat
Unified E | 36.30 | 36.70 | 36.90 | Flat

### Gold Ornaments Remain Consistently Stable

The morning price was 1,900 yuan, briefly rising to 1,905 yuan, before falling back slightly to 1,895 yuan. The noon transaction price was 1,900 yuan, the same as the previous day. There were no sales at the closing price, with only a 10 yuan difference. Trading was minimal. Silver ornaments were still quoted at 16 yuan, with an inter-dealer price of 10.89 yuan.

### Cotton Cloth Remains Weak

Factory Cloth: Yesterday, the market was soft due to the continued decline in Eastern cloth prices. Sellers were unified in offering goods to downstream buyers. White goods fell by 2-3 yuan per piece. 16-pound Globe coarse cloth was 179 yuan, Flying Swan 176 yuan, 9-pound New Character 109 yuan, 12-pound Globe fine cloth 158.5 yuan, Fookai Bank single 142 yuan, Dapeng Bank single hand goods were sold cheaply at only 141.5 yuan, Fookai fine twill 127 yuan, Magnolia bleached cloth 160 yuan, Qin Liangyu 150 yuan.

Wheat bran sales decreased and weakened. 250 packages of Sanshin small package wheat bran delivery notes from May were offered at 19.5 yuan.

### Xiang Lian Trials New Several Tens of Pounds

Several tens of pounds of this year's new Xiang Lian goods have been transported to the market for trial sales. Because of the small quantity, although there were offers similar to cold storage goods, it could not be regarded as the formal market. In addition, the near-market cold storage goods are very flat and weak because of few needs. Gao Zhuang is 750 yuan, and the inferior ones are different.

### Mother Yao's Will to Help Students

— Reporter

After reading yesterday's report in this newspaper, "Will to Help Students," we are deeply moved that Madam Zhao, Mother Yao, even in her last moments, was concerned about saving funeral expenses to help out-of-school children. This is not only a virtuous mother of the Yao family but also a role model for great maternal education in today's society.

The Madam was the virtuous partner of the martyr Mr. Yao Dingsheng. After the Reform Movement of 1898, Mr. Yao invested in education and founded the Shiceng School in his hometown of Shengxian. When funding was insufficient, the Madam always donated her hairpins and jewelry to help. Later, Mr. Yao suffered misfortune in the second year of the Xuantong reign due to criticizing the Qing government. The Madam raised her children in grief, and for decades, she devoted herself to maternal education. "A mother's education is as heavy as a mountain." Now, her wise descendants have dedicated themselves to society and achieved remarkable reputations, living up to the Madam's painstaking efforts in education. When we read "The Takizuka Epitaph," we feel the same way: "Those whose hearts are rich in benevolence will surely have descendants," and "Accumulating good deeds creates virtue, and they should enjoy its prosperity."

We value this account not only to praise a virtuous mother but also to hope that her sincerity will inspire a positive trend in today's society: save all unnecessary expenses and help out-of-school youth. This is more urgent than any other undertaking. The Yao brothers, carrying on their mother's teachings, are also worthy of praise. This kind of righteous act is "correcting the ways of one's parents, which can be called filial piety."

A model virtuous mother, a model family, benefiting students, helping people and benefiting the world, not only cherishing their own relatives and children, but also enabling outstanding youth to continue their studies. In addition to our admiration, we would like to briefly express our feelings.

### Water and Electricity Saving Methods

— Xiao Juan

In this era of high prices for everything, it is really not easy to be a homemaker. However, no matter how expensive things are, life must go on, so we have to save in some areas. Water and electricity bills are regular monthly expenses. Saving water and electricity can not only reduce household expenses but also conserve public resources. In a family, saving water and electricity will absolutely not cause inconvenience if done properly. Below is my experience.

1.  Ways to Save Water

Pay attention to turning water taps on and off: Recently, a new type of tap is hand-operated. When water is needed, press the lever to release water, and when not needed, release the lever to stop water. This type of tap does not have the problem of being forgotten to be closed or leaking when closed but not tightly. It is widely used in public places, but not commonly seen in ordinary households. Considering the high cost of water, homemakers may want to consult water experts to determine whether to retrofit this type of tap. This is worth considering. As for leaking taps, do not ignore them, and repair them immediately. The amount of water wasted by leaky taps can be staggering. Wash clothes in bulk: Do not wash one piece of soiled clothing, especially summer shirts and undershirts, immediately after taking it off. It is best to accumulate three to five or even a dozen pieces before washing them together. In this way, much water is saved.

Utilization of wastewater: The second clear water from washing clothes can be used to sprinkle the floor or wipe the floor. The remaining water from washing rice and vegetables can be used to water flowers and plants.

Daily savings: Usually, save as much water as possible when washing your face, hands, dishes, and vegetables. Because these are daily occurrences, even several times a day, small amounts add up. Each time you waste a little, you waste a lot in total. Conversely, each time you save a little, you save a lot in total. The so-called "saving" is not about not using what you should use but about saving on unnecessary overuse.

2.  Ways to Save Electricity

Pay attention to turning lights on and off: This is the easiest way to save electricity, but it is also the most easily overlooked. Often, the whole family goes to the dining room for dinner, but the bedroom is brightly lit even though no one is there. This is clearly an unnecessary waste. This is where the homemaker needs to be mindful. It is best to inspect the house before going to bed and see if the lights in the kitchen, bathroom, and hallway are all turned off. When using a desk lamp for reading or writing, turn it off immediately after finishing. When the radio is not in use, turn off the power.

Use good light bulbs: It is a waste to buy cheap and low-quality light bulbs. Old-brand light bulbs may be more expensive, but they are brighter, save electricity, and last longer. Although they are more expensive, they are worth it.

Use the most effective lampshade: The effectiveness of lampshades varies greatly depending on their shape, color, and material. This needs to be coordinated with the color and aesthetics of the room.

Attention should also be paid to the use of other electrical appliances: The voltage required for an electric bell is extremely small, so the electric meter does not run when the bell rings. A regular radio uses electricity equivalent to about fifteen candles, so it does not use much electricity. A commonly used 16-inch desktop fan uses electricity equivalent to about forty candles. Electric irons and electric stoves use more than 300 watts, consuming a lot of electricity. It is best to avoid using them or use them sparingly.

Finally, it is best for the homemaker to learn some common small skills such as replacing fuses and connecting wires to avoid being gouged by electricians. In short, waste is unnecessary, and this applies to everything we do. I hope everyone remembers this.

### One Gain From Housework

— Ziqiang

Coffee Stains on Clothes: For clothes or tablecloths stained by tea or coffee, wet them with cold water and wait for two or three hours. Then wash them with lukewarm water and egg yolk, and the stain will disappear.

### Twenty Letters from the Ge Family

— Translated by Xu Baiyi

The Ge family letters are written by Mr. Ge Laiheng, the owner of the American Ge Laiheng Food Company, to his son, and are filled with the philosophy of life. What he says is actually what most fathers today want to say. There are a total of twenty letters, each discussing one issue. This publication will continuously publish them starting from this issue, hoping readers will pay attention.

The following is the first letter, sent by Mr. Ge Laiheng from Chicago when his son had just entered his freshman year at Harvard University.

First Letter

University Education, Dear Son:

Your mother returned home safely today, and she asked me to write you a letter urging you not to overwork yourself, but I want you to work even harder. You must know that the reason we sent you to Harvard University is so that you can receive a lot of useful education there. You will know in the future that education is the most easily obtained thing scattered everywhere here, and a person can acquire it as much as possible. Everything else is different. If you want to enjoy your share, it is not as easy as education.

When I was young, I didn't have such good fortune as you, but you will not have the same experiences as me either. Many people think that to know the value of money, one must earn it with their own bare hands, and some think that they should inherit fifty thousand yuan from their father and try their best to spend it. Some say that to know the truth of honesty, one only needs to do business with slippery people, while others think that one must go to Sunday school. Some say that having a drinking father can make one aware of the harm of whiskey, but others say that only a virtuous mother is needed. When it comes to education, many people think that they can gain knowledge from others, newspapers, or public libraries, while others think that it must be taught by professors. But in any case, the way to gain knowledge is not an important issue, because the form is irrelevant, like a beautiful box that is discarded after others have eaten the contents inside.

I hope you become a good scholar, but I hope even more that you become an upright person. If you have a pure heart when you graduate, I will not blame you even if your Latin composition has some flaws. You can get one kind of education in college, one in the classroom, and one from your classmates. In fact, the latter is more important compared to the former, because the former can only make you a scholar, while the latter can teach you how to be a person. Education is also like eating. You won't know what you eat will develop your muscles, but you can know what you eat will cause illness. So whether it is Latin, algebra, or history, you can read as much as you want, and it will never harm you. Only enjoyment and sweet things will cause you stomachache, so you should choose carefully.

Some people often ask, is university education worthwhile? It is worthwhile when it can promote people's thinking. It is worthwhile when it can enable a young person to answer when others are biting their pencils and unable to answer. University will not produce intelligent people, but it can cultivate intelligent people, because a foolish person is ultimately a fool, regardless of whether they study at a university or not. You must know that reading alone is useless. What I expect is that you can apply what you have learned.

Your Father, Ge Laiheng.

### The Taste of Contentment in Poverty

In the previous issue, we published a dose of Refreshing Powder, which attracted considerable attention from readers. Now, Mr. Jia Gangan informs us in a letter that the article was written by Mr. Shen Zhuyu of Qiantang and is one of his "Tastes of Contentment in Poverty." The original wording is sharp and thorough, and it is indeed a valuable work. (Mr. Shen is a financial magnate in Shanghai. The regulations for the Qian industry were created by him and remain in place today. Mr. Shen has also authored medical texts such as "Zhou Yi Yi Jie" that are in circulation.) Given that the previously published version had slight differences from the original, we are reprinting it once more to share with readers. We deeply hope that you will carefully understand it and treat it as your motto. We also thank Mr. Zong.

Yellow vegetable leaves, stir-fried with salt, just enough to fill the belly; if one covets taste and indulges, will one not increase troubles when looking up and down?

Tattered patched clothes, priceless treasures, mended and patched year after year; filling boxes and chests for others to store, how many pieces can one wear until old age!

Hardwood bed, covered with soft straw, sleeping soundly without worries, undisturbed by dreams; brocade quilts and embroidered bedding prevent sleep, tossing and turning until the sky is light!

Old house, just sweep it, repair it in time so it won't collapse; how many good buildings nowadays become rubble covered with green grass!

### Introducing Several Nutrition Books

— Hua

Solving nutrition problems is not purely an economic issue, but an educational issue. At the recent Health and Nutrition Exhibition held by the Youth Association, special nutrition issues of the "Chinese Health Magazine" were sold for $0.20 per copy, and Dr. Hou Xiangchuan of the Shanghai Leishi Desheng Institute's "Food and Health" was sold for $0.60 per copy.

If readers are interested in nutrition issues, then the "Chinese Medical Journal" has books such as "What Do We Eat," "Shanghai's Food," and "Minimum Nutritional Needs of the Chinese People," which are worth buying and reading. Especially for housewives, reading them can nourish the whole family and obtain adequate nutrition.
