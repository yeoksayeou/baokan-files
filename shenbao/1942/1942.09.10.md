### The Soviet Union Disregards Great Sacrifices and Conducts the Defense of Stalingrad: Fortresses Are Densely Distributed, and Houses Are Turned into Fortified Positions; German War Reports Claim the Capture of the Western Suburbs Highlands

Berlin, 8th, Allied Press Dispatch: The Stalingrad battle has already unfolded in the streets. The siege warfare has not progressed rapidly. Fierce fighting continues in the areas outside the city and in the region between the Volga and Don rivers. The main force of the German army has already advanced from the southwest and is pressing into the city. Its vanguard has occupied a corner of the city and is continuing to advance toward the Volga River. The Soviet army is now rapidly constructing fortresses on the outer edges of the streets, burying a large number of heavy tanks in the ground. Other houses have also been completely fortified, making the offensive extremely difficult.

Stockholm, Swedish Capital, 9th, Havas Dispatch: According to reliable observations, the German army is now launching a new offensive on the western front of the city. The force used includes 200 infantry regiments, hundreds of tanks, and a total of 800,000 soldiers, plus 1,500 aircraft. The fierce fighting continued all day Monday. A small number of German tanks managed to penetrate the Soviet defense line. However, according to Moscow, the main force of the German army has been effectively blocked by artillery fire.

Somewhere on the Soviet Border, 8th, Havas Dispatch: Berlin today described the fighting in the Stalingrad area as a "siege warfare." The German army and its allies have been fighting near the city for five days. Although progress has been made on the outskirts of Stalingrad, the pace is very slow. According to news from Romania today, one unit of the Allied forces has occupied several houses, indicating that the Allied forces have entered the urban area. However, the German war report only stated that they had occupied a high ground in the west of Stalingrad. Therefore, there is no doubt that the Red Army is still guarding its positions outside the city. Currently, there is no definite news. What is known is that the front line is not a straight line. The advance troops of the German and Romanian armies have already entered the urban area, but in the north, the Red Army still controls the area outside the city. It should be noted that the western suburbs of Stalingrad extend for 30 miles along the Volga River. Based on this, even if the Red Army is driven back to the urban area, they will still hold a vast area of land. Therefore, the battle for Stalingrad is still in a fierce stage. Because the Soviet Union can still send a large number of reinforcements from the Volga River to the front lines of Stalingrad, the soldiers who have been fighting hard for several weeks will have the opportunity to rest. Once these reinforcements arrive, they can launch a large-scale counter-offensive in the north, that is, between the Don and Volga rivers. At the same time, General Timoshenko's troops also launched a counter-offensive from the north. As a result, the German positions were cut off at several difficult points, specifically in the narrow and long area between the two rivers. However, because the counter-offensive by the troops in the Stalingrad area started too early, it failed to coordinate with the counter-offensive from the north. Therefore, the Red Army only penetrated the German positions for three hours before General Bock ordered a counter-attack, which eventually drove the Red Army back to its original positions. This successful German counter-attack was entirely due to the fact that the German air force was still stronger than the Soviet air force.

Zurich, 9th, Allied Press Dispatch: The German and Soviet forces in Stalingrad are now engaged in fierce street fighting. The Soviet Stalingrad Defense Headquarters has ordered all workers in the city to immediately leave the factories and join the battle. They are equipped with rifles, hand grenades, and chemicals for dealing with tanks. The first labor brigades have already joined the street fighting in Krasnodar and Aluminsk.

Somewhere on the Ukrainian Border, 8th, Havas Dispatch: According to unconfirmed reports from the front lines, German armored units followed closely behind the infantry yesterday, passing through Stalingrad from west to east and reaching the banks of the Volga River near the city center. If this news is true, then the Red Army's positions in Stalingrad have been cut into two, and the battle has entered the mopping-up stage. As for the evening battles around Stalingrad, especially near the city of Kletskaya on the Don River, the fighting is fierce. The Red Army is attempting to break through the German defense line from the Don River to the city of Dubovka on the Volga River and join forces with the troops fighting in the Kalach district, but all attempts have failed. In addition, fierce fighting is taking place at a certain point where the Don and Khopyor rivers meet. The Red Army is attempting to cross the Khopyor River and enter the Don River basin, but there has been little progress. There are no significant battles on other lines.

### Fierce Resistance of Soviet Troops on All Front Lines in the Caucasus

Moscow, 8th, Havas Dispatch: According to military sources, after the Red Army retreated from the city of Novorossiysk, it has established new positions in the city of Verkhnebakanskaya and continues to resist the enemy. German war reports announced that fierce fighting has taken place near the Terek River, which generally refers to the fighting that occurred on the south bank of the river four days ago. In the Mozdok district and the northern part of the Grozny oil fields, the Red Army is trying to stop the German advance.

Somewhere on the Soviet Border, 8th, Havas Dispatch: In the western Caucasus, the German army has made slight progress south of Novorossiysk. Military observers find it difficult to understand the rapid fall of this fortress. Some believe that it is due to the withdrawal of the Soviet fleet. As for the whereabouts of the fleet, there has been no news. It has probably sailed to the port of Batumi, which will still be in a very important position in future battles. In other areas, such as the Terek River basin, the German army continues to advance despite the Red Army's resolute resistance. However, the German army has encountered very significant difficulties in attempting to transport heavy weapons through the mountain passes in the central Caucasus, so its advance has been slow.

### British Announcement: Naval Losses

Tokyo, 8th, Allied Press Dispatch: The Nichi Nichi Shimbun reported from Lisbon that the British Admiralty announced that from the start of the war to the end of last month, the British Navy had lost one-third of its warships, including one-third of its battleships, two-fifths of its aircraft carriers, one-third of its cruisers, more than one-third of its destroyers, and more than one-half of its submarines.

### A Japanese Reporter in New York Describes the Scene at the Time of the Outbreak of War Between Japan and the United States (1): Original Text by Inamoto, Director of the New York Branch of the Japanese Allied Press

Mr. Inamoto Kunio Iuanoto, former director of the New York branch of the Japanese Allied Press News Agency, was sent to Ellis Island after the outbreak of the Pacific War and has recently been repatriated to Japan. He has written an account of his experiences as follows:

The Sudden Outbreak of a Major Event: December 7, 1941 (December 8 in Japan) was a Sunday in New York. The sky was overcast, and the staff of the Allied Press News Agency were leaning back in their chairs, browsing the morning newspapers, feeling content. The atmosphere in the office was very peaceful. The reporter was even dozing off when he suddenly heard the emergency telegraph signal from the Associated Press telegraph machine. One of the staff members jumped out of his chair and ran to the printer. Just as he reached the machine, he exclaimed, "The fireworks have gone off!"

The first report was "Urgent: Pearl Harbor Under Air Attack." The telegram was very brief and did not mention the nationality of the attacking aircraft. Soon, another urgent telegram was received, stating that the aircraft were Japanese. Subsequently, the White House formally announced that Pearl Harbor, Manila, Hong Kong, Guam, Midway Island, and other important Allied bases had been bombed simultaneously. At that time, the reporter was doubtful whether the non-official telegrams sent from the United States could be transmitted to Japan. However, he still forwarded each urgent telegram received from the Western Union Telegraph Company, sending a total of about 20 telegrams directly to Tokyo within half an hour.

Several hours later, Western Union and Mackay and other telegraph companies notified us that they would no longer accept telegrams from the Allied Press. Since Japan was at war with the United States, we were powerless and had to sit quietly and let the overall situation develop naturally. Towards dusk, the Associated Press notified us that Federal Bureau of Investigation personnel would soon be rounding up Japanese residents on a large scale, so we needed to prepare early. Shortly thereafter, New York Mayor La Guardia broadcast a message, instructing all Japanese residents to stay indoors and not go out. We closed the doors tightly, sat in silence, and privately resolved to endure any hardship for the sake of our country.

As a reporter, I was very concerned about the fate of the two American-born Japanese employees and wanted to do everything I could to prevent them from getting involved. So, I gave each of them a letter in English, stating that they had been dismissed from the Allied Press and therefore had no connection with the news agency since December 7. Then, I gave all the money I had to the two of them and told them to return to their residences. The rest of us waited quietly for the Federal Bureau of Investigation personnel to arrive. They did not come until night, so we decided to return to our lodgings, exiting the building through a side door, fearing harassment from the crowds gathered in front of the two federal news bureaus.

After boarding the taxi, the driver drove along Broadway Avenue. I don't know if it was intentional, but every time the car stopped at a red light at an intersection, I anticipated being harassed by passersby, but everything went smoothly. Arriving at the Hotel Ambassador, the next day, as we were sorting out our belongings and making phone calls to a few foreign friends to get in touch, we suddenly heard a knock on the door. It was 12:30 p.m. on December 8. When the door opened, we saw several burly men, their eyes hidden by the brims of their hats, their hands inserted into their coat pockets, with something bulging out.

After these men proved to be Federal Bureau of Investigation personnel, they told us to go with them to the detail office to be investigated before being sent to Ellis Island. When these men spoke to us, they looked around the room, and their words and attitudes were very polite. When the reporter put his clothes in the suitcase, one of them even came to help, and he placed a photo of the reporter's family in the box.

When we arrived at the detective bureau, there were already three or four Japanese people there. The detectives took our fingerprints, placed numbers on our lapels, and took front and side views of each person for the record before interrogating us. Each person also signed a document, allowing them to legally search our residences. At this point, the procedures were complete. The reporter then had a friendly chat with a police officer, learning that the Federal Bureau of Investigation had compiled a "blacklist" of Japanese residents long ago and immediately made arrests after the declaration of war.

### French Authorities in Central District Discuss Further Measures for Baojia Personnel

Total Population Within the Boundary Exceeds 740,000

Efforts Being Made to Discuss Passive Air Defense Measures

Mr. Fa, Director-General of the French Concession Police Department, convened a meeting of the Central Baojia Preparatory Committee members at the police station on Monday evening. The meeting was chaired by Mr. Ma, the French Consul-General. Attendees included Vice-Chairmen Liu Xingsun, Quan Jing, Ge Weian, Yu Yongsui, Zhang Renzhong, Zhang Shankun, Yao Yizhang, and Wu Zhesheng. Additionally, Vice-Chairman Father Molise, Accounting Director Dou Ruifu, and inspectors responsible for Baojia organization in various districts of the Police Department were also present.

Faber's Speech

The purpose of this meeting is to build on past achievements and jointly explore better measures to maximize the effectiveness of the Baojia organization. The meeting began with Lieutenant Colonel Faber reading a speech to the French Consul-General, outlining the various measures taken since the implementation of the Baojia system and the satisfactory results achieved through close cooperation between the authorities and residents. The following is an excerpt from the speech: "The Baojia organization in the French Concession was first tested in the McReynold's Road district for two months. On May 31st, the French Consul-General issued an order for the organization of the French Concession Baojia. Two weeks later, the population census was completed, totaling 747,307 people within the boundary, divided into 246 Lianbao, 1,038 Kuo, 4,495 Zhong, and 40,642 households. On June 21st, the first batch of rice purchase certificates, numbering 733,772, were issued. From June 1st, registration of population movement began. As of August 31st, a total of 106,075 identity residence certificates were issued, with 60,853 departures, 36,203 arrivals, 3,613 births, and 3,534 deaths.

Emphasis on Air Defense Organization and Civil Police

On August 19th, the Passive Air Defense Committee was established in this Concession. The committee includes representatives from various departments of the Municipal Council and one Chinese Vice-Chairman and one Chinese member of the Central Baojia Preparatory Committee who will assume duties during passive air defense. Its task is to discuss various air defense measures in conjunction with neighboring authorities, under the guidance of the Japanese Supreme Command. In this regard, we are exerting our full efforts to assist in completing the organization of civil police in various districts. These civil police can assist in sanitation, fire fighting, and clearing teams when disaster strikes. If teams organized by enthusiastic young people familiar with the situation in each district are present, public institutions will receive more valuable assistance.

Donations Already Exceed Two Million

The above only outlines the main benefits of the established organization. Other achievements are too numerous to mention, and many problems will be resolved by this organization in the future. All of this requires a significant price. The provision of police booths and civil police, the establishment of various offices, and the large amount of paper used all require significant funds. All expenses are covered by donations from the public. These donations are collected by a special accounting office managed by Accountant Dou Ruifu. Within a few weeks, all donations have reached 2,525,740 yuan. This amount is sufficient to cover all expenses for several months. We do not know how to express our gratitude to those who generously donated to Baojia funding. In addition, the Baojia work and the Chinese members of the Baojia Committee have made great efforts. We should express our gratitude to Vice-Chairman Liu and the Preparatory Committee members, the Chinese members, and the Lianbao chiefs, Bao chiefs, and Jia chiefs.

Ma's Speech

After Lieutenant Colonel Faber's speech, everyone applauded. Then, French Consul-General Ma Jiehli gave a speech. In addition to briefly describing the various tasks of the Baojia, he specifically mentioned to the police officers of the Police Department that Lieutenant Colonel Faber would constantly provide them with guidance, especially emphasizing conscience, familiarity with local conditions, and integrity as qualities that police officers should possess.

Subsequently, the committee members of the Baojia Committee, such as Father Molise and Mr. Dou Ruihuang, especially Mr. Liu and Mr. Yu, and their colleagues and assistants, expressed their gratitude. Finally, Vice-Chairman Yu Zhijing gave a reply to the French Consul-General and the Director-General of the Police Department, stating:

"We are deeply grateful for the preferential treatment from the French Consul-General, Lieutenant Colonel Faber, and the Director of the Police Department. We hereby express our gratitude on behalf of everyone. It is an honor to gather tonight under the chairmanship of the highest representative of France in Shanghai. Taking this opportunity, we assure the authorities that we will continue to work hard to achieve the goals of the Baojia organization. At the same time, we hope that the authorities will continue to guide us so that we can fulfill our responsibilities."

### Conte Verde Returned to Shanghai Yesterday, Returned to Italian Shipping Company

But Whether American Overseas Chinese Will Evacuate Immediately is Not Confirmed

The Italian shipping company's Conte Verde, which previously carried evacuating foreigners from Shanghai to Lorengemarkus, returned to Shanghai at 11:00 AM yesterday (the 9th) and docked in the Huangpu River outside the Bund of the French Concession. Conte Verde departed from

Yokohama and returned to Shanghai

and was handed back to the Italian Post Company. There were no passengers on this trip. It is expected that the ship will remain in Shanghai, awaiting to be rented again for the next evacuation of American overseas Chinese. The hull is still light gray. This color was used during round trips to Lorengemarkus. However, the Japanese flag and the Swastika emblem on both sides and the chimney

have now been removed

According to a senior official of the Japanese Consulate General, the Conte Verde's return to Shanghai does not mean that the North and South American overseas Chinese in Shanghai are immediately evacuating to Lorengemarkus. The return of the ship is only a routine step of returning it to the Italian Post Company. According to reports, the Conte Verde carried British and Allied overseas Chinese, successively evacuated from Shanghai, with Maru and Ryuta.

### Luring the Tiger Away From the Mountain, Robbery in the Shop

Medical and chemical inspector Gao Luqing established the International Chemical Inspection Office at 27 Anle Lane, Jing'an Temple Road. He lived with his wife, Zhou Tangshi, and his mother-in-law, Tang Caishi. He hired Ge Wenhushan, a 19-year-old man from Zhejiang, as a shop assistant for one year. However, Ge recently became trapped by financial difficulties and discussed with his brother, Ge Wencai, and friend, Shen Guangda, about taking action against Zhou. At 8:30 PM on the 7th of this month, Zhou Luqing suddenly received a phone call stating that he was requested to go to 90 Dexing Lane, Pong Road, to test blood. Zhou hired a car and left. Shortly after, Zhou's wife received a phone call claiming that Zhou Luqing had been detained at the headquarters for not carrying his citizen's certificate and instructing Zhou Tangshi to send it to the Central Patrol Room immediately. She did not know that this was a trick to lure the tiger away from the mountain and believed it to be true, so she also left home. Only Tang Caishi was left at home. Several minutes later, Ge Wencai and Shen Guangda went to knock on the door, pretending to be there to test urine. Ge Wenhushan entertained them inside. During the interval, they used cloth to cover Tang Caishi's mouth and pried open a glass cabinet, robbing 3,548 yuan in cash and fleeing. Afterwards, Zhou and his wife returned home successively and learned of the previous events. They reported it to the Jing'an Temple Patrol Room. Chinese detective Wu Dekui and detective Yan Bingheng were in charge of the investigation. They went to Ge Wenhushan's home at 15, 286 Pingjili Road, French Concession, and found that he had abandoned his home and fled. They arrested the Ge brothers at Room 8 of the nearby Hexing Hotel and arrested Shen Guangjian at 12 Anyueli Road, Kangti Road. They confiscated all the stolen goods and brought them into the patrol room to await investigation and interrogation.

### Three Russian Youths Claim Drunkenness and Attempt to Rob Police Gun

At about 12 midnight the night before, Chinese officer Yin Wenbing of the French Concession Foch Road Patrol Room No. 28 was ordered to stand guard at the entrance of the Weida Hotel at the west end of the Avenue Edward VII and Alber Road intersection. Unexpectedly, three Russian youths suddenly came from behind and grabbed the officer, hitting him in the temples several times. Just as they were about to snatch the gun, the officer managed to hold the gun tightly and refused to let go. Seeing that the situation was not good, the Russian bandits dispersed and fled. The officer blew his whistle and gave chase. Nearby Chinese and Western officers heard the sound and came to help apprehend them. As a result, two were apprehended, one named "Pang Fei Lao Fu," aged 22, and the other named "Xing Tele," the same age as Lao. They were brought to the patrol room. During the interrogation, the two defendants claimed that they were only playing around while drunk. The patrol chief ordered them to be detained for interrogation.

### The Process of Being Sued for Collecting High Furniture Fees

Both parties signed a contract, which included 4,800 yuan for the furniture. After investigation by the Municipal Council, its actual value was only 1,670. Therefore, the Industrial and Social Affairs Department filed a lawsuit in accordance with Article 55 of the Real Estate Regulations.

### One of the Social Undertakings: A Nursery

The nursery in Shanghai is still a new endeavor, although it has been around for over a year. In order to understand more about the actual situation of the nurseries and the conditions of the children's group life in this kind of organization, the reporter obtained the consent of the person in charge of the Shanghai Nursery run by the Shanghai YWCA and walked to 66 Daxi Road under the scorching sun to make a visit.

Walking to 66 Daxi Road, upon entering the door, one sees quiet trees and green grass, like a corner of a park. There are a dozen children aged three or four playing. Two or three children are chasing each other, some sliding down from the high point of the slide, and some are teetering up and down on the seesaw. A nanny is standing beside them, taking care of them. No one would have thought that these lively children were those of poor mothers who could not afford to raise them on their own. They live innocently in the embrace of nature, a life that children living in attics and pavilions can only dream of.

Going inside to find a responsible person, I talked with him for a while and learned that since they expanded the number of places in July this year, they have admitted more than 80 children. However, some children did not come to the nursery on time, so there are only 70 children in the Shanghai Nursery at present.

The Shanghai Nursery has a temporary quota of 100 children, but because everything is expensive now and the economic burden is very heavy, the children admitted must be from truly poor families, the mothers must rely on work to maintain their livelihood, and the children must be examined by a doctor to ensure they do not have infectious diseases, be certified by a referrer, and be investigated to verify the information before being allowed to enter the nursery. However, in order to meet the needs of society, 20 places have been added for working mothers to board their children, specializing in the children of working women, but a fee will be charged (the quota is now full).

Two kindergarten teachers teach the older children singing and games, and nurses and nannies are responsible for the care and feeding of the younger children. They have all received considerable training, so the children's hygiene habits and food nutrition are all in accordance with scientific methods, with four meals a day. In the morning and evening, porridge and noodles are served. At noon, the older children eat rice and the younger children eat porridge. The side dishes are one meat and two vegetables. At 3:30 in the afternoon, snacks are served, and the older and younger children all eat homemade soymilk and biscuits. At a time when everyone is pale and lacking nutrition, it is fairly satisfactory that the nursery provides such a satisfactory supply of food for the children. It is hoped that people who are enthusiastic about social undertakings and child welfare will give more support. (Hua)

### Buying Spree Sweeps the Market; Government Bonds Soar; New High Since Currency Reform

Yesterday, the market for unified government bonds soared, and the upward trend continued to expand. The urgent demand from all quarters became more and more apparent. In addition, the lack of chips was the main reason for absorption by "major players," and sellers found it difficult to make up for their losses. Therefore, the buying enthusiasm on the surface was overwhelming, creating a new high since the currency reform. At the beginning of the morning, there was no movement at first. Seeing someone selling, they began to sell, so the domestic seed price went from 3.2 yuan to 2.8 yuan during the conference. At this time, people and households took advantage of the low price to pull up the price, and the momentum was very brave. In an instant, it came out again at 1 yuan, directly reaching 9.2 yuan. The others then followed suit, and the firmness of each price foot was very rare. As a result, it rose sharply by 9 jiao to 1.6 yuan, etc., and the transaction became more lively, about 40,000 yuan or so. A list is shown below:

Yong'an Yarn Factory soared to 1,150 yuan amid the buying spree. It was difficult to continue after that. The buying momentum is expanding. The department store Yong'an rose to the 100 yuan mark, Xinxin 105 yuan, and Guohuo was 101.5 yuan at noon, all rising by 1 yuan. The increase in attack was not as sharp as in the previous few days. Cultural stock business transactions were few and the price was stagnant. Both Zhonghua and Shijie rose by 5 yuan, both with the highest price as the final price.

Compared to the previous day, it rose by forty yuan, with a difference of thirty yuan. Transactions were sparse. Jewelry silver still listed at fourteen yuan per tael.

The first batch of several dozen loads of Yuanxiang branches produced in Xinghua has arrived. Samples were viewed yesterday. The quality of the goods is not very high. The shell color is not good, and the particles are not purely large. Therefore, buyers are still finding it difficult to meet the seller's price. The seller believes that transportation is difficult, and even upon arrival in Shanghai, there will be losses, and is unwilling to accept lower offers, and is still waiting and holding on.

### "Doctor" Who Commits Fraud by Impersonation

— Liu Songsheng

According to reports, a young man named Zhang, 28 years old, wanting to make a fortune, had a whimsical idea. Ignoring the fact that he had never attended medical school and had no medical knowledge, he opened a "Gastrointestinal Hospital" without authorization, claiming to be a doctor. As a result, he swindled more than 40,000 yuan. The case was filed, and he was charged with impersonating a doctor to commit fraud and endangering public health.

A young man with no medical knowledge opened a hospital and made more than 40,000 yuan in a few months. This shows that it is easy to be a doctor in Shanghai, and it also shows that the habit of Chinese people seeking medical treatment and taking medicine based on advertisements has become deeply rooted. This urgently needs to be improved.

In Shanghai, where people from all walks of life gather, it is unknown how many so-called doctors like this who commit fraud by impersonation there are. These people use the name of saving lives and helping the world to commit fraud and harm people. They openly show their faces in large cities and even openly publish advertisements to attract customers. It can be said that they have no one in their eyes and are extremely daring. If these doctors who are not doctors are not investigated, banned, and cleaned up on a large scale as soon as possible, then the danger to the health of the citizens in the future is truly unimaginable.

### Brother's Words

— Gangzhi

"Here is one hundred and fifty-five yuan. Take it to pay your tuition."

My brother handed me a thick stack of banknotes and said to me solemnly:

"Although this is not a huge amount, it is what I have earned with a lot of hard work. You should study hard and strive forward, and never fail my expectations and delay your own future!"

"You know the hardship of my situation in the past few years. I have exhausted all my strength, carrying the heavy burden of life's pain, enduring people's ridicule and contempt, running on this arduous journey of life without even a chance to breathe. In such a difficult situation, I really couldn't take care of your schooling. When your semester was about to end this summer, I was planning to let you report to the chamber of commerce and give you something to do to reduce expenses and give me a little chance to breathe."

"However, I thought about it for several nights and finally couldn't bear to push you into this vast society immediately. In your short years of education, what have you gained? That little bit of shallow knowledge is not enough to meet the needs of society, let alone stand in society. People say that reading more books will not guarantee you a job. Today, there are indeed many people with knowledge and skills who have no work to do and no food to eat. However, what work can be done without knowledge? A child like you needs education to cultivate him so that he can achieve something in the future. If I stop your studies now, I am afraid that your future will be buried by my own hands. I lost my education in my childhood, and now, when dealing with anything, I always feel that my knowledge is not enough, and I have no special skills. After working for ten years, I am still just 'hanging around,' achieving nothing. I have gotten into such a situation that even your tuition has become a problem. I am afraid that this painful experience will be my lifelong regret! What happened to me in the past is over, but I can't send you to follow my old path and let you taste my endless pain again. How can I bear it!"

"So, I cut off the idea of sending you into business and still let you go to school. Although I am doing my best to bear this tuition fee, I hope that you will study hard and work hard for your own bright future and for the new society of tomorrow. Then I will feel comforted in my painful heart. Brother, work hard!"

I received the warm banknotes from my brother's hand and listened to his words of encouragement. I couldn't hold back my tears and they welled up in my eyes.

### Sharing the Same Boat Through Storms

— He Jiazhi

(8) What to Do

Cui Zhen listened to Wei Shiqing's words with her mouth open. Her silent heart began to beat again. Wei Yunxiang shook his head and said, "He really had no choice. Those gamblers who won money were all daring. They reached out to him for money, which forced him to come up with a plan. He invited the gamblers and went to Shide Hall at night to invite you over. You are a living Guanyin and a living God of Wealth. With you, he knelt in front of me and borrowed five thousand yuan. So you are mine." Wei Yunqing said the last sentence, saying the word 'you' particularly loudly, and the word 'mine' particularly loudly. When he said 'you,' he pointed at Cui Zhen, and when he said 'mine,' he pointed at his own nose.

Cui Zhen's legs could no longer support her body. She slumped backward and sat on the bed, her eyes fixed on Wei Yunqing's face. At first, Wei Yunqing was still Wei Yunqing. Later, Wei Yunqing's face enlarged to the size of a bamboo basket. That was because Cui Zhen's eyes were about to fill with tears. Looking through a crystal-like glass, it was natural that the image would be distorted. But Wei Yunqing laughed and said, "Do you want to see the receipt Fei Changhe gave me? I have it. Cao Ma! Why are you standing at the door? Look, Miss Bian is crying. This is your responsibility." Cao Ma walked over, pulled a handkerchief from under Qunzhen's arm, and wiped her tears. Cui Zhen sobbed, "Old Master Wei, you have done all kinds of good deeds, can't you do one good deed for me? Just treat the five thousand yuan as if you threw it into the flower port. Fei Changhe borrowed the money, but don't ask a poor woman like me to repay it." Cao Ma said, "Miss Bian, you have to think clearly. Fei Changhe received five thousand yuan, which means he sold you to our master. Where can a person be worth five thousand yuan? The master especially likes you, so he offered this amount. If you have the blessing of heaven here and give birth to one or two sons and daughters, your fortune will be great. What are you still crying about?" Cui Zhen didn't listen to Cao Ma, but when she did, she burst into tears and fell backward on the bed. (End of this section) (177)

### Casual Talk on Pawnbroking

— Xiao Chaofeng

(4) Complete Inside and Out

The personnel organization of pawnbroking is very clear, divided into "inner staff," "outer staff," "middle staff," "students," and "off-duty staff."

"Inner staff" include those in charge of accounting, wrapping, money, and jewelry. The number of people depends on the size of the pawnshop, mostly two to three people, who also serve in other vacant positions. Those who work as inner staff must be reliable and trustworthy. At the same time, only those with the three abilities of Feng Ma Niu can occupy a seat. However, there are also those with no abilities who are included. Their work is very light. The one in charge of accounting is also the manager, with not much to do all day. The one in charge of wrapping assists in the price valuation, checking the redeemed clothing and jewelry ticket numbers every day and recalculating whether there are any errors in the principal and interest. During the annual sales period, he moves his brain a bit and bargains. Usually, when he is happy, he guides his subordinates on the advantages and disadvantages of identifying clothing and jewelry, as well as their authenticity, origin, and price. For example, saying that this is dog skin and cannot be regarded as fine wool, and that is Ceylon stone, definitely not the blue and white diamond you imagined. Also, you must not childishly regard the woven patches on the clothes as Mickey Mouse embroidery on your pillowcase, thinking that there may be new patterns on the clothes. Otherwise, you will be eaten by the tiger! Sometimes, when they are serious, they work with the accountant, putting their eyes on the edge of their glasses, hunting for all the actions of their subordinates, as a reference for oral rewards and punishments afterward. The one in charge of money also belongs to the class of great masters. In addition to doing his accounting work, he also takes on part of the management of people. The position of jewelry manager is held concurrently by one of these two people.

"Outer staff" are divided into the first counter and the second counter, with at least two people, specializing in external counter business. They work all day, and their work varies depending on the pawnshop and the amount of business. They must go through a long period of training before they can step into the position of the first counter. They must also have considerable cultivation in order to have the ability to deal with all kinds of people. If the customer is a high-ranking gentleman or a lady from a public mansion, they must be gentle and courteous and treat them extraordinarily well in order to win them over as regular customers. If a road hero comes with a face full of arrogance, saying that what is yours is mine and mine is untouchable, then it is difficult to deal with. Therefore, they release all their abilities, combining softness, humor, false flattery, and feigned ignorance in one furnace. They forge hard-won cultivation skills and offer them to the grumpy and fierce hero. After he leaves, they exhale a breath of black air that almost bursts their stomach, considering it as a public study. To find out whether the other party is a runaway tiger, they only need to put a little effort into the customer's items, words, movements, clothing, asking price, etc., and their tiger legs (weaknesses) will be revealed. Then, the shopkeeper puts on the face of an appraiser, arbitrarily ridiculing and scolding. As a result, the runaway customer makes a hasty escape without any chance to bargain. The appraiser seems to have solved a case and laughs triumphantly.

### Do a Little More

— Hu Bei

If people ask him to do so much, and he does so much, this kind of person is a slave. When he does more than people want him to do, he is a free man. In this world, we all have something we are passionate about. If we can do a little more, we can get happiness and satisfaction. - Words of Robberson
