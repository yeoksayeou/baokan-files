### Striving for Stalingrad: German and Soviet Forces Engage in Street Battles; German Planes Bombard Intensively as Flames Rise; Soviets Call on Soldiers to Die Rather Than Surrender

Stockholm, 4th (Allied News Agency dispatch): German elite troops under General Bock have concentrated around Stalingrad like a surging tide and are about to launch the final assault. The fate of the city is now critical.

Stockholm, 4th (Allied News Agency dispatch): According to news reaching here, German vanguard units have advanced to a point about 20 kilometers south of Stalingrad, west of Krasnoarmeysk.

Stockholm, 5th (Havas Agency dispatch): German forces entered Stalingrad last night, and German and Soviet troops are engaged in street battles. The fierce battle for Stalingrad has reached its final act. The Red Army's organ, "Krasnaya Zvezda," continues to make a final appeal to Red Army soldiers, stating that Stalingrad is the Red Army's Verdun and must be defended to the death at all costs. The German advance on the Volga River can be stopped, and Stalingrad can be held. However, Stalingrad has been reduced to rubble, and it is feared that Soviet troops will be unable to hold out. According to German reconnaissance reports, some of the defenders are attempting to cross to the east bank of the Volga River. German planes have carried out over a thousand bombing runs, and the army consists of no fewer than 25 divisions. The German summer offensive has lasted 70 days to date. Berlin is confident of capturing Stalingrad and believes it will issue a special communiqué announcing the fall of Stalingrad imminently. Stalingrad has been under siege for a total of 25 days, and the German army previously captured Sevastopol in 25 days, which can be said to be a coincidence.

Berlin, 5th (Havas Agency dispatch): A High Command communiqué stated that on the night of the 3rd of this month, German forces broke through the western suburbs of Stalingrad. The city is now constantly subjected to German aerial bombardment and artillery fire. Major industrial areas in the city are ablaze. In the southwest of the city, German forces have reached the banks of the Volga River at Saleptha.

Somewhere on the Soviet border, 4th (Havas Agency dispatch): On the 439th day of the German-Soviet war, the German High Command broke its silence and officially announced that Axis forces had reached the outskirts of the Stalingrad fortress. It is rumored that the fall of the city, if not a matter of hours, is at least a matter of days. Red Army positions on both banks of the Volga River near the city are constantly being suppressed by German artillery fire and appear unable to hold out. However, it is noteworthy that the intensity of the Red Army's resistance today is no different from that on the first day of the war. Red Army positions north of the city are more stable, as the line occupied by the German army between the Don River at Kachalino and the Volga River at Dubovka is only a few miles wide in some sections, making it vulnerable to counterattacks. General Timoshenko's Red Army troops are engaged in a major battle in the area. The Red Army does not lack air power, but the German air force clearly has the upper hand and air superiority. Although the Red Army can break through German lines and even consolidate occupied positions, it often has to retreat after German dive bombers arrive months later to bomb them. The Red Army admits that the situation is dangerous south and southeast of the city. German forces in the area are attacking with the "Bock" mixed force, which includes tanks and motorized units. They were invincible in the Koursk area, but the rugged terrain in the Stalingrad area makes it difficult to achieve results. As a result, the team advances only a few miles each day, then pauses to reorganize and advance between the Red Army's bunkers and tank defenses, which is extremely difficult. Currently, only a few supplies and reinforcements are arriving in Stalingrad via the Volga River, as navigation on the river is constantly being bombarded by German planes and artillery, making transportation difficult. However, the Volga River is extremely wide, and small boats can still sneak across. It is expected that the river will soon be controlled by the Axis forces.

Moscow, 4th (Havas Agency dispatch): The Red Army High Command has just released a war report, officially acknowledging that the Red Army was forced to retreat southwest of Stalingrad. It stated: "In the past 24 hours, our troops have been engaged in continuous combat northwest and southwest of Stalingrad and northwest of the town of Voroshilovsk. There was also fierce fighting in the Izyumovka area. Tonight, the enemy made some progress southwest of Stalingrad. The German and Allied forces suffered heavy losses in this battle. Northwest of the town of Voroshilovsk, our troops had to abandon a high ground under heavy enemy pressure and retreat to pre-prepared positions. German troops have crossed the river in the Mozdok area, and the Red Army is currently reducing the enemy forces on the south bank. In the Kletskaya area, our troops have occupied a village and broken through German defenses northwest of Stalingrad. In addition, there is still fierce fighting in the Rzhev area. There have been no major changes in other theaters."

German-Romanian Allied Forces Cross the Strait and Land on the Taman Peninsula

Berlin, 4th (Allied News Agency dispatch): The German High Command announced on the 4th that German-Romanian Allied forces, under close coordination of land, sea, and air forces, began to forcibly cross the Kerch Strait from the Crimean Peninsula on the 1st, overcoming Soviet resistance. On the 3rd, they landed on the Taman Peninsula on the opposite shore and are now expanding their gains.

Berlin, 5th (Haitong News Agency dispatch): The German High Command has just announced that German forces have now occupied the city of Taman, Tamanskaya, on the Taman Peninsula. The city was formerly a Cossack settlement and still retains the ethnic characteristics of the Cossack tribes. It has a population of about 10,000 and is located on the Kerch Strait. Most of the residents are engaged in fishing.

Berlin, 4th (Havas Agency dispatch): Military sources here stated that German forces crossed the Kerch Strait on September 1st and landed on the Taman Peninsula. By dawn the next day, they had reached the front lines of the Caucasus region. That night, a heavy rain fell, and German forces sailed to the Red Army positions unnoticed. Only after being discovered by Soviet searchlights did their coastal artillery open fire, but the German forces still landed according to plan. They soon encountered strong resistance from the Red Army. After a fierce battle and hand-to-hand combat, the German forces finally advanced rapidly. Although the Soviet air force participated in the battle, it was unable to stop the German advance. By 5 a.m., the German landing had been fully completed, and strongholds had been established at key points. The enemy attempted to retreat, but their main force was surrounded by German forces south of the city of Fanagoriyskaya. At the same time, the islands of Kosa and Tuzla in the strait were also occupied by German forces. By 9 a.m., this German force had made contact with units advancing northwest from the city of Temryuk, thus completing the landing mission.

Fighting for the Grozny Oil Fields: Two Armies Engaged in Bloody Battle

Lisbon, 5th (Allied News Agency dispatch): German forces have crossed the Terek River near Mozdok, causing the first line of defense of the Soviet forces defending the Grozny oil fields to waver. The situation is extremely serious. The Soviet Information Bureau also announced on the night of the 4th that Soviet forces are currently engaged in combat with German forces advancing across the river near Mozdok. British observers also believe that this move poses a significant threat to the Grozny oil fields.

Somewhere on the Soviet border, 4th (Havas Agency dispatch): Currently, there are still two railways connecting the interior with the Caucasus region: one is the Saratov-Astrakhan railway, and the other is the Guriev-Samara railway. Regarding the overall situation in the Caucasus, since the Axis forces crossed the Kerch Strait and landed on the Taman Peninsula, they have made further progress, but it is not of great strategic importance. After the fall of Anapa port, the garrison on the Taman Peninsula was isolated. According to Soviet sources, German forces on the Taman Peninsula encountered strong resistance from the Red Army and suffered heavy losses. In the Grozny oil region, both sides are engaged in a struggle. After occupying the city of Malgobek, German forces continued to advance and have reached the mountainous area. The Red Army has established defenses there and is expected to have no difficulties, as they not only hold a strategically advantageous position for defense, but also have good roads and a mountain railway that can provide supplies from Baku and Tbilisi without any difficulties. Therefore, the positions of both sides in the central Caucasus region have not changed. It can be asserted that the German side is unwilling to have its troops fight hard in the central Caucasus Mountains.

### Franco Devotes Himself to Governance, Seeking Internal Unification; Only Reason for Recent Spanish Cabinet Reshuffle; New Foreign Minister Officially Assumes Office Yesterday

Buenos Aires, Argentina, 5th (Havas Agency dispatch): Oños, the head of the Spanish trade delegation, told the press here today that the cabinet reshuffle in his country was not of an abnormal nature.

After the conversation, the government issued the following communiqué: "During the conversation between the new and former Foreign Ministers, both parties cordially exchanged views, and their opinions on all matters were in agreement." It is also reported that the new Foreign Minister assumed office immediately after the conversation.

Bern, Switzerland, 5th (Havas Agency dispatch): Various newspapers are prominently displaying and commenting on the partial cabinet reshuffle in Spain. "United Press" stated that "Until now, Suñer has been the most prestigious figure in Spanish politics. In fact, because he was constantly traveling to Berlin and Rome, his international reputation even surpassed that of Head of State Franco. The reason for Suñer's resignation is not yet clear, but it is very likely that his departure is related to the recent discussions on the restoration of the Spanish monarchy. At the same time, Head of State Franco's speech on Spain's National Day on July 17 also hinted at new developments in the Spanish situation. In addition, negotiations may have taken place between the Axis powers and Spain to determine the various security measures to be taken when the second battleground opens. There are several clues that prove that this negotiation was the cause of the split in the Spanish cabinet, which ultimately led to the major accident of the current change of cabinet members."

### Public Works Department Chairman's Broadcast Elucidates the Shanghai Market Economy: Lowering the Cost of Living Has Achieved Results, Now Planning Economic Ties with Central China and Southeast Asia

According to the English-language Da Mei Evening News, Mr. Okazaki, Chairman of the Public Works Department, broadcasted on the Great Eastern Radio Station at 11:00 a.m. this morning (the 5th), summarizing the great progress that the Public Works Department has made in lowering the cost of living in this city, and finally expressing his views on the future development of Shanghai.

Prices of Various Items Have Been Lowered

His words were slightly toned down: Our efforts to adjust the economic situation here and lower the cost of living have achieved results. This is known to you all, and you must have noticed that the prices of food and daily necessities are significantly different from before. You also know that the housing problem is stabilizing, and many improper habits have been eliminated. What I should explain first is that Shanghai's economy really depends on the situation in Central China.

Economic Ties Are Planned

Therefore, although my activities are limited to this area, we have drafted an economic plan that includes Central China. We understand that in order to achieve good results, we must pay attention to the entire economic stage from production to consumption. In order to control each stage and adjust production and consumption according to the resources that can be obtained, an all-inclusive mechanism has now been established to curb the activities of illegal and profiteering elements, and the various agencies responsible for actively improving the work have contributed. The authorities have now obtained the enthusiastic cooperation of the citizens, and are gradually eradicating profiteering elements and all evils.

Shanghai's Future Will Change

Okazaki relayed Shanghai's future, saying that Shanghai will inevitably undergo major changes, including many. We are currently engaged in planning. In general, Shanghai will have a great future, because its location is suitable, and after the war it will become one of the world's largest commercial centers. In terms of industry, finance, and distribution, its importance will undoubtedly increase. At that time, great trade will pass through to the ends of the earth, and China's inland river transportation will further promote commerce.

Yesterday's newspaper publishing time was 6:30

### Public Debt: Intense Conflict Between Both Sides

Yesterday's public debt market, although fluctuating around half a yuan, the conflict between buyers and sellers was particularly intense. At the beginning of the market, buyers came out to buy, continuing the remaining momentum from the previous day, and most of them bravely absorbed the debt. Therefore, each debt continued to rise. Although the selling side tried to struggle and slightly retreat in the middle, because the demand for real goods increased, the sellers could not help but have a tail that was too big to wag in terms of chips. Therefore, buyers took the opportunity to move, and retail investors also pushed the boat along the water, resulting in the depletion of chips. Sellers were trapped by real goods buyers and had to retreat when they saw the opportunity. In short, if the chips cannot be loosened, the trend will not escape the tendency of rising easily and retreating slightly. As a result of the city's contraction, except for the Ding type, which was only a small triangle, the others rose by three or four corners. The transaction volume was about 3 million yuan. The list is as follows:

### Renewed Interest in Chinese Stocks

Yesterday's Chinese stock market situation turned from flat and tired to strong, which was actually due to the sharp decline in recent days. Since the department store industry stopped falling and rebounded the day before yesterday, it aroused the interest of new investors, who bravely absorbed it. Wing On Company returned to the 90 yuan mark and rose another 2.5 yuan. Sincere and China National Products Company both rose 2 yuan. The 30 yuan mark for underwear was broken and then returned, ending at 31 yuan, the same price as the previous day. In the cultural industry, only China Bookstore was cut by 5 yuan. Commercial Press and World Book Company rose by 5 yuan and 2.5 yuan respectively. Among the new pharmaceutical industries, Zhongfa stood out with 70 yuan and rose 2 yuan. Xinya first fell to 42.5 yuan, and then rose by 2 yuan in the buying momentum, finally rising by 1 yuan. Minyi also added 1 yuan. The public utility industry was stagnant. Xingu Fuchang Dyeing and Weaving was especially supported by buyers and rose by half a corner. Dachina Weaving and Manufacturing, Match Nan Yang Tobacco Company, etc. were all flattened. The people's hearts were firm, and although it was the weekend, the transaction volume was more than in the past. The stock price list of each stock market is recorded separately below:

### Grain Assigned by the Public

Yellow soybeans at 33.5 yuan per dan in military notes.

Raw peanuts at 44.5 yuan per dan.

Yesterday, it was reported that the Miscellaneous Grain Guild announced that the publicly assigned price of yellow soybeans was 33.5 yuan per dan in military notes, and raw peanuts were 44.5 yuan. It is not allowed to raise the price without authorization. The transaction of soybeans is still small, but due to the lack of supply, people's hearts are quite clever, and the market is rising. It is estimated that there are 20 bags of Chongming sand red, priced at 160 yuan, and more than 10 bags of Sha Lu, priced at 156 yuan.

Corn is still tending to be strong due to its sales activity. Yesterday, more than 100 bags of Wuhu corn were opened, priced at 118.5 yuan.

Sweet potato dried is rare and in great demand, and the market is quite enthusiastic. Yesterday, 30 bags of sweet potato dried from Jiangbei were opened at a price of 119 yuan, 20 bags of sweet potato dried from Qingdao at a price of 120 yuan, and more than 10 bags of burlap bags at a price of 134 yuan.

The price of red sorghum is high and sales are reduced, and it is slightly turning flat. Yesterday, a car of red sorghum from Mingguang was opened at a price of 113.5 yuan.

### Bean Thread Sticks Tight

The recent arrival of bean thread sticks is not much, and the market is still turning from flat to tight. The asking price of customers and goods has increased, and the market is gradually active. Yesterday, Panlongkou powder was 580 yuan, and Qingdao powder was 530 yuan, which was 30 to 50 yuan higher than before. The market is stable.

### Only Fifty Catties of Sea Stones Arrived

Recently, some scattered sea stones have been shipped from Shenjiamen, but the quantity is very small, only 40 to 50 catties. Because the market inventory is scarce, the trend is very clever. The customer price is 8 yuan per catty, and the market price is 10 yuan.

### Decreased Production of Hangzhou Green Hemp; Price Increases 200-Fold Since the Incident

Due to severe drought this year, the production of Hangzhou green hemp has significantly decreased, and the strands are unusually short. However, the price is extremely high, soaring from 1,000 yuan per piece to 1,500 yuan. Compared to the usual market price, and considering the conversion to the new currency at a ratio of two to one, the price increase has reached 200-fold since the incident, making it an unprecedentedly high price.

National Cigarette Market Stays Strong

The cigarette market shows signs of firmness with underlying softness. This is because the price level is high, making sellers feel constrained. Furthermore, due to the presence of moldy goods, operators are hesitant to absorb large quantities. This year, there is indeed more moldy tobacco than in previous years, caused by the activities of certain hoarding groups. Additionally, factories face water supply restrictions, leading to shorter baking times during manufacturing. The weather this year is also hotter than in previous years, resulting in widespread mold. Consequently, national brands are not as rampant as before. However, it is difficult to predict whether the hoarding trend will make a comeback as the weather changes later. Yesterday's prices remained stable, with brands like "Great Britain" at 8,100 yuan, "Old Knife" at 5,800 yuan, "Pin Hai" at 5,500 yuan, "Wuhua" at 4,500 yuan, and "Fairy" at 4,400 yuan, all slightly lower than the previous day by 50 to 100 yuan. Japanese brands like "Golden Gun" were at 2,300 yuan, "Golden Building" at 2,450 yuan, "Red Rose" at 1,580 yuan, "Quanlu" at 2,350 yuan, "Nianzhi" (moldy tobacco) at 2,300 yuan, and "Guide" at 2,000 yuan. The market sentiment is quite weak. The national cigarette market remains strong, with "Beautiful" at 3,800 yuan, "Golden Mouse" at 2,750 yuan, "White Golden Dragon" at 3,200 yuan, "Yellow Golden Dragon" at 2,400 yuan, and "Pyramid" at 4,400 yuan, continuing to rise.

Ornamental Gold Transactions Slightly Decrease

Yesterday, the gold shops in the industry association quoted 2,100 yuan per tael for ornamental gold (purchases were about 300 yuan lower). The retail price at cash shops was 2,050 yuan, and the exchange price among industry members was 1,875 yuan, the same as the previous day. Transactions slightly decreased. Ornamental silver was quoted at 14 yuan per tael, with industry exchange prices at 10 yuan and 88 jiao and 11 yuan and 2 jiao for buying and selling, respectively.

Significant Transactions in "Hailin Stick" Wool Fabric

Yesterday, the wool fabric market remained favorable, with all goods trending actively. The general market was stable, generally selling at 5 to 6 li or even 2 fen cheaper than the limited price list issued by the association and approved by the authorities. There were significant transactions in navy blue "Hailin Stick" wool fabric yesterday. Companies and shops on Mu Street, Western clothing stores, and Nanjing merchants all had considerable demand. Around 500 to 600 yards of 11 to 13 ounce fabrics from brands like Shanghai Ewo were traded. Shanghai goods were sold at 175 yuan per yard, with No. 39 priced the same as Shanghai brands, No. 55 at 200 yuan, and 6 to 7 ounce lightweight wool fabrics or imitations of "Hailin Stick" at 140 yuan.

A Brief Account of the Relief Work of Puyi Craft Workshop Under Difficult Family Circumstances

Unemployed Men and Women Vocational Training Institute
Solution for the Livelihood of the Elderly, Young, Poor, Sick, and Disaster Victims

The family is an important component of society. The more common happy and fulfilling families are, the more sound the organization of society is. This is undoubtedly true. Therefore, if we want a well-organized society, in addition to striving to build our own happy families, we must also do our best to help others create happy families.

Puyi Craft Workshop has made remarkable achievements in serving society. All those enthusiastic about social welfare undertakings should gladly support the workshop's relief work so that happy families can be widespread in society. Therefore, a general overview of the workshop's work is introduced below, hoping to attract readers' attention. (Editor)

Puyi Society is the Earliest Social Service Organization in Shanghai

The Shanghai Christian Puyi Society began in 1918 near Dadongmen in the Nanshi district, with a history of 25 years to date. At that time, it used the four aspects of education (moral, intellectual, physical, and social) as standards to serve hundreds of thousands of residents in Nanshi. Through the arduous efforts of various clergy and enthusiastic social service workers, it built a four-story reinforced concrete building on Zihulu, Dadongmen, to carry out various social undertakings. It focused on improving the lives and thoughts of ordinary people and adopted educational methods to raise cultural standards. It was known as the "Light of Nanshi."

Carrying out Charity Work to Meet Post-War Needs

Before the Nanshi Incident, the area was a flourishing Chinese district with over 300,000 residents. After August 13th, people fled to take refuge, and the area became a disaster zone. All the survivors were elderly, weak, disabled, and orphans. The Society, in the spirit of Christian salvation, established the Puyi Craft Workshop under the leadership of Qingxin Church in South Shanghai, which has been operating for five years. It handles various relief efforts, especially "work relief," to promote the spirit of self-reliance among refugees and provide them with normal vocational training to become self-sufficient. This has been most praised by society.

Replacing Begging with Work, Providing Suitable Occupations for the Disabled

The Society's refugee workshop is the core of various relief efforts. Former gymnasiums and classrooms were converted into workshops for refugee vocational training. The target beneficiaries are unemployed men and women over 40 and under 70 years old, who have difficulty finding suitable work in various factories and businesses and are considered "unserviceable wood." However, for the sake of universal salvation and enhancing human self-esteem, the Society uses discarded clothing donated by all sectors of society, finds ways to modify and manufacture them, and provides training to ensure that "everyone gives full play to their talents, and everything is used to its fullest extent." There are currently 21 male workers and over 200 female workers, with training in over 40 types of occupations, such as weaving, knitting socks, knitting towels, carpentry, bamboo work, shoemaking, sewing, and repair. The working hours are divided into morning and afternoon shifts, with each person working four hours, from 9:00 AM to 1:00 PM and from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM. Those enthusiastic about social welfare are encouraged to visit.

Reducing the Consumption Burden of Ordinary People; Providing Appropriate Microloans

The Society aims to relieve the difficulties of ordinary people in the Nanshi area due to soaring prices. The daily necessities, such as oil, salt, sauce, vinegar, and various clothing items, have become a heavy burden. Therefore, it is piloting a supply cooperative specializing in wholesaling daily necessities to provide them to the needy, with the aim of reducing consumption and achieving a balance between supply and demand. Currently, it is hiring specialized personnel and is in the trial operation phase, hoping to benefit the people. It also plans to provide microloans specifically to reward its workers. Those who have received considerable vocational training and have special skills will be given "microloans" to enable them to make a living on their own and start small-scale businesses. For example, workers who have been trained to repair shoe machines will be helped to set up their own stalls, and the vacated positions will be filled by other unemployed and impoverished refugees. Such methods of providing relief are a ray of hope in domestic relief organizations.

Supporting Childcare, Running Nurseries, Relieving School Dropouts, and Opening Free Schools

The Society also recognizes that the children of workers spend their days wandering the streets, not only wasting time but also easily falling into delinquency. Therefore, it uses the Qingxin Boys' and Girls' School buildings in Nanshi to run compulsory schools for refugees. There are currently over 1,000 students, most of whom study for free. The teachers are former workers of the Society who have been trained and promoted. Starting this semester, for the sake of saving street children, another free school has been opened at the original site of Qingxin Girls' School in Nanshi. The teachers are enthusiastic volunteer students from Qingxin Girls' School who take turns teaching, traveling long distances, enduring hardships, and going to teach regardless of wind or rain. Their enthusiasm is truly admirable. The Society also runs a nursery for workers to entrust their children, with nannies and caregivers. It is divided into two rooms: one for children who can sit and play, and one for the youngest infants. The reporter witnessed dozens of children happily laughing and playing, making it a children's paradise. There is also a free kindergarten that teaches subjects such as intelligence, games, and singing.

Reducing the Pain of Illness, Establishing Free Clinics

Nanshi has been affected by the war, making life difficult. There is insufficient nutrition on weekdays, so diseases spread quickly. The recent cholera epidemic in Shanghai originated in Nanshi. Therefore, relieving the sick and suffering people in Nanshi and providing diagnosis and medicine is also a way to alleviate the threat of infection to the residents of the concession. Hundreds of people visit the Society's clinic every day. The reporter personally witnessed the doctors and nurses of the Society working busily all day, while many people waited outside for treatment. Unfortunately, due to rising prices in recent years, the Society's finances are limited. It hopes to receive more donations of medicines or cash equivalents.

A 16-year-old refugee named Zhou suffered a bullet wound to his left foot due to the war, turning a promising young man into a cripple. For the benefit of the disabled child, the Society requested the Chinese Scientific Plastic Surgery Center to provide a free prosthesis, and he is now able to walk. The Society's efforts to benefit the disabled are significant. There are many similar examples, too numerous to mention.

Other Relief Facilities

Utilizing dozens of acres of church land to create the "Puyi Farm."

The Puyi Refugee Workshop aims to "make the best use of people's talents and materials." The left side shows blind people twisting ropes. Growing flowers and vegetables.

To sell clothing at affordable prices and products from the workshop, there is a "Refugee Shop."

To distribute rice and wheat and provide relief to the elderly and weak or those unable to work due to illness, there is a food distribution center that distributes food according to the size and needs of the family. Cash relief is also provided when necessary.

To alleviate the suffering of hundreds of children who are hungry and undernourished, the Society has a cafeteria that provides free meals to refugee children. Recently, the Red Cross has run out of rice and wheat, and it is hoped that all sectors of society will donate.

Enthusiastic People Support and All Sectors Donate Generously

To promote and continue relief efforts, the Society launched a 100,000 yuan fundraising campaign on September 1st, divided into ten teams to solicit donations from all sectors of society. Enthusiastic people have donated generously, and there are many regular supporters. A Mr. Chen, who suffered poverty from a young age and worked hard to succeed, has now opened a restaurant. He donates generously to all charitable causes. To the Society, he donates rice, dried noodles, and flour every week, as well as donating 2,000 yuan in cash to start an apprentice training program. This should awaken compatriots to assist together.

The Society's Donation Collection Office is located at Floor 2, No. 115 Yingkou Road. The Society's Office is located at No. 788 Jing'an Temple Road, Shanghai Bank, Tongfu Road, phone number 16082.

The Importance of Calcium -- Health

According to Dr. H.A. Stockadle, calcium has a significant impact on human physiology and psychology.

Calcium builds teeth and bones, strengthens arteries, strengthens the pulse, and revitalizes cells. Just as stones and rocks solidify the ground, calcium makes people have perseverance, increases concentration, and can prolong life. A lack of calcium in the human body leads to a weak will, decreased memory, disinterest in all undertakings, and susceptibility to diseases such as tuberculosis and bone disorders. Foods rich in calcium can increase capacity in the work of various physiological systems. Fifty percent of children's bone composition is calcium, increasing to 85 percent in adults. Calcium is indispensable for the new cells added in the human body, as it can combine with proteins to form a gelatinous substance and be used to manufacture or repair bones. If bones are fragile or slow to heal, it is a sign of calcium deficiency in the human body. We are well aware that calcium is very important for blood clotting. A careful doctor must first test the blood's clotting ability before removing tonsils. If the patient's blood clotting ability is found to be poor, they will be prescribed calcium to correct the defect in the blood. Many people have had bleeding that does not stop after tonsil removal, even leading to death, which shows the importance of calcium.

Five Ways to Cook Noodles -- Wang Zhicheng

Since the authorities implemented the policy of rationing food according to population, flour is often included. Each family has different ways of eating it. Here, I will list the main ways my family usually eats noodles to inform readers.

When making noodle dough, if you add beans or finely chopped toon shoots or pickled mustard greens, and add greens and dried shrimp to the soup, it tastes especially delicious when eaten at dawn.

Take an appropriate amount of flour, make it into a paste, ferment it, add eggs and butter (vegetable oil is also acceptable), bake it, wait for the dough to become smooth, knead it into small pieces, then press it thin, apply a little oil with chopsticks, add another layer, press it, and bake it with oil. It is delicious and palatable to eat.

Make the flour into a sesame seed cake shape (filled with stuffing in the middle), flatten it (the flatter the better), bake it, and then fry it. It is very suitable for both filling the stomach and relaxing.

Take some flour, make it into a paste, bake it into a large thin pancake, add salt (or sugar), roll it up, and cut it into strips to eat.

The Simple Diet of Ancient Sages -- Qiulang

News reports that rationing food according to the population allows people to purchase half a liter of white rice and half a liter of broken corn with the eighth-period joint food coupon. People may feel that it is not enough to fill their stomachs or worry that they cannot swallow the corn. However, thinking of the ancient sages, who were forced by poverty to strictly limit their diets, we, as ordinary people, and at this time of difficulty, should be able to eat even coarse grains with forbearance to get through this difficult time. Therefore, I have recorded the past deeds of the sages below:

A Basket of Rice and a Gourd of Water: The Analects say, "A basket of rice to eat, a gourd of water to drink, Hui does not change his joy. Such is the worth of Hui!" The Recovered Sage Yan Hui (Yuan) ate from a bamboo basket and drank from a gourd, without changing his honor. Therefore, Confucius decorated him even more. (Note) A bamboo basket is a bamboo container for holding rice, like a small rice bowl.

Cutting Pickled Vegetables and Drawing Soup: Xiangshan Yelu says, "Fan Zhongyan was very poor when he was young. He studied in the Longbai Mountain Monastery. He cooked millet to make porridge, which solidified overnight. He cut it into pieces with a knife and took two hunks in the morning and evening. He cut pickled vegetables to eat with it." The frugality of the wise man Fan Wenzhenggong is truly admirable! He is indeed someone that everyone today should emulate.

Twenty Letters from the Graham Family -- Translated by Xu Baiyi

The Graham Family Letters are written by Mr. Graham, who made his own fortune and built his own position, to his sons. He runs a food company, and a father who owns a business always hopes that his son can work in the business he founded. So, when Mr. Graham received a letter from his son hoping to pursue further studies after graduating from college, he expressed his opinion. Of course, what he said may be a bit biased, but in any case, it can be used as a reference for us.

Letter Three: Further Studies

Dear Son:

I received your letter saying that you are planning to enter graduate school. I object to this because I do not want you to become a professor or a poet. What you will manage in the future is the food company that I started. There are many people who seek knowledge only from books, and there are many people who find experience only from life. Neither of these two methods is the best policy. Only by experiencing what you have learned through actual work can it be applied in this company. But there is no need to seek pleasant-sounding knowledge anymore. The most important thing is practicality. And after you finish your public duties in the future, you will have plenty of time to cultivate yourself.

This place does not hire college students, except for one a few years ago. At that time, the scope of this company was much smaller. There was a staff member's son, Jem, who came here to look for a job the day after he graduated. But I did not want him to be my private secretary, so he was willing to do anything. I was still hesitant because I thought that people like him were not of much use. After a few months, he still wanted to come in and work, so I asked him to do some rough work. After three months, he hoped to change his position and increase his salary. At that time, he was a lazy person, but he could save the company money, so it was still necessary to continue hiring him. Later, he changed several positions, and he suddenly came up with many new ideas. For example, when he was asked to write publicity letters (at that time, typewriters were still in the experimental stage, so they had to be handwritten), he suggested buying a typewriter. When I asked him to promote beef juice, he suggested that I advertise. When someone went to the Arctic Ocean to explore, he sent a box of beef juice to be advertised. Such things came out one after another. As soon as he made a contribution, he asked for a raise. However, what he did was only theoretical and not suitable for reality. Therefore, the company spent a lot of unnecessary money and did not get any definite benefits. Therefore, I felt that if you want to give full play to a person's talents, he should carefully study the needs of his profession. So, speaking of your situation, you can come to serve in the company after you graduate, and in your spare time, absorb useful knowledge according to the needs of your profession, which can be more effective with less effort. This is nothing more than my personal opinion, and perhaps you do not think so. But I am finally telling you frankly what I think for your reference.

I know that you have been elected as the president of your class, which is good, because the rest of the students look up to you. At the same time, I saw that you were an athlete when you returned home for Easter, smoking a cigarette in your mouth. Neither of these two things is illegal, but my company will never hire athletic employees, and the only place where smoking is allowed is the fertilizer manufacturing room. I have a lot of trust in your thinking, so I think there is no need to say more!

Your Father, Graham

Home Economics: How to Wash Clothes -- Li

Washing clothes is not a casual matter. First, the price of soap is very expensive, and it cannot be wasted. Second, the price of clothing materials is even more expensive, so we must find ways to maintain their appearance and quality.

When washing wool and silk fabrics, the water used should not be too hot. At most, it can only be lukewarm to the touch. Otherwise, it will damage the fabric.

The time spent soaking in the water should be paid attention to. White cotton and linen fabrics should be soaked for 15 to 30 minutes. Colored fabrics should not be soaked for a long time. Ordinary soap used for washing ordinary clothes cannot be used to wash valuable fabrics. At the same time, not too many clothes can be washed at the same time. Expensive fabrics should never be rubbed heavily, and brushes should never be used.

After using soap, rinsing is essential. The number of times and its completion are determined by whether the soapy water is clear.

After purchasing the fabric, it is best to cut a small piece and test wash it with water and soap to see if it fades. You can be careful when washing it. If you have any questions, using warm water, gentle soap, and a quick and gentle treatment is the safest way.
