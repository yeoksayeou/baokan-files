### The Situation in India Remains Unstable

Milan, Italy, 19th (Havas News Agency) – A Bangkok correspondent for the Corriere della Sera recently reported that the situation in India is by no means calm. In fact, the civil disobedience movement has spread from major cities and industrial centers to the villages. This shows that Mahatma Gandhi and his staff knew they would be imprisoned and had already established a powerful secret revolutionary organization, making arrangements in advance to ensure that the organization would function as usual even in the absence of its leaders. Therefore, the situation is deteriorating day by day. British troops have been ordered not to leave the camp alone to avoid being attacked and must carry military gear at all times. Garrisons in major cities have been reinforced, and the administrative buildings of the British military and political authorities have also been heavily guarded. Twenty-two organizational newspapers of the Congress Party (including six English-language newspapers) have declared their voluntary cessation of publication. The Executive Committee of the Central United Provinces Trade Union also warned the British government a few days ago, strongly stating that the current high-pressure tactics of the British military authorities would only intensify the Indian independence movement and make the situation throughout the territory even more serious.

Lisbon, 19th (Domei News Agency) – According to a Reuters dispatch from New Delhi, the British Indian authorities announced on the 19th that about forty people have died and fifty-five have been injured in the anti-British struggle in India since the 17th.

Saigon, 19th (Domei News Agency) – A broadcast from New Delhi on the 18th stated that Gauri, the former Minister of Labor of Madras State and President of the Trade Union, has been arrested. He is a leader of the South Indian Congress Party and an influential figure in the freedom movement.

### Five Transport Ships Sunk; Public Outrage in Brazil; Military Temporarily Suspends Leave, Patrols Search for Submarines

Lisbon, 18th (Domei News Agency) – According to a dispatch from the capital of Brazil, five Brazilian steamers have been sunk by Axis submarines in Brazilian waters in the past three days, one of which was a troop transport ship. The government issued a statement on the 17th, saying that it is conducting a detailed investigation into the sinking of the Brazilian ships. Once the investigation is completed, countermeasures will be decided. The government hopes that the people will take a calm attitude so that the government can take appropriate measures.

Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, 20th (Havas News Agency) – There were more demonstrations here today to protest the sinking of Brazilian ships. The general situation is slightly more tense than yesterday, and there have been localized disturbances, but they are not serious.

London, 20th (Havas News Agency) – According to a dispatch from Rio de Janeiro, the government has ordered the military to temporarily suspend leave.

Buenos Aires, Argentina, 20th (Haitong News Agency) – Rio de Janeiro reports that, in view of the alarming and significant losses in shipping, the Brazilian government has temporarily suspended shipping off the east coast of Brazil and has ordered Brazilian ships at sea there to dock at nearby ports.

Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, 19th (Havas News Agency) – Submarines have recently appeared in Brazilian waters, and the government is now dispatching patrols to search the surrounding waters. The first step is to conduct searches near the northern coast of the country. As for rumors that the search has yielded results, they are purely fictitious and untrue. Even if there were results, they would be kept secret and not announced. All information should be based on official announcements.

London, 19th (Havas News Agency) – Reuters recently issued a message stating that two German submarines have been sunk in South American waters, and the whereabouts of another two submarines have also been discovered.

Chile Declares Protest

Santiago, Chile, 20th (Havas News Agency) – Regarding the torpedoing of five Brazilian ships, the Chilean government believes that because these ships had not received prior warnings and had no military connections, the sinking was a violation of international law. A declaration was issued to express protest, stating that such a cruel attack is contrary to the concept of international morality. The Chilean government is deeply indignant at the misfortune suffered by an American nation and should clearly express its serious protest.

Buenos Aires, Argentina, 20th (Haitong News Agency) – The Brazilian Ambassador to Argentina, Dr. Alves, went to the Argentine Foreign Ministry yesterday to ask the Foreign Minister to sign the Americas' statement condemning other countries for sinking Brazilian ships on behalf of the Argentine government.

### Repatriation Ship Asama Maru Arrives in Yokohama; Nomura and Kurusu Go to Tokyo; Nomura Details Impressions Along the Way

Tokyo, 20th (Domei News Agency) – The exchange ships Asama Maru and Conte Verde, carrying 1,421 Japanese expatriates, including Ambassadors Nomura and Kurusu, safely sailed into Yokohama this morning. Representatives from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Army, the Navy, various provinces, and newspaper reporters went to welcome them, creating a very crowded scene. A few representatives boarded the ship first to offer their condolences.

Tokyo, 20th (Domei News Agency) – Ambassadors Nomura, Kurusu, and Ishii, among others, arrived in Tokyo by car this morning from Yokohama. At 10:20 AM, they went to Nijubashi to pay their respects to the Imperial Palace from afar, and then went to the Foreign Minister's official residence.

Yokohama, 20th (Domei News Agency) – Former Ambassador to the United States, Nomura, safely arrived here on the Asama Maru today. Speaking to reporters on board the ship, he said, "I am overwhelmed with emotion to arrive safely in my home country today. This time, after leaving and returning home, I traveled 17,000 miles, taking two months. Along the way, I witnessed our army and navy break through enemy troops everywhere, displaying the spirit of Japanese bravery. When the ship docked at Singapore, I witnessed the hard work of the army and navy and was deeply impressed. Afterwards, I saw that our compatriots across the country had overcome all difficulties with a belief in certain victory, and were dedicating themselves to completing the war with an indomitable spirit, following the Emperor's war proclamation. We cannot help but be grateful. We have returned to our country on the 20th and vow to fight together with our compatriots to strive for victory. During the progress of the Greater East Asia War, we are deeply moved by the Emperor's dispatch of two extremely valuable ships to Lourenço Marques. At the same time, we express our deep gratitude for the sympathy of everyone and the multifaceted assistance of our officials at the port of call. During this exchange of expatriates, we thank the officials of Spain, Switzerland, Portugal, and Sweden for their mediation during the ship exchange in Lourenço Marques, and we are also grateful for the care of the Portuguese officials and the Italian Consul General. We also deeply appreciate the hard work of the captains and crew of the Asama Maru and Conte Verde. Although we have now returned to our country, there are still compatriots remaining in various parts of the Americas. Because the capacity of the exchange ships was limited, many compatriots were unable to evacuate on the same ship. Thinking of this, we are filled with emotion. We sincerely hope that these compatriots will love and value themselves."

### Southern Ireland Actively Strengthens National Defense; Prosperity Is Merely Superficial

Zurich, Switzerland, 19th (Havas News Agency) – The Neue Zürcher Zeitung reports from London that anyone traveling to Ireland cannot fail to notice the bright lights of Dublin and the shop windows full of butter, chocolate, and other foods, which have completely disappeared in England. However, this prosperity is merely superficial, and economic difficulties are gradually increasing. There is a coal shortage throughout the country, which has led to the shutdown of all industries, resulting in a sharp increase in unemployment. Traffic between Ireland and the United States and Britain has been almost completely cut off, not only due to a lack of ships, but because Southern Ireland has not joined forces with democratic countries in the war, and the United States and Britain are somewhat estranged from it. In Southern Ireland, there is concern that it may be drawn into the vortex of war at any time, so it is actively strengthening its armed forces and purchasing military equipment from overseas. The country now has 100,000 regular troops and 150,000 militia and air defense forces. With a population of just three million, this is no small achievement. As for military equipment, there is still a shortage, and requests for supplies from Britain and its allies have been unsuccessful. Since the United States entered the war, Southern Ireland has not participated, which the British did not expect, and they cannot help but be disappointed. The coolness in the relationship between London and Dublin is due to this. Southern Ireland has repeatedly expressed its strict adherence to neutrality and hopes that Britain will respect it, as the occupation of strategic points in Southern Ireland territory by British troops would inevitably lead to a crisis and develop into guerrilla warfare. From the British point of view, Southern Ireland's neutrality is not only a government policy, but also the position of the entire Irish people. Therefore, even the opposition parties and trade unions support the government's policy. In view of the Southern Irish authorities maintaining their original position despite the various efforts of the British government, it is clear that Southern Ireland has completely broken free from the shackles of Britain. However, it is worth noting that the Southern Irish government has not prohibited its citizens from serving in foreign armies. Therefore, there are currently about several thousand Southern Irish people serving in the British army.

### German Forces on the Eastern Front Intensify Pincer Offensive; Situation in Stalingrad Critical; Krasnodar Falls in the South

Lisbon, 20th (Domei News Agency) – After German forces south of Lizugaya crossed the Don River with their entire army, they engaged in hand-to-hand combat with the local Soviet defending forces, pushing them to retreat eastward. The overall military force is threatening Stalingrad even more fiercely. German forces northeast of Kotelnikovo have deeply penetrated the Soviet defense line in the direction of the Volga River and Stalingrad. The Soviet army is desperately resisting with tanks and infantry units. At the moment, the two armies are engaged in a battle for positions on both sides of a certain station.

Berlin, 20th (Haitong News Agency) – It was officially announced today that after the German and allied forces broke through the enemy's strong defenses south of the city of Stalingrad, the city's position is now in jeopardy.

Moscow, 20th (Domei News Agency) – The Soviet Union's communique last night admitted that the Red Army had withdrawn from Krasnodar, the capital of Kuban.

Soviet Border Area, 19th (Havas News Agency) – Today is the 423rd day of the German-Soviet War. The German High Command has been silent about the situation on the Eastern Front in recent days. According to the impression gained by neutral observers, this silence is not because the German advance has been stopped, but a sign that a decisive battle is underway. At present, it is not known what kind of changes have occurred on the Caucasus line. It is learned that the German army is engaged in mopping-up operations in the Don River bend and is still in fierce fighting. In the case of Stalingrad, the German army is still striving to advance despite the Red Army's mobilization of a large number of reinforcements. Therefore, this line is also in fierce combat. General Eremenko's forces have dug trenches on the east bank of the Don River. In addition, according to the German High Command's announcement yesterday, German aircraft successfully bombed enemy motorized units and infantry moving to the front lines.

Soviet Forces Counterattack in Voronezh; German Aircraft Fiercely Attack Ships in the Black Sea

Berlin, 19th (Havas News Agency) – The High Command has just announced that the fighting in the Voronezh area of the Eastern Front is not fierce. The Red Army's counterattack attempts in the area have come to naught. The enemy gathered a large army to attack on a narrow front, suffering heavy losses. Its ambition to break through the German army's flank was not achieved. The retreating Red Army in the Caucasus suffered heavy bombing from German aircraft. Yesterday, 19 enemy ships along the coast of the Caucasus were either sunk or damaged. Two cruisers and two destroyers north of Tuapse were also sunk. Six freighters and eight small warships were damaged in the Gulf of Temryuk, east of the Kerch Strait. In the Don River bend, the Red Army forces that were previously encircled were annihilated after their attempt to break through failed. German aircraft fiercely attacked the railway leading north from Stalingrad, shooting down 38 enemy aircraft one after another.

Berlin, 19th (Havas News Agency) – Military sources report that the Soviet Union lost 71 aircraft yesterday, 65 of which were shot down in air combat, and the rest were destroyed on the ground.

### Allied Forces Land in Northern France Complete Mission and Retreat, British Communiqué States It Was Exploratory in Nature, Both Sides Lost 177 Aircraft

Lisbon, 20th, Allied News Agency: According to last night's official announcement from London, a mixed Allied task force, after landing in the Dieppe area of northern France for nine hours, completely retreated and boarded ships according to the planned schedule. They arrived in London last night. Losses on both sides were extremely heavy. The British side estimates losses of 95 aircraft and some tanks. The German side lost a total of ten artillery positions, one ammunition depot, and one radio station. The British side has declared that this action was not an invasion, but a test for an offensive when the time is ripe in the future. It is said that this operation provided valuable experience regarding the number of troops involved in the raid, the transportation of heavy equipment, and its use in joint operations. Participants in this raid included Canadian troops, Trigo troops, and American Ranger troops.

London, 19th, Havas News Agency: It was officially announced a short while ago that British forces carried out a landing in the Dieppe area of the northern French coast. Seven hours later, all troops had returned to their original ships. Subsequently, an official communiqué stated that the soldiers who participated in this operation had all returned to their bases in England. Morale was very high during the Dieppe landing. However, our country lost 95 aircraft. As for German aircraft, 82 were shot down by our side. As a result of the battle, a total of six German land artillery batteries and one anti-aircraft artillery battery were destroyed. A military radio station was heavily damaged, and an ammunition depot was also destroyed by our aircraft.

Berlin Announces Battle Situation

Berlin, 19th, Allied News Agency: The German High Command issued a special communiqué on the night of the 19th regarding the mopping-up operation against the British forces landing in Dieppe, northern France, stating that the landing force was composed of British, American, Canadian, and Trigo troops, totaling about one division. This British-American attempt was completely crushed by the counterattack of the German defense forces. After 4:00 PM, not a single enemy soldier was visible on the European continent. The Dieppe city area is as calm as ever, and stores are open for business as usual.

Berlin, 19th, Havas News Agency: Regarding the British attack on Dieppe, northern France, the German authorities recently issued a communiqué stating that British forces attempted to land in the German-occupied Dieppe area of France yesterday but were repelled by German coastal defense forces. The British suffered heavy losses in this battle. 1,500 soldiers were captured, three British destroyers and one troop transport ship were sunk, and 83 British aircraft and 28 tanks were destroyed. The original text of the communiqué is selected and translated as follows: "At dawn yesterday, the enemy attempted to land in the Dieppe area. British, American, and Trigo troops, totaling one division, launched an offensive under the cover of naval and air forces, but to no avail and suffered heavy losses. By 4:00 PM, the British forces were forced to retreat. The German forces participating in this operation consisted entirely of local garrison troops, and no reserve troops were dispatched to reinforce them. As far as is known at present, at dawn yesterday, the British forces arrived near Dieppe harbor in three to four hundred small boats from troop transports to attempt a landing. About thirteen or fourteen cruisers and many destroyers accompanied and escorted them, and several squadrons of fighter planes provided protection to prevent the landing British troops from being bombed from the air. At the same time, a large number of troops remained at sea, waiting for the first batch of British troops to gain a bridgehead on the coast before launching a further attack. However, after landing, the British troops had no choice but to retreat to their original ships. The British also landed tanks, 26 of which were destroyed by our forces. Our forces captured a total of 1,500 British soldiers, 60 of whom were Canadians. The enemy suffered a large number of casualties. Five enemy destroyers and one troop transport ship were sunk, and two troop transport ships and one small boat were heavily damaged. The British High Command's launch of this offensive was purely for political reasons and did not consider military gains or losses, so it was destined to fail. Furthermore, the British strategy used this time was completely contrary to the basic rules of the art of war. In short, the German forces are responsible for protecting the European coast and have given the enemy an appropriate response."

First Front Line

Berlin, 20th, Haitian News Agency: German official commentary on the German High Command's announcement of the great defeat of the British and American expeditionary forces' attempted invasion of Europe states, "On July 22nd, Stalin, fearing a collapse on the southern front, had his ambassadors to Britain and the United States, Maisky and Litvinov, issue an ultimatum to London and Washington, demanding the immediate opening of a second front, limited to twelve days. New York radio stations also publicly acknowledged the Soviet demands on August 3rd. Therefore, British Prime Minister Churchill had no choice but to hastily set out, traveling via Cairo and Tehran by plane to Moscow. Accompanying him was President Roosevelt's special envoy. They arrived in Moscow on August 12th and personally explained to Stalin the difficulties of opening a second front. However, Stalin, citing the severity of the Soviet situation, refused to accept Churchill's explanation and demanded that it be opened in the shortest possible time. Therefore, Churchill had no choice but to disregard the objections of various military experts and order a large-scale landing on the French coast. Churchill sent supplemental troops, which were annihilated in a matter of hours. This was the reckless action of amateur military experts."

U.S. Aid to the Soviet Union Is Imperative

Washington, 19th, Havas News Agency

Senator Reynolds, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, recently told the press, "The landing of British and American convoys in Dieppe, northern France, is a deeply hopeful move that will lead to the opening of a second front. American bandits will participate in this second front, and troops will also be sent to aid the Soviet Union, which is currently fighting a desperate battle with the German army in the Caucasus."

### MacClerie Succeeds, British Chief of Staff in the Middle East, Auchinleck to Be Appointed to Another Important Position, Cairo Military Conference Concludes

Lisbon, 20th, Allied News Agency: According to an announcement from London, Major General MacClerie has been appointed as the British Chief of Staff in the Middle East, succeeding Major General Corbett. MacClerie is 44 years old and comes from a cavalry background. His unit was one of the first to be mechanized.

Swiss Capital, 19th, Havas News Agency

The Neue Zürcher Zeitung reports that London sources say that the British public was extremely surprised when the government announced that General Alexander would replace General Auchinleck as Commander-in-Chief of the British forces in the Middle East. Until now, the British generally attributed the defeat in Libya to General Ritchie and regarded General Auchinleck as a talented general who, at a critical moment, took over as commander of the Eighth Army and stopped the German offensive at El Alamein, earning great merit. However, the British High Command may have believed that General Auchinleck had failed to fully exploit his advantages to defeat the enemy, resulting in Alexandria still being under the threat of the Axis forces, hence the order for his dismissal. Furthermore, many British military and political circles believe that Auchinleck's new appointment will be announced soon, as he is trusted by Prime Minister Churchill and will likely be appointed to a more important position, but the time for the announcement has not yet arrived. Another report states that General Alexander's succession as Commander-in-Chief of the Middle East forces was reportedly recommended by General Wavell during the Prime Minister's recent visit to Cairo. It is reported that General Alexander participated in the Burma campaign a few months ago.

Ankara, 20th, Haitian News Agency: The important military conference held at the British military headquarters in Cairo since last Saturday concluded on Tuesday. Attendees included senior British officers from the Near East, the British Ambassador, and the American Minister. A few hours after the conclusion of the conference, the people of Cairo were deeply surprised to learn that General Auchinleck, the Supreme Commander of the British forces in the Near East, had been replaced by General Alexander. Alexander had also attended the conference in recent days. Well-informed diplomatic sources say that the change of the Supreme Commander of the British forces in the Near East had been decided as early as when Churchill visited Cairo on his way to Moscow, and Alexander's plan was sent to Moscow. The purpose of the plan is to establish a second front in the Near East, concentrating all forces to advance in the northwest directions. To the north, it could aid the isolated Soviet forces in the Caucasus, and to the west, it could fight a decisive battle with Field Marshal Rommel. According to Egyptian sources, the continuous landing of American troops in Palestine and the transportation of war materials through the Mediterranean to supply the Egyptian army are related to this.

London, 19th, Havas News Agency: The Daily Mail recently published a dispatch from its correspondent in the Turkish capital stating that Prime Minister Churchill met with officials in the Iranian capital during his recent trip from Cairo to Moscow.

### Alexander's Nephew, Sketching in the Desert, Captured

Rome, 19th, Havas News Agency: Reports state that the nephew of General Alexander, who recently replaced General Auchinleck as Commander-in-Chief of the British forces in Egypt, was also at the Egyptian front.

Prime Minister Kállay immediately rushed to report the bad news and convened an emergency cabinet meeting, deciding to order eight days of national mourning and suspend all celebrations. However, the details of Horthy's son's death in action are still unknown.

### Britain Announces Additional Naval Losses

Lisbon, 19th, Allied News Agency: London reports that the British Admiralty previously announced that in the naval battle in the western Mediterranean, German and Italian naval and air forces attacked a British and American convoy, and the aircraft carrier "Eagle" and the cruiser "Manchester" were sunk.

Berlin, 19th, Havas News Agency: This evening, a broadcast station here announced that in the past 24 hours, the Allied forces have lost a total of two warships and eleven merchant ships in the English Channel, the Atlantic Ocean, the Black Sea, and the Mediterranean Sea.

### From Lecturing to Imprisonment (3)

— Tie Ming

"The letters they received were exactly the same as mine; we couldn't report it to the police, because if we reported it to the police, our work couldn't be kept secret anymore. -- That's a dilemma, isn't it? As for the so-called Maintenance Society, Grole thought it represented a group of people in public-priced stock securities, because if there was too much gold, their securities would fall in price. Li Gan and I thought it was an organization of gold mine owners; judging from what happened later, our views were correct.

"How could our secret have been known? I still can't figure it out. I asked Grole to transport the gold we produced by car to a bank in Cette. Did someone in that bank become suspicious? Maybe Li Gan said something more to his mistress, but I don't think so.

"A week later, I received a phone call: a jumbled voice said, 'We are the Maintenance Society, if you are willing, you can set your own price and put the conditions in the advertisement column of the Petit Nimols. If you don't comply, none of you will survive! This is the final warning.' I later found out that the phone call was made from a public phone in Nimes. We all advocated ignoring it and strengthening our defenses. Everyone already had an automatic pistol, and now Li Gan has made many tear gas bombs. In addition to the burglar alarm, there were also two fierce guard dogs in the factory, so the defenses were already very tight. Moreover, they were both very enthusiastic, and I, well, I'm not afraid to die. Look, hasn't my face been messed up like this in the last European war?"

Saying this, he brushed aside his long, dirty, artist-like hair on one side, revealing that he not only had scars on his face and mouth, but also was missing his left ear.

"At that time, I was also wearing a set of dentures," he continued, "but now I've pawned them because I need to eat. I've long been disgusted with life, and old injuries often make me sore. There's not much fun in living, is there?

"At the end of the year, I had a carbuncle on my neck and was hospitalized for surgery. At this time, something went wrong: Li Gan was shot and killed at the factory gate, and two Swiss tourists said they saw Grole arguing with him for a while before killing him. The bullet in the wound matched a pistol that was dropped on the ground, and a Marseilles gun shop owner testified that he had recently sold this gun to Grole. In addition, several witnesses told a long story of fabricated lies, but put together, the fabricated story was actually very well told and seemed real, wasn't it? At about the same time, a wealthy Chilean businessman, Fernandez, sued Grole in court for borrowing six million francs from him as capital for seawater alchemy but not repaying it. He also brought a large number of forged documents. You know the court's verdict, don't you? It was determined that Grole had committed fraud and murder. Do you think a great scientist could commit such a crime? And because I knew everything about it, I volunteered to his lawyer to be a witness, but the lawyer said the matter was settled and there was little hope of reversing it. And the Maintenance Society was already making trouble for me, leaving me unable to take care of myself! One night I was ambushed by three people on the road. I had a pistol, but I didn't want to go to prison for murder, so I just threw one of the tear gas bombs that Li Gan -- that poor, wronged friend -- had made on the ground and let them cry it out. From then on, I was chased day and night, like a homeless dog! At the same time, Fernandez, as a creditor, confiscated our factory, and our records and about a kilogram of gold medium fell into his hands.

"After Grole's verdict, through his lawyer's efforts, it was discovered that Fernandez and one of the two men posing as Swiss tourists were related to a gold mining organization. So--"

At this time, our conversation suddenly stopped. I suddenly saw a bomb flying towards us from the air. Up to this moment, I really couldn't tell whether Martin's big box of stories was true or false. If it was false, then he told it so vividly and realistically, and his talent for creation and acting was also admirable, so I was ready to give him 150 francs when he opened his mouth to borrow 100 francs from me. The creation of stories should be rewarded, and 150 francs is not even a pound? Going to see dancing at Tabarin would also cost this much money, and the satisfaction I would get would definitely not be worth Martin's conversation.

But that shiny black bomb answered this question: Martin's story was true.

### Air Defense Department's Scheduled Training, Blackout Control, Begins Next Tuesday Evening and Lasts Four Hours

According to the Allied News Agency, regarding the public's understanding of all aspects of air defense, the Air Defense Command has issued detailed instructions. It is learned that the Air Defense Command has scheduled to implement training blackout control on the 25th of this month and has issued the following Notice No. 4: "It is hereby scheduled to implement "Training Blackout Control" on August 25th (Tuesday) according to the following methods.

### Bank of China and Bank of Communications to Officially Resume Operations Next Month

Central News Agency, Shanghai: Regarding the resumption of operations of the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications, the Sino-Japanese Joint Committee for Handling the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications is actively preparing based on specific guidelines. Recently, the Executive Council under the committee revised the articles of association and business regulations of the boards of directors of the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications and submitted them to the Sino-Japanese Joint Committee for approval. According to the Central News Agency's reporter's inquiry to the Joint Committee, the preparation for the resumption of operations of the two banks is quite complicated. However, in order to expedite their resumption of operations, it has been decided that the head office of the Bank of China (at the corner of Sichuan Road and Hankou Road) and the head office of the Bank of Communications (at the corner of Jing'an Temple Road and Mu'erming Road) will officially resume operations on September 1st, handling ordinary commercial banking business. As for the branch offices in this city and the branch offices throughout Central China, they will resume operations in batches depending on the situation. This is because the original addresses of the branch offices of the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications in the interior need to be rebuilt, and the original employees need to be summoned by the head office for assignment, so it is not possible to resume operations simultaneously. However, it is heard that the branch offices of the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications in the three major provincial cities of Nanjing, Suzhou, and Hangzhou will rush to resume operations in the shortest possible time.

### Strict Supervision of the Trading of Chinese Merchant Stocks, Rules Established to Prohibit Naked Short Selling

Since the implementation of measures to crack down on speculation and suppress prices, various speculative venues such as raw silk, futures, yarn, and foreign currencies have successively closed down. The prices of daily necessities have stabilized. However, the trading of Chinese merchant stocks is rampant. Investors believe that the Chinese merchant companies are profitable, so they regard them as a stable investment and repeatedly seek them out, causing prices to soar under the disparity between supply and demand. It is heard that the authorities, in order to protect Shanghai's industrial and commercial funds and stabilize the future of enterprises, have established "Provisional Rules for Cracking Down on the Shanghai Stock Market's Trading of Chinese Merchant Stocks" to strictly supervise the trading of Chinese merchant stocks. All Chinese stock transactions are limited to spot goods, and secretly buying and selling short in the name of investment is strictly prohibited.

### Water Police Corps Begins Compilation

According to the Allied News Agency, the Shanghai police corps system has been generally compiled and completed, but the water police corps organization is still lacking. The highest authorities of the Japanese Navy, in view of this, have established the Shanghai Water Police Corps Headquarters and issued Notice No. 1 on the 20th to inform the public engaged in maritime life. The notice states: "By order of the Supreme Commander of the Navy, from August 20, Showa 17 (August 20, 1942), the organization of police corps will begin for the public engaged in maritime life in the port city of Shanghai. Chinese captains (elders) or prospective captains must apply to join the water police corps organization with their related social group A by September 10. If there is no related social group, you can apply to the municipal government's water police station."

### Hair Salon Price Labels Divided into Four Grades and Eight Levels

The Barber Industry Association of this city, because the price labels of the industry in the past were unequal, now receives price approval from the Engineering Bureau and the French Public Works Bureau, etc., to show price equalization. Therefore, the association specifically notified the industry yesterday, saying: Now that the three evaluation committees of the Engineering Bureau, the French Public Works Bureau, and the Shanghai West District authorities have approved the division of industry shops into four grades and eight levels, with price labels according to level, the meeting has decided to uniformly implement them from today. All our members must follow them, and must not increase or decrease them at will, resulting in punishment. The fixed prices for ordinary haircuts, shaves, shampoos, etc. are recorded as follows: (Special) 8.7 yuan, (Associate Special) 5 yuan, (Class A) 3.6 yuan, (Associate Class A) 3.2 yuan, (Class B) 1.9 yuan, (Associate Class B) 2.5 yuan, (Class C) 2.2 yuan, (Associate Class C) 2 yuan.

### Beer Shortage Will Be Eliminated Soon, Yellow Beer Being Rushed to Production

According to the Allied News Agency, the supply of beer in Shanghai has recently been quite scarce, especially in July and August, when the weather is hot and beer consumption is at its highest. This phenomenon is expected to be eliminated in early September. It is heard that the largest and best-equipped Youpi Beer Factory in Shanghai (now managed by the Japan Beer Company) is preparing to resume supplying a large amount of yellow beer to the market to meet general consumption. According to personnel from Yihwa Beer Factory, the factory has only been manufacturing beer for special consumption recently, and only a small amount of dark beer is used to supply the market for public consumption, and there is no yellow beer. This is the reason for the recent beer shortage.

### Gordon Road Police Station Jurisdictional Area Testing Alarm Bells

At 7:00 PM last night, alarm bells were tested in the Gordon Road Police Station jurisdiction. Prior to this, the local police corps had notified residents and merchants to avoid misunderstandings.

### Overview of Fires Last Month

Last month, the Fire Brigade of the Engineering Bureau received a total of 48 alarms, including 2 malicious false alarms and 10 special alarms. The estimated value of property located within the Public Concession and the Special Land Tax Area that was lost due to fires was approximately 184,935 yuan. 5 citizens were injured in fires, 1 died due to a special cause, and 14 were injured. In addition, the brigade's ambulance was dispatched 347 times last month, transporting a total of 358 patients to various hospitals.

### Daily Necessities Will Be Officially Price Controlled, Specified Conversion Ratios, Prices Based on May 25th Prices Sold at 60% or 65% of Savings Certificates

Allied News Agency, Local News: The prices of important daily necessities sold in major department stores in the Public Concession will be greatly reduced in the short term. It is heard that the relevant authorities are now planning to stipulate the official prices of various items. The official price limit will be based on the prices of May 25th of this year, converting the old legal tender into Central Savings Certificates at a ratio of 60 or 65 yuan. The companies affected by this new measure are Wing On, Sincere, The Sun, and Whiteaway Laidlaw.

Since the Public Concession Engineering Bureau has vigorously implemented the promotion of price control, it has been quite successful. However, in the past, the most stringent price fixing only applied to foreign goods, and the goal of thoroughly suppressing Chinese merchant goods had not yet been achieved. The bureau is currently seeking to enhance the effectiveness of control and has decided to change the Price Control Section to the Price Control Office and is proceeding to adjust the control mechanism. All detailed methods will be announced and published soon. It is heard that the scope of control in the future will focus on the people's daily necessities, and the fixed prices will be strictly enforced. The fixed prices of essential goods will be in line with the standard of living.

### Plan to Establish Dozens of Hygiene Teams, Attached to Police Corps Organizations, to Promote the City's Sanitary Condition in Peacetime and Take Full Responsibility for First Aid During Air Raids

The English-language Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury reports that, according to the Allied News Agency's news today (20th), the municipal authorities are planning to establish a hygiene department attached to the police corps system in order to promote sanitary conditions through the police corps system and ensure adequate first aid for civilians during air raids. Preliminary discussions on this plan have already begun, with the participation of Chinese physicians, surgeons, dentists, and officials from the Engineering Bureau's Health Department. It is planned to establish 7 hygiene branches and approximately 35 to 40 hygiene teams.

### Xiafei Road Landlord Water Cut-off Dispute: Secret Talks of Barran; Rent Increase to Be Considered as a Solution

Mr. Barran, a French lawyer in this city (who is handling the water cut-off dispute between the landlord and tenants at Lane 1270, Nos. 11 to 15, Xiafei Road), revealed to a reporter from the *North China Daily News* yesterday that the biggest reason for the widespread rental disputes in the French Concession is the lack of proper regulations regarding the relationship between sub-landlords and sub-tenants.

Reason for Water Cut-off

Barran also stated that the police of the French Concession had notified him to restore the water supply to these five households, and declared that it was unfair for landlords and sub-landlords in the French Concession to stop supplying electricity, water, and gas. Regarding the water cut-off to the five households on Xiafei Road, the lawyer admitted that the landlord took this action because the sub-landlords of these five households, although collecting large rents from the sub-tenants, still refused the landlord's reasonable rent increase. Furthermore, he argued that the rent increase was not even enough to cover the water bill.

Order for Investigation

Barran also said that, on the other hand, if the landlord cannot collect reasonable rent from the tenants, the landlord will inevitably be unable to afford to pay the water bill, resulting in the French Water Company stopping the water supply, and the sub-tenants will still inevitably lack water supply. At this point, Barran also commented on the French authorities' order prohibiting landlords from cutting off water, saying that the above order only applies fairly to public service undertakings in the same situation. It is unfair to prohibit landlords, property company managers, and sub-landlords from stopping the water supply in general. He said that in the future, what measures will the French authorities take against sub-landlords and sub-tenants who refuse to pay rent or pay paltry rent?

Need for Mediation

He said that the reason why the difficulty has not been resolved is that there is no rent mediation mechanism and no fixed method of paying rent to prevent sub-landlords from collecting large rents from sub-tenants without being responsible for paying rent for their own homes. If the French Consulate's suggestion is implemented, then when disputes arise between the two parties, in addition to handling them in accordance with the prescribed methods, only a small part of exceptional difficulties need to be resolved. At the same time, if a rent mediation committee composed of people with economic knowledge is established, and the French authorities adjust the relationship between sub-landlords and sub-tenants, then the French Consul Magill will not need to prohibit the public from taking water cut-off actions, which can be resolved by the council.

Real Situation of Rent

The *Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury* reported that after the water was cut off from four residences at Lane 1270, Xiafei Road, due to the landlord's unsuccessful request for a rent increase, Barran, the representative of the landlord, revealed to the *Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury* reporter this morning that the four households are currently only paying 90 yuan in French currency (equivalent to 45 yuan in Central Reserve Bank notes) per month. According to his report, each of the four residences has one sub-landlord, and each house has a total of three large rooms and two medium rooms (excluding mezzanines and corridors). Therefore, the actual rent paid by the sub-landlord is less than 10 yuan in Central Reserve Bank notes per room per month. However, one of the sub-landlords in the four households collects 375 yuan in Central Reserve Bank notes per month from the sub-tenants. The landlord, with assets of 300,000 yuan in Central Reserve Bank notes, only receives 180 yuan in rent per month. At the same time, the water bill paid by the landlord is as high as 150 yuan per month. If taxes, police donations, and other unexpected expenses are added, it is fortunate if the landlord does not lose money.

Reconciliation Method

According to the lawyer, negotiations are currently underway, but the landlords still insist on paying a more appropriate rent, even though they are still collecting increasing rents from the sub-tenants. Barran's water cut-off has the same serious impact on the sub-tenants as it does on the sub-landlords, although the landlords occupy the majority in the residences. It is reported that the two parties will now reach a reconciliation, and the rent for each house will be increased to 180 yuan in Central Reserve Bank notes per month. The contract will be signed tonight. According to the French police's statement to the *Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury* reporter, the water supply to the four households will be restored this afternoon.

### Shanghai Municipal Council Collects Scrap Metal

The Shanghai Municipal Council recently issued Notice No. 6048, stating that in order to maintain the supply of all metals, it is urgent to collect scrap metal, old metal containers, damaged machinery, and other metal objects that are no longer usable, so that they can be reused. The Council has set up metal collection points at No. 150 Macgregor Road, No. 897 Suzhou Road, and No. 480 Henan Road. Those who voluntarily contribute will be commended. For large quantities of objects, please notify the Transportation Office, Office No. 39, General Office of the Council at No. 193 Hankou Road, and someone will be sent to collect them. No matter how small the quantity, it is hoped that the public will contribute as much as possible.

### Abandoned Sick Child Found in the Waiting Area of the Guangci Hospital

At the ophthalmology clinic of Guangci Hospital, when the clinic was closed at noon the day before yesterday, an abandoned female infant about two months old was found in the waiting area. It was found that she was suffering from illness. After reporting to the police, she was admitted to the hospital for treatment. However, after three days of treatment, she died due to her serious illness. The police were notified, and the body was sent to the coroner's office and buried by the charity organization.

### Extension of Closing Hours Granted to Mescon Nightclub in Western Shanghai; Other Nightclubs Also Want Extension; Investigation to Be Conducted on Eve Nightclub for Violating Rules

According to the *North China Daily News*, the public concession nightclubs in the Paramount Building on Great Western Road have extended their business hours to 11 p.m. It has been confirmed that the nightclub has obtained a notice from the Chinese authorities, waiting for them to make adjustments.

Mescon Allowed to Delay Closing

The fortunate Mescon Nightclub, because it is located at the junction of the Public Concession and Western Shanghai, has always obtained a Public Concession license like the Paramount Ballroom, and can still extend its closing hours to after 11 p.m. in accordance with the regulations of the Western Shanghai authorities. At the same time, the main entrance of the Paramount Building is closed at 11 p.m. every night, and dancers all go home through this entrance. However, visitors to Mescon Nightclub all enter and exit through the entrance of the Paramount Hotel. This entrance leads to Yuyuan Road.

Other Nightclubs to Be Considered

More than a month ago (July 10), Pan Da, the sheriff of Western Shanghai, restricted all nightclubs in the district to close before 11 p.m. He pointed out that Mescon belonged to the Public Concession. Yesterday morning, Pan Da told a *North China Daily News* reporter that he would convene the owners and managers of various nightclubs in the near future to discuss in detail the request for further extension of business hours.

Eve to Be Thoroughly Investigated

When the reporter asked whether the closing hours of various nightclubs would be allowed to be extended to 2:30 a.m., Pan Da replied that he could not make a decision at this time. After the end of this week, he will visit the Chinese authorities in order to properly resolve this matter. As for the violation of the rules by Eve Nightclub, which extended its business hours until after 12:30 a.m., Pan Da said that he will conduct an individual investigation to review whether Eve has obeyed his orders.

### Middle School Scholarship to Be Issued Today; University and Free Quota Applications Closed Yesterday; Dacheng Middle School Sets Up Half-Fee Quota to Benefit Unsuccessful Students

The list of middle school students who received scholarships from the *Shen Bao* Reader Scholarship Fund has been fully published yesterday. Payment will begin today. It is hoped that the students who have received scholarships will bring their registration certificates and personal seals to the business department of this newspaper from 10 a.m. to 12 p.m. and from 2 p.m. to 4:30 p.m. to collect the money. Students who did not receive scholarships are also requested to come to the newspaper today to collect their certificates. Applications for the university group and free places in various schools closed yesterday. All necessary procedures will be started immediately. The date of publication of the approved list for the university group will be after the 25th of this month.

Notice for Receiving Money

Scholarship checks for the middle school group will be issued starting today. Those who have been approved for applications should bring their personal seals (the original seal affixed to the application form) within one week to collect the check. Late payments will not be accepted. Students whose names have already been published in the list, if they need to change schools, please send a letter to the newspaper immediately, stating the reasons for the change and requesting the change. Otherwise, once the check has been issued, no further changes will be allowed. After receiving the check, the school should be responsible for collecting it from the bank within two weeks. It will be invalid if it expires. If there are special reasons for needing to reissue it and the newspaper agrees, the original check should be returned before it can be processed. Applicants who are unable to enroll due to other reasons should immediately return the check they received. Bring the registration certificate to collect the original documents.

Yesterday's Donations

At the previous meeting of the *Shen Bao* Reader Scholarship Fund Committee, it was decided to extend the deadline for applications for the university group to yesterday. After verification by the school that the applicants are of good character and academic standing and come from poor families, about 100 more people registered, which increased the expenditure of the scholarship fund. It is hoped that people from all walks of life will continue to provide assistance to enrich the fund. The committee is very grateful. A total of more than 1,000 yuan was received in donations yesterday, and Mr. Mao generously donated 1,000 yuan. We are deeply grateful. The amount included 1,000 yuan from the Mao residence, 50 yuan from Wu Kejing, 30 yuan from an anonymous person (account number 1582), 20 yuan from Qian Hongsui, 10 yuan from Liang Guangai, 10 yuan from Mrs. Lin, and 5 yuan from Qian Linsan, totaling 1,125 yuan in Central Reserve Bank notes. The previous balance was 180,008 yuan, 2 jiao, and 2 fen, bringing the total to 181,133 yuan, 2 jiao, and 2 fen.

Letter from Dacheng

Yesterday, we received a letter from Dacheng Middle School, which read: "Dear Sirs, We have just read the complete list of approved middle school scholarship recipients published in the *Shen Bao*. Although the number of students admitted is very large, it is inevitable that some outstanding students were missed. All of us at the school deeply admire the enthusiasm for education and assistance to the poor shown by you gentlemen at the *Shen Bao*. The founding purpose of our school is to save and educate poor students and cultivate outstanding talents. This is exactly the same as the scholarship movement of your newspaper. In addition to our gratitude, we would also like to follow your newspaper and expand relief to the best of our ability to encourage learning and do our part. In addition to the announcement in the newspaper that we will recruit 120 half-fee students on August 31, we are sending another letter to your newspaper, asking you to select 40 poor students from those who failed the exam and send them to our school. In addition to being admitted without examination, they will all be given half-fee treatment to expand relief. In terms of quotas, we will provide 10 students each in the third and second grades of senior high school, and 5 students each in the other grades of senior high school and junior high school. Half-fee students in each grade of the senior high school department will be exempted from half of the tuition fee, which is 55 yuan, and 45 yuan for junior high school. Our school will allocate 2,050 yuan from the scholarship fund to supplement these poor and needy students. Although the amount is small, we are limited in our financial resources and the number of students we can accommodate. We hope you will approve and send a letter to our school before September 3, sending these selected students to our school. We will be deeply grateful for your support. Sincerely, Private Dacheng Middle School, August 20." Note: Dacheng Middle School is located at No. 146 Hardoon Road (intersection of Jing'an Temple Road). The teaching is serious. If any of our newspaper's unsuccessful students live nearby and wish to enter the school as half-fee students, our newspaper will be happy to introduce them.

### Calligraphers and Painters Cooperate to Donate Proceeds to Scholarships

Sun Cangsou (Jing), a licentiate of the Qing Dynasty; Ji Longtu, a Jinshi; and Deng Rurong, an expert in orchid painting, are all over seventy years old and have always enjoyed calligraphy and painting. Whenever charitable organizations hold calligraphy and painting exhibitions, there are always exquisite works by the three gentlemen participating. Now, the three gentlemen, in view of the importance of scholarships, are holding a calligraphy and painting collaboration and fan painting event, and are donating 50% of the proceeds to scholarships. Samples of the three gentlemen's calligraphy and painting collaborations and fan paintings are displayed at the East Women's Bank on Hongmiao, Nanjing Road, and they will also write for customers on the spot. The minimum price for each fan is ten yuan, which is not expensive. It is heard that the three gentlemen have recently considered retiring to live in seclusion. All those who love calligraphy should not miss this good opportunity. If you hesitate, you will regret it. The event will last for three days. The collection point is Guomin Silk Company, No. 10 Taozhuli, Shilu, Er Malu.

### Price Control Office Changes Telephone Number

The telephone number of the Shanghai Municipal Council Price Control Office (including the Rice and Grain Office, the Flour Office, the Price Investigation and Enforcement Office, and the Cost Accounting Office, etc.) has now been changed to 17200.

### Poverty and Disease Spread, Poor People Fill the Streets: Poverty and Disease Relief Association Established; Wen Lanting, Pei Yunqing, and Seven Others Elected as Standing Committee Members, and Leaders from Various Industries Appointed as Fundraising Committee Members

Wen Lanting, Yuan Lvdeng, Lin Kanghou, Wu Yunzhai, and others, in view of the fact that epidemics are spreading this year, the poor are filling the streets, and various relief organizations are facing difficulties in sustaining their efforts due to lack of medicine and supplies, have initiated the organization of the Shanghai Poverty and Disease Relief Association, which is similar in nature to the previous Refugee Relief Association, but does not operate refugee shelters or refugee hospitals, and strictly adheres to the principle of providing economic and material assistance to various relief organizations. According to inquiries by a *Datong News* reporter, the association has convened meetings twice since its inception and has elected Wen Lanting, Yuan Lvdeng, Lin Kanghou, Liu Juchun, Wu Yunzhai, Xu Kouqun, and Pei Yunqing as standing committee members. The standing committee members have mutually elected Wen Lanting as the chairman of the committee, and Yuan Lvdeng and Lin Kanghou as the vice-chairmen. Yan Fang, Pan Yangyao, Ding Houqing, Guo Shun, and Wang Shuxian were elected as supervisory committee members. Four subgroups were set up under the committee, namely, the Fund Management Group, the Fundraising Design Group, and the Audit Group. The association's charter and history have been sent to the printer. The association has been largely organized and established and has sent letters to leaders from various industries to serve as fundraising committee members. The appointment letters are being drafted and will be sent out. After the meeting next week, the fundraising campaign can be launched.

### Beware of Malaria and Dysentery

Since the authorities in this city have adopted strict epidemic prevention measures, the spread of cholera has been slightly alleviated, but it has not yet been eradicated. In recent days, the autumn sun has been rampant, and malaria and dysentery have risen again. Citizens are urged to pay attention to hygiene. Those who have not been vaccinated against epidemics should be vaccinated immediately to avoid infection. It was recently learned from the Shanghai Epidemic Hospital at No. 25 Yu Qiaqing Road that as of midnight on the 19th, the hospital had 166 inpatients. In addition to 5 people suffering from dysentery and 5 people suffering from other diseases, the rest were suffering from epidemic diseases. Among them, 78 people have been confirmed to have true cholera, which shows that cholera has not been eradicated. The number of outpatients at the hospital is still extremely crowded.

Three Million People Have Been Vaccinated

It is heard that in the past few days, the number of people vaccinated against epidemics in the Public Concession and the French Concession has decreased significantly.

### Rice Shop Measuring Instruments Inaccurate; Strict Investigation of the Cause; Shop Owner Temporarily Released on Bail, Summons to the Chairman of the Guild

The Xietai Rice Shop at No. 66 Dagu Road, opened by Fujianese Fang Xiangyun, was found to have three scales and one rice measuring instrument with inaccurate weights when Inspector Finantes, a Western inspector from the Weights and Measures Office of the Shanghai Municipal Council, and a Japanese inspector went to investigate at 3:40 p.m. on the 11th of this month. They were all taken to the police station, and Fang Xiangyun was charged. Fang Xiangyun was summoned yesterday. The police stated everything. Fang Xiangyun claimed that all the scales had been put aside and were not in use, and that the rice measuring instrument was allocated by the Rice Industry Guild and was not self-provided, so he did not know whether it was accurate or not. Since inaccurate instruments are related to the public's food supply, it is necessary to conduct a strict investigation. Fang Xiangyun was ordered to pay 6,000 yuan bail. The case was adjourned, and the chairman of the Rice Industry Guild, Lu Wenshao, was summoned to appear in court for further verification.

### Learning by Choice vs. Forced Study

— Kuangcheng

Some years ago, I remember a scholar giving a lecture on the question of learning at a middle school in Guangdong. He divided those who pursue learning into two categories: those who do not wish to, regarding learning as a painful chore, and those who do, those who love knowledge, like some people love playing cards or smoking.

Many educators have studied diligently and have been unable to answer the question: "Why do so many students have particularly poor grades?" But based on that speaker's speech, we can definitively say, "Their grades are poor simply because their learning is 'passive'."

There are many things in the world where success or failure depends entirely on being "automatic" or "passive." The way of learning is the same. Just look at the average students in society today and you will know.

Most of those who enter the school gates can be said to have come in obedience to their parents' orders. Students who are more aware of the situation believe that to find a job and make a living in the future, they must study, so they are driven by a kind of force and have no choice but to enter school. As for those who are more muddleheaded, many are forced by their parents to enter school to fulfill their duties as children. In short, they have no interest in learning, because they are fundamentally reading passively.

Passive learners, once in school, must also be "forced" by teachers to hold books and study. If there were no grades, passing, credits, make-up exams… a whole host of terms to threaten students, perhaps some would treat school as an entertainment venue.

I once heard a teacher say, "Those who teach can be called craftsmen, but not teachers, because they must have a skill to stuff 'knowledge' into the students' brains, and then use hooks to pull the 'knowledge' out at the time of the exam, otherwise it is impossible to 'manufacture' students."

Generally, passive learners, although they listen to lectures, take notes, and study in school, are afraid of "losing face" because of poor grades, being blamed by the teacher, or being held back... They find knowledge bland and tasteless.

Learning in this way, semester after semester, the results, although not completely ignorant, will be half-knowledge, seemingly understood but not understood, because they originally had no interest in reading, and the books they are forced to read will naturally not leave a deep impression on them.

In the scholarship screening exam held by this newspaper, applicants answered that the theory of relativity was invented by Roosevelt, and the theory of Huaihua was created by Xu Guangqi. Some may say: "Have these students read any books at all?" I can say, "They have read books, but not automatically, so they have no deep memory of everything in the books."

This is the result of passive learning. Perhaps they are applying for scholarships passively as well!

We should "learn automatically"!

### Sharing the Same Boat in Storms

— He Jiazi

(8) What can be done

Second Mrs. Ye and Weicheng, one had just spoken, and the other already understood clearly. Second Mrs. Ye lowered her head and thought for a while, as if she saw Cuizhen dressed neatly and becoming Ye's daughter-in-law, and smiled: "After going around in a big circle, it still goes back to the original position." Weicheng also smiled and said, "I originally regarded Sister Cuizhen as my own sister, and had no intention of talking about marriage. Now, I am forced to do this by the environment, so I have to do this. But sitting in Zhang Shurong's boat, I thought of two worries, Auntie, listen to me." Second Mrs. Ye had a smile on her face and said, "Young people can't be like old people, thinking this and thinking that. What are you worried about? I know, the worries you're talking about are things that others wouldn't worry about. Weicheng said, "One worry is a lesson from the past. Just look at my feelings with Guofang. I thought that Guofang and I were a sure thing. As long as we maintained our friendship, one day, if I didn't ask Guofang, maybe Guofang would ask me. Who knew that when I asked, I was rejected. What if Sister Cuizhen also rejects me? Another worry is the concern for the future. Sister Cuizhen also has an uncle, and her uncle is the closest relative in front of her. If there's no problem with Sister Cuizhen, wouldn't Fei Changhe cause problems?" Second Mrs. Ye laughed and said: "I said earlier, others don't need to worry about it. In these years, I have seen Cuizhen's thoughts. As for her uncle Fei Changhe, although he is an unreasonable gambler, he is still a person, and a person still has some conscience. How we treat him, we don't need to say, we can let him say it himself. Weicheng, let's talk about it tomorrow." Weicheng smiled and said, "I really want to talk about it tomorrow. Isn't tomorrow too early?" Second Mrs. Ye said: "Not early, not early. Tomorrow, I'll ask Cuizhen first. We've decided that we can hold the wedding after your mother's anniversary next year." Weicheng thought of losing in the east but gaining in the west, and happily went out. He reopened the door, and had one foot out, but unexpectedly, as he was going out, Second Mrs. Ye, sitting on the bed, heard Weicheng ask "Who", followed by a burst of messy footsteps, which made Second Mrs. Ye's hair stand on end.

### Politeness

— Ai Shi

Recently, Berlin and Tokyo have successively launched politeness campaigns, and China's New Life Movement also lists politeness as the first of the four virtues. The importance that various countries at home and abroad attach to politeness can be seen from this.

Politeness seems to be of little importance, but it is an indispensable quality in dealing with people. Here, we don't want to promote red tape, and we don't expect people to bow to us at ninety degrees. What we mean is: as long as we can pay a little attention in our daily life and behavior, bring a bit of harmony and humility, and say a few words that make people happy, (these are the essence of "politeness," that is, what the Analects call "politeness in use, harmony is precious.") then our social life will be more harmonious and vibrant, and many misunderstandings, conflicts, and even hatreds and disputes and other unfortunate phenomena can also be eliminated as a result.

The American Telephone Company has published large advertisements in magazines and newspapers, asking people from all walks of life to "remember to say 'please' to our telephone operators when reporting telephone numbers." Indeed, some ordinary words such as "please," "thank you," "sorry," "trouble," etc., take no effort to say, but they have great benefits. For example, if you ask someone for help, if you say a few more thank yous, sorrys, etc., the other party, even if unwilling, will have to reluctantly agree.

In recent years, Shanghai has been in a special situation, and commerce in all aspects has deviated from the norm. Not to mention anything else, just take the retail business, because prices are rising every day, bosses do not want to rush to sell goods, so they do not care about whether there is a transaction, so some shop assistants easily ignore the politeness they should have, and often show arrogant attitudes to customers. This really damages commercial morality, but on the other hand, customers often have what Shanghai people call "old three old four" airs, which makes it difficult for people, and is also not right.

In many places in the United States, ticket sellers on cars often stand at the car door to support passengers, especially the elderly and weak, and every move is done with a courteous attitude. In this way, there is little possibility of conflict between passengers and ticket sellers.

In summary, people are social animals, and human life is mutual aid. We have to contact people every day, and we cannot do without the art of getting along with people. Politeness is the first lesson in the art of getting along with people.

### Reading Han Yu's Biography

— Jingyuan

Recently, I read Han Yu's biography written by Meng Jian, a senior official of the Tang Dynasty, which contains the metaphor of Shun's dog and a concubine. The article says: "Once Shun raised a dog, and the dog only saw Shun day and night. One day, Yao passed by his residence, and the dog barked at him, not because it loved Shun's virtue and hated Yao, but because it had only seen Shun and had never seen Yao." It also says: "I also heard that when a woman gets married, her mother sends her off and says: Go to your husband's house, be respectful and careful, and do not disobey your husband. Then following people is the matter of a concubine." After reading the biography, I checked the Summary of the Complete Library in Four Sections, which calls the biography dubious, but as a scholar's habit, I still remembered the upright situation when Changli originally argued against welcoming the Buddha's bones.

When Chaozhou's Lingshan Datian Monk criticized Changli, who was then demoted to Chaozhou, for welcoming the Buddha's bones as Shun's dog and a concubine, if it was indeed the case, it seemed that the criticism was too harsh. Changli had also been praised as "a commoner who became a teacher for a hundred generations, and a word that became a law for the world." Li Bai also said, "I don't need to be granted the title of Marquis of Ten Thousand Households in life, but I only wish to know Han Jingzhou," and "His works are like the actions of gods and his virtue moves heaven and earth." Then, although his articles and morals were not worthy of Shun, why should he be compared to Shun's dog? Changli, as a Yuanhe Penal Department attendant, still dared to submit a memorial to object to the emperor's welcoming of the Buddha's bones. Views may differ, but it was not the behavior of a concubine following others. Moreover, at that time, criticizing the monarch was a great crime. Pei Du and Cui Qun said, when the monarch intended to punish Changli, "If he did not harbor the utmost loyalty, how could he do this!" This was a fair comment. However, Changli was eventually demoted to Chaozhou to write his essay on sacrificing to crocodiles. Later, he moved to Yuanzhou, which was still a time when Changli's old age was returning to sweetness. When we read the official history, we admire Changli as a person, but unexpectedly, when I was in my thirties, reading the biography, it stirred up my feelings about Changli's life experiences as a scholar who did not fit in with the times. At the same time, I think that Changli's dedication to Confucianism and his straightforwardness are still lovely. As for the argument against welcoming the Buddha's bones, I dare not speak rashly about right and wrong. "What is Shun, what am I?" I dare not rashly compare myself to Shun, let alone act like Shun's dog.

Finally, I think it is not surprising that Shun's dog does not know Yao, because Yao does not need to compete for Shun's favor. If Shun's dog does not bark at Yao, then there will inevitably be a feeling that Yao is not as good as Shun. In other words, if Yao raised a dog, it would also bark at Shun; Furthermore, if Jie and Zhou had dogs, because Yao and Shun were not related to Jie and Zhou, and Jie and Zhou did not know Yao and Shun, then the dogs of Jie and Zhou would naturally never know Yao and Shun. As for the saying of concubine, in ancient times, following her husband was considered a woman's virtue. Now, if we are in love with each other, we will form a good marriage. If our opinions are not in agreement, it will be difficult to grow old together. We can only announce a divorce. The iron law of forcing women to obey has been broken. This is an ancient and different situation, and it is also my feeling about these two metaphors after reading Han Yu's biography. I feel that some things are not in line with the present, and are not entirely appropriate.
