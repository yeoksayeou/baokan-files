### Japanese Air Force Continues Bombing Corregidor; Battles on the Bataan Peninsula

Washington, 28th (Reuters) – According to an announcement from the Department of the Army, multiple Japanese bombers conducted a seventh consecutive day of bombing on the fortress of Corregidor Island in Manila Bay yesterday. On the 26th of this month, the island was continuously bombed from morning until afternoon. Only intense skirmishes occurred on the Bataan Peninsula.

Tokyo, 28th (Haitong News Agency) – Following over a month of fighting, land operations have temporarily ceased, and the work of clearing occupied areas has begun. Japan's battle lines in Asia are approximately as follows: extending south directly to Malaya and Singapore. The reorganization work of Japanese forces in this area has been progressing smoothly. After the Japanese landed in the Andaman Islands, they added another layer of protection to the Malayan coast. Java has been occupied by Japanese forces in a short period. Dutch forces in the interior of Sumatra are still resisting, but this is insufficient to affect Japan's position. With the exception of the British-held portion, Borneo has been completely occupied by Japanese forces. Within the Dutch-held portion, there are occasional local battles, which are also insignificant. Dutch New Guinea has not yet been occupied by Japanese forces, but in the Australian-administered portion, Japanese forces have occupied New Ireland and New Britain, as well as the seaports of Madang, Salamaua, and Lae. They recently occupied Buka Island in the Solomon Islands. American and Philippine forces on the Bataan Peninsula in the Philippines are still resisting fiercely, taking advantage of the terrain. The Japanese authorities are avoiding unnecessary bloodshed and plan to wait until their food supplies are exhausted, forcing them to surrender voluntarily. American forces remain on Corregidor Island but have long been completely isolated from the outside world. All military key points in other parts of the Philippines have been occupied by Japanese forces. Although there are still remnants of enemy troops in the interior, they will soon be resolved automatically.

### U.S. Eliminates Priority Treatment for Gold and Silver Mining Industries

Washington, 27th (Havas) – According to an announcement from the War Production Board, gold and silver mining industries do not significantly contribute to the war effort. These industries will no longer receive preferential treatment. Traditionally, encouraging the extraction of domestic gold and silver and even assisting neighboring countries in these mining industries has been a U.S. policy. The War Production Board's elimination of their priority status will likely create a crisis for the gold and silver industries in the U.S. and its neighboring countries. At the same time, gold and silver industry centers from the foothills of Los Angeles to Canada and Mexico will experience great difficulty due to the lack of necessary machinery. This machinery has been manufactured in American factories, but under the current circumstances, it will be difficult to continue manufacturing it in the future.

### A Pilgrimage to the Indian Peninsula (6)

A Tour of Assam

We also encountered trouble in Benares. The city is full of crawling snakes and a listless, drowsy state cobra. Lorre wanted to put the cobra and a mongoose (which enjoys eating snake eggs and is often raised in India to eliminate snakes) together to watch them fight. He spent a week of time and considerable expense to capture a large cobra, six feet long, as thick as a wrist, and as black as the midnight sky. He used wire to form a fence eight feet in diameter, surrounded by branches and leaves, so that the camera would not see it. Of course, the snake would not see it either. It raised its head and saw the mongoose, and immediately darted through the wire mesh as if there were no fence, straight towards the camera! Equipment worth several thousand dollars was destroyed as a result, without any theory.

Later, we religiously modified this fence to prevent the snake from escaping, but putting the two opposing animals into the enclosure was very disappointing. They did not fight; not even a small fight at the beginning. After only a short while, the cobra was already dying, bitten to a state of near death. The snake's head was seized by its angry enemy, who pierced it with merciless claws.

We planned to hunt for a week in Assam, north of Calcutta, on the border with Bhutan. We left our equipment in Benares and took the night express to Calcutta, where we met Peron, a professional hunter from that area.

After another night train ride, we arrived at a small village in the north. Then we drove north by car for forty miles to an Assam tea plantation. Two oxcarts and two hunting elephants were waiting for us. The former was used to transport equipment, and the latter was for us to ride. We travelled another twenty-eight miles to reach our destination. The oxcarts rattled and gradually fell behind.

We travelled along a stream, whose waters were flowing and murmuring, all meltwater flowing down from the peaks of the Himalayas. The mountains here are the natural boundary between British Assam and the Kingdom of Bhutan. Tiger footprints could be seen everywhere in the sand, indicating that they came out of the woods on that side to drink water on this side.

It was afternoon, and we had been riding on the elephant's back for a long time, twisting our lower backs and tiring our bodies. Finally, we found a place to set up camp, to be our temporary home for the next fourteen days. The tents were pitched on the riverbank, with undulating hills in the back, towering over the world-famous high mountain range.

Hunting was conducted in two ways. The first method was to tie up a live cow as bait for tigers and then sit on a treetop waiting for the tiger to return to eat the cow. The other method was to sit on the back of an elephant and search and shoot bison, deer, wild elephants, or the rarely seen Indian rhinoceros. We tried both methods - the latter for daytime hunting, and the former for catching tigers at night.

The area we hunted covered approximately fifteen to twenty miles around. The elephants walked through the terrible jungle like tanks, which was very reassuring. And they were often concerned for the passengers riding on their backs. The elephants did not pay much attention to the plants they wanted to eat, and they were always mindful of any inverted branches or vines. If there was anything like that obstructing the passengers on their backs, they would use their incredibly powerful trunks to grab the obstructing plants and bring the branches down. If a tree in the way was too big to uproot, the elephant would ram it down with its head.

One day we walked along the river to the Bhutan border. Lorre and Powell walked slightly ahead. About seventy-five yards ahead of us, we saw a wild elephant with very beautiful tusks. Elephants have poor eyesight, and it did not see us. We were fortunate to be downwind and stopped immediately.

"What do you plan to do?" Peron asked Lorre. Lorre thought about it with some resentment. Of course, we knew that elephant hunting was always done on foot, not while riding an elephant. The wild elephant was facing us, and the shooting distance was too far to hit its head directly. Because there was no way to shoot, Lorre thought he could only give it up and retreat silently.

We returned to the tents to prepare for dinner, only to see that there were many people and horses around. It was the time of year for the Bhutanese to travel, running from this village to the Assam plains to do business.

A Bhutanese soldier gave us two gifts - beautifully embroidered pouches. We had not prepared such social items, so we were almost at a loss to reciprocate their gifts. We could only give Berger's scarf and cigarettes. The Bhutanese were short in stature and dignified in appearance. Each person carried a rifle, and some also wore a sword.

### Britain Will Not Change Its Policy Towards India; Plan to Be Announced Tomorrow Morning; Cripps Meets Gandhi Again

New Delhi, March 28th (Reuters) – The Lord Privy Seal and Special Envoy to India, Cripps, met with reporters this morning and spoke about yesterday's meeting with Gandhi. He stated, "I am completely satisfied with this meeting, and I hope to meet with Gandhi again. The discussions yesterday were limited to climate, food, hygiene, and other such matters." He added that the outcome of the talks did not alter the plan he brought in the slightest. Only one sentence was revised in wording due to its unclear meaning. He explained that he would stay in India for two weeks, keeping the original plan unchanged. He said, "I must know whether the plan is acceptable before leaving India, but that does not mean I will stay indefinitely. Within ten days, I will decide whether the plan can be accepted." He revealed that the content of the plan would be announced on Monday morning. This morning, Cripps met with representatives of Indian princes and will hold talks with the Governor of Punjab.

New Delhi, March 28th (Reuters) – After a particularly extended meeting today with Gandhi, Congress President Acharya, and other Congress leaders remaining in New Delhi, Cripps met this afternoon at his residence with the former Governor of Madras, Rajagopalachari, for eighty minutes. Afterwards, Cripps also met with Liberal Party leader Sapru and independent member Jayakar.

New Delhi, March 28th (Reuters) – Today, the leader of the All-India Muslim League, Jinnah, met with Cripps for about an hour. Cripps indicated to reporters today that he would speak with Indian Communist Party members. The Communist Party is banned in India, but Cripps stated that he did not intend to meet with the party's representatives but hoped to speak with individuals and expressed a particular desire to meet with representatives of women and youth. He also said that the British plan for India is scheduled to be announced in India at 6 PM Indian Standard Time on Sunday, and at 8:30 AM on Monday morning, the contents of the plan will be broadcast to the Indian public with explanations. Cripps said his father meets with the Viceroy every night to inform him of the day's events.

New Delhi, March 27th (Havas) – According to well-informed sources here, Sir Stafford Cripps, the British Special Envoy to India, has brought a plan that advocates granting India the legal status of a "Federal Dominion." Each province and state would be free to decide whether to join the federation or remain outside the federation as a separate entity but still part of the dominion.

Stockholm, March 28th (Reuter) – A London dispatch reports that the final ultimatum on which Cripps is conducting negotiations in India will be announced today to dispel various rumors and to call on the leaders of Indian parties unwilling to compromise with Britain to reach an understanding with Britain.

Gandhi Refuses to Comment, Concentrating Intently on Important Matters

New Delhi, March 28th (Reuters) – After meeting with British Special Envoy Cripps yesterday, Gandhi, seeing a crowd of reporters, said, "Look at these liars." After pausing for a moment, he turned to Cripps and said, "I know you like these people very much." Cripps replied, "You like these people even more." Gandhi then answered a reporter, "I have vowed to remain silent." The reporter asked, "Have you not spoken out against the war?" Gandhi still answered with a vow of silence. The reporter pressed, "Have you taken a vow of silence in an instant, or is this a well-planned scheme?" Cripps then said to the reporter, "You are a naughty boy." Later, it was learned from those around Gandhi that Gandhi was imitating the silent people this time, not intentionally avoiding reporters' questions, but simply wanting to maintain a certain silence to concentrate intently on important matters. This is only a recent event, distinct from his lifelong habit of being silent one day each week. His recent attitude of silence is also not strictly adhered to, and he will not hesitate to speak when important matters require it.

New Delhi, March 28th (Reuters) – After Gandhi arrived here, National Congress President Acharya had a long confidential discussion with him.

Allahabad, India, March 28th (Havas) – Nehru, President of the Indian National Congress, stated that the members of the Congress requested that a temporary meeting of the Standing Committee be convened in New Delhi on the 31st. It is reported that the Vice President of the Congress, Sitaramayya, has already prepared a lengthy memorandum outlining the Congress's views to be submitted to Sir Stafford Cripps.

New Delhi, March 27th (Havas) – The Executive Committee of the Muslim League decided today to ask its leader, Jinnah, to meet with the Lord Privy Seal, Sir Stafford Cripps, again. Sikh representatives are preparing to submit the proposals put forward by Cripps to the Executive Committee of the Sikh community for discussion. Cripps is scheduled to receive reporters tomorrow. The appointment to meet with the Prime Minister of Punjab, Sir Sikander Hyat Khan, tomorrow has been postponed. Also, the All-India Hindu Conference has appointed two representatives to call on Cripps tomorrow to discuss various issues related to the conference.

New Delhi, March 28th (Reuters) – Cripps is scheduled to meet with Gandhi and Nehru again tomorrow (Sunday).

### Bose Appointed Leader of Indian League; Open Letter to Cripps

Berlin, March 28th (Reuter) – Bose, the leader of the Indian National Party, recently sent an open letter to Cripps stating, "India has no enemies outside its borders; India's only enemy is British imperialism." The contents of the letter were broadcast last night by an anonymous radio station. Bose expressed surprise at Cripps' acceptance of Churchill's order to go to India, as Churchill is the most opposed Englishman to India. The British government has promised India only dominion status after the war, not independence. You recently stated in New Delhi that your views on India are no different from Churchill's. We deeply appreciate your frankness. Are you aware that the history of British rule in India is one of constant broken contracts and unfulfilled promises? Knowing that the Indian Congress is demanding complete independence, it is an insult to India that you have come from afar to India to offer such conditions to India. Bose continued, stating that if India does not participate in the war on the British side, no nation of the Tripartite Pact would want to attack India. Britain's declaration of India as a belligerent nation violates the will of the Indian people. If your sympathy for the Indian people is so slight, and you want to impose the terrors of modern warfare on the Indian people, we can only ask you to move the British military bases in India and stop using India as a sacrifice for your imperialist war. When the British army retreats from India and sets fire to cities and villages, the victims will be the pitiful Indian people. Japanese Prime Minister Tojo has clearly stated that the Japanese government's policy is for an independent India. I hereby appeal to you and your government to accept the Japanese government's approach, which is "India for the Indians." In other words, all British people should immediately withdraw from India. This can be an effective measure of your sincerity. The Indian people all know that this war is to overthrow the old order and to realize the opportunity for independence that the Indian people have been pursuing for many years. All who wish to help India achieve freedom are India's friends and allies."

Bangkok, March 28th (Reuter) – It was announced in Bangkok last night that during a meeting of leaders of the Indian independence movement, Bose, the leader of the Indian National Party, was elected as the supreme leader of the Indian Independence League and the Free India Army. Hariharnath, the leader of the Indian independence movement in Japan, was appointed as the deputy leader. The meeting was held in Singapore on March 9th, attended by Pridi Nosyaratana, Chairman of the Indian Independence League of Thailand, Maha Singh, Commander of the Free India Army, and Phraya Phaholphonphayuhasena, Chairman of the Indian National Committee of Thailand. Representatives of the Indian Independence League and the Indian National Committee of Bangkok proposed the election of Bose as the supreme leader of Indians in East Asia and the Indian freedom movement. The Indian people living in Thailand have expressed allegiance to Bose. A conference of East Asian Indian leaders was scheduled to be held in Tokyo on February 28th and 29th, but several leaders were absent due to a plane crash.

### Reselling Returned Hometown Certificates for Profit: Strict Action Urgently Needed; Evacuation Association Notifies All Native Place Associations to Pay Attention; Applications for Half-Price Tickets Must Be Made in Person

The Intelligence Office of the Shanghai Municipal Council announced that the Chinese Evacuation Committee of the Bureau has received reports that unscrupulous individuals have obtained half-price travel tickets from various visa offices and are reselling these half-price tickets to others, profiting from them. This situation is obstructing the evacuation work and should be strictly prohibited. Therefore, all native place associations are notified to pay close attention and earnestly inform their fellow natives that in the future, applications for passes and half-price tickets must be requested and issued by the applicants themselves, and others are not allowed to collect them on their behalf. After obtaining the passes and half-price tickets, they should go to purchase tickets in person and must not transfer or sell them to prevent abuses and benefit the evacuation. If the above-mentioned malpractices are discovered again, strict action will be taken to rectify the situation.

### After the Evacuation of Refugee Shelters, the Fate of Orphans, Widows, and the Disabled Remains to Be Addressed; Refugee Associations Have Consulted with the Concession Authorities and Will Centralize the Takeover to Continue Maintaining Their Sustenance

Although the refugee problem in Shanghai has come to an end with the evacuation announcement, the total number of orphans, widows, the elderly, and the disabled is still over one thousand. Their sustenance and care will be a costly affair. A summary of the situation is as follows:

Process of Evacuating Refugees: Among the refugee shelters in Shanghai, those directly managed by the Refugee Relief Association are the No. 1 Shelter on Dunxin Road, those managed by the Cili Union are the Ciyuan Shelter on North Zhejiang Road, and those jointly managed by the Cili Union branch are the Elderly and Weak Shelter on Route Dufour and the Disabled Shelter at the Temple of the Queen of Heaven. Their sustenance is uniformly provided by the Refugee Relief Association.

Orphans and Widows Cannot Be Evacuated: Since the evacuation of refugees began, it was completely completed by the 23rd of this month. However, the Dunxin Road Shelter still has about six or seven hundred elderly, weak, orphaned, widowed, and disabled refugees remaining, who are temporarily being sustained by the Refugee Relief Association. The North Zhejiang Road Shelter has 200 orphans remaining. Apart from those being sustained by the Jisheng Society, efforts are still being made to maintain the sustenance of child refugees and a small number of elderly and weak individuals.

Aftercare Is Being Negotiated: On the Cili Union branch side, several hundred disabled and elderly refugees who cannot be evacuated also remain, totaling over 1,000 people. The disposal of these refugees who cannot be evacuated is currently being negotiated between the Shanghai Municipal Council and various shelter organizations. After the refugees are centralized in one place, it is hoped that the Municipal Council will take over and maintain their sustenance so that these refugees who have no hometown to return to can have food and lodging. It is expected that a decision will be made on this matter within a few days.

Association Appeals Again for Donations: The Shanghai Refugee Relief Association yesterday issued another appeal for donations, stating, "Regarding the fact that although the refugees in the shelters sustained by this association are being successively given funds and evacuated, there are still many people to date. At a time when prices are soaring and food is scarce, there is a real fear that it will be difficult to continue. The association's reserves are about to run out, and the evacuation costs to be paid are substantial, requiring urgent funding. Therefore, we are issuing a special notice, urging all benevolent people from all walks of life and all businesses to maintain the enthusiasm for disaster relief that they have shown in the past, so as to ensure the fulfillment of the initial intention from beginning to end, and to actively donate so that the association can complete the aftercare. We are extremely grateful for this notice."

### Food Company Owner Accuses Younger Brother of Embezzlement

Guandongheng Canned Food Company, located at 122 Yunnan Road, is exclusively owned by Wei Chi Baoqing (36 years old from Nanjing). His younger brother, Wei Chi Zhaojia (24 years old), serves as the general manager. Wei Chi Zhaojia resides at Room 3, 121 Route Ratard in the French Concession. He was recently reported to the French police by his elder brother, Wei Chi Baoqing, who stated that his younger brother, Wei Chi Zhaojia, went privately to 134 Lane at the intersection of Avenue Sainte Marie and Avenue Joffre at 9 AM on the 21st of this month, pried open the iron lock on the warehouse door, entered, and stole 350 cases of canned food worth more than 30,000 yuan, transported them out, and sold them to Kaiyuan Canned Food Company at No. 1, Shen Yuli, 117 Route Pére Robert, using the proceeds for wild gambling and extravagant spending. However, these goods should be worth as much as 50,000 to 60,000 yuan at the current market price. He requested that the case be investigated strictly. The police chief granted the request and dispatched detectives to arrest Wei Chi Zhaojia the other day, along with the owner of the Kaiyuan Canned Food Company, who bought the stolen goods. According to Wei Chi Zhaojia's confession, he went to the warehouse to pick up goods for sale because the store needed funds and had obtained the consent of his elder brother, not acting privately to steal. The police chief ordered him to be detained pending investigation and verification.

### German Doctors Host Medical Lectures - Held at Baolong Hospital - Scheduled to Begin April 2nd

Several German doctors in this city recently planned to hold medical lectures, scheduled to be delivered in German, so that Chinese doctors in Shanghai can attend, and thus become familiar with important scientific knowledge and experience in all aspects of medical research. These lectures will be held in the clinical lecture hall of Baolong Hospital. The first lecture is scheduled to begin on April 2nd, and thereafter will be held every Friday, from 6:00 PM to 7:00 PM. The German doctors also issued a joint declaration, stating briefly that, currently, the flames of war are raging around the world, and all mankind is moving towards new goals. Once the war ends, the responsibilities of doctors will be arduous. If they wish to shoulder this heavy responsibility in the future, they must prepare in advance, pay attention to all important scientific experiments, and absorb new knowledge. However, most practitioners are busy with work all day and have no time to study new works, or are unable to obtain new works, thus needing to refresh their knowledge of old medical principles. Recognizing this, the colleagues take it as their responsibility to disseminate new knowledge and new discoveries, and thus hold medical lectures. The main topic of the first lecture series is tuberculosis, because tuberculosis is so widespread that seven-tenths of the world's population dies from it, and the disease is especially rampant in China. The first lecture series will consist of seven sessions, and the lecturers, topics, and dates have all been arranged. As for the next lecture series, the theme will be "Blood and its Diseases."

### Cash Abundant - Scattered Buyers

Cash slumped in the black market, turning from a fall to a rise. It dropped to the 17,000 yuan mark and then rebounded. This was because the chips after registration will become increasingly scarce, wealthy buyers are absorbing them, the Japanese military notes are stable and strong, and due to tight money conditions, the price was finally slightly squeezed up. Initially, in the morning, a seller pressed the price down by 250 yuan to 17,000 yuan. Then, limited-price buyers rose up, and Chengji, Decheng, Hongqing, Yongyu, and a certain securities firm came to absorb them. Scattered investors competed to push up the price, and it gradually rose to 17,850 yuan. Xiangxing Yong and a certain gold shop and securities firms sold short, and rumors spread about restrictions on deposits and withdrawals. The market became weak and tired, and the price fell by 550 yuan to 17,300 yuan. Because it was Saturday, the market closed at 11:00 AM at 17,350 yuan, an increase of 100 yuan compared to the previous day's close, with a difference of 850 yuan. After the close, it rose to around 17,500 yuan, but trading was even scarcer. The selling price of gold ornaments in silver shops, Daxin and other firms first raised the price to 1,850 yuan per tael, then returned to the same level, and later quoted 1,800 yuan (buying back at a discount of 200 yuan). Fine silver was at 20 yuan, and the black market price had retreated to 13.5 yuan. Silver coins were at 8.35 yuan each, all showing a decline.

The foreign exchange market was stable. British and American gold pounds were at 400 yuan and 410 yuan respectively, a slight increase. US dollar notes remained at 25-26 yuan, Hong Kong notes at 3.45 yuan. Japanese military notes initially were at 7.35 yuan, gradually rising from 7.3 yuan to 7.4 yuan, and then falling back to the final 7.25 yuan, the same as the previous day's price.

### Public Bonds' Soaring Momentum Suddenly Suffers Setback

The public bond grey market changed again yesterday. Just as it was high-spirited and thriving, it was suddenly hit by unfounded rumors. Although they were nothing more than fabrications, there were also blind followers who stirred up trouble. In fact, tighter credit conditions were indeed a reality in the past few days, but since public bonds themselves are usually traded through transfers, this did not have much impact. Yesterday's sellers were mostly Yuxing and Tongyi, and the rest were Jiufeng, Maoda, Wuhe, Renfeng, Lianyi, Dakangcheng, and Yiji, all seeking to sell. However, buyers such as Chengkang alone absorbed 300,000 to 400,000 of Ding-class bonds. Tongkang sold Ding and bought Bing. Hongxing, Runde, Hongda, Runli, Yongxiang, Tongyuan, and Hu Heji also made slight replenishments. Most were settling transactions due to Saturday. Turnover was approximately 1 million yuan.

At the same time, the household fixed-price rice in the city was also being sold, each household still limited to 5 sheng, and the price was also increased, each 5 sheng sold for 7.5 yuan in reserve notes and 10 yuan in old legal tender, an increase of 2.5 yuan compared to the previous period.

### Holiday Relationship - Coarse Grains Slightly Added

### Woolen Trading - Colleagues Mostly Buying, Hoarders Have Mostly Come Out

Yesterday's woolen trading was still extremely prosperous, with hoarding exceeding actual sales. Spring, summer, autumn, and winter goods, and lining for western clothing, were traded in retail and wholesale, and were quite smooth. Actual sales of western clothing and door-to-door sales were far less prosperous than the market trading. It was found that most of those who had recently been hoarding and selling were member shops of the same industry. Non-members and outside hoarders were not interested in hoarding again due to the implementation of restrictions on movement starting on April 1. As a result, the market trend on the big road yesterday already had a tendency to decline in the dark. The trend of summer wool, cotton, yarn, and ramie goods was half as good as the elegance of the beginning of the week.

### Pineapple

— Gao Jiannong

The first thing to declare is that pineapple is a common name, a borrowed name. Our botanists, according to the Taiwan Prefecture Records, have set its scientific name as "pineapple"; its Latin name is Ananas, and there are other names such as screwpine, bolo, gong mallet... and so on. It seems that this tropical plant, once it enters our country, is like being stained with the "habits of the literati school"; one name to the left, one name to the right, plus a few nicknames and aliases, so we are made dizzy and a little elusive.

It is a type of evergreen herbaceous tropical plant belonging to the pineapple family and pineapple genus, with a very low stem; surrounding the stem are large leaves arranged in a spiral pattern, each leaf about two or three feet long and one or two inches wide, with a pointed end and serrated edges, and a smooth leaf surface in dark green. The appearance and shape are almost the same as the dragon tongue orchid (Agave) that we can sometimes see in Shanghai. Its roots are thin and have many branches, and these kinds of roots often coil around the stem, not necessarily deeply buried underground like other plants. Its fertility and regenerative power are extraordinarily strong: looking at it from the outside, it seems to be dead, but once planted, it can still develop and prosper, which is also an excellent condition in the evolutionary process of survival competition. The new leaves of the pineapple, probably from the initial division and planting to one and a half or two years, will pull out a straight flagpole-like stem from the leaves, about two feet high, with a cluster of small leaves on top, called the "leaf crown."

Family

### Talking About Joint Families

— Yongren

In these years of expensive goods, regardless of the size of the family, they all feel very difficult in terms of clothing, food, housing, and transportation. Especially uneconomical is that a family, no matter the size, always needs the necessary equipment, such as pots, stoves, bowls, etc., which are indispensable. The money spent on these items accounts for at least 20-30% of the total expenditure, and there is no way to save on them. This is really a painful thing that every family cannot express!

To remedy the shortcomings in this area, the proposal of joint families has emerged. Although the term "joint family" is novel and seems unfamiliar to people in Shanghai, joint families have long been adopted by some people in places like Chongqing, Kunming, and Guiyang, and the results of implementation have been very satisfactory.

Joint families can be said to be a further step in the division of labor and cooperation, bringing together different people from different families through mutual assistance. Whether in terms of clothing, food, housing, or transportation, implementing joint families not only saves a lot of expenses but also increases convenience. Here, I will only talk about food, which is the most important aspect of a family.

Under the joint family system, food is cooked together, so there is no need to use kerosene stoves for one family and coal stoves for another. In this way, many utensils are saved. At the same time, ask an experienced cook, and they will be able to tell you in detail that large-pot rice and large-pot dishes are very economical and cost-effective in all aspects. Moreover, rice can also be purchased in large quantities in advance, avoiding the disadvantage of soaring market prices. The situation is the same for fuel. There are truly countless benefits like these.

In addition, in terms of clothing, housing, and transportation, clothing such as raincoats and umbrellas can be shared, housing such as living rooms and bathrooms can be shared. For transportation, fundraising to jointly purchase bicycles, etc., the scope of cooperation can be large or small, and the result is always beneficial and without any disadvantages. This joint family system can be regarded as a small-scale consumer cooperative. In terms of economic principles, this system has two major benefits: the division of labor and cooperation, and mass production. These two are the most economical and efficient.

Naturally, joint families are only a unique product of this era. Considering the current situation in Shanghai, under the whip of a severe life, implementing joint families may be a way to slightly improve the situation. Moreover, it is common for more than ten families to live in one building in Shanghai. If joint families can be implemented, it does not seem that there would be any difficulties.

However, my suggestion may be too big, but in reality, this is indeed the easiest method to implement. If someone thinks it is difficult to do, then the only difficulty, I think, is that the number of people in each family varies, the economy is prosperous and tight, the customs are different, and the measures are wide and narrow! But why can't these difficulties be overcome? Know that the greatest purpose of joint families is to fight against the difficult environment with the strength of the majority in difficult situations. If each family cannot understand this principle and cooperate sincerely with each other, without any gaps, then they have already lost the original intention of joint families!

### Pillowcases

— Jiang Lang

Almost every household has pillows, and with pillows, you must have pillowcases.

Pillowcases are most susceptible to dirt, so they need to be washed frequently; especially for those modern friends who love to be pretty, their heads are full of heavy oils (hair oil and perfume, etc.). Although they look shiny and bright, in fact, these things are really the dirtiest. If you don't wash them often, it only takes a few short days to soil the beautiful and clean pillowcases.

Many people are indeed very attentive to pillowcases. They often pay a lot of attention to the color, style, pattern, and so on. In fact, pillowcases with some patterns are certainly more beautiful, but even the plain white ones are very practical, and after they are worn out, they can be repurposed.

I simply don't understand why people are so happy to embroider cheesy words like "Sister, I love you" on pillowcases. It makes people feel disgusted immediately. I hope that from now on, everyone can avoid using these sentences. On the contrary, if we want to embroider words, we can embroider things like "Rise at dawn" or "Dance at the sound of the rooster," which are more meaningful. What do you readers think?

### Parents Who Want to Sell Their Daughter into Prostitution

— Bi

My parents are both nearly fifty years old, and they only have me, their nineteen-year-old daughter. We also fled from another province. At first, we stayed with a distant relative. I was even able to attend night school. My father is illiterate like my mother, and he is also a heavy drinker. Wine is his second life. As long as he has wine to drink, he doesn't care about anything else! He still doesn't have a regular job, only hanging around in gambling dens for the past two years. Soon, the distant relatives didn't have a house to live in themselves, so we had to start a family on our own again.

For several years, my father ruined his body, my mother took care of the housework, and I was like a lamb being led to the slaughter! Gentlemen, you must believe me, I worked as a waitress in amusement parks, a server in bars... all because I didn't want to sell my virginity. Every time I struggled out of a hotel room, I lost my livelihood. I am confident that I have worked hard and struggled. Every day I buy the Shen Bao to look at the employment section. There are indeed places that need women every day, but if it is a legitimate job, I am not educated enough, or it is not enough to support the family—like working in a factory, wrapping candy, embroidering, knitting woolen sweaters, etc.—otherwise, it is a life of misery! But I always seek to breathe on the line of death, so I have been a dancer until now. Although I have encountered dangerous situations many times, with my determination, I have maintained my purity until now. However, alas, the devil refuses to let me go!

I believe everyone has motherly love. As their only daughter, my mother loves me even more; but the rising cost of living, my lack of "fame," and my father's drinking have changed my mother! She even said, "It's easy for you to become famous, why don't you know how to...," and my mother told me to find a rich man, and the family would be fine; but I don't like anyone, so my mother is always complaining and scolding me. Some time ago, there was indeed a dancer who was relatively the most sincere, and his age, financial situation, etc., all met my ideals. But my mother didn't allow it (because he was young), and he persuaded me to run away together; suddenly my nerves tingled, and I thought, of all the people I have the opportunity to approach, where is there a capable person? If he is a hopeful, progressive young man, how could he get close to me, clearly he has already fallen! Ah! I am still an accomplice! So I decided to give him up.

Recently, a fat man in his fifties asked for me unsuccessfully, and somehow he found my parents: my mother actually agreed, and my father always follows my mother. One night, my parents took turns threatening and coaxing me, crying and begging me to agree. Regardless of the fact that the man already had many wives and concubines.

Originally, I could have gone with the flow, but because I have read some books, I know that there is happiness, love, and hope in this world... I don't want to end my life by suicide! But I think that if this continues, I will inevitably die! If there is no way, who can give me a way!

### A Week's Home-Style Menu

— Ms. Hua Ying

In last week's menu, I advocated saving oil, which was quite赞同 by the general housewives. Originally, the prices of raw oil and soybean oil have soared recently, and it is also difficult to buy good oil. When buying oil, you have to line up to squeeze it, which really makes housewives miserable. Fortunately, whether cooking vegetarian or meat dishes, there are ways to save oil. For meat dishes such as chicken, duck, fish, and meat, boiling in white or simmering in clear broth tastes no less than braising in soy sauce. White stewed chicken and white stewed duck, if you add some ham inside, the beauty of the soup is actually superior to braising in soy sauce. As for pork, in this season of eating bamboo shoots, stewing fresh pork and marinated pork with bamboo shoot pieces is really the best. Shanghainese call it stewed "fresh and marinated," and Suzhou people call it "marinated and fresh," which is a seasonal dish in the second or third month of spring. Fish such as steamed mandarin fish, steamed grass carp with wine lees, clear steamed crucian carp soup with clams, and stewed yellow croaker with pickled mustard greens are all light and delicious. It is only in vegetables such as stir-fried greens and fried alfalfa that heavy oil is indispensable. Currently, lard seems to be cheaper than raw oil and soybean oil, and there is no need to line up to squeeze it. If there are no elderly vegetarians in the family, then use lard as a substitute, which is ultimately more fatty and delicious than vegetable oil.

### One Gain in Housework

— Zhu Xun

Old mother. Pork is often difficult to cook until tender. Here is a method: first boil it in water until cooked, then take it out; soak it in cold water, then boil it again and it will be tender.

Bamboo shoots are delicious, but they don't keep for long. Now, peel off the outer sheaths of the bamboo shoots, cut them lengthwise and crosswise, put them in a wine jar, stuff the opening with straw, and turn the jar upside down on a basin filled with water, and it can be preserved for a long time without spoiling.

Scalding is a common occurrence when preparing dishes. The scalded area can be coated with sesame oil or Vaseline to prevent inflammation, or soaked in salt water to stop pain and inflammation; if the injury is too severe, apply carbolic acid ointment or medicinal ointment.

For breastfeeding infants, pay attention to the infant's feeding time. Each time should not exceed fifteen to twenty minutes at most. As for nighttime feeding, it should be prohibited. This allows the infant's digestive system to have a longer rest and also ensures that the diet is properly measured.
