### Cripps Drafts Reply, Submits to Indian National Congress

Anglo-Indian Negotiations Near Final Stage

New Delhi, 6th (Havas) – Sir Stafford Cripps, the British envoy to India, originally scheduled to meet foreign reporters tomorrow to announce the final results of talks with Indian leaders, has postponed the meeting. The reason is believed to be that Cripps needs to draft a reply to be submitted to the President of the Indian National Congress, Acharya Kripalani. Cripps is also scheduled to meet three members of the Viceroy's Executive Council this afternoon.

New Delhi, 6th (Reuters) – The President of the National Congress, Acharya Kripalani, told reporters that Sir Stafford Cripps sent a letter to him today.

Bombay, 6th (Reuters) – The President of the Hindu Mahasabha, V. D. Savarkar, cabled Cripps, emphasizing the unreliability of agreements solely between the Congress Party and the Muslim League, and stating that Hindus welcome plans that do not dismember India.

New Delhi, 5th (Havas) – According to reliable sources, the final result of British envoy Sir Stafford Cripps' visit to India will be revealed no later than tomorrow evening or the night after. This can be inferred from the fact that the Standing Committee of the All-India National Congress is scheduled to leave the city on the 8th of this month. As for the so-called "powerful intervention," referring to President Roosevelt's attempt to salvage the situation at the last minute to prevent Cripps' failure, it has apparently not yet been launched.

Stockholm, 6th (Transocean) – According to well-informed sources in London, if the Congress Party accepts Cripps' proposal, General Wavell, Commander-in-Chief of British Forces in India, will command the military, while Nehru will be responsible for supplying war materials and recruiting new soldiers as the Indian Minister of Defense. It is claimed that President Roosevelt's representative in India, Johnson, carries a letter from Roosevelt to Nehru. London sources believe that a response from New Delhi is expected no earlier than tomorrow.

Tokyo, 6th (Domei) – The Information Bureau announced this afternoon Prime Minister Tojo's statement, warning Indian leaders not to be misled by British sweet talk and to reject Cripps' proposal for solving the Indian problem. The statement also expressed the hope that the Indian people would seize this opportunity to realize their long-held aspiration of "India for the Indians."

Tokyo, 6th (Domei) – The acting spokesman of the Japanese Cabinet Information Bureau, Mr. Hori, told foreign reporters today that even if India reaches a compromise with the British on the issue of military power, India will still inevitably be a British appendage if it does not achieve complete political independence.

Congress Resolution To Be Announced This Morning

New Delhi, 6th (Havas) – The President of the Indian National Congress, Acharya Kripalani, declared today that the resolution passed by the Standing Committee of the National Congress regarding the issue of Indian military power, pending a reply from British envoy Sir Stafford Cripps within days, will be submitted to relevant parties tonight and announced tomorrow morning.

New Delhi, 6th (Reuters) – When asked by reporters whether the resolution of the Standing Committee of the National Congress on the British proposal could be released tomorrow morning, Mr. Kripalani said it was not yet certain and might be released tomorrow evening.

New Delhi, 6th (Reuters) – The President of the National Congress, Acharya Kripalani, said that Nehru had reported the details of his conversation with President Roosevelt's personal representative, Johnson, to the Standing Committee of the National Congress. The committee deliberated for two hours this morning and is scheduled to continue the discussion at 3:00 PM.

Allahabad, 6th (Reuters) – The Standing Committee of the All-India Muslim League extensively discussed the British proposal yesterday and decided to postpone drafting a formal resolution, pending further negotiations between the League's President, Jinnah, and Cripps. It is reported that the committee has decided to grant Jinnah full powers to realize the League's policy.

Bangkok, 6th (Transocean) – A report from New Delhi today states that Gandhi left New Delhi for his hometown after his second meeting with British Minister Cripps last week. Before leaving New Delhi, Gandhi stated that it would be of no benefit to India if he continued to stay in New Delhi and have further meetings with Cripps.

Allahabad, 6th (Reuters) – The Muslim League held a public meeting last night and passed a resolution authorizing the League's President, Jinnah, to take any action he deems appropriate and consistent with the League's principles and objectives to promote the League's goals. The proposer of the motion said that in the current international situation, it is necessary for the President to have this power. According to Jinnah, the resolution does not mean that he has been appointed as a dictator, but rather aims to grant him certain designated powers to be used in times of urgency.

Cairo, 5th (Reuters) – The Cairo correspondent of the London Daily Mail reports that Arab leaders are planning to send a letter to the eighty million Muslims in India, urging them to accept Cripps' proposal. The Prime Minister of Transjordan, Tewfik Pasha Abul Huda, who is currently in Cairo, told reporters yesterday that in his personal opinion, accepting the British proposal is beneficial to India. Britain's actions in the Near East are sufficient proof of its commitment to its promises.

### U.S. Representative Meets Nehru

Bangkok, 6th (Transocean) – According to news from New Delhi, Indian National Congress leader Nehru held his first meeting with President Roosevelt's personal representative in India, Johnson, on Saturday. The talks lasted for two and a half hours. After talking with other Indian leaders, Johnson will report on the situation in India to President Roosevelt. Roosevelt specially sent a personal representative to India in order to obtain direct information.

New Delhi, 6th (Reuters) – The President of the All-India Congress Committee, Acharya Kripalani, and Nehru met with Colonel Johnson, President Roosevelt's special envoy to India, for an hour this afternoon.

Wardha, 6th (Reuters) – Gandhi has returned to Wardha after meeting with Cripps in New Delhi.

### Japanese Aircraft First Airstrike on Ceylon Island, Losses and Casualties Unknown

Tokyo, 6th (Domei) – The Japanese General Headquarters announced at 4:00 PM today that Japanese naval aircraft launched an attack on Colombo, the British military base on Ceylon Island, targeting enemy warships, merchant ships, aviation facilities, and major military equipment, inflicting heavy damage.

Lisbon, 6th (Domei) – When Japanese aircraft launched their first air raid on Colombo on the 5th, the situation was chaotic as most of the city's residents were in the suburbs or elsewhere due to the day being a Sunday. As for the extent of the damage, no news has yet been received. According to the Colombo Defense authorities, the Japanese aircraft broke through low clouds and appeared over Colombo. Air raid sirens blared, followed by the roar of anti-aircraft guns, rapid-firing guns, and machine guns. The Japanese aircraft calmly carried out intense bombing of military targets, especially the harbor, docks, and vehicle factories.

### Indians Insist on Serving on Defense Committee, Claim it will Inspire Patriotism in Indians, Statement by Leader of Nationalist Party

London, 6th (Reuters) – The Daily Chronicle recently published a cable from Sir Purushottamdas Thakurdas, leader of the Indian Nationalist Party, stating that India has a vast territory and population, and only an Indian Defense Committee can inspire patriotism in Indians and fully utilize it. To say that Indians serving on the Defense Committee would not be able to work together with the wartime cabinet is a mistaken and suspicious policy that should be abandoned immediately. British and Indian politicians must know how to adjust the relationship between the British Commander-in-Chief and the Indian Defense Committee. If the Defense Committee is staffed by Indians, it will have the greatest psychological impact; otherwise, no matter how perfect the plan, there is a risk of failure.

### In Smolensk Region, Red Army Captures Several Cities, Bryansk Surrounded by Soviet Guerrillas, Germany Claims to be Attacking Red Army in Three Locations

Moscow, 6th (Reuters) – Reports indicate that fierce fighting continues in the Smolensk and Bryansk areas on the Central Front. According to dispatches from the Red Star's war correspondent, the Red Army has captured several cities in the Smolensk area. The progress of the Red Army is attributed to the artillery. As for the Bryansk area, a railway junction located 220 miles southwest of Moscow, which has been occupied by German forces for several months, is now almost entirely surrounded by Soviet guerrillas.

Moscow, 6th (Reuters) – A Soviet communique confirms that the fighting on the Northern Front of the Eastern Front is intensifying. The communique states that our forces in the Kalinin area captured an enemy stronghold, seizing four cannons, seven machine guns, 1,600 shells, 832 gas masks, and countless other military supplies. A cavalry unit repelled an enemy attack and annihilated 788 enemy soldiers, destroying six enemy tanks in a single day.

London, 6th (Reuters) – Berlin reports that Germany announced that German aircraft bombed Moscow last night, and German forces in the Central Front captured several villages.

Führer Headquarters, 6th (Transocean) – The German High Command announced this afternoon that after several days of fighting, Soviet forces on the Central Front of the Eastern Front captured 69 strongholds, losing, in addition to personnel, 47 cannons, 27 howitzers, 132 machine guns, and a large number of rifles and pistols. Yesterday, Soviet forces lost a total of 46 aircraft in air combat or on the ground. We lost only two aircraft. The German Air Force carried out successful night raids on the Soviet aircraft factory in Rubinsk and military targets in Moscow.

Spring Offensive About to be Launched

Lausanne (Havas) – The newspaper reports today, citing reliable sources in Berlin, that the German spring offensive will be launched within two weeks or two months and will still be a blitzkrieg, completely overturning the plans of the Red Army General Staff. Its strategy will be completely different from that adopted when the German-Soviet war broke out. At the beginning of the war on the Eastern Front, the German army used a "pocket strategy," which was always successful, but this spring, it will not repeat the old method. At the same time, the German General Staff also wants to find a way to make the Soviet Union abandon the strategy it used last winter. The main effort of the Axis powers seems to be to achieve decisive results in the shortest possible time, without a doubt. Conversely, the anti-Axis powers believe that the Soviet Union is engaged in large-scale warfare on the Eastern Front in order to contain the main force of the Red Army from being transferred elsewhere, and its main goal is to attack the Caucasus or the Middle East oil region. Whether or not Germany is most concerned about the replenishment of oil, in addition, the German army will launch an offensive on the southern route of the Eastern Front, and General Rommel, commander of the German army in North Africa, will also attack Egypt, so as to echo the offensive launched by the German army in the East.

Finland's Future Fraught with Difficulties

Stockholm, 5th (Havas) – A report from the Finnish capital states that Finland will encounter two major difficulties this spring, namely military and economic problems. From a military point of view, Finland must always determine the scope of its participation in the German spring offensive, generally actively assisting the German army in attacking Murmansk and sparing no effort to prevent the British and Americans from transporting supplies to the Soviet Union. This is one aspect. From an economic point of view, the livelihood of the people depends entirely on the military situation and has now reached a very difficult point. It is necessary to fully develop all economic resources throughout the country in the spring and summer, not only in agriculture, but also in the timber and export industries, so as to increase exports and be able to purchase the goods needed for the coming winter from abroad. However, the solution to the economic problem lies in manpower, but Finland's manpower has been used as much as possible for the war, so there is a deep sense of manpower shortage. In addition, Finnish public opinion is fully aware of the need for the country to actively fight alongside the Axis forces on the northern route of the Eastern Front, and always believes that Britain has the possibility of opening up a second front in northern Scandinavia, and the German General Staff seems to be intensifying its actions in this area, because protecting the German flank is extremely important after the port of Murmansk is isolated from the outside world and the Murmansk railway is cut off.

### Tomb Sweeping Holiday Ends, Silver and Money Industries Reopen Today, Association to Hold Fourth Quarter Internal Market Conference

The silver and money industries' four-day tomb sweeping holiday, which started on April 3rd, has ended. They are approved to reopen today. All matters related to the receipt and settlement of bills during the holiday period will be handled after reopening today. All industry markets will reopen and resume trading today. The money industry members and exchange firms, in view of the approaching fourth quarter, have all prepared to handle the repayment and lending of long-term credit funds. It is reported that those long-term customers with good credit will be allowed to extend their terms. However, new loans must have reliable guarantors and be filled out according to the format prescribed by the same industry association. The Money Industry Association will soon convene managers from the exchange firms to hold a fourth quarter internal market conference to make a public decision on the internal market prices and all matters related to the fourth quarter. As for the previous regulations on restricting withdrawals and deposits in the silver and money industry, although there is no formal order to cancel them, they have in fact been abolished informally. After the Bank Clearinghouse Association finished settling interbank transfers for each bank and firm, all bills will be divided into transfers and cash. All bills stamped with the words "This bill is only allowed for transfer" can only be transferred and cannot be cashed.

### To Strengthen Security in the International Settlement, Local Self-Defense to be Reorganized

Since the Public Security Bureau of the International Settlement organized local self-defense groups by drawing Ding Zhuang from the organized Baojia system to rotate day and night to watch over guard posts and implement the citizen self-defense system, not only has it been able to assist the authorities in preventing the occurrence of terrorist incidents within the International Settlement, but it has also been sufficient to eliminate street robbery incidents. However, recently, some members of the self-defense groups in various districts have either been unable to stand guard on time due to business affairs or have simply been unwilling to stand guard due to their status, resulting in substitutes and even those who do not meet the legal age (males aged 20 to 45 years old). It should be known that the self-defense system is a good system. If it is not thoroughly implemented, not only will it lose its original purpose, but it will also cause concern for the safety of citizens. The authorities have decided to reorganize the self-defense personnel in various districts thoroughly to ensure that situations such as those who do not meet the legal age and substitutes are cleared up as soon as possible.

### Public Works Bureau Resumes Work After Holiday

### Rice Shops Refuse Old Currency, Fined

The authorities of the two concessions, considering the rising prices of goods in the city, which are of great importance to people's livelihood, have organized evaluation committees to assess the prices of various goods and dispatched personnel to investigate and prevent unscrupulous merchants from privately raising prices or secretly reducing volume. It has come to our attention that two rice shops, Shisheng and Gongping, located at the end of Route Cardinal Mercier, refused to accept old legal tender when selling subsidized Xiang rice some time ago, requiring customers to use Central Reserve Bank notes to buy rice. This, in effect, resulted in an additional profit of sixty yuan on top of the evaluated price of two hundred yuan per dan (unit of weight). After being investigated by the authorities, the two rice shops were deemed to be profiting illegally. The relevant authorities summoned the owners of the two shops to be dealt with, each being fined one thousand yuan as a warning.

### Hai Fu Wheel Returns to Chinese Ownership, Will Operate Between Shanghai and Dinghai, Hana's Destination Undecided, Gaodeng to Sail to Jiangbei

The German company Lihe Yanghang's Hai Fu vessel was originally owned by the Zhoushan Shipping Company. To facilitate navigation, it was registered under the German consulate and operated under the name of the shipping department of Lihe Yanghang. The vessel is now restoring its Chinese ownership under Zhoushan Shipping Company due to changes in the shipping situation, cancelling the German company's name. As the shareholders of the vessel are all gentry and merchants from Dinghai residing in Shanghai, after reverting to Chinese ownership, the planned route will be the Shanghai-Zhoushan line. The necessary procedures for navigation are gradually being completed, but the allocation of personnel and duties is still being planned and will be agreed upon soon.

Repainting Decks

The Hai Fu wheel has a net tonnage of 800 tons and is one of the medium-sized ships that used to operate on the Shanghai-Zhejiang route. After being decommissioned from the Zhejiang Sea route last year, the vessel has been docked at the Dongjiadu pontoon on the Huangpu River. The vessel is currently being repainted. According to inquiries made by a Datong News Agency reporter to the shipping company, while they acknowledged that the vessel is currently being reorganized and is planning to restore its Chinese ownership, they were unwilling to make any statements regarding sailing to Zhoushan. The German company Far East Company's Hana vessel is also docked at the Dongjiadu pontoon on the Huangpu River, and its deck is also being repainted. Although there have been reports of it sailing to Ningbo, this has not materialized. The German company Gaodeng, which used to operate on the Shipu-Haimen line, is planning to sail on the Jiangbei route. There is no news of the Fei Kang vessel's sailing route. Both vessels are currently docked at the Dongjiadu pontoon on the Huangpu River.

### Xu Daquan, Protagonist in Fratricide Case, Fiancée Terminates Engagement

The case of Xu Songtao, the young owner of the Huamei Pharmacy, who was hacked to death with an axe by his younger brother Xu Daquan (also known as Songtao), once shocked society. After the case, the relevant defendants were arrested by the French Concession Police and prosecuted. It has been a long time since the case was finalized. It is now learned that the protagonist of the case, Xu Daquan, was previously engaged to Zhang Cui'e, the daughter of a wealthy merchant surnamed Zhang, who resided in Wufeng Lane, Avenue Joffre. However, after the fratricide case occurred, Zhang's daughter requested her parents to terminate the engagement with Xu Daquan. Zhang's daughter has now retained a lawyer to declare the termination of the engagement with Xu Daquan, stating briefly that the engagement was arranged by her parents and the marriage contract signed on September 7th last year. However, Xu has been convicted of murdering his own brother and has been diagnosed with mental illness, appearing foolish and dazed, and is considered incurable. How can they marry and live as husband and wife in the future? Since the tragedy occurred, she has felt spiritual and material harm. If the engagement is not terminated, it will have a significant impact on her future happiness. Therefore, she is legally terminating the engagement and reserving the right to claim damages.

### A True Record of Refugee Children's Lives

Recently, articles calling for help for refugee children have frequently appeared in newspapers, which is enough to make people concerned about the seriousness of the refugee children problem; but among the readers, there are probably very few who know the actual situation of refugee children's lives. The day before yesterday, I happened to meet the person in charge of a certain educational institution, who told me about the general situation of the institution, and I think all readers will be happy to know.

According to him, there are currently about thirty nurseries for refugee children and infants in this city, accommodating a total of more than 6,000 refugee children and infants. This number is quite large and astonishing. The educational institution accommodates 300 children. Although some of them have been dismissed due to the difficulty of obtaining food and funds, 250 children are still being cared for.

The institution is co-sponsored by many well-known organizations, such as the Public Works Bureau Chinese Staff Association, the China Child Welfare Association, the Customs Club, the Department Store and New Medicine Industry Associations, etc. In addition to a portion of funding allocated by various organizations, the majority of the funding must rely on donations from enthusiastic people from all walks of life in society.

The institution is named "Shanghai Child Welfare Educational Institution," and its purpose is to "cherish the young of others as we cherish our own." The educational institution is quite ordinary, with a complete primary school system, with a total of six grades, divided into low, middle, and high three stages. In terms of teaching, in addition to implementing the regulations of the primary school curriculum, it also attaches great importance to imparting productive knowledge and skills, cultivating children's labor habits, and training children's self-government ability. In addition to teaching children to read and write, each teacher must also pay close attention to every child's eating, drinking, and daily life, so that teaching work and management work are closely coordinated, and the combination of management and teaching is effectively implemented.

Sixty percent of the children come from outstanding children in various shelters in the past, and are sent to the institution by their competent authorities. Forty percent are introduced to the institution by various organizations or individuals. Most of their families are servants (accounting for 60-70%), and there are also low-paid employees, poor farmers, poor teachers, and even the unemployed. They are all extremely lonely and poor, and 10% are orphans who have no relatives.

The institution not only provides education and care for lonely and poor children, but also lays the foundation for their future social outlets. Therefore, in addition to imparting basic national knowledge, it especially focuses on imparting self-reliant production skills; it has two workshops for mechanical milling and rattan work, which all children aged 14 and above in middle and high grades must participate in. In addition, there are various service labors, such as cooking, cleaning, maintaining order, and taking care of diseases, which all children must universally undertake, in order to achieve the practical effect of cultivating labor habits and improving work ability.

In terms of supply, the institution has new-style steam stoves for cooking; two meals a day, each child eats an average of 13 liang of rice per day; corn is the main food, accounting for about 70%, and the rest is broken Xiang rice; as for vegetable expenses, each child only has more than 30 cents a day, so they can only eat some green vegetables, radishes and other vegetables.

Not long ago, the Public Works Bureau's Children's Protection Section conducted a precise study and statistics on children's nutrition as follows: to meet the nutritional needs of each child aged 7 to 17, they must eat 15 liang of grains, 15 liang of vegetables, 3 liang of beans, 2 liang of oil, and 4 liang of eggs, fish, and meat per day. Calculated according to market prices, the cost of food for each child per month requires more than 80 yuan; however, due to the institution's financial difficulties, the cost of food for each child per month is only about 45 yuan. Therefore, most of the children in the institution are in a state of semi-starvation, but their health is not adversely affected, it is said.

The institution is limited in space. Therefore, there are no bedroom facilities. After the evening lessons are over, the duty students stack the desks and chairs on one side, spread the mats and blankets on the ground to sleep, and after the morning bell rings, they put the blankets and mats away neatly in a corner, and then line up the desks and chairs to restore the original state of the classroom when class is in session.

Medical and health care for children is very important to children's health, so the institution is very concerned about it. In addition to having a medical room and a ward for the diagnosis and treatment of sick children, there is a resident nurse and seven enthusiastic well-known doctors are regularly rotated to provide free diagnosis and treatment for sick children, and children with more serious illnesses are sent to the hospital for diagnosis and treatment by the institution. For the rest, such as bathing, haircuts, washing clothes, and cutting nails, etc., the dates are specified and the full-time instructors are responsible for strict supervision and implementation. The children in the institution can maintain good health under poor nutrition, which is undoubtedly due to this.

In addition to attending classes, studying, participating in production work, and labor service, it is their own world; staging plays, singing, playing table tennis, playing basketball, playing volleyball, reading newspapers, etc., these extracurricular activities are self-realization to regulate their body and mind.

The person in charge also said that since serving difficult education, I have deeply realized that the qualifications of these difficult children are not worse than those of ordinary children. On the contrary, due to the constant grinding of difficult environments, they will know more about human relationships and the understanding of general problems than ordinary children. Even in terms of academic courses, all the children who graduated from the institution last year were admitted to a provincial middle school. This shows that the staff of the institution are serious in their work, but the main reason should be that each difficult child has not underestimated himself and is willing to devote himself to his own achievements!

Children are the new life of the nation, the cornerstone of the country, and the future masters. Saving these difficult children is an urgent matter. This not only requires social people to be more deeply concerned about the safety of these more than 6,000 difficult children, but also should actively extend a helping hand to enable such fragile seedlings to be developed and nourished, which not only achieves Mencius's aim of "cherishing the young of others as we cherish our own," but is also extremely beneficial to the country and society!

### Landlords Change Rent Payment Currency, No Different from Increasing Rent in Disguise, Public Very Apprehensive About This, Hoping Authorities Will Take Appropriate Measures

Since the Public Works Bureau began issuing house subletting licenses on the 1st of this month, the sub-landlords of the Public Concession have been quite enthusiastic about going to the Bureau's tax office and various district offices to obtain licenses. Starting today, the Bureau's Easter holiday is over, and the issuance of subletting licenses has resumed. To comply with the regulations of the subletting license issued by the Public Works Bureau, some sub-landlords have also voluntarily reduced rents. However, it has recently been learned that many landlords are quite picky about the currency in which tenants pay rent, and some refuse to accept national currency (i.e., old legal tender). Recently, most tenants of houses in this city have received notices from landlords stating that starting this month, their rent should be paid in Reserve Bank notes, refusing to accept old legal tender. The notice did not mention whether the rent would be reduced after paying in Reserve Bank notes. This situation is no different from increasing rent in disguise, which is fundamentally contrary to the recent announcements by the two concessions on handling rent, prohibiting unauthorized rent increases. Their house rental contracts clearly state that rent must be paid in national currency (referring to old legal tender). Therefore, the landlord's move is far from legal. The public is quite apprehensive about this, hoping that the authorities of the two concessions will consider this and take appropriate measures.

### Unemployed Vagrants Impersonate Officials to Defraud Money, Offenders Sentenced Separately

Recently, some unemployed ruffians have been impersonating personnel from the Japanese Military Police Headquarters or special agencies, extorting money and robbing legal tender from shops and pedestrians at the bridgeheads of Yangshupu, Hongkou, and Waitanyuan, claiming to be investigating unregistered materials or searching for prohibited items. There are countless cases. The police authorities believe that these bandits are disturbing the peace of shops and pedestrians, which is abhorrent and must be severely punished as a warning.

The Hongkou police arrested Zhang Wenpan, a native of Jiangbei (26 years old), who specialized in colluding with others at Waitanyuan Bridge, Zhabei Road Bridge, and North Sichuan Road Bridge to rob wallets from passengers coming to Shanghai from other places by train when they got off rickshaws at various bridges. He was sent to court and sentenced to two years and six months in prison as a warning.

The Huishan police arrested Xiao Jingliang, a member of the Green Gang (28 years old), who specialized in impersonating personnel from special agencies in the Yangshupu area to defraud pedestrians of money. He was sent to court and, after being interrogated, it was found that he was a first-time offender. As a result, he was sentenced to six months in prison as a warning.

The Hongkou police arrested two bandits from Jiangbei, Wang Xuebao and Wang Xiaoliuzi, who specialized in robbing pedestrians of money near Baitanyuan Bridge and Zhabei Road Bridge. Between January and March, they committed multiple cases, robbing more than 200 yuan in legal tender. They were sent to court, and Wang Xuebao was sentenced to one year and eight months in prison, and Wang Xiaoliuzi was sentenced to two years in prison as a warning.

The Huishi police arrested Yu Leming, a young man from Jiangbei, who extorted 90 yuan in legal tender from Jiang Wanxi near North Jiangxi Road and Haining Road on the pretext of a dispute. He was sent to court and sentenced to eight months in prison for fraudulent extortion as a warning.

### Cruel Daughter-in-Law Abuses Elderly Woman, Angered, She Drowns Herself

Old woman Jiang, over seventy years old, a native of Shaoxing, has a son named Debao, who runs a Dexing paper shop at No. 48 Galle Road in the French Concession. The business is very good. He married a woman named Wu, and they have two sons and three daughters, a family of eight. Life is quite prosperous. Her son Debao has recently profited from hoarding goods and is now a major merchant. His daughter-in-law, Wu, is extremely fierce and unreasonable, and she abuses her elderly mother-in-law, who is over seventy years old. If she is not happy with something, she scolds her and even beats her, subjecting her to abuse. The elderly woman could not bear the pain, so at 9:30 PM last night, she secretly conceived the idea of death and went alone to the North Xizang Road Bridge and jumped down. Fortunately, Chinese Constable No. 1560 of the Huishi Police Station caught a glimpse of her and quickly rescued her and took her to Jimin Hospital for treatment.

### Zhendan Cup Football Match Yesterday

Hequn Red and Zhendan Both Win

Tomorrow's and Weekly Schedules Announced

The Charity Football Zhendan Cup continued its second prelude yesterday, with two matches on the program. In the opening match, Zhendan, taking advantage of its big win over Hongyuan the day before, defeated Nie Zhongcheng 3-1. At the beginning of the match, Nie Zhongcheng's left defender Zhang Jiahe scored an own goal, and Zhendan gained a goal without labor. After that, the game fell into a stalemate, with neither side gaining anything. Zhendan led 1-0 in the first half. After changing sides, Nie Zhongcheng's Xu Shengdi scored a goal in the first minute, tying the score. Soon after, Zhendan's Liu Shaolin and Wu Xie scored one after another. Nie Zhongcheng's counterattack was ineffective. Until the end of the game, the situation finally became 3-1, and Zhendan won. In the main match, Hequn Red and White played against each other. Although they were compatriots, they did not fight fiercely. However, Xiao Ziwen scored a goal, and Hequn Red led its younger brother 1-0 in the first half. After the break, the fighting power of the elder brother, Hequn Red, gradually began to develop. After about ten minutes of engagement, Youliang scored two goals in quick succession, four minutes apart, which was wonderful and added two goals to Hequn Red. Moreover, the strength of the two sides was not only a notch apart. Therefore, under the influence of the situation, Long Hai and Ziwen also scored in order, resulting in a huge difference of 5-0. Until the last four minutes, Hequn White's Cao Qinfang created a miracle on his own, breaking the duck egg and ending the game 5-1. Hequn Red won. Yesterday's ticket revenue totaled more than 600 yuan. The schedule for tomorrow afternoon starting at 5:30 PM is a match between French Police and Hongyuan, with tickets priced at two yuan each.

### Cooking Oil Prices Increase Again

Raw oil military ticket 1.075 yuan

Soybean oil military ticket 1.025 yuan

The source of cooking oil in this city has been delayed due to a shortage of ship berths, resulting in a failure to supply as much as possible. After the wholesale office of the cooking oil industry tried every means, both raw soybean oil have been transported to Shanghai in large quantities. In addition to more than 20,000 dan being distributed, there are currently 3,726 barrels of raw oil and 5,515 barrels of soybean oil in the warehouse. Subsequent batches are still being transported to Shanghai in an endless stream, so the panic over cooking oil will soon be gradually calmed down. In order to make it convenient for citizens to purchase, the wholesale office of the oil industry has increased the allocation to each registered cooking oil retail store by 50% starting yesterday. Restaurants and oil-frying industries and other actual sales users are also given as much allocation as possible according to the registered amount. As for the market price per catty, raw oil is 1.075 yuan per military ticket, soybean oil is 1.025 yuan, and clear oil and rapeseed oil are 0.975 yuan.

### Sunflower Fans and Summer Medicines are Expensive

Summer sunflower fans (commonly known as banana fans) are produced in Guangdong Province. Due to the scarcity of ships and the manipulation of hoarders, the selling price of each sack (i.e., 200 pieces) was about 60 yuan at the end of January. Currently, ox heart has risen to 280 yuan, and they are still unwilling to sell it cheaply. In addition, Longhu Rendan has risen to 75 yuan, headache powder to 43 yuan, Wan Jin You to 48 yuan, Bagua Dan to 42 yuan, and Partridge vegetables to 110 yuan, about three times the increase.

### Dried Scallops and Squid are Increasingly Expensive

Dried scallops are scarce and the market is tight. New prices are seen repeatedly. Middle grains are 4,800 yuan and triangles are 4,600 yuan. Squid has also recently risen sharply. The market price is as high as 3,120 yuan.

### Ningbo Seafood All Rise

Ningbo seafood has also recently been in short supply. Sea jellyfish skin has reached 200 yuan, jellyfish head 140 yuan, Yongming rice noodles 450 yuan, Zhoushan again 550 yuan, Yantai again 600 yuan.

### Golden Vegetables See New Prices Again

Daylily is not abundant in origin, and large households purchase it, so the market price is gradually increasing. Currently, Shuangkang Mike's top village vegetables have opened to a new record of 800 yuan, but only a few. At the same time, the market price is still difficult to keep up, it is said.

### Pile of Silk Turns Flat

The market for Pile of Silk has turned flat, because Western suits are no longer popular. Chinese clothes require 22-23 yuan per single foot, and sales must decrease. Yesterday, Yihua Wufutu Pile of Silk was sold for 912 yuan per yard, Lixing Diaochan map for 100 yuan, Abe 3,000 for 80 yuan, and Japanese manufacturers' goods for 112 Japanese military tickets, etc.

### Talking About "Doing Business"

— Jin Yi

When friends chat idly, after sighing, the conclusion is always nothing more than "It's better to do business." "Doing business" after sighing is different from setting up a food stall or selling peanuts, which are truly "small businesses" that one can carry on one's shoulders and in one's hands. The unspoken meaning is more like doing a "small hoarding business." To be a "big hoarder," one needs power or strength. To be a "small hoarder," one only needs to be quick and adapt to the situation, buying a few hundred dozen tins of Tiger Balm, stuffing them under the bed, and watching the price jump from one yuan and five jiao per dozen (which was a high price last year) to fifty-five yuan for twelve boxes. If one bought 606, the profit would be even better, with a cost price of less than ten yuan per injection, now selling for over seventy yuan on the market. How many dou of rice can a friend who sits in an office and uses his pen day and night, 31 days a month, afford to buy with his earnings? Therefore, one wouldn't sigh if one didn't want to, but once one sighs, one thinks of "doing business."

However, after the introduction and development, there must be a twist and conclusion. By the time our sour friends sigh, it's already "the sunset is infinitely beautiful," meaning, it's too late. A box of Tiger Balm costing more than five yuan only works for buttock pain. If you exchange that for two and a half sheng of foreign rice and keep it at home, perhaps your head won't hurt anymore. Catching syphilis from wild game is your own fault. Moreover, there are slippery goods in the market, and Monsanto saccharin also transforms into Taikoo granulated sugar. When laymen speculate, it's like "a donkey trying to keep up with a horse," and it's definitely your fate to break your leg.

I'm not saying sour grapes. Those trading companies that sell on behalf of customers are the culprits who started this, and the brokers in the market stir up trouble from within. Tiger Balm, 606, as well as Great Health Phoenix saccharin, Osterling calcium... the market rarely sees spot goods. As soon as the brokers raise the price, the market goes up; as soon as the brokers dump their goods, the market goes down. In this rise and fall, money changes hands and surnames. The people who make money are the insiders, and those who lose money are the unlucky friends.

To do business, be down-to-earth. Setting up a sundry stall at the entrance of an alley, making a few hundred yuan a month is not a small amount. Even carrying a small basket, one can barely support one's family.

Only by being down-to-earth can one do business; to do business, one must be down-to-earth. Kites somersault in the clouds; there are days when they soar to great heights, and there are times when they are smashed to pieces!

### Raising Goods is Better Than "Raising" Pigs

— Wang Ye

Mr. Rooster sighed long and hard because no one inquired about his "bidding" for children, and advised people to raise more pigs. In reality, this is ultimately just grumbling! Women physically cannot raise pigs; buying a pig to raise now is also very difficult, one can barely support oneself!

I say raising goods is better than "raising" pigs; there is no time limit, and no fertilizer is needed. Just wait for the right moment, "selling at a low price" will do. Moreover, raising pigs is lowly, while "raising" goods is noble. Goods won't get sick, but pigs will.

Therefore, those who have been influenced by Mr. Rooster's advice to raise pigs should definitely "abandon that and choose me." However, everyone has their own reasons, and it's up to you to believe it or not. But if I had tens of thousands of yuan in my hand, I would rather "raise" some soap, candles, and mosquito incense.

(If a poor person who has no money insists on raising children, then that's just like the old lady in Mr. Rooster's article reciting the Diamond Sutra about the child in the bidding – self-inflicted suffering!)

### Random Thoughts on Spring

— Sha

When you eat lettuce mixed with bamboo shoots, no, Chinese wolfberry shoots and dried fish, spring is already waiting outside your window. For people without new clothes, the arrival of spring is always a bit later. Friends who are busy buying "sweater materials" and looking at fashion styles, how can they wait until around Qingming before considering it spring? They are already preparing summer clothes. Just like those "progressive elements" hoarding undershirts, mosquito incense, ten drops of water, etc., do they wait until now to think of a way?

Do people who eat corn flour as food not have spring? Nonsense! Spring is for everyone, spring has no boundaries. Use one part chocolate powder, five parts corn flour, and an appropriate amount of sugar, make it into an egg shape, steam it, and eat it during the four days from last Friday to yesterday. Whether for entertaining guests or for personal use, it is still meaningful to eat "Qingming eggs." But friends, pure corn flour lacks viscosity, so you must add some flour. Whether you can buy flour or not, I am not responsible. Fortunately, the Spring Festival is over, so it doesn't matter if you don't make it.

If the authorities follow "Gu Tefala Haitai," limiting each person to only buying one bar of soap, this is the "impression" of the start of the spring holiday. Yesterday, I also heard a friend say that a certain restaurant's children's dishes – actually, it's a simple meal sold on Children's Day – can they really pay attention to cooking and maintain the necessary food nutrients for children? I'm afraid not. – All sold out, those who came later had the "regret" of missing out. This is the "conclusion" of the spring holiday.

Kitchenettes and stoves should not be rented out, so the authorities do not include these two places in the list of subleased houses. On Qingming Day, some people hang willow branches on the back door of the kitchenette, and placing paper money on the stove is always much better than under the bed. If you want to maintain the spring of the Shanghai alleyway life class, the stove should leave a few inches of space, and setting up a canvas bed in the kitchenette would be too lacking in "Qingming charm."

Being deceived by hoarding goods, reselling square meters for profit, these things do not necessarily happen around Qingming Festival, but in such good weather, it is truly spring sunshine and gentle spring breeze. Why don't everyone truly rest for a few days, eat and drink casually, and appreciate the "smile" in nature? People say things, does one sheng of foreign rice really turn into two sheng after being blown by the spring breeze? Can 19,500 yuan of cooked glutinous rice really be blown to 20,000 yuan by the "clear breeze on the river"? Haha! Who told you to stand still and watch her twist her butt and slip past your window?

Spring fools are so worthy of praise! Let you have a lifetime of sweet, "poetic" dreams.

### News Roundup

— Xing Yun

A certain soap factory on Maigen Road sells each box for 160 yuan, using the following method:

Each person who buys soap has a number, and then the soap factory authorities draw several prizes. Those who win the prize can buy a box of soap.

Because the price is relatively low, the store door is crowded with people every day, but some people have waited for five days and still haven't bought any. Therefore, some people, after buying it, sell it for 170 yuan to make a small profit.

### Emotion

— Qian Changnian

What makes people feel warmest in body and mind is not the stove, but human emotion.

Death is not scary, the most terrible thing is the emotions that cannot be erased when life comes to an end.

### Sharing the Boat in Storm

— He Jia Zhi

(3) Guests Arrive

This inappropriate shout startled all of the Ye family's relatives and friends, leaving them speechless and stunned. Turning around to look, they saw a tall young man with a purplish-red face covered in sweat. The sweat was turning into wisps of vapor rising upwards. He was wearing a blue cloth uniform, one hand empty, the other clutching a greasy呢帽(possibly a type of hat). He rushed in from the front gate, all the way to the bottom of the steps of Shide Hall. Everyone in the hall turned their faces towards him. Several people recognized him as Huang Long and shouted, "Huang Long, what are you doing?" Huang Long said, "Who died after all? I want to take a look. Wait a bit before you close the coffin lid. Let me through, I want to see…" At that moment, someone said, "The deceased is Madam Ye, Wei Cheng's mother." Huang Long wiped the sweat from his forehead, as if exhaling a breath, and said, "Oh. I said it wouldn't be Brother Wei Cheng. But someone on the road said that Brother Wei Cheng came back yesterday, and today something happened to him. I ran ten miles in one breath to come back."

Everyone blamed Huang Long for being too reckless. Huang Long didn't care and still wanted to squeeze into the crowd to find Wei Cheng. Many people stopped him. They solemnly completed the encoffining of Madam Ye first. Everyone who had received Madam Ye's kindness was crying buckets of tears, let alone Wei Cheng. Wei Cheng was helped to the front to pay his respects. After paying his respects, he was helped to the mourning curtain. Huang Long, regardless of him wearing mourning clothes and shoes, rushed forward and called out, "Brother Wei Cheng." Wei Cheng grabbed his hand, and tears flowed like rain again. Li Youxie also recognized Huang Long a little, walked in and scolded him, "You rushed in, shouting 'Spare the person under the knife?'" Huang Long said, "I couldn't think of any words that you would listen to me. I always hear storytellers in the teahouse saying 'Spare the person under the knife,' so I borrowed it to use today. It doesn't matter." Li Youxie knew Wei Cheng was tired and quickly pulled Huang Long outside, but Huang Long refused. He saw Wei Cheng crying, and he also cried. When he cried, he cried loudly, drowning out even Sister Cuizhen's cries. (43)
