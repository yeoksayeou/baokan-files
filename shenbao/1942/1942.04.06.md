### Indian National Congress Standing Committee Meeting Discussed; Resolutions to be Announced Tomorrow; Achatya's Talk with Wavell: A Scheme Might Be Formed

New Delhi, May 5th, Reuters: The Standing Committee of the National Congress Party met this morning for two hours, then adjourned to continue the discussion tomorrow morning. According to the party's president, Achatya, to reporters, he may announce the main resolutions of the Standing Committee on April 7th (Wednesday), hoping to learn the British War Cabinet's reaction to the resolutions of the National Congress Standing Committee from Cripps by that time.

New Delhi, May 5th, Reuters: The chairman of the Indian National Congress, Achatya, had a very pleasant meeting with General Wavell, Commander-in-Chief of the Indian side, yesterday. Although Achatya is a civilian, he also pays great attention to military affairs. Wavell, on the other hand, has the demeanor of a Confucian general. During the talks, Nehru acted as an interpreter. It is rumored that a scheme may be formed as a result of the talks, dividing the powers of an Indian senior official in the Indian Ministry of National Defense and the Commander-in-Chief of India. Regarding this matter, Indian leaders will state that the Indian side has absolutely no objection to or interference with the British War Cabinet's policies and strategies in a larger scope, only offering opinions. However, within India, the new government should have at least the same powers as Australian Prime Minister Curtin in Australia regarding defense and other policies.

New Delhi, May 4th, Havas: After British Envoy Cripps met with National Congress Chairman Achatya, he immediately introduced Achatya and Nehru to General Wavell, Commander-in-Chief of the British Indian Army. Cripps then withdrew alone, and Wavell and the other two continued the conversation. In addition, the Special Committee of the National Congress met this afternoon for two hours and decided to continue the meeting tomorrow. According to key figures of the National Congress, the meeting will conduct a comprehensive review of the current situation.

Lisbon, May 4th, Allied Press: According to a dispatch from New Delhi, the meeting of Indian National Congress Chairman Achatya, National Congress leader Nehru, British Indian Army Commander Wavell, and Cripps started at 6 PM on the 4th in an unusually tense atmosphere. The outcome of the meeting is not yet clear. Before the meeting, Achatya hinted to reporters that there was room for understanding in the British-Indian negotiations. Judging from various situations, a quick solution to the British-Indian talks is unlikely, but a certain degree of compromise can be reached after the four-person meeting. This view is still powerful.

### Gandhi Returns to Wardha

New Delhi, May 5th, Reuters: Gandhi has left New Delhi and returned to Wardha. He told the press, "I firmly believe that strict silence is most helpful to the country, and you should respect my intentions." When asked if he would advise Bengal to practice non-violence in the current situation, Gandhi replied, "I will advise the whole world in this way, not just Bengal."

New Delhi, May 4th, Havas: Gandhi left here today for Wardha. Before leaving, he gave a talk to the press, saying: "I sincerely advise all countries in the world to take a 'non-violent' attitude. If I were not promoting the policy of non-violence for the love of mankind, I would not be alive today, because life has no other interest for me." Gandhi refused to disclose the details of his meetings with various parties here, only saying that in the current environment, maintaining silence is his best contribution to India.

Saigon, May 5th, Haitong News Agency: According to news from here last night, the news that Gandhi had set off to return to Wardha caused great panic among British and Indian political figures. Gandhi did not explain his unwillingness to influence the negotiations, but it is believed that this matter is of great importance. Gandhi was also present during the discussion of the All-India Congress Executive Committee yesterday, but no decision was made. Gandhi insisted that India would only accept Cripps's proposal if it was not involved in the war vortex. Although Gandhi did not express his opinion before leaving, his attitude has been determined. When asked if Gandhi would advise Bengal to participate in the non-resistance movement at this time, Gandhi replied that not only Bengal, but also the whole world, otherwise this world is not worth his life.

Bombay, May 5th, Reuters: Regarding the question of what attitude the new Indian government will take towards British expatriates and whether it will allow British and other foreign firms to operate in India, as asked by a Canadian youth, Gandhi recently wrote an article in his Harijan weekly, stating: "If I have any influence on Indian policy, foreigners will be welcome, but they must benefit our country and never engage in exploitation that impoverishes our country as they have done before."

### Indian Liberal Party Leader Submits a Note to Britain, Urging the Appointment of an Indian Defense Committee Member, Opposing the Citizen Referendum Measure

New Delhi, May 4th, Havas: Sir Sapru, leader of the Indian Liberal Party, and others recently submitted a note to British Envoy Cripps on behalf of the party and other small parties in India, requesting the appointment of Indian members to the Defense Committee. The text reads:

"The scope of activities of the Defense Committee and the Commander-in-Chief can be easily divided, but measures must still be taken to ensure close cooperation and coordination between the Defense Committee and the General Headquarters. We are eager to do our best to participate in the current war, but we will never be able to achieve anything until Indian members participate in the Defense Committee. We are not unaware of the arguments against this request, and we do not ignore the importance of these arguments, but we still cannot help but speak out because the appointment of Indian members to the Defense Committee will have a major psychological effect on the Indian people and restore their confidence. It is true that the Indian people are not very excited today, but this situation can be changed with just one appointment. The past system of not arming India has not only made us forever weak, but is also outdated. The reason why the people of India cannot trust Britain and have repeatedly harbored doubts is also the same, so this policy must be abandoned immediately. If Britain and India can agree to establish their relations on the basis of sincerity and trust, then a new century can begin from this. In addition, the British plan advocates giving each province the right to freely decide whether to accept or reject the new constitution. This spirit of fairness is admirable. We believe that a compulsory federation will only cause internal resentment and believe that this move will have unfortunate consequences for the integrity and security of the country. Under the current circumstances, holding a referendum, although theoretically a democratic measure, is still sufficient to create serious repercussions, not only endangering the peace and order of the provinces holding the referendum, but also affecting the neighboring areas. As a result, conflicts will occur everywhere. In addition, the method that all bills in the Lower House only need to be passed by a majority vote of all members regardless of nationality is also inappropriate. We advocate that any bill in the Lower House should obtain at least 65% of the votes of Indian members before it can be passed. Furthermore, we believe that the method of having European members of the Lower House participate in voting on bills that are only related to the Indian people is also unreasonable. In short, whether India becomes a federal country should be left to the Indian people to decide freely."

### Cripps Meets with John King to Explain the Negotiation Process and Inquire About American Intentions

Lisbon, May 4th, Allied Press: According to a dispatch from New Delhi, Cripps met with Roosevelt's personal representative John Hansen today. According to reliable rumors, Cripps explained the progress of the British-Indian talks during the meeting and inquired about the American side's intentions regarding the talks.

Washington, May 4th, Havas: The White House announced that Johnson went to India with a letter from the President to a very important Indian leader, but it was not disclosed to whom it was addressed and what the content was.

Senator Washington, May 5th, Reuters: According to the New York Times, President Roosevelt's personal representative, John Hansen, arrived in New Delhi last Friday with a letter from the President to a key Indian figure. The contents are unknown, but it is only known that the key figure is Nehru.

Roosevelt's Letter to Nehru

Washington, May 5th, Reuters

After the news came out that Britain was willing to consider making concessions to India's request for more active participation in the country's defense policy, people's attention here continued to focus on the talks in New Delhi, and the arrival of President Roosevelt's personal representative, Colonel Johnson, as a minister, can further enhance this attention. A White House spokesman said that Colonel Johnson brought a letter from the President and presented it upon arrival. Although the spokesman said that he did not know to whom the letter was addressed, some diplomatic circles believed that the letter was addressed to National Congress leader Nehru. As for newspaper speculation about the possibility of the President mediating to avoid a breakdown in the New Delhi talks, officials did not comment. It is generally believed that although the United States, like other Allied countries, has a major stake in the success of the New Delhi talks, President Roosevelt will not interfere in Britain's internal affairs prematurely.

### Cripps Making Last Efforts in India; Muslim League Must Revise British Proposal Before Accepting

Swiss Capital, May 4th, Havas: The Swiss Telegraph Agency has issued the following message: According to the British Daily Express, British Envoy Cripps is now making a last-minute effort in India. He believes that the realization of the British government's plan is currently promising because there are two major factors that are favorable to Cripps's work. One is that all important Indian leaders are actively supporting Cripps, and the other is that the opinions of British Cabinet members on the Indian issue were originally very divided, but have recently become more moderate. As far as the overall situation is concerned, the main obstacle today is the issue of Indian defense. The British government is willing to maintain its original position at any cost under the current circumstances, but there is no concrete plan for this issue. It is expected that the compromise plan will stipulate that Indian leaders will directly participate in military orders, and that once the war is over, Indian defense will be completely transferred to India for self-management, just like other important issues.

Swedish Capital, May 5th, Haitong News Agency: The Gothenburg Commercial and Maritime Daily's London correspondent reported yesterday that Britain and India are continuing negotiations in India and that Cripps is maintaining close contact with the London War Cabinet, proving that there has been progress in the negotiations on India's defense issue. Although Britain is unwilling to hand over India's defense to Indians, it allows India to send indigenous representatives to join the Defense Committee. Rumor in London has it that President Roosevelt assured Britain that he would implement his promises to India after the war, and he also requested Chongqing to make the same guarantee.

Allahabad, May 4th, Havas: The Executive Committee of the Muslim League held a meeting here this afternoon, chaired by Chairman Jinnah, to discuss the plan proposed by British Envoy Cripps. All executive members were present, except for Hilbert Khan. In addition, Jinnah presented a report to the Standing Committee, stating that the British proposal is only a framework and clearly needs to be supplemented. India has hundreds of millions of Muslims, so the British proposal must be revised to be accepted. The division between Hindus and Muslims in India is a matter of life and death for us.

### Brazil's Measures Surprise Germany, Which Says There Will Be a Day of Retribution

Berlin, May 5th, Haitong News Agency: According to the semi-official news agency, after the Brazilian government severed relations with Germany, it took various violent measures against Axis nationals.

Anti-German demonstrations and abuse and robbery of German expatriates have occurred in the Brazilian capital and other places. Brazil has been selling goods to Germany for hundreds of years, and its current radical anti-German attitude is surprising. Although these atrocities were instigated by the United States, Germany will surely have a day to retaliate against Brazil.

Argentine Capital, May 5th, Haitong News Agency: According to news from the Brazilian capital, Brazilian reserve officers have been conscripted into the army, and President Vargas has abolished the monopoly and other decrees to facilitate the mobilization of industrial resources.

### Béchereau Advocates Rebuilding the Air Force; French Air Show Opens

Vichy, May 4th, Havas: The French Aviation Exhibition was held today with an opening ceremony, presided over by Marshal Petain himself. US Ambassador to France, Rear Admiral Leahy, also participated.

Vichy, May 5th, Havas: Air Minister General Béchereau delivered an opening speech at the Aviation Exhibition today, speaking of rebuilding the French Air Force, saying: "We must rebuild the Air Force within the scope of the Franco-German armistice agreement in order to protect our territories and commercial aviation. Our commercial aviation must be able to keep pace with other countries. Although our aviation industry has encountered various difficulties due to the lack of materials and skilled workers, the planned projects have already been implemented. The resumption of the air route between mainland France and the North African territory of Djibouti is particularly important. French aircraft manufacturing plants resumed work in July 1941. The largest seaplane, weighing 42 tons, was test-flown a few days ago, and two other aircraft weighing more than 70 tons have also been completed. The French Air Force has demonstrated its strength in the two battles against the British in Dakar and Syria. For two years, I have inspected French territories on a regular basis and witnessed that the French Air Force is prepared to resist any aggression. The French Air Force currently has 1,000 new aircraft, which is stronger than when France and Germany went to war in September 1939. The government is also working hard to build airfields and other aviation reserves. In short, the aviation industry has made great strides in the past two years, at least in part because other modes of transportation are no longer available."

An old man of 90 years of age explained that this was a sign of an earthquake nearby and issued a warning to all the residents of the village. Soon after, the earthquake did occur, and all the houses in the village were destroyed. Fortunately, the residents left their homes in time and escaped the disaster, while the sensitive duckling was crushed to death in its cage.

### Turkey's Moat

Some traces can still be seen from the divination images. Nowadays, people often like to act unexpectedly and catch others off guard. This principle, although it has been around for more than two thousand years in our country, still maintains its existence. The same principle applies everywhere, so we can't say that others are copying our old articles. From this point, we may think of the long-cooled Gibraltar offensive, which may be realized under the principle of being unexpected and catching the enemy off guard. It is also common to buy cold horses in lottery tickets and bet on unpopular choices. Therefore, the Gibraltar move is also in the calculations. Otherwise, why would Hitler, after capturing Paris, condescend to interact with Franco of Spain?

But we still have to carefully deduce the divination images again. The long-standing Caucasus march cannot be excluded from the program, can it? Since the freeze-up, isn't the southern Crimean corner a noisy and special commotion? Why make such a commotion on that one peninsula? Opening the map for inspection, it turns out that Crimea is only a bow's length away from the Caucasus. To enter the Caucasus, it is best to regard Crimea as a springboard. With just one leap, you can leap to the Caucasus. The Germans have invested a lot of money here, can you say they don't have this in mind?

Moving the divination images again, we can see two offensives. One of these two offensives, of course, will be the on-again, off-again North African Libyan war. We can often see the war situation in this area in the newspapers. It is said that the Germans are not only very concerned about the war in this area now, but had planned it as early as two years ago. All soldiers preparing to be transferred to Africa must undergo a period of heat training in their home country. The method of training is to confine the soldiers in a large building during the hot summer season. The building is decorated like a real scene in the desert, like shooting a movie. Sand, palm trees, and camels are all available. In addition, there are real-like scorching sun and raging gales, all made with electricity and lighting. The temperature in the room is often above one hundred and ten degrees. From this kind of training, it can be seen that intensifying the offensive in the North African war is exactly what is expected.

The second possible offensive, which was mentioned at the beginning of this article, is the Dardanelles campaign. If we have paid attention to the foreign telegrams in recent days, we will think of Turkey's repeated use of diplomatic phrases, expressing its state of mind. If Turkey is okay, why bother to express its state of mind? There must be a reason that has to be expressed, which is very obvious. Therefore, in the spring offensive, we cannot miss this one. As for whether the Germans are preparing to attack "kindly" or "viciously", we need to ask the viewers to pay attention to the following deductions.

The above points are only to list the possible offensives and make a basis for review. Next, we will use a three-step procedure to carefully detail: First, we must see which offensive is most beneficial to the Axis; second, we must estimate the German material and human resources, and how far they can possibly do it; third, assuming that an attack is launched, what will be the result. In this way, at least we can pierce a small hole in this spring offensive mystery, and reveal as much of the secretly hidden spring scenery as possible, so that the viewers under the stage will not be bored in the dark; wouldn't it be harmful to the harmony of heaven if they get sick from boredom?

Which offensive is most beneficial to the Germans? Six target units have been published earlier: namely, Moscow in the Soviet Union, the British mainland, Gibraltar, the Caucasus, Libya, and the Dardanelles. We divide these six units into three groups according to the direction and location of the offensive: first, westward, namely the British mainland and Gibraltar; second, eastward, namely the Caucasus, Libya, and the Dardanelles; third, northward, namely Moscow in the Soviet Union. Now, let's discuss the benefits of attacking each group one by one.

What are the benefits of attacking the British mainland? The answer to this question is the simplest. Du Fu's poem says, "To shoot a man, first shoot his horse; to capture bandits, first capture their chief," can explain this answer. Originally, these two lines of poetry are not very appropriate, because Britain is not the only hegemonic power in the League of Democracies. But in the eyes of the Germans, they believe that everything that is hostile to the Axis is instigated by Britain. If Britain is defeated, the League of Democracies will disintegrate. In addition, Britain is the leading figure among the great powers. If Britain is defeated, the victor can dominate the world. At least the Axis powers think so. Whether these two reasons are logical, we will temporarily reserve here. Here, we only temporarily assume that this is the benefit of the Germans attacking Britain.

Next, let's talk about what is the reason for attacking Gibraltar? Where are the benefits? The most obvious reason here is to break through the British blockade. Every time we hear the Germans say that the reason for launching this war is that the British are preparing to starve the Germans to death and block all German commercial activities. The most harmful blockade is in the Mediterranean, and the important gateway at the western end of the Mediterranean is Gibraltar. This is the reason for the Germans attacking Gibraltar.

So, what are the benefits of breaking through Gibraltar? First, it is obvious that the Mediterranean is the largest and strongest base for Britain. If you get this gateway at the western end, although you cannot "completely annihilate" all British warships in the Mediterranean, at least you have to force the British to quickly detour and escape as quickly as possible with their warships in the Mediterranean. Otherwise, these warships will become turtles in a jar.

In this way, the blockade is broken through, but where does it break through to? Africa? South America? Going to Africa is still possible, but going to South America may not be so easy; because the Atlantic Ocean is so far away, and the British and Americans have heavily deployed troops. But looking at the psychology of the Germans launching this war, it seems that they feel they are somewhat "omnipotent." They are invincible on land; although they are not as fierce at sea, those mysterious submarines and mysterious weapons seem to be very useful. Moreover, Italy still has a few ships left. After breaking the blockade at the western end of the Mediterranean, they can also come out and play. How do we know that the Germans don't want to try this?

As for going to Africa, that is naturally very convenient. First, in terms of combat, it is easy to transport troops to Libya; second, in terms of economy, you can use the products of French, Belgian, Italian, and other colonies. We see, maybe the Germans are too "wishful thinking"; but in the hearts of the Germans, they are not seriously doing it.

The above explains the rationale and benefits of the first group of offensives. Let's take a look at the second group. The second group has a total of three regions, namely the Caucasus, the Dardanelles, and Libya. In military terms, these three regions have three different rationales, but in economic terms, they only have one goal. Let's put aside the military and talk about the economic relationship first.

Looking at the map, the biggest purpose of attacking the Caucasus is that after success, the states of Iraq, Iran, etc. are within easy reach. Proceeding from the Dardanelles is also to enter other states in Asia Minor through Turkey. As for proceeding to Libya, it is the same as wanting to cross Egypt and pick up the infinite treasures of the Near East.

What is the situation in this so-called "Near East" Asia Minor region, and what treasures does it have?

This Near East region includes several countries; the most famous are Turkey and Arabia; Iraq (ie Mesopotamia), and Iran (ie Persia before 1935) have recently been in the limelight in the newspapers; there are also small Syria, Palestine, and the lesser heard but important Transjordan. In the eyes of the Germans, even Egypt and Afghanistan should be included.

The Germans have been coveting this land for more than a day. The reason for coveting is that both military and economic aspects are equally important. This Near East region is like a beautiful woman; militarily, this woman's heart has long been occupied by the British, and the Germans are staring blankly aside, inevitably arousing their jealousy. Moreover, with this woman, the British have streamlined communications, whether military or commercial. For example, in maritime and land transport, starting from the mainland, passing through the Mediterranean Sea to the Suez River, then turning into the Indian Ocean, and passing through India, Singapore, and reaching Australia. Or from Egypt to South Africa, turning to the Red Sea and entering Asia Minor, and then to India, Burma, Singapore, and Australia.

As for what is important in this region economically? In other words, what exactly is produced here that makes people willing to sacrifice and fight with their lives? The first is of course gasoline. This gasoline is equivalent to the blood vessels in the human body in military terms. The second is mineral products, in addition to iron ore, there are also very rich precious metal ores. In the basins of the Euphrates and Tigris rivers, there are also extremely abundant agricultural products. Other raw materials such as wool, cotton, and silk are also produced in large quantities here.

This area is not small. If Turkey and Egypt are counted together, it is almost the size of Europe outside the Soviet Union, and larger than India. The size of Egypt alone is equivalent to two Germanys.

Such a large area of land, with such abundant production, of course, is going to attract people to compete for it. Moreover, this sparsely populated place is a backward area in terms of material civilization, and because of different beliefs, different languages, and different races, there is no connection organization. Not only is there no connection organization, but they also deceive each other and do not conspire with each other, so it is easy for people to take action.

As for the German's coveting of this Near East region, there are still two important military keys. The first point is that if the Germans succeed here, cutting it off in the middle is equivalent to cutting the British territory connection line into two sections; the Mediterranean cannot stand, not to mention it; those lands of India and Australia will be like kites with broken strings, leaving them with no basis. The second point is that there is a tactic in marching called the "supply money"; in other words, that is, wherever the army goes, there must be supplies along the way. This does not only refer to the problem of military food, the most important are gasoline, coal, iron, and other items. Now marching, it comes to several thousand miles at a time. Is it always completely relying on transporting gasoline from the country to the front line for use? Of course, it is best to take from along the way, with local supplies, you can move forward. If there is nothing to take, that is cutting off the "supply line," which is the greatest taboo in marching. This is also a big reason why the Germans are eager to fly to the Near East.

The above explains the rationale and benefits of the second group of eastward offensives. There is also the third group of northward offensives left. There is nothing special about the northward offensive, but there are also two or three links that cannot be ignored, which are also worth explaining. (To be continued)

### Fierce Battles on the Kalinin Front; Eastern Front Warms Up, Ice and Snow Melt, German Army Engages in Consolidating Positions

Kuvshinov, April 4th, Reuters: In recent days, the most fierce battles have occurred on the Kalinin Front. The German army has launched several fierce counterattacks, all of which have been contained. The figures announced by the Soviet authorities indicate that the German side has suffered heavy losses. The Soviet official bulletin has now changed its style, often announcing that the Soviet army has carried out offensive operations in various places. Before this, for a period of time, the Soviet bulletin usually stated that there were no important changes in various places. According to various sources, the number of Soviet tanks participating in combat is increasing daily. Most of the tanks are used to assist the infantry and are not tasked with large-scale offensives. The Soviet army is still maintaining offensive pressure in many areas, which is of great importance. Although the ice and snow have melted, the German army still has no chance to withdraw some of its forces for rest or reorganization in preparation for a fierce offensive. On the contrary, according to the latest news, German troops must enter the front line for combat as soon as they arrive on the battle line.

Berlin, May 5th, Huitong News Agency: According to responsible sources here, the spring rain is continuous in the East, and the temperature has risen above freezing. The large-scale offensive of the Soviet army is not as fierce as before, but local offensives continue from time to time, and sometimes they are very fierce. The Axis army is now engaged in consolidating its positions in preparation for a major offensive in the spring.

German Side Announces Soviet Losses

Berlin, May 5th, Huitong News Agency: Huitong News Agency yesterday received the following supplementary information from responsible sources in the German military regarding yesterday's German war report: The Soviet army's losses in the first three months of this year, in addition to casualties, illnesses, and missing persons, also included 100,000 prisoners of war, so their total losses amounted to one million. From the beginning of the war to the end of March this year, the number of captured Soviet troops totaled 3,916,9938. Therefore, the total number of Soviet army losses is estimated to be 20 million. According to the 1,434,529 Russians in German prisoner-of-war camps during World War I, the Soviet army's loss of this number will have a great impact on future wars. The Soviet army's material losses are also very significant. Since the start of the war, a total of 23,712 tanks, 34,700 artillery pieces, and 20,476 aircraft have been lost. This loss cannot be supplemented by the Soviet Union's fragmented military industry. The Soviet army's desperate offensive on the Eastern Front has not only gained nothing, but has also suffered heavy losses. Therefore, the Soviet army's combat spirit is about to decline.

German Aircraft Attack Soviet Warships

German Headquarters, May 5th, Huitong News Agency: This afternoon, the Axis army war report stated that the enemy forces in the Central and Southern Routes of Eastern Europe launched attacks everywhere, but were all repelled. Three thousand enemy troops in the rear of the Central Route were wiped out. German fighters, dive bombers, and fighter-bombers assisted the army in combat on the Northern Route. The Soviet army suffered heavy losses. Forty-seven enemy aircraft were destroyed, and our aircraft only lost one. German aircraft attacked Soviet warships in the ports of Leningrad and Kronstadt. Two battleships and two heavy cruisers were hit. A mine-laying cruiser appeared to have been damaged. German heavy artillery bombarded the enemy's anti-aircraft positions. German fighters sank one merchant ship (2,200 tons) and heavily damaged five ships near the Fisherman's Peninsula and the coast of Murmansk.

Washington, April 4th, Reuters: According to military intelligence received here from various countries in recent days, Germany will launch a large-scale offensive along the entire Soviet front line from the Baltic Sea to the Black Sea. The purpose is to defeat the Soviet army. The German High Command has already assembled a large army of four million troops to plan this move, half of which are concentrated on the Central Route, with Moscow as the target of the offensive.

German dive bombers also dropped giant bombs on the ship's artillery and attacked and destroyed the anti-aircraft positions at the east entrance of the port. Several 1,000-kilogram bombs in the Valletta armory exploded with loud explosions and large fires. The factories and ordnance depots there were also hit by giant bombs.

London, April 4th, Havas News Agency: The Ministry of Aviation recently issued a bulletin stating that the airspace over Britain has been calm for several days, but today German aircraft flew to Britain again to drop bombs and bombard.

### Rent Committee of the French Concession to Handle Leasing Disputes Starting Tomorrow; Handled According to Regulations of the French Consulate General; Not Applicable to Subtenants

The Rent Committee established by the French Concession Municipal Council to handle issues between landlords and tenants within the concession will, starting Tuesday, handle cases according to the new appendices stipulated in Decree No. 89 of the French Consulate General. According to this decree, it is not applicable to subtenants, hotels, and apartments.

Sublease Licenses to be Reissued Tomorrow

Since the Donations and Taxes Department, Room 506 of the Municipal Council Building, and the Northwest and East District Offices began issuing sublease licenses for landlords on the 1st of this month, subtenants in the Public Concession have been enthusiastically obtaining licenses nearby. Starting from the 3rd, due to the Easter holiday, the department and district offices were closed. They will resume issuing licenses as usual starting tomorrow (the 7th). According to a report from the Datong News Agency, the Donations and Taxes Department of the Municipal Council, in order to alleviate the crowding of subtenants in the central district applying for licenses at the department, will, when reissuing licenses tomorrow, continue to open two windows at the bicycle license section opposite the Donations and Taxes Department to handle this licensing matter concurrently. The district offices will also appropriately increase staff to cope with the demand.

Licensing Hours Remain Unchanged

The Donations and Taxes Department of the Municipal Council and the district offices have issued a total of over two thousand sublease licenses (including sublease declaration forms and enamel license plates) in the past couple of days. It is speculated that when reissuance resumes tomorrow, the number of people will be even more crowded. The department's office hours are from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM and from 1:00 PM to 4:00 PM. Accounting must be completed after 3:00 PM. The licensing hours at the district offices are the same. Therefore, subtenants going to obtain licenses in the afternoon should go before 3:00 PM.

### Pudong Native Place Association Spring Sacrifice to Past Worthies

The Pudong Native Place Association on Avenue Edward VII held a public sacrifice to the past worthies of their hometown at 3:00 PM the day before yesterday. The ceremony was solemn, quiet, and orderly, following ancient rites. After the sacrifice, Mr. Zhu Buyi reported on financial matters and elaborated on the meaning of the public sacrifice in great detail. Subsequently, Mr. Ge Shuzhuang proposed that future sacrifices should involve all fellow villagers leading their nephews to participate together. At that time, eminent scholars should be invited to lecture, especially focusing on instilling in the younger generation the principles of personal conduct and social interaction for the future, so that the historically rich and simple customs of Pudong can be preserved. The participating business and industrial figures and celebrities expressed their agreement and were willing to advocate this within the Native Place Association.

### Transportation of Materials Requires Proof; Various Industries Forming Trade Unions; Approximately 30 Units Already Preparing

The city has now stipulated regulations for the transportation of important materials. Any merchant who wishes to move stockpiled goods must have the seal of the trade union affixed before the goods can be moved. Otherwise, once discovered, it will be treated as smuggling. It is understood that these measures are aimed at balancing the supply of goods and preventing profiteering merchants from illegally raising prices. All merchants in the city must not feign compliance or deliberately act covertly against the regulations. However, there are a total of five or six hundred trade associations in the city. Since the war, they have all been facing difficulties, leading to the de facto suspension of association affairs for several years. Now, with the urgent need to stabilize prices and revive the commercial market, various industries are actively forming trade unions. It is understood that in the past month, approximately 30 trade associations have been preparing, and others are still in progress.

### Registration of Bakeries and Steamed Bun Shops; Quantity of Flour Used

The Bakery and Steamed Bun Trade Association of this city issued a notice yesterday stating: "After this association requested the relevant authorities to find a way to supply flour to the major bakeries, steamed bun, and fried dough stick shops in the Hongxi District and Zhabei District of this city, we have now received notification that the authorities have approved and issued flour user registration forms. The authorities have designated the quantity of flour needed by the same industries in the above two districts. This association is responsible for initial registration. It is hoped that the same industries in the two districts will, starting today, fill out the registration form at No. 2, Lane 202, Guangxi Road, in order to compile the quantity of flour used and present it for allocation of flour."

### Distribution of Retail Cooking Oil to Increase by Half Starting Today; Retail Purchase Quantities Vary Among Oil Shops

Previously, the source of cooking oil was not smooth, resulting in demand exceeding supply. In order to distribute fairly and maintain order, merchants adopted measures similar to those used by rice shops, limiting each purchase to one yuan and queuing up during sales hours. Some even numbered customers or required the simultaneous purchase of soy sauce to prevent hoarding or reselling for profit. It is understood that the authorities are paying close attention to the source of daily necessities for citizens. Therefore, efforts have been made regarding cooking oil, and results have been achieved. As a result, wholesale cooking oil merchants will, starting today, increase the quantity of various cooking oils allocated to retail oil shops such as soy sauce shops and oil mills by 50% based on the original allocation. Therefore, it will be easier for ordinary citizens to purchase cooking oil in the future. However, the authorities still strongly hope that buyers will not hoard or resell for profit.

### French Concession Police Arrest Four Robbers

The French Concession Police received a tip-off at 11:00 AM the day before yesterday (the 4th) that two robbers were planning to rob a shop near the intersection of Route Ghisi and Avenue LaFayette. Chinese and foreign detectives were dispatched to the address and arrested the robbers Chen Qinghai and Zhao Dequan. According to their confession, two accomplices, Zhang Fugui and Zhu Shanjiang, were hiding at No. 1, Lane 108, Route Pellissier. Detectives went to arrest them, seized a pistol and two bullets, and took them to the police station for further questioning and investigation of the robbery leads, pending trial.

### Major Developments Expected in Million-Dollar Fraud Case; Diamond Sales Used as Pretext, Involving Wife of Prominent Russian Merchant

The jewelry merchant, Greek national, Xia Nazhai Lin, was recently accused by diamond merchant Balaibaxu and Bopiansiting, shareholder of the Didi Restaurant, of defrauding them of diamonds and cash amounting to a million yuan. This was briefly reported previously. It is heard that the case also involves the wife of a prominent Russian resident of Shanghai. Two hearings have already been held in the French Concession, but no decision has been made. The third hearing is scheduled for the 9th of this month, at which time a sensational development is expected.

Defense Lawyers

Three famous Shanghai lawyers have been hired by the plaintiffs and defendants to argue the case. The plaintiff, Bala Baxu, is represented by the famous Italian lawyer De Ni, who is accusing Xia Nazhai Lin of defrauding him of diamonds and cash totaling 250,000 yuan. The plaintiff, Bolun Siting, is represented by the French lawyer Plaime, who is accusing him of being defrauded of 850,000 yuan. The Russian woman involved in the case is the wife of Suleivishu, the general manager of Hongyun Shipping Bureau, the largest Russian merchant firm in the city. Because she had repeatedly signed documents guaranteeing the defendant Xia Nazhai Lin, she is also accused of conspiracy and has hired lawyer Feixielv to defend her. At the last hearing, the woman was released on bail of 100,000 yuan. Xia Nazhai Lin's lawyer, Xifqingke, requested bail at the last hearing, but it was denied, so he is still being detained by the French police.

Details of the Fraud

According to the French police report, Xia Nazhai Lin was first introduced to the plaintiff by Suleivishu's wife, claiming to be in the business of selling diamonds and needing financial assistance to start a large transaction. The two parties had several conversations at the Suleivishu's wife's residence. Xia Nazhai Lin claimed that he intended to buy diamonds on behalf of a wealthy Russian resident and take them to the United States for sale. At that time, the US exchange rate was very high, and both parties could obtain huge profits. However, after the diamonds were sold, they had to wait for the US remittance to arrive in Shanghai, so capital had to be prepared in advance. The plaintiff was moved by the huge profits and agreed, with Suleivishu's wife acting as guarantor, because Yefu Suleivishu was the Russian resident with the most assets in Shanghai, so there was no doubt about the wife's guarantee. A few months later, the Pacific War broke out. The plaintiff inquired with Xia Nazhai Lin about the situation. Xia Nazhai Lin suddenly said that the diamonds had been sold to a certain celebrity in this city and would definitely be paid at the agreed price. The plaintiff asked the celebrity for clarification and found that there was no such thing, and then realized that he had been deceived. He demanded compensation from Suleivishu's wife without success, and then reported to the French police, who arrested Xia Nazhai Lin.

### A Poor and Sick Man Had a Bizarre Idea: Borrowing a Lodging in an Empty Coffin; Groaning All Night, Startling Passersby

The Tongren Fuyuan Branch of the French Concession places empty board coffins next to the mortuary on Dadao, to be used for collecting corpses found on the road and unclaimed bodies in the mortuary. Recently, a rogue suffering from illness, because inns refused to lodge him, and he was also driven out of the neighborhood, had no place to rest his sick body, and had a bizarre idea: he came to borrow a lodging in this empty coffin. At night, passersby heard groaning from the coffin, and mistook it for a living corpse and ran away in fright. A brave, kind-hearted person came forward to investigate and finally understood the reason. This is also a living drama under the pressure of life.

### An Old Woman Succumbed to the Crush; Fatal Rice Purchase

Since the authorities have controlled food in the two concessions of this city, although the people's food has been stabilized, residents must rush to rice shops at dawn to queue and jostle for rice. However, because of the large number of people, the jostling is severe, and there are generally sick or elderly men and women who cannot withstand the squeezing of young people. As a result, their illnesses are aggravated, and some even die tragically. This has been seen many times. There is now an old woman from Fenghua, named Ye Ying, residing at No. 16, Quanyuli, Nanyangqiao, Avenue Henking. This year, she is fifty years old. The day before yesterday morning, she went out to buy rice, and because of her frail constitution, she was squeezed for nearly three hours and felt dizzy and unwell. It was not until 2:00 PM that she obtained one sheng of rice. She collapsed and lost consciousness upon returning home. Her family urgently reported to the police and sent her to the hospital, but she could not be saved. She died at 6:00 PM that day. The corpse was sent to the mortuary by the police. After an autopsy the next day, her son, Ye Shengguan, claimed the body for burial.

### West District Baojia System Ready; Wardens Install Tip Boxes

The Baojia matters in the West District have been largely completed since the establishment of the system. All streets and lanes have been organized into Lianbao offices, and wooden gates and alarm bells have been installed on the main roads to ensure security. Personnel have been transferred to form patrol teams, patrolling around the clock. It is also stipulated that if the head of each household encounters a change in household registration or population, they must immediately report to the relevant Jia head, who will then report to the Fang Gong Office for registration. Recently, a tip box has been installed at the door of each Bao head. If local residents encounter traces of bandits, they should report secretly at any time, so that the bandits have no way to succeed.

### Qingming Festival Coincides with Easter; A Rare Coincidence

Yesterday was March 5, 1942, according to the Western calendar, which is February 20th, according to the Chinese lunar calendar of the 31st year of the Republic of China. It was both the Qingming Festival and Easter Sunday for the Catholic, Christian, and Greek Orthodox religions. It was also the fourth day of Passover for the Hebrews (Jews), and the Japanese also commemorated the Spring Festival the following day. The spring festival of most people in the world happens to fall on the same day, which is a rare coincidence and can be said to be a grand gathering of spring festivals. Although the rituals for commemorating this most important festival of spring vary among different ethnic groups, the basic concept of welcoming spring and the renewal of all things is generally the same.

Whenever the Chinese people celebrate Qingming, seeing the earth return to spring and the scenery is bright and beautiful, they cannot help but think about where they come from. Therefore, every household is busy sweeping tombs and visiting graves, or the whole family holds a spring sacrifice at home to express their intention not to forget their ancestors. At the same time, they can also take the opportunity to travel and enjoy the beautiful spring scenery, so as not to disappoint the Creator's good intention to let humans relax their muscles and bones.

However, on the streets of this metropolis of Shanghai, no trace of the Chinese Qingming Festival can be found; only the windows of bakeries or candy stores are already displaying chocolate Easter eggs and rabbits. Although due to the difficulty in obtaining raw materials, they are not as eye-catching as in previous years, they have not disappeared completely. This year's Easter has this embellishment, and the foreigners in Shanghai can also be comforted.

Easter is commonly known as Foreign Qingming and must be on the first Sunday of the fourth month every year. Christians commemorate the resurrection of Jesus. In previous years, when foreigners in Shanghai encountered this festival, they drove and boated to travel to Hangzhou, Nanjing, Suzhou, Mount Putuo, and the suburbs of Shanghai with beautiful mountains and rivers for fun. This year, they cannot bear to look back. At most, they can only take a walk in the Jing'an Temple Road and Avenue Joffre area to spend this festival.

Easter, originally named Easter, evolved from the name Eostre Ostara of the Anglo-Saxon "Goddess of Spring". The white color used during Easter worship symbolizes joy, light, and purity. As for the Easter rabbit and egg, they are produced from superstitious legends. Legend has it that in a distant country in a certain era, there was a famine, and the parents were so poor that they could not afford to buy gifts for their children during Christmas, and they always felt guilty. In a blink of an eye, Easter was approaching again. In order to win the hearts of their children, they used eggs to paint colorful patterns and hid them in the woods. On Easter day, on the way home from church worship, the children played in the woods, and the colorful eggs were immediately discovered. At the same time, a rabbit jumped out from behind the tree, and the children were extremely happy and said that the colorful eggs must have been produced by the rabbit. This saying has been passed down for a long time, so every Easter, candy stores must have sugar-made rabbits and eggs on the market.

The White Russians who are living in Shanghai all believe in the Orthodox Church, and the most important religious festival is Easter. About four days before the festival, Russian families use eggs and butter to make a pagoda-shaped Easter cake and hold it up to ask the pastor for blessings. The Russian Easter custom is to say "Christ is Risen" to everyone they meet and kiss them three times. On Easter Saturday night, Russians go to the Orthodox Church on Avenue Henri Cernuschi to worship, and then go home with a burning candle. If the candle does not go out when they arrive home, it is said that they can have good luck. However, in the heavy wind and rain like the night before last, if you hold a candle home, I am afraid that none will not be extinguished. (Min)

### Robbery of 320,000 Yuan; Police Search for Clues; Suspect's Unlicensed Car Similar to One Found, but Not Confirmed

The unprecedented robbery in Shanghai recently occurred on the morning of the 16th of January, at around 7:00 AM, when four employees, including Chen Wenquan and Guo Chengyi, of Shenzhuang Tianbao, Jinfeng, and Shicheng, were carrying 323,000 yuan in legal tender in three small suitcases from Nanjing to Shanghai. They hired rickshaws and, while passing near No. 306, North Henan Road, were robbed of all the above-mentioned property by six or seven bandits.

Escaping in Different Directions

Following confidential reports from informants, the Hongkou and Huishi police stations arrested Wu Xiaobao, the wife of the deceased robber Liu Xiao Bazhi, as well as the suspects Xu Rushui and Xu Ajin, Jiangbei residents, and Jiangbei women Wei Zhangshi, Jiang Wangshi, Xu Yangshi, Zhang Liushi, and Xu Zhushi, who were hiding the legal tender, and the male and female suspects Zhu Da Sizhi and others, totaling sixteen people. The Huishi police station recovered 11,400 yuan in legal tender, and the Hongkou police station recovered 51,000 yuan, approximately one-fifth of the stolen money. The remaining large sum of legal tender was taken out of Shanghai by the leaders of the robbery, Xiao Junzi and Liu Rubiao, and others.

Fleeing Far Away

Their whereabouts are unknown, they live in seclusion, and there are no clues to be found. During the court hearing, the plaintiff did not send a representative to identify the evidence. The police did not find any other cases against the defendants. The matter was dismissed after questioning. A representative from the plaintiff's side, surnamed Li, stated that according to the staff escorting the money to Shanghai at the time, the leader of the bandits was sitting in a chartered car, which stopped them. The other bandits rushed forward, pulled out pistols, and dragged the three suitcases on the staff's rickshaws into No. 306, North Henan Road, and robbed them. According to the defendant Xu Ajin, at that time, there was indeed

### Ningbo Shipping Schedule Set; May Be Temporarily Changed; Prohibition of Liquor and Fruit from Shanghai to Ningbo; Wenzhou Passengers Transfer to Ningbo to Return Home

The Huning Navigation Company's Manager Hualin Wheel is scheduled to sail to Ningbo on the afternoon of the 6th of this month. The Huawan Wheel is scheduled for the 7th. Although the schedules have been arranged, they may be changed due to temporary reasons. All losses will be borne by the passengers.

Prohibition of Liquor and Tobacco

Recently, it has been heard that passengers returning to their hometowns sometimes carry merchandise, liquor, tobacco, fruit, and other items in their luggage. Such items have always been prohibited. It is hoped that all passengers returning to their hometowns will pay attention to avoid confiscation and losses.

Ships Come and Go

The Changshan Maru of the East Asia Shipping Company sailed to Ningbo from the Taikoo Wharf yesterday afternoon, with more than 400 passengers. It is heard that more than ten of them are Wenzhou passengers transferring to Ningbo and Jinhua to return to their hometowns. It is heard that the Naruto Maru will sail to Ningbo again on the afternoon of the 7th of this month. It is heard that tickets for that ship have already been sold out.

Crowded Ticket Purchases

Because there are very few ships traveling between Shanghai and Ningbo, and there are many passengers returning to Ningbo from Shanghai on each ship, there are many people vying to purchase tickets for each ship. A small number of unemployed fellow villagers have exhausted their travel expenses because they could not buy tickets and have no way to return to their hometowns. Therefore, it is hoped that the shipping authorities will increase the number of ships as necessary and improve the ticket purchase methods.

Chartered Car

Those sitting inside were unknown. This car was a chartered unlicensed car hired by Liu Rubiao, who is on the run. It was a purple copper leaf and black car. The police saw a chartered car in the defendant Xu Changsong's car shop. It was a white copper leaf and black car body. It is impossible to prove whether it was the car he usually sat in. The staff members of the plaintiff's side will identify and verify it again.

### Low Pressure Moves to Sea; Weather Clear and Cold; Yesterday's Temperature Approximately 50 Degrees

According to a report from the Datong News Agency to the Xujiahui Observatory, the weather in this city was affected by the low pressure approaching Shanghai's surroundings. The minimum temperature the day before yesterday fell to 58.1 degrees. Yesterday's temperature was even lower, only about 50 degrees, and the northwest wind blew tightly all day long, as if it were in the middle of winter. At dawn yesterday, due to the low pressure passing over Shanghai and moving east to the sea, there were strong winds and heavy showers. In the afternoon, as the low pressure moved further away from Shanghai, the weather began to be clear and cold, but the wind was still strong and the cold was not dispelled. Due to the drastic changes in climate in the past two days, the number of corpses found on the road has increased sharply. According to statistics released by the Pushan Villa, it collected 84 corpses on the road, large and small, on the 1st of this month, 98 on the 2nd, 93 on the 3rd, and 107 on the 4th. As of the time of publication yesterday, the statistics were not included because the body transport car had not yet returned.

### The True Meaning of Walking (Part 1)

— Yu Xinen

The advancement of the times has tended toward a state of artificial fabrication, increasingly distancing us from nature day by day. People no longer need the sunshine and ultraviolet rays of nature, and are also too lazy to run outdoors to accept this gift that is so beneficial to the human body. You only need to hide in the room, press the electric button, and sun lamps, quartz lamps, and red lamps can be used at any time. This is indeed the most convenient and the most modern. This is just one example. How many things do not have the same code of benefits?

Natural Style Irrelevant to Status

It is not just a matter of substitution, it can simply be said that human power can surpass nature. Tropical plants will not grow in other areas, but in the winter botanical gardens of London, tropical plants will grow and thrive in the same way. This is human power surpassing nature, at least the temperature and humidity can be controlled as naturally as possible.

However, human affairs are changing and cannot be constant and unchanging, which is a pity compared to nature. When human power loses its effectiveness, "nature" still maintains its constant and unchanging original effect and style, but it is not pretentious, extortionate, or hoarding, and is always so benevolent, gentle, and fair.

Today, due to the changes of the times, it is a fortunate thing that nature can once again show its greatness. If the current stops or coal is lacking, sun lamps and purple light lamps will immediately become useless and lose their value. The sunshine and ultraviolet rays in nature will not be lacking but are permanent, and are supplied in the same way in any era, which is an inexhaustible treasure.

Transportation Occasionally Fails

In today's big cities, major means of transportation immediately lose their effectiveness due to the lack of fuel. This is not surprising, because it is artificial, and the defect of the artificial is that it cannot be permanent, how can it be unchanged for thousands of years? Fortunately, once the artificial is lost, there is still "nature" that can be used, and the natural ability that was once despised is being respected again.

Indeed, in the past, in the prosperous era of transportation, if you used walking to replace a car, your dignity would be completely lost. No matter what reason you defend, no one will care. But today, walking has become a major means of transportation, and it is so needed that there is no need to defend it.

### Municipal Council to Work Tomorrow; Bureau Rice to be Allocated Today

The rice shops in the two concessions obtained transportation permits from the Municipal Council Rice Grain Office on the morning of the day before yesterday (Saturday). The rice from the warehouses that was shipped out on that day was not completely shipped, and the rice warehouse was closed on Sunday yesterday. It must be picked up today. Therefore, although the rice shops will still ship out foreign rice today, the sales situation will be difficult to be widespread. It will be more widely sold on the day after tomorrow (Wednesday). Although the Rice Grain Office is temporarily open this morning during the Easter holiday, it will issue corn permits for rice shops to pick up corn from Lihe Warehouse at No. 195 Suzhou Road for sale on Friday. It will officially resume work tomorrow (the 7th). The Flour Office will not be open this morning and will resume flour allocation tomorrow. In addition to allocating flour, the office has also been processing corn applications since the 1st of this month. The dates for the two concession rice shops to ship out foreign rice this week are still Monday, Wednesday, and Saturday. Corn will be sold on Friday, and the quantity limit has not changed. Flour is also being continuously opened and extracted to provide various goods for flour product merchants to manufacture.

### Two Robberies Yesterday

At 8:30 AM yesterday, six robbers broke into No. 510, Avenue Eduard VII. One of the robbers pulled out a gun to intimidate and robbed a lot of property. The robbers were about to escape when the American shouted for the police. Nearby Chinese police rushed to the scene and arrested a robber, seizing a pistol and two bullets, and taking them to the police station for interrogation.

At 9:20 PM last night, three armed robbers broke into No. 8, Yufang, Shantou Road, and robbed 200 yuan in legal tender and 50 yuan in Japanese military notes.

### Carrying Opium; Seized at Iron Gate

Yu Wentao, a local resident of A, Juyeda Road, 37 years old, bought two liang of opium at Laomiao in the South City the day before yesterday afternoon and hid it in his pocket. When he passed through the Dongxinqiao Iron Gate, he was caught by the patrol police stationed there. The police seized the opium and took him to the police station. According to Yu's confession, the opium was bought back for his old mother to smoke and was not for sale. The police chief ordered him to be detained.

Yesterday's broadcast time was 6:30 PM.

### Qingming Festival

— Liu Tang

"During the Qingming season, rain falls in torrents, travelers on the road are in despair." Unexpectedly, this year's Qingming corresponds precisely to these two lines of Tang poetry.

The day before yesterday was Hanshi Festival, yesterday was Qingming, the wind and rain made it dark and gloomy, truly not very "Qingming" (clear and bright). Some say this is the appropriate weather for the season; otherwise, how could it correspond to the times?

Regarding Qingming and Hanshi Festival, previous and current people have written extensively; there's no need to say more. But I remember that in my childhood, every Hanshi Festival, we would go to the countryside to break off willow branches, wrap them in handkerchiefs, and cluster the leaves into a ball, calling it "Yang Husun" (willow monkey). Yesterday, passing by the Gu Family Garden, I saw someone holding one, and couldn't help but recall the scenes of my boyhood. Looking back, my hair is already gray. Time flies like a fleeting glimpse of a horse through a crack, it is indeed true.

In my hometown, once Qingming passes, we gradually enter the preparation period for farming. Therefore, we particularly value the night before Qingming, calling it "cooked food night." "Cooked food" probably still carries the meaning of Hanshi, not lighting fires, hence eating cooked food, and going to bed early. There's a saying: "On cooked food night, it's good to go to sleep early," used to mock the young daughter-in-laws of oppressed classes in old families, who would go to bed before it even got dark. Nowadays, in the countryside, both oil and candles are expensive and scarce, so the custom of going to bed early has become widespread. Even in places with electric lights, people suffer from expensive electricity bills and can't afford them, so many learn from the villagers and go to bed early. Lazy daughters-in-law long for early dusk; now it's the same everywhere, how delightful!

The custom of sweeping tombs during Qingming, I don't know when it started. Some believe that during the Qin and Han dynasties, emperors began to have gardens and mausoleums. After Wei Wudi's death, the officials followed the Han system and established a sacrificial hall above the mausoleum. Emperor Wen believed that "ancient sacrifices were not made at tombs, but all were set up in temples." Qi Wang Fang, during his nine years in power, went to Gaoping Mausoleum once, and Cao Shuang was executed, so the ritual was abolished. Sima Yi then left a will that neither his children nor officials could visit the mausoleum. It was not until the death of Emperor Yuan of the Eastern Jin Dynasty that there was a ritual of visiting the mausoleum to bid farewell. As for the common people, I believe that the sacrifice between Dongguo Jun's tombs, although not called tomb sacrifice, is close to tomb sacrifice. And since the ancients had the practice of repairing tombs, how could we know that there was no ritual of sacrifice? During the Eastern Han Dynasty, meritorious officials were all ordered to return to their hometowns to repair their tombs; this was not uncommon. For example, Feng Yi was allowed to return home to repair his tomb, and the Grand Master of the Palace was sent with wine and meat, and the prefects and commandants within two hundred li and the clansmen were ordered to attend. Cen Peng was also ordered to return to Jin Township to repair his tomb. When Wu Han pacified Shu and returned with his troops, he sailed down the river to Wan, and immediately ordered to return home to repair his tomb, and was given 20,000 hu of grain. It can be seen that repairing tombs and returning to one's hometown in fine clothes and ornamentation were the same as when a man succeeds in life, glorifying his ancestors. When Zhou Taizu was dying, he repeatedly told Chai Shizong, "If there is nothing to do every Hanshi Festival, you should assign someone to sweep and clean the tomb. If no one goes, just offer sacrifices." This shows even more that by the Song Dynasty, the custom of offering sacrifices and sweeping tombs during Qingming was practiced by all levels of society.

The custom of burning paper money when sweeping tombs, regarding the origin of paper money, according to Ming Dynasty Du Mu's "Ting Yu Ji Tan":

"Now, in the homes of scholars and commoners, whenever there is a funeral, sacrificial offerings of dishes and fruits are placed before the coffin seat, made of earth or wood, whatever one pleases, and decorated with colors. In sacrifices, paper money, as well as gold and silver paper ingots, must be burned, and paper money is also made with gold and silver. Tao Gu's "Qing Yi Lu" records that the sacrificial offerings of dishes and fruits before Zhou Taizu were all carved from incense, with lifelike shapes and colors. So, these sacrificial offerings already existed during the Five Dynasties. The Tang Shu, Wang Ying's biography, records that since the Han Dynasty, all funerals have used funerary money. Later generations gradually used paper money to represent money for ghosts. It was then used for sacrifices, so the burning of paper money in sacrifices probably began during the Sui Dynasty. The father's records say that on the day of Zhou Shizong's funeral procession, gold, silver, money, and treasures were all represented in shape, and the paper money was as large as a teacup. The printed text said, 'Treasure of the Spring Terrace,' in yellow, and 'Dark Travel Treasure,' in white. So, gold and silver paper ingots and money also began in the Nine Dynasties."

It is said that Zhou Taizu was frugal and had seen the eighteen Tang tombs being excavated because of extravagant burials, even Zhaoling's solidity (Tang Taizong's tomb) could not avoid it. Therefore, before his death, he repeatedly told Chai Shizong to be buried in paper clothes and a tile coffin, without a stele, only engraving a stone with the words "Great Zhou Emperor," and not to have palace women guarding the mausoleum. No emperor in ancient times was as earnest about simple burials as Zhou Taizu. I believe that the saying of reincarnation after death began to flourish after Buddhism entered China. Therefore, I suspect that after the Six Dynasties, various legends of hell infiltrated into the folk, causing people to seek blessings in the afterlife and to pay for salvation, which was not uncommon in the histories of the Eight Dynasties, the Five Dynasties, the Tang, and the Song. Wang Shouyi was just a sorcerer! During the Tang Xuanzong's reign, he was appointed as the Sacrificial Envoy, specializing in sacrificing to resolve the emperor's intentions. Wang Anshi was indeed a genius of his time, but when he was seriously ill, he ordered Taoists to perform rituals and display a large amount of paper money. His younger brother, Pingfu, said, "Brother, you are in a high position and must set an example for the world. Although you are ill, praying to the hills has been going on for a long time; what good will this do? Moreover, you have always used the laws of the ruler to punish corrupt officials; now you are seeking blessings with paper money. How can you know that the Three Pure Ones will not enforce the laws of the ruler!" Anshi was furious. From this, it can be seen that when human power cannot solve a problem, praying to heaven and begging for help from the gods is nothing more than seeking a kind of comfort in the spirit. However, the same prayer is ridiculed as superstition, which is truly as the ancient saying goes, "People suffer from not knowing themselves." Whenever a person is blinded by material desires, factionalism, or the distinction between benefits and harms, they are already no longer human, it is quite common.

Paper money is usually made of what is called "four-six screen paper" on the market. It is popular in the north and less so in the south. In Jiangsu and Zhejiang, tin foil ingots are mostly used, and paper ingots are rarely used, and paper money is even rarer. Before August 13, Shanghai used Fuyang straw paper for cleaning purposes. When the source of Fuyang straw paper became scarce, the four-six screen paper originally used for paper money in the north also replaced straw paper and was consumed in latrines and gardens. Since the price of tin is expensive, the price of tin foil is even more expensive, so some people have begun to use "foreign tin foil" as a substitute, but the sales are not very wide. When paper currency spread all over the world, the national bank notes of their country were produced in due course. Believers in ghosts should say that yin and yang are consistent. Therefore, if the yang world has it, the underworld will imitate it even more. The poison of paper money has reached the heavens and the earth, in all directions, reaching everywhere.

Those who believe in Jesus take the first Sunday in April as Easter, The Resurrection. It is said that Jesus was nailed to the cross on Good Friday, the first Friday of April, and resurrected on Sunday. The Chinese call it the "foreign Qingming," because Qingming Festival does not fall on April 5th or 6th, it is just close to it. Foreign merchants must take holidays at this time. The financial power of Shanghai has long become a situation of "holding the Tai'a sword upside down" (usurping power). Therefore, when foreign merchant banks take a holiday, Chinese merchant banks often follow suit and also have a tomb-sweeping holiday. It is called tomb-sweeping to show that it follows Chinese customs and is different from Western customs. Schools also set the week starting from April 1st as spring break, which is the Qingming holiday of the old-style schools. Regardless of whether it is Easter, tomb-sweeping holiday, spring break, or Qingming Festival holiday, the purpose is the same: to use the holiday to enjoy the spring scenery.

Tomorrow, I will go spring outing. The practice of spring outing has been around for a long time; it doesn't have to be just for Qingming. When Confucius' disciples expressed their aspirations, Zeng Dian said, "In late spring, when the spring clothes are ready, I would like to go with five or six adults and six or seven children, bathing in the Yi River, enjoying the breeze on the altar of dance, and returning home singing." Confucius sighed and said, "I agree with Dian." Qingming is the solar term in the third month of the lunar calendar, which is indeed late spring.

Not to mention that Master Confucius approved of it as a common aspiration, we later generations, putting ourselves in that situation, the nurturing of the spring breeze is directly in line with the heaven and earth and all things, not rigidly adhering to the ends of things, how great it is.

### Seminary Sunday Worship

The Sunday worship at Shanghai Seminary is usually presided over by the four pastors of the academy: Lin Daoliang, Zhou Zhiyu, Zhao Shiguang, and Feng Jieguang. Recently, since moving to the China Inland Mission on Xinzha Road, the number of attendees has increased, so that there are no empty seats every Sunday. Most of the churches in this city use the Shanghai dialect, and there are very few national language services. Shanghai Seminary uses the national language for preaching, which is a good opportunity for believers who do not understand the Shanghai dialect to attend worship.

### The Dance of Money

— Xiao Wen

"The times have changed," the old man said with a sigh; and young people no longer enjoy nutrition. Some time ago, a friend would ask me to go to the milk shop every three to five days; but now, he says that taking a walk is more beneficial to health than milk.

Along the way, we talked about money and the philosophy of using money, but what a sad philosophy it is. It is said that if you have money, it is better to use it up quickly, because cruel time not only takes away your youth and life, but it also silently devours the banknotes in your pocket. My friend originally wanted to buy a pair of machines, but he procrastinated for a few days. When he remembered to buy them again, he could only buy one.

I said that one day, coming out of a store, I jumped on a tram and paid for a ticket, but it was said to be unusable. But it had only been in my hands for less than five minutes, and as the tram drove past, I saw that the bank that issued the "unusable" banknotes was still open and doing well. But I'm not surprised.

Although most people have become thinner under the dance of money, some people have become fatter.

They buy and sell, flipping back and forth. Tonight they "dream of killing pigs" (Monsanto), tomorrow they dance with "Phoenixes" (matches). "Solid capital" in hand gets "Gao Le" (High Life). Although they love "Fairies" (Fairbanks), they are not afraid of "Arrow Knives" (Arrow Collars). So, after picking and choosing, the banknotes increase. People also get fatter.

And I remember a mysterious legend about magic: a person picks at a few coins in his left hand with his right hand, and as he picks, the coins increase. It is said that a misfortune, such as blindness, lameness, or fewer children, must be used as the price for learning this magic.

Aren't those who are good at dancing with long sleeves also playing a kind of magic, a terrible magic? They gain more money under the dance of money, but I wonder if they remember, or if they know, that they must also pay a price like those who pick at copper coins -- a more unfortunate price.

### The Heart of Patience

— Huang Wenjin

Patience -- a mixture of moral courage and real fear -- the firmness of the heart is to use delicate emotions to overwhelm rough emotions, and to use concepts to overwhelm vague feelings. Before this authority of the will, quirks, tendencies, and habits all sweep away like dead leaves in the north wind.

Some people say that the human heart should be like a pool of quiet and pure water; that way, it will not be angry before slander, not rejoice before pleasure, not be alarmed before danger, and have no likes or dislikes in daily life. But, can a person without patience do that?

Marcus Aurelius Antoninus of Rome said, "Whatever happens, don't worry about whether you have the strength to deal with it. If you do, do your best and don't boast; if you don't, don't complain, because although the burden is heavy on you, it will also destroy itself." Then, silently doing everything that can and cannot be done should be the goal of patience.

The great British writer Thomas Carlyle lent the original manuscript of "The French Revolution" to a friend to read before it was published; unexpectedly, the friend's servant thought it was a roll of waste paper and took it out and burned it while cleaning the room. Ah! What a serious blow this was. Carlyle had to write this painstaking work all over again. But, he did not let his friend know his wounded heart, and instead said to his wife, "We must conceal it and not let him see the severity of this matter." In a mood of frustration, one day, he saw a plasterer building a high wall by the roadside, patiently stacking bricks one by one. "Look," he said to himself with determination, "Since this plasterer can perseveringly do this delicate thing, how can't I rewrite 'The French Revolution' again?" As a result, he did complete this famous work.

Pascal has a saying: "People should avoid being troubled by anything, and do everything with the psychology of all things supreme. I think this is a responsibility, and not practicing it is no different from committing a crime." You see, this sentence was thoroughly done by Carlyle.

Indeed, patience is hard work, but its fruit is sweet; a person lacking patience is like a lamp without oil that cannot shine. Do you know of any famous person whose lamp does not have this oil?

Patience can accomplish things that we cannot do with our strength. It is like a brilliant flower, but it does not grow in the gardens of ordinary people. Let us hope that this iron seedling sprouts in the field of suffering!

### A Bald Head's Boon -- Wigs

— Ba Du

When people pass middle age, their hair gradually turns from gray to white. This is a natural trend, there is no need to worry about it, and no method can be used to save it.

But baldness is different. Many men who have not yet reached forty are often bald, shining brightly, which, although not a big problem, is still easy to attract people's attention, and it is inevitably a defect in appearance. Therefore, wigs have become the only boon for this kind of people.

Making wigs is a specialized skill. It is considered a master if someone can wear a wig on their head and people cannot tell the truth from the false.

Ira Senz, a wig-making expert at the New York Metropolitan Opera Company, is one of the masters in this field. The wigs on the heads of many big shots in film companies and famous cabaret stars are mostly made by him.

One of his customers is a university professor, dignified and maintains considerable dignity. He had a set of wigs made, with different densities, each with its own use. He changes them at any time during the year, but the sharp-eyed students have never discovered the truth.

According to Senz, the most important thing in making a wig that can make people unable to tell the truth from the false is to mix the wig well with the bald person's own real hair, and weave them into a flesh-colored, finely made hair braid. After combing and brushing according to the person's natural hair style, it will not be easily detected.

Before making a wig, the head of the person who is having it made must first be modeled with plaster to create a wooden blank, and then a soft paper is used to make a scalp according to the wooden blank. Then, a hair braid -- very delicate and not easy to see -- is woven according to the fake scalp. Finally, the model is removed, and fine steel needles are used to secure the person's hair on this scalp net, while knotting them so that they do not come off.

After the wig net is made, it is trimmed and combed by an experienced barber, and it is exactly the same as the person's real hair.

If the wig is worn on the head, will it reveal its true colors during strenuous exercise or when a strong wind blows? This will never happen, because inside the wig, there is a double-sided adhesive. Moreover, when wearing the wig, as long as you dip some alcohol glue on the outer edge of the hair braid and press it with a towel, it will stick firmly to the skin. Afterwards, even wearing a tight hat or even swimming in the water will not be a problem.

It only takes five minutes to wear a wig, and it is especially simple to take it off. Just apply some acetic acid, and the stickiness of the alcohol glue will dissolve. The wig can also be rinsed, just like real hair on the head. Senz's customers are not limited to men. If there are famous women who also wear wigs, his youngest customer is a five-year-old girl, with golden hair like silk, and no one can tell that it is fake!

Psychology

### Superstitions about Sleep

— Da Fen

Sleep has always been a mystery, and primitive people are even more filled with superstitious legends about it. They believe that sleep is when a person's soul leaves the body to wander in another realm. For example, the Indians of Brazil always say that their souls will go hunting, fishing, logging, etc. after waking up. Some natives say that the soul will visit their ancestors. But the natives of Bali believe that they go to play in the gardens of the gods.

The thieves of Java have a more peculiar view. They believe that the soil of tombs has an incredible hypnotic effect, so before they visit people's homes, they first scatter a circle of tomb soil around the house, so that they can act at will and not worry about being caught.

The residents of Halmahera Island dare not sleep in a place where someone died the night before, because they are afraid that the spirit of the dead will borrow the corpse to return to life when it comes back. Therefore, some primitive people do not like to suddenly wake up a sleeping person, for fear that their soul will not have time to suddenly return. The position of a sleeping person is also very important, and must not be moved, otherwise the soul will inevitably sigh that it cannot find its body to enter, and the person will inevitably be in danger of losing their soul. Of course, there are also many legends about dreams, and they are all interpreted in the same way. Some Indians believe that dreaming of the moon and bears is ominous, as they symbolize revenge, while dreaming of eagles is very good. British women often rush to consult dream dictionaries when they wake up in the morning.

Some people also spare no effort to study the direction of the bed. Some say that the head of the bed should face south, while others say that it should face east and west. The head of the bed facing north is still a popular legend, because "the current flows from the North Pole to the South Pole," so the body must also be in a straight line with the current.

It is said that the great British writer Dickens always carried a compass when traveling, in order to check whether the head of the bed was facing north. And the villagers of England believe that they should face the church when sleeping.

But, what exactly is sleep? Many experts have studied it, but there are many different opinions, and there is still no generally accepted answer.

### Sharing the Same Boat

— He Jia Zhi

(III) Guests Arrive

The next day was the day of Mrs. Ye's funeral. All of the Ye family's relatives and friends came. The gunners kept firing cannons, the musicians kept playing music. Looking in from the bamboo fence, there was a vast expanse of white. Funerals could not be as energetic as weddings. The people who were assigned to entertain the guests were either telling people about the deceased's illness with a bitter face, or drooping their heads and looking dejected and depressed. External matters were asked of Li Youxie; internal matters were asked of Mrs. Ye the Second. Li Youxie and Mrs. Ye the Second were both people with an excess of tears, but now, in order to help with the big event, they were deprived of the opportunity to cry. In the morning, starting from Weicheng, everyone put on mourning clothes before Mrs. Ye's spirit. Then, Wei Yunqing and Qin Runzhi came as mourning guests. Wei Yunqing was still wearing the same outfit as yesterday, only without the broken tiles and bricks in his lapel. He not only came to mourn, but also to eat, and not only to eat, but also to escort Mrs. Ye's spirit robe.

Li Youxie was extremely busy. Qin Runzhi also grabbed his sleeve, talking about Miss Wei's marriage. Li Youxie was a little annoyed with him, saying, "We're not talking about this matter now." Qin Runzhi smiled, "Not talking about it is knowing not to talk about it, but Young Master Ye is at a disadvantage. Young Master Ye is an upright person, but he's at a disadvantage that he can hit his head on." After a while, more and more mourners arrived, both men and women. This was because the Ye family of Shide Hall was a prominent family; moreover, the customs of the countryside were such that neighbors, front and back villages, went in groups to eat next to the well-to-do, and they did not feel any shame at all. That Qin Runzhi, in the midst of his busy schedule, grabbed Li Youxie's arm again, saying, "Mr. Li, a word in your ear." Li Youxie was really a little disgusted with him. Qin Runzhi said in a low voice, "Mr. Li, turn your head and look. That woman wearing a cheongsam as red as a rose, with a flower pinned on the left side of her hair, that girl is Miss Wei. Take a look and tell me if she's beautiful. She came first to attend the funeral, and second to let your uncle see her, maybe there's a chance to salvage things." Li Youxie turned his head to take a look, and said, "Forget it, forget it. What's there to talk about now? When the time comes, we have to enshroud her immediately." Li Youxie gave an order, and the musicians, earthworkers, carpenters, and painters were all very busy; Weicheng cried until he couldn't catch his breath. All the relatives and friends were gathered in the main hall, looking at Mrs. Ye's last appearance. Unexpectedly, a person rushed straight in from outside the door, shouting loudly, "Wait! Wait! Spare her life!" That voice was like a spring thunder. (42)

Invention

### Pedal Ambulance

— Zhang Qiao

Recently, someone invented a pedal ambulance. The wounded soldier lies on a stretcher with two wheels, and then the stretcher is connected to a bicycle, so that the wounded soldier can be transported to the field hospital. This method is very suitable in places where gasoline is scarce; at the same time, it saves more time and effort than a stretcher.
