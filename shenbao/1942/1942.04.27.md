### German Parliament Convened Yesterday, Hitler Delivered a Speech, Declaring Continued Warfare in Eastern Europe, Retaliation for British Air Raids, German Parliament Passes Resolution Granting Hitler Special Powers of Appointment and Dismissal

Berlin, 26th (Haitong News Agency) - Official sources here announced this morning that the German Parliament convened at 3:00 PM today.

Berlin, 27th (Urgent Telegram from Nong Haitong News Agency) - Führer Hitler delivered a speech to the Parliament, which lasted for an hour. Speaker of Parliament, General Göring, moved to empower the Führer to conscript any German citizen, order them to devote their utmost loyalty, and dismiss those who disobey or fail in their duties at any time. After the Speaker proposed this motion, it was immediately approved and unanimously passed.

Berlin, 26th (Urgent Telegram from Haitong News Agency) - At the beginning of his speech, Führer Hitler pointed out that in his speech to Parliament on December 11th of last year, he summarized the major disasters of the past year. The significant impact of these disasters may not be fully understood until hundreds of years later. After the suppression of the Belgrade rebellion incited by England and the Soviet Union, Europeans began to understand the threat from the East (Soviet Union). The world was forced into war in September 1939, and people began to understand the truth of the causes of the bloody conflict. On September 3rd of that year, England and France, disregarding Germany's efforts to maintain peace, declared war on Germany, and England and France led Poland to the fuse. England and France also created the catastrophe for humanity. Hitler declared that the war in Eastern Europe would continue. We are determined to destroy the Red Army. History will show whether victory in the winter war ultimately belongs to the attackers who disregard human life and blindly sacrifice, or to the defenders who conserve their strength. Hitler pointed out that the production of German submarines has increased sharply, and in the future, dealing with British submarines will be even more active. Hitler mentioned the atrocities of British aircraft bombing German civilians, saying that retaliatory strikes will be taken in the future, and the precedent of 1940 can serve as proof. Hitler requested Parliament to grant him the power to adjust German citizens at any time, order them to do their best to fulfill their responsibilities, and punish those who disobey at any time. Hitler analyzed the points of conflict of interest between the belligerent countries, saying that one side is defending the legitimate rights of its own people, while the other is a puppet of international parasitic Jews. Hitler revealed that the German forces fighting in Eastern Europe have even better and stronger armaments.

Berlin, 26th (Haitong News Agency) - The German people are eagerly awaiting the German government's statement in Parliament this afternoon. The news of the German Parliament convening was only broadcast by radio to various places this morning, and was not published in this morning's newspapers, which caused general surprise. The last session of the German Parliament was held on December 11, 1941, after the United States entered the war. At that time, the Führer delivered a speech, announcing that Germany, Italy, and Japan would jointly fight against Britain and the United States until final victory. Later, the Führer delivered a speech once on January 30, the anniversary of the Nazi Party's assumption of power, pointing out that Germany would be able to achieve even greater victories this year. The German government's re-issuance of a statement this time has naturally attracted attention from all parties.

### The U.S. Sets Trade Conference for Next Month, Fifth, and Has Already Drafted a Broad Plan to Control National Economic Life

Washington, 25th (Havas News Agency) - Commerce Secretary Jones, on the order of President Roosevelt, has convened representatives of the federal government and state authorities to participate in a trade conference on May 5th. The conference is tentatively scheduled for three days. The invitations signed by the President have already been distributed to the state governors and informed of the main agenda, which is to study how to eliminate shipping restrictions between states and other commercial obstacles that "hinder the war effort." In addition, President Roosevelt has also scheduled to submit a message to Congress on the 27th. The draft has already been prepared, but it is said that the message will be broadcast nationwide at that time, and a speech will be delivered separately.

Washington, 25th (Havas News Agency) - It has been learned that the government has decided to issue an order next Tuesday to "freeze" all prices in order to prevent inflation. It is heard that the government has drafted a broad plan to control national economic life, and freezing prices is one of the steps set out in it. In addition, the Price Administration has also promulgated regulations regarding the stabilization of export prices, stipulating that export prices should be based on cost, plus a semi-average profit from July 1, 1940, to December 31, and should not exceed this limit.

### The U.S. Shipbuilding Plan Is Still Difficult to Fully Implement

Berlin, 25th (Havas News Agency) - U.S. President Roosevelt told the press yesterday that the shipbuilding plan would be difficult to fully implement for the time being due to the insufficient supply of copper plates. Political figures here are paying close attention to this, saying that England's launching of the current war was all due to Roosevelt's admission that the United States would be a "democratic arsenal." But in practice, the United States cannot complete its naval shipbuilding plan, which Roosevelt himself has admitted. England's hope of winning the war relies entirely on the United States supplying munitions, and its future is even gloomier, which goes without saying. Therefore, Roosevelt's remarks are really worth pondering. In addition, the New York Times recently published a shocking article, recording the activities of the Communist Party in the American schools in New York, and warning the U.S. authorities to prevent the Bolshevik crisis. In England, its "Empire Review" magazine also published an article, severely criticizing the administration of the British Empire. All these points can prove that the internal situation in the United States and Britain is difficult, and there are few solutions.

### Egypt Establishes More Ambassadors, Both Parties Can Decide

Chongqing, 26th (Reuters News Agency) - An agreement has been reached with the Egyptian government here to exchange ambassadors, and the candidates have been decided.

### New Zealand

Recently, New Zealand Prime Minister Fraser confirmed that New Zealand and its island territories, including the Lian Fei Qi Islands, have been designated as a region called the South Pacific Region. New Zealand is located southeast of the Australian continent. Its main body is the North and South Islands, and its terrain is like a long boot. The North Island is the lower part of the boot; the northernmost end is a flat peninsula, and the southern end is mountainous, with many volcanoes and hot springs. The South Island is the upper part of the boot, with a range of high mountains on the west side, called the Southern Alps, with many high peaks and glaciers. The coastline is still developed, especially the northern end of the North Island. The Cook Strait is between the two islands and is a waterway for ships.

### New Caledonia, U.S. Announces Troop Landing, Island Currently Ruled by Tegor, France and Canada Reportedly to Sever Diplomatic Relations

Washington, 25th (Havas News Agency) - The War Department recently issued a communiqué stating, "With the consent of the authorities of the French New Caledonia in the southwestern Pacific, U.S. troops have arrived on the island to participate in defense work." New Caledonia is located 1,600 miles east of the Commonwealth of Australia, with a total population of approximately 54,000.

New York, 25th (Havas News Agency) - The New York Times reported that France and Canada may sever diplomatic relations within the next week. It is understood that the United States will not take the same steps, but if there are new developments in the situation that force the United States to revise its current policy towards France, then that will be another matter. As for the other staff of the embassy in Vichy after Ambassador Lee Hsi returned home, they will still remain in Vichy, because maintaining diplomatic relations between the United States and France can keep communication between the United States and France open, which is beneficial.

New York, 26th (Reuters News Agency) - The French Consul at Diqurote in the United States, Langet, has resigned after Laval became the head of the French government. Yanflai, the acting agent of the French Consulate, has also resigned.

Berlin, 25th (Havas News Agency) - According to an official announcement from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Slovak State, the French government has legally recognized the state and has asked the state's envoy to Germany to inform its government.

### U.S. and Peru Sign Commercial Treaty

Washington, 25th (Havas) - Agriculture Secretary Vegaard recently stated that the United States has signed a commercial treaty with Peru, stipulating that the United States will purchase more than 200,000 bales of cotton from Peru each year during the war. The Peruvian government will always cooperate with the United States to reduce the production of excess cotton. Some parties here believe that this commercial treaty is the first step towards controlling international cotton harvests and may have significant consequences, because this plan will not only be implemented during the war, but will continue to be promoted after the war in order to limit production, standardize prices, and balance supply and demand. It is heard that the U.S. government is currently negotiating the same agreement with Brazil.

### Paraguayan President Orders Dissolution of the Liberal Party

### Nine. Temples and Architecture of India (Part 1)

Indian art, with its unique splendor in the cultural history of the world, is well known to all, mainly because India is the birthplace of Buddhism, and Buddhist art is unique. The most magnificent and grand of Indian art is architecture, unparalleled in the world. The author is a layman in Indian architecture, and now, based on what I have learned from reading, I will briefly summarize it to append to the end of the special issue. I am not presumptuous, but also intend to elicit valuable opinions.

Ancient Buildings in the Area of the Dead

Indian culture is generally believed to have been created by the Indo-Aryans. It has a long history. Even architectural art is unlikely to be an exception, because the history before the Indo-Aryans is unknown, which is indeed inevitable. However, with the passage of time and the development of science, in the past ten years or so, the history of Indian culture, thanks to the efforts of archaeologists, has been advanced to thousands of years before the Indo-Aryans. The subsequent development has not yet been limited, so the cultural historians of various countries in the world may have a major shift in their views on India.

India has an archaeological bureau, headed by Marshall (Sir. John Marshall), who is engaged in the excavation of ancient sites throughout India and has achieved remarkable results. About ten years ago, he excavated the ruins of an ancient city in Mohenjo-daro, which was a relic of 5,000 years ago, which was even more amazing. His contribution to the academic world is extremely significant. Mohenjo-daro means "Area of the Dead" and was originally just a few piles of desolate mounds covered with weeds. Its high point had a Buddhist ruin. The place was indeed as the name suggests, uninhabited for a long time, but the broken bricks in the soil in the surrounding wilderness attracted the attention of archaeologists, and they dug under the pagoda and obtained an unprecedented discovery. What was discovered was a city from the Copper and Stone Age. The most important of these about architecture were reservoirs, ditches, wells, bathrooms, and streets. As for ancient seals, ancient pottery, and ancient decorations, there were also many, all of which could confirm that they were objects from 5,000 years ago. Here, I will only talk about architecture.

The reservoir was made of fire-resistant bricks, 39 feet long and 23 feet wide, in a rectangular shape, built in the center of a huge building. There was a platform around the reservoir. There were originally arches around the platform, all enclosed within the walls. As for the construction of the reservoir itself, it was extremely ingenious. When laying bricks, it was known to apply gypsum asphalt, which is even more impressive. The pool walls were also polished to make them shiny. The arrangement of the bricks in the pool bed was also very neat. There was a huge staircase at each of the north and south ends of the pool, so it led into the pool. The pool bed gradually sloped towards the northwest, so it led the water into a huge ditch. As for how the water was introduced and the function of the reservoir, it is still not clear.

The system of ditches is also most worthy of attention. The first part is long enough for a person to stand upright without hindrance. The ditch was originally covered with wooden planks, and the ditch bed was paved with bricks. At the other end of the top, there are holes opened for people to enter and exit regularly to do cleaning work. Later, the ditch shape gradually became lower and narrower, and entered a winding passage. There are many ditches in the streets, all parallel to each other, or with two or three ditches, and all leading into the main ditch. For water at high places, mud pipes were used to dredge it. There are private wells and public wells, which are set at a corner of the street or outside its edge. The well is paved with bricks and connected to a ditch, and its shape is very similar to Chinese wells. The bathroom architecture is also good, similar to a brick-built small well, surrounded by walls.

The main streets of the area of the dead run from south to north in parallel lines, and the small lanes are made at the right corner of the streets. In this way, the houses are located in one side, and the street plan is like the most modern American city today, which is also amazing.

There were no corridors or gardens, and the courtyards were very small. The houses were mostly two stories high, with separate stairs, showing that two families lived in one house. The population in this city must have been very large, and the social organization must have been good, which can be asserted.

Based on the relics of the area of the dead, the Indo-Aryans called their ancestors "black charcoal." Who knew that their civilization was far superior to the self-proclaimed victors, the Indo-Aryans. When Smith's Indian seal was discovered, Waddell (L.A. Waddell) had already claimed that Indian culture originated from Sumer. Now, the excavation of the area of the dead has made the theory that Indian culture was created by the Indo-Aryans shake, which is undoubtedly true.

A Brief Account of Buddhist Architecture

The most grateful Indian architecture for the world is Buddhist architecture, not only for the bewilderment of art, but also with religious meaning. However, the buildings created by Sakyamuni when he was alive have not been left behind. The Buddhist buildings that exist are mostly built by later generations, such as the Great Temple of Gaya, the place where Sakyamuni attained enlightenment, which was rebuilt by Burmese monks in the fourteenth century and greatly repaired by the Indian government in 1884. It is 160 feet high and can be seen from seven miles away. The oldest of the existing relics are the stone pillars of King Ashoka and the Songxi Pagoda.

The Ashoka stone pillars are relics from around 250 BC. They are round pillars with a bell-shaped top, surrounded by wheel-shaped patterns, and a lion sits on top of them. The pillar body is engraved with Ashoka's edict. The total height is 32 feet 9 and a half inches, the diameter of the base is 35 inches cattle, and the diameter of the top is 26 inches father a quarter. Its intention, style, and technique are all unique to India. The lion's posture is strong and solid, and it is enough to see the greatness of the ancient Indian art. There are still three similar commemorative stone pillars, which will not be fully described now.

### In the Area of Dunkirk, Northern France, Intense Air Battles Between Germany and Britain; Many Docks and Factories Bombed

London, 26th - Reuters - The Air Ministry announced that British planes had launched six large-scale offensives within eleven hours yesterday. The combat zone stretched 250 miles from Dunkirk to Cherbourg. Near Abbeville, a large number of German fighter planes engaged in aerial combat, marking the first such large-scale engagement this year. The intensity of the fighting was unprecedented since the start of the war.

London, 26th - Reuters - The Air Ministry announced last night: "Our planes launched a large-scale offensive in northern France today. In the morning, several squadrons of fighters escorted many Boston bombers to attack the ports of Cherbourg and Dunkirk, bombing several docks. They also escorted Whirlwind bombers to attack a factory in Calais. Five German fighter planes were shot down over Dunkirk. In the afternoon, a squadron of Boston bombers, escorted by fighters, attacked the ports of Le Havre and Abbeville, bombing docks and train yards. Several aerial battles occurred with German planes, and three were shot down. One of our bombers and fifteen fighters are missing."

London, 26th - Reuters - In addition to attacking Rostock in the Baltic Sea last night, the British Air Force also bombed the Skoda armaments factory in Czechoslovakia. This was the third time British planes had bombed Europe's second-largest armaments factory. The first time was in October 1940, on the 22nd anniversary of Czech independence. Only a small number of bombers participated in the raid at that time.

Fire in Rostock

London, 26th - Reuters - According to reports, the British Air Force's second attack on Rostock, Germany, was as successful as the first. The Heinkel aircraft factory, located one or two miles north of the city, was bombed by airmen, who glimpsed a raging fire. Several areas of the port also caught fire, burning brightly. Many coastal stacks were engulfed in flames. A British plane flew as low as 1,000 feet for reconnaissance. However, the city was shrouded in thick smoke, and searchlights could not penetrate it. The famous German Heinkel aircraft factory is large in scale, with many factory buildings occupying an area almost equal to the old city's site. The current attack targeted the largest of these factories. Each factory cooperates, with smaller factories specializing in manufacturing components, and larger factories assembling them into aircraft. The main factory can produce six Heinkel fighters, bombers, and seaplanes daily, and has its own airfield, runways, and seaplane slipways, the length of which exceeds that of other airfields.

London, 26th - Reuters - British bombers attacked Rostock, Germany, on the Baltic coast for the third consecutive night last night (Saturday). British heavy bombers also attacked the Skoda factory in Pilsen, Bohemia. According to the British Air Ministry this morning, Rostock and the Hengel aircraft factory were bombed by a large number of British planes last night. Another squadron of heavy bombers attacked various targets in southern Germany and the Skoda factory in Pilsen. The docks in Dunkirk were also bombed. British fighters attacked German airfields in occupied France at night. The round trip for British planes to attack Pilsen was 1,400 miles. The Skoda factory there is the second-largest armaments factory in Europe, and this was the second time it had been bombed by the British Air Force. The first time was in October 1940, when a small squadron of British planes braved bad weather to attack. Regarding the activities of British and German planes last night, responsible parties stated that the main target of the German planes was the Bath area.

Large numbers of troops have been continuously deployed and concentrated near the front lines in order to participate in the decisive battle. In the southern sector, the road surfaces are slightly drier than in the central and northern sectors, so the majority of troops are concentrated there. According to Soviet estimates, there are currently about 26 German armored and motorized divisions participating in the Eastern Front. The Red Army is accelerating the transportation of large numbers of reserve troops from Siberia and Central Asia to Europe. For several weeks, the German Air Force has been wantonly bombing Soviet railways, which proves that the Red Army is concentrating large forces. At the same time, the battles in several areas of the front line have gradually become more intense. The Red Army's western vanguard has launched attacks on German forces in the Leningrad, Belorussia, and Smolensk regions. Large-scale battles are also taking place along the Svir River in Finland.

It was immediately decided to establish an Economic Committee, headed by Minister Without Portfolio Romier. The food supply issue was the main topic of discussion at today's Cabinet meeting. Minister of Food Supply Le Roy Ladurie and Deputy Minister of Food Supply Bonnathus reported on the difficulties currently being encountered, the most important of which is the bread supply issue, which should be resolved first. Chief Laval also stressed that the bread ration should be maintained at its current level, and that any further reduction would create a crisis, as the national population is already undernourished.

Vichy, 25th - Havas News Agency - The new cabinet convened its second state council meeting at 10:30 this morning to discuss internal affairs. It is reported that almost all the time was spent discussing food supply matters, indicating that the government attaches great importance to this matter. Although the authorities have taken various measures in recent years to increase agricultural production and adjust food distribution, the fact is that the French people are still undernourished. This situation is well known to all parties, and a solution must be found immediately, otherwise the future of the French nation will be unimaginable. Specifically, the British blockade, the lack of domestic labor, the decline in livestock, the activities of the black market, the food requisition by the occupying forces, and even the overly detailed current regulations are all factors that hinder the normal supply of food and make the food shortage even more acute. Since the armistice, a ration system has been implemented for staple foods such as bread, fats, and meat. Under the current circumstances, it is of course impossible to change this system. However, the Vichy press believes that there is room for improvement in the distribution of other essential goods, such as poultry, vegetables, and fresh fruits. According to reliable sources, the government's current plan, while not completely allowing the free flow of all foods, will at least give farmers greater freedom in disposing of their products. In short, the government authorities are currently considering two issues: one is how to increase production, which will take time, and the other is how to unseal the food reserves that the government sealed a year ago. If the latter is implemented, the current ration of food allocated to the people can be appropriately increased. However, the fundamental solution lies in waiting for this year's autumn harvest.

Vichy, 25th - Havas News Agency - Marshal Pétain received Minister of Food Supply Le Roy Ladurie and Chairman of the Farmers' Association Guebryon today and made inquiries.

### Second Group of French Children Arrives in Geneva

Swiss Capital, 26th - Havas News Agency - The second group of French children arrived in Geneva yesterday to be adopted by Swiss families. As a result, the number of French children adopted by Swiss families has now reached 4,000, of which 2,300 are from occupied France.

### Turkey Strengthens National Defense; Government to Request Appropriations

Istanbul, 26th - Havas News Agency - The government will request an appropriation of 30 million Turkish pounds from the next parliament to strengthen border defense.

Istanbul, 26th - Huitong News Agency - The Turkish government has now decided to participate in the International Administrative Conference to be held in Berlin in early May. It is reported that the Turkish delegation will be led by Professor Bacher.

### Norway's Oldest Newspaper, Bergen Evening News, Ceases Publication

### Addressing the India Problem with Intelligence and Patience; Nehru's Statement; Cripps to Report on Visit to India

New Delhi, 26th - Reuters - Indian National Congress leader Nehru stated today while meeting with reporters that we do not intend to make representations to the British government, but will do our best to address our problems with intelligence and patience. If Cripps believes that his trip to India has improved the situation, then he is greatly mistaken. Cripps said that we evade responsibility. Such an accusation is truly strange, because the responsibility we seek is actually denied. The British government still speaks in the tone of its pre-war protector, and tries to show the world that it is the arbitrator of India, which surprised me greatly. Nehru expressed surprise at the resolution passed by the Madras Provincial National Congress Legislative Assembly at its meeting the day before, not only about the content of the resolution, but also about the fact that the former Madras Province Prime Minister Charlie used his position as a member of the Standing Committee of the National Congress to preside over the meeting. It is said that this kind of action is inappropriate at any time, and it is especially inappropriate on the eve of the opening of the All-India National Congress Standing Committee. According to reports, the motion put forward by Charlie, which was passed by the Standing Committee of the province, suggested that the All-India National Congress Standing Committee should recognize the Muslim League's demand for the division of India in future constitutional making. The resolution also suggested that the All-India National Congress Standing Committee should invite the Muslim League to discuss in order to reach an agreement and promote the establishment of a national government to deal with the current emergency situation.

Saigon, 26th - Huitong News Agency - According to news from Calcutta, Indian Congress Party leader Nehru issued a statement to the press yesterday stating that Indian leaders do not intend to resume negotiations with the British government at this time. This statement was in response to Cripps' statement after returning to England that Indian leaders were prepared to resume negotiations with the British government. The remarks made by Cripps do not correspond to the facts, because the situation in India has not improved slightly due to Cripps' visit.

Bangkok, 26th - Huitong News Agency - According to Madras news, Indian Mahatma Gandhi will meet with Madras Premier Rajagopalachari, before the All-India Conference on Wednesday in Allahabad. Lai has already gone to Wada to visit Gandhi.

New Delhi, 25th - Havas News Agency

It is reported that the Indian government will soon have the power to requisition various movable and immovable properties. This power will also be extended to the provincial governments. As for the property of various religious groups, it should be exempt, unless the provincial government deems it necessary for the defense of India or for public security and the convenience of war operations.

London, 25th - Havas News Agency - When the upper and lower houses meet next week, Sir Cripps will attend in person to report on his trip to India. In addition, the Duke of Devonshire and the Lord Chancellor Simon will also speak on behalf of the government in the House of Lords.

### Head of the French Shipping Company Goes to Saigon to Plan Shanghai-Vietnam Navigation Methods; New Far East General Manager Arrives in Haiphong to Inspect the Situation

International shipping in this city has been completely suspended. Even the small ships flying German and Italian flags on coastal routes have already stopped sailing. Recently, the German merchant ship "Lunhai Fu" has been renamed, and the "Moufou" and "Hana" have similar plans. The various situations have been reported in previous newspapers.

Efforts are Being Made to Open Navigation Routes

Efforts are still being made to open the Shanghai-Vietnam route. However, due to the increasing Pacific War, it has not been possible to open the route temporarily. In addition, the manager of the Saigon head office was arrested due to certain circumstances, and the position of Far East General Manager is vacant. The Marseilles head office ordered the manager of the French Shipping Company in this city to take on the position concurrently. The manager took the S.S. G.G.A. Varenne to Saigon to take over the position of Far East General Manager and to proceed with opening the Shanghai-Vietnam route. It is reported that the ship has now arrived in Haiphong. The manager is inspecting the branch office in Haiphong, and will take the original ship to Saigon in a few days. If the negotiations are successful, the Shanghai-Vietnam route can be successfully opened in the future.

### Purchasing Opium for Medical Use Exposed; Hospital Director Flees

Gao Mouming, director of the Jisheng Hospital at No. 1 Card Road, Xiangfuli, ordered trainee Yu Jianrong (15 years old) to purchase opium in the southern city for medical use. However, yesterday at around 5 p.m., Yu was apprehended by Chinese police when he passed the iron gate of Dongxinqiao Street. He was taken to the police station and confessed that Gao was the instigator. The police went to arrest Gao, but he had already fled upon hearing the news. The police chief ordered Yu to be detained pending further investigation.

### Rice Sales to Be Supervised by Police Chiefs

It has been heard that the French Concession Authority, in order to prevent unfortunate incidents from occurring to rice buyers, has instructed the police chiefs of each police station to personally inspect the rice stores on the days when rice is sold to prevent all disputes.

Cheap Coal Supply Unreliable, Water Prices Rise Again; Cooked Water Shops Close Down

More than 540 cooked water shops in this city were able to barely maintain their operations because they purchased cheap coal dust for cooking water. However, since December 8th of last year, the Kai'ao Mining Bureau has stopped operations in reality. The supply of cheap coal dust has also stopped. The cooked water shops have switched to purchasing commercial coal dust, which has posed a serious threat to their operations for several months. Moreover, these businesses are all small-scale. Now that the water company is also increasing its prices, the businesses are unable to maintain their operations. More than a dozen have been forced to close down one after another. The closure of cooked water shops has a significant impact on social problems. Currently, the industry association is still actively seeking to continue selling cheap coal dust and other important issues, and hopes that the relevant authorities will provide assistance.

### Passengers Departing Shanghai for Ningbo Find Ferry Transfer Troublesome; Hope for Direct Boarding on the Bund

The Dongya Shipping Company's Changshan Maru departed from Taikoo Wharf on the afternoon of the 21st of this month and arrived safely at the Jiangbei coast of Ningbo around noon the next day. After unloading passengers and cargo, it handled the return voyage. The ship has now returned to Shanghai and is scheduled to depart for Ningbo for the sixth time yesterday at noon. The ship is very crowded on each trip. The reason for this is that passengers parked at Taikoo Wharf do not need to use small ferries for transfer, and can directly board the ship. Therefore, passengers going to Ningbo are willing to take this ship to avoid twists and turns. Recently, there have been many people returning to Ningbo from Shanghai. However, due to the lack of convenient transportation, people from the same village urgently hope that the relevant authorities will find ways to improve it, so that traveling back and forth can benefit all. For example, Hualin, Haitong, Wanjin, and others are usually parked at the Yangshupu Yangzi Wharf, and the transfer from the Bund by small ferry is troublesome. Passengers hope that the above-mentioned ships can be changed to moor near the Bund to facilitate boarding and avoid the labor of transferring by ferry.

### Group Returnees Numbering Over Two Hundred Can Apply for Sponsorship; Efforts to Secure Shipping Cabin Space at Half Price; Various Organizations Continue to Issue Return Certificates

Although yesterday was Sunday, the Shanghai Municipal Council's office for issuing return permits and its various sub-offices still issued return permits as usual. The number of applicants was quite large. Starting on May 1st, although the office and its various sub-offices stopped issuing half-price tickets, they still issued return permits as usual. The hometown associations and social organizations entrusted to issue return permits also continued to issue permits to facilitate those applying to return to their hometowns.

Hubei Villagers Group Registration

The Chinese Evacuation Association has requested 200 half-price cabin spaces from the Dongya Shipping Company for a commercial ship that will sail to Hankou tomorrow or the day after, in order to reduce the burden on Hubei villagers and facilitate evacuation. Hubei villagers who do not need to stay in Shanghai can apply to the Hubei Shanghai Villagers Association to board. Do not miss this good opportunity.

Future Application Can Be Made by Imitation

In the future, if there are people leaving Shanghai to return to their hometowns in the same destination, such as those over two hundred people, they can request the Shanghai Municipal Council's Chinese Evacuation Association to transfer to the authorities requesting ships to reserve half-price seats, and get a group to take care of each other, but also to lighten travel expenses.

### Showing the Severity of Living Problems from the Cost of Living Index: An Eighteen-Fold Increase Compared to Five Years Ago, Rickshaws Now Classified as Luxury Items

The soaring cost of living in Shanghai in recent years is unprecedented. All residents, except for the wealthy, lament the difficulty of making ends meet. Ordinary citizens relying on low wages live in constant worry. Employers often claim that salaries have increased several times over, implying generosity and blaming individuals for not being thrifty. However, in reality, the increase in wages cannot keep up with the skyrocketing prices, like a tortoise trying to outrun a hare. Ordinary citizens are like swallowing Coptis chinensis – they have bitterness they cannot express, struggling to support even their wives and children. Helplessly, they scatter their families back to their hometowns (assuming there is still a home), while they remain in Shanghai to struggle. Even if they are mocked by relatives and neighbors for returning empty-handed after years in the "land of gold," Shanghai, they cannot afford to care.

New Cost of Living Index Reaches a Peak Again

The upward trend of living expenses in Shanghai roughly began at the end of the lunar year before the last and has continued relentlessly. In recent months, the situation has changed dramatically, with the price increases being even more shocking, to the point where ordinary citizens can barely survive. Even with rapid salary adjustments, it is not enough. This can be clearly seen from the figures released by the Shanghai Municipal Council's Statistics Office. The new cost of living index for Chinese workers in Shanghai for March of this year, published in the Municipal Council Gazette on the 24th of this month, reached a new peak of 1781.60. This is calculated with the 1936 cost of living index set at 100, showing an increase of 30.67% compared to February. It is clear that the current cost of living index has increased approximately 18 times compared to 1936, meaning that one yuan today is only worth 5.61 fen in 1936. The cost of living index for Western salaried employees is 791.46, an increase of 24.08% compared to 782.95 in February, with one yuan being worth 10.29%. (Note: The Municipal Council's published salary index for Westerners also uses 1936 as the base for comparison.)

A Hundred Yuan in Your Pocket Now Only Worth Five and a Half Yuan

In short, these figures indicate that if you had 100 yuan in your pocket six years ago, you now only have five and a half yuan. The remaining 94.5 yuan has been lost invisibly due to the high cost of living. For foreigners, 90 yuan has been lost invisibly. However, this is based on the situation in March. If calculated based on today's new peak in prices, the index has risen at least another 30% compared to March. A detailed analysis of the cost of living index is provided below.

First, let's consider Chinese workers. The average household unit has 5.02 people, accounting for 4.4 consumer units. The proportion of household income is 66.20% from the main wage earner, 23.29% from other family members, and 10.51% from other household income. If the entire household earned 100 yuan in 1936, they now only earn 405 yuan, with the lowest earning only 343 yuan. Comparing this figure with the expenditure table shows that the goods this household unit can now afford for living are only one-fifth of what they could afford six years ago. If this household wants to maintain the same standard of living as before, they must earn approximately 1,800 yuan per month. However, the current average actual earnings are only 373 yuan, so how can they not be struggling?

The largest item of living expenses is "food." Rangoon rice sells for 223.464 yuan per picul (currently selling for 290 yuan). In 1936, it only sold for 9.735 yuan. Moreover, the rice priced at 223.464 yuan per picul is of very low quality. The rice price in the free market is about double that amount. The second largest expense is "housing." Current rent is six times higher than in 1936. Landlords receive little of it, with most of it going into the hands of second landlords. They are solely profit-driven, openly defying regulations prohibiting rent increases, repeatedly using excuses to raise rents, disregarding the benevolent intentions of the lawmakers. The social saying "Landlords should not oppress the poor" has long been completely destroyed. Other expenses, such as electricity, are less under the management of municipal authorities. Clothing is 15 times more expensive than in 1936, and fuel is about 20 to 40 times more expensive.

Foreigners Also Experiencing Financial Difficulties

As for the cost of living index for foreigners, a simplified table is listed below: (Based on the average index of 100 in 1936 for comparison)

The rate of increase in food in March compared to 1936 was 11 times for American residents, 13 times for British residents, 16 times for Russian residents, and 14.5 times for other foreign residents. Rent was 6 and 1/3 times for American residents, 6 and 1/5 times for British residents, 6 and 2/3 times for Russian residents, and 5 and 2/3 times for other foreign residents. Clothing was 11 and 1/3 times for American residents, 11.5 times for British residents, 11 times for Russian residents, and 11.5 times for other foreign residents. Miscellaneous items were 5 and 2/3 times for American residents, 5 and 1/4 times for British residents, 6 times for Russian residents, and 6 and 1/3 times for other foreign residents. Looking at the numbers above, the expenses for rent and miscellaneous items are lower than those for food and clothing. Rent is subject to some control, but most of the rent is still earned by second landlords. Miscellaneous items include public transportation, trams, and telephone fees, which are also subject to strict control by municipal authorities. At least rickshaws are now classified as luxury goods and are not included in these calculations.

Medium Living Expenses Require Over 2,000 Yuan

The numbers listed above are all based on those published by the Municipal Council. A further analysis of the living expenses of middle-class Chinese and foreign citizens is provided below:

Chinese family, calculated for ten people, March 1942

Food: 1,500 yuan

Housing: 300 yuan

Clothing: 300 yuan

Miscellaneous: 200 yuan

Entertainment: 200 yuan

Total: 2,500 yuan

(April may increase by 30% compared to this number)

Foreign family, calculated for five people, March 1942

Food: 1,200 yuan

Housing: 600 yuan

Clothing: 1,200 yuan

Miscellaneous: 600 yuan

Entertainment: 400 yuan

Total: 4,000 yuan

(April may increase by 30% compared to this number)

In the past, the cost of living index was rarely noticed except by those who studied it, because life was stable, and the index fluctuated very little, making it seem uninteresting. But today, it is a matter of personal survival, and ordinary citizens will carefully examine the cost of living index. Therefore, this article with its lengthy statistics may still arouse the interest of readers. However, wealthy people, through successful hoarding and speculation, accumulate more and more capital, and the rising cost of living does not affect them. No matter how much the cost of living index increases, it seems to have nothing to do with them. Only the vast majority of ordinary people suffer, lacking both capital and assistance. They can only allow the burden of living to become heavier and heavier. Unable to cope, those who commit suicide and those who freeze to death on the roadside are everywhere. Ordinary people are innocent; it seems they should not be subjected to such cruel treatment!

### Low Pressure Hits Shanghai, Climate Changes, West Wind Blows Furiously, Showers Pour Down, Weather Expected to Stabilize Today

The weather in this city suddenly changed yesterday. The west wind roared, showers poured down, and clouds leaped and swirled all day as the atmospheric pressure dropped. The Universal News Agency reporter records the following:

Wind and Rain Together

The weather in this city has been unsettled with alternating sunshine and rain in recent days, but the atmospheric pressure has been stable. Starting yesterday morning, the weather suddenly changed. The west wind blew furiously, with a force of over three. Dense layered clouds gathered and leaped threateningly. At 10:00 AM, a sudden shower fell, lasting for half an hour before stopping. The weather was unstable in the afternoon with alternating sunshine and rain. At 5:00 PM in the evening, thunderstorms continued.

Low Pressure Leaves the Sea

Yesterday's strong winds and heavy rain seemed to be affected by a low-pressure system moving towards Shanghai from the Yangtze River basin. It is generally expected that it will pass over Shanghai and out to sea last night, and the wind is expected to stabilize today. However, whether it will clear up is difficult to say.

### Rice Shops in Both Concessions to Collect Corn Sales Permits Today

Although yesterday was Sunday, the warehouses designated by the Municipal Council's Grain Office to extract rice from Jardine Matheson's, Zhejiang Xingye's, Huishan's, Roosevelt's, and other wharves were open as usual to allow rice shops to extract rice. However, it has not been fully extracted, so the door-to-door sales situation today will not be as widespread as on Wednesday. Today, following the usual practice, they will collect sales permits from the Municipal Council's Grain Management Committee and then pay at the Grain Office. Starting tomorrow, they will begin extracting corn from Lihe Warehouse at 195 Suzhou Road. This corn has been ground into coarse grains and will be widely available for sale on Friday. The time for rice shops to sell rice will continue to be extended.

### Shanghai Dredging Bureau Invites Bids for Machine Oil and Cleaning Materials

The Shanghai Dredging Bureau announced that it is now inviting bids for "water-based fuel oil," machine oil, cleaning materials, tools, and miscellaneous materials, to be delivered according to the Bureau's instructions. All details and lists can be obtained from the Luogong Section of the Bureau on the 5th floor of the Jianghai Customs (special attention should be paid to the first item on the list). Bids must be sealed securely, with the words "Bid for Materials" written on the outside. The letter should also state the manufacturers of each item and must be delivered before noon on May 1st of this year. When bids are opened in the future, the Bureau is not bound by the lowest or any bid and may assign the contract to any bidder.

### Protecting Rice Transportation Organizations, Intercepting Rice Along the Way, The Incident of Rice Trucks Collapsing in the Yunhui District Being Intercepted Due to the Issue of Increasing Protection Fees

The Shanghai Municipal Council issues foreign rice to each rice shop on Monday, Wednesday, and Saturday every week. Recently, the transportation of this foreign rice in the Yunhui District north of the Bund has been contracted to the Huatai Transportation Company of Yunnan Road. During the designated period, the rice is loaded and shipped from each warehouse, and the collapsers are given armbands as proof to pass through.

Huatai Company's Rice Truck Crosses the Bridge

On the afternoon of March 20, Huatai Company's collapsers Xu Guohong, Wang Yi, and others, a total of ten people, loaded a large amount of foreign rice from a certain warehouse to supply the people for purchase the next day, Saturday. When they passed North Suzhou Road, they were surrounded by several strong men upon the order of Shi Changfa, the Jiangbei manager of the Shuangyi Company at No. 49 nearby.

Municipal Council-Issued Armbands Also Robbed

Claiming that the Municipal Council armbands worn by you collapsers are forged and cannot transport foreign rice, they forcibly removed them and took them away. The workers were greatly shocked and reported it to the shareholder and manager of the local area, Cui Conglai, who went to negotiate with Shi Changfa. In fact, Shuangyi Company specializes in protecting the transportation of Municipal Council's foreign rice to prevent starving people from robbing it along the way. Initially, Huatai Company was willing to pay a fee of one and a half cents per bag.

Demanding a Protection Fee of One Dime Per Bag

Since the 16th of last month, they wanted to increase the price to one dime. All foreign rice vehicles passing through the North Suzhou River Wharf, except those of Huatai Company, were treated in the same way. These people are quite influential, taking this protection fee. Otherwise, the rice trucks loaded along the way are at risk of being robbed by bandits and starving people. Cui Conglai was very dissatisfied with Shi Changfa of Shuangyi Company and secretly reported it to the Yunhui Police Station. After the West Detective and senior Chinese officers rushed to Shuangyi Company to investigate,

The Bureau Sues for Obstructing Rice Transport

The company manager Shi Changfa, as well as the suspects Jiangbei resident Jiang Agen and Ding Jinfa, who forcibly took the armbands of the collapsers at the North Suzhou River Wharf at that time, were taken to the police station and prosecuted for obstructing the transport of grain and fraud under Article 250, Paragraph 1, of the Criminal Law. According to Cui Conglai, shareholder and manager of Huatai Transportation Company, the defendant Shi Changfa is quite intimidating in the North Suzhou River Wharf area. According to Shi's testimony, he did not forcibly increase a fixed protection fee and hired a lawyer to defend him. The other defendants all denied participating in the forced seizure of the armbands issued by the Municipal Council to the collapsers.

### Rickshaw Passengers Robbed on the Bund

Near the Bund of Nanjing Road, at about 5:30 PM yesterday, eight unarmed bandits intercepted a passenger on a rickshaw and forcibly robbed him of 150 yuan in legal tender and 1 yuan in Japanese currency.

### University Students Covet Wealth, Kidnap Classmates for Ransom, Handcuffs and Black Glasses Found, Another Perpetrator Arrested Yesterday

Fujian youths Huang Wei (23 years old, residing at 136 Avenue Lafayette) and Yu Bo (22 years old) are both students at Guanghua University. They had a classmate, Chen Wenyuan (26 years old, from Xiamen), whose father was a businessman in Southeast Asia. As remittances had not arrived for a long time, they developed malicious intentions. Learning that Huang Wei's father held an important position in the city's banking industry and possessed a large fortune, they falsely claimed to invite Huang and Yu to watch a movie and invited them to his residence at 26 Wanyi Fang, Luban Road, for a chat. At the same time, they gathered five or six ruffians, who rushed into the room and kidnapped Huang and Yu. They sent a letter to Huang's father demanding a large sum of money. The plan was not secret and was discovered by the French police. They dispatched detectives to arrest Chen and rescue Huang and Yu, confiscating a pair of handcuffs and two pairs of sunglasses. However, accomplices were at large. Yesterday, upon receiving a report from an informant, Xiamen youth Yang Yuxing (25 years old) was also arrested in connection with the case. The police are currently investigating and will prosecute them for kidnapping for ransom once the investigation is complete.

### Embezzling Flour by Taking Advantage of Position, One Year Imprisonment

Punishing One to Warn a Hundred, Eliminating Malpractices

The Shanghai Municipal Council's Information Office announced that "Zhou Shihai, chairman of the Shanghai Big Pancake and Fried Dough Stick Industry Association at 221 Changping Road, was sentenced to one year of imprisonment by the Shanghai First Special District Local Court on the 23rd of this month for the crime of fraud and breach of trust. The reason is that the Municipal Council's controlled food supply aims to ensure that the public can obtain a continuous supply and not be cut off. Therefore, it handled the registration of genuine flour users for allocation purposes. Before the registration was completed, the Bureau had no choice but to distribute a large batch of flour to its members through the association formed by the users. Zhou held the position of Chairman of the Big Pancake and Fried Dough Stick Industry

Association.

He should have forwarded the application forms submitted by the members of the association to the Municipal Council for verification and allocation. Unexpectedly, a large part of the application forms submitted by Zhou were forged. Not only were the addresses filled in fictitious, but the chops affixed were also counterfeit. He sold the batch of flour he embezzled on the black market, making a huge profit. This behavior not only constituted the crime of fraud against the Municipal Council, but also violated the trust placed in him by the members of the association who supplied the public with big pancakes, fried dough sticks, and other staple foods.

All of Zhou's actions were subsequently discovered, and he was arrested by the police. On the 2nd of this month, he was prosecuted in the First Special District Court on the aforementioned two charges. After being detained for questioning twice, and during detention pending trial, more conclusive evidence was discovered. The court then sentenced him to imprisonment according to the law. It is believed that Zhou and others who sabotage the flour control have been sentenced to one year in prison, which not only vents public anger and is deeply gratifying, but also punishes one to warn a hundred, so that those who attempt to sabotage the mechanisms set up by the Municipal Council to cope with the current emergency situation will have a lesson to learn from the past. The Bureau has now carefully studied and improved the procedures for applying for the supply of flour and other items, so that all possible malpractices can be eliminated, and the goal of maintaining the reserve of staple foods and distributing them fairly will not be sabotaged again."

### Two Authorities Continue to Discover Stores Exceeding Price Limits, Strictly Punishing Them According to the Law

The Price Management Committees of the two concessions spare no effort in suppressing the prices of various goods. In recent days, they have dispatched honest and knowledgeable personnel to inspect the city areas and strictly monitor the sales of goods and the level of prices in commercial firms. In the last ten days, several merchants have been found by investigators from the two concessions to have violated price limits and regulations. Most of them sell inferior goods at limited prices. After being discovered, their business licenses are revoked, and they are closed for several days or fined as punishment.

### Rickshaw Driver Sentenced to Seven Years in Lei Yunsheng's Young Master Kidnapping Case

Teng Wenjin, a former driver of the Addo Road French Car Company, was arrested by the French police for his involvement in the kidnapping of the young master of Lei Yunsheng Pharmacy and prosecuted for kidnapping for ransom. He was recently sentenced to seven years of imprisonment.

### Dr. Lee Shuiyenga Hosts Leprosy Patient Shelter, Lifetime Incurable Diseases Separated from the Outside World, Self-Sufficiently Like Another World

In a sparsely populated area on the outskirts of Shanghai, there is a leprosy patient shelter. The shelter is surrounded by a bamboo fence, and it houses hundreds of leprosy patients. The oldest is sixty years old, and the youngest is less than twelve years old. Although life is peaceful, they suffer from a terrible disease, and their pain is something that others cannot understand. It is truly pitiful. Moreover, there are more than just these leprosy patients in Shanghai. There are also some who are self-employed and suffer from this disease. Because they are still in the early stages, they do not pose a threat to society. Their presence can often be seen among the bustling crowds on the streets.

Leprosy Phenomenon

The leprosy patient shelter mentioned in this article is located between two roads near Wujiaochang on Bailinan Road. The severity of the patients' illness varies. Some are blind in both eyes, some have half their bodies numb, some have incomplete arms and legs, and some have lost all ten fingers. All of these are caused by the unfortunate suffering from leprosy. Patients do not want to bring shame on others, so they often deny that the disease is hereditary.

Millions of Patients

Leprosy has been found in China for thousands of years. It is rarely found in Hebei, Shanxi, Henan, and other provinces, but there are many patients in other regions, accounting for as much as 1% of the population. Dr. Lee Shuiyenga, the world-renowned American leprosy authority, estimates that there are over one million leprosy patients in China.

Resigned to Fate

The leprosy patient shelter on Bailinan Road was established by Dr. Lee. The thatched houses provide temporary shelter for sick men, women, old people, and children. These poor wretches have little hope of being cured. Although science is increasingly advancing, unfortunately, it has not yet fully resolved this problem. This disease is a chronic skin disease, causing ulcers and spots, dead wood of fibers, and scaly appearance. Few are fortunate enough to be cured. The patients in the shelter know that there is no hope for them, but they still work hard in this secluded place that outsiders dare not enter, doing housework such as cooking and tailoring. They are completely unaware of the changes in the outside world, resigned to fate and no longer harboring extravagant hopes of going outside.

Withdrawing from the Battlefront

Before the Shanghai war in 1937, these people originally lived in the leprosy hospital near Shanghai. The hospital was large-scale, rare in China, and equipped with new facilities and all kinds of conveniences. Unfortunately, it was destroyed by artillery fire. It would cost a lot to repair it. The patients fled in panic to Shanghai. At that time, Dr. Lee sent food to the patients in the increasingly dangerous area, braving the rain of bullets. The authorities knew that Dr. Lee valued the welfare of the patients in the hospital more than his own life and had sent officers to visit and understand the patients' need for care. Therefore, they uniquely allowed him to pass through the military line.

Panicked Arrival in Shanghai

As the war intensified, it was absolutely necessary to relocate the patients. Dr. Lee also received the final notice from the authorities, stipulating the date for the patients' relocation. If they delayed, the consequences would be unimaginable. The sides of the hospital were already being hit by artillery shells, and the sick women were also in danger. Dr. Lee urgently dispatched two of the most frightening-looking patients to guard the entrance of the hospital, which would deter anyone from approaching. At the same time, he worked hard to find a solution and finally made an urgent appeal to the Municipal Council, asking for permission for the patients to pass through the Public Concession. The Bureau agreed, but on the condition that the patients be isolated from the residents when they were sent into the city.

Dangerous Journey

With the matter settled, Dr. Lee led the patients through the Public Concession. Along the way, soldiers and marines stood guard with rifles and bayonets. The journey was about a mile long. Even those with extremely dangerous illnesses had no cars to ride in, so patients constantly collapsed along the way and had to be carried. At that time, there were still two old people in the hospital who were not leprosy patients and preferred to stay in the hospital and die. However, the patients could not bear to leave them alone and finally took them to a safe place. The patients' destination was the Jessfield District. After arriving in the shared land, they built bamboo fences and thatched huts to temporarily live in, and they still live there today. Dr. Lee, who rescued them, has never left them, striving to improve their welfare.

Religious Beliefs

The patients in the shelter are all devout Christians, with an unusually deep religious belief. Another house was built as a church, with a cross placed on the door. The preacher is a 53-year-old patient, who is also in charge of the finances of the shelter, assisting Dr. Lee in managing the budget, and is highly respected. Men engage in carpentry, shoemaking, and weaving, while women are responsible for sewing and cleaning. Children are taught ordinary school lessons by older patients. Many patients are educated and can speak English.

Self-Sufficient

The wooden utensils, clothing, shoes, etc., made by the patients are thoroughly disinfected before being taken to the city for sale. Purchasers do not need to worry about infection. The proceeds from the sales are used to cover the maintenance costs of the shelter, and the rest is given to the patients for their own use. One patient also runs a pastry and candy business, selling to fellow patients in the shelter. However, due to the current worsening situation, it is no longer possible to continue the business. The preaching pastor in the shelter comes from a church in South China and was ordained just a few years ago. Unfortunately, he contracted this terrible disease. Knowing that he had no hope of recovery, he devoted his life to providing religious assistance to others in the same shelter. The church also has a choir, but due to limited funds, they do not have clean choir costumes. In addition, there are professional artists in the shelter who create colorful portrait paintings for others, working tirelessly.

Others may think that leprosy patients must all be confined to the Bailinan Road shelter, but this is not the case. They can leave the shelter at any time. There are no laws in Shanghai prohibiting leprosy patients from coming and going. However, these people are used to staying in the shelter together and do not leave their close friend, Dr. Lee.

Patients Outside the Shelter

Dr. Lee also runs a leprosy clinic on Carter Road, providing treatment for about 400 leprosy patients outside the shelter. Once or twice a week, he injects Chaulmoogra oil, free of charge for the poor, preventing the spread of leprosy bacteria. This oil is considered the best.

No Need to Worry About Infection

According to Dr. Lee, leprosy is not as easily transmitted as tuberculosis. Breathing in the air exhaled by tuberculosis patients may transmit tuberculosis bacteria, but even with frequent contact with leprosy patients, one can remain unaffected. He has been living with leprosy patients for twenty years and has still not contracted the disease. Shanghai itself does not have many leprosy patients. Most of the patients in the shelter come from the areas surrounding Shanghai, and some are sent in by the municipal authorities, with the costs borne by the authorities.

Morning Light Monthly

The conditions in the shelter are now very different from the past. Dr. Lee is racking his brains to provide the patients with three meals a day. Production work has also been close to a standstill due to a lack of materials. However, the patients do not seek leisure and still publish a monthly magazine, all handwritten. Whenever they see tourists, they show it to them. The booklet is titled "Morning Light," as if symbolizing their pursuit of light.

Huang Huanyu's Painting Exhibition

The famous painter Huang Huanyu returned to China last autumn, and his painting exhibition was unprecedentedly grand, causing a sensation in Shanghai. He originally planned to travel abroad again, but due to inconvenient transportation, he stayed in Shanghai, closed his doors to create, and collected more than 200 of his recent masterpieces. It is scheduled to be publicly displayed for seven days at the Daxin Company Art Gallery from April 27th to May 3rd. It is expected that it will cause a sensation in Shanghai at that time.

### The Study of the Treatment of Epidemic Febrile Disease

Physician Hu Qipeng wrote an article for this newspaper entitled "Epidemic Febrile Disease in Shanghai," which is of great benefit to human health and of particular concern to the medical community. We have repeatedly received inquiries and requests for discussion from various sectors. We are now publishing a letter from Mr. Nie Yuntai. If Dr. Hu's article can lead to more advanced and effective treatments for epidemic fever, the improvement to public welfare would be far from insignificant.

Nie Yuntai Describes Treatment Situation: To Dr. Hu, with great respect. I have recently read your esteemed work "Epidemic Febrile Disease in Shanghai," which lists the statistics of various diseases over five years. I am filled with admiration. I have been researching this issue for several years and previously obtained statistical figures from the Public Concession Health Department for the past two years. I was about to write for the statistical figures for the year before last and last year, but now having read your work, I understand them clearly. However, I would like to inquire whether the term "typhoid fever" includes paratyphoid fever. Is the mortality rate of paratyphoid fever also high? There are four types of paratyphoid fever: A, B, C, and D. The Pasteur Institute in the French Concession differentiates between these four types. I wonder if the health departments in the Public Concession or the French Concession also have separate statistics? If you have any relevant information, please provide it for my reference. Based on scientific pathology, I have used traditional Chinese medicines with antipyretic and anti-inflammatory effects to create a highly effective drug for various types of enteritis, including acute enteritis (including bacillary dysentery, with seven chemical tests confirming its effectiveness). Over the past four years, it has cured many cases of typhoid fever with high fever lasting ten to twenty days, often within a few days. Recently, I cured one case of paratyphoid fever that had been treated unsuccessfully with conventional medicine by Dr. Wang Xingtao, who provided an English letter as proof, and there are also proofs from other physicians. Our methods are completely open, and the medicine is also provided free of charge. I will provide more details later. I have two versions of my highly effective typhoid fever medicine, from the 28th and 30th years of the Republic. I will present you with a newly published version when it is available. Nie Yuntai, April 25.

Qin Chongren Provides Free Clinic: To provide relief to the poor and sick, starting today, the hours of 2 PM to 4 PM daily will be designated for free consultations. Acupuncture for all ailments is completely free. If medicine is needed, this clinic has effective pills and powders available for free distribution. Clinic address: No. 18, Yanjili, north of Old Rubbish Bridge. Telephone: 41190. Sincerely, Physician Qin Chongren.

Yesterday, this newspaper was published at 6:25 PM.

### West Youth Volleyball League Schedule Announced This Week: French Police Play Giants Tonight

The 14th West Youth Volleyball Invitational Tournament will begin tonight at 6:20 PM, featuring two matches in Group B and one women's invitational exhibition match, held at the YMCA gymnasium on Jing'an Temple Road. In the first match, the French Police will face the Giants. The former has considerable strength and has remained undefeated since the start of the tournament. The latter relies on the height of several players, but their skills are ordinary, and they may find it difficult to blunt the French Police's attack. In the second match, Peide will face Monocle. The two teams are evenly matched in terms of strength. Peide has had bad luck with volleyball and has been defeated repeatedly. Monocle has played fewer matches, but their strategies are narrow and lack elegance. The outcome is difficult to predict. Tickets are priced at two yuan. On Wednesday, the 29th, there will be two matches in Group B and the Russian Overseas Chinese team will play the Soviet team in Group A. The schedule for this week is listed below:

Special Feature

### A Record of the Gastroenterology Exhibition at the Aurora Museum

The gastroenterology exhibition is displayed at the Aurora Museum on Route Père Robert near Rue Paul Henry, and was created by Dr. Song Daren to commemorate the fifth anniversary of the founding of the Shanghai Gastroenterology Hospital. It has been open for many days, and the reporter took time to visit it yesterday. The venue was very crowded with viewers, either looking up or looking down, all holding their breath and paying attention to what they wanted to see. The reporter toured for a week and unknowingly spent three or four hours there. The main points are summarized below for the reference of future visitors.

Specimens and Models Are Rare

The exhibited materials all have detailed explanations, including specimens and models: such as pathological specimens of gastrointestinal diseases preserved in solution, which are diseased parts that have been surgically removed and treated with chemical solutions, and then placed in specimen bottles. The Chinese people attach great importance to the remains, and dare not damage even the slightest hair or skin. Therefore, the source of these specimens is very difficult to obtain, and even hospitals abroad cannot fully equip themselves. Even with great financial resources, it is not easy to do so. It is said that the exhibitor has been planning this for a long time, and has also sought them from thousands of miles away. Pathological models of gastrointestinal diseases; pathological tissue specimens of gastrointestinal diseases; were all personally supervised by specially hired technicians together with the staff of the Shanghai Digestive Disease Research Institute. Although there are a few ready-made ones for sale in the market, they may not be accurate. The Shanghai Digestive Disease Research Institute is an academic group specializing in the study of gastrointestinal diseases, located on Fuxu Road in the French Concession.

Chinese Medicine Specimens in Natural Colors

There are more than 100 kinds of Chinese medicine specimens for gastrointestinal diseases, all of which have been proven to have good therapeutic effects. When they were fresh, they were filmed and transmitted in natural color, and the medicinal parts were placed in specimen boxes for easy viewing and are very beautiful. Secondly, there are atlases of digestive diseases: drawings of digestive diseases; and explanations of gastrointestinal diseases, etc.: The atlases of pathology refer to the exquisite books of various countries, or are borrowed from the collections of major hospitals, totaling six or seven hundred pieces. The pathological drawings are based on the experience gained over the past five years, and are truthfully written. Those that cannot be shown in atlases are explained in tables. This kind of material took a long time, and cannot be completed in a hurry. Dr. Song's meticulousness is extraordinary, and he is not sloppy in the slightest. Therefore, the busyness of his clinical work and the happiness of his patients are not accidental.

Novel Instruments and Clear Photography

Diagnosis and treatment techniques: such as gastroscope; color diagrams of gastroscope; slides; illustrated explanations of gastrointestinal disease examination methods, etc.: These are the latest tools for treatment. By viewing these, one can understand the basics of gastrointestinal diseases. Since the stomach is deeply hidden in the abdominal cavity, how can the naked eye see through it? Only novel instruments can solve this difficulty. The gastroscope can not only explore all the conditions of the stomach, whether diseased or not, but also reflect it on the outside and can be photographed. Doctors and patients can review it, and there is no risk of ambiguity. The color diagrams are based on realistic photography, and the colors are set according to the original state, whether diseased or not, and are no different from real organs.

Parasites and Insecticides

Regarding parasites: there are diagrams of the life history of human parasites; preserved specimens of human parasites; tissue sections of human parasites (with electric light device, exquisitely bright and convenient to view); Chinese and foreign insecticides, etc.; parasites have a great impact on human health, and there are many kinds of them. Ordinary people do not know the fear of human parasites, and naturally neglect prevention. Therefore, people with stomach diseases are everywhere. Now, by looking at the life history diagrams, one should also be alert.

Rich Collection of Literature

As for the literature: there is a review of ancient and modern digestive organs, which is based on the evolution of academic knowledge, from rough and rudimentary to detailed and precise. Song's Chinese and English history of digestive diseases in China is very detailed. In addition, there is a Chinese catalog of digestive diseases in the past 30 years; an index of articles on digestive diseases in the world; and an index of books on digestive diseases in the world. This kind of work seems easy but is actually difficult. On the one hand, it cannot be completed in a short period of time. On the other hand, it requires extensive knowledge of international literature, and its contribution to the academic community is huge. Regarding compilation: such as a compilation of famous doctors' case studies from past dynasties; a collection of prescriptions for gastrointestinal diseases from Chinese and foreign doctors in Shanghai; a compilation of Danfang; a compilation of Wan San Gao Dan; and an index of Chinese and foreign drug preparations for digestive diseases; are all of great interest for the reference of specialists. The statistics table of the Shanghai Gastroenterology Hospital is a classified statistic of the results accumulated over the past five years, and is also a rare material.

Hai Xu Lou's Valuable Writings

Writings: divided into series and papers. The gastrointestinal disease series has published "Diet Guide" and "A Treatise on Liver and Stomach Qi Pain," and there are still seven or eight kinds of manuscripts waiting to be printed. Papers have been published in various medical journals, and about a dozen copies have been printed. More than 20 unpublished ones. Song's Hai Xu Lou collection contains about a dozen rare and precious books on gastrointestinal diseases, all of which are displayed in glass cabinets. Reference books: hundreds of specialized magazines in Chinese, French, German, English, Japanese, and American languages. The number is also very considerable. This kind of exhibition is not easy to see in Shanghai, and is very valuable. Especially for those who have gastrointestinal diseases, nine out of ten people have them, because everyone eats and drinks. Most diseases enter through the mouth. With such a good event, how can one miss it?

Exhibits Are All Insured

It is heard that all the exhibits are insured by a major insurance company because of their excessive value, and the premiums paid are also quite a lot. When French Consul General Ma visited, he deeply admired Dr. Song's academic achievements because of his rich and meticulous exhibits. He went to shake hands with him and was very happy. The exhibition will last until May 11, from 1:30 PM to 5:00 PM every day. At the same time, you can visit the upper and lower floors of the museum, various rare and ancient objects and rare animals, and there are real beehive and ant nests in huge glass installations, with a torch reflecting light, so you can directly see their life and work. It is also a spectacle.

Economic Special

### Investment and Speculation Are Confusing: Chinese Stocks Are a Focus for Floating Capital

— Hui

The Shanghai Chinese stock market was vibrant last week. The reason for this is that the soaring price of yarn, the sudden surge in the gold market, and the continued rise in foreign stocks all gave people infinite excitement, coupled with various favorable factors, which promoted the activity of Chinese stocks. At the current stage, the number of Chinese stock chips is limited. Once buyers purchase them, it will form a situation where supply cannot meet demand. Therefore, the forward advance of prices is almost expected.

In summary, the market prices of Chinese stocks in the past week, such as Wing On and Sincere in the department store industry, were flat first and then firm. Since China Knitwear broke through the 20-yuan mark, its bottom has been stable. Moreover, due to the rising price of yarn, it once rose to over 25 yuan, although it immediately fell back, it remained stable at around 24.5 yuan. The volume of financial industry stocks was quiet at first and then increased. The price of the Bank of China fluctuated between 144 and 145 yuan. The Bank of Communications fluctuated between 137.5 and 140 yuan. The Continental Bank was quite active in the previous week, but has been less active since last week. There was not much trading in Zhejiang Industrial Bank, Zhejiang Industrial, Bank of Shanghai, etc. As for the new pharmaceutical stocks, since the dividends and bonuses for the last year have not been issued by each company, rumors of each company issuing dividends this week have become very loud, and the powerful ones have taken the opportunity to purchase them, and the number of circulating chips has suddenly become scarce. It was initially expected that the 35-yuan mark for the new shares of Sun Asia would be difficult to break through, but it was finally realized on Friday, and it once soared to 36.25 yuan. The new shares of China France rose from around 54 yuan to 58 yuan, and there is still the possibility of further increases. The prices of all other stocks also rose from flat to outstanding. As for the industrial stocks, the large investors continued to absorb the new shares of World, and the price rose from 59 yuan to near 70 yuan. The trend of Great China Match was fluctuating. The market prices of textile stocks, such as Wing On Textile, Dat Fong Dyeing & Weaving, and Qing Textile, have all advanced without retreating, probably due to the rise in yarn prices.

In short, the stability and reliability of investing in Chinese stocks has been unanimously recognized by people in society. However, to make the development of industrial and commercial enterprises, it is necessary to circulate their fixed capital chips. Once industrial and commercial enterprises are supported by funds, they will be like fish in water and trees facing the sun. The prospects for development are limitless. The vigorous phenomenon of Chinese stocks last week is really gratifying to us.

### Debt Market Contention

— Sang

Once at the Upper Limit; Stalemate Has Not Ended

The public debt market situation last week, in terms of the overall trend, has reversed the past sluggish situation and turned into a firm and stable state. However, both buyers and sellers have strong forces; therefore, the process of the six days was suddenly rising and falling, changing in many ways, with extreme struggles; as a result, the long side temporarily won, and the closing prices of various stocks on Saturday all rose compared to the closing prices of the previous Saturday. It is estimated that Grade A rose by 4.1 yuan, Grade B rose by 3.8 yuan, Grade C rose by 3.4 yuan, Grade D rose by 4.1 yuan, and Grade E rose by 4 yuan. The past situation is briefly reviewed below:

At the beginning of the week, the scattered short positions on all sides were buying in at low prices, and the new short positions that had been constantly dumped in the previous weeks had stopped selling for the time being; therefore, the situation on the surface turned stable, and various stocks began to rise back by half a yuan to one yuan. However, the next day, another batch of new goods from the same side came out, and the momentum of buying was frustrated; fortunately, the number sold was limited, so the result was that both rises and falls were seen, but the goals of both buyers and sellers were quite different; the former tended to Grade C, while the latter focused on Grades B and E, resulting in the miracle that Grade B was 0.3 yuan lower than Grade C; and Grade E was 5 yuan lower than Grade C. On Wednesday, favorable news was disclosed in various newspapers, and the main banking groups and the North Gang in the financial community also began to absorb it vigorously, and the market situation suddenly became prosperous: Grade A jumped by 4 yuan, which led to the upper limit; there was continued development on Thursday, but the new goods of large investors were waiting for high prices to seek a way out, so the higher the price, the more selling surged; the long side was afraid of not knowing how many real goods were flowing out from the short side, and had to restrain its momentum slightly; therefore, the atmosphere was not as enthusiastic as in the past, but turned into an uncertain situation. By the weekend, the floating long positions had not been able to hold out for long, and began to come out; at this time, the large investors on both the buying and selling sides were collecting their troops and watching quietly, so they let the floating long positions squeeze each other, and the trend was all the way down, and the decline of Grades A and C was particularly strong. The highest prices of various stocks throughout the week were seen on Friday, and the lowest prices, except for Grades D and E, which were seen on Tuesday, were found in Grade A on Monday.

Looking forward to the future trend, in general observation, both the long and short sides seem to be waiting in battle, preparing to launch a decisive battle: but the sellers are unwilling to sell cheaply because the prices are too low, and the long side is unwilling to buy in at high prices; therefore, it is expected that although the competition between the two sides is fierce, there is no situation of one side dominating. Or, if it is encouraged by the news, it depends on which side it is beneficial to, and can rely on to boost its momentum, then it can determine who will win or lose.

### The Sudden Rise and Fall of Yarn and Cloth

— Quan

The yarn and cloth situation last week still fluctuated greatly. At the beginning, under the influence of favorable buying winds, the industry actively purchased, so coarse and fine yarn and cloth continued to advance towards new highs. At the highest point, 20-count Shuangma Factory single yarn saw 5,480 yuan, spot goods saw 6,200 yuan, 20-count Double Globe yarn saw 6,250 yuan, 12-pound Dapeng fine cloth saw 235 yuan, and 16-pound Globe coarse cloth saw 265 yuan, all breaking past records. On Thursday, those who profited took advantage of the high prices to sell, so the market once fell back. Shuangma Factory single yarn once fell to a low of 4,320 yuan. The difference between the rise and fall in a week reached a huge amount of more than 1,000 yuan, and the decline of coarse and fine cloth was also about 20 to 30 yuan, and the amplitude was also quite large. Later, because the factory's production was not abundant and the spot chips continued to be tight, large investors dragged in at low prices, and the price rebounded again. However, the rumors of waiting for the future were frequent, and people's hearts were not as stable as at the beginning of the week, which caused the market atmosphere to be erratic, and it presented a situation of a sudden rise and fall. The yarn and cloth situation, which had been rising all the way, entered a tortuous and winding realm again.

However, compared with the market price of the previous week, the result was still a huge increase. 10-count yarn rose by about 300 to 400 yuan, 20-count yarn rose by about 500 yuan to more than 1,000 yuan, of which the rise of Double Globe yarn was the most fierce, with a sharp increase of more than 1,050 yuan compared to the previous week, and each grade of yarn above 32-count also jumped up by about 1,000 yuan. Because of this, cotton cloth, which is dependent on each other, also rose by about 20 to 30 yuan at the same time.

In summary, the most rapid rise and fall of various yarn and cloth conditions last week should be Shuangma Factory single yarn. After the authorities controlled the transfer of materials, the issue of the movement of cotton goods has become the focus of speculation in the minds of the market. Therefore, at present, there is a huge phenomenon of a difference of 600 to 700 yuan between Shuangma Factory single yarn and spot goods. However, at the end of last week, it was affected by the fact that factory singles could be driven out, which caused a significant reaction, so the difference between the two was slightly squeezed. Secondly, the continued existence of long-term swap fees in the speculative market. At the highest point, the long side had a high price of 50 yuan, which had never been seen before. This situation reflects the increasing number of floating longs in the market. If we analyze it according to the principle of reaction, after the yarn price has risen in a straight line for several days, the footing line has gradually become weak. If there is a slight unexpected stimulus, the possibility of reaction will increase day by day. However, from the perspective of long-term development, the basic footing of yarn and cloth is still very good.

Hygiene

### Terrifying Wall Writings

— Xu Ge

One day, in the houses of the New Hope Hygiene Experiment Zone, a few framed posters were found hanging on the wall. Of course, these framed posters were dull, silent, and speechless, but from the various charts and statistical texts, one couldn't help but be shocked.

"Life and death are predestined, wealth and honor are determined by Heaven." True, that's right. But when the statistics of birth and death are shown to you, you will feel that things are not that simple. From the two tables of birth statistics and death statistics, our China always accounts for the largest number. There are many births and rapid deaths, which almost becomes a "hedge." The highest birth and death rates are in China, followed by India.

Longevity is the first of the five blessings, so let's look at the "Comparison of Average Lifespan of Various Countries" table. China again occupies the top spot, with an average lifespan of 30 years for Chinese men and women. The next are Japan, France, the United States, and Denmark. Denmark is Danish, with an average life expectancy of 61.9 years for women and 60.3 years for men. Almost two Chinese people's lifespans are needed to equal one Dane's.

Having a disease and not knowing how to find a normal doctor, and not knowing hygiene in peacetime, like those who die unjustly, according to the statistics listed in "Annual Super-Capacity Deaths," there are 6 million Chinese people who become "unjustly dead ghosts" every year. The economic consumption per person per year is estimated at a minimum of 50 yuan. (Of course, this refers to the prices before. If we talk about the current situation, we can only buy a斗 of rice.) Then this economic loss in one year will be 30 billion yuan. To narrow the scope, the number of people who die unjustly each year accounts for 15 out of every 1,000 people, and their average age is 10 years old.

In other areas, such as maternal mortality and infectious disease mortality, China is again a "Number One" high school.

The percentage of deaths from infectious diseases in various countries is highest in China, at 42.3%; Australia is the lowest, at 9%. The weather is gradually getting hotter, and infectious diseases are about to rise again. Can we not be chilled when we see these statistical figures?

Why should a person pay attention to hygiene? Why is public health the primary plan for municipal implementation? These simple "wall writings" seem to be able to answer everything.

Climate and Customs

### The Market of Iran

— Yang Huashi

Every spring, between April and May, the nomadic Iranians hold a grand market in the Isfahan area.

From the time of the Persian King Abbas the Great in the 16th century to the present day, the lively atmosphere has not changed much. This market centers on Meidan, a square about 500 meters long, which was once the place where monarchs reviewed troops or received foreign envoys. Nearby is a mosque with a blue roof, and the spacious corridors inside the mosque also serve as temporary market spaces. The pavilions, which are usually closed year-round, are all open at this time.

The weather is clear, and everyone feels happy. Many people are conducting their most important transactions of the year, and the whole place is filled with medieval oriental charm.

The Iranian monarch and nobles come to visit, further increasing public interest. The wealthiest carpet and fabric merchants pile up their goods in the courtyard of a former prince's private residence. Their shops are always set in front of an ancient bronze gate.

There are the most grocery stalls, selling various seeds, cosmetics, spices, fennel, cinnamon, peanuts, date paste, raisins, melon seeds, as well as mirrors, honey, rouge, etc. There are also vendors selling medicinal materials, which are the most needed items for the locals.

Many food shops have doorways decorated with garlands and ovens placed in front, baking various pastries. Passersby all buy some to taste.

In this market, there are at least fifty jewelers. Low glass cabinets display gold earrings and bracelets, amber necklaces, low-quality sapphires, antique-style rings, and pleasing fine gold and silver threads. Iranian women, who love decoration, have to come to the market once a year to buy these things.

Although the pot sellers have a large stock of goods, they are still hammering iron non-stop, and the sound is deafening. Dyers also solicit business here, their hands dyed blue, purple, ochre... Dye vats are placed all around, and foreign tourists cannot help but feel surprised.

In the tunnels of the temple, there are many children selling pottery jars, basins, plates, and the like. The carpet merchants have the most variety of patterns, singing strange tunes to attract customers. Some wear entirely white clothing (white hats, white trousers, long robes) and weave carpets on a small loom. Iranian carpets are world-renowned, and the ones sold here are very cheap.

Arabs hang eye-catching colored signs in the aisles, selling livestock and birds, and their goods are placed in large tents in the open space.

There are also many shoe repairers here, who often oil the shoes of soldiers and police officers for free. They specialize in mending broken shoes, and after repair, those with frayed threads and broken soles look as good as new. There are many customers, so these shoe repairers also have ranks. Those with good skills are patronized by high-ranking people, and their hospitality is particularly attentive. Some hang a birdcage on one side of their stall and place a few fresh flowers on the other, making it easy to identify.

In a corner, there is a very small mosque, which is for merchants participating in the market to pray in. The stone-paved courtyard has a small pool of holy water, which attracts tourists.

People from nearby come to the Isfahan market to purchase goods, and residents from afar come once every few years, so there are yellow-bearded Jews, long-robed Muslims, and soldiers in sky-blue uniforms everywhere. Many locals wear clothes that have not changed in style for over a hundred years, riding donkeys to the market. Some paint their white horses in various colors, and at first glance, people think they are strange wild animals that have never been seen in a zoo.

Many policemen in British-style uniforms also patrol the market to maintain order or protect the officials who come here. The poor people nearby, men, women, old, and disabled, all come to the market to beg, often surrounding shops in groups. After the police drive them away, they gather at the door of another shop before long.

After the spring passes, people leave this place.

### The Power of Self-Confidence

— Translated by Ye Meizhen

If anyone can truly realize the potential within humanity, that person will be able to accomplish great things. But people often deny and despise themselves. They only complain, saying: "I am just a person." Or "I am a woman. What can I do?"

Was Florence Nightingale not a woman? Yet she founded the Red Cross. If this British nurse had only grieved over being a woman, what could the work of healing have accomplished? How miserable would the world be today?

If Madame Curie had only looked down on herself after her husband's death and sighed idly, "I am just a woman!" Then how could the magical work of radium exist today?

That's right! No matter what you are, just stubbornly say: "I can believe. That's enough!" As Nightingale and Madame Curie once said. So they faced their work with full ambition and faith.

When a six-year-old son brought home an expulsion notice from school, was this mother helpless? "My son is not stupid. I will train him myself," she said. So she really did it. Thomas Edison succeeded as a result!

### A Miniature Underwater Tour

— Jian Nong

——A Glimpse of the Aurora Museum

Every time I read scientists' descriptions of underwater explorations, I yearn for it so much that I can't wait to follow them, riding in a diving bell, to witness the ecology of all kinds of strange and colorful flora and fauna in that mysterious sea kingdom! Unexpectedly, this dream seems to have come true for me in a corner of the Aurora Museum. …

There,—in the deepest part of the second floor—there is an almost square table, with glass covers all over it: if you regard that clear glass as clear seawater and inject your gaze into it, you will be able to realize how realistic a miniature ocean that is. … The lowest layer is paved with gravel and fine sand that closely resembles the seabed, with rocky outcroppings and branching coral. These corals come in various colors of red, white, and gray: some have lush branches, like an ancient cypress, and some have gnarled roots, like an old pine; but the most beautiful and moving are those things with thousands of layers and petals, pleated and graceful, resembling two white peony flowers, whose names I do not know.

Speaking of other animals: look at the huge lobster, wearing helmet and armor, lying prone on the beach; look at the small, sword-wielding shrimp, hidden in the reefs. There are also several kinds of crabs with shields: some have particularly long claws, to show their greedy heart of grabbing everything they see, near and far; and there are even various kinds of shells carrying fortresses: some are sharp like pens, some are angular like tiles, and some have tall, bone-like protrusions, to show their forbidding attitude that does not allow offense to the touch. …

However, the most noteworthy and what I have admired and savored for a long time is the supple, upright "Venus's flower basket!" belonging to the sponge family, which is snow-white all over. It is also called the Bridal Basket. --A flower basket? Really, look at how exquisitely and beautifully Venus—Nature—has woven it? Its shape resembles a cylinder, slightly thicker at the top and thinner at the root attached to the rock; about seven or eight inches high, and the diameter at the thickest place is only a little over an inch; the whole body is woven entirely of snow-white and supple fine threads: first, groups of evenly arranged warp threads rise from the root to the top, and then circles of weft threads cross over to divide them into square meshes; there are also fluffy down filling the four corners of these meshes, so that they become hexagonal or circular; in addition, there are strands of fine threads woven in a spiral, and at the top, they form ornaments that resemble lace and tassels. … Heavens! Can the most intelligent painters create such delicate patterns, and can the most exquisite needle-wielding embroiderers weave such petite and exquisite works? …

I stood next to this "Venus's flower basket," admiring and savoring it in a daze: I was amazed and praised the marvel of nature! …

### Machine-Gun Style Loudspeaker

— Yongyun

The latest type of sound amplifier looks like a machine gun. It is said that this style is the most effective, and the audience can hear the broadcast exceptionally clearly, and all mixed sounds can be avoided. However, some people say that this style has a bad psychological effect on the audience, especially in wartime.

### Notes on Malta

— Dafen

Recently, it was reported that the Axis powers are constantly bombing Malta. However, this small island has been painstakingly managed by the British for 143 years, and she seems determined not to easily let it fall into enemy hands. A British political commentator said: "As long as Malta is ours, victory is certain."

But what is so important about this small island, only seventeen miles long and nine miles wide! In fact, its importance lies entirely in its geographical location. It is located in the narrowest part of the Mediterranean Sea between Italy and Africa, and is called the key to the Mediterranean by military strategists. It forms a three-legged position with Gibraltar at the mouth of the Mediterranean and Aden at the southern end of the Red Sea, guaranteeing the safety of the British Empire's shipping route through the Suez Canal to India.

Malta is not only a naval and air force base, but also an important coaling station. Its harbor is excellent and unmatched in the world. The British Mediterranean Fleet headquarters is located here, and all kinds of warships and submarines can be seen in the harbor. The island has an arsenal and a particularly abundant coal reserve.

The population of Malta is about 240,000, with an average of more than 200 people per square mile, so it cannot be self-sufficient. There are about 10,000 farmers on the island, and the output is poor, with only a small amount of wheat, vegetables, and apples. The total value of annual exports is estimated at £250,000, while imports reach £4 million, resulting in a huge trade deficit. In fact, the survival of Malta depends on the British Royal Navy, which spends as much as £1 million annually on repairs and other things, all of which is earned by Malta's dockworkers, mechanical workers, etc. Today, all that is seen on the streets of Malta are sailors, soldiers, air force personnel, engineering service personnel, and passing merchants, which has completely changed the face of the past, when people from all walks of life gathered there.

### In the Same Boat Through Storms

— He Jia Zhi

(4) In the Twilight

Guofang intended to invite Weicheng to go, but Weicheng could not go, but instead kept Guofang there. In just a few days of separation, they already had so much to say, Weicheng was like this, and Guofang was like this too. At first, they talked about big and distant things, such as Mrs. Ye's funeral, etc.; later, they touched on small and nearby things, and Weicheng also asked about the price per foot of the fabric Guofang was wearing. They sat casually in the Shuangmei Study, with Magpie walking around to serve them; Cuizhen knew that Guofang was not leaving, so she decided to prepare a place for Guofang to stay in the inner room of the Shuangmei Study. Weicheng laughed: "Sister Cuizhen, don't be busy, come and talk to Guofang. Although Guofang is studying at a school in Shanghai, and although Shanghai is a prosperous and beautiful place; and girls' schools are seen as aristocratic places; Guofang has not been contaminated with any bad habits. Come and talk to her." Cuizhen held a feather duster in her hand, stood still and laughed: "I don't know what to say, you talk, and it's all about books, I don't understand at all. If I don't speak, Miss Chen will still laugh in her stomach, but if I speak, Miss Chen will laugh on her face." Guofang was originally sitting on a chair, but when she heard Cuizhen say this, she almost jumped up, went over and tugged at Cuizhen's arm, pressed her into the chair and said: "I also call you Sister Cuizhen. You are an unsung hero of the Ye family, and there isn't one in my family. My family only has a grandmother..." Weicheng said: "You are comparing Sister Cuizhen to your grandmother, which Sister Cuizhen dares not accept. I said let's talk casually, we live in the countryside, and it's not as good as Guofang living in Shuangqiao Town. Buying things, eating and using them, is more convenient, to tell you the truth, being here means that the hospitality is inadequate." Guofang laughed: "You don't allow me to be polite, but you are being polite." (60)
