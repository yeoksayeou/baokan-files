### Swedish Prime Minister Reiterates Neutral Policy, Acknowledges Current Situation Is Particularly Difficult, Resolves to Strengthen Defense and Maintain Independence
Stockholm, 2nd (Haitong News Agency) - Swedish Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Hansson reiterated yesterday the country's neutral policy, stating, "Sweden's position is more difficult than in 1939, but Sweden has always maintained its unconditional neutrality. When the war broke out, the guarantees given to us and the world by the belligerent countries regarding unimpeded communication were not fully implemented to the extent we hoped. However, the traffic of so-called 'free movement' ships can still be maintained. We are particularly grateful for this goodwill. We must recognize the possibility of war in our neighboring countries, which will determine our attitude and measures to address the situation. The measures we implement will be understood by everyone. The Swedish people are determined to support the government's policy to strengthen Sweden's defense. Our determination is to maintain freedom and independence. Any attempt to drag us into war will not succeed. We deeply believe that our attitude towards the war is very correct, not only for our own sake but also for the benefit of the Nordic countries. The Danish people share our views, so the time for Nordic peoples to work together is approaching."

### Special Report on the Indian Question
### 11. The Wisdom and Wit of India
The wisdom of Eastern peoples, especially in India, is renowned throughout the world. Ancient Indian texts such as the Vedas and the Laws of Manu contain many aphorisms. Indian intellectuals are said to be less interested in practical knowledge. The term "intellectuals" here refers to those who adhere to Hinduism. Although Indian Muslims know from various examples that they originate from Hinduism, they have learned wisdom from Arabs, Hebrews, Mongols, Christians, and Hindus. The wisdom expressed in Islamic scriptures is not much different in quality from that of Hindus.
Wisdom is often revered in India. "Bodhi" and "Bodhi" mean wisdom. The Bodhi tree once sheltered the wise Shakyamuni Buddha, and millions of worshipers of wisdom consider it the most sacred place.
This idea of wisdom, found in ancient Indian scriptures and Buddhist scriptures, is prevalent among cultured nations in the world today. Here are a few famous quotes: To not harm others with thoughts, words, or deeds is great goodness. One should be tolerant and kind to everyone. Do not let your actions cause physical or mental suffering to others. Those who show compassion to the poor and lowly are good people, like moonlight shining on the humblest thatched hut. One should strive to complete valuable tasks.
Other examples of wisdom can be found in various aphorisms, riddles, parables, short poems, and stories.
There are many Indian aphorisms, and some have spread to other nations. Many Indian aphorisms are similar to those circulated in England. For example, the Indian aphorism "The Mind is Witness To The Mind" is full of truth, like a ripe mango full of juice, but to the average person, it seems vague. Other Indian aphorisms include: "Good deeds never perish." "Good deeds live forever." "Life is finite, but words and deeds are immortal." "The envious are condemned when sober." "Raindrops accumulate to form the sea." "Cows from afar give more milk." "What the superior does, the inferior follows." "An elephant on a mountain is equal to an elephant on the plain." "Do not put prayer beads on the body of a woman who has not given birth."
There are also similar aphorisms in English, the most familiar being "Do not count your chickens before they hatch."
Aphorisms are the result of people expressing their experiences of suffering. Riddles are a product of humor and are as old as the human race. A riddle is a kind of practical training, indicating that human ability can understand the relationship between nature and humanity. A good riddle, while inherently obscure, is also very true in its depiction and accuracy. The most widely circulated ancient riddle is the question posed by the Sphinx: "What animal has four legs in the morning, two legs at noon, and three legs in the evening?" The question posed by the Sphinx is a good example of a complete riddle.
The answer, of course, is "man." Morning, noon, and evening are used as metaphors. Morning refers to when a person is young and cannot walk, crawling on hands and feet, so it is said to have four legs; noon is when a person is in their prime, walking on two legs; evening is when a person is old and needs a cane for support, becoming an animal with three legs.
There are many riddles in Sanskrit Literature. In the hymns of the Vedas, there is a hymn that contains riddles, consisting of fifty-two lines of verse, all but one of which are riddles. The riddles in the Vedas are in the form of high literature and cannot be called "universal."
The difference between ancient and modern riddles is that the latter aims at jokes, while the former is serious, philosophical, and religious. This is especially true of Indian riddles. Ancient riddles, if not religious, must have serious consequences when answered—sometimes involving life and death. Alexander often summoned Indian sages during his Indian campaign to have them guess riddles he had made up.
In Greek mythology, those who could not guess the riddle of the Sphinx were killed by the goddess. Later, Oedipus guessed the riddle, and the murderous goddess immediately committed suicide. In the epic Mahabharata, the protagonist Yudhishthira saved two of his brothers from a monster's captivity by answering a riddle correctly. Sometimes, solving a riddle can lead to marrying a bride. In the hymns of the Vedas, the description of the fire god of the altar is hidden in a riddle.
Wit is a talent similar to humor, but it is more focused and pays attention to the clarity of wording. Humor is a psychological trait that makes people laugh easily, but it is not focused or clearly worded, only expressed through gentle emotions.
So there is a question: Does humor and wit exist in India? The answer, of course, is yes. The best wit and humor in India, like in other countries, is unfortunately not suitable for "high society." The rude quality is subtly hidden inside, and it seems that this is necessary for the flourishing of humor or the expression of wit. India is an emotional and religious country. It is generally believed that humor and wit are incompatible with emotional or spiritual life, so from a European perspective, both Hindus and Muslims lack a sense of humor. This is not true, but it is difficult to prove. At the same time, the characteristics of Indian humor cannot be compared with those of the people of England, France, Germany, Italy, the United States, the Netherlands, Spain, and the Soviet Union. Apart from these few countries, the whole world, especially India, needs the vitamin of humor to nourish itself.
The following are examples of humor and wit cited from various Indian texts.
In ancient times, a king was annoyed by the propagation of empty doctrines by polytheists. The king thought of summoning the preacher to the palace to teach him a lesson. When the preacher arrived at the palace, he still insisted on the doctrine that everything in the world is empty.
The king ordered the guards to lead in a furious elephant and let it charge freely. The elephant lunged at the preacher. The preacher immediately ran away.
"This elephant is just an illusion, why do you have to run?" the king asked, laughing.

### U.S. Continues to Supply Free French Authorities with Manpower and Resources; U.S. Ambassador to France, Leahy, Leaves Europe to Return Home
Washington, 1st (Havas News Agency) - The United Press International issued a message tonight stating, "Responsible parties in the United States indicate that the U.S. will continue to supply the Free French authorities with manpower and resources in the future. However, this action does not mean that the U.S. has recognized the 'de Gaulle' committee as the government of France."
Lisbon, 2nd (Haitong News Agency) - A report from Washington states that authoritative sources in the U.S. say that the U.S. has no intention of formally recognizing the de Gaulle Committee as the legitimate government of France. The U.S. government only recognizes that de Gaulle and his committee de facto have sovereignty over the French territories occupied by de Gaulle's army. It is claimed that U.S. officials believe that de Gaulle only wants his personal power to be confirmed and does not want the power of his committee to continue to exist. This speculation can be confirmed by Admiral Muselier's defection from the committee. Therefore, in this situation, legal recognition of the de Gaulle Committee would be tantamount to recognizing de Gaulle himself as the leader of France after the war. The U.S. government currently has no intention of pre-arranging for future developments. This position has also been clearly notified to de Gaulle's representative in Washington.

### Shanghai Branch of the International Red Cross Receives Crushed Wheat; Distributes to Poor British, American, and Portuguese Nationals
Mr. Aeger, the representative of the International Red Cross stationed in Shanghai, stated that the Shanghai branch of the International Red Cross has received a large quantity of crushed wheat from the American Red Cross stored in various wharves and warehouses in the city. It is intended to distribute it to charitable organizations and British and American expatriate associations in Shanghai. The issuance of this crushed wheat may be implemented in a few weeks. The distribution method is currently being drafted. The association will be extremely cautious to prevent the resale of crushed wheat for profit and will therefore not distribute it piecemeal to the public. Instead, it will be allocated to various charitable organizations for redistribution to impoverished citizens so that those most in need can obtain the crushed wheat. According to the American Red Cross, the crushed wheat flour and oatmeal from the American Red Cross are first distributed free of charge to American expatriates at American schools using a per capita distribution method. However, economically affluent American expatriates should still pay for it, using the funds to support relief work. A portion of the stored wheat is allocated to the British Expatriate Association, which sells it to British expatriates at a price of two yuan per pound, with a monthly purchase limit of five pounds per person. Recently, the Portuguese Expatriate Association also obtained 50,000 pounds of crushed wheat from the American Red Cross for distribution to Portuguese expatriates in Shanghai.

### Shanghai Municipal Council This Year's Budget (3) (Continued)
Municipal General Tax for Western-Style Houses: 21,930,040 yuan
The municipal general tax for the first half of this year is calculated according to the method of the previous year, at 27% of the estimated rent, plus an additional tax of 40%. Empty houses, bureau properties, and tax-exempt properties are excluded from the calculation. From July 1, the tax rate will be increased to 50%. The total amount of rent occupied is higher than the previous year because the rental value of owner-occupied houses and rental houses that have been re-estimated has increased, and the number of new houses completed is also not small. In addition to the usual exclusion of empty houses, some Western-style houses used for industry and commerce in the central and eastern districts have been converted to residential use due to business closures. Therefore, the occupied rental value in the central district is reduced by 5%, and the eastern district is reduced by 7%. In addition, 30% is deducted from the total amount of budget revenue to allow for unexpected circumstances.

Municipal General Tax for Chinese-Style Houses: 14,891,360 yuan
The above explanation regarding the municipal general tax for Western-style houses also applies to Chinese-style houses. However, some of these types of houses used for industrial openings may be unoccupied due to closures, and the estimated rent will be reduced. The amount deducted from the total budget revenue to allow for unexpected circumstances is considered acceptable in the case of Chinese-style houses, so the total amount of revenue listed in the budget is calculated at a reduction of 25%.

Municipal Special Tax: 68,000 yuan for Western-style houses, 480 yuan for Chinese-style houses
The municipal special tax for Western-style houses is 2,668,000 yuan less than the previous year, and the municipal special tax for Chinese-style houses is 251,520 yuan less than the previous year. The municipal special tax currently collected by this Bureau is limited to the area west of the railway line.

The above items should be included after (A) Recurring Income. Here is a supplementary publication of (B) Recurring Expenses.
Before reviewing the expenditures required by various departments of this Bureau and other parts listed in the budget, there are several key points that affect the entire budget that should be noted. For example, the budget does not include payments to personnel on the current long holiday, and the salary increases that should be added upon expiration have been suspended. Except for Japanese and Russian personnel, no other bureau members will be granted long holidays this year. The salaries of staff have been greatly reduced, and the recently approved revision of the salary standards for Japanese staff has been fully implemented.
The material budgets of various departments of this Bureau have been adjusted to greatly reduce the allocated transportation fees, uniform fees, and other necessary expenses, and to bring them closer to the current price level. The expenses required are now at the lowest reasonable limit.
The increase in the cost of goods, public utilities, and other services has caused a sharp increase in many expenditures in this year's budget compared to last year. Although the Bureau has used various reduction and modification methods, it is not enough to

### Salzburg Conference Ends: European War Situation to Have Startling Developments; Germany and Italy Make Major Decisions on Military and Political Affairs, Seemingly a Prelude to Launching a New Offensive

Rome, 1st - Havas: Premier Mussolini yesterday went to Salzburg, Germany, to hold an important meeting with Führer Hitler. He has now returned here and immediately telegraphed Führer Hitler, saying, "I am deeply gratified to have exchanged views with Your Excellency on all military and political issues at this historic juncture. I am particularly pleased that we are in complete agreement on all issues. This is a harbinger of the victory of our allied forces. I would like to express my gratitude to Your Excellency for your kind hospitality and reiterate my sincere friendship."

Rome, 1st - Havas: Mussolini's mouthpiece, Gaia, recently wrote an article in "The Italian Daily," detailing the Salzburg Conference, saying, "The two heads of Germany and Italy have now decided on various steps regarding future actions and have formulated operational plans. We must promote their implementation with all means and the extremely valuable experiences gained from the wars of last autumn and winter. As for what we have decided, we cannot announce it to the enemy. We can only say that this decision is of great significance and the effect is also extremely surprising. The day the enemy is caught off guard is the time when the truth is fully revealed."

Berlin, 1st - Havas: Newspapers commenting on the Salzburg Conference said that from now on, Germany and Italy will jointly launch a spring offensive, and Japan and its allies will also step up their efforts to contain the British and American enemies. All the decisions made at this conference are based on strict reality, material strength, and the absolute initiative of the Axis countries.

Stockholm, 2nd - Reuters: Berlin correspondents for Swedish newspapers believe that Hitler and Mussolini discussed military issues more than political issues in Salzburg, and one consequence of the meeting may be Italy sending more troops to the Eastern Front to fight. In terms of politics, the main point of discussion was France. Italy has recently been demonstrating to France to demand the return of Nice, Corsica, and Tunisia. Germany is using its influence to limit Italy's demands, because Mussolini's anti-French attitude would make it difficult for Germany to deal with at this time. Germany now urgently wants French colonies to maintain the status quo, because Germany understands that the situation in Libya depends on the attitude of French colonies.

Berlin, 1st - Havas: Semi-official sources here recently said that after the important meeting between the two heads of Germany and Italy in Salzburg yesterday, the Axis countries have the great determination to fight to the end, that is, the determination to achieve the final victory, which has been reaffirmed without any doubt. Moreover, the nature of this conference can be seen from the attendance of German Chief of the General Staff General Jodl and Italian Chief of the General Staff General Cavallero. It is customary for the two heads of state to meet every few days, which is completely different from the meeting of ordinary foreign politicians and is by no means comparable. This kind of meeting held in Europe completely reflects the absolute confidence in victory. In general, the Salzburg Conference must have considered the following undeniable facts: In the Mediterranean, the future is very optimistic, because since the last meeting between the two heads of Germany and Italy, the Axis Allied Forces have won the counter-offensive in Libya. At the same time, the British island of Malta in the Mediterranean has been almost razed to the ground, and the enemy's naval strength has also been greatly weakened; the Soviet Union's winter offensive has failed, and Britain and the United States are about to face a major disaster; Japan has made great achievements in the Far East and the Pacific. As for the absurd rumors recently spread about Italy's attitude, saying that France hopes to make a separate peace, the enemy is therefore complacent. In fact, the communique issued by the Bianfang after the Salzburg Conference has cleared up these rumors in one fell swoop and has firmly reaffirmed the sincere friendship between the leaders of the two countries.

Madrid, 1st - Havas: Yesterday, all countries carried Berlin telegrams, saying that there will be startling news to be released soon. The news of the meeting between the two heads of Germany and Italy was indeed released today. ABC reported, "Every meeting between the two heads of Germany and Italy has made important decisions, because the meeting of Axis leaders is at the end of one stage of the war and then enters another stage. For example, after their last meeting, they began to launch the German-Soviet war. This time, they met again in Salzburg, and it is obvious that they have taken very important decisions, but what is their nature, we can only speculate at this time."

### German-Japanese Association Establishes Branch in Munich: Oshima Makes a Statement to the Press; Key Members of Japanese Embassy in Germany Visit Portugal

Berlin, 1st - Havas: The "German-Japanese Association Munich Branch" held its inaugural meeting today. The Japanese Ambassador to Germany, Oshima, specifically made a statement to the press, saying that the relationship between Germany and Japan has become increasingly close due to the existence of this association. "A historic struggle is now underway, which is increasingly favorable to Germany and Japan. The German army, under the leadership of Führer Hitler, is in an increasingly consolidated position. In Japan, it has also occupied the bases of Britain and the United States in East Asia, making its position even more precarious. In short, although Germany and Japan are geographically far apart, they can still cooperate and engage in a common struggle. Both countries know that the current war is very difficult and requires great sacrifices."

Lisbon, 2nd - Reuter: Senior official of the Japanese Embassy in Germany, Admiral Nomura, is now here. The Japanese Minister to Portugal gave a banquet for him last night. Portuguese officials and military attachés of Axis countries in Portugal were invited to attend. It is reported that Admiral Nomura will hold talks with Portuguese Prime Minister Salazar before returning to Germany to discuss the situation in the Far East, especially the Japanese occupation of Portuguese Timor.

### Hitler: Strategizing and Planning, Restless Day and Night

Stockholm, 1st - Havas: The United Daily recently published a dispatch from its Berlin correspondent, saying that Führer Hitler recently said in a speech in the House of Representatives that he had never taken three consecutive days of rest since he took office in 1933. The tension of the current situation can be seen from this statement. The war is becoming increasingly difficult, and not only the leader cannot get a moment's rest, but even the general public cannot be negligent. Several industries in Germany work 12 hours a day, but the government still urges workers to find ways to increase production and sends engineers to factories to provide guidance. In addition, some factories give vitamin pills to workers at the same time when distributing wages in order to increase their physical strength.

### All German Laborers Should Work Hard in Their Own Positions: Robert Ley Appeals; Germany Mobilizes Teenagers to Assist in Farming

Berlin, 2nd - Havas: Labor Front leader Dr. Robert Ley delivered a speech to German workers today, asking rear workers to put in the same effort as front-line soldiers. He said, "Last winter was a dangerous period, which not only determined the fate of an ordinary war, but also concerned the future of the entire Germany and the Germanic nation. The superiority of Germany and its allies has preserved our European continent from the second invasion of the Huns, because the Soviet iron hooves will inevitably lead to widespread death. At this moment, the duty of every worker is to devote themselves to work, so as to alleviate the difficulties of the front-line soldiers. The war cannot be ended by the victory of pounds and gold yuan. Only the bravest and most hardworking nation can achieve true victory. The old world has collapsed, and the new world is yet to be built. It is hoped that farmers and workers across the country will work hard in their own positions."

Berlin, 1st - Havas: German Labor Allocation Commissioner Sauckel issued an order today to mobilize teenagers across the country. Teenagers over the age of ten must assist farmers near their homes and undertake light work, because the authorities believe that mobilizing teenagers to engage in cultivation and other work is currently an urgent task for Germany.

### Rumors of a Coup in Italy: The Rumor That the King Has Abdicated Is Difficult to Confirm

Stockholm, 1st - Havas: It is rumored that a shocking change has occurred in Italy, the King has abdicated, and the affairs of the country are being handled by Premier Mussolini, Foreign Minister Ciano, and General Badoglio. This statement was recently firmly denied by the Berlin correspondent of the newspaper here.

### Japanese Troops in Burma Occupy Mandalay: Japanese Imperial Headquarters Officially Announces; Nyaungyan First Suffers Surprise Attack

Tokyo, 2nd - Domei: Japanese troops in Burma, who advanced north from Rangoon in late March, advanced 500 miles and occupied the important city of Mandalay in central Burma yesterday. The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced the occupation of Mandalay at 4:15 PM today. It is said that the Japanese troops in Burma occupied Mandalay after destroying British-Chongqing troops in various places since late March. The Japanese army has also destroyed the city's military facilities. According to news from the front, the Japanese army entered Mandalay at 6:25 PM yesterday and immediately hoisted the Japanese flag on the highest building. It is rumored that Mandalay is full of flames due to the scorched earth strategy implemented by the retreating Allied forces.

Bangkok, 2nd - Domei: The Japanese naval air force carried out its first night attack on Nyaungyan, an important point on the west coast of Burma, at dawn on the 1st, bombing its airfield, runway, hangar, and barracks area under heavy anti-aircraft fire. All hit, and flames soared everywhere. All Japanese aircraft returned safely to their base.

Bangkok, 2nd - Domei: Thai political figures criticized the Japanese occupation of Mandalay in Burma, saying that the fall of the important city has removed the direct threat to northern Thailand.

Tokyo, 2nd - Domei: Mandalay, the ancient capital of Burma, is an important point on the Yunnan-Burma Road. The Japanese army's capture of the city this time poses a great threat to the British army. Mr. Honma Koji, the Japanese Deputy Consul in Rangoon, worked in that city for two years and is very familiar with the geographical situation of Mandalay. He gave a speech at the South Seas Bureau of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs today, saying that Mandalay is the largest city in Burma. Until 1886, when the British army destroyed the Burmese Wangtai Bao during the British-Burmese War, the city was a capital. The city's palace has been made a scenic spot for people to visit. The city faces the Irrawaddy River and is truly a beautiful scenic spot. The words and deeds of the citizens are not vulgar. At present, the British King's official also resides in the city, ruling several counties, with a population of about 140,000. Many residents of southern Burmese cities such as Rangoon and Moulmein are Indians, but most of the residents of Mandalay are pure Burmese, followed by Chinese, and there are quite a few pro-Japanese people. There are more in Rangoon. I once went to the Mandalay area two years ago. There were about 20 Japanese residents in the area, who were quite oppressed by British officials, and I was also monitored by local Indian detectives. The British army barracks was located near the palace. At that time, it was actively increasing the number of Indian soldiers in the area. The Mandalay area is all plains and receives little rainfall, so it is not suitable for growing rice. The main products are lacquerware, cloth, and marble. Mandalay is 450 miles from Rangoon and about 150 miles from Lashio in the northeast. It is geographically and militarily important. In terms of transportation, in addition to railways, there are also excellent asphalt roads, leading from Rangoon through the city to Lashio. The Japanese army has now captured Rangoon and now Mandalay. If they capture Lashio again in the future, the British army will be completely trapped.

### Prime Minister Tojo Delivers Radio Address: Satisfied with General Election Results

Also, the Japanese troops that landed on the southwest coast of Mindanao occupied Agusan today. It is located 15 kilometers south of Cotabato. In addition, it is reported that the American military authorities originally planned to rebuild the air force in the Philippines, but this attempt has completely failed due to the rapid progress of the Japanese army.

### U.S. Government Limits Wartime Profits: Has Gained Popular Support, Roosevelt's Policy Successful

Washington, 1st - Reuters: The House Ways and Means Committee today passed a regulation stipulating that the tax rate on excessive profits is 94%.

Washington, 2nd - Havas: After the government decided to limit wartime profits, the largest aircraft manufacturer voluntarily transferred $73 million in profits to the authorities without waiting for an official investigation. This step can be regarded as a success of the government's policy of preventing inflation and improving the wartime national economic life. Setting the highest selling price and profit is the first step of this policy, and the second step will be to redistribute manpower and increase wartime industrial employees.

Washington, 2nd - Reuters: Production Administration Chairman Henderson recently spoke to officials after a long conversation with President Roosevelt, saying that the American public has responded well to the government's price limit. When the government first announced the price limit, many people said that they would be destroyed. However, today's newspaper comments generally show that the public accepts the idea that prices should be reduced to the March level. Various trades have begun to make the necessary internal adjustments, showing their full cooperation with the government's procedures.
