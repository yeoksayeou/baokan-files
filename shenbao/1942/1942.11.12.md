Full Text of Hitler's Letter

Berlin, November 11 (Haitong News Agency) – This morning, French radio broadcast the full text of a letter from Führer Hitler to Marshal Pétain, as follows: "Marshal Pétain, after I became the leader of the German people, I attempted to improve German-French relations, and even Germany was willing to give up some rights, but unfortunately, I could not achieve my wish, which is not my fault. On September 3, 1939, Britain and France issued a declaration of war against Germany, which caused me and the German people deep regret, because there was no reason for Britain and France to take such action. After the defeat of France, I still did not give up the ideal of building a strong Europe. Therefore, when Germany proposed an armistice agreement, it did not take advantage of France's weakness and make excessive demands, but only made the minimum demands based on the needs of the victor, that is, a real ceasefire. In any case, if the German army continues to fight against France's allies, the result of the armistice cannot put the German army in a disadvantageous position. At that time, Germany did not make any demands on the French navy, nor did it interfere with the French government's sovereignty in French colonies. However, now Britain and the United States have attacked French West Africa and North Africa and occupied French territories. Germany and Italy cannot stand idly by. In addition to closely monitoring the actions of the British and American troops, the information obtained reveals the imminent invasion of Corsica and southern France by Britain and the United States. This proves that the conditions of the armistice agreement have been destroyed, which is entirely not Germany's fault. The German and Italian governments, in order to prevent this from happening, have to take immediate measures to prevent the British and American attacks. I have dispatched troops to take a shortcut through French territory to occupy the Mediterranean coast, to block the enemy's path of attack, and to defend Corsica, so as to avoid being coveted by Britain and the United States. I would like to declare in advance that the actions taken are not hostile to the French head of state, nor are they hostile to the French government and the peace-loving French people. I guarantee that the Axis forces entering the French Free Zone have no intention of being hostile to the French army. In short, the only purpose of the German military action is to protect the southern coast of France, so as not to repeat the mistakes of French North Africa. For the safety of our people and the entire European people, I must take this preventive measure, because if Europe experiences war twice, all European countries and their cultures will be destroyed. I solemnly assure you that once the situation in the Mediterranean improves and the threat to German interests no longer exists, the German army will withdraw to its original defense zone as stated in the armistice agreement. Furthermore, when Germany and France signed the armistice agreement, I was deeply concerned that if your government was located in Versailles, enemy propaganda would say that the French government no longer freely exercised its powers. Therefore, at that time, I strongly opposed the proposal to return to the capital. Now that Germany and Italy must help France defend itself, they have to send troops to occupy various parts of France to resist possible attacks by Britain and the United States. Then, there is no reason for you and your government to remain in Vichy. In the future, you can freely move throughout France. The previous provisions in the armistice agreement regarding this point should be regarded as revoked. I deeply know the importance of your responsibilities, and I hope you can understand the fate and situation of our people. Therefore, I not only deeply wish that no more bloodshed will occur between Germany and France, but also hope that the relationship between European countries can become closer and closer without being affected by the outside world. Germany is determined to protect the borders of your country and Roman culture. I hope that you can urge your government to take all necessary measures to eliminate all factors that could cause tension and hinder our work. This is also for the benefit of France. I sincerely hope that you will adopt my suggestion. Sincerely, Hitler."

Pétain Protests Solemnly

Vichy, November 11 (Havas News Agency) – Marshal Pétain received General Rundstedt, commander of a German army group, at 10:40 this morning and solemnly protested the German troops' entry into the French Free Zone. His oral statement said, "I have just received a letter from your head of state, saying that he has to take various measures due to military needs, but these measures are actually tantamount to abolishing the basic principles of the armistice agreement. I solemnly protest against this decision, which is inconsistent with the armistice agreement."

### Roosevelt Announces the Course of the Attack on North Africa; the Plan Was Decided at the End of July

Buenos Aires, Argentina, November 11 (Allied News Agency) – When American President Roosevelt was interviewed by foreign reporters yesterday and asked about the background of the North African offensive, President Roosevelt replied that the move was decided at the end of July. About two weeks after the Pearl Harbor disaster, British Prime Minister Churchill came to visit the United States and immediately discussed taking the offensive. The final discussion was about crossing the English Channel and launching a frontal general offensive, but this required sufficient soldiers and ammunition, and the transportation of ships was also a major factor. The more research that was done, the more difficult it seemed. It was decided that this kind of offensive would be difficult to succeed in 1942. The Allied authorities had no choice but to consider the next best thing, and at the end of June, they unanimously advocated taking the offensive in Africa. The concrete plan was finalized at the end of July. As for the whereabouts of Admiral Darlan, the former commander-in-chief of the French army, navy, and air force, he knew nothing.

Bern, Switzerland, November 10 (Havas News Agency) – According to reports from Washington, President Roosevelt told reporters today that "We should not be too optimistic about the North African war, but this battle is only a 'stand-in' for opening a second battlefield. We must regard it as a separate action in the current war, so we cannot be too optimistic."

Churchill Talks About the North African War

Bern, Switzerland, November 11 (Allied News Agency) – British Prime Minister Churchill said at a banquet at Grosvenor House in London last night that the attack on French Morocco and Algeria was planned by British President Roosevelt, and he was only his enthusiastic "aide."

Africa in the Midst of Changing Circumstances

### World-Renowned French North Africa (3)

(1) France may occupy any area when necessary, (2) the local government shall not take any international action without the consent of France, (3) the Governor's dynasty and territory shall be protected by the French army from aggression, and (4) France is authorized to take various financial measures. Thereupon, the French army swept across the entire territory with irresistible force and soon pacified the whole area.

Two years later, a new governor took office and signed another treaty with France, establishing a "protectorate system." The so-called protection is to retain the title of the local governor, allowing it to be inherited from generation to generation, and allowing it to organize a government and issue orders. However, in addition to the governor, France also established the position of Resident-General, representing the French Minister of Foreign Affairs, serving as the chairman of the Tunisian cabinet, guiding foreign affairs, with the power to veto the governor's edicts, and controlling administrative matters. Eight of the eleven ministers in the Governor's cabinet are French.

A glance at the geographical location of Tunisia reveals that it borders the Sahara Desert to the south and Algeria to the north, so there is no need to worry about these two directions. It faces the Mediterranean Sea to the northeast, which is prone to trouble, and its southeastern neighbor, Italian Libya, requires the utmost caution. The country has an area of 125,000 square kilometers and a population of about three million. The capital is Tunis, and important cities include Bizerte and Sousse.

The northern mountains have fertile valleys suitable for growing grains, the southeastern peninsula can grow fruits, the central plateau has pastures, and the south has orchards. Minerals include phosphorus, lead, and zinc. The entire territory was originally an undeveloped virgin land, but after French rule, local order was established, and the economy prospered. The French army, with the assistance of indigenous troops, protects the peaceful Muslims within the territory. Universities and middle schools have been established, railways and highways have been developed, and a postal system has been established. The commercial index was 27 million francs in 1881, increasing to 100 million francs in 1899, and reaching 1.395 billion francs by 1911, demonstrating the speed of its progress. France accounts for 60% of the total trade volume. As for the financial and economic influence of other countries in the territory, it gradually disappeared after 1898.

To encourage immigration to North Africa, France has established an immigration committee dedicated to this task. Although the committee has made great efforts to promote it, only a small number of French people are willing to leave their homes and go to North Africa. French immigrants in Tunisia number only 55,000, but they occupy 2.5 million acres of land, while the total cultivated area is 7 million acres, enough for 200,000 people to cultivate. The strangest thing is that there are half as many Italians as French in Tunisia. Because Tunisia was once a province of ancient Rome, the Italians believe that the country should inherit the legacy. On July 20, 1940, the day of France's defeat, Italian aircraft bombed the port of Bizerte, showing their target. Recently, as the situation in Egypt has become tense, Italian troops have been moving to North Africa, but it is said that they are not going to the Egyptian front line for reinforcements, but rather moving towards Tunisia. Of course, Italy may not want to occupy it, but it is undeniable that Tunisia has been drawn into the vortex of the African situation. If the United Kingdom and the United States were to land in Tunisia in the future, it would not only threaten Libya, but also pose a vital threat to the Italian mainland!

C. Morocco

Morocco, like Mexico, has Spanish blood. The rugged style of the Mexicans seen on the screen fully symbolizes the passion and mystery of Morocco. France's third and final success in North Africa was the conquest of Morocco. The French themselves stated: "It is not out of insatiable greed for land, but rather a necessity."

Morocco is located west of Algeria, south of the Strait of Gibraltar, with the Atlas Mountains traversing the center, blocking the gales of the Sahara Desert. The land is fertile, the products are abundant, and the scenery is beautiful, and the climate is pleasant. It can be said that it is the culmination of all beauty. But only because this piece of meat is too fat, it has become difficult for everyone to swallow, and at the same time, its strategic position is too important, making everyone envious.

Before 1912, it was an independent kingdom, ruled by a Muslim king or sultan. The sultan was called the "Prince of the Faithful," a direct descendant of the son-in-law of the founder of Islam, Muhammad, so he was covered with a "Hifeian" canopy to show his extraordinary glory. However, the scope of his rule was very narrow. The natives in various places had their own chiefs. The first European country to intervene was Spain. In about 1859-60, Spain sent a large army to Morocco, attempting to swallow it in one bite. Upon hearing the news, Britain rushed to stop it, but Spain had already occupied the port of Ceuta facing the Strait of Gibraltar and several other places along the coast. Britain's reason for doing so was that it did not want to have someone sleeping soundly beside its bed in Gibraltar, and that it also wished to continue to enjoy the large volume of trade with Morocco that it had enjoyed since the 12th century. From 1873, Germany sent a representative to the Sultan's court. Although the country's trade volume was small, it also enjoyed most-favored-nation commercial rights. Later, even the United States enjoyed this right.

However, France was not a state of perfect governance, so how could it implement Lao Tzu's doctrine of "within sight of each other's chickens and dogs, the people do not visit each other until old age and death," and allow its western neighbor to live and die on its own? France had to participate in the competition. From 1898 to 1905, Théophile Delcassé, the French Minister of Foreign Affairs, decided to incorporate Morocco into French territory. He realized that this matter could not be accomplished by unilateral action, and that it was necessary to bargain with the European countries involved. Therefore, before launching the action, he conducted a secret diplomatic policy. He first agreed with Italy to allow Italy to seize the Turkish territories of Tripoli and Cyrenaica in exchange for non-interference in France's occupation of Morocco. Next, he agreed with Britain to allow Britain to act freely in Egypt in exchange for Britain's recognition of France's guarantee of Morocco's security and the implementation of assistance in military, political, financial, and economic affairs. Finally, he delineated the spheres of influence in the north and south with Spain. All arrangements were made, waiting for the fish to take the bait. It just so happened that a new sultan took office in 1900. He was young, lustful, and did not care about state affairs. France felt that time was of the essence and presented him with the following conditions: (1) Establish military police under the supervision of French officers to maintain security throughout the territory, (2) Establish a national bank, (3) Use French capital to develop various public utilities.

As the saying goes, even the wise make mistakes. France's plan for Morocco cannot be said to be incomplete, but it simply forgot about its neighbor Germany. In 1905, German Emperor Wilhelm appealed to US President Theodore Roosevelt, requesting that the independence of the Sultan be guaranteed to prevent the commercial routes of the United States in the Near East and the Far East from being blocked. The German Emperor personally landed at the port of Tangier on a yacht and gave a speech, repeatedly stating that he wanted to guarantee the sovereignty of Morocco. France was determined to seize it, and Germany was determined to protect it. Both sides were concerned about saving face and almost went to war. Finally, the cunning Roosevelt came out as a peacemaker, convening representatives from eleven European countries, as well as representatives from the United States and Morocco, to meet in Algeciras, Spain. On the surface, it was to arbitrate everything, but in reality, it was leaning towards France. As a result, a document, the Algeciras Act, was established. On the surface, it seemed that Germany had won, but in reality, it gave France a reassurance. France continued to implement its gradual policy of conquest.

### Commemorating the National Father's Birthday Amidst the Greater East Asia War

— Wang Zhaoming

Every year when we celebrate the National Father's birthday, we are reminded of the difficulties in creating the Republic of China and the unfinished national revolution, which always arouses our infinite admiration and excitement. This year, we are commemorating the National Father's birthday amidst the Greater East Asia War, which is unprecedented. Thinking back to six years after the Treaty of Nanjing was signed, the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom uprising occurred. Two years after the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom was overthrown, the National Father was born. The timing of heaven and human affairs corresponded to each other. Furthermore, recalling that after the defeat in the Sino-French War in the year of Yiyou, the National Father began to harbor the ambition of national revolution. After the defeat in the Sino-Japanese War in the year of Yiwei, the National Father launched the first National Revolutionary Army in Guangzhou. The goal of saving the country and restoring its embrace in East Asia became increasingly clear. We also recall the National Father's speech on Pan-Asianism in Kobe in late November of the thirteenth year, the National Father's declaration on January 1 of the fourteenth year in Beijing to abolish unequal treaties, and the will before his death on March 12. Looking back on the past, if the National Father were still alive today, leading us, cooperating with our friendly nation Japan to complete the Greater East Asia War, and realizing the ideal of Pan-Asianism, we should be overjoyed. Although the National Father has passed away, it is our responsibility to carry on his legacy and strive towards a bright future. We should be of one heart and one mind, working hard and moving forward, just as if the National Father were still alive. Therefore, our commemoration of the National Father's birthday amidst the Greater East Asia War today is filled with more admiration and excitement than in previous years.

The British imperialism is bound to collapse, and the Greater East Asia War is bound to be victorious. There is no doubt about this. Based on the colonial policies exhibited by British imperialism, the most blatant are two: one is the seizure of material resources, and the other is the seizure of human resources. Needless to say, material resources are exploited to the fullest extent. Human resources are only exploited for labor, with no regard for human conscience and personality. This is the characteristic of British colonial policy and the biggest reason for the disintegration of the British Empire today. Since the Greater East Asia War, the friendly nation Japan has advocated East Asia co-prosperity. In terms of materials, economic cooperation is carried out based on the supplementation of strengths and weaknesses and the exchange of needs. In terms of people, the best efforts are made based on morality, mutual assistance, political independence, military alliances, and cultural communication to seek common development. This is the basic spirit of building a new order in East Asia. The efforts of East Asian countries to achieve victory in the Greater East Asia War are also efforts to achieve the realization of East Asia co-prosperity.

We have no detours today, no room for hesitation or wandering. We can only be of one heart and one mind, working hard and moving forward, using the spirit of courage and diligence to seek progress and enrichment in learning, knowledge, ability, and all public morality, and using the spirit of perseverance to overcome the current difficult and painful environment and step onto the bright road. We must strive to be a glorious member of East Asia and strive to be a strong and powerful member. This is the great road that the National Father has pointed out to us. We must strive to do it so that we will not fail to commemorate the National Father's birthday in the Greater East Asia War today.

### Change in Sugar Sales Method: Implementing Rationing by Household; Each Household Can Purchase Seven and a Half Pounds of Sugar Per Month; This Method Still Needs to Be Improved

Since the relaxation of the limit of five yuan for sugar purchases at retail outlets, the situation of small black markets has not disappeared. However, most of the distribution of small black markets has fallen into the hands of buyers, so queuing and squeezing for sugar is worse than in the past, and it has still not become widespread. It is reported that the Cooperative Business Office has decided to change the sales method from today onwards. Each household must purchase sugar with a house tax ticket, and can purchase 25 yuan worth of sugar (five bags at 5 yuan per bag) once a month. Those without a tax ticket are only allowed to purchase one yuan. This may reduce the strange phenomenon of queuing and be more widespread. However, households have different numbers of people, so it seems that it is still not perfect. It is necessary to pay attention to the population aspect, and it will gradually become more perfect.

Five Bags Per Month, Sold for 25 Yuan

The English-language "Times" newspaper reported that, according to reporters, the Shanghai Sugar Merchants Cooperative Business Office announced yesterday morning that, starting this morning (the 12th), each household in the city can obtain five bags of sugar per month, each bag containing one and a half pounds of sugar, with a total price of 25 yuan for five bags. An official from the Sugar Merchants Cooperative stated that this method is only temporary, and a new system will be implemented at the beginning of next month to ensure that residents can obtain a more adequate supply. The official also revealed that various stores have requested the cooperative to directly distribute sugar, and these candy stores are those registered with the Candy Store Association. An official from the cooperative stated that sugar will be distributed based on the Autumn Tax receipts issued by the Public Works Department and the French Municipal Council.

Those Without Tax Tickets Should Apply

As for the general three-tenant households without tax receipts, they can contact the Sugar Merchants Cooperative Business Office at 33 Tongyun Street. After receiving the application, the cooperative will issue a sugar purchase ticket, with which they can purchase sugar at the designated sugar store. Regarding the monthly sugar allowance, the official told a reporter from the "China Press" that everyone should immediately apply to the cooperative and not delay, so as to realize the distribution of sugar as soon as possible.

Prohibit Black Market, Reselling for Profit

It is said that the adoption of this method is the result of careful consideration by the cooperative. The implementation of this plan will enable all residents to obtain an adequate amount of sugar. It is learned that the total amount of sugar received by each household per month is seven and a half pounds. At the same time, the allocation for general large families can also be appropriately increased. According to the cooperative's announcement, after the implementation of the new distribution system, the authorities will prohibit the general practice of purchasing sugar at the limited price and then reselling it at inflated prices in the black market.

Hoping That Residents Will Report Violations at Any Time

He said that this work must be borne by the police, because the Sugar Merchants Cooperative has no power to prevent individuals or other retail stores from selling sugar in the black market at a price of seven to nine yuan per pound. Finally, he pointed out that after the implementation of this plan, sugar will be normally supplied to all residents, but at the same time, residents must fully cooperate and report illegal activities to the police at any time.

### French Authorities Take Strict Action on Rental Housing: Second Landlords Must Not Evade Orders; Investigators to be Sent from Next Month

The English-language "Times" newspaper reported that, even before French Consul-General in Shanghai, Mr. Magre, could dry the ink on his order prohibiting profiteering from rental housing in the French Concession, many second landlords have already found ways to circumvent the order and implement other plans to squeeze third-tenant households. One of these plans is to rent out rooms along with providing breakfast, in order to continue to charge exorbitant rents, as the order does not prohibit charging any amount for breakfast fees. Since the promulgation of the regulation prohibiting the subletting of houses and the charging of profits exceeding 20%, the number of second landlords subletting houses has decreased significantly. Those who defy the law still charge exorbitant rents and require six months' rent in advance. If a house seeker mentions the order regarding the subletting of houses, the second landlord will invariably ignore it. If the house seeker urgently needs to rent a room, they must still comply with the exorbitant rent demanded by the second landlord. Both Chinese and foreign third-tenant households in the French Concession are aware that the authorities have done their best and that it will take two or three months before the new regulations can be smoothly implemented. The rental housing investigation section of the French Police Department is now doing its best to end the chaotic state of rental housing in the French Concession. It is expected that no strict action will be taken against violators this month, as the authorities have allowed second landlords 30 days to adjust the rents they charge and obtain subletting licenses. Starting from December 1, the French Police Department will send investigators to houses where rooms are subletted to check licenses and whether second landlords are complying with the subletting regulations and posting rent income and expenditure statements in a conspicuous place.

### Thieves Collude with Cleaners to Steal Tung Oil

Chinese Detective Feng Qishan and Detective Lu Zhaopeng of the Central Police Department recently discovered that thieves stole 14 barrels of tung oil worth millions of yuan and three sacks of foreign wax at the Shandong Road Suzhou Creek Pier on the morning of October 28. At the time, they colluded with cleaners to use garbage trucks to transport the goods, so they were not discovered by the police. After investigation, the destination of the stolen goods was determined to be Yuan Fengsheng Fur Store at 366 Edward Road. The owner of the store, Sheng Hefang from Wuxi, was arrested and confessed that he had indeed sold a portion of the stolen tung oil to Yuan Da Tung Oil Store at 171 Edward Road. The store clerk, Wu Jingde from Wuxi, was also arrested and detained. The relevant accomplices in the case are currently being investigated, and the original owner of the stolen goods has not yet been identified. Therefore, it is hoped that those who have lost the above-mentioned items will quickly report to the police station to facilitate the investigation.

### Xindu Hotel - Exhibition of Oil Paintings and Antiques

Qian Ding's oil paintings are appreciated by those who know art. His compositions and viewpoints are unique, and his personality is especially well expressed. He is not bound by vulgarity, nor does he strive for superficiality. He is truly a master of the arts. Recently, Mr. Li Xianying, the manager of the Xindu Hotel, arranged for an exhibition of his latest works around the restaurant. The famous hall and the famous paintings complement each other, and all twenty-odd works are meticulously crafted. The blooming cherry blossoms are particularly breathtaking. Other works, such as "Spring Scenery in the Garden," "Autumn Grazing at Houhai," and "Yanshan Palms Together," are all considered masterpieces of the era. Small antiques are also displayed, which are equally charming. One hairpin crystal snuff bottle, with hair standing upright in the jade, is a rare and strange sight.

### Autumn Chrysanthemums in Splendid Colors

— Tao Ran

Once the Double Ninth Festival passes, it is the season for fat crabs and yellow chrysanthemums. Even in present-day Shanghai, we can still enjoy crabs, but where can we go to admire chrysanthemums? Seeing the advertisements in the newspapers these days, I learned that Huang Yuan is holding a chrysanthemum exhibition in two locations, open to the public, which is indeed good news for flower lovers.

I found the location of Xiangxue Garden near the intersection of Carter Road and Jing'an Temple Road. After climbing a few stone steps, I saw a bamboo rack displaying eight or nine small bonsai, which were extremely delicate and exquisite. Then I saw a large pile of chrysanthemums, which were the products of Huang Yuan. I could not distinguish whether they were purple, yellow, white, or green, but I felt a sense of joy and freshness in my heart and eyes. Each chrysanthemum had an elegant name, which was not easy to remember at the moment. The petals were needle-like, whisker-like, tubular, linear, or lotus-petal-like, each different from the others. The colors were even more complex, including white, purple, green, yellow, and red, or gold on the back and red on the inside, or green heart and white whiskers, or yellow heart and purple petals, and other indescribable shapes and colors, making each flower simply adorable. After strolling out of the corridor, I entered the garden. The garden was not very large. Bonsai were displayed in the center, divided into six rows, of different sizes and styles. Each pot was labeled with an elegant name, such as "Longevity Pine," "Return of Cavalry from the Border Fortress," "Secluded Residence Embracing Greenery," "Clear Interest in the Willow Pavilion," "Picture of Banana Leaf Hermitage," "Lofty Scholar in Maple Shade," and "Large and Small Green Reposes," all of which were full of poetic and artistic charm. Among them, "Horse Reining in on a Cliff," "Lonely Sitting in Elm Shade," and "Pine and Crane Longevity" were the most beautiful. Several pots of Chinese wolfberries, bearing bright red fruits, were interspersed among the green leaves. There were also many tree stumps, ancient and venerable, planted in small pots, which were still able to sprout branches and leaves, showing the hard work of the Huang Yuan owners, Zhou Shoujuan and his son, in cultivating them. The surrounding area was decorated with brightly colored potted chrysanthemums, which truly added to the beauty.

After bidding farewell to Xiangxue Garden, I still had time, so I set off on Ga'en Road towards Huang Yuan for more chrysanthemum appreciation. A bamboo fence led into the chrysanthemum garden, which was filled with a riot of colors. First, I saw two large piles of chrysanthemums, arranged on the left and right, with varying heights and order. The green leaves supported a huge flower, with petals hanging down, standing straight out, or twisting and turning, each different. Walking along a small path, I entered the center of the chrysanthemum sea, a beautiful autumn scene that would evoke a sense of love in anyone. Suddenly, in a corner of the chrysanthemum sea, a large group of visitors surrounded an elderly man with white whiskers, who was talking eloquently: "...The appreciation of chrysanthemums is based on the shape of their petals and the color of their flowers, which determine the quality of the variety. The more whisker-like the petals, the better. The more intense and lustrous the color, the best. The leaves must be green and lush, without any 'foot leaves' falling off (that is, the leaves near the soil on the chrysanthemum stem). The height should be about one foot. The flowers should be few rather than many, with three being the most ideal. If these conditions are met, it is considered a good chrysanthemum. Generally speaking this year, the leaves are very green and dense, which is because the drought has inhibited the elongation of the chrysanthemum stem, making the height moderate and the leaf nodes dense. The 'foot leaves' also do not fall off, and the dry weather prevents pests from running rampant. Otherwise, aphid damage is indeed a troublesome thing, but the dry weather makes the work of watering extremely busy..." From these words, I knew that the speaker must be Huang Yuan's owner, Yue Yuanweng, and I could learn how to appreciate chrysanthemums. I followed his instructions and carefully observed the flowers, and I was indeed able to distinguish the quality of the varieties. The best whisker-like varieties were Longran Fengchi, Boyun, Yurun Zhuyuan, Zhusi Qiaotu, Lian Di Cangchun, and Qunyu Shan. The best lotus-petal varieties were Mo Kui, Wushan Jixue, Lao Chan Banzuo, Bilian Tai, and Qiaoluo Jinpan. Other excellent varieties included Long Xiang Feng Wu, Qinghui Mingchu, Ziqi Donglai, Yu Chi Fei, and Hongchen Feixiao. This is my personal assessment. Unfortunately, time did not allow, and in the shadow of the setting sun, I had to reluctantly say goodbye.

### Ma Yuankai Creates New Voting Ballot for Companies

Mr. Ma Yuankai, Chairman of the Board of Directors of China Underwear Company and Anda Textile Factory in Shanghai, noted that in the past, when companies elected directors and supervisors, the voting ballots used generally required each shareholder to fill out one ballot per share. If a shareholder represented multiple households, they would have to fill out each ballot individually, which was not only a waste of paper but also very time-consuming. Therefore, he created a new type of voting ballot. The front side is similar to ordinary ballots, but the reverse side has columns for "Household Name," "Number of Shares," and "Number of Votes." Voters can list the households they represent and fill out only one ballot. This greatly facilitates the counting of votes, the reading of votes, and the calculation of voting power. It is said that sample ballots are available for reference at the Anda Textile Factory on the 5th floor of the Xinxin Company.

### Cigarette Market Weak and Unenthusiastic

### Let Us Think Today!

— Zhu Weilin

Not long ago, I met a veteran Kuomintang party member who had retired due to illness. When talking about Mr. Sun Yat-sen, he said that he had met with Premier Sun several times in the early days of the revolution. According to him, Premier Sun was a very amiable person with a broad mind, full of forgiveness and tolerance, which others could not match. He said that Premier Sun often forgot his personal interests for the sake of the public and forgot personal grievances for the sake of the country's interests. His character was indeed great, worthy of being a natural leader.

Mr. Sun Yat-sen has passed away for many years. Today is the anniversary of Mr. Sun's birth, and we commemorate him because we admire him. Judging from his character during his lifetime, this is not accidental. Today, as we commemorate him, let us each think carefully. If Mr. Sun Yat-sen could come among us today, what would he say to us? Let us also think: Is Mr. Sun Yat-sen's spirit in heaven pleased with our words and deeds today? Does he approve of them? Although Mr. Sun had an extraordinary spirit of generosity and tolerance, would he be able to forgive us for allowing the China he loved so deeply to fall into its current situation?

Let us think today!

### The Drama of Life

— Shen Ji

When those movie stars and stage actors walk past you, you stop to look at them, thinking they are artists. In fact, aren't you also an artist on this social stage? Aren't you performing a more real drama?

The crying of actors on the screen or on the stage often moves you to tears. However, when you see many people standing beside you crying, perhaps begging you more vividly and realistically than the actors' performances, do you sympathize with them?

When you see a "villain" in a play earning ill-gotten gains, stirring up trouble, bullying the weak, or toying with the opposite sex, you gnash your teeth and hate him, right? However, there are such villains everywhere in society. Perhaps they are right around you, or perhaps it is even you yourself. Do you hate them, hate yourself?

You have repeatedly seen many young people in plays fall into depravity, even becoming beggars, due to their fondness for sensual pleasures, gambling, and other vices. However, ask yourself, is your life like this? Don't think that this is just a play, that it is fake. Who can say for sure? If you don't examine yourself, perhaps you tomorrow will be like him today!

Doesn't an act of chivalry excite you and make you want to applaud? Since you admire them and admire their behavior, why don't you become a person with such chivalrous behavior, a martyr?

The lives of actors and actresses on stage are fake. They can portray another life in another play. However, you only have one life. Whether you leave a bad name for thousands of years or a good name for posterity depends on your behavior and your personality. Therefore, friends, on this stage of life, don't miss the opportunity to play a role that is admired! (Remit Payment for Education)

### Porcelain

— Zhang Zhiting

(2) The Manufacture of Porcelain

The process of manufacturing porcelain, according to the old Chinese method, is quite simple. First, the clay from various raw materials is mixed into a suitable composition, and then washed with water to obtain the finest and most tender slurry. The slurry is then poured into a mud filter, and after the water is filtered out, the remaining water is pressed out to form a mud cake, which is the raw material for making porcelain. To make figures of people and animals, the mud cake can be printed with a plaster mold. To make bowls, plates, and other daily necessities, the blank must be placed on a potter's wheel and rotated to form a round blank, and then trimmed with a knife to form a mud blank. After the mud blank is dried or baked, it is sprayed with glaze (or not sprayed), placed in a saggar made of fire clay, and then the saggar is placed in a kiln. The kiln door is sealed, and fuel is burned from the various fire doors outside, allowing the fire to enter the kiln and generate heat. This continues for several hours until it becomes porcelain. After the fire is extinguished and the temperature cools, it is taken out, and the process is complete.

The main tool for firing porcelain is the kiln. German-style kilns are circular with four or two fire doors on all sides. Their advantage is that the firepower is even, but they cannot fire two or three kinds of porcelain with different firing temperatures in the same kiln. Chinese square kilns are like small square houses with four or two fire doors on two sides. Their advantage is that the firing temperature is lowest in the four corners, moderate in the upper and lower parts, and strongest in the center, so they can fire various types of porcelain with different firing temperatures at the same time. A kiln is a small house made of fire bricks, with several fire doors outside the walls and a kiln door for loading saggars. There are fire eyes at the bottom of the kiln, distributed like a star array. Below the fire eyes are flues that lead underground and up to the chimney.

### Sharing the Same Boat in Storms

In these troubled times, such a sound would startle anyone. Second Madam Ye and others rushed like disturbed wasps to Wei Cheng's room. Cui Zhen laughed and said, "Brother Huang Long is just teasing Brother Cheng, nothing else. I know Second Aunt and the aunts will be worried." Second Madam Ye saw Wei Cheng lying on the bed with his eyes closed, his expression as usual, and felt relieved. She asked him if he wanted tea. Wei Cheng opened his eyes and said, "No. My nose feels blocked." Second Madam Ye said, "That's because you've been crying, it's not an illness, nothing to worry about. Okay, don't worry about the ancestral rites, rest for a while." Wei Cheng nodded, asking Xi Que to bring chairs for the First Aunt and Second Aunt to sit. Second Madam Ye said, "We sisters-in-law are going outside, let Cui Zhen and Huang Long keep him company. Huang Long, don't joke with him." Huang Long said, "I wouldn't dare, I wouldn't dare. You all go, now only I understand Brother Wei Cheng's heart. Entrusting Wei Cheng to me is the most appropriate."

By evening, even the female relatives had left, and Cui Zhen felt the pain in her leg wound throbbing faintly. She drank a bowl of thin porridge, and seeing Wei Cheng was alright, she hid in bed to sleep. Wei Cheng said to Huang Long, "The weather seems colder than yesterday. Can you go and check if the portraits of my father and mother have been brought back to the Shuangmei Shuwu (Double Plum Study)?" Huang Long said, "I'll go check." He walked outside and turned back to ask, "You only asked me to check because you said it's cold? They live in glass frames, the cold has nothing to do with them." Wei Cheng sighed on the bed and said, "Whether it has anything to do with it or not, in the opposite case, if my parents were still alive, when it got cold, they would think of whether their child was cold or not." Huang Long quickly agreed, saying "Yes, yes" several times. He went to Shi De Tang (Hall of Worldly Virtue) and Shuangmei Shuwu to take a look, and returned to the room to report to Wei Cheng, "Both old folks are in the Shuangmei Study, they are fine, put your mind at ease." When Wei Cheng saw that it was late, he brought up Cheng Bing's words again, saying, "I've thought it over, without your help, I can't succeed; if I leave this matter entirely to you, you also can't succeed. I think in another week or two, it will be the Lunar New Year. This Lunar New Year, in principle, should be happy and carefree. We should take advantage of this time to go out together." (227)
