### A General Overview of the International Situation in the Past Week

Vichy, 6th, Havas News Agency Dispatch: Political observers here have recently stated that the various political events that have occurred in the past week are preparations for taking military action or diplomatic offensives. Among the most noteworthy are the following: Mexico declares war on the Axis powers; the United States declares war on Romania, Hungary, and Bulgaria; Chief of State Hitler meets with General Mannerheim, Commander-in-Chief of the Finnish Defense Forces; the Eastern Front battles and the North African war are gradually intensifying. Before making a final decision, both sides are closely watching each other, while the British, American, and Soviet countries are conducting negotiations to determine "war aims" as a basis for launching propaganda offensives. As for the attitude of neutral countries, it is also the focus of our attention, especially Turkey. The Turkish government is still strictly neutral and adopts a reserved attitude towards both Britain and Germany. In terms of the relationship between the United States and France, there is still no change. Both sides are still negotiating on the Martinique Island issue, but the relationship between Britain and France is becoming increasingly tense. British aircraft recently bombed the Paris area, arousing a strong military reaction from French officials. In terms of the French relationship, the two countries have very little contact. Only the head of government, Laval, met once with the German ambassador to Paris, Abetz, to discuss economic issues and the possibility of intensifying cooperation between the two countries. In addition, regarding the relationship between France and Italy, Italian Foreign Minister Ciano recently delivered a speech, strongly affirming that the relationship between the two countries is close and that there are no problems urgently needing to be resolved.

Without waiting for police officers to stop them, they went to the docks to watch.

Furthermore, according to a report from the Washington correspondent of the London Times, British Minister of Production Lyttelton, who is currently visiting the United States, has also proposed to the United States that a road to aid Chongqing be opened as soon as possible. It is widely believed that Lyttelton's proposal is related to the lend-lease agreement signed between the United States and Chongqing.

### Dietl Appointed German Commander in Chief, Northern Route Will Launch Offensive, Aiming to Seize Murmansk Port to Cut Off British and American Aid to the Soviet Union

Berlin, 7th, Huitong News Agency Dispatch: German leader Hitler promoted General Dietl to the rank of Colonel General yesterday. He is famous as "The Conqueror of Narvik." At that time, he was cut off from supplies, but still held Narvik, defending against British attacks for several weeks. Therefore, he was promoted to General and awarded the Knight's Cross with Oak Leaves in July 1940, the first German soldier to receive this honor.

Capital of Switzerland, 6th, Havas News Agency Dispatch: It has recently been learned that German leader Hitler has appointed General Dietl as the commander of the Murmansk line in the north. It is generally believed here that Hitler's move is a prelude to a large-scale military attack on the Murmansk Railway. This railway is the lifeline of the Soviet Union, and military equipment from Britain and the United States is transported to the Soviet hinterland via this line to supply the Red Army.

Capital of Sweden, 7th, Havas News Agency Dispatch: It is widely rumored here that the German army will launch a large-scale offensive in the very near future, especially on the central and northern routes. German leader Hitler visited General Mannerheim, Commander-in-Chief of the Finnish Defense Forces. The fighting in the Leningrad area and the Moscow area is gradually intensifying. Therefore, there is a unified saying that

Moscow, 7th, Domei News Agency Dispatch: Lieutenant General Kolomeytsev published an article in the "Red Star" newspaper, stating that the climate in the Soviet Union has improved, and that the German and Soviet armies may launch a large-scale offensive at any time. This type of offensive is mainly aimed at destroying enemy tanks, so it can be called an "anti-tank offensive."

Both Sides Deploying Troops to Prepare for a Major Battle, Combat Situation in Various Areas Becoming Quiet

Capital of Sweden, 6th, Havas News Agency Dispatch

Military observers here recently stated that the German-Soviet War has reached its fiftieth week. Although the combat situation in various front-line areas is one of the quietest weeks since spring, there are currently various signs that the German army will launch a large-scale offensive. However, the operational plans formulated by the German High Command are strictly confidential. As of now, it is still impossible to determine in which area the German army will launch an offensive. As for the southern route, after the end of the fighting in Kharkov, the German army is redeploying to ensure that General Bock's plan to attack the city of Rostov can be realized. This city is the gateway to the Caucasus, and a German attack on this city was originally expected. However, in order to mislead the enemy, the German army may launch an attack in another location. It is also possible that the fighting in the Kalinin area is still fierce, but there has been no news in the past week. It is only known that the Red Army is strengthening its defenses in preparation for a major battle, while the German army is carrying out a sweeping war in the area between Leningrad South and Chudovo. This is probably a prelude to a major German offensive against Leningrad. The German army has been besieging Leningrad for ten months now. Since Lake Ladoga thawed, the transportation line between the Soviet hinterland and Leningrad has been threatened. The Red Army's attempt to launch an offensive in that area similar to the previous one in the Kharkov area is for this reason. However, this German offensive against Leningrad will also be the largest German operation. As for the talk of attacking the Murmansk Railway, it has recently resurfaced. This is because this railway is the lifeline of the Soviet Union. Hitler's appointment of General Dietl as the commander of the Murmansk line proves that this statement is not false. However, the combat situation in that area is unclear. It is only known that in addition to the activities of both sides' reconnaissance teams, the German and Soviet armies are also very active. There is still snow on the ground, so a major battle is unlikely to occur for the time being.

Somewhere on the Ukrainian Border, 6th, Havas Dispatch: Since the end of the fighting in Kharkov, the combat situation in various areas on the Eastern Front has been relatively quiet. Only artillery battles have occurred between the two sides. It is generally believed that this is a prelude to a new German offensive. However, the air forces of both sides are very active. The German Air Force has been constantly bombing the Soviet military's transportation lines, ammunition depots, and airfields on the east bank of the Donets River. According to reports from reconnaissance aircraft, large numbers of Red Army troops are being sent to the front line to prepare for a major battle. Some reconnaissance aircraft have flown into the Soviet rear to conduct reconnaissance, and even flew over the city of Saratov (more than 100 miles southwest of Kuybyshev) once. In the Crimean region, German aircraft have also been constantly bombing Sevastopol, especially last night when the bombing of the fortifications outside the city and the port's military facilities was particularly fierce. Although the Soviet artillery fire is fierce, the Soviet air force still lacks sufficient fighters to counter German air raids.

### Near East Conference Scheduled to Be Held in Damascus in Mid-Month

Istanbul, 7th, Huitong News Agency Dispatch: It has been learned here that a "New Near East Conference" will be held in Damascus in mid-month. Turkish political circles believe that this has two meanings. First, the Near East countries all feel difficulties with the issue of food supplies.

The current president, Baldomir, dissolved the Congress several months ago in order to maintain his power. He has now taken the necessary measures to ensure that his position is not threatened in the election. Baldomir is pro-American and claims that his measures are to maintain public safety and order, but his opposition party does not agree. The pro-president Times newspaper in Montevideo warned the opposition party today that if anyone tries to seize power through a coup, they will be suppressed by the military. Baldomir hopes to be re-elected in this election in order to continue his pro-American policies. It is expected that the president will reorganize his cabinet soon. Uruguay is unlikely to join the war immediately, but if a Uruguayan ship is sunk, Baldomir will likely urge his cabinet to decide to join the war.

Berlin, June 6th, Havas Agency Telegram - Military sources here recently stated that on the North African front of Agedabia, the German-Italian Allied forces recently took advantage of the prior temporary truce to consolidate their positions and reinforce their troops, and have now regained the initiative. On May 26th, the German-Italian Allied forces launched a sudden offensive in the area of ​​Marmarica, catching the enemy off guard.

However, the heat inside the tanks is far higher than this. Although German-Italian aircraft are used extensively in the battlefield, Malta continues to be bombed. The island is now unfit for use by the British fleet, as a result, German-Italian reinforcements and supplies can now be transported from Italy to North Africa without being intercepted by the British fleet, it is said.

### British Deny Mistreating Prisoners of War; Germany and Italy Simultaneously Issue Orders to Cancel Retaliatory Measures

London, June 6th, Havas Agency Telegram - According to an announcement by the War Office, the British government has sent a note to Germany through the Swedish government, denying German allegations that the treatment of Axis prisoners of war on the Libyan front violates international law, it is said.

Berlin, July 7th, Kaito News Agency Telegram - According to the German High Command, the British War Office announced yesterday on the London radio station that the order discovered by the German army was not issued by the British War Office, or perhaps by the commander of the 4th Tank Division. If junior British officers issued this order, the British War Office announced that it would immediately cancel this order and that German prisoners of war would be treated in accordance with the Geneva Convention thereafter. After the British side issued this statement, the Axis forces' headquarters canceled all retaliatory measures stipulated in the order issued on the afternoon of June 6th against British prisoners of war in North Africa.

Rome, June 6th, Havas Agency Telegram - The Italian War Ministry issued a communiqué stating, "Axis troops recently found an order concerning the treatment of Axis prisoners of war on the bodies of British prisoners in North Africa. Its content stipulates that enemy officers and soldiers captured on the battlefield will not be given food or allowed to sleep until they have been interrogated by their superiors. After the German-Italian military commanders learned of this, they were about to consider retaliatory measures when the British radio station suddenly issued a message, strongly denying that the order was issued by the British military authorities. The Italian High Command, after consulting with its German allies, decided to cancel the proposed retaliatory measures," it is said.

Berlin, July 7th, Kaito News Agency Telegram - The statement issued by the British military headquarters in Cairo, stating that the treatment of Axis prisoners of war requires evidence of German attacks, has caused great surprise among political figures here. It is particularly puzzling that the British military headquarters in Cairo and the London War Office have been unable to determine within 24 hours whether the 4th Brigade of the British armored forces actually issued this order. Given modern transportation, the British military headquarters in Cairo could have investigated this matter on the afternoon of the 5th. Either it is true, or why would the British military headquarters in Cairo issue a statement saying that it would take measures to cancel the decree issued by its subordinates? However, the British War Office on the London radio station said that there was no such thing. Therefore, observers here all believe that the commander of the 4th Brigade of the British armored forces may have issued this order, it is said.

Prague, July 7th, Kaito News Agency Telegram - "Národní politika" published an article suggesting that the Protectorate will purge reactionary elements. This article has attracted the attention of Czechs. The newspaper stated that everyone should know that Germany's determination is sufficient to annihilate all reactionary elements in Central Europe within a few days, whether they are reactionary elements of individuals, organizations, or ethnic organizations. If the Czech people adopt a passive attitude, the Czech people will be deprived of the right to be a creative element for Germany. In practice, they will be expelled from the new Europe. Those who opposed Germany in the past have been punished by the German authorities. Subsequently, the Czech government must thoroughly eliminate all elements that threaten the survival of the Czech people, that is, elements that indirectly oppose Germany, and this purge of reactionary elements will first be implemented on teachers and pastors, because teachers and pastors have a great influence on the character of the people. As the Bible says, "Those who sow discord are hated by heaven." Today, we must repeat these words.

### 3. A Brief History of Syria (2)

(4) An Interlude

The story of T.E. Lawrence in the British-instigated Arab revolt should be introduced in particular. Because this is the public evaluation of Europeans: it was not General Allenby, commander of the British Expeditionary Force, who defeated the Turkish Empire, but T.E. Lawrence.

Lawrence can be regarded as one of the most legendary and mysterious figures in the world. He was born in Wales, England, in 1888 and studied at Oxford University. In his spare time, he liked to study archaeology and famous military biographies. Before the outbreak of World War I, he participated in archaeological expeditions to Arabia several times, mastering the Arabic language, customs, and traditions. When the war broke out, he enlisted in the army but was rejected due to his physical condition. But unexpectedly, only four years later, he led a triumphant army into the capital of Syria. The process was as follows: He was first sent to Cairo by the government to do intelligence work because he was proficient in the Arabic situation. In 1917, he joined the staff of General Wingate's Hejaz Expeditionary Force. Because of the successful instigation of Faisal, he became the leader of the Arabs. In 1918, he was transferred to General Allenby's staff, where he traveled and wandered in the Arabian desert. Sometimes he wore the uniform of a British Army Colonel, and sometimes he wore the silk robe of an Arab chief, with gold ribbons inlaid on his shoulders and a gold-handled scimitar hidden in his turban. The Turkish government offered a reward of one thousand pounds for him, but Lawrence was still free to move around. He led the Arabs to attack the railway in Damascus, Syria, and even in the most heavily guarded places by the Turkish army, he had ways to blow up bridges and destroy aqueducts, and sometimes even capture entire Turkish troops. His greatest achievement was uniting the Arabs to resist Turkey together, harassing, eliminating, and attacking Turkish combat troops everywhere.

During the war, Lawrence promised the Arabs that they would gain independence after the war. But the result was not only resentment from the Arabs, but Lawrence was also very heartbroken. King George of England personally wrote to him and gave him the highest military medal, but he refused to accept it. The British government repeatedly invited him to work in the Near East, but he never agreed. When General Allenby resigned from the post of High Commissioner in Egypt, he had a great chance to take the job, but he ignored it. Lawrence refused the British king's decoration, saying: "I cannot break my promise to the Arabs and enrich myself!"

Since then, his whereabouts have become even more mysterious and unpredictable. He died in a car accident on May 19, 1935.

(4) Mandate

Now let us return to the main topic. Syria is located on the east coast of the Mediterranean Sea, bordering Turkey to the north, Iraq to the east, and Palestine and Transjordan to the south. According to the Treaty of Sèvres signed on August 10, 1920, the Allies handed it over to France for trusteeship and obtained the approval of the League of Nations on July 24, 1922. The area within Syria is 60,000 square miles. Initially, it was divided into five parts: Damascus, Aleppo, Latakia, Lebanon, and Jabal al-Druze. In January 1925, Damascus and Aleppo merged to become Syria. Syria enacted a constitution in 1930, and its president was elected by parliament for a term of five years. There are 69 members in parliament, and their candidates are also elected, with a term of four years. Syria is nominally a republic, but its power is actually held by the French. The capital is in Damascus. Outside Syria, such as Lebanon, Latakia, and Jabal al-Druze, each has its own government, and the location of the government is Beirut, Latakia, and Es-Suweida. However, because they are all French mandate territories, and Syria is the largest of them, they are all collectively referred to as Syria.

According to a survey in 1922, the entire population of Syria was 2,831,622, specifically, Syria was 1,696,638; Lebanon was 862,618; Latakia was 286,920; Druze was 51,750. Most of the residents are Arabs, so the Arabic language is also the most common. In addition to Arabs, there are Turks, Kurds, Circassians, Armenians, Persians, Jews, and Europeans. As a result, languages ​​are also very complex in various places. There are also many sects in the country, and most of them are Muslims, reaching 1,514,755 people (1919 survey), accounting for more than half of the total population.

A Glimpse of the Country

Production - Syria is an agricultural country, and agricultural production is quite abundant. According to the statistics in 1931, there are 1,150,000 acres of cultivable land. The main products are barley, maize, olives, silkworm cocoons, cotton, flax, peas, etc. Cotton planting has been quite developed recently, with an area of ​​76,269 acres, and its cotton crop center is Aleppo. In terms of animal husbandry, sheep are the most numerous, but there are very few minerals. Syria is not without mineral deposits, such as the iron ore in Lebanon, which has been mined since ancient times. Other minerals such as lignite, lead, copper-nickel, asphalt, phosphorus, gypsum, etc., are also quite abundant in the country. However, because large-scale mining has never been carried out, the total output is very small.

Trade - Syria's main exports are livestock and their products, vegetables, silk fabrics, agricultural products, etc. The main imports are metal raw materials, chemicals, medicines, and other daily necessities. Exports and imports are often in deficit. Among the importing countries, France ranks first, followed by the United Kingdom, the United States, Italy, and Turkey. Among the exporting countries, France also ranks first, followed by Palestine and Italy.

Finance - The currency unit of Syria is the Syrian pound, and each pound is equivalent to 20 French francs. The revenue in 1929 was 24,126,124 pounds; 28,694,923 pounds in 1930; 19,713,936 pounds in 1931; 17,057,489 pounds in 1932; As for the amount of expenditure, it is roughly the same as its income, but it is always less than the amount of income.

Education - Damascus has a Syrian University, founded on June 15, 1923. Syrian University is divided into medicine, law, literature and art, and other departments, with about 1,000 students. There is also an Arab College, which is specially set up for the education of Arab children. Beqaa has an agricultural college, and Beirut has a technical school, both of which are specialized schools. Beirut also has two universities, one founded by Americans and the other by the French, with good equipment.

Transportation - The transportation in Syria is quite developed. In terms of roads, there are 1,240 kilometers of unpaved roads and 2,750 kilometers of paved roads. As for railway transportation, the western regions are more developed than the eastern regions. There are connections with Turkey, Palestine, and Hejaz. Within the country, there are railways running through Lajaq to Aleppo, Homs to Tripoli, Beirut to Damascus, Beirut to Maameltein, and Damascus to El Hame. The Mukabbir Castle in the moonlight is the largest fortress in Syria. It is said that King Richard I (1157-1199) imprisoned the King of Cyprus here.

The Shanghai Times reported that all Chinese and foreign financial institutions in this city have been paying in reserve notes since last week. The limit for withdrawals by Allied national depositors, which was previously 500 yuan per week, has now been changed to 250 reserve notes.

He Xiaoli, the manager of the Dachang Firewood Company at No. 320 Sichuan Road, discovered that a safe deposit box had been pried open when he went to the company on the 3rd of this month. 16,580 Japanese military scrip and 290 old French francs, totaling tens of thousands of reserve notes, were missing. Upon investigation, a clerk named Zhou Taotao claimed that Luo Yifu, a Shaoxing native who had left the shop, was carrying a package and looked suspicious. Zhou reported this to the General Police Station. Chinese detectives Gao Zhen and Zhang Yunming were assigned to investigate. As a result, Luo Dafu was arrested and admitted to the theft. He confessed that he had deposited all the stolen goods with his friend Tong Yongxiang and his wife Tong Xue at No. 7 Jinjiazhai, Weinan Road, Nanshi. The detectives went to the residence together, arrested the couple, and recovered all the stolen goods. They were taken back to the police station and detained for investigation.

### Different Advantages and Disadvantages of Goods Loans

— You

With the frequent decline in currency value this time, silver shops doing goods loans will suffer significant losses. On the other hand, hoarders of goods who obtain loans will benefit greatly.

For example, if a bank made a goods loan of one million yuan on May 18, it would be equivalent to 770,000 reserve notes at the then market price. Although the intention to recover the loan plus interest today is a total of one million and one thousand yuan, the hoarder only needs to purchase French currency for 500,500 yuan to repay it. Therefore, the lender of loan earned 220,000 reserve notes, or 440,000 French currency, on the receipt and payment of currency. The bank lost 220,000 reserve notes, or 440,000 French currency.

Hoarders not only gain an advantage in the receipt and payment of currency but also earn huge profits from rising prices. During this period, the general price of goods has risen by more than 30%. Therefore, the hoarder had hoarded at least 3 million yuan worth of goods on May 18 (calculated using his own capital of 1 million yuan and loan proceeds of 1 million yuan). With a 30% increase in the price of goods, he earned another 900,000 yuan. Together with the previous currency payment profit, the total is 1.34 million yuan, or 670,000 reserve notes.

However, some banks had taken precautions in advance, either refusing to make loans or requiring payment in reserve notes, settling the price at a 77% discount at the time. If the hoarder accepted the condition of paying at a 77% discount, the bank could earn 270,000 reserve notes, or 540,000 French currency, while the hoarder could still earn 160,000 yuan. Still not bad and each gets their profit. However, if the hoarder did not take out a loan, his profit could be 800,000 yuan, which would be more profitable than taking out a loan.

Goods loans are one of the main reasons for the soaring prices of goods in recent years. With one capital, goods worth three times the capital can be hoarded through five cycles of loans. For example, with a principal of 1 million yuan, the first loan is 700,000 at a 70% discount, the second is 490,000, the third is 340,000, the fourth is 240,000, and the fifth is over 160,000; at this time, the principal and loans combined can hoard goods worth over 2.19 million yuan. Now, at the time of the fifth loan, the price of the goods pledged for the first loan may have risen a lot. Loaners can also apply to the bank for additional loans on the raised portion, and their expansion rate will be even higher. However, if customers and banks do not have special relationships, they generally cannot enjoy this method. Therefore, anyone who can obtain the convenience of goods loans has become a disguised financial capitalist. This newspaper was dispatched at 6:40 pm yesterday.

### The Bereaved Knight – A Eulogy for a Masterpiece of Sculpture

Once again, during a stroll where I was “not working but feeding myself,” I saw a newly displayed Western sculpture in front of an "antique" shop specializing in foreign goods opposite the Electric Power Company on Nanjing Road—a knight. No, it was a female rider. I looked closely at her chest and determined her "gender."

The bronze sculpture, about three feet tall, depicts a spirited horse with a composed and beautiful woman seated astride it. A protruding green stone base firmly forms a cliff-like shape. The rider's expression suggests she is about to leap over the cliff, or perhaps fleeing for her life, her hair pulled back, her posture tense in the wind. I was stunned, captivated. Although penniless, I couldn't help but venture inside to inquire.

I was told it was a piece from Paris in 193* by a famous modern French sculptor, a product of the World Art Exhibition, named C.S.T.R. Colinet. Further inquiries about the author's background yielded no more information.

An American had purchased it at its listed price in Paris and brought it here himself. The American died in Shanghai last autumn. No matter how much the original owner loved this treasure, it is unlikely he would have specifically asked a lawyer to his bedside to write a will saying "to be buried with the corpse" or designate it to be inherited by a particular person. Thus, it fell into the hands of a friend of the deceased. However, the recipient was an absolute novice, unaware of how to appreciate it and finding it somewhat cumbersome. Recently, they resolutely decided to sell it at a listed price, but with one accompanying wish: "May it fall into the hands of someone who understands it and preserve it well!"

Hearing this, the reporter couldn't help but empathize with the friend. Turning back to examine the female statue again, I asked about the price. Moved, I sighed and said, "The Bereaved Knight! I'm afraid you can't be 'returned to Zhao' no matter what!" I staggered out of the antique shop. (Ping)

Economic Special - Issue 417

### Market Commentary of the Week

A week ago, prices had already doubled due to the devaluation of the legal tender (fapi) against other currencies. However, last week, the Western restriction order required all fapi accounts to be halved into savings certificates, causing another surge in prices. Comparing prices at the end of last week with those at the end of the previous week, prices generally increased by another 10-20% to 40-50%.

During the period when the Central Reserve Bank notes (Chu Chung Chao) were equivalent to fapi, such as before the 30% discount implemented on March 20, the cash market price was 12,500 yuan and Shuangma was 1,990 yuan. Now, the price of gold has increased fourfold, and the price of yarn has increased by more than four and a third times. Why would other things be any different?

Halving the currency value and issuing new currency suggests that the total currency in circulation could be halved. According to the quantity theory of money, prices should be halved. However, reality is far from this. Is this theory invalid?

### Market Trends

Government Bonds

There are two views on government bonds. One side (A) says they are a gamble, while the other (B) says the future is optimistic. With each having its own supporters, they are evenly matched. On Monday, trading began using the savings certificates, with prices calculated by halving the closing price from the previous Saturday (public sentiment was cautious for the first two days, and the market was sluggish; Wednesday saw mixed gains and losses; thereafter, Group A gained the upper hand). Throughout the week, all bonds increased by about 5 yuan, equivalent to about 10 yuan in legal tender. Lianhe led Group A, with Tongsheng and Changji also showing strong gains. Tongli led Group B, consistently supplying bonds without hesitation, seemingly confident. By the weekend, Lianhe's appetite had waned, but Hu Heji and others filled the void, strongly bolstering the bullish sentiment, while Tongli continued selling incessantly, appearing confident in their position. Holding savings certificates is not as good as hoarding goods.

Chinese Stocks

This is a manifestation of a morbid psychology. Hoarding goods is not as good as investing in stocks, letting entrepreneurs manage the business; this is a correction of that psychology. Consequently, Chinese stocks have become the darlings of the era. Their upward momentum strengthened last week.

When businesses use savings certificates, they do not calculate prices by halving the original price. Chinese stocks are no exception. Therefore, although trading began using savings certificates at the start of the week, the market price was already above half the original price. Subsequently, prices continued to rise, and by the weekend, they were generally close to the original price. The reason for this is that old investors are reluctant to sell. A one-to-one valuation is on the horizon, making it a good way to preserve assets.

Foreign Stocks

Also opened using savings certificates, and while slightly stronger than a 2:1 conversion, they are not as favorable as Chinese stocks. Despite the difficulty, most prices, when converted to legal tender at the current market rate, have already broken last year's highs. Without this stimulation, perhaps they would not have reached these levels so quickly.

Last week's standout performers were textile stocks. Ewo, China Industries, China Cotton, and Shanghai Wool all rose continuously. Calculated in legal tender, they mostly increased by nearly ten yuan compared to the previous week. Industrial stocks were also strong. Among rubber stocks, England Dakota was the strongest, while Rubber also performed well.

Cash

Initially, savings certificates were used with a halved value, followed by a surge in prices. On Wednesday, the highest price for savings certificates was 21,400 yuan, equivalent to 42,800 yuan in legal tender, breaking all previous records. Although Tianjin dealers tried to sell, it was merely a superficial effort, and the market continued to rise by the end of the week.

Foreign Currencies

British pounds and American gold pounds followed the upward trend. The former reached a savings certificate price of 520 yuan, and the latter 540 yuan. Both exceeded the 1,000 yuan mark in legal tender. The lowest price of the week was 400 yuan, showing that 1,000 yuan in legal tender, previously unattainable, now seems like a breaking point.

The military currency situation is stable. This is a necessary measure to prevent speculation. However, people are still watching how stable it will be after trading is listed on the 20th.

American dollars are relatively firm, while Hong Kong dollars are in a worse position. This is likely related to the Central Reserve Bank's lack of success in southern China.

Yarn and Cloth

After switching to savings certificates, there was a surge in prices. Tuesday was the peak of the week. Factory prices reached as high as 5,730 yuan, equivalent to 11,700 yuan in legal tender, truly unprecedented. Subsequently, those who profited took profits, and the bullish faction also began to short sell. Then, rumors of government control spread in the market. The trend may not be manipulation, but the timing suggests excessive pressure. Regardless of the inside story, this high price base is weak. However, comparing it to the yarn prices in Tianjin, the Tianjin price of 1,520 yuan seems to have momentum.

Judging by the current conditions, the increased cotton production in Central China this year, as reported by the Oriental News, does not seem unfounded.

As for piece goods, Eastern piece goods rise sharply and fall sharply. Factory cloth only increases, rarely retreating, with only slight corrections in between.

Commodities

The general commodity market relied on the adoption of savings certificates to implement price increases, especially for industrial products. In the first few days of the week, all stores were crowded with people scrambling to buy things they did not need. Entrepreneurs also used their working capital to purchase goods. Afterwards, the situation eased slightly because exchanging for savings certificates was not difficult.

Regarding individual categories: Marine products from the North and South increased by about 20% compared to the previous week, but trading was scarce. Metals were difficult to obtain, but trading was very active. Prices, after the guild's conversion to savings certificates, generally increased by about 20-30% compared to the previous period. Pig iron and wire nails were the most traded. Although the tobacco market is in peak season, the price increase was still only about 15%. The candle and soap markets were tight, with prices increasing by 20-30%. Western medicine remained strong, with many seeking out niche products. Stationery was tight and popular, especially metal and mechanical products. Agricultural products also increased slightly, but the increase was relatively small. The prices of controlled goods remained the same. Due to the small military currency pullback, purchasing with legal tender still felt worthwhile.

### Extramural Notes

The interest rate for pawnshops in the city was originally set at 1.5% per month, which civilians already found burdensome. In recent years, it increased to 3%, and since April of this year, an additional storage fee of 1% has been added, totaling 4%. Not long ago, the Pawnshop Association decided to increase the monthly interest rate to 5% starting June 1st, with a total charge of 6% including the storage fee. The term is still set at eight months. If the original value is 1 yuan and the pawn value is 40 cents, then the total principal and interest after six months would be 1.84 yuan. With prices doubling, redemption is meaningless. Thus, pawning without redeeming is what pawnshop owners hope for.

Starting June 1st, the Municipal Council will levy a 2% retail tax on goods: This is similar to stamp duty, which is levied on the transaction amount, not on each item. Although consumers will ultimately bear the cost, it will not be a factor in price determination.

According to a survey by the Industrial and Social Affairs Department of the Municipal Council, 7,400 factories in the Public Concession have reduced their workforce by 57% in the past three months. Coal is expensive and difficult to obtain, and some factories have switched to using wood as fuel. Most of the machinery industry manufactures bicycles, and all factories are operating at full capacity. This should be a special page in Shanghai's industrial history.

According to Japanese reports, the cotton planting area in the six provinces of Central China this year is 18 million mu, an increase of about 15% compared to last year. If the weather is normal, the cotton harvest in half a year is also expected to increase by half.

According to recent reports, the United States has discovered that a by-product of oil refining can be used to make artificial rubber. Some have already used wheat as a raw material for making rubber. When copper is in short supply, silver hairpins are used instead.

### The Problem of Revised Prices

— Shao Wen

After this major financial change comes to an end, the second step should be the issue of businesses revising prices in the new currency, right? According to recent rumors about temporary measures to suppress prices, the regulations stipulate that the average price from May 26th to 28th, halved, should be the highest standard, with strict penalties for violators. However, essential items for everyone's livelihood, such as foreign rice sold by the Municipal Council, which was only 5 yuan in old currency per half-sheng (升半) on the eve of the old currency change, equivalent to 2.5 yuan in new currency, is now sold for 3.8 yuan. As a result, rice shops selling woven rice also increased prices proportionally. The amount of increase in other public utilities (such as public buses and trams in the French Concession increasing prices by more than double from June 1st, and rumors of similar increases in the Public Concession to be implemented on June 5th) is even more alarming. Many property owners are also switching to collecting rent in the new currency. Where does the rumored temporary measure come from? Could it be mere rumor?

### Street Signs

— Lin Bao

It was a stormy night, and darkness enveloped the land. Our car was advancing along a treacherous mountain road. The branches on both sides swayed like ghostly arms. All around us, it was a pitch-black mass. Our car drove with weak lights, turning and twisting on the rugged, narrow road. I don't know how much time passed, it seemed like an eternity, when our car finally arrived at a small, desolate inn.

In the dim oil lamp light of the inn, we all breathed a sigh of relief in unison. The driver quietly recounted the perilous situations encountered along the way. He said that if there had not been those warning and caution signs standing firm on the road, we would have been unable to escape the danger this time. He expressed his deep gratitude to the unknown engineers who braved the heat and cold to erect those road signs on the mountain road. He said that those workers and engineers were truly our saviors.

It was only at this moment that we truly understood the danger of this monotonous and lengthy dark night journey. We also felt that this driver was an extraordinary person. Countless cars pass over the perilous mountain road, yet how many drivers know to express gratitude to those unknown engineers!

On the journey of life, there are storms, dark nights, and also treacherous mountain roads. When we are passing through dangerous situations, let us remember those unknown workers and engineers who erected the road signs. May each of us strive and willingly be an anonymous worker or engineer who erects road signs.

Anecdotes

### Snippets About Tobacco

— Wang Xuan

Someone once said: Smoking is one of life's great pleasures; a cigarette after a meal is as joyful as a deity. Someone else said: Smoking can help promote thought. But others say: Smoking is no different from drug addiction.

In New Guinea, a Catholic bishop, in order to attract natives to the church, would distribute tobacco after each Mass. As expected, every Sunday, the church was packed. Not long after, the tobacco distribution stopped, and no one visited the church anymore. Afterwards, the local chieftain said: "The tobacco is gone, and so are the hymns."

During the American Civil War in 1862, the Union Army would present cigars to the generals of any army that captured a fortress. When General Grant led his troops to capture Fort Donelson, he received 11,000 cigars. However, Grant's smoking was prolific, about 15 cigars a day. In less than two years, he smoked all 11,000 cigars.

Queen Victoria of England hated the smell of smoke the most. Ministers dared not smoke in the reception room when entering the palace. Prince Wales (who later became Edward VII), although he loved smoking Havana cigars, did not dare to be presumptuous in front of his mother. He could only smoke in his private room by the fireplace.

In 1848, the Berlin police strictly forbade the public from smoking in the streets, which led to riots and almost a storming of the palace. The king hurriedly allowed the public to smoke anywhere, and only then did the public's anger subside.

According to Professor Purixi of the University of Berlin, the toxic substances contained in tobacco are not only nicotine, but also ammonia, nitrogen pentoxide, cyanide, and arsenic.

At first, tobacco was only enjoyed by men. In the early 17th century, a woman in London, named Fritz, Mary, pioneered the example of women smoking. Mary often dressed in men's clothing and held a long pipe, swaggering through the streets.

Australia often holds smoking competitions. The record holder is Graves, whose pipe contained one-seventh of an ounce of tobacco and was smoked for two hours and ten minutes without going out or adding tobacco.

Russia forbade people from smoking in the 17th century, and offenders had their noses cut off. During the same period, people in Turkey who violated the smoking ban were punished by having their pipes pierced through the cartilage of their noses, made to ride backwards on donkeys, and paraded through the streets.

British soldiers who returned home after participating in the Crimean War introduced cigarettes to the country. British soldiers learned how to smoke cigarettes from captured Russian soldiers. On the battlefield, they could not find real cigarette paper and had to use ammunition wrappers as a substitute.

In Europe, Austria did not have a tobacco monopoly factory manufacturing cigarettes for sale on the market until 1865. The cigarettes were three times larger than today's cigarettes, with a section left empty at both ends. Only the middle section was filled with tobacco, and they had to be broken in two before smoking.

Cigarette smokers have a habit of throwing cigarette butts on the ground, and the ashes are not extinguished, making it easy to burn tablecloths, carpets, and other things. Many of the carpets in New York's major theaters have been burned by cigarette butts, resulting in significant losses. Insurance companies do not insure damage to carpets, so some large venues have switched to using fireproof carpets made of glass, and some even hire several people specifically to clear cigarette butts from the carpets.

Recently, a woman in Kansas, USA, was caught in a public bus and brought to court by the police for giving her four-year-old son a cigarette. The woman replied, "If the child can't smoke, how can he relax?" In Chicago, a five-year-old boy named Norman Charles lit an expensive cigar on his birthday candles. It was a birthday present from his father. It turned out that this child had been smoking since he was two years old.

### In the Process of Life

— Lei Guang

"Go! Do your work diligently, listen to the boss!" Father said.

Arriving here: my eyes are filled with white rice; unfamiliar faces. But "work diligently, listen to the boss" I remember, and constantly recite it.

Those who come here all have depressed, sallow faces, but there are so many of them. Rice is poured into black and white bags, one sheng, two sheng... The hand holding the money is trembling.

Colorful paper and rice. What passes through my hands every day is just colorful paper and bags of rice.

I don't know which day it was, but a sallow face uttered a strange phrase: "Little sir! Umm, please be generous with your hand! Although I worked hard all day, a child's meal is in the hands of you sir." — Does he have a child? I wonder what they are like! — Thinking like this, the fingers that are scooping rice naturally arched, and the rice rose above the measuring tool. Then the depressed face relaxed, revealing a tragic smile.

"Oh, work diligently, be generous with your hand... and he has a child," I thought when my hand was free, "Ah, ah, so many children! What will they do when they grow up? Probably still work diligently and listen to the boss, right?"

But "work diligently, listen to the boss" I forgot. The boss had said: When scooping rice, your fingers should be straight and the rice in the sheng should be like a bowl or plate, concave, that is the best.

Afterwards, I always encountered that sallow face every day, and the same thing was repeated. I don't know how many days passed, but the boss found out about this, and I was transferred to the warehouse.

The smell of rice husks and the noise of the machine confused my mind. Facing the rice every day, a fiery life force had nowhere to be released, and only dryness and monotony remained. So I remembered those sallow faces, the trembling hands, the colorful paper, and the countless unseen children who were growing up.

Animals

### Man is Inferior to Insects

— Shi Dong

People often hold a contemptuous view of these tiny insects, but they don't know that we are inferior to these insects in many ways.

For example, bees can carry things that are 850 times their own weight. If we were to calculate according to this ratio, we should be able to carry 70 tons of goods. Also, fleas, if enlarged to the size of humans, would be able to jump over obstacles that are 100 feet high.

Although humans have excellent brains, insects still lead in many new inventions. The giant poisonous spider was the first to invent hinged doors and wells. In the mud on the coast, it digs a hole shaped like a small well, with a lid attached to a tough silk hinge that allows it to close automatically.

Spiders also invented the first pontoon bridge, and some ants can even sew. They bite holes in the leaves of trees and then sew them together with threads drawn from orchids, covering their nests.

Speaking of skyscrapers, Americans are far from being enemies of ants. In comparison, the mounds built by termites are actually equivalent to 4,000-foot-high buildings, with countless small rooms inside. The only thing it lacks is an elevator!

But it has a cowshed (where it raises a certain type of plant lice, treating them like dairy cows), a planting farm, a cemetery, air conditioners, and all kinds of "modern equipment".

The current shortage of paper does not affect wasps in the slightest; because they have been making their own paper for tens of millions of years. They select very dry wood and move some of it to the place where they are building their nest. The wood is chewed into pulp, and then mixed with a glue produced in the mouth, and the wasp applies several layers of it to the nest. This mixture is the closest thing to paper.

Regarding building rooms, we still have to consult carpenter bees. It is accustomed to drilling holes in a piece of wood and dividing it into several rooms. In each room, it stores an egg and a small amount of food for the larvae to eat when they hatch. Therefore, when the egg hatches, each room is inhabited by a satisfied little tenant!

A certain type of moth larva is specialized in making diving suits. Using silk thread to sew together the reeds and leaves in the pond, it can make a waterproof garment with a supply of air inside, which it uses to spend months underground. Another caddisfly larva is skilled in applying needles and thread. It can wrap its entire body in silk, and the shape looks like a snail's shell.

It can be seen that although man is known as the head of all spirits, insects must be given the first place in the invention of various things.

### Portable Ultraviolet Light

— Yong Yun

A portable ultraviolet light has recently been invented. It is of great help in crime investigation. It can be used to analyze, investigate, and verify objects with the help of fluorescence. Fingerprints on paper, clothing, and other objects can be found. Alterations to documents can also be found. It can be used to test various minerals, chemicals, oils, medicines, controlled substances, etc.

### Treating Patients' Lives as a Child's Game

— Yu Xin'en

If a patient, out of shame, refrains from telling the doctor the truth, or for fear of trouble, refuses to undergo detailed examinations, then diagnosis and treatment will be difficult, and opportunities will be missed. The human body is extremely complex, especially when many changes occur during abnormal times. If these changes were very common and as beautiful as lightning and thunder, they would be easily resolved. However, many changes are dim and without light; if one does not seek them out, they will naturally be overlooked. Sometimes this oversight is irrelevant to the overall situation, but sometimes it develops into a tragedy. Although such opportunities are slim, one cannot gamble with everything. The loss of money still allows for a chance to rise again, but gambling with life, even once, is enough to cause eternal regret.

Therefore, relying solely on asking for a diagnosis via letter or taking medicine based on newspaper articles is tantamount to considering oneself too simple. If the human body were so simple, medicine would not have been a problem thousands of years ago. But even today, medicine is far from perfect, just as tuberculosis cannot be resolved as easily as removing an appendix in ten days.

When a person is sick, due to the pain, their temperament inevitably becomes abnormal, which is a natural tendency. The workload for recovery and defense will increase many times. However, conflicts between patients and medical staff in hospitals are not uncommon. Among them, there are inevitable excesses. Patients use their illness to coerce, indulge their emotions, and show no restraint, requiring people to wait on them at every moment. Even a slight delay is considered a lack of empathy. However, the work of medical staff is busy and stressful, and sometimes even their diet and daily life are not free. If they were truly machines, even machines have limitations, let alone people?

Naturally, some medical staff also deviate from their position in their work, lacking any sympathy and love for patients. This is extremely inappropriate and unfortunate. Every profession is the same: if one deviates from their position, they lose their value. It is like opening a store to welcome as many customers as possible. However, many stores give you a cold face when you go to shop, causing people to retreat.

Every profession is the same, involving relationships with others and relationships between people. If everyone can cooperate with each other and first recognize their own position in the job, many unfortunate misunderstandings will disappear, and one can create unparalleled value and glory in their profession.

### Sharing the Boat in Wind and Rain

V. Back and Forth

The person who came was the hated Fei Changhe. Fei Changhe's copper basin hat was worn even more askew; the belt around his waist was tied even tighter. As he entered the door, the yellow dog was the first to see him, barking twice from afar. Fei Changhe suddenly squatted down, pretending to pick up a stone from the ground to throw at the yellow dog. The yellow dog was startled and ran away with its tail between its legs. A Xing and Magpie, without prior agreement, exclaimed "Eeh" from their mouths. Fei Changhe had already stood up; his face was not very friendly, and he immediately said, "Your young master?" Magpie said, "The young master is inside." Fei Changhe puffed out his chest, striding through the gate as if counting one, two, three, four. A Xing quietly said, "He forgot the time when Huang could grab him by the neck. Hmph!" Magpie said, "Why don't you go tell the young master? Wait a while, and the young master will scold you." A Xing thought it was right, quickly dropped the brush, and rushed ahead of Fei Changhe. He knew that Wei Cheng was now using the Shuangmei Study as his office, so he rushed into the office to see Wei Cheng intently looking at a drawing of a country on paper, with a pencil in his hand. A Xing quickly walked to his side and said, "That Fei Changhe is here." Wei Cheng turned his face and said, "Who?" A Xing said, "Fei Changhe." Wei Cheng said, "Tell him I'm not home." A Xing said, "Magpie told him he was home, and he's already here." A Xing's words were still being said when Fei Changhe was already standing straight at the door.

Wei Cheng only raised his head to look at Fei Changhe. Fei Changhe didn't even step over the threshold. He only opened his mouth, opening it for the first time without speaking, and only opening it for the second time to say, "I want to call Cui Zhen back." Wei Cheng said, "Come inside. A Xing, let him sit." A Xing waved his hand and said, "Our young master told you to come in." Fei Changhe said, "It doesn't matter if I don't come in; I want Cui Zhen back." Although he said he wouldn't come in, he had already come in. Wei Cheng pointed with the hand holding the pencil and said, "Sit down and talk. I'll tell you, Cui Zhen is at my house; she doesn't want to go back. Today, my aunt is not at home either." Fei Changhe sat down, took out half a cigarette from his pocket, lit it, and said hurriedly, "No! No! Cui Zhen eats well and dresses well at the Ye mansion. If she eats and dresses too well, she won't be used to a hard life in the future. I must have her back today!" (96)
