### Northwest of Stalingrad Tank Battle in Progress: Both Sides' Positions in Disarray, German Air Force Assists in Battle, Flames Reach the Sky

Lisbon, 27th, Allied News Agency: The battle for Stalingrad intensified on the 27th. According to a report from the Associated Press in Moscow, the German army's fierce advance from the central front has rendered the Soviet army incapable of counterattack and has surrounded the city with reinforcements. Furthermore, frontline Soviet sources report that new German troops have launched a major tank battle on the Isuveskahto front northwest of Stalingrad, which is extremely fierce day and night. The sound of artillery has been drowned out by the sound of tanks, it is said.

Lisbon, 27th, Allied News Agency: According to a Reuters dispatch from London, a Vichy broadcast stated that the vanguard of the German army has reached east of Kechia Linsgaya, breaking through the Soviet lines. On the evening of the 26th, they broke into Zipuvga and approached the banks of the Volga River, and are now advancing into the outskirts of Stalingrad.

Berlin, 28th, Allied News Agency: The resistance of the Soviet defenders in the city of Stalingrad on the Volga River is becoming even stronger. However, the German army's three-pronged attack is bringing them closer to the city. The German army has made the greatest progress west of Stalingrad, where the narrow battlefield between the Don River bend and the Volga River is hindering the movement of Soviet troops. The German army's advance has been hampered by the clearing of isolated Soviet troops who are resisting stubbornly behind the front lines. German aircraft are attacking Stalingrad and its rear lines of communication day and night.

Berlin, 27th, Havas Agency: Near Stalingrad, German troops and their allies have launched repeated fierce offensives, and the intensity of the fighting is increasing. The Red Army is now attempting to attack the German salient. The city of Stalingrad is surrounded by important defensive works, making it suitable for prolonged defense. The entire city is like a fortress, with deeply layered defenses extending across a vast area on the west, south, and north sides. In order to break through these strong defenses, the German army must constantly send fresh troops to the front for reinforcement.

London, 28th, Havas Agency: According to reports from Moscow, the German Air Force launched a large-scale bombing of Stalingrad today, with hundreds of aircraft participating. However, the Red Army reserves are still able to pass through the smoke-filled, ruined walls and rubble to reach the front lines and assist the hard-pressed Red Army in combat.

Somewhere on the Soviet Border, 27th, Havas Agency: Today marks the 431st day of the German-Soviet war. The most noteworthy aspect of the Eastern Front is the increasing threat to Stalingrad, as the German army has penetrated deep into the Red Army lines from the northwest and southwest of the city. According to German sources, the Red Army is showing signs of exhaustion, but will likely not cease resistance in the short term. The Red Army's fortifications in the area are very strong, with many bunkers hindering the German army and preventing them from advancing rapidly. The German High Command is constantly moving armored units and infantry to the front lines for combat. The positions of both sides have fallen into disarray, and their exact location is difficult to determine, as the German army is deeply entrenched, and a large number of Red Army troops are still fighting behind German lines. The Red Army is attempting counterattacks at several points. A Soviet armored unit achieved a surprise victory northwest of Stalingrad, catching a German unit off guard and inflicting heavy losses. Later, with the active assistance of the German Air Force, the situation stabilized. Military observers say that in the current great war, air force participation has never been as extensive as on the Stalingrad front. The city was first bombed on August 12th and has since been bombed repeatedly by 1,000 enemy aircraft. Each air raid drops no less than 1,000 tons of bombs. At the same time, a large fire has broken out along the Volga River between Kalach and Stalingrad, and the fire is so large that it can be seen from almost anywhere in Europe. The spreading flames are making the climate even hotter, making the soldiers feel unbearable and making combat even more difficult.

German Forces in Central Sector Shorten Defensive Lines, Soviet Counterattack Gains Progress

Berlin, 27th, Allied News Agency: The German side announced on the night of the 26th that the Soviet army had been concentrating its forces for several weeks to counterattack the Rzhev area, and the offensive has not ceased to this day. The Soviet army's fierce attack on the Rzhev area is an attempt to break through the German defensive lines in the area and resolve the crisis in Stalingrad and the Caucasus. However, the German defensive positions in the Rzhev area are extremely strong, preventing the Soviet counterattack from succeeding.

Struggle for Mountain Passes in the Caucasus: German Forces Encounter Strong Resistance

Berlin, 27th, Havas Agency: Southwest of Garruka and near Rzhev, the Red Army launched repeated offensives. A large-scale defensive battle is currently underway. The enemy's attempt to break through the German lines has failed, and the German army has launched a counterattack to repel them. In short, due to the German army's organized shortening of its defensive lines, the enemy has made some progress in some locations. However, the Red Army's fierce offensive over the past two weeks has still failed to achieve its intended objective.

Somewhere on the Soviet Border, 27th, Havas Agency: Berlin strongly denies the Soviet claims of repeated victories in the Rzhev and Vyazma sectors, and says that the Soviet claim that the Red Army has advanced 35 miles in the past two weeks is completely untrue. The Red Army has continued to launch offensives, but has not achieved any success. However, Soviet sources still say that the Red Army is currently attacking the city of Rzhev and is engaged in fierce fighting with the enemy in the suburbs. The Red Army has also cut off the railway between Rzhev and Vyazma and, after a fierce battle, has crossed the Gzhat River, but was soon stopped by the German army and was unable to continue its advance. This is because heavy rain has fallen in the central sector recently, preventing Soviet tanks from advancing rapidly.

Lisbon, 27th, Allied News Agency: According to a Vichy broadcast, the German army has continued to make progress in the eastern Caucasus and occupied Mostdok, a key railway hub 60 kilometers east of Prokhladnyy, on the 27th.

Somewhere on the Soviet Border, 27th, Havas Agency: In the Caucasus, after German mountain troops successively occupied the major mountain passes, they are preparing to launch a new offensive to conquer the southern regions of the Caucasus. At the same time, in the Black Sea region, German and allied forces have reached 20 miles west of Novorossiysk, but the Red Army is still resisting strongly in the major mountain passes, blowing up mountain rocks and using boulders to block the roads.

Berlin, 27th, Havas Agency: German military sources recently stated that although the terrain of the Caucasus is conducive to enemy defensive warfare, the German army is still able to continue its advance and conduct mountain foothills battles. These foothills pass through the Caucasus isthmus from northwest to southeast, and the terrain is strategically important. We are achieving new successes every day, but the rate of German advance depends on the possibility of providing supplies to the vanguard.

### Hull and Grew Hold Talks: Only Exchange General Information

Lisbon, 28th, Allied News Agency: When US Secretary of State Hull was hosting reporters in Washington today, he was asked if there was anything to announce about his conversation with former US Ambassador to Japan Grew yesterday. Hull replied that he had a routine meeting with Grew, a type of meeting held whenever important ambassadors return to the United States from countries experiencing significant developments. The meeting only involved a general exchange of information. When asked about New Zealand Prime Minister Fraser's meeting with President Roosevelt yesterday, Hull said that this matter should be inquired about at the White House, as he himself was not present at the meeting. When asked if Fraser would visit the State Department for talks in the near future, Hull only said that he would have lunch with Fraser today.

### Bank of China and Bank of Communications to Resume Operations on Schedule: Minister Zhou Issues Statement

Nanjing, 28th, Central News Agency: Regarding the Bank of China and Bank of Communications' decision to resume operations on September 1st, Minister Zhou of the Ministry of Finance issued the following statement: "The preparation for the resumption of operations of the Bank of China and Bank of Communications has been handled by a specially established committee. Plans and regulations have been formulated simultaneously, sparing no effort. Now that preparations have been completed, operations will resume on September 1st. It is deeply gratifying to see that finance in Central China is becoming more developed. The general outline for the resumption of operations of the Bank of China and Bank of Communications clearly stipulates the stabilization of finance and the protection of people's livelihoods. Under the new organization, the banks will reopen and be able to adapt to financial policies, acting as the right and left hands of the Central Reserve Bank. Therefore, its development can be predicted. Although the two banks do not have the special privilege of issuing banknotes, they are still important strongholds of the financial industry. Its important officials are mostly respected bankers in the country. They will surely be able to contribute to the development of national industries, promote production, and revitalize trade. The Central Reserve Bank has already provided capital for the resumption of operations of the two banks and will not hesitate to provide further assistance when the two banks need funds for their operations in the future, so that the foundation of the two banks will be as solid as a rock. The bright future will still be the leader of the financial community in our country. I hope that all sectors will be at ease and start doing business with the two banks to help them develop. The two banks will temporarily start operations in Shanghai, but the preparations for branches or offices in various places should be gradually promoted to complete their mission. As for the resumption of operations of the two banks, I deeply rely on the great assistance of friendly officials and express my gratitude in one sentence."

### Allied Nations to Open New Battlefield: Feasible in the Short Term, Scope Not Limited to European Coastline, British Plans to Reform Military Institutions

London, 27th, Havas Agency: General McNaughton, Commander-in-Chief of Canadian troops in the United Kingdom, stated in a radio address today, "The second battlefield should be opened in the shortest possible time. Allied forces will cross the English Channel in large numbers and achieve victory on the European continent." As for the British landing at Dieppe, the Allied forces are currently collecting valuable information to use as a reference for the next landing. This can be compared to industrial production. The greatest difficulty lies in starting the first machine. "Once it is started, it can be mass-produced without difficulty. We must constantly cross the English Channel and expand the scope of operations, not limited to the continental coastline," he said.

Zurich, 28th, Allied News Agency: According to a report from London, in the past, the British Parliament and the general public have believed that the biggest reason for the British army's repeated defeats is the incompetence of the British army's leadership. Therefore, the calls for personnel changes and institutional reforms are increasing. However, Churchill has consistently refused this. But since his visit to the Soviet Union to inspect the Soviet army's situation and the Middle East, he seems to have the intention of fundamentally changing personnel to break the corruption of the British army's leadership. It is expected that the first thing he will implement is the establishment of an independent command in Iran and Iraq, headed by Lieutenant General Wilson. Churchill is afraid that the establishment of a number of independent commands will be criticized by all parties as a division of the British army's command. Therefore, when changing personnel, he intends to consider establishing a central coordination mechanism for the entire army. According to general observations, in order for the United Kingdom to cooperate with the Soviet army strategically, it is difficult to find a suitable general for the person in charge of the central agency other than General Wavell, Commander-in-Chief of the Indian Army. Therefore, it is believed that Wavell's appointment as the person in charge of the central agency is inevitable. As for the successor to the Commander-in-Chief of the Indian Army, it is expected that it will be General Auchinleck, the recently dismissed Middle East commander.

Bern, Switzerland, 27th, Havas Agency: A correspondent for the National Journal in London recently reported that all sectors of British society are currently feeling unusually uneasy. The call for opening a second battlefield is no longer being promoted by the press and the labor movement. The precarious situation in Stalingrad on the Eastern Front is well known here. However, people in and out of the government believe that the issue of a second battlefield has been resolved during the talks between Prime Minister Churchill and Moscow. From the fact that the Prime Minister is unwilling to make a public statement to Parliament, it can be inferred that action will be taken soon. At the same time, the war in the Near East is likely to develop. At that time, not only will Egypt be affected, but other countries will also be affected. The future of Britain and its allies is difficult, and the people of London are fully aware of this. Although the German Commander in North Africa, General Rommel, lost more military equipment in the recent battles than in the battles on the borders of Libya and Egypt, he has received a large number of reinforcements. As for the Soviet Union, the general public believes that the country has decided to continue fighting to the end. Even if the lower reaches of the Volga River are lost in the future, the Soviet resistance camp will not collapse immediately. What is worrying is that the German army may stop its offensive and reorganize its occupied areas in order to achieve self-sufficiency and continue its westward advance in the future. In addition, an editorial in the London Times today stated that the landing at Dieppe and the air force bombing of Germany have not eliminated the impression that Britain's war effort is not sufficient. It is noteworthy that there are rumors circulating in London that there will be a major reshuffle of senior generals in the country.

### Churchill Meets with the King, Reports on Visit to Soviet Union, Wavell Returns to India

British Appoint Mr. Moun as Deputy Representative to the Middle East

London, 27th - Havas News Agency: The British government has appointed Lord Moun as an assistant to the High Commissioner in the Middle East, to assist Casey in handling Middle Eastern affairs. According to regulations, he is a member of the wartime cabinet.

Stockholm, 28th - Haitong News Agency: Britain's establishment of a Deputy Representative to the Near East is a result of Churchill's visit to Egypt, and is exactly the same as the replacement of the Commander-in-Chief of British forces in North Africa. British government officials indicate that the wartime cabinet can dispatch Casey or Moun to areas outside of Egypt at any time. Political figures believe that one of Casey or Moun will be responsible for liaising between the British and Soviet governments in the Caucasus region, Iran, or Iraq.

### Roosevelt Convenes Pacific Military Conference, Representatives from All Concerned Countries Attend, Bullitt Returns from Europe to Report

### Air Raid Alarm to be Tested in Both Concessions This Afternoon, Test Duration is Ten Minutes, Testing Whether Each Area Can Hear It

The Public Information Office of the Public Works Department announced: The air raid siren installed on the roof of the Wing On Company on Nanjing Road is scheduled to be tested at noon today (29th) for a duration of ten minutes. Also, the sirens installed at the Jing'an Temple Fire Station and the patrolmen's dormitories on Chengdu Road will be tested for ten minutes at the same time, in order to test whether residents in each area can hear the sirens. Citizens should not be alarmed. The French authorities have issued the following notice for air defense matters: Today, Shanghai will use bell sounds as a test for air raid alarms. This test will be held in the French Concession immediately following the Public Concession. This test will begin at 12:10 and end at 12:20. At that time, the sirens of the Leiche Company, the bell of the Xiafei Road Fire Department, and the bells of various churches will all sound at the same time as a test of the air raid alarm.

Lights Out Regulations Must Not Be Ignored

The French authorities are deeply grateful to the people in the concession for complying with the various light control measures implemented on the 25th. This exercise was the first test, with the aim of achieving the greatest effect in an emergency. Now, the highest-ranking officers of the Japanese Army and Navy have stated that the results of the exercise that night were very good. This is especially due to the enthusiasm of the Baojia personnel, which is highly commendable. In subsequent exercises, administrative agencies, hospitals, schools, factories, stores, various groups, and private individuals should maintain the minimum and sufficient lighting for their buildings in order to continue normal work. Everyone should take measures to ensure that light does not leak out. The inspection and testing of light control in various areas will be directed by the Air Defense Committee and implemented by the Police Department and Baojia. Only with the cooperation of the public and the authorities can good results be achieved. Because light control is a matter of collective safety, it cannot be jeopardized by the malice or negligence of a few people. In other words, the authorities will absolutely not allow a few people to undermine the efforts of the majority of residents. Everyone needs to be aware of this point.

Shield the Lights, Don't Let Them Leak Out

The Shanghai Times stated that the authorities in this city still need to improve two points regarding light control, so that the next air defense exercise can be completely successful. Therefore, yesterday (27th), they continued to issue instructions to the self-defense corps to correct the actions of the members during the air defense exercise and to improve the control of lights in residences and offices, so that they can maintain normal activities during light control periods. It is said that during the light control period on Tuesday of this week, the self-defense corps members on duty repeatedly instructed residents in the area to completely extinguish their lights, which was inappropriate. The members should strive not to completely extinguish the lights, but only to make sure that the lights are completely invisible from the outside. Only those lights that cannot be prevented from leaking out should be extinguished.

Continuous Implementation, Extremely Cautious

Furthermore, before the police officers and members control the lights, they instruct residences and offices not to completely shield the lights, only to prepare to extinguish the lights. Many residents mistakenly believe that light control is a test period, and that all activities should be stopped during this period. In fact, future light control will not only be implemented for a few hours, but will continue for many days, so residents should be fully prepared to implement light control at any time without warning. The above-mentioned misunderstandings are naturally caused by the police officers and members being too eager. Once those concerned have a greater understanding of the meaning of the air defense exercise, all misunderstandings will be eliminated. In addition, the authorities will also issue clear instructions regarding the speed limit for cars during light control, and instruct residents not to linger on the road, but to walk on the sidewalk to avoid obstructing traffic. The public should be extremely cautious when shielding lights, because flammable materials such as paper are prone to catching fire near overheated light bulbs.

### The Public Works Department Announces the Ninth-Term Ration

The Public Works Department recently issued Announcement No. 6065, stating that the No. 8 coupon of the rice purchase certificate, which is used to purchase rice, is only valid until the 29th of this month and will be void after the expiration date. During the period from the 31st of this month to the 5th of September, rice stores and the Public Works Department's rice sales offices will only sell rice with the No. 9 coupon. At that time, each coupon will be used to purchase one liter of white rice and half a liter of broken rice from the rice store with the registered number marked on the coupon. The total price is three yuan and eight jiao. At the same time, the coupon holder can freely purchase one jin of flour for two yuan and three jiao.

### University Group's Scholarship to be Announced Tomorrow, Scholarship Standard to be Determined

The Shen Bao Reader Scholarship has been handling the review of the university group for several days, which is about to be completed. The scholarship list will be announced starting tomorrow, and payments will begin on Monday. This extended application has added more than one hundred people, all of whom have been officially certified by the school authorities. Therefore, the scholarship expenditure has increased by more than double. Therefore, the allocation of scholarships this time, except for a few with other necessary reasons, will be subsidized at 300 yuan, uniformly based on a standard of 250 yuan. Those who are less than 250 yuan will be subsidized accordingly. This method is also the same for the middle school group, that is, high school will be priced at 225 yuan based on nine dou of rice, and junior high school will be priced at 200 yuan based on eight dou of rice, as the highest standard. Although the current scholarship fund of this newspaper has exceeded 200,000 yuan, it is necessary to save a portion of the funds for winter vacation. Because during the winter vacation, due to the New Year holiday, donations are not as convenient as during the summer vacation, and the total expenditure of this scholarship will be around 160,000 yuan. This situation should be understood by the applying students and people from all walks of life who are enthusiastic about helping students.

Careful Handling

The review work for universities is very difficult. There are many people, the workload is huge, and the students are eager for help, and it is really unbearable to reject their earnest expectations. Moreover, they have all been certified by the school authorities. In order to be universal, in addition to determining the allocation standard, when there are still doubts after the interview, investigation procedures will be carried out to fully understand the actual situation of their families in order to determine whether to accept or reject them. A small part of the students who received assistance in the previous session and the new students in the third and fourth grades have not been interviewed, which does not necessarily mean that they will not be assisted. Similarly, those who have been interviewed and investigated are not necessarily guaranteed to receive assistance.

Points to Note

The following points are for the attention of all applicants and readers: Mr. Liang Weixin, I have received your letter and am very grateful for the points you have shown. This time, after the qualifying examination for the middle school group, there may have been some neglect of the family's economic situation. We will handle the points you have shown carefully. We will reply after the results are known. Please show the mailing address. Mr. Gong Zhenqu, the person you inquired about in your letter is from Kunshan, not from Nanjing. Mr. Ding Xianzhang, there are no free places in East Asia, so it is difficult to do so. Even the students who are assisted by this newspaper have to pay a considerable amount for other fees in addition to the tuition fees they receive. No. 51 Ding Shilin, you can decide on your own whether to change the subject. No. 89 Shen Heyuan, approved to change to Fifth China. No. 4 Cheng Xinan, approved to enter Chengyi Middle School's junior high school with two free places. Thank you to the Shiye Middle School on Nanyang Road No. 183 for donating five free places at all levels, and thirty half-fee places. No. 17 Shu Zhenguo, the original assistance of 100 yuan has been cancelled and changed to 20 yuan by Mingxin and 45 yuan by the Fourth China Supplementary School.

Donations Received Yesterday

Yesterday, we received the joint memorial ceremony for Yao's mother, followed by 2,000 yuan from all the staff of Jiu'an Trust Company, 100 yuan from Xiang Mengqi, 40 yuan from Xue Xuehai, 40 yuan from Zhu Tingqi, 40 yuan from Zong Boxuan, 30 yuan from Zhang Yunxi, and 20 yuan each from Kang Rongchang, Wang Zijian, Yuan Ziyi, Deng Fupei, Yao Yunfeng, and Zhang Fuwu, 10 yuan each from Qu Jiseng, Qiu Zongrun, Wang Yuyan, Xie Chengye, Yu Tenghua, Wang Jingshan, Liang Ziqing, Wang Ruisheng, Jiang Rongchuan, and Xiang Jiyu, totaling 2,470 yuan in savings coupons (the memorial ceremony for Yao's mother has now received a total of 15,520 yuan).

We also received 200 yuan from Ms. He Hanying and 200 yuan from Wu Erjuan for the scholarship, totaling 400 yuan in savings coupons.

The above two total 2,870 yuan in savings coupons. The balance yesterday was 201,422 yuan, 7 jiao and 2 fen, totaling 204,292 yuan, 7 jiao and 2 fen.

### Cracking Down on Impersonators of the "Village Clearing" Personnel Who are Taking Money Under False Pretenses

The "Village Clearing" work in the Shanghai area will begin soon. The relevant authorities in this city recently received a confidential report stating that after hearing this news, some unscrupulous people are impersonating the name of "Village Clearing" work to deceive citizens and take money under false pretenses. They are now actively investigating. It is said that recently, some unscrupulous people in the Xujiahui area, claiming to be Shanghai Municipal "Village Clearing" personnel, enter people's houses in groups of three or four and search from house to house. First, they order all the residents nearby to leave the house and force them to gather in one place. Then, they enter the room, rummage through the boxes and cabinets, and search everywhere. If they see valuables, gold, silver, etc., they immediately steal them. The residents there cannot distinguish whether they are indeed "Village Clearing" personnel, and they are deeply afraid that they will encounter their revenge after reporting them, so most of them keep silent and dare not speak out. In view of this, the authorities specially issued a statement yesterday, saying that they are currently actively investigating the truth about the impersonation of "Village Clearing" personnel. However, the "Village Clearing" work in Shanghai must begin in September, so it has not yet been implemented. Also, in terms of the area, the Xujiahui area is outside the work area, so these unscrupulous people are definitely not "Village Clearing" personnel. In short, the Xujiahui area is outside the scope of the Shanghai Taihu Southeast "Village Clearing" area and the Shanghai Municipal "Village Clearing" work area. If you encounter the same incidents in the future, I hope you will report them to the local security agencies immediately. This matter concerns the interests of the people, I hope everyone pays attention.

### Singapore Road Isolation Hospital Stops Admitting Patients

### Park Visitor Commits Suicide

Yesterday at around 7 p.m., a male corpse dressed in a black long gown was suddenly found on the lawn in Gujiazhai Park in the French Concession. After being reported to the Chinese police, they arrived at the scene to inspect and found an empty bottle of Lysol and a suicide note next to him. The note stated that he did not want to announce his real name, and only wrote "Chongming person, 40 years old, died."

Le Cuidi, a 20-year-old girl from Tongzhou, who lived at No. 26 Jules Paste Street in the French Concession, suddenly had the idea of dying for some unknown reason yesterday afternoon. She secretly swallowed bedbug poison in an attempt to commit suicide. After being discovered by her family, she was immediately sent to the hospital, but before she could be treated, she passed away.

Hong Jinshun, a 34-year-old man from Shaoxing, who had been a partner in Dingxinhao at No. 10 Yong'anfang, Yong'an Street in the French Concession, suddenly took poison (lysol) yesterday afternoon for some unknown reason to commit suicide. After being discovered, he was sent to the hospital, but the treatment was ineffective, and he soon died.

Zhang Ruifang, the daughter of Zhang Maochun, a local resident who lived at No. 27 Dalu Lane at the intersection of Luban Road and Xuehuali Road, had a quarrel with her father on the 24th because of buying shoes. The next day, she slept and refused to eat. After being persuaded by her family to no avail, she committed suicide. On the morning of the 26th, her mother, Zhang Shi, discovered that she had already died. She reported to the French police, who sent the body to the morgue. Yesterday, the parents of the deceased claimed the body for burial.

### Rent Disputes Should be Submitted to the Mediation Committee

The Public Works Department Information Office announced that the Bureau previously organized the Rent Mediation Committee in December of last year to adjust the relationship between landlords and tenants and mediate rent disputes between landlords and tenants. Since its establishment, the work has been quite intense, and a large number of cases have been submitted to the committee. All the cases, except for eleven that are still pending, have been concluded. Many landlords and tenants are extremely satisfied with the work of the committee, because political events have been resolved quickly and peacefully after being handled by the committee, unlike the delays and expenses of the usual legal procedures. Therefore, if there are any disagreements between landlords and tenants, they should submit a written application for mediation or arbitration to the committee's office No. 31-A at No. 239 Hankou Road.

As a result, except for Zhang Wenqing, whose death sentence was reduced to life imprisonment, the appeals of the others were rejected and sent to prison for execution. Now, Hao Jingcheng, Zhang Guochun, and You Yaoliang were executed yesterday morning. The police took Hao and the other two from the prison and escorted them to the court.

### A Record of Principal Hu's Baptism

— Xinan

Yesterday I wrote about the teachings of Confucius, and today I write about the Catholic faith.

The events occurred on the same day—August 27th. From a religious and journalistic perspective, it is equally worthy of record.

Years ago, among foreign students, three were renowned and achieved remarkable success in examinations: Ding Wenjiang, Weng Wenhao, and the current President of Aurora University, Hu Wenyao.

This time, Principal Hu was determined to be baptized. He spoke to his teacher, Bishop Hu, who happily said, "I have waited for you for forty years. Now that you have turned away from evil and returned to the truth, becoming a son of God, I will baptize you. But you must find a respected and virtuous Catholic to be your godfather." So, he consulted Mr. Zhu Zhiyao. On August 27th, a grand baptism ceremony was held at the church on Rue Lupan.

Baptism by a bishop is a significant event in the church, not taken lightly, and all rituals must be fully observed. Although I did not witness it and am not Catholic, Mr. Zhiyao's account is worth recording.

First, the person being baptized, accompanied by the godfather, stands outside the church door. The bishop stands at the doorway and asks: "Do you renounce the devil and the empty appearances, false glory of the devil? Do you believe?" The answer is "I believe." Second question: "Do you believe in one God?" Answer: "I believe." Third question: "Do you believe that God has three persons—the Holy Father, the Holy Son, and the Holy Spirit, and that the second person, the Holy Son, was born as a man named Jesus, who is the savior? "Answer: "I believe." To the fourth question: "Do you wish to be baptized and enter the Church?" Say, "I do." Three times asked and answered, each time, a "cross" is drawn on the forehead, the godfather also answers and chants the Scriptures, drawing a "cross." In this way, the bishop leads them into the church, using holy water from a pitcher, making a "cross" on the forehead, performing the baptismal rite, then performing the confirmation rite, applying oil to the forehead. The "firming" strengthens his faith, and the "energizing" strengthens his spirit. Then there are sermons and hymns. Only then does this grand ceremony end.

In the evening, Aurora University faculty and friends held a banquet, during which Dean Fang gave a speech, saying that what the faculty and friends of the school had been hoping for from Principal Hu for forty years has now been realized. Zhu Zhiyao was also invited to speak.

Principal Hu rose and replied, briefly stating that he had three motivations for being baptized: first, he was moved by the teachings of Confucius, who often said, "A gentleman is at ease in any situation," and "A gentleman is without worries or fears." How can one reach this state? Also, Yan Hui lived in a humble alley, eating only a basket of rice and drinking only a ladle of water, yet he did not change his happiness. How could he not change his happiness? The Great Learning says, "To renovate the people; to rest in the highest excellence." How can the people be renovated? Where is the highest excellence? Now he knows that trusting in God, who is all-wise, all-powerful, and all-talented, the master of all things, the soul has found its refuge. Without inner guilt, the spirit is at peace, and one can naturally be without worries or fears, at ease in any situation. Serving religion, abandoning lust, wealth, and willfulness, the meaning of Yan Hui's unchanging happiness is attained. From a worldly person to a heavenly person, after baptism, one is re-made as a person, and there is a basis for renovating the people. Always being close to God, that is resting in the highest excellence. Second, he was moved by Bishop Hu and Dean Cai because the clergy disregard fame and fortune, sacrifice themselves, and serve the public, showing the spirit of resting in the highest excellence. Third, he was touched by Mr. Zhiyao. Now he is fifty-seven years old and cannot procrastinate any longer, so he must catch up. This is the gist of Principal Hu's speech. Please forgive any inaccuracies in this record.

After hearing Mr. Zhiyao's words, I have a feeling that religion always persuades people to do good. As long as people have true faith, they will always obtain true and positive results. Mr. Zhiyao's spirit for religion can serve as an example for those who believe in religion. Principal Hu's character and determination to be baptized, in Confucius's words, can be described as "resolute, firm, reticent, and near to benevolence"!

### Chinese Stocks Waver, Rise Subsides Slightly

Yesterday's Chinese stock market saw many increases, but has now entered a consolidation phase. The promulgation of the "Provisional Rules for the Prohibition of Trading in Chinese Stocks" has dispelled the nervousness and speculation of recent days, and confidence has greatly stabilized. Public utilities are still under buying pressure and have risen sharply. The highest transaction price for Zhabei Water and Electricity was 33 yuan, up another yuan. Shanghai Electric reached the 30 yuan mark, up 2.5 jiao. In the department store sector, Wing On rose another 2 yuan. Sincere and New Sincere, which had risen too much in the past two days, have retreated slightly by 2.5 yuan. Innerwear rose 2.5 jiao. Great China Matches, with sellers watching, rose another 5 yuan, reaching the 190 yuan mark. Nanyang Tobacco rose 1 yuan. In the cultural sector, Commercial Press saw a high price of 275 yuan, then retreated, but still rose 2.5 yuan. World News has risen a total of 7.5 yuan in two days, while China News has fallen 2.5 yuan. In the pharmaceutical sector, New Asia retreated slightly by 2.5 jiao. Sino-French Friendship each rose 1 yuan. The stock price list for each market today is recorded below.

### Quiet Bond Market, Fluctuations Limited to 1-2 Jiao

Yesterday's unified government bond market lacked any special prospects, and confidence felt increasingly idle. Buyers hesitated, and sellers made even fewer advances. In addition, Chinese stocks rebounded, leading to the inevitable move of abandoning this for that. Therefore, the market atmosphere was unusually quiet, creating a brewing trend. The overall market fluctuation was only 1-2 jiao, and transactions were mainly from small retail accounts. The market atmosphere lingered, and major players seemed to be temporarily observing. If there is a stimulus, then the market trend will inevitably see a surge in fluctuations. Total transaction volume is estimated to be a weak 400,000-500,000 yuan. The list is shown below:

### Jewelry Gold and Silver: Absolutely No Change

Yesterday, the Shanghai jewelry industry's Daxin peer jewelry gold was still listed at 2,150 yuan per tael (purchase reduced by about 300 yuan). Peer-to-peer prices were between 1,880 and 1,890 yuan, with the final price at 1,880 yuan, the same as the previous day. Later, confidence was idle, and no further transactions were made. As for jewelry silver, it was still listed at 16 yuan per tael, with peer-to-peer prices at 10 yuan, 7 jiao, and 8 fen.

### Military Notes Stable

Yesterday's foreign currency market saw Japanese military notes quite stable. Peer-to-peer trading was sparse, with the final price at 5 yuan, 5 jiao, 5 fen, and 5.7 li, as the entry and exit price for operators. The retail prices of silver houses and small money shops also gradually converged and became consistent, with sales at 5 yuan, 5 jiao, and 6 fen, and purchases at 5 yuan, 5 jiao, and 5 fen, it is said.

Yesterday's Shanghai Money Industry Association's discount rate was 1 jiao and 2 fen, and has not changed. Newly allocated forwards and spot cash were traded at par, it is said.

### Piece Goods Rise and Fall Within Narrowing Range

Factory Cloth: Yesterday's market remained firm, without much glory or disgrace, but the situation had a high consolidation appearance. Therefore, Peach Blossom Ladies' Cloth opened at 257 yuan and 7 jiao and a half, fell to 8 yuan and 2 jiao and a half, and then someone came to absorb it. The midday close was 259 yuan, a continuation of 5 jiao better than the previous day. Fine Cloth also had no rise or fall. 16-pound Earth Coarse Cloth was still called at 179 yuan or 80 yuan, 12-pound Earth Fine Cloth at 160 yuan, Great Peng at 150 yuan, Three Sheep Serge New Orders at 6 yuan, Spot Goods at 5 yuan and 8 jiao and a half, Longevity Fu Silk at 5 yuan and 7 jiao and a half, Volleyball at 3 yuan and 9 jiao, and Magnolia Bleached Cloth at 160 yuan.

Eastern Cloth: The situation was stable, and the range of rises and falls was gradually narrowing. 12-pound Dragon Head Fine Cloth Factory Orders were continuously released due to warehouse rent issues as the end of the month approached. It opened in the morning at 175 yuan and a half, and the midday close fell to 174 yuan and a half, a drop of about 1 yuan. However, Fine Cloth such as Rainbow Ball and Flying Fish remained firm and unchanged. Rainbow Ball still required 163 yuan and a half, Flying Fish 160 yuan, and Four Gentlemen Serge always revolved around 7 yuan and 3 jiao, with trading clear and lifeless. The midday close price was 7 yuan, 2 jiao, 1 fen, and 9 and a half li, a slight increase of 5 li.

### Grains See Both Ups and Downs

The actual demand for beans was quite sluggish yesterday. Only more than sixty packages of Tianjin Red Beans were agreed upon, but no formal transactions took place.

Corn sales were not weak, confidence was good, and the market showed a rising trend. Yesterday, 280 packages of Wuhu Corn opened at a price of 110 to 112 yuan, and 100 packages of Dutch Corn opened at a price of 110 yuan.

Sweet Potato Dried Goods arrival and sales were mutually beneficial. The market initially leveled off and then strengthened. Yesterday, 30 packages of Jiangbei Sweet Potato Dried Goods in straw bags opened at a price of 107 yuan, and 40 packages in single-line bags opened at a price of 110 yuan to 110 yuan and 5 jiao.

Bran still felt that there was less supply than demand. Yesterday, 300 packages of Sanxin Small Package Bran for the May warehouse order opened at a price of 104 yuan, and the market trend was good.

Bean Cake trading has become increasingly deserted. Yesterday, 500 pieces of Kaishengji Bean Cake for the May Yoshida warehouse order opened at a price of 60 yuan, and the market lacked excitement.

### Coarse Sugar Shares Rise

Yesterday, the Sugar Merchants Cooperative Business Office's sugar shares saw a slight increase in market trading. The association's market assessment had slight fluctuations. Coarse Sugar Shares opened up 1 yuan, at 303 yuan and a half, and closed at 03 yuan. As a result, it still rose half a yuan. Red Sugar Shares opened at 301 yuan and 5 jiao. A total of 1,700 packages were traded.

### Red Date Trading Not Desolate

Red Date market prices have been at a fair level recently, so trading is open every day, and it is quite lively. For example, Special Dates from the Bei Chen goods store opened at 340 yuan, Date King at 310 yuan, Date Heads at 260 yuan, and Head Accounts at 230 yuan. South Chen Edible Date King opened at 290 yuan, Date Heads at 240 yuan, and Head Accounts at 200 yuan. In recent days, about nearly a thousand packages have been traded.

### Stage Plays Should Interweave Kunqu Opera

— Lord Nongdilou

Recently, due to the lack of film sources, most cinemas will switch to performing stage plays, especially spoken dramas, which are a realistic reflection of the movies, with pure Mandarin, making them easy to understand. However, they ultimately lack musical accompaniment, resembling mere literary sketches. Sitting in the theater is only enough for women to pass the time. Peiping Opera, on the other hand, is too noisy with gongs and drums, and the huqin is too harsh, neither of which is conducive to emotional well-being. Only Kunqu Opera is a refined and elegant art, with clear lyrics and beautiful sentences. The lingering charm after the performance is endless. Yuan and Ming dynasty playwrights valued filial piety and righteousness, and the "Pipa Story" and "Moon Pavilion" are why they have endured for thousands of years. At this time of theatrical change, if one or two scenes of Kunqu Opera could be added to stage plays, allowing the audience to be moved and inspired, it would not be a bad idea to change course. I will briefly outline my suggestions for playwrights.

Cast and Costumes: Zheng Chuanjian as the leading man, Zhao Chuandian as the crowned male, Zhou Chuan ying as the young scholar, Zhu Chuanming and Zhang Chuanfang as the five or six female roles, Shen Chuankun and Shao Chuan yong as the painted-face roles, Wang Chuanling and Fang Chuanyun as the martial male roles, Wang Chuanye as the leading female role, Wang Chuansong as the male clown role, and about fifteen people in the back stage. These actors should be divided into two teams, assigned to locations A and B, and rotate in performing. All comments from any parties are welcome. The costumes must be bright and colorful to satisfy the audience. If the performances are "Wandering in the Garden" and "Testing at Qiujiang," they will have a natural and graceful appearance, and evoke a sense of tenderness and pity.

Play List and Time: No matter if it is Peiping Opera or spoken drama, when half of the play is performed, there should be a break. Then, one or two scenes of Kunqu Opera will be performed for about fifteen minutes. For example, "Astonishing Change" and "Broken Willow" are only about twenty minutes long. After the Kunqu Opera is finished, the previous play will be continued, allowing the audience to change their taste. Amateur performers should also be welcomed, because amateur Kunqu performers often have no place to showcase their skills, which turns into learning without applying. It is precisely a way to promote this art.

### The Daylight Movie Machine

— Zhao

When we sit in the pitch-black cinema, quietly watching the film, although it is clear and understandable, we always feel somewhat unhappy about the surrounding darkness. I have often silently imagined that there could be "such a day" where we can enjoy movies without turning off the lights, or even using electricity, and at the same time, read the instructions and compare them with the plot on the screen, and listen to the dialogue from the speakers. How interesting that would be! I read in the newspaper that a Roman electrician, Emilio Vosi, recently invented a "daylight movie machine" that can play movies in broad daylight, and that in this era of energy conservation, the use of this movie machine can be predicted. The progress of film science can be said to be changing with each passing day, and various unexpected inventions are quite amazing. I deeply hope that the daylight movie machine can be seen in Shanghai soon.

### "Under the Peony Blossoms"

— Jumo

"Under the Peony Blossoms" is a tragicomedy. The Dahua Theater presented this film at the beginning of autumn, and it did not disappoint the audience. Of course, this is due to the serious production by the screenwriter and director, which made the entire film light and fluent, and always captured the audience's attention. At a time when Western films are at a critical juncture, and domestic films should strive to improve, "Under the Peony Blossoms" can indeed win the praise of movie fans. In the writer's opinion, in terms of the twists and turns of the plot and the delicacy of the handling, Mr. Sang Hu's "Wedding Night in the Bridal Chamber" is comparable, and the latter is even better than the former. For example, the average effort in acting, the clear photography, and the clear recording are all better later on.

The first half of the film describes the life of Shirley in school, and her deep love for Kemin. It is extremely smooth, especially with the interweaving of Han Langen and Yin Qiu, which adds a lot of humor to the first half of the play. For example, when Han Langen repeatedly looks at his watch in class, hoping to finish class sooner, and impatiently writes a note, which is passed to Chen Yunshang when the teacher is not paying attention. When Chen opens it, it says: "The class is still not over, the bell ringer is probably dead." The humor of the screenwriter makes those of us who have left school reminisce about the innocence and activity of student life, as if it were right in front of us. Chen Yunshang plays Shirley, a lively student, and the role suits her personality perfectly, making her performance wonderful. Especially when her father pretends to be a friend of Fang's deceased husband to rent a room from Mrs. Fang, Chen, because she dislikes his obscene behavior, shakes her head in refusal during the meeting, a kind of unspeakable anger, which is extremely realistic. Later, when the father sees that his beloved daughter's marriage has been decided, he takes a boat far away, and Chen and Gu Yelu send him off at the riverside, with tears rolling down. But when she looks back and sees her lover by her side, she can't help but smile, showing the little girl's feelings of joy and sorrow, which have entered a state of perfection. Gu Yelu's role as Kemin does not have many scenes, but he puts in a lot of effort. In the film industry, where there is a lack of young actors, Gu is still an excellent actor, although his figure and thick eyebrows still have room for improvement. Gu's expression often forcefully droops the corners of his mouth to the left and right, thinking that this is a sign of determination and hatred, but doing it too much will be excessive and seems not very beautiful. Jiang Ming is extremely competent in the play, but Bu Wancang seems to exaggerate the personality of this role too much, making it somewhat inhuman. The father certainly loves his daughter, and even pretends to be a friend of Fang Min's deceased husband. He should not be obscene and close to despicable towards Shirley, making Shirley suspect that this "old man" has ulterior motives. In the old man's heart, it is very clear that Shirley is his own daughter, and his attitude should be generous and his behavior should be upright. The screenwriter may want to use the suspicion between the father and daughter before the mystery is revealed to reflect the intimacy after the truth comes to light, so he does not hesitate to deliberately exaggerate, but this exaggeration, I must admit, is Bu Wancang's failure in the entire film.

Finally, I also want to talk about the opening title sequence. This time, soft satin is used as the background, and the title of the film, the cast, the staff, etc. are embroidered on the satin surface. Because the satin is reflective, the words are not very clear, which is the same problem as "Wedding Night in the Bridal Chamber." Some Western film title sequences are very meaningful and are always consistent with the plot. Mr. Bu must have seen many, and outsiders do not need to chatter here. At a time when domestic films are rising, he must have noticed this kind of detail. In short, this is a good new autumn film. If there is a perfect film review magazine in China, the editor will definitely praise it as the best film with four ★s.

Wang Meimei, the red dancer of the Paramount Ballroom, was honored as "Miss China" in 1941 for her superb dancing skills and beautiful posture. Recently, due to weight gain, she has temporarily left the film world, because she will soon be promoted to "Mrs. China." According to the beauty's words: "It is better to be a virtuous wife and good mother than to make friends with celebrities through dancing."

### Sharing the Same Boat

— He Jia Zhi

(8) What to Do

In the blink of an eye, A-Xing brought the boat closer. Mrs. Ye Er asked if today was colder or warmer than yesterday. Magpie said, "About the same as yesterday." He-Ma said, "There is river wind in the river, which is colder than on the shore. Mrs. Er, you should put on another piece of clothing. Put on that silk brocade cheongsam and then that navy blue velvet waistcoat." Mrs. Ye Er listened to He-Ma's words, changed into these two pieces of clothing, put her hands in the velvet waistcoat pockets, walked out, and instructed Weicheng, "Weicheng, you must not go out. I will be back in a while." Weicheng said, "Auntie, when you go to the Wei family, when you see Sister Cuizhen, bring her back. This is the first priority. As for how to punish Fei Changhe, that bastard who committed the crime of abduction, and how to question Wei Yunqing's crime of covering up, these can be left for tomorrow." Mrs. Ye Er also adopted Weicheng's proposal and asked Magpie to go with her. They walked to the riverbank in front. The boat was a medium-sized, unsheltered boat. Mrs. Ye Er and Magpie got on the boat. A-Xing first pointed the pole towards the riverbank, and the boat swayed to the middle of the river. Then, he rowed the oar into the river, and the sound of the oar was heard, and the boat moved straight forward like an arrow.

A-Xing said, "We will row the boat to the back river of the Wei family and go ashore without anyone knowing. Even if the Wei family wants to hide Miss Cuizhen, they will be caught off guard. If we row over from the main port in a grand manner, someone might see it and leak the news to Wei Yunqing first. People call Wei Yunqing the old fox. Wouldn't it be terrible if he hid Miss Cuizhen?" Mrs. Ye Er initially said that A-Xing was sneaky and did not agree, but later thought it was a good idea, so she listened to him and said, "Whatever you say." A-Xing rowed to a three-way intersection and tightened the oar, entering the small river. This river was exactly the back river of Wei Yunqing's house. In the blink of an eye, they saw a large bamboo garden in front. Magpie said, "That's the Wei family's house over there." A-Xing said, "Don't point your finger. Their house has two identical water bridges. I know." As he spoke, the large bamboo garden was getting closer and closer. A-Xing said, "There is no one on the shore, which is good." Mrs. Ye Er said, "Who cares if there is anyone? Row over there." The boat arrived at a water bridge on the east side and docked. A-Xing rushed to the front cabin to help Mrs. Ye Er ashore. (167) Movie star Hu Feng, after the summer, has also lost a lot of weight, but she is still lively and beautiful, no less than before.
