### Fall of Batavia, Capital of the Dutch East Indies Yesterday; Warfare Spreads to the Entire Island of Java; Japanese Forces 50 Miles from Surabaya

Tokyo, 6th (Domei) – The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced this morning that Japanese naval and army forces occupied Batavia, the capital of Java, at 9:30 PM last night.

Saigon, 6th (Domei) – According to a report from an American radio station, from Bandung (location of the Allied Forces General Headquarters in the Dutch East Indies), Japanese forces are now approximately 50 miles from Surabaya, the Dutch East Indies naval base.

New York, 6th (Reuters) – A Columbia Broadcasting Company reporter in Java reports that Dutch forces have retreated from Batavia, and transportation in the capital has been cut off.

Saigon, 6th (Haitong) – According to information received here, Japanese forces are advancing on Batavia, Surabaya, and Bandung in three routes. The Japanese forces in Indramayu are advancing southwest towards Bandung, having already reached Soepang. Another route is advancing west from Indramayu along the highway towards Batavia, having reached the Plora station, cutting off the railway from Batavia to Surabaya. The Japanese forces in Nambung are attacking Surabaya from the east, encountering no strong resistance along the way. Japanese paratroopers on Madura Island, opposite Surabaya, will encircle Surabaya from the sea, it is said. Bandung, 6th (Reuters) – The Dutch East Indies war report today states that fierce fighting is taking place throughout Java, and the Allied forces are still resisting bravely, but the continued Japanese air raids are proving effective. Japanese forces in eastern Java have occupied several places, including Kuckatai. The Japanese forces control the air, and as a result of continuous bombing, our forces are quite exhausted, and the situation is serious, but not hopeless. Bandung, 6th (Reuters) – The entire western part of Java has now been occupied by Japanese forces, and the Allied forces in various places have retreated. Major battles are expected to occur around Uyong. Heavy artillery fire has been heard here today. According to news this morning, after the Dutch and British forces conducted delaying tactics, Bogor has fallen. Bandung, 5th (Havas) – Railway transportation between here and Batavia has been directly threatened, and trains are moving very slowly. In addition, military authorities must give priority to the use of telephone and telegraph lines, making transportation between the two places even more difficult. Bandung, 5th (Havas) – The Dutch East Indies military authorities recently issued a war report stating that since the Japanese forces landed in Java, the war has spread to the entire island due to their adoption of the "infiltration strategy." This type of warfare makes it impossible for either side to establish normal fronts, so the positions of both sides are intertwined and difficult to distinguish. In short, the number of Japanese soldiers is far greater than that of the Dutch forces. Although the Dutch forces are fighting bravely and putting up strong resistance, the Japanese forces are still able to make progress. The reason why the Japanese forces were able to occupy several points in eastern Java is that they have control of the air. In addition, the Japanese forces have also occupied several places in western Java and are adopting a "pincer attack" on certain major cities, it is said.

Dutch East Indies Implements Thorough Scorched Earth Policy

London, 5th (Reuters) – Kessler, manager of the Dutch Shell Oil Company, stated that women in the Dutch East Indies are now following their husbands to avoid being captured by the Japanese forces. The scorched earth policy in the Dutch East Indies has been thoroughly implemented. Not only oil wells have been destroyed, but also mechanical tin factories, printing houses, repair shops, stores, and swimming pools have all been burned. All areas where the scorched earth policy has been implemented are a sea of ​​fire. I do not believe that Japan can repair the oil wells. Washington, (Japanese dispatch) – According to information obtained by the authorities, the destruction of oil refining facilities in the Dutch East Indies this time was extremely thorough. To utilize them, considerable effort would be required. The destruction of equipment is as important as the destruction of oil wells. With Japan's current equipment, it will be impossible to utilize the oil production of the Dutch East Indies in the short term to facilitate the implementation of its war plans, it is said.

British Newspapers Say the Situation in Java is Serious

London, 5th (Havas) – The newspapers here do not hesitate to acknowledge the seriousness of the situation in Java. For example, the Daily Express stated that the key to the battle of Java depends entirely on whether the air force can quickly arrive to reinforce. The right to control the airspace and sea has already been in the hands of the Japanese. If Java falls, Japan will inevitably achieve its goals. In other words, it will control the South China Sea and develop the rich resources of the Dutch East Indies colonies. Therefore, it is not impossible for Japanese forces to attack Australia, New Zealand, and India in the future, it is said.

London, 5th (United Press) – Dutch sources predict that Japanese forces will launch a second major offensive on the northern plains of Java to reinforce the existing attacking forces. The Dutch acknowledge that the defending forces cannot resist the large number of Japanese troops, and only hope that the defending forces can choose a place to hold firm, as McArthur did on the Bataan Peninsula. The Bandung area is the most ideal stronghold, as it is surrounded by high mountains, but they are not absolutely impassable. Various sectors in the Netherlands are now expressing concern, which is clearly due to the fact that the United States cannot provide the Dutch East Indies with greater assistance. However, this concern is only an emotional expression and does not imply resentment or dissatisfaction. What the Dutch are most concerned about is that the United States Navy has not been more active in this battle. In fact, the extent to which the Allied forces have made full use of shipping has reached its limit. Therefore, the United States cannot transport the aircraft ordered by the Dutch to the Dutch East Indies. American factories are now beginning to engage in wartime production work. Coupled with the needs of Britain and the United States, it cannot fully and promptly fulfill its obligations. Washington, 5th (Reuters) – Secretary of War Stimson announced that the United States has been using air force to reinforce Java with supplies in the past few weeks. Britain and the United States have not changed their original intention of assisting the Netherlands in its operations.

### Japanese Forces To Attack Australia; Remarks by Australian Commander Bennett

Sydney, 6th (Reuters) – Major General Bennett, commander of the Australian forces in Malaya, said to reporters in Sydney today that Japanese forces will attack Australia, not in months but in weeks. Therefore, Australians have the task of solving the problems currently facing the country, and we must act quickly.

Sydney, 6th (Reuters) – Australian Prime Minister Curtin announced today that former commander of the Australian forces in Malaya, Major General Bennett, will be assigned a position "commensurate with his talents" after a short rest.

Melbourne, 6th (Havas) – Minister of Aircraft Production Camerron announced today that if the countries of the democratic front do not expedite the supply of aircraft and other military equipment to Australia, tragedies will follow one after another. Various forms of assistance are mere lip service and do not materialize. Japan may turn to attack India, but I believe that Japanese forces will first covet Australia. Therefore, I urge all workers in aircraft factories to double their efforts, it is said.

Several Australian Ports Continue to Be Raided by Air

Tokyo, 6th (Domei) – The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced this morning that Japanese naval aircraft attacked Broom, a port on the northwest coast of Australia, on the 13th of this month, destroying 28 seaplanes. On the same day, it attacked Winter Harbor, destroying one transport plane with machine gun fire. Canberra, 5th (Havas) – The Australian Aviation Department recently announced that Port Moresby was attacked twice by Japanese aircraft this morning. The first air raid resulted in minimal damage and no casualties. The second air raid resulted in damage to several buildings that were hit by bombs, but it is said that there were also no casualties. In addition, Japanese aircraft bombed Darwin Harbor yesterday, limiting their attacks to British Air Force bases, and there were no casualties, it is said.

### Australia Will Send an Envoy to the United States

### Shimada Says the Japanese Navy is Prepared to Deal with Any Eventuality

Tokyo, 6th (Haitong) – Japanese Minister of the Navy Shimada stated today that the Japanese Navy is prepared to deal with any eventuality and will not disappoint the people of the country.

Tokyo, 6th (Haitong) – Japanese Minister of the Navy Shimada yesterday told the highest-ranking officials of various prefectures not to underestimate the strength of Britain and the United States, and urged the people of the country not to be complacent with their achievements. Everyone should provide assistance with raw materials, food, and industrial products. Although the Japanese forces attacking various places have won, the enemy can take guerrilla tactics at any time, it is said.

### British Prime Minister Will Announce Policy Towards India in the House of Commons; To Make India Completely Autonomous in Name; All Political Parties Will Also Resume Activities

London, 5th (Havas) – According to reliable sources here, Prime Minister Churchill may personally read an important government statement on the Indian issue when the House of Commons next convenes. It is heard that the War Cabinet has made a final decision on the legal status of India after considering the serious crisis threatening India. This decision in principle is said to exceed India's wishes and is of great significance. It is widely believed that India should be completely autonomous in name to inspire the people of India to cooperate in participating in the defense of the headquarters and the war efforts of the Allied countries. All Indian political parties will also resume activities. According to people in the parliamentary lounges, the Prime Minister's statement should first explain the government's policy on the post-war political system in India, then describe the specific steps for full cooperation between India and the Administrative Council under the leadership of the Governor-General of India, and finally hope that a basic agreement will be reached between Indian Muslims and Hindus. It is heard that this statement was drafted by the Indian Issues Research Committee, which was discussed by Prime Minister Churchill. The committee consists of several cabinet members, including Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Dominion Affairs Major Attlee, and Government Representative in the House of Commons Sir Stafford Cripps. At the same time, the Prime Minister of Punjab, India, Sir Khizr Hayat Khan, recently made a statement to visitors, hoping that the British government would avoid taking any action that Indians would interpret as an attempt to undermine India's future free institutions, as such an attempt would inevitably cause various unfortunate consequences. Eliminating all political disputes is also a matter of urgency, and the Chairman of the Muslim League, Barrister Jinnah, should occupy a seat on the Indian Administrative Council.

London, 5th (Havas) – Minister for Indian and Burmese Affairs Amery stated in the House of Commons today that the British government cannot publicly release any statement on the current situation in India under the current circumstances, but the government fully understands the importance of the Indian issue, it is said.

### Batavia and Buitenzorg

Batavia, the capital of the Dutch East Indies, fell yesterday. Looking back on ancient history, we know that in 414 AD, when the Jin Dynasty monk Faxian traveled to India and returned, he passed through Java and saw Chinese people living there. This shows the long history of overseas Chinese in the Dutch East Indies. Batavia is a modern city. Its outer port, Tanjung Priok, connects with various parts of the world by sea. Air transport connects Europe and Asia. In the Pacific War, this city's position is extremely important. After its fall, Australia is clearly threatened.

### US Secretary of the Army States Air Force Units Will Occupy an Important Position

Washington, 5th (Reuters) – Secretary of the Army Stimson stated that one of the main objectives of the reorganization of the US Army this time is to recognize that today's war is largely an air war. Therefore, the Army Department wants each military force to be able to perform its capabilities. We are now seriously engaged in ensuring that Air Force units will occupy an important position. The Secretary of the Army announced that the 7th and 2nd Armored Divisions will be established in 1942, with a total strength of approximately 10,000 men. The Army Department has now established an insurance system whereby officers and soldiers fighting on distant battlefields can apply for insurance from local radio stations. Some soldiers under General MacArthur on the Bataan Peninsula have applied for insurance using this method, and Britain has been using this system for a long time.

### Details of the Japanese Submarine Attack on Pearl Harbor Announced

Tokyo, 6th (Domei) – Imperial Headquarters specially announced the details of the heroic and sacrificial spirit displayed by the members of the Japanese Navy's "Special Attack Submarine Squadron" when they participated in the naval and air raid on the Hawaiian naval base Pearl Harbor on December 8 last year, severely damaging the US Pacific Fleet, for the first time. It is said that the submarine squadron secretly left a certain Japanese base, passed through the enemy's defense line, and then deployed in a predetermined position before launching a fierce attack, immediately sinking the Arizona-class battleship. The result of this night attack, immediately sinking the Arizona, was clearly seen by Japanese ships outside the harbor, at 4:30 PM on December 8 (8:20 PM Hawaiian time), just two minutes after the moon rose. A thunderous explosion occurred in Pearl Harbor, and flames soared into the sky, mixed with red-hot pieces of iron, scattering in the air. Within a few minutes, the flames disappeared, and the enemy's anti-aircraft guns opened fire, apparently mistaking the attack by the special attack submarine squadron for an attack by the Japanese Air Force. At the same time, at 6:11 PM (10:40 PM Hawaiian time), the Japanese side received a telegram from a special attack submarine reporting that the mission had been accomplished successfully. After 7:14 PM on the same day, the radio signals from the special attack submarine squadron stopped, so it is believed that each submarine in the squadron had either exploded or been sunk by the enemy. The squadron had received orders to return after completing the attack, but none returned. This spirit of sacrifice, disregarding one's own safety in order to achieve its purpose, is highly commendable, it is said.

### Price Controls on Cigarettes in Both Concessions to Be Implemented Soon; Announcement to Be Made Once Arrangements Are Finalized; Wing Tai Tobacco Company Begins Selling Cigarettes with Military Scrip

The English-language North China Daily News reported that the Municipal Council criticized the report this morning (6th) that price controls on cigarettes and tobacco in both concessions would be implemented starting today, stating that this matter is indeed under discussion, but has not actually been finalized. Once the arrangements are finalized, the rumored method may be implemented, but the rumor that arrangements have been finalized and implementation will begin today is premature. At the same time, retail sales of cigarettes in the International Settlement and French Concession south of the Suzhou Creek will still be calculated in legal tender.

Japanese Control

The Shanghai Times reported that, according to Domei News Agency last night (5th), after the Japanese side reached a compromise with the Municipal Council and the French Municipal Council, the retail prices of cigarettes and tobacco in the International Settlement and French Concession will be set by the authorities. Starting today (6th), prices will be calculated in Japanese military yen. Observers say that some cigarette and tobacco prices are now four times higher than before the war. Calculating in military yen will greatly reduce their prices. This measure follows the precedent of the Japanese Consulate-General, which approved the official prices set by the Central Tobacco Distribution Association on March 2 and instructed Japanese tobacco merchants to comply.

Military Scrip Calculation

The Wing Tai Ho Tobacco Company, which previously held a monopolistic position in both concessions as the exclusive direct distributor of British and American cigarettes, has recently been reorganized into the Wing Tai Tobacco Company, managed by Chinese. The company has designated 100 retail tobacco merchants to sell cigarettes at prices calculated in military yen, as announced by the Tobacco Association four days ago. Although the British American Tobacco Company's factory in the city has been under Japanese control since the outbreak of the Pacific War, cigarette prices have skyrocketed due to reduced production and shortages of both inventory and raw materials. Regarding the price controls on cigarettes being calculated in military yen, reliable sources claim that this is due to the instability of the current legal tender. If the legal tender stabilizes, the price controls will be changed to legal tender, it is said. It is expected that the Japanese Consulate-General, the Municipal Council, and the French Municipal Council will soon issue orders regarding retail cigarette prices and warn tobacco merchants that they will be punished if they raise prices.

Increase Efficiency of Police Work
Eliminate Illegal Activities
Deputy Inspector General of the Five Islands Instructs Officers

On February 28th, at 2 PM, Deputy Inspector General of the Public Concession Police Department, Gotō, took office as the head of the Criminal Division and Special Higher Police Division. He summoned his officers and gave instructions, with the main points being to increase the efficiency of police work, eliminate major crimes, and suppress corrupt practices among merchants. His instructions are as follows:

"I, Gotō, humbly serve as the head of the Criminal Division and Special Higher Police Division, a position of great responsibility. At the beginning of my tenure, I would like to offer a few words of encouragement to my colleagues, hoping to ensure public safety and maintain the efficiency of police work, in order to meet the needs of the current situation and enhance the peace and well-being of citizens. In this extraordinary period, I hope that all levels of detectives can fulfill their duties and pay particular attention to the following points:

All major crimes that endanger the safety of citizens' lives and property, such as political terrorism, murder, armed robbery, and extortion, must be severely suppressed by all possible means.

Any illegal elements, regardless of nationality, who take advantage of the situation to engage in improper activities, attempt to subvert order, or impersonate officials or use official names to carry out actions that harm the people, will be severely punished without leniency.

Greedy and lawless merchants who only seek profit and often endanger the safety of citizens' lives should also be severely suppressed. As for unemployed vagrants, they should be sent back to their hometowns immediately.

The term "citizens" mentioned in the above points refers to people who contribute to the welfare of this city and have a clear understanding of the current situation. Others, such as those who are idle, regardless of their wealth, should not be called citizens. In order to achieve the above objectives, detectives of all levels, regardless of nationality, must fulfill their duties, respect themselves, and be mindful that if they engage in evil deeds or corruption, damage the reputation of the police force, or fail to perform their duties effectively, they will be severely punished according to police regulations or dismissed from their positions. Do not say that you were not warned in advance."

A Group of Early Birds in the Park (2) Ye Jingfeng

To talk more about this group of birds in the park, they are truly fortunate birds, worthy of envy, especially by those who toil all day long and never see the light of day, such as the small clerks who crawl to the office from attics or lean-tos, and the teachers in the alley schools. This western district park, "Jessfield Park", is far more beautiful than other parks in terms of area, layout, structure, and scenic environment. It has an artificial mountain of dozens of feet, a fish pond and marsh of two or three acres, with a small stream attached; three large groups of flower gardens, each with its own structure; several lawns, the largest occupying more than twenty acres; and a forest of about ten acres in size. In addition, there is a Western restaurant, a temple-style building, an ancient pavilion, and a children's playground; as for scattered thatched pavilions, rockeries, and flowerbeds, there are dozens of them. The main roads are divided into two types: those paved with cement and those paved with asphalt. The paths are divided into stone-paved and earth-cushioned ones. To talk about the flowers, plants, and trees, that would require another article to elaborate. There are towering trees, ground-hugging cypress trees, strange trees with intertwined roots, and famous and exotic flowers blooming in all seasons... Such an environment gives the early birds unlimited appreciation and enjoyment, how can one not say they are fortunate, how can one not envy them? But what kind of "birds" are these?

Speaking of this group of birds, if we want to describe them in detail, we must proceed by area. As soon as you enter the park gate, there is a cement avenue that leads straight north to a large bridge. We will use this bridge as a boundary to divide the entire park into two major areas: the north and the south. First, we must talk about the group of "Tai Chi" birds in the northern area of the bridge. This group of birds numbers no less than thirty. Their main base is on the way through the forest to the zoo, with a small thatched pavilion as the center of their activities.

There are quite a few special characters in this group of "Tai Chi" birds. One of them is an old bird, nearly seventy years old, of the Antarctic Immortal type; with a white beard flowing down his chest, a youthful complexion and white hair, he looks like a celestial being from fantasy. The only flaw is a hen-like voice, which is sharp and hoarse, hoarse and sharp. Listening to his daily conversations, he has a deep understanding of medicinal properties, he is a contemporary Bian Que, and he seems to know a little bit about the secrets of longevity. Although he does not practice Tai Chi, the Tai Chi birds respect him quite a bit.

There seem to be two main figures in this group. One is a martial arts master in his fifties, with a bald head. Although this bird does not often perform, from the outside, his martial arts seem to have quite a history - his eyes are bright, his body is tall and strong, and his voice is as loud as a bell - walking two steps is like the teacher in "Qing Ding Zhu"; his body is half-slanted, and his waist is stiff. Presumably, he is the chief instructor of this group (?). The other one, comparatively speaking, is a small bird that depends on others; thin, small, and refined, with glistening eyes. It looks like he is the director of the whole group. His Tai Chi skills are probably at least ten years old; it seems to be purely the Wu style. Every day, as long as it is not stormy weather, regardless of the cold or heat, this little bird can always be seen there at around 6:30 in the morning, practicing on his own or instructing the group of birds.

The Municipal Council Announces Corn Sales Method
All Rice Shops Should Pay and Collect Sales Permits on Monday
Each Person is Limited to One and a Half Sheng, Selling for $1.70

The Municipal Council's Grain Management Committee announced yesterday that rice shops should collect sales permits from the Grain Management Committee at Room 703 of the Municipal Council Building next Monday morning (the 9th). The sales permits specify the number of corn packages allocated to each rice shop. Therefore, after receiving the sales permits, the rice shops should pay the Grain Office on the same day.

All rice shops should be informed that the method of allocating corn to each rice shop is as follows: for each allocation of 25 bags of rice, 20 bags of corn will be allocated; for each allocation of 20 bags of rice, 15 bags of corn will be allocated. Each bag of corn weighs 204 pounds, equivalent to 195 catties on the market scale, or slightly less than 1.22 shi on the metric scale. The total price sold to the rice shops is $146.76.

This corn is being milled by the Lihe Foreign Firm and will be delivered to each rice shop before the 13th of this month, so that it can be sold universally from the 13th onwards. Each person is limited to purchasing one and a half sheng, selling for $1.70 in national currency. Queuing and numbering are also required, and fingers must be dipped in color after purchase. Repurchase is only allowed on the following Friday. It is hoped that the common people will mix this corn with rice for cooking, as its properties are equal to rice and its nutritional value is also the same as rice.

Returning Home from a Wedding Feast
Suddenly Attacked by an Assassin

Weng Yuanwen, a 38-year-old Ningbo native, is engaged in ginseng trading. Yesterday morning, Weng went to a friend's house in Xinjing, northwest of Shanghai, to attend a wedding feast. He returned home at 4 PM. When he passed near the intersection of Kaixuan Road and Daxi Road, someone suddenly opened fire on him. Weng was caught off guard and was shot in the head and abdomen, causing him to fall to the ground bleeding profusely. The assailant fled without a trace. Afterwards, someone summoned a car to send Weng to the hospital for treatment. His injuries are severe and his life is in danger.

Rumor that Hongkou will Operate
Trolleybuses

After the operation of streetcars in Hongkou, there is also news that trolleybuses will be operated in mid-month. According to a reporter from Datong News Agency, the trolleybuses in Hongkou will still be an independent unit and will not be connected to the streetcars south of the bridge. The designated route is: Szechuan Road Bridge to Tiantong Road and then to Huade Road. It is reported that the streetcars in Hongkou are borrowed from the streetcar company. Whether the trolleybuses will also be borrowed from the streetcar company is unknown. According to inquiries from the company's transportation department, the department has not yet received such news. Currently, all of the company's trolleybuses are in operation. The number of streetcars on routes 6 and 7 is reduced due to the borrowing of vehicles by Hongkou, and they are not planning to restore the original number. All other routes are operating as usual.

How to Cook Corn Rice

"Osmanthus Rice" is not rice cooked with osmanthus flowers. The so-called "osmanthus" is corn, or maize, pearl rice. In Ningbo and Shaoxing, it is called "six grains", meaning grains other than the five grains. Therefore, as a food, it also has rich nutritional value. When you buy it, because it has already been crushed, it can be cooked in rice. After cooking, when you open the pot, you will see fresh yellow corn interspersed in the snow-white rice, which is beautiful in color and has a faint fragrance. Its taste is very good, very much like osmanthus flowers and rice, so it is named Osmanthus Rice. Because this is a brand-new dish, it is worth mentioning the method of cooking. According to the author's experience, corn should be cooked first. After the corn is cooked, it should be cooked with white rice. This way, you can't tell the difference between rice and corn. If you put them in the pot at the same time, the rice will be cooked while the corn is still hard. Although it looks like Osmanthus Rice, it tastes like yellow sand rice. (Qi Ying)

Robbery at Yang Taixing Hotel
Police and Thieves Fight
One Thief Dead, One Wounded

The Yang Taixing Hotel at 377 Dagu Road was suddenly invaded by five armed robbers at 10:20 PM on the 5th. They searched and robbed $970 in cash. At that time, a hotel employee, Zhao Kai, climbed over the wall and shouted for the arrest of the robbers. The nearby Chinese and Western police officers gathered in response. At that time, the robbers were carrying the stolen goods and fleeing. They encountered the police and each drew their guns and opened fire. For a time, gunshots crackled and bullets flew. One robber, named Shen Weiting, was shot dead on the spot. Another robber, named Chen Shichang (25 years old, from Suzhou), was injured in the buttocks and fell to the ground and was captured. A Chinese police officer, No. 2940, was also shot in the leg. The dead body was sent to the morgue for examination, and the injured were sent to the hospital for treatment. A Mauser pistol, an automatic pistol, four bullets, and a coat were seized and taken to the police station, pending interrogation after the injured thief recovers.

A Huge Plunge in Public Bonds Before Market Close

The public bond grey market suddenly experienced a huge plunge at the closing of yesterday's market. This was entirely due to the selling by Da Kangcheng, while smaller companies bought in. At the opening, Lianyi Yu Da bought in large quantities. Class C bonds opened at $67.10, rising to 30 cents, and then falling to 70 cents, fluctuating for a long time. Da Kangcheng and Tong Kang slowly released bonds. At the close, after the closing price of Class E bonds was set, when setting the closing price of Class D bonds, Da Kangcheng surged, even though Zhongfu had a thicker appetite, other companies such as Yuxing Shunli Xiekang had a weak appetite, and the market did not rise again. Class D bonds barely maintained the $60 mark, while Class C bonds also fell sharply, breaking through the $7.00 and $6.00 marks. Class B bonds also only maintained $7.00. There were fewer sellers of Class A bonds, and Lianyi was still buying over 100,000, so it was able to stand firm. Fortunately, there were many swap transactions in the market, so many people were still buying Class D bonds, but because they needed to cash out Class C bonds, the price went down again. It is said that Da Kangcheng represented a small bank in selling, resulting in a large volume. Only when the seller stopped a little could the price be expected to rise again. As a result, there was a general decline, ranging from 15 cents to $1.75. The turnover was about $700,000. A brief table is listed below.

Military Notes Rise Sharply, Then Slightly Rebound

Yesterday's cash black market first rose and then suddenly rebounded slightly. Japanese military notes rose, and people's hearts were still optimistic, but gold bars were constantly being shipped from other ports to Shanghai, supplied by Hakka gangs. The supply and demand were still in balance that day. Although the price had already broken through $14,000, the rise was limited and there was a lot of consolidation. The turnover was still scarce. At the opening in the morning, each tael (ten taels) was $130 higher. A certain silver shop first bought ten taels from Chengji for $14,100. Suddenly, it was seen that the silver shop gangs were buying non-stop, and securities firms and retail investors were scrambling to buy. Sellers waited and watched, and the price continued to rise by $350, reaching a high price of $14,450. Cash shops came to sell forcefully again, and Yongfengyu and the silver shop gangs also sold. It was seen to rebound by slightly $300, falling to $14,150. A certain gold shop and another securities firm strongly bought in, suddenly raising the price again to $14,300. Cash shops and Hakka gangs sold. At noon, the market closed at $14,150, which was $180 higher than the previous day. There was a fluctuation of $350 that day. The turnover was still scarce. Jewelry gold was quoted at $50 higher per tael, at $1,500 (buying in reduced by $150). Silver was quoted at $14. The black market buying and selling price was $12.79. Silver coins were quoted at $7.68 for buying and selling, it is said.

Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw the British and American gold pounds each rise by $5, the former to $360 and the latter to $370. American dollar notes retreated slightly to $16.80. Hong Kong notes continued to fall to $2.85, with large notes reduced by one dime. Military notes once rose to $0.83, and finally to $4.75.

Banking Preparatory Committee
Reduces Payment Handling Fees

Extends Time for Sending Foreign Bank Checks on Saturdays

The Joint Preparatory Committee of the Shanghai Banking Industry has been collecting a payment handling fee of $0.50 per $10,000 in national currency from the current account holders of each bank and firm since October 1st of last year. Although the amount is very small, each bank still considered the burden too heavy and requested a reduction. The committee has specially reduced it by half, uniformly collecting $0.25 per $10,000 in national currency on a temporary basis.

In addition, the time for each bank and firm to send payment notes from foreign banks to the committee for collection on Saturdays was originally set before 11:00 AM. In order to facilitate the sending of payment notes from foreign banks received on that day to the committee for collection, starting from March 7th, it has been changed to before 10:45 AM.

Coarse Yarn Rises Even More Sharply

The cotton yarn market continued to rise, but the trend for fine yarn was relatively flat. However, coarse yarn saw a rise. This is because the price of Japanese yarn and cloth is rising steadily, so people's hearts are optimistic, and the market is stable. The opening price for 20s Double Horse was $2,640, which soon rose to $2,670. Then, due to profit-takers selling, it loosened to $2,605, but the market sentiment remained stable. The closing price was $2,650. 42s Blue Phoenix $5,830 to $5,800, 42s Wool Butterfly $5,610, 42s Three Horses $5,750, 80s Sunlight $20,000, 60s Bull Head $9,800 to $9,900, 23s Golden Rooster $2,390, factory orders, 20s Moon Harp $3,000, 20s Blue Phoenix $3,255, 20s Celestial Maiden $2,950, 20s Double Tiger $3,000, 20s Red Kui Xing $2,850, 22s Double Earth $2,780, 16s Red Kui Xing $2,630 to $2,650, 16s Airplane $2,650, 14s Golden Pagoda $2,520, 10s Boy Scouts $1,940.

Purely Psychological Trading
Cloth Prices Rise More and More Fiercely

Factory Cloth
Yesterday, the market continued to rise. In the afternoon, stimulated by the sharp rise in Dongbu cloth, people's hearts turned optimistic, and asking prices increased even more. There was purely psychological trading, so actual transactions were still scarce. This is because the retail market on this street was sluggish due to continuous cloudy and rainy days, and most people were buying for speculative hoarding. Customers from Ningbo purchased more than 100 pieces of bleached cloth, printed cloth, silk fabrics, colored cloth, and fine cloth. More than 500 pieces were traded on this street. The selling prices of both white and colored goods rose by $2 to $4 per piece. 16-pound Printed Butterfly coarse cloth $138, 8-pound Zhenzhong $70, Flying Goose coarse twill $110, Earth fine cloth $114, Fugui fine cloth $110, 190 Chick Shirting $182, Mermaid bleached cloth $117.50, White Cat printed cloth $105.

Dongbu Cloth
The rising trend continued. The new factory order for 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth opened in the morning at $129.50, and gradually rose to $131.25. The market rose even more violently later, and the evening closing was $136, which was $6.75 higher per piece than the previous day. Because the merchants had no new orders, and the supply was scarce, the rising trend was even more fierce. The mid-range Flying Fish Color Ball rose to $124, Yanghe $123.50, Trumpet $121, Five Blessings Double Fish $120. Twill Five Blessings Double Fish rose to $109, Four Gentlemen Drill, October to December orders $4.47, Red List new tax $4.38, still extremely scarce.

Food Prices Continue to Rise

The large batch of raw soybean oil ordered by the oil industry wholesale office has been arriving in succession. Yesterday, 1,861 barrels of Qingdao raw oil were transported to the Osaka Wharf in Hongkou. It is said that the later batches are still en route. Once the customs procedures are completed, they will be sold and distributed. As for now, the office is still supplying refined oil and rapeseed oil on a daily basis, with the retail price at $3.10 per market catty, and has not changed. Oil frying businesses and restaurants are currently in the process of registering in order to determine the amount of supply.

Because the source of soybeans is not smooth, people's hearts are thinking of higher prices, so the prices have uniformly increased by $2 to $3. It is said that 150 bags of Tianjin Jinyuan were sold, priced at $170 to $173, 50 bags of Pudong Du soybeans, priced at $162, 110 bags of Changzhou Niupi Yellow, priced at $157 to $158, over 100 bags of Wuhu Yellow Soybeans, priced at $157, one carload of Huaiqiu Yellow Soybeans, priced at $156, 60 bags of Sangyuan Yellow Soybeans, priced at $160, 200 bags of Chongming Sand Yellow, priced at $152 to $156, also over 100 bags of Red Beans, priced at $129, also over 200 bags of Sand Silkworms, priced at $90, 50 bags of Benniu Red Beans, priced at $123.

Red Grain and Raw Peanuts are Selling Very Well on This Street and Prices Have Risen Again by $3 to $5. It is said that six carloads of Kaoming Red Grain were sold, the high-quality goods priced at $92 to $96, also medium-quality goods at $89, 100 bags of Yangzhou Raw Peanuts, priced at $305.

Even Young Children in Troubled Times Are Not Guilty  Yuan, Return Quickly

In such times and places, unless you're a fashionable speculator with a bulging belly finding it all quite amusing, every ordinary citizen has a subconscious feeling of shaking their head about life. It's a fact that life is hard, and it's definitely not ideal to keep living. There's no way out, so more people are "breaking the law." In small ways, it's tossing copper coins for gambling; in big ways, it's outright robbery. This poses a serious problem for public order.

People stealing bread has existed since ancient times, especially in times of chaos. Why? To feed themselves. However, this betrays "humanity" and violates the law. So our God declares them guilty. In ordinary times, they are indeed law-abiding citizens, but once they commit a crime, they become ferocious villains. Perhaps they have children at home crying for food. They can barely cope by tightening their belts, but eventually, they can't bear to hear the cries of the young children. This is too cruel.

So they harden their hearts and become criminals. It's strange that they have the courage to do things they wouldn't normally do, but they don't have the courage to listen to their children's cries of hunger. I think, the tragic stories written by Xiao E have a realistic basis. If adults commit crimes for their children, are the children the root of the evil? I dare to say loudly: the poor children are definitely not guilty. Their hunger is instinct, and their cries are instinct. The only regret is that they haven't yet learned the customs of the world when they first arrive. Some adults, because they can't bear to hear their cries, harden their hearts and even disregard their flesh and blood, using the most cruel means to destroy these small creatures. This goes beyond crime and is even more unforgivable. But it's a common sight in the real world. One can find the black handprints of evil in the vast piles of children's corpses. Torture, hanging, suffocation, freezing, drowning. Everything that can be done to an adult can be done to a child. Otherwise, why are there so many children's corpses?

In every corner of society, you can see children being slowly abused: children being made to grind rice under the threat of a big man; parents eating white flour and urging their children to chase rickshaws; some technical experts training some small technicians in a short period to pick people's pockets; or children pretending to be dead in adults' arms; it's also adults who are wielding whips and shame on children.

Seeing a drawing of a mother's back, titled "Hunger," a sudden sadness arises. I'm not just sympathizing with this mother, but the children who weren't discovered in the picture are even more worth remembering. Is this because the "heart of a child" has moved me? There's also a painting by Feng Zikai: an adult holding a knife to kill a lamb, with a child next to them wailing and stopping the adult's hand. The title seems to be: "Saving a Friend." This is also one expression of the heart of a child. A news report stated that a child, only nine years old, was carrying a dipper of rice, wandering on Avenue Joffre, crying silently. It turned out that they had come to Shanghai with their parents to sell rice and had gotten lost. Of course, the fate of the children of poor families is different from those sitting in Kromin strollers being pushed down Avenue Joffre by nannies. But should this only be an object for poets to sing about: "Pity the child of a poor family; the sorrow of leaving the child gnaws at the belly"? Please think about it again, adults.

Me and the Student Cafeteria
Day Student

Every time the fourth class comes around, my stomach starts to rebel. I don't hear what the professor is saying, I'm just calculating the problem of eating.

Eating out is always an unpleasant thing. I certainly don't dare to go to high-end restaurants. If I squeeze into a small greasy restaurant, the waiter will come to the seat and draw a few circles on the table with a black, sticky rag. When I decide to eat a "half"-full bowl of the cheapest noodles, the bills in my pocket are already destined to have two dollars that don't belong to me anymore.

Unintentionally, I stepped into the YMCA student economic cafeteria. This place is a different world: pink walls, white tables and chairs, a few chefs in white clothes and white hats standing behind a white counter. As soon as you enter, you take a porcelain tray, rice bowl, dish, etc. Just follow the people in front for a few steps, and the dishes and soup in the tray and bowl are filled by those white "angels." Then put the tray on the last counter, calculate the bill, and it's only $1.60 (take out your student discount card and you can deduct twenty cents). Then pick up the tray, find a seat, and have a full meal.

Wipe my mouth and walk out. There are many forms on the corridor wall outside the cafeteria. I checked them all over and found that the meat dish, vegetable dish, and soup I just ate contained vitamins A, B, C...

Well, I'm relieved about my health and my wallet.

Clothes Hanger
Childhood Friend

"People need clothes, Buddha needs gold." Walking into a bathhouse is like returning to the primitive age, which is fine. But people have three hundred and seven bones, and they spend more days standing than lying naked in a bathtub, which is just one part of life. Usually, they have to be a clothes hanger. After all, nude sports still need to be promoted, while wearing a crisp tie has become a step before going to a banquet.

But, let's not mention making new clothes now. From the invoices of department stores to the bills of the Su Guang clothing stores, they add up to forty or fifty dollars, and they're not silk or cotton fox fur robes, nor wool gabardine clip robes, but wearing them still has a rather "shabby" feel. Running to Shilu to find old ones, wearing them either makes you look like a lantern, or tightens you up like a toad. They also have soap stains. Wearing them, your friends laugh at you for being "improperly sourced." But nearly twenty yuan in legal tender has already come out of your pocket. Isn't that unjust?

Clothes. We can't make new ones this year, so we'll patch them up, sew them, alter them, and piece them together. Father passes them on to brother, and brother passes them on to younger brother. We'll just muddle through to avoid exposure and keep warm. But even seeking cleanliness is not easy. The price of Xiangmao solid roots has skyrocketed, and housewives are also frowning over the distribution of soap. If you don't wash away the dirt, not to mention hygiene, economically speaking, harboring dirt makes clothing more easily damaged. Conversely, soap consumption is alarming, not to mention the washing of sheets, pillows, and handkerchiefs.

Friends who wear Western clothes feel even more difficult. The cost of sending them to the dry cleaners for a single cleaning used to be enough to buy a good stiff-collared shirt. If you want your shirt and tie to be a little crisp and pretty, Western ironing uses electricity, while "local ironing" uses coal. At a time when people are lining up to buy coal, and the kitchen smoke is intermittent, it would be a waste.

These days, it's difficult to eat, and it's also difficult to be a clothes hanger.

Sharing the Same Boat Through Storms
He Jiazhi

(2) Sorrow and Joy

The boatman told Guoqi that they were almost at Huagang. All three of them felt that the boat was rocking so fast tonight. Guoqi opened the door of the middle cabin connecting to the room cabin, and then opened the doors of the room cabin and the aft cabin, and asked the boatman. Guofang was busy looking at her watch; Weicheng also put his face close to the glass window, which was not much different in size from his face, to look at the sky outside. Then, Guoqi drew back and said, "Although the wind and rain were heavy just now, because the wind was a tailwind and the water was also with the current, the boat traveled fast. Now it's only five or six li away from Huagang. It won't be an hour before you can get to Huagang, Weicheng. I told the boatman that if it's not dawn when we get to Huagang, we'll stop at Huagang. After my friend gets ashore, you can set sail again." Guofang said, "Brother's method is right. Is it still raining now?" Guoqi said, "It's not raining anymore. It looks like tomorrow will be sunny." Guofang laughed, "Brother's umbrella can be lent to Weicheng. Anyway, in the first month, we're still going to Huagang." Guoqi said, "It's not raining anymore, so why would he need an umbrella?" Guofang said, "Heaven is not made by brother. Maybe it's not raining now, but it might rain again later. His home is not like our home: when we get to Shuangqiao, we take one step and get ashore; take another step and we're home. When he gets to Huagang, he still has to walk a bit to get to Shidetang. If it starts to rain on the muddy road, wouldn't it be better to have an umbrella? Why didn't brother and Weicheng think of this?" Weicheng laughed, "Thank you, you've thought of everything so thoroughly for me. But I don't think it will rain again, or if it does rain, there are many people who know me in Huagang. I can always borrow rain gear." Guofang's attitude was simply like a lawyer in court. She wouldn't stop until the closing arguments were declared. She said again, "You don't think that when you get to Huagang, it will just be dawn, and people won't be up yet. Where are you going to borrow rain gear? How come brother and Weicheng didn't think of this?" She reached into the room cabin and pulled out an umbrella. Weicheng thanked her again, and he and Guoqi laughed. (15)

The prices of pork, chicken, and duck have also decreased slightly, while other commodity prices have not changed much.

### Dr. Fu's Funeral Held Yesterday

Dr. Ferguson, Vice President of Renji Hospital, passed away on the morning of the 4th of this month at the age of 44. The funeral service was held at the church opposite Jing'an Temple yesterday at 3:30 PM. Over a hundred Chinese and foreign friends who knew him attended. Reverend White, the General Secretary of the London Missionary Society, officiated, and Reverend Tang Renxi delivered a eulogy. It stated that Dr. Ferguson had dedicated himself to God during his lifetime, focusing on saving lives and helping the world. He had long disregarded life and death, and his service extended beyond the material world to the spiritual realm. Dr. Ferguson originally had the grand ambition of changing the hearts of the people of Shanghai, hoping to make it a spiritually and morally pure city. He gathered like-minded individuals and advanced in this direction, disregarding personal gain or loss, day after day. As a result, countless people have obtained the true essence of Christ. His contribution to Shanghai can be considered significant. Colleagues who spent time with him day and night were deeply influenced and spiritually uplifted by him. Those who stumbled and rose again were countless. Gratitude in private relationships is beyond words. After the service, six close friends escorted the coffin to the cemetery for burial.
