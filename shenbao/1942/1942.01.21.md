### Main Battlefront in Malaya: Fierce Fighting in Segamat, Dogfight in Johor Airspace, Saigon Reports Japanese Offensive in Java

Tokyo, 20th (Domei News Agency) - The Japanese forces, which had been advancing on Singapore, have today shifted their offensive, aiming to break the resistance on the Malay Peninsula and consolidate their positions, before launching a general assault on the Singapore fortress. 20,000 Australian troops have been encircled by Japanese forces in Segamat through a flanking maneuver, forcing British forces on both the east and west coasts of the Malay Peninsula to retreat. One Japanese unit this morning advanced into Yong Peng on the central highway in Johor, cutting off the Australian troops' retreat route. In the Gemas area, Japanese forces used heavy artillery to bombard and press on the British forces. The latest reports from the Japanese vanguard indicate that Japanese forces have reached a point 20 miles from the strait between Singapore Island and the Malay mainland. The main force of the Japanese army, advancing south along the west coast, has crossed the Muar River and is continuing to expand its bridgehead today. It is reported that the focus of the Malayan campaign has now shifted to Segamat, about 20 miles southeast of Gemas. Japanese forces advancing south along the east coast are also rapidly advancing, pressing on the British forces. The characteristic of today's fighting is that the Japanese landed south of the Muar River and launched another flanking attack, forcing the British forces to continue their retreat south towards Singapore. The first Japanese landing point is less than 100 miles from Singapore.

London, 20th (Reuters) - Responsible sources here stated today that the main battle line in Malaya is at Segamat (located on the main north-south railway line, 95 miles from Singapore), where fierce fighting is taking place. The British lines are held by Australian troops. Japanese forces on the west coast of the Malay Peninsula resumed their flanking attacks, which have repeatedly threatened the British left flank in recent weeks. The British were therefore forced to make a strategic withdrawal yesterday. According to unofficial reports received in London, the southernmost Japanese landing point on the west coast of Malaya is about 90 miles from Singapore Island. At the same time, it is reported that the Australian Minister for Air has telegraphed General Bennett, commander of the Australian forces in Malaya, saying, "I can assure you that the government is taking all steps to strengthen the air support for your brave troops."

Singapore, 20th (Reuters) - Today's Far East British military communique stated that Japanese forces are still continuing to exert heavy pressure on the entire western front in Malaya, with their main force advancing in the Muar, Batu Pahat and Parit Sulong areas on the coast. Japanese patrols are active in Endau on the east coast of the Malay Peninsula. Yesterday afternoon, British fighters engaged in offensive flying in the Muar area, strafing and destroying several flat-bottomed boats and engaging with a large force of Japanese aircraft.

London, 20th (Reuters) - Reports of Japanese forces landing closer to Singapore have not been confirmed here today. It is reported that there has been no change in the situation in the Endau area (east coast of Malaya) and the Gemas area.

Two Waves of Japanese Bombers Attacked Singapore Yesterday Morning

Today's local communique reported that military installations were slightly damaged during the air raids and that British fighters had intercepted them.

Tokyo, 20th (Domei News Agency) - The Imperial Headquarters announced at 3:30 PM today that Japanese fighters, escorting naval bombers, carried out the 18th bombing raid on Singapore on the 18th of this month. On the return flight, they were intercepted by 20 enemy aircraft over Johor and engaged in a dogfight, shooting down 15 of them. Two Japanese fighters are missing.

The British and American governments are well aware of the importance of defending Singapore, but only a quick and full reinforcement of General Wavell's forces will suffice. The Yorkshire Post commented on the Japanese occupation of Tavoy in southern Burma, stating that the Japanese have two objectives from Thailand: Singapore and Burma. If the Burma Road is cut off, the entire strategic situation of the Allied forces in the Far East must be revised.

### Extremely Tense Defense Training in the Netherlands East Indies

Saigon, 20th (Haito News Agency) - According to information obtained here from the capital of the Netherlands East Indies, the war is increasingly approaching the capital of the Dutch East Indies, so the training ground for the Batavia National Defense Corps is extremely busy. In the morning or afternoon, the training ground is filled with men returning from their offices. Squads shouldering rifles can be seen all day long.

Mobile kitchen vehicles regularly drive to the training ground to provide coffee and cold drinks, as such drinks are essential due to the hot weather in the Netherlands East Indies.

### British Prime Minister Meets with Cabinet Members, Listens to Reports on the Situation in the Far East, Prepares to Answer Questions in the House of Commons, Rumors that the Opposition Party Insists on a Cabinet Reshuffle

Stockholm, 20th (Haito News Agency) - A Swedish reporter in London reports that Churchill has been meeting with cabinet members for several days, listening to detailed reports on the situation in East Asia and their opinions, in order to answer questions in the House of Commons. A major debate on the situation in Malaya is expected to begin in the House next week. The opposition party is scheduled to convene a meeting on Monday to decide on the attitude and policy to be adopted. Disregarding official and semi-official pressure, they still insist that the cabinet should be reshuffled, such as dismissing a large number of cabinet members, expanding the organization of the cabinet, and establishing a Ministry of Production. These demands are based on the opinions of the representatives of the British and Soviet trade unions. At a recent trade union conference held at Albert Hall in London, the Soviet representative stated that British workers work far less intensely than Soviet workers. The opposition party is expected to use these remarks as a basis for a major debate in the House of Commons. At the same time, "The Economist" opposes a sudden change in the organization of the British munitions industry, as this move is unlikely to produce beneficial results, but the newspaper believes that Churchill will make considerable concessions on this point. Regarding the issue of establishing an Imperial Cabinet, the semi-official Times believes that this move is unlikely to materialize, but Churchill will also make considerable concessions on this. According to sources close to the Prime Minister's Office, Churchill is unlikely to follow the Soviet example and exile several cabinet members to Siberia. All these issues must be decided after Churchill has heard the report on the situation in Malaya. The emotions of Londoners are becoming increasingly tense due to the growing crisis in Singapore.

Saigon, 20th (Haito News Agency) - According to news received here from Sydney, the Sydney Telegraph commented on the statement issued by Churchill upon his return to London, saying, "Churchill discovered that the British, like us, are worried about the war in the Pacific and indignant at those who promise much and do little. Churchill's first task is to dismiss those who see the war in the Pacific as a local matter in the greater war. A cabinet reshuffle would give us more faith than a dozen fine speeches."

London, 20th (Reuters) - An editorial in the London Times on Tuesday stated that Prime Minister Churchill has returned to London after successfully completing his mission. From now on, he must implement all necessary measures to further improve the armed alliance, and the strategy of the Allied nations will also have broad and up-to-date plans. The newspaper pointed out that there is an obvious weakness in the British war machine, namely that issues and strategies involving two or three ministries are often delayed or shelved due to the lack of firm instructions from above. Strategically speaking, this weakness has been recognized, as the army, navy, and air force were not previously subordinate to the War Cabinet, but are now directly commanded by Prime Minister Churchill in his capacity as Minister of Defense. If Prime Minister Churchill reshuffles his cabinet, he should form a strong and powerful policy that is trusted by the people.

London, 20th (Havas) - Prime Minister Churchill, after returning from the United States, attended the House of Commons today and made a speech stating that a discussion on the war will be held within a short period of time, lasting three days. If this discussion involves questions to the government, a vote of confidence will be requested. Liberal Party MP Granville proposed a motion to immediately discuss the situation in the Far East, especially the issue of sending sufficient aircraft to defend Singapore, but the Speaker immediately rejected it.

Stockholm, 20th (Haito News Agency) - The British military defeats in East Asia have caused the discontent within the country to rise. It is said that British Prime Minister Churchill is finding this situation difficult to handle. As for whether Churchill will reshuffle the cabinet, it is said that no decision has yet been made.

### British Issue Statement on Detaining Western Cargo Ships

Ambassador Kerr's Departure from China is Regretted

Predicting Possible Outlets for China and the World, All Countries Should Embrace United Goals for the War

All newspapers detail the situation in the Pacific and predict possible outlets for China and the world. The "Ta Kung Pao" states that British and American reinforcements have not yet arrived in the Pacific, so British naval experts have lost the opportunity for the second time due to secondary matters. The "Central Daily News" states that countries embrace united goals for the war, so individual sacrifices will no longer occur. The "Saodang Pao," the newspaper of the Chinese army, condemns Britain's lack of foresight and determination in Malaya.

Furthermore, according to reliable sources received in London, the battle for Kakovka, a city in the Soviet southern route Ukrainian industrial zone, has reached a decisive stage, with General Timoshenko's forces launching fierce offensives on the north and south sides of the city.

In other areas of the Eastern Front and in the Donets region, Soviet forces continued to attack, but were heavily damaged and retreated. The German army and air force defended effectively, causing the Soviet army to suffer more losses than gains.

Berlin, 20th (Haitong News Agency) – On the northern sector of the Eastern Front, Soviet forces attacked with tank units but were repelled by German infantry. Three Soviet tanks were destroyed by German anti-tank guns, and another was blown up by landmines. Over a hundred soldiers were killed. Near Leningrad, German artillery continued to bombard military targets in Leningrad, all hitting their marks. On the northern shore of Lake Onega, Finnish forces conducted mopping-up operations between January 1st and 11th, killing 1,443 enemy soldiers and capturing 167.

### A Glimpse of Commentary on the New Tripartite Agreement

Tokyo, 20th (Domei) – The new Japanese-German-Italian military agreement was commented on by various newspapers this morning. The Nichi Nichi Shimbun stated that this agreement marks a new era in the fight to overthrow Britain and the United States and to build a new world order. Once this military agreement is implemented, it will inevitably lead to the downfall of the two great powers. At a time when Germany and Italy are entering the next stage of the European war and Japan is militarily joining hands with them, Britain and the United States have effectively been cut off on both the eastern and western fronts, making it impossible to turn the tide of the war. The Hochi Shimbun stated that once this military agreement is implemented, the sharp blades of the three countries will surely pierce the hearts of Britain and the United States. The Chugai Shogyo Shimpo stated that this military agreement has completed the agreement not to conclude a separate peace that Japan, Germany, and Italy signed on December 11th of last year.

London, 19th (Reuters) – Berlin sources say that the German News Agency issued a brief semi-official statement stating that the German-Italian-Japanese military agreement has agreed on the appropriate allocation of the three countries' military forces, in order to conduct warfare with significant effect and immense striking power.

### First French Ship Arrives in Shanghai from Vietnam After the Outbreak of the Pacific War

Many depositors have already withdrawn the new limit of 2,000 yuan since December 10th, so they are waiting for the Japanese liquidation personnel to approve secondary withdrawals. Yesterday, sources from Allied banks revealed that Allied nationals from countries such as Britain, America, and the Netherlands, in addition to the monthly limit of 2,000 yuan for secondary withdrawals, will not be able to withdraw any remaining deposits for the time being.

### Shen Bao Readers' Scholarship Fund: Hoping for Continued Support from All Sectors

Many Applicants Have Not Completed Procedures; Must Carefully Fill Out Forms According to Regulations

Eight Extremes Wireless School Donates Free Spots

As the second Shen Bao Readers' Scholarship Fund begins operations, we firmly believe that we will receive assistance from all parties, especially from those in various sectors who provided support and sponsorship last year, and that they will continue to provide guidance to us to complete this work that is more urgent, more needed, and more difficult than the last one. Given the weak economic capacity of the general public, we are even more determined to do our best. Every bit helps, and helping one more person is one more person helped. Therefore, on the one hand, we hope that all sectors will recognize the times and enthusiastically donate. On the other hand, we hope that applicants will take matters seriously and not disappoint our efforts to ensure that their academic achievements are better than mine and their family finances are more secure.

Pay Attention to Application Procedures

Recently, many students applying for scholarships have enclosed requests for money or detailed descriptions of their family history. Many have not completed the application procedures published in this newspaper. Some have even written in a sloppy manner or failed to provide supporting documents. This situation is inappropriate. Students must be sincere and honest in all matters, even if they are currently struggling financially. Here are some points to note, and we hope everyone will pay attention: Regardless of the applicant group, the school for the next semester must be confirmed. If the application is approved and a check with the school's name is issued, it will be difficult to accommodate requests for changes. When applying, you must have proof of enrollment, such as a registration form. In these difficult times, donations from all sectors should be allocated carefully. Furthermore, tuition fees have increased significantly this year, so the review process will be strict. We hope that students whose families can barely make ends meet will not apply, and their grades must meet the standards. Applicants for supplementary schools must have a transcript from the previous semester if they previously requested a scholarship from this newspaper, or they must have a semester transcript if they are already studying in a supplementary school. However, this does not apply to those applying for free spots donated by various schools. Anyone interested in further education can apply, but they must also fill out an application form and provide proof from a business or company. We are currently reviewing and auditing the applications received from students. Those with complete procedures and qualified grades will be publicly announced in due course, and will not be notified separately. Those with incomplete procedures or unqualified grades will not be replied to.

### Ningbo Wealthy Woman Receives Anonymous Letter Demanding Over 200,000 Yuan

Two Criminals Arrested, Mastermind Still at Large

Yu Shen Qifang, a 34-year-old Ningbo woman residing at 775 Lane 6, Joffre Avenue in the French Concession, whose husband works as a broker at the stock exchange in the British Concession and is quite wealthy, was kidnapped in the autumn of last year. After she was ransomed, she received anonymous threatening letters from criminals in October and December, demanding over 200,000 yuan and arranging for the money to be handed over at a certain location. After receiving the letters, Mrs. Shen was frightened and reported to the French Concession police. Detectives disguised as the victim went to the arranged location to negotiate and arrested two criminals on the spot: Zhang Ziliang and He Chuanshan, both from Guangdong. They were taken to the police station and confessed to being instructed by a certain person who is still at large. The police chief ordered them to be detained pending the arrest of their accomplices for further investigation.

### Niece and Lover Conspire, Suzhou Old Woman Robbed

Liang Wang, a 56-year-old woman from Suzhou residing at a certain address in Cite Foch, Route Ghisi in the French Concession, was told by her niece, Shen Genbao, 22 years old, last month that cheap rice was being sold at a grain store in Nanshi. Wang trusted her and carried over 500 yuan in cash with her to go there together. On the way, three robbers suddenly came forward and robbed Wang of all the money she was carrying, as well as a jade bracelet worth over 1,000 yuan. Then, Shen and her lover disappeared. Wang reported to the police, and the truth was not discovered until the other day: Shen had colluded with her lover to rob and sell the bracelet at Zhenchang Jewelry Store on Avenue Edward VII for 320 yuan.

### Over 600,000 Residents Have Returned to Their Hometowns This Month

3,000 People Applied Yesterday Alone

Since the outbreak of the Great East Asia War on December 8th of last year, the number of local residents applying for necessary documents to return to their hometowns has been increasing daily. Outside the office in the Shanghai Municipal Council building where these documents are issued, the number of people waiting to apply has been increasing endlessly. Especially on the 19th and 20th, the number of people was so large that the Municipal Council formally requested the city government to help maintain order. As for the total number of citizens who have applied to the council, there are no official figures, but it is estimated that about 3,000 people applied at the council building yesterday morning alone, which is only slightly less than the number of people who applied the day before. Regarding this point, from the beginning of this month to the middle of the month, the total number of Chinese who returned to their hometowns reached 600,000, leading to a sudden surge in inland river traffic. Every day, many Chinese carrying heavy burdens and packages wait on the Huangpu River to board ships for departure.

### Dismissed Teacher Holds a Grudge, Stabs School Director; Wu Yaqin's Fingers and Face Injured, Perpetrator Sentenced to 30 Days of Detention

The Ningbo Fellow-Villagers Association, for the purpose of providing assistance to its disadvantaged fellow-villagers children who were out of school, established six voluntary elementary schools. Recently, in order to cut expenses, the association, through the standing director Wu Yaqin, ordered the dismissal of five teachers. Yu Xiaolan, a Ningbo native residing at 284 West Soochow Road, 41 years old, was one of the five teachers dismissed. After learning of the suspension, he went to the association at 9:10 AM the day before yesterday, carrying a

fruit knife,

to negotiate with Wu Yaqin. Unable to reach an agreement, he suddenly took out the knife and stabbed him. Wu resisted with his hand, causing injuries to his fingers and face. He then shouted for help, and a tea server, He Yimei, heard the alarm, entered the room, and helped to disarm him. He reported to the Lao Zha police station, which dispatched detective Ding Yizhong to take Yu Xiaolan, along with the weapon, to the police station for detention. Wu was sent to Renji Hospital, where his injuries were certified. Yesterday morning, he was transferred to the Fifth Criminal Court of the Special District Court. Police lawyer Fang Fushu filed a lawsuit according to law. Wu Yaqin then testified that the defendant had served as a teacher at the Third School attached to the Ningbo Fellow-Villagers Association in 1926, and was later granted leave for illness. In 1936, he came to Shanghai and continued to work at the Third School. Not long after, due to his poor character, and according to the principal's report, the defendant was transferred to the Second School. Unexpectedly, the school board raised objections again, and he was once dismissed, but he was able to return to his post after

writing a letter of repentance.

Recently, the association wanted to save expenses, so I dismissed five teachers, and the defendant was one of them. The day before yesterday morning, the defendant suddenly came to my place and questioned the reason for the suspension. I replied that you did not arrive at school on time and did not correct homework. Unexpectedly, upon hearing this, the defendant claimed that he had suffered years of oppression and stabbed me with a knife. A highly educated intellectual who has served as a teacher for many years should have such behavior. I request that the court render a judgment in accordance with the law. The defendant's testimony was evasive, and he hired lawyer Qian Xingzhong to defend him in court. Judge Chuan Lan ruled that Yu Xiaolan should be detained for 30 days for the injury. If he chooses to pay a fine, it will be one yuan per day. The knife was confiscated.

### Closed Rice Stores Submit Written Petition

It is now known that temporary representatives Zhuang Jiemin and Ye Shuxiong, among others, were publicly elected by the rice market and, accompanied by Shi Hongxun and Qu Zhenhua, standing committee members of the Rice Store Association, went to the Shanghai Municipal Council to meet with the authorities to request an improvement in the situation. After listening to the representatives' opinions, the authorities expressed their sympathy but said that a formal petition was required to provide a basis for action. It is reported that the closed rice stores have drafted a joint petition and letter of official communication on the 19th and submitted them separately to the relevant authorities.

### Gold Price Plummets: So-Called Speculative Anxiety

Yesterday, the cash market for gold bullion experienced a sudden and sharp decline. The price had already fallen close to the 10,000 yuan mark. This was due to news of the Japanese authorities handling confiscated materials from warehouses, leading to various unfavorable speculations. Cotton yarn futures, etc., experienced an unprecedented plunge. All parties involved were weary and despondent, unable to rally. This prompted holders of physical gold to sell. From the morning, each tael (ten liang) initially opened with a decrease of 300 yuan. A certain gold shop first sold ten taels to Xinyuan, with a price of 11,500 yuan. Later, ten taels were also transacted at 11,550 yuan. However, the gold shops, Tianjin banks, silver shops, and Gonghe, etc., competed to sell aggressively, causing the price to drop sharply by 850 yuan, falling to 10,700 yuan. This was absorbed by the silver shops, Chengji, and Tongkangyong. The price then rose by 500 yuan, reaching 11,200 yuan. But then the money shops came in with a fierce sell-off, and the decline resumed. A certain gold shop, along with Xiangxingyong and Yinfu, frantically sold off, causing the price to plummet another 1,000 yuan. A certain gold shop's selling sentiment reached a low price of 10,200 yuan. Soon after, Taikang Runde Cheng bought in, raising the price to 10,500 yuan. Suddenly, the money shops sold again down to 10,200 yuan. At noon, it was 10,350 yuan, a sharp drop of 1,450 yuan compared to the previous day. There was a difference of 1,350 yuan that day, with a total transaction volume of over 3,000 taels. Silver jewelry shops, such as Daxin Tonghang, all lowered their prices three times, a total reduction of 150 yuan, to 1,100 yuan (buying price reduced by 200 yuan). Standard silver remained at 16 yuan, and the black market at 11.5 yuan.

Yesterday, the foreign currency market also experienced a severe decline. The British gold pound and the American gold pound each fell by 35 yuan, the former to 270 yuan, and the latter to 245 yuan. American dollar bills also fell slightly to 15 yuan and 23 cents. Hong Kong dollars were 2 yuan and 65 cents. Military notes remained at 3 yuan and 94 cents.

Yesterday, the discount rate for checks remained unchanged. The interest rate for interbank lending at the Money Trade Association remained at 6%.

### Government Bond Decline Stabilizes Slightly; Foreign Stocks Remain Listless

The over-the-counter market for government bonds initially weakened but then strengthened, showing slight stability and rising slightly compared to before. However, confidence has not yet been restored. At the same time, there were rumors, making those who bet on a rise slightly cautious. Class C bonds initially opened at 64 yuan and 50 cents, once reaching a low price of 64 yuan and 43 cents. Subsequently, due to demand from Qianyi, Tongxing, Dingkang, and Rui Da, etc., the price was quickly pushed up, breaking through 65 yuan, and reaching a high price of 65 yuan and 58 cents. However, with Tongkang, Lianyi, Shunting, and Dazhong, etc., offering a large supply, the price returned slightly to 65 yuan and 51 cents at the close. The fluctuations were very rapid. Class A initially traded at 69 yuan and 60 cents, rising to 70 yuan and 4 cents, then returning to 70 yuan and 2 cents. Class B bonds traded from 65 yuan and 8 cents to 66 yuan and 2 cents. Class D bonds traded at 62 yuan and 3 cents. Class E initially traded at 62 yuan and 6 cents, falling slightly to 62 yuan and 4 cents, and rising to 63 yuan and 3 cents, closing at 63 yuan and 2 cents. As a result, except for Class B, which was slightly lower by one cent, the rest all recovered by three to five cents. The total transaction volume was approximately 600,000 yuan.

Yesterday, the over-the-counter market for foreign stocks at the Stock Exchange was still in a downtrend. Although there was no shortage of buyers taking advantage of the low prices, it was difficult to reverse the already weak trend. Jardine Matheson Textile Mill traded a small amount at 20 yuan, then offered for sale at 20 yuan and 7.5 cents, but buyers only offered 18 yuan. Tramway prices ranged between 29 yuan and 30 yuan and 7.5 cents. Sino-British Cotton Mill ranged between 4 yuan and 8 cents and 5 yuan and 4 cents. Paper Mill buyers only offered 4 yuan, while sellers offered 4 yuan and 7 cents. The rest were all prices for buying and selling paper orders. Jiyeguang was 12 yuan and 3 cents, Zilaihuo was 6 yuan and 4 cents, Zhongfang was 8 yuan, Asia Navigation was 6 yuan and 8 cents, Di Pi was 11 yuan. All of the above had buyers. Wheelock Marden was 56 yuan and 50 cents, Shanghai Wool was 5 yuan, Yangzi was 10 yuan, Telephone was 32 yuan, Jardine Brewery was 5 yuan, Ken Zhi was 18 yuan and 50 cents, Steel was 18 yuan, Xiang Qin Timber was 27 yuan and 50 cents, Jia Lundan was 1 yuan. All of the above had supply but no demand. The rest had no price.

### Shuang Ma Factory Cotton Yarn Tickets Plummet by 420 Yuan

The cotton yarn market was extremely weak, and the downtrend was rampant. This was because, after the announcement of the Japanese authorities' handling of confiscated materials, a selling frenzy arose in the market. At the same time, the price of gold retreated, falling sharply. Shuang Ma factory cotton yarn tickets plummeted. The shouting of sales orders on the floor was loud, but only sellers were seen, not buyers. The situation was very weak. The opening price of 20-count Shuang Ma factory cotton yarn tickets was weak at 1,820 yuan. Then, with sellers crowding in, the market gradually declined, plummeting to a closing price of 1,420 yuan, a disastrous drop of 420 yuan compared to the previous day. The price of 42-count Blue Phoenix yarn was 3,880 yuan. The initial price of 20-count Yueqin was 2,160 yuan, falling to 2,080 yuan. The price of 20-count Shuang Ma spot goods was 2,000 yuan, falling to 1,980 yuan. The above were all down 170 yuan to 110 yuan compared to the previous day.

The spot market for raw cotton was originally active, but due to the disastrous fall in the yarn market, it also came to a standstill.

### Spot Cotton Cloth Remains Firm, Factory Tickets Plunge

Yesterday, due to the Japanese authorities' announcement of the method for handling confiscated inventory, the cotton cloth market also turned stagnant. Sales openings were extremely scarce. However, the spot price on the street still had buyers, so the market did not loosen. 16-pound Huadie coarse cloth still sold for 116 yuan, 12-pound Dapeng fine cloth for 95 yuan, and 8-pound Zhenzhong coarse cloth for 54 yuan and 50 cents. There were a few transactions.

Yesterday, the spot market for East cloth was affected by the temporary inability to deliver factory warehouse tickets, causing uncertainty and a weak market. 12-pound Longtou fine cloth factory tickets plummeted to 83 yuan, while the spot Longtou remained firm, still selling for 86-87 yuan. The morning opening price of colored cloth Sijunzi serge factory tickets was 3 yuan per yard, but then sellers flooded in, plummeting to 2 yuan and 80 cents to 85 cents. However, the spot market remained firm, still requiring 3 yuan and 5 cents. In the afternoon, the market announced the suspension of trading. From tomorrow onwards, only half-day trading will be conducted.

### Grain Market Conditions Exceptionally Bleak

After the previous sharp decline in domestic rice, yesterday there was a sudden price increase. This was because the selling price still required around 190 yuan per stone. After this decline, everyone felt that the profit was too thin and mostly took a wait-and-see attitude. Therefore, the supply of goods for inspection in the market was reduced. At the same time, stores, feeling that foreign rice was difficult to purchase, turned to domestic rice. Retail sales suddenly became strong, and there was a desire to replenish stock. However, due to the continuous decline in the market in the previous two days, they did not dare to act rashly and temporarily adopted a wait-and-see approach. Seeing that the rice price had already fallen through, they all seized the opportunity to purchase at a low price. For a time, the way forward was unusually lively, and the sellers took the opportunity to raise prices. Although the price of Bo Dao rice was still conservatively held at the original level in the morning, continuing to open at 195 yuan, it then gradually rose, from 196 yuan to 198-9 yuan. Early rice always uses the price of Bo Dao rice as a standard, and the trend was the same, also rising from 195 yuan to 197-8 yuan. In total, the price of early Bo Dao rice increased by three to four yuan compared to the previous market. Except for the ordinary market goods, which remained at 226-7 yuan due to the normal way forward, the high-quality Japonica rice, due to the scarcity of goods and fragrant flavor, increased by two to three yuan, with special Japonica rice opening at 231 yuan, 230 yuan, and high-quality ordinary Japonica rice at 229 yuan. The newly arrived Nangang flower glutinous rice opened at 198 yuan. Yin Yuan, Bian Yuan, Du Jian Yang Jian all had no transactions due to the lack of inventory.

The corn market initially strengthened and then weakened. Initially, it strengthened due to inquiries from local streets and foreign merchants, but then suddenly a batch of inventory was released from Hongkou, causing the price to decline. The result was similar to before. 100 bags of Huangdu corn opened at 58 yuan and 50 cents. 100 bags of Dutch yellow corn opened at 52 yuan and 10 cents. 200 bags of white corn opened at 51 yuan and 50 cents to 51 yuan and 20 cents. 800 bags of Saigon new corn, West Warehouse price was 59 yuan to 57 yuan, East Warehouse was 57 yuan and 50 cents to 57 yuan.

The supply and demand of red sorghum was still balanced, and the market was stable. Yesterday, two cars of Mingguang red sorghum were sold at 55 yuan to 54 yuan and 80 cents, with little change from before.

Yesterday, the Township Association helped Shen Ji sell 1,000 warehouse tickets for soybean cakes for May, at a price of 21 yuan and 80 cents.

Because most of the cooking oil has been purchased, the market inventory is increasingly scarce, and the price has continued to rise. Yesterday, 100 dan of Xiaoyou factory cooking oil were sold at 300 yuan, an increase of another 2 yuan compared to before.

The source of soybeans from the Longhai Railway area has been gradually arriving recently, but there is a lack of wholesale volume, and the warehouse inventory has not yet been unsealed, so the trend is still firm. Yesterday, the street sold 140 bags of Bengbu mixed old soybeans at 109 yuan, 50 bags of Qingkou old soybeans at 111 yuan, one car of Gaoyou Qing soybeans at 116 yuan, 30 bags of Pudong She soybeans at 120 yuan, 100 bags of Changzhou Niupi yellow soybeans at 110 yuan, 50 bags of Wuhu yellow soybeans at 110 yuan to 112 yuan. There was also Tianjin Xin Jinyuan shouting for sale at 125 yuan, but no transaction was made.

The red bean market suddenly turned weak yesterday, because actual sales were not smooth, and scattered hoarders sought to sell, so the market price was three to four yuan lower than before. It is estimated that 300 bags of Chongming sand red beans were traded at a price of 85 yuan.

Bran continues to have inquiries from local inland merchants and various households, with a total transaction volume of 1,300 to 1,400 bags throughout the day. The market sentiment continues to be strong. However, there has been a sell-off of customer bran at high prices, and there has also been an outflow of Sanxin bran spot goods, so the selling price has not been able to be excessively raised. Only the Lanzhua bran opened at 55 yuan, which is one yuan higher than the previous market. Sanxin bran opened at 55 yuan and 70 cents, and the seller shouted 56 yuan, but no agreement has been reached.

### Medicine Euryale Seeds Still Weak

Recently, the market for medicinal euryale seeds has been weak due to very narrow sales channels. Although the source is scarce, the market is still weak. The current market price is around 200 yuan, but there is still a lack of large-scale demand. Transactions have fallen by more than one-third compared to the high prices.

Spring and Autumn

### Visiting Ying茵 at Baolong Hospital: Weak Health Suddenly Spawns Suicide Attempt, Still in a Comatose State

— Tai Xu

Twenty-four hours before receiving the news of Ying茵's suicide, I had a short conversation with her in front of her residence on Route Lafayette. After she acted in "Peking Man," her health gradually weakened, and the doctor instructed her to rest. After the contract with "United" company expired, it was not continued. The focus of our conversation was asking her about her future interests.

"I think it's better to rest," she replied to my question, then showed me a prescription from the doctor. —The prescribed medication was to treat heart weakness.

"I also have problems with my bronchi," she added.

Ying茵's physique was originally very healthy. Perhaps being taken over by illness put her in a very depressed state, but judging from her demeanor twenty-four hours before, I never thought she would take her own life.

After receiving this unfortunate news, I made two phone calls and inquired about the hospital where Ying茵 was staying, which was Baolong Hospital, number 419. Baolong Hospital was undergoing renovations. After crossing the small path covered in cement and the wooden suspension bridge, I was sent to the fifth floor by the elevator.

Friends who came to visit Ying茵 were waiting in the reception room. From their conversation, I learned that it was a waiter at the International Hotel who discovered her suicide. Fortunately, it was discovered early, and there was still time to perform surgery. However, as of now, she is still in a comatose state. According to the doctor, her fate can only be determined after ten o'clock today (the 20th).

Ying茵 is a single woman in Shanghai, with no relatives. The person currently attending to her is Miss Li, who is her closest friend. Because I could not directly visit the ward, I obtained some information about Ying茵's recent situation from Miss Li's oral account — which may also be the reason for the suicide.

"Because her past health was too bad, she couldn't bear the torment of illness. When she acted in 'Peking Man,' she coughed up blood, and added with extreme heart weakness, she often expressed pessimism about her body. Recently, she may have been affected by something, so she launched this unwise means..."

As of press time, according to news from Baolong Hospital, the most dangerous period has not yet passed. I hope that by the time this newspaper reaches the readers, Miss Ying茵 will be safe and sound.

### After Wage Cuts

— Yu Yi

In the dark and crowded kitchen.

Ah Mao, who has just learned to walk, swayed his small body from the bedside to his father's feet, hugging his knees and patting his father's legs with his small hands; but his father ignored him, so he tried his best to shake him, causing his father's knees to swing from side to side.

Ah Mao's father was sitting on a bamboo chair. The four legs of that bamboo chair seemed unable to support Ah Mao's father's sturdy body, although there were several hemp ropes connecting the middle of the two rear legs. But when Ah Mao's father shook his body slightly, it would inevitably make a creaking sound.

Ah Mao's mother was using a basin filled with black scars to bring in a basin of cold water; she also took out six or seven sweet potatoes from the wallet under the small table and put them in the cold water.

"Mom—I want..." Ah Mao shook his small body and staggered towards Ah Mao's mother. Ah Mao's mother glared at him, and he didn't dare to call out anymore.

Ah Mao's father took out a coarse cigarette. He didn't speak, but often shot his gaze at Ah Mao's mother's face. Ah Mao's mother was looking down, but occasionally when she looked up, the four gazes would meet. However, at this time, it was often Ah Mao's father who weakly flicked his gaze down to avoid Ah Mao's mother's gaze, quietly smoking his cigarette.

A month ago, he was still living in a peaceful atmosphere. He had work, he could maintain the lives of his family of three; and regardless of the painful wounds contained in this life, however, now, even the life that had been spent so hard for several years was over, and would be lost.

He took a hard puff of his cigarette, he wanted to swallow all the smoke; but he didn't, the smoke could only drill into his brain from his mouth, swirl around in his brain, and then squeeze out of his nostrils.

Wages have been cut, three hours a day; from two to five in the afternoon, the factory does not provide lunch, and the wages are less.

He took another puff of his cigarette, he sucked it in hard, but it still swirled in his brain and squeezed out of his nostrils.

Sixteen: Flames of Youth

"No wonder you're spending so much money, silly child!" She paused slightly. "Okay, then let me see a photo of that girl first!"

"I don't have one!" Shao Hua spread out his hands and said very sincerely, "Whenever she sees me, she's always so proper that she doesn't even say a joke, so how could I dare to ask her for a photo?"

"Then you must know her name!" Xiang Qi forced a smile and said jokingly.

"They all call her Mei Bao."

"Ah! Mei Bao?" Xiang Qi looked at Shao Hua fixedly with her eyes wide open, as if she had suddenly been electrocuted, and the smile disappeared immediately.

"Yes, the Mei of plum blossom, the Bao of treasure." Shao Hua recited as if he found it very tasteful. "Moreover, Aunt, you don't need to see her photo to know how beautiful she is! But please don't be angry when I say it."

"Not angry, tell me, tell me!" Xiang Qi's breathing was almost stopped.

"She looks very much like you, just look at the few photos of you when you were young pasted in your photo album..." Just as Shao Hua was talking happily, he suddenly realized that his aunt's face had turned ashen, and she seemed about to faint. "Aunt! Aunt!" Shao Hua shouted anxiously.

"Shao Hua, is their surname really Han—?" Xiang Qi asked, struggling to muster her strength.

"That's what the old man told me himself, and the waiters in the restaurant also call him Old Man Han——." Hearing these two sentences, Xiang Qi's expression improved slightly.

"Aunt, your face looks terrible, like you're sick, would you like me to help you back to your room to rest?" Shao Hua asked with great apology.

"Shao Hua," Xiang Qi opened her eyes wide and said in a strangely unnatural voice, "I'm going with you tonight!" (310) (End of Section 16)
