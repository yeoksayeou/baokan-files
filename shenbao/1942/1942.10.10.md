Lisbon, 8th, Alliance News Agency

The battle for Stalingrad has been ongoing for 46 days. According to certain intelligence, the fighting is still taking place in the factory area northwest of the city. German and Soviet forces have mutually buried large tank vehicles as fortresses, engaging in artillery battles and close-quarters combat. A certain unit of the German army, located in the central area of these installations, after dozens of fierce battles with the Soviet army, reached the banks of the Volga River on the 7th, taking a threatening stance by encircling the northwestern Soviet forces from the right flank. Strong tank units have been urgently dispatched to provide support and it is claimed that they have repelled the German forces from the banks of the Volga River. Furthermore, the Soviet counter-offensive north of Stalingrad is also fierce, with no changes yet. According to Soviet news reports, the German army has mobilized Prussian shock troops to participate in the street fighting in Stalingrad since the 7th.

London, 8th, Havas News Agency

The German side has added two fresh divisions to assist in the battle in this area. It is said that the city is ablaze with light and flames are everywhere.

Berlin, 9th, Huitong News Agency

The German army in northern Stalingrad has now switched to using heavy weaponry and heavy artillery to bombard Soviet defense positions. In order to avoid unnecessary sacrifices, the German army first uses heavy artillery to destroy resistance nests, and then infantry and engineers rush in to occupy them. Although the progress is slow, the results are very effective. The main objective of the German offensive is the Volga River, which they reached several weeks ago. The initiative on all sectors of the Eastern Front is in the hands of the German army.

Somewhere on the Soviet border, 8th, Havas News Agency

Military observers here recently commented that the summer offensive launched by the German army on the Eastern Front is coming to an end, and it is expected that no surprising military events will occur. According to a statement by German spokesman Colonel Dittmar, the German High Command will concentrate its efforts in the coming weeks on improving existing positions, especially the complete capture of Stalingrad. Once this objective is achieved, the frontline fighting will stabilize. In the Caucasus, the German army is continuing to move in order to occupy a line and then consolidate its positions on this line to safely get through the winter and serve as a base for future offensives. Although fierce fighting is still taking place in the Terek River basin, the German operational objective is not to continue advancing but to break through the Red Army's defenses in order to occupy a more advantageous position. As for the fighting at the port of Tuapse on the Black Sea coast, it is facing considerable difficulties due to the weather. Heavy rain and dense fog in recent days have greatly slowed the German advance. As for the Stalingrad area, fierce fighting is now taking place in the city's northern industrial district. German planes have continuously bombed the area, with no less than a thousand aircraft. Agricultural machinery factories and tank factories have been destroyed, but the Red Army is still resisting in the heavy rain. It is expected that the German army will launch a decisive offensive against the Red Army's positions after a few days of preparation. Both sides are using aircraft to transport large numbers of fresh troops as reinforcements. In the northwest of Stalingrad, the flat ground has become a quagmire due to the heavy rain, but General Timoshenko's troops are continuing to attack the German positions between the Don and Volga rivers regardless of everything. According to Soviet news last night, the Red Army has been able to erect pontoon bridges between the Don River's Luriya and Traktisky.

Moscow, 8th, Havas News Agency

The Red Army General Headquarters has issued a war report stating that our army continued to fight in the Stalingrad and Mozdok areas today. There were no major changes in other war zones.

### Courageous, Vigorous, Hardworking, and Enduring

— Wang Zhaoming

In the year of Yiwei (1915), the Founding Father launched the first National Revolution in Guangzhou. At that time, Comrade Lu Haodong died in the line of duty. Since then, young people across the country have continuously contributed their blood to the National Revolution until the March 29th Uprising of Xinhai, when the seventy-two martyrs used the purest blood, the blood of the most knowledgeable and morally upright youth in the country, gathered together, to lay the foundation for the Republic of China. Thus, the Republic of China was established on August 19th of the same year.

Since the founding of the Republic of China, there have been many disasters and hardships. In recent years, the country has almost been on the verge of destruction. The establishment of the Republic of China relied on young people, and the regeneration of China will naturally rely on young people. Every young person always has a question in their conscience: Can China be saved? To be more specific, can the peace movement succeed? Can China be liberated in the Greater East Asia War? In fact, there is only one answer to these questions: it all depends on how young people themselves act. If young people across the country are demoralized and hesitant, then the answer is only pessimistic. If young people across the country have a great awakening and determination to take on the responsibility of revitalizing China and defending East Asia, then the answer is that nothing is impossible. The slogan given by the New Citizens' Movement to the youth groups and Boy Scouts across the country is: Courageous, vigorous, hardworking, and enduring. The current situation easily makes people feel secure and lose their will. On the contrary, we must have courage and vigor, firmly believe in the great goal of revitalizing China and defending East Asia, and strive unremittingly with a strong will until we succeed. The current situation easily makes people unable to bear the pain. On the contrary, we must be hardworking and enduring, firmly believe that these pains are necessary processes for revitalizing China and defending East Asia. We realize what Mencius meant when he said, "Born in sorrow, die in ease." We gather our spirits and experience the realities of "afflicting their minds, taxing their sinews and bones, starving their bodies, impoverishing their beings, confounding their actions; therefore, their minds are moved, their natures are hardened, and what they could not do is made possible." We use the suffering of the present to seek the happiness of the future, and we use the suffering of individuals to seek the happiness of the whole. Our country and nation will naturally have days of joy after suffering. We specifically highlight the eight characters of "courageous, vigorous, hardworking, and enduring" at this time to serve as the slogan of the New Citizens' Movement, which has profound meaning. All comrades of the New Citizens' Movement must understand this meaning and put these eight characters into practice. The National Day of the 32nd year will definitely be more optimistic and more progressive than this year.

The National Revolutionary Army Martyrs' Shrine and Memorial Tower, originally located near Linggu Temple in the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum, were renamed the National Revolutionary Martyrs' Shrine and Memorial Tower in accordance with a resolution by the Central Political Committee for the purpose of preserving the entire concept of the National Revolution. The renovation work was carried out by the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum Management Committee, which began the renovation in August of this year until recently. Chairman Wang was extremely concerned about the renovation project and personally visited the National Revolutionary Martyrs' Shrine and Memorial Tower at 3 PM on the afternoon of the 9th, accompanied by Chairman Min Yi of the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum Management Committee. Executive Committee Member Zu Yu and Vice Minister of Propaganda Guo Xiufeng, Zai Zhen, and other committee members were waiting in front of the Martyrs' Shrine. The Chairman first paid respects to the spirits of the National Revolutionary Martyrs at the Hall of Righteousness in the Martyrs' Shrine, and then inspected the Martyrs' Shrine and Memorial Tower. In accordance with the resolution of the Central Political Committee, all inscriptions and disrespectful texts from the Civil War era and the National Crisis era were removed. The center of the shrine was rebuilt as the spirits' altar of the National Revolutionary Martyrs. On both sides were inscribed the Founding Father's testament on the right and the national anthem on the left. Inside the Memorial Tower was inscribed the Founding Father's teachings. The shady trees and solemn, clean buildings fully express the noble and pure national spirit. After inspecting the Martyrs' Shrine and Memorial Tower, the Chairman also inspected the Hall of Light, newly built in Linggu Temple to commemorate Japanese comrades who aided the National Revolution. He gave detailed instructions on various renovation projects. The inspection lasted for one hour before he returned to his official residence along Zhongshan Road.

Tokyo, 9th, Central News Agency

At the symposium on Greater East Asia Construction and Youth Group Movement, Director Murakami of the Japanese Information Bureau first gave a speech titled "The Japanese Government's Policy on the Construction of Greater East Asia." The general idea was that the Greater East Asia War and construction are closely related. Without construction, victory would be meaningless. China and Japan should join hands and advance toward the great road of reviving East Asia. Finally, Mr. Lin Baisheng delivered a speech stating that the goal of the New Citizens' Movement is to revitalize China and defend East Asia. Therefore, the promotion of the New Citizens' Movement is for China, for Japan, and for East Asia. Therefore, we must first seek China's revival in order to fulfill the responsibility of building East Asia. He hoped that the leaders of the Japanese youth movement would assist.

### Military and Political Institutions to be Reorganized; Army, Navy, and Air Force Directly Under the Military Affairs Commission

Nanjing, 9th, Alliance News Agency

The National Government's institutions will be reorganized after the legislative procedures are completed, with the aim of concentrating and expanding military organs into the highest command. The Army and Navy Departments will be under the jurisdiction of the expanded Military Affairs Commission, so that the Army, Navy, and Air Force will be under the unified command of the Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission. This plan was approved by the Central Political Conference on August 13 and will be implemented after approval by the Legislative Yuan. According to this plan, the Army and Navy Departments will no longer be under the jurisdiction of the Executive Yuan, but will be under the Military Affairs Commission. The strategic, compilation, instruction, accounting, and intelligence departments that have been established or will be established that are related to the Army, Navy, and Air Force will also be handled by the Military Affairs Commission. The necessary personnel for this reform of military and political institutions have already been determined when the reorganization plan was approved by the Central Political Conference in August, as follows: Army Chief Bao Wenwei, Army Vice Chief Zheng Dazhang, Navy Chief Ren Shoudao, and Navy Vice Chief Zhao Guizhang. The National Government initially reduced the fourteen departments to the current ten departments in early August of last year, namely the Army, Navy, Interior, Foreign Affairs, Finance, Education, Justice, Industry, Transportation, and Propaganda Departments.

### Stanley Returns Home via Cairo to Seek Reconciliation of Disagreements Among Allied Nations; US Ambassador to Turkey to Return to His Post Soon

Moscow, 9th, Alliance News Agency

US Ambassador to the Soviet Union Rear Admiral Stanley flew back to his country via the capitals of Iran and Egypt yesterday to report to President Roosevelt on the situation in the Soviet Union and to reconcile the friction between the Soviet Union and the Allied nations.

Stockholm, Swedish Capital, 9th, Alliance News Agency

After Stanley had important talks with Stalin on the 6th, he made a statement to reporters before returning home on the 7th, saying that Soviet public opinion was dissatisfied with the US aid to the Soviet Union. Therefore, he plans to find a way to resolve this issue during his return to the country and will report to President Roosevelt on the Soviet Union's war effort and opinions. Stanley's statement is sufficient to show that there are great differences in opinion between the Soviet Union, Britain, and the United States regarding the war.

According to him, after the establishment of the Japanese-Soviet Neutrality Pact, Japanese-Soviet relations have not changed because the Soviet Union abides by the neutrality treaty.

US Undersecretary of State Welles delivered a speech at a dinner of the World Economic Association in Boston last night. He stated that he hoped the United States could exert its full strength to aid the Soviet Union in the shortest possible time and said that the United States would never negotiate peace before winning. In the future, the United States will supply the Soviet Union with as many munitions as possible and will open a second front to divert Germany's military strength. As for the work of resolving world economic difficulties after the war, although it is arduous, it is not without a solution. Finally, Mr. Welles mentioned that there are still two countries in the Americas that condone Axis agents engaging in activities against neighboring countries within their borders, which is regrettable.

### British Secretary of State for India States the Current Situation in India, Believing That Gandhi Should Be Fully Responsible for the Disputes; Indian Religious Groups Abroad Call for Mediation

London, 8th, Havas News Agency

When the House of Commons met today, the Secretary of State for India, Emery, answered various questions from members of parliament of various parties, saying that Mahatma Gandhi was fully responsible for the current situation in India and that there was no possibility of compromise between the British government and the Indian Congress Party. Since the outbreak of the riots in India, 846 people have died, 2,024 have been injured, 60 civil servants have died, 648 have been injured, and only a few British air force soldiers have died and been injured. The reason why the British military authorities used machine guns to shoot at the demonstrating crowds was that the intensity of the demonstration had constituted a human crisis, so they had to resort to this last resort. The Indian Governor has begun secret talks with the leaders of the orthodox Hindu Mahasabha Party. He also hopes that these talks will be expanded to other political leaders. Since our negotiations with the Congress Party broke down on August 8th of this year, the Governor has made many efforts, but so far he has not achieved any results. As for the question of Gandhi's responsibility for the failure of these negotiations, it has been discussed by various newspapers and public opinion. I do not think it is necessary to publish a white paper on this issue at this time.

Lisbon, 8th, Central News Agency

According to a dispatch from New Delhi, the Special Committee of the Hindu League, in view of the worsening situation in India, telegraphed Roosevelt and Chiang Kai-shek on the 8th, requesting that they mediate as soon as possible to break the deadlock in British-Indian relations. The general idea of the telegram was that rubber is necessary for the current situation in India, and in order to win over the hearts of the Indian people, it is necessary to recognize India's independence, entrust real power to the people, and establish an Indian government. The final responsibility for resolving the Indian problem depends on the attitude of the British authorities. If the Indian Governor refuses to meet with us and Gandhi, it will only make the situation worse. Therefore, repressive means alone cannot solve this problem. The Governor of Bengal also telegraphed the United States, requesting that it mediate British-Indian relations as soon as possible.

### After the Blackout, Be Ready at Any Time

Preparations Must Not Be Relaxed; Still Pay Attention to Signals and Shading Lights

After the Japanese Army and Navy Air Defense Headquarters announced that the period for the Yeci blackout training has ended, an important official from the Public Concession Police Department's Anti-Air Raid Section stated that blackout drills will be held from time to time in the future, and the next blackout period will be held in the near future. Therefore, residents should always be prepared to shade windows and turn off torches, as was the case from October 1. However, in the future, there will no longer be advance notice in newspapers, and the blackout drill will begin without warning.

Pay Attention to Signals

Residents should also be familiar with the different whistle signals. One blast every thirty seconds marks the beginning of the alert period. Several short blasts every five seconds serve as a prelude to the air raid alert period. A whistle sounding one blast every thirty seconds indicates the end of the alert. After the alert is issued, lights should be automatically and completely controlled until a whistle sounding once every twenty seconds indicates that the alert has been lifted. In addition, the French Concession recently held a fire drill during an air raid between Xujiahui Road, Terrace Road, Fulili Road, and Ladu Road. In the future, only those concerned will be informed of the drill in advance, one or four people.

The French Consul-General Expresses

The French Consul-General is deeply grateful to the residents within the Concession for their efforts to abide by the rules of the air defense drills. He specifically expressed his thanks for the efforts of all residents and the large expenses incurred due to the incident, which resulted in excellent results during the October 1st to 8th drills. In addition, the French Consul-General also thanked the Passive Defense Committee, the Baojia organization, the Fire Brigade, the Engineering Office, the Health Office, the Electric Power Office, the Tram Company, and the Police Department for their dedication to this particularly difficult task. In short, this time, we were able to overcome the difficulties thanks to the collective efforts of the people.

The Results of the Drill

Police Inspector Watanabe comprehensively detailed the results of the eight-day training. The results of the first three days were quite poor. Afterwards, thanks to the supervision of Director Ono and the efforts of the Baojia self-defense team members, the results showed excellence comparable to those obtained from several years of training. However, there are still many incomplete shading devices in the slums of the West Hongkou District. What is gratifying is that the number of various types of crimes committed during the blackout was less than half the time.

Those Who Violated the Regulations Were Punished

The Hongkou Police Department's jurisdiction arrested more than forty people who did not have complete blackout equipment at the imitation inspection on the 7th. The Xinza and Chengdu Police Department's jurisdiction adopted a policy of confiscating the citizen's certificates of those who violated the regulations. Six people were confiscated by the department. The results in the Jewish village under the jurisdiction of the Huishan Police Department were not very good. In the future, it is planned to exile and severely punish those who do not comply.

Locations Where Alerts Are Issued

In addition, according to the announcement of the Shanghai District Japanese Army and Navy Air Defense Headquarters, the locations where alerts are issued in the Public Concession south of the Suzhou River during the blackout period are the roof of the Yongfa Company on Nanjng Road, the supplementary house on Chengdu Road, and the Fire Brigade in Jing'an Temple. There are also several other alert locations set up in Hama North.

### Today's Double Tenth National Day Celebration

Today is the National Day celebration. All Japanese "zero-egg" police authorities are implementing temporary security measures. In addition to increasing the number of detectives at crucial road intersections, each joint defense area's self-defense corps is also increasing the number of guards on duty. At the border of the French Concession, next to the Hua community, all iron gates have increased the number of Chinese, French, and Vietnamese police, and also deployed female officers to inspect men and women entering and exiting. All roads connecting to Avenue Edward VII in the French Concession, such as Pa Li Chiao Road, Water and Electricity Street Tram, New Bridge Street, etc., will be equipped with steel wire nets to cut off traffic. At places such as Route Say Zoong (Avenue des Soeurs), Old North Gate, and Zheng Jia Mu Bridge, pedestrians entering and exiting will be inspected. Any gatherings not approved will be strictly prohibited, and the ban on setting off firecrackers will be extremely severe.

Broadcasts Announced, Ceremonies Held

Ling Xianwen, concurrent Director of the Qingxiang Branch of the Kuomintang's Party Affairs Office in this city, and Li Wen, and Gong Wenhuan, Deputy Directors, will broadcast to all citizens from the Shanghai Radio Station at 11:30 a.m. today (the 10th). In addition, the Shanghai Branch of the Qingxiang Committee and the Shanghai Special City Kuomintang Headquarters will issue a message to all citizens to celebrate the National Day. The City Government and the Security Command Headquarters of the Qingxiang Branch will also hold grand ceremonies.

Pan Da, Chief of the Shanghai Fourth Police Bureau, issued a text celebrating the Double Tenth National Day of the 31st Year of the Republic of China, briefly stating: Today is the Double Tenth Festival. In addition to celebrating, we should work towards two major goals. First, realize national peace. Working hard for peace to save China is Dr. Sun Yat-sen's national policy. China has been weak for a long time, so the urgent task today is to remove all obstacles and suffering by first achieving peace. I hope that the people and the government will work together to achieve this goal. Second, strive for our respective work. We must revive China, and it cannot be achieved through empty talk. We must be pragmatic. Every citizen has a responsibility, whether in agriculture, industry, commerce, or education, to improve our work and increase efficiency. Only in this way can we alleviate the country's difficulties and suffering and maintain national survival and independence.

The programs include Peking Opera on the 11th, Yue Opera and comedy on the 12th, and Shanghai Opera and storytelling on the 13th. However, the charity football match originally scheduled for the 11th has been postponed due to insufficient preparation.

Organization of the Youth Department

The Public Concession Baojia Administration has initiated the establishment of a Youth Department of the Baojia Self-Defense Corps. After several meetings by relevant parties and two months of research and progress, a general agreement has been reached in principle, and the organization work of the Youth Department Headquarters is being accelerated. It is expected that the establishment can be announced quickly after the completion of the Baojia Expanded Publicity Week. It is said that the Youth Department of the Self-Defense Corps is entirely composed of Self-Defense Corps members aged from 16 to 30. However, Baojia personnel and others with lofty aspirations can also request to join as members of the Youth Department. All work of the Youth Department is directly guided by the Shanghai Municipal Council Police Inspector General. The Police Inspector General also has the power to appoint and dismiss the cadres of the Youth Department Headquarters. The economic affairs of the Youth Department are the responsibility of the Baojia Guidance Department.

### Charity Bazaar and Dance Party

A charity bazaar and dance party will be held on October 24th and 25th in the ballroom on the ninth floor of the Cathay Hotel. The 25th is specifically for Chinese people, hence the name "China Night," and the 24th is for people from all walks of life, named "International Night." Due to the grand scale, the Cathay Hotel has agreed to remove a wall in the ballroom, which can accommodate at least 1,500 guests. It is heard that many tickets for tea dances and dinner dances have been sold. The women's group of the organizing committee convened a meeting, chaired by Mrs. Pan Da, to discuss everything to assist in the process. It was resolved that the women's group would be responsible for decorations, raffles, and collecting rare items for the bazaar, as well as inviting film stars and socialites to dance. Donations to the organizing committee office (Room 653, Hamilton House, telephone 13926) have been continuous, totaling nearly 60,000 yuan.

### Flour Purchase Certificates to Be Issued

According to a Datong News Agency reporter who inquired with the Shanghai Municipal Council's Grain Management Committee, flour purchase certificates will be distributed on the 22nd. Their form is similar to rice purchase certificates. The only difference is that the words "Buy Rice Certificate" are written on the right side of the certificate, while the words "Buy Flour Certificate" are written on the left. Residents can obtain flour purchase certificates using the same method as obtaining rice purchase certificates. If a resident moves from District A to District B, a written notification is required, and the Baojia chief of the resident's district will certify and stamp it, then the resident can apply to the rice purchase certificate issuing office to receive the certificate.

### Wing On Textile Shares

Soared by 270 yuan in one day, reaching a high price of 1,860 yuan.

Yesterday, the market conditions for Chinese stocks continued to improve. People from all walks of life were concerned, and the sentiment was mostly positive. The main reason was that Wing On Textile suddenly announced the return of the factory and other dual benefits, and investment news suddenly showed a state of demand exceeding supply. The price flew from 1,560 yuan to a high of 1,860 yuan, a huge increase of 270 yuan compared to the previous day. This stirred up the buying momentum of various stocks. Dasheng No. 1 and No. 3 factories also rose in the buying momentum. Small-denomination stocks such as Dachung and Hongsheng also rose to 12 yuan. The former closed at 11.5 yuan, up 2.5 jiao, and the latter closed at 11.75, up 2.5 jiao. Fuchang Dyeing and Weaving was slightly lower by 2.5 jiao, with the final price at 17.25.

Culture stocks closed down again by 1 yuan at 73 yuan, which is due to the recent dramatic rise being too high and a lack of buyers. Yongxiang Printing was still at 16 yuan, Commercial Press was around 310 yuan, and China Bookstore was at 115 yuan, each up 5 yuan. The new pharmaceutical industry, Xinya Pharmaceutical Factory, saw a small pullback of 5 jiao to 46.5 yuan due to the soaring price of 2 yuan the previous day and high selling activity.

### Government Bonds Broke Through the 60 Yuan Barrier

The over-the-counter market conditions for government bonds were once again prosperous, rising sharply and continuously. The prices of the five types of government bonds all broke through the 60 yuan mark, reaching new highs. All previous concepts of 20% off have disappeared. The so-called limit price of 45 yuan is now known to be a kind of smokescreen. The actual reason is mostly speculation by floating capital, and a small number of short positions. Now that it has been squeezed, it is feared that the momentum will be unstoppable. The harm of the flooding of floating capital is so great. Today, it is concentrated in government bonds, and the price of government bonds has skyrocketed. If it shifts to other areas in the future, it is feared that there will be similar dramatic consequences. At the beginning of trading, all bonds except Type A were within the 60 yuan range. In less than ten minutes, they all broke through the 60 yuan barrier. The buyers were buying in every way possible, and those covering short positions added to the momentum, which was like adding fuel to the fire and meeting a strong wind. The highest price for Type C was 64 yuan, and the last price was 63.6 yuan. Type A had a high price of 62.5 yuan. Type B also had a high price of 61.5 yuan. Type D also had a high price of 61.05 yuan. Type E also had a high price of 61.2 yuan, an increase of 2.4 yuan to 3.9 yuan. The transaction volume was approximately 3 million yuan. Today is the Double Tenth holiday, and there will be no trading today.

### Retail Sugar Sales are Restricted

Recently, retail sugar sales in various southern goods stores have been restricted, causing inconvenience to the general public. Many people consider sugar to be an essential food item for us, so they went to the Sugar Merchants Cooperative Business Office to inquire about the situation. According to Mr. Jin Yan Shen Xing, the sugar currently in stock is abundant and sufficient to be allocated to the general public for a long time, so there seems to be no need to panic. However, recently, a small number of Type B retailers have not restricted the quantity sold at the door. Therefore, the information heard is recorded and announced to the public.

### Piece Goods Exhibit Strong Upward Pressure

Factory Cloth

Yesterday's cloth market was unusually quiet in terms of actual sales, but industry insiders remained firm, as the cost of raw materials, although under heavy pressure, was still more likely to rise than fall. 16-pound Earth brand coarse cloth was 190 yuan, Flying Swan 181.5 yuan, 5-pound New Character 110.5 yuan, 8-pound Zhenzhong 107.5 yuan, 12-pound Earth brand fine cloth 160 yuan, Dapeng Single 160 yuan, Fugui 55 yuan, Bank Single 151 yuan, Fugui Fine Twill 141 yuan, Chick Linin 243 yuan, Qin Meiren Yuan Cloth 137 yuan, Three Sheep Serge 5.5 yuan. There were few changes.

The market was slightly up. 12-pound Longtou Fine Cloth Bank Single opened at 159.25 yuan, fell slightly to 158.75 yuan, and then rose again to 159.25 yuan. Demand exceeded supply, and the asking price was 159.5 yuan, an increase of 0.5 yuan. There was very little trading of Xinxin Single Longtou, and the asking price was still 168 yuan.

### Veteran Actor Bao Jixiang

— Tuo Gong

The apprentice takes the stage, and the teacher takes charge. In the past, Yu Shuyan had Li Shaochun in Peiping, and Wang Yaoqing had Wang Yulao in Shanghai. It is well known that Bao Jixiang, Yu Shuyan was the chief of the male roles, and Wang Yaoqing was the master of all female roles. This time, Bao Jixiang is supporting Li Zongyi, and many Shanghainese may find Bao Jixiang unfamiliar, so let me introduce him.

Bao Jixiang is a disciple of Wu Liankui (both he and Yu Shuyan were Wu's students). He is skilled in the second male lead role, and his performances are always in accordance with the rules. He never takes the stage with the kind of desperate energy that is common among second male leads in recent years, but when he performs vividly, he also earns the praise of the audience. Yang Xiaolou wanted him to play supporting roles, such as Jia Xu in "Fighting Wan Cheng" and Ru Biao in "Luoma Lake." Bai Dai has a record of this, and those who have heard and seen his performance know the results. Yu Shuyan wanted him to play even more supporting roles, such as Chen Ping in "Stealing Zongjuan," Gongsun Chujiu in "Searching for the Orphan," Liulang in "Visiting Mother," Yan Yan in "Dingjun Mountain," and Wang Ping in "Empty City Strategy." It seemed that only Bao could be worthy of the role. Mei Lanfang wanted him to play the role of Lan Pao in the record "Yutang Chun." Everyone has probably heard it, but who has paid attention to the ad-libbed lines in the singing? He is able to say them calmly in the short huqin interlude, which shows his skill.

He can be said to have a broad knowledge of old male roles, not to mention the old tunes. Therefore, after Meng Xiaodong became Yu's apprentice, she also became his student. He has taken in many apprentices in recent years, such as Yang Baosen, etc. Meng became his student because of his well mannered acting. But why aren't Yu's acting also well mannered? Let's discuss it in another article.

His real name is Fenglin. He is more than sixty years old, with a thin figure and gray hair. If you didn't know that he was a veteran actor, you would definitely say that he was a teacher. He is calm and never rushes when talking about opera. He is a patient and kind mentor. It can be said that Li Zongyi made the right choice by becoming his student. Li was a Tianjin amateur performer. A few years ago, I heard him perform in Tianjin when his voice was not good and he was learning Ma Lianliang's style. Now I hear that his voice is very strong and resonant. I hope he will study hard with this teacher and get rid of the Ma accent so that he can become a famous actor.

### Li Zongyi and Li Yuzhi Combined Review

— Plum Blossom Hall Owner

Before Li Zongyi and Li Yuzhi came to Shanghai, all those who cared about drama were worried about New Stage, thinking that at a time when various theaters were competing to invite famous actors, New Stage actually came up with two not-so-famous actors. Compared with each other, it was difficult to compare with other theaters in terms of seat sales. Who knew that the facts were not so bad? When the two Lis performed "Silang Visits His Mother" on the first night, one was full of energy and graceful, and the other was charming and colorful. From the start to the return, the two male and female characters matched each other particularly well. Not only were the long singing passages captivating, but even the most ordinary small movements actually won applause from the entire audience. Everyone said that the names of the two Lis were not well-known, but their performances were above par. Such word-of-mouth spread, and the sales for the second day and after were indeed extraordinarily popular.

Regarding the plays of the two Lis, I have seen more of Zongyi's performances, including "Empty City Strategy," "Wang Dingzhi Releases Cao," "Protecting the Country," "Two Entries to the Palace," "Sangyuan Hui," "Pearl Curtain Village," "Li Ling Stele," "Beating the Drum and Scolding Cao," "Heroes' Gathering," and "Clean Official Record." I have seen more of Yuzhi's performances. In addition to the duet plays performed by the male and female roles, I have also heard many of her solo masterpieces, such as "Female Escort," "Yutang Chun," "Spring and Autumn Match," "Satisfied Marriage," "Nengren Temple," "Yuelaidian," and "Mother and Daughter Meeting." Zongyi was born with a good voice, both bright and clear. Apart from Song Xian and Luo Kan, it is difficult to find a second one who can be compared to him in the old male role. After being instructed by the veteran actor Bao Jixiang, his attainments are naturally very methodical. His drumming in "Scolding Cao" is also quite pure and very fancy. It is rare for an amateur performer to have such achievements.

Yuzhi's acting is proficient in both the female lead and the female supporting roles. Her singing and acting are quite similar to those of Cheng Yanqiu. Her water sleeves are beautiful, and her skills are especially evident in the patterns. Her female lead roles, such as "Wujiapo," "Sangyuan Hui," "Mother and Daughter Meeting," "Protecting the Country," and "Two Entries to the Palace," do have considerable training. Her voice is high and low, and she is able to control her tune above 6.5. In "Entry to the Palace," she is even able to compete with Li Zongyi and Jin Shaochen, which is truly not easy. Her female supporting roles are even more exquisite and lively, with her eyes full of the play's emotions. Her demeanor in "Nengren Temple" completely imitates that of Xun Huisheng when she acted as a matchmaker for An and Zhang. Her expressions and voices can be said to be beautiful to the extreme, and it can also be said that she is as vivid as Cuihua and Xiaoliuxiu. When Li Duokui first came, her voice was slightly dry, but in the past few days, it has become very smooth. On the evening of the 7th, her performance of "Fishing for the Golden Turtle" was full of energy and ease, and she was truly able to give the audience a pleasant experience.

### Riding the Storm Together

— He Jia Zhi

(10) Flying Peak

Huang Long slapped his chest and said, "Why should we be afraid of them? Even if there are a hundred people outside the door, we'll just treat them like a hundred ghosts. Do people fear ghosts?" Cui Zhen, whose courage had been broken by fear, was invigorated by Huang Long's words. She put her feet on the ground and wanted to leave this place of work with Huang Long immediately. However, as soon as she stood up, her body swayed and she almost fell. Huang Long said, "I'm late. You must have suffered." As he spoke, he leaned toward Cui Zhen and squatted down halfway, patting her shoulders. Cui Zhen understood what he meant. At this moment, what was the point of avoiding suspicion? Without hesitation, she leaned on him and said in her mouth, "I can't afford you." Huang Long felt some weight on his body, and two slender hands came around his neck from left to right. Knowing that Cui Zhen was leaning on him, he stood up, turned his face to look at Wei Shaoyun, who was lying on the ground with his eyes closed, only exhaling and not inhaling. He then went to the door, muttering to himself, "Should I go back to where I came from?" He retreated two steps, turned his body to the left, pulled out a shiny, less than a foot-long dagger from his stocking, transferred it from his left hand to his right, aimed it at Wei Shaoyun's face, and stabbed.

Cui Zhen was not a ruthless killer after all. When she saw Huang Long's knife leave his hand, she couldn't help but cry out, "Ah!" But the knife, as if growing longer, stuck in the floor tile, only a fraction of an inch away from Wei Shaoyun's left ear. Due to the weight being heavier on top and lighter on the bottom, the blade swayed uncertainly in the lamplight. At this moment, someone outside the room suddenly spoke, "Young Master Wei, how are you now? Is everything different from before? Answer me one sentence so I can tell them. They said they would only start eating the spiced duck after receiving Young Master Wei's true news." Huang Long took a step forward and blew out the lamp with a "puff" sound. He muttered indistinctly, using the sounds in his mouth and nasal cavity to answer the question from outside the room. The person outside the room was easily dealt with. After Huang Long made that sound, he went out to report. Huang Long groped in the darkness and went to the back window, opened it, and the northwest wind came in with a wail. He and Cui Zhen went out against the wind. (199)
