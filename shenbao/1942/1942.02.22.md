### Sea Battle in the Lombok Strait; Japanese Troops Land on Bali; Java Threatened on Three Sides; Allied Forces Retreat from Sumatra

Tokyo, 21st (Domei News Agency) – The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 3:15 PM today that two Japanese destroyers engaged two Dutch East Indies cruisers and three destroyers in the Lombok Strait between Bali and Lombok Islands yesterday at midnight. They sank two destroyers and heavily damaged another. The Japanese destroyers pursued the Dutch cruisers for three hours. Subsequently, two more Japanese destroyers arrived to assist and attacked the enemy cruisers with torpedoes.

Batavia, 21st (Havas News Agency) – Official sources have announced that Japanese troops are continuing to land on Bali Island despite fierce resistance from the defending forces. Bali Island is separated from Java by only a narrow strait, about one mile wide. It has a population of 1.2 million, of whom only 400 are Caucasians.

Batavia, 20th (Havas News Agency) – Official sources announced that tensions have risen here since the Japanese invasion of Bali Island. The island is east of Java and is strategically important. If the Japanese occupy the island, Java will be threatened on three sides. In other words, the Japanese will be able to attack Java from Borneo in the north, Sumatra in the west, and Bali Island in the east.

Batavia, 21st (Reuters) – The battle for Bali Island continued last night and today, and it is undoubtedly a large-scale operation. The battle for Bali is the first round in the struggle for Surabaya and eastern Java. This is well understood here. The waters around Bali are turbulent with strong currents, large waves, and many coral reefs, and sharks are present. Only shallow-draft vessels can approach the shore, so the Japanese landing forces must transfer to smaller boats far from the coast. Because of the reefs, it is difficult for Allied submarines to operate there. Panarukan, on the eastern coast of Java, just one and a half miles from Bali Island, was bombed by Japanese planes today. However, there is no indication that Japanese troops will advance towards Batavia or western Java. According to today's Dutch East Indies Army communiqué, Japanese planes scouted northern Sumatra, and one airfield each in western and eastern Java were attacked and slightly damaged.

Batavia Harbor, 21st (Havas News Agency) – It has been learned that Allied forces have begun to retreat from Sumatra. Ten ships have arrived at Merak, Java, to evacuate troops.

Tokyo, 21st (Domei News Agency) – It is reported that Japanese troops landed yesterday at two locations on the Dutch-owned Bintan Island, 45 kilometers southeast of Shonan (Singapore), and occupied them without resistance. The island is known for its rich bauxite and tin deposits.

Tokyo, 21st (Domei News Agency) – The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced today: Japanese naval aircraft heavily bombed Surabaya on the 18th of this month, shooting down 13 American aircraft and severely damaging five destroyers. Two Japanese aircraft were lost. Japanese naval aircraft attacked Kupang, the capital of Dutch Timor Island, on the 17th of this month, destroying 20 buildings, including barracks and forts, and sinking a 3,000-ton merchant ship. Japanese naval units fought in the waters off Sumatra on the 17th and 18th of this month, sinking one enemy ship, capturing one British submarine destroyer, one minesweeper, and one British and one Dutch merchant ship. Japanese army aircraft bombed the Karijati airfield, 100 kilometers east of Batavia, yesterday, destroying or damaging a total of 27 enemy aircraft.

### Full-Scale War Breaks Out on the Bataan Peninsula in the Philippines; American Supply Lines Bombed

Washington, 20th (Havas News Agency) – According to an Army Department announcement, full-scale war has broken out on the Bataan Peninsula in the Philippines. Japanese artillery has heavily bombarded American supply lines.

Washington, 20th (Reuters) – The War Department announced yesterday that there are positional battles on all fronts of the Bataan Peninsula in the Philippines. Japanese planes dropped many incendiary bombs behind our lines. 60,000 workers at the U.S. Army arsenal sent a telegram to General MacArthur, commander of the U.S.-Philippine Allied Forces in the Philippines, expressing their respects. General MacArthur has replied with a telegram of thanks.

### Martial Law Declared in Darwin; Residents Ordered to Evacuate

Canberra, 21st (Havas News Agency) – Following repeated Japanese air raids on Darwin, official sources have declared martial law and ordered all non-essential residents to evacuate.

### Palembang Oil Wells Completely Destroyed; Large Stockpiles of Oil Consumed by Fire

San Francisco, 20th (Special Dispatch) – Mr. Pirie, an employee of the Standard Vacuum Oil Company in Palembang, Sumatra, broadcasted "Eyewitness Account of the Great Fire in Palembang" from Batavia to the United States yesterday, stating that the first Japanese paratroopers landed near the Standard Vacuum Oil Company refinery in Palembang at 9:30 AM on the 15th. The Standard Vacuum Oil Company began evacuating its employees at noon, while some experts prepared to completely destroy all machinery. At 2:00 AM the next morning, electricity was used to detonate five bombs simultaneously. With a deafening roar, millions of barrels of oil stored in the entire plant were consumed by fire. The 80-mile long pipelines and oil wells were then destroyed, with explosives placed every few hundred feet so that the entire 81-mile pipeline was destroyed simultaneously upon detonation. The methods used to prevent oil from flowing out of the oil wells during the destruction cannot be announced at this time. Some sources say that it will take several years of repairs before the Palembang oil wells can resume production, and several months of restoration will not be enough. A Batavia newspaper reported that the fire in Palembang was unprecedented in history. The fire was so intense that it caused a sudden change in the weather. The fire was followed by a major storm.

### The World Closely Watches the Political Developments in Britain; Cripps Broadcasts to the Nation Urging Increased Wartime Industrial Production

London, 20th (Havas News Agency) – The newly appointed Lord Privy Seal, Sir Stafford Cripps, delivered a radio address to the nation today, emphasizing the need to increase wartime production. He stated that at this point, all factories in the Soviet Union are completely on a war footing, without exception. "Every worker is prepared to die for their country and sacrifice for the success of their people." Although Britain has lost its naval superiority in the Southwest Pacific, he believes that ultimate victory will belong to us.

Berlin, 20th (Havas News Agency) – A semi-official German commentary on the British political situation stated that British Prime Minister Churchill would rather reorganize his cabinet than submit a vote of confidence to Parliament again. Furthermore, Churchill was willing to sacrifice his close confidant, Lord Beaverbrook, and recruit his "personal political enemy," Stafford Cripps, into the cabinet. He knows that Cripps is a close friend of Stalin and a person who carries out Communist orders within Britain. The reason he still believes that it is a good move to invite Cripps to serve as Leader of the House of Commons is because he believes that Cripps, after taking office, can respond to the attacks from the opposition in Parliament at any time. Churchill's intention is to turn the person who has criticized the government most fiercely in the past into the government's greatest supporter. Whether this strategy will succeed can be answered by past experience. In short, the cabinet reshuffle will not eliminate the difficulties Churchill is facing. At the same time, the public will still demand answers from the government regarding the recent political and military failures. In any case, Germany is closely watching how the British political situation will develop in the future.

### Fierce Fighting in Northern and Eastern Henan

Chongqing, 21st – Chongqing newspapers expressed their satisfaction with the British cabinet reshuffle. The Ta Kung Pao commented that Britain's greatest crisis was at the time of France's defeat. The current situation is far from what it used to be. Britain overcame the crisis at that time with a spirit of struggle and perseverance and eliminated the doubts about the capacity of the democratic system. With the institution being strengthened by this cabinet reshuffle, the domestic reforms and the foreign struggles will begin with renewed momentum. Because Churchill is decisive and intelligent, he accepted public opinion and removed those less capable members from the cabinet, and he brought in those who are more popular and capable. This is no different from injecting new blood into the wartime government. Politics will progress, and combat power will be strengthened. The war situation will change. The entry of the Labor Party's radical Stafford Cripps into the cabinet will make Britain and India more cooperative because Cripps has always advocated that Britain's friends in the Middle East are the people of India. In short, the anti-aggression front will be strengthened by the continuous struggle resulting from the British cabinet reshuffle. The Central Daily News said that this British cabinet reshuffle can only be regarded as the beginning of designing new policies and reviewing new strategies. The entry of Cripps can strengthen British cooperation with China, the Soviet Union, and India because Cripps is a strong advocate for Britain to have concrete connections with the three major nations of China, the Soviet Union, and India. Churchill accepted Cripps’s political views when he brought him into the cabinet. From now on, British foreign policy will have new developments, and there will be new decisions on the attitude toward India. Not only will this make the British Empire a unified and strong combat group, but the allies will also benefit from it. It goes without saying that the morale of the British people will be boosted because of this. The Saodang Pao commented that in this British cabinet reshuffle, Prime Minister Churchill concurrently serving as Minister of Defense can be regarded as the coordination of British political and military strategy, which means strengthening the British fighting spirit and implementing an active offensive. The assumption of new positions by Attlee and Cripps will help Churchill get along with India and complete the mission of mobilizing India. The disharmonious atmosphere in the government will also be eliminated by Cripps serving as Leader of the House of Commons, and so on.

Chongqing, 21st – There have been fierce battles in the areas of Shiban Gou (south of Jiyuan) and near Gaocun Station in northern Henan, and in the areas of Liukou and near Zhuji Station (both east of Yucheng) in eastern Henan for days.

### Former French Prime Minister Demands Investigation into Responsibility for Defeat; Military Leaders Should Be Responsible for Strategic and Tactical Errors

Lyon, France, 20th (Havas News Agency) – The Supreme Court in Lyon held its second hearing today on the case of those accused of leading the country astray. The attorney for former Prime Minister Daladier, Mr. Lebet, spoke, requesting the Supreme Court to investigate all responsibilities before 1936 and after France's entry into the war on September 4, 1939. He emphasized that it is necessary to conduct a military investigation into France's defeat, stating that "Our country's defeat was due to strategic and tactical errors. The demoralized spirit of our country's military leaders was also one of the reasons for the defeat because France had a strong army and unparalleled perfect equipment, as admitted by General Weygand, the former commander-in-chief of the National Defense Army. The Supreme Court should conduct another investigation to determine the responsibilities of those in command of the military. The real purpose of this trial was to try those who should be held responsible for the current European War and France's defeat, but at this point, it has changed its original intention and instead is trying those responsible for France's failure to prepare for war. Daladier's crimes are considered that he should be responsible for the current war and that he must answer for the French army's failure to be fully prepared, which is logically inconsistent." At this point, the president of the Supreme Court, Mr. Jaouss, warned Attorney Lebet that he should defend the court and not appeal to sentiments. Attorney Lebet then continued to speak, saying, "The military expenditures in 1934 and 1935 were not fully utilized. It was not until Daladier became Minister of the Army that huge sums of money were allocated for military expenditures and that he sought to have the parliament pass a bill to reorganize the armed forces. Initially, the total cost was 140 billion francs, which was later increased to 600 billion francs. It can be seen from this that Daladier had long wanted to reorganize the armed forces." Attorney Spanial, the attorney for former Prime Minister Blum, continued to speak, saying, "I absolutely agree with the speech given by Attorney Lebet because Blum was not in a key position at the beginning of the outbreak of the European War. Therefore, the Supreme Court is trying the political leaders for the crime of dereliction of duty, and Blum is not included. Who should bear this responsibility? The court should investigate." After finishing speaking, Blum himself spoke, saying, "The stage of transitioning from a state of peace to a state of war is the question that needs to be studied now. This stage did not occur before the Munich Agreement because at that time, maintaining peace can be fully proven. Therefore, the investigation of responsibility should begin in 1938, and if it is to be discussed from a political perspective, it should begin in 1939. The real crisis of the war began when the National Socialist Party came to power in 1933. France announced the end of its disarmament policy in 1934. What was the state of the country's military equipment when we came to power in 1936? Those who despised aviation and motorization equipment and only relied on static positional warfare were responsible for the defeat. Why don't you order these military leaders to come to court to confront us? You criticize the organization of the 'Popular Front,' but you must know that since 1934, there has been a conspiracy against the republic in France. Tauriot and Bechelet and others have acted arbitrarily and conspired to undermine national unity, which is why the Popular Front was formed. Therefore, these two people should also come to court to confront us." Finally, Prosecutor General Gassanou rose to speak, stating that insufficient military equipment and inadequate preparation were the main reasons for France's defeat. "We must know that only a few people are being questioned in court today. There are still many people who share responsibility for the defeat. We will prosecute the current and former ministers in accordance with the provisions of the law, but not the generals. It is a well-known rule that the generals who command the entire army must surrender themselves. Even if we investigate military figures who are liable, it will not add anything to today's trial. The reason why we must start the investigation from 1936 is that, according to what Daladier said in 1939, the crisis in Germany had become absolutely clear at that time because March 7, 1936, was the day the German army entered the Rhineland." After finishing speaking, Blum's defense attorney requested the court to show some case files concerning his client's opposition to communist propaganda. The court then adjourned at 5:00 PM.

### On the Qualities of a General, by Wavell (Part 3)

Regarding the physical attributes that a general should possess, I would also like to briefly mention that these are nothing more than courage, health, and vitality. As for his appearance, we need not dwell on that; a commanding presence is certainly desirable, but a good general, like a fine horse, must be able to "gallop in any posture." Physical bravery is no longer the primary factor in the promotion of officers, certainly a far cry from the old days of close combat; however, in the course of battle, the degree of risk a commander dares to take is still determined by courage, so it still occupies a very important position. Moreover, in mechanized warfare, we can again see generals supervising operations near the front lines, often taking the lead, even personally taking to the air to reconnoiter and issue commands!

To understand how intense the artillery fire was that generals faced in the old days of warfare, here is an example: in the Battle of Blenheim, Marlborough's attack on Schellenberg resulted in six lieutenant generals killed and five wounded in the Allied forces; the British suffered a total of 1,500 casualties, including four major generals, and 28 brigadier generals and lieutenant colonels. There is also a story about one of Napoleon's fierce generals, Marshal Lefebvre, Duke of Danzig. It is said that the Duke had a friend who was a civil official who, looking at his magnificent residence and other rewards he had obtained through military achievements, repeatedly expressed envy. The old general, tired of hearing this, said to him: "If you want these things, come with me to the garden and let me fire ten shots at you from a distance of forty paces. If you are lucky enough to survive, I will give you this house and everything in it." His friend, of course, would not allow such a thing. So the old general said: "Then forget about it. But you must know that before I got these things, I was in the line of fire, and hundreds of bullets flew at me from that close a distance!"

There is no doubt that a general must possess both physical and moral courage. Voltaire once said of Marlborough that he "displayed calm courage in the midst of the chaos of war, and remained as quiet as ever in the face of life and death, which is the best natural gift for a military commander." There is also a modern military writer who, although not a great admirer of Joffre, could not help but praise Joffre's stubborn calmness and firm determination, which he relied on during the desperate general retreat to offset several major strategic errors he had made. A general's health is naturally also a very important condition, but this condition is only relative. For example, if we have a sick Napoleon and several of his enemies before us, I think we would all prefer Napoleon to join our side and certainly not his enemies. The examples shown by Wolfe and others show that a fragile body can also contain a great spirit. When Marlborough was engaged in several great battles, if the modern department of medical and health were to examine his physique, they would most likely ask him to be exempt from service.

Next, when it comes to the age of a general, it is another contentious issue. An ancient Roman poet once said that old men have no reputation in war or in love. But it is difficult to determine at what age a general ceases to be feared by the enemy or a charming man ceases to be welcomed by the opposite sex. Judging by famous generals such as Hannibal, Alexander, Napoleon, Wellington, and Wolfe, it can be said that the highest honor of war should be attributed to young people. Conversely, we also see that Caesar and Cromwell did not begin their major campaigns until after the age of forty. Marlborough, at the age of sixty-one, broke through the so-called "impregnable" lines of defense, which was the most praised battle of his life; Turenne fought his last battle at the age of sixty-three, which is said to be one of the bravest and best of his life; Moltke, the leader of modern military personnel, did not become famous until he was sixty-six years old, and only began to enjoy great prestige at the age of seventy; Roberts went to Africa at the age of sixty-seven to avenge the shame of the British defeat, and finally besieged the Boer army in Paardeberg and captured Bloemfontein and Pretoria; Foch, at the age of sixty-seven, was still full of energy and creativity.

Although we use past generals for comparison, it should be known that today's soldiers mature later; for example, Wellington, Wolfe, Moore, Crawford, and others served at the age of fifteen or so, and some experienced battles soon after enlisting. It is difficult to accurately assess the heat and courage of youth and the clear judgment and extensive knowledge after a longer age to distinguish between the two; if a mature mind can still understand and absorb new ideas, can still endure unexpected setbacks, and still dares to implement bold and unconventional plans, then its rich knowledge and judgment are indeed superior to youth. But undoubtedly, a young good general can often defeat an old good general; the recent reduction in the age limit of British officers, to prevent the loss of talent, is indeed an appropriate move. As for virtue, I think there is no need to go into detail. No matter who it is, no matter how profound their knowledge, they can never become a leader without the natural gift of leadership. I think you all know the characteristics of a leader very well. I will mention it again in the second lecture. Now I will only mention a few of the most fundamental elements: a leader must have individuality - that is, he must be able to discern the purpose and have the courage and determination to achieve it; he should also be humane and understanding of the world, which is the foundation of a leader's conduct, and most importantly, he must possess the spirit of combat and the will to win. We often see this spirit on the sports field, for example, the side that is destined to lose can continue to compete with all its might, and those who have clearly failed can regain their strength and turn defeat into victory, and some, even though they have lost, will never admit defeat. But I think there is another difference in virtue that distinguishes a truly great military leader from an ordinary general, and that is that the former must possess a spirit of adventure, like the spirit of a gambler. Napoleon said: "If the art of war consists only in avoiding risks, then all honor belongs to mediocrities." So when he talked about a general, he asked whether he was "lucky." What he meant was whether he was bold. A general can be lucky, but the timid can never be lucky. A general who is content to be heavily bound by various rules and regulations has little hope of winning a battle. What will be the result of such a commander? Let me cite an example from naval history as a warning story."

About one hundred and seventy-five years ago, a cautious and seemingly mediocre admiral was pacing back and forth on the quarterdeck, discussing matters with the captain of the flagship. It turned out that an enemy fleet was passing by at this time, within striking distance, but the admiral was still studying whether the configuration of his attack was in line with the lengthy instructions recently issued by the Admiralty. But by the time the captain's reply had satisfied him, the enemy ships had already fled. The admiral was later court-martialed and shot for setting a bad example. If future generations, encouraged by this lesson, can indeed discard regulations when necessary, then this unlucky admiral will not have died in vain. In fact, only in times of peace do regulations and routines seem important, and bold and original ideas must be suppressed. But we see that many of Britain's famous generals, such as Cromwell, Marlborough, Wellington, and their subordinates Graham, Hill, and Crawford, served for very short periods during peacetime.

What has been said above is all about the physical and moral qualities of a general. Now let's move on to the intellectual characteristics. The most important thing is what is called common sense, in other words, the knowledge to distinguish what is possible and what is impossible. The foundation of common sense must be built on a sound understanding of the "war machine," namely topography, logistics, and supply. The true foundation of military knowledge is these, not strategy and tactics, as most people imagine. The reason why those amateur strategists miscalculate is because they do not understand the theory and practice of troop movement and management, which is what some people call "logistics." As for the principles of strategy, anyone with a little common sense can learn them in a short period of time. May I give a very broad example? A person who plans to spend a vacation can, based on their own decision or the opinions of others, prepare to travel to Egypt. That is very easy to decide; but further, they have to calculate the cost of the trip to Egypt, which must be compared with the length of the vacation and the size of their wallet. This is a difficult task. To give a political example, if there are many unemployed people and there is a job for the unemployed to do, everyone can think of it, but in practice, it is difficult to take into account the issues of action, housing, and economics.

Unfortunately, most military textbooks, because they attach too much importance to strategy and tactics, neglect the affairs of management and deployment. For example, military scholars all know how the Battle of Blenheim was won, but few know how to make various deployments and preparations before the battle to win the battle. Allenby's Third Battle of Gaza took months of deployment and preparation to succeed. The breakthrough of the "impregnable" line of defense in 1711 is Marlborough's most praised strategy, which is actually something that even a child can think of, but I am afraid that no one but Marlborough can accomplish it. In 1900, Roberts' Battle of Paardeberg and Allenby's Battle of Gaza-Beersheba in 1917 both applied the above-mentioned very simple strategy of Marlborough and modified it; but its implementation requires extremely flexible and careful deployment. Therefore, when you study military history, you should keep in mind that the affairs of management and deployment are an important factor, because the mistakes of general critics and many generals are in this area.

The Municipal Council's recurrent expenditure budget for last year was 80,109,770 yuan in revenue and 81,052,910 yuan in expenditure, with a shortfall of 943,170 yuan. The recurrent expenditure final account for last year was 89,445,000 yuan in revenue and 91,230,120 yuan in expenditure, resulting in a shortfall of 1,784,720 yuan. This figure is significantly reduced compared to the previous year's shortfall of 12 million yuan.

Various Tax Revenues Reduced Compared to the Past

As for this year's financial budget, it will change its approach due to the changing situation. It is expected that both revenue and expenditure will be greatly reduced. Since the shortage of gasoline and the restriction of car use, the revenue from car license fees has decreased by about 4 million yuan. Following the resolution of the Shanghai West tax issue, the tax revenue power has been transferred again. In addition, the revenue of more than 7 million yuan in the public utilities sector last year will also tend to decrease sharply this year due to the suspension of public buses and the reduced scope of other public utilities. Furthermore, the simultaneous closure of factories, companies, and firms has a great impact on the Municipal Council's revenue.

Expenditure Budget: Thoroughly Cut Spending

According to the latest estimate by the Municipal Council's Finance Department, the total revenue for this year is about 50 million yuan, a decrease of 30 million yuan compared to last year's revenue of more than 80 million yuan. Therefore, this year's expenditure budget will inevitably be greatly reduced accordingly. According to the Municipal Council's expenses in previous years, personnel expenses accounted for the largest part, and the cost of goods and equipment was about 20% to 30% of personnel expenses. In the future, thorough austerity measures may be implemented, and measures such as layoffs and salary reductions may be taken. Unnecessary groups such as the orchestra may also be disbanded.

Salaries and Allowances of Staff All Planned to Be Reduced

The February salaries of the Municipal Council's staff will also be reduced. The minimum salary has been revised to 500 yuan for unmarried staff, 1,000 yuan for married staff, 1,300 yuan for married staff with one child, and 1,500 yuan for married staff with more than one child. Staff who are unmarried or married without children and whose monthly salary exceeds the minimum salary by more than 500 yuan will have their salaries reduced by 20%. Married staff with children will have their salaries reduced by 10%. The maximum salary will be limited to 4,000 yuan. This is expected to save a total of 7 million yuan. In addition, the various allowances for staff totaled 2.5 million yuan last year, and an additional 650,000 yuan in pension funds was issued, totaling more than 3.1 million yuan. This expense is also planned to be reduced or abolished, and is currently under close consideration by the authorities.

Increase Revenue and Donations to Make Up for the Shortfall

After the personnel expenses are reduced in this way, about 10 million yuan can be saved, requiring more than 60 million yuan. In terms of the cost of goods and equipment, 5 million yuan can also be saved, requiring 12 million yuan, for a total expenditure of about 72 million yuan. If the total revenue is 50 million yuan, there is still a shortfall of 22 million yuan. This amount will probably be compensated by increasing revenue, such as increasing the donations for licenses for cars, bicycles, and other vehicles, as well as the fees for permits to transport controlled goods, which can increase revenue by about 5 million yuan. In the future, after the new rental regulations are implemented, a small amount of license fees can also be collected from second landlords.

Revenues and Expenditures for this Year Can Roughly Offset Each Other

Therefore, the revenues and expenditures for this year can roughly offset each other. However, the Municipal Council still has a deficit of 12 million yuan from previous years, and the outstanding debt is also as high as 89 million yuan, for a total debt of 111 million yuan. This huge amount of money still needs to be repaid by the authorities. On January 1 of this year, the Municipal Council originally intended to levy a special donation on business premises, but later decided to postpone the collection due to various reasons. If this special donation is levied, it is estimated that it can generate about 7 million yuan in revenue. However, in order to repay the entire debt, the issuance of public bonds is inevitable this year. As for special temporary expenses, short-term loans may be borrowed from banks to resolve them.

### Shanghai-Hong Kong Postal Service Temporarily Relayed via Guangzhou

According to a report from a reporter of the Datong News Agency who inquired at the Shanghai Postal Administration, the Transportation Department of the Administration, in respect of the mail from Shanghai to Hong Kong, except for registered mail, light mail would be accepted and sent as usual, and that the transport route would be via Guangzhou, because there were steamships sailing between Shanghai and Guangzhou, with two or three sailings each month. There are now two ships operating between Guangzhou and Hong Kong, sailing to and fro daily. Mail from Shanghai to Hong Kong, relayed via Guangzhou, would, if the sailings were properly coordinated, take only ten days to reach, or at most one month. If sent by air, it would arrive on the same day. According to the Shanghai-Guangzhou air service, there are flights every Monday, Wednesday and Friday, and the airmail, loaded on arrival in Guangzhou, can be loaded on ships sailing to Hong Kong on the same day, and transported there in the afternoon. Since Hong Kong underwent hostilities, postal facilities were managed and dispatched by the Japanese side in the name of the Field Postal Bureau. As to shipping between Hong Kong and overseas, this has not been restored. For overseas mail from Shanghai, only Vietnam and Thailand now have Japanese and French ships sailing, which can be directly shipped out. Mail for Germany is relayed via Turkey. Sea mail for Europe and America cannot be dispatched.

### Shanghai Municipal Council's Secretary-General Fessenden's Resignation Approved

Smythe Reappointed as Police Advisor According to the official announcement of the Shanghai Municipal Council's Information Office, Secretary-General and Chief Executive Fessenden recently submitted his resignation to the Board of Directors, effective March 1, which has been approved. The Shanghai Municipal Council's Information Office announced that Deputy Chief of the Council's Debt Department Smythe had submitted his resignation, which has been approved, but at the request of the Council, he has agreed to serve as an advisor to the Chief of Police.

### Revised Price of Foreign Rice Starting Tomorrow at $1.70 per liter

The Municipal Council recently announced that the maximum retail price of foreign rice will be revised to $1.70 per liter in national currency starting from Monday, the 23rd of this month. At the same time, broken rice will be sold at $1.40 per liter.

### Watari Takeshi Promoted to Chief of Police

According to the Shanghai Municipal Council's Information Office, Chief of Police Bowen requested leave from Shanghai in August of last year and was temporarily unable to return to his post. The position of Chief, left vacant, could not be left vacant for long. The Council has resolved to promote the current Chief Deputy Chief of Police, Watari Takeshi, to the position of Chief of Police.

### Increased Compensation for Photo Studio Staff

Photo studio staff in the concession have requested that employers consider the hardships of staff and modestly increase their compensation to ensure their livelihood, because prices have risen exorbitantly and endlessly, and the burden of living has increased day by day, while their salaries have been difficult to sustain a living. Employers have generally found it difficult to accept the demands of staff because business has declined significantly recently and daily support has been difficult. After extensive negotiations between representatives of both labor and management, agreement was finally reached yesterday and a contract was signed as follows: Employers will increase special allowances for workers as follows: A. Workers earning less than 100 yuan per month will receive an allowance of 10 yuan. B. Workers earning more than 100 yuan per month will be subsidized by employers at 12 yuan and 50 cents. Year-end bonuses for workers will be issued in accordance with industry-wide announcements. It is said that the agreement has been implemented since February of this year.

### Japanese Textile Mill Further Reduces Work

According to the Tongmeng News Agency in Zhabei, the Japanese textile mills in this city had agreed at a meeting on February 10 to reduce work by another one-tenth from March 1. Since the outbreak of the Pacific War, the Japanese textile mills have reduced their scope of work to four-tenths due to power saving and lack of imported raw materials. Now that it has been reduced by one-tenth again, its scope of work is only three-tenths of what it was before the outbreak of the Pacific War. If there are no changes in the situation in the future, this new method will be maintained until the end of August. It is also heard that Chinese textile mills with existing raw materials are still working in proportion to the halving of work, but they will soon be drastically reduced again.

### Three Withdrawals from Banks of Allied Powers Difficult to Realize Recently; But Two Banks Have Already Recovered Huge Loans

The foreign banks in this city resumed operations at 10 am on the 19th, after the Spring Festival holiday, simultaneously with Chinese banks. The banks of the Allied Powers, such as Hui Feng and Maccary, also continued to implement the measures implemented before the Spring Festival holiday, paying the deposits of individual depositors, and opening safe deposit boxes. All restrictions remained unchanged. Only three banks, HSBC, Maccary, and Chase, opened safe deposit boxes. The number of people going to open and withdraw items has been very small. All banks were able to handle it within office hours.

Commercial Firms' Expenses Not Yet Approved

The opening method of the safe deposit box of Chase Bank, its restrictions are originally strict, only allowing the extraction of contract documents, and the handling of the transfer of legal currency, may be eased in the future. As for the application for the necessary expenses of commercial firms, as of now, no approval has been obtained. The application forms that have been filled out for review are still under consideration by the banks. It is also learned that the hope of the Japanese side approving the third withdrawal by the banks of the Allied Powers to handle the liquidation is difficult to realize recently. Many people in the banking industry believe that the realization of the third withdrawal still needs to wait until after January or February.

Recovery of Loans Varies from Bank to Bank

At present, at least two of the banks of the Allied Powers are able to pay for the third withdrawal. They have already repaid huge amounts of cash borrowed from various main loans, and in the near future, they can also expect to recover huge loans. However, the debt collection situation of other banks is not so smooth. Many believe that the Japanese side may allow most of the banks of the Allied Powers to handle the third withdrawal, and whether they will be allowed to withdraw again in the future, or whether it will be the last time, is unknown.

### Case of Huge Robbery of 300,000 Yuan; Six Members of the Gang Arrested; Only a Small Part of the Original Stolen Goods Recovered; Two Main Culprits Still at Large

At 7 am on January 16 of this year, a Nanjing money house sent 300,000 yuan to Shanghai, dispatching staff Guo Chengyi and Chen Wenquan, hiding them in three small leather suitcases, and hiring rickshaws. When passing near the intersection of North Henan Road and Haining Road, they were suddenly attacked by four robbers, who pulled out their guns, dragged Guo and others into nearby No. 360 Heng, forbidding them to make any noise, and snatched the huge sum of money, fleeing in different directions. Guo immediately followed and reported to the police, drew his gun and chased, resulting in the shooting and killing of the brutal robber Liu Xiaobazi, a native of Jiangbei, but all the stolen money was taken away by his accomplices, making it impossible to find. Yesterday, the Chinese detectives of the Huizhong Concession Police Station, Feng Baishun and Huang Fusen, detective Yang Yunfeng, and detective Guo Xiangyao, based on a confidential tip, at No. 9 Robert Road, No. 155 Bai Linan Road, No. 1 Wulin Village, Kang Nao Tu Road, Jisi Fei'er Road and other places, successively arrested Wu Xiaobao, the wife of the slain robber Liu Xiaobazi, who confessed to five accomplices, including Zhu Dasizi, Xu Changsong, the woman Zhang Liu, Xu Zhu, and Min Qian. They were successively arrested at their addresses, and a part of the original stolen goods was seized, totaling more than 13,000 yuan. They confessed that the four leaders, Xiaogouzi and Xiaolucai, were at large, hiding in Nanjing. The two detectives, Feng and Huang, who were handling the case, immediately went to Nanjing. They learned that Xiaolucai was staying at a friend's house at No. 189 Gonghe Road and rushed to arrest him, but he had already fled upon hearing the news, and only a leather suitcase of the original thief was seized. The police station, considering that the robbery involved a huge sum of money, that a large amount of stolen money had not been recovered, and that the leaders and robbers were at large, detained the six men and women, including Wu Xiaobao, pending further investigation.

### 3,000 Cases of Anglo-American Merchants' Stored Tobacco Will Be Supplied to Shanghai Market

### Jardine Matheson Chinese Staff Request Dismissal

Jardine Matheson & Co., a British merchant firm, has been established for more than 100 years and is the oldest and largest merchant firm in terms of maritime history, with the largest amount of capital. In the past, it has made profits of millions. This time, its business has suffered a major impact, so in addition to the continuing operation of the large book office, the import department, and the cotton weaving department, it will dismiss more than 1,000 Chinese staff in the remaining eleven departments, including the telegraph department, the insurance department, the anti-smuggling department, the transshipment department, the small book office, the ship's head department, the foreign ship department, the tea room department, the machinery department, the silk building department, and the silk head department, and issue each person two months' salary and cancel the double salary of one month at the end of the year.

### Silk and Cloth Merchant Couple Accuse Maid of Theft

Yang Jianzhi, a native of Anhui, is 29 years old, resides at No. 289 Sapposai Road, and works at the Silk and Cloth Exchange. He married a woman named Fang (30 years old, a native of Anhui), a former teacher, who is now unemployed at home. At 6 pm yesterday, Fang falsely accused Zhai Wang, the maid of the sub-letter Chen Ximao (37 years old, a native of Shaoxing), of stealing leather shoes, and a quarrel broke out. Yang and his wife beat Zhai Wang's left eye until it was swollen and bleeding, and seriously injured her right-hand finger with an object. Chen Ximao reported to the police, who took Yang and his wife into custody and sent Zhai Wang to Guangci Hospital to treat her injuries.

### Zhijiang Church Worship
Zhijiang Church Worship　　Since Zhijiang Church moved to the Dahua Cinema for worship, the number of people attending worship has increased daily. Last Sunday happened to be the Spring Festival, so Dahua had an early movie showing, which caused many people to arrive late and be turned away without being able to worship together. Starting this Sunday, the original worship time will be restored, beginning at 10:30 AM on Sunday mornings. Mr. Zhou Zhiyu will be in charge of preaching, and the Jule Troupe will sing hymns, still under the guidance of Professor Zhao Meibo. We hope for enthusiastic participation.

Chinese Christian Moral Association Flag Gruel

The Tongfu Road Chinese Christian Moral Association has been very active in various relief efforts. Recently, during the Lunar New Year, the lives of the poor were difficult, and the number of beggars on the streets increased. The association continues its past spirit and continues to provide relief to benefit the poor. However, funds are very depleted, and it is hoped that people from all walks of life will provide assistance to ensure its continuation.

Information from the Music Education Advancement Association

The Music Education Advancement Association previously established music courses to generally select geniuses, teaching specialized techniques in music theory, composition, violin, piano, and vocal music, and recruited 200 free trial students.

Anyone interested in learning music can request regulations and apply to the association at No. 16, Lane 215, Maitehesi Road (intersection of Jing'an Temple Road). It is also heard that the association has added common music, sight-singing, chorus, and teacher training group lectures, hiring experts to preside over them. The association's curriculum adopts the standards of the former National Conservatory of Music and refers to the latest Western teaching methods, making it the most perfect music education institution in Shanghai.

Death Statistics on French Concession Roads

The weather has been mild recently, but the cost of living in Shanghai is extremely high, making it impossible for ordinary poor people, drug addicts, and beggars to make a living. As a result, they suffer from hunger and cold and cannot resist, leading to death and corpses lying on the roadside, which has increased sharply compared to before. According to investigations within the French Concession, since New Year's Eve (when it rained and snowed all day), the bodies of 130 to 140 men and women have been found dead on the roads in the past week, mostly men, with only about 20 women, averaging nearly 30 people per day. Except for those with family members, the Tongren Fuyuan Branch handles the burial arrangements.

All Police Agencies Schedule 20 Days of Alert Drills

Shanghai's police agencies have decided to conduct 20 days of drills for alerting to terrorist incidents, and issued the following advance notice: To prevent the occurrence of terrorist incidents, the authorities and the city ruler will conduct drills to arrest criminals.

New Trends in Construction Industry

This year, the construction of new houses in the Public Concession seems to be concentrated on Chinese-style houses. The construction of subdivided buildings and Western-style houses is less sought after, and the construction of storage warehouses is also slightly active. However, the number of new houses built has decreased by more than half compared to last year. In December last year, 194 applications for building houses were filed in the Public Concession, and 129 were approved. The estimated value of the new houses built totaled more than 9.9 million yuan. In January this year, only 93 applications for building houses were filed, and only 67 were approved. The total value of these new houses is 1.4423 million yuan, accounting for about one-seventh of December last year. Among the new houses approved for construction in January, there were 44 Chinese-style houses, 4 warehouses, 2 Western-style houses, and 1 subdivided building. The distribution of new houses is the highest in the western district of the Public Concession, followed by the eastern district, the central district is less, and the northern district is the least.

Kidnapping of the Young Owner of a Plank Box Shop

Later, the bandits sent a letter saying that the child was living safely in Jiangyin and that a ransom of 40,000 yuan was required. Subsequently, the French Concession Police arrested a group of male and female criminals including Zhu Wenlong. The Qian family paid the ransom to retrieve the child. In this case, Zhu Wenlong, Wang Xiaolang, Ding Changqiao, Zhou Heshang, and Xia Heshang were each sentenced to seven years, and Ding Mao, Xia Yan, and others were each sentenced to two years, as a warning.

Bright Spring Scenery Talks About Newlyweds

Wu Zhe

The birds are singing and the flowers are fragrant, spring has arrived, and young people feel an indescribable joy at this time, especially those who have just gotten married. Speaking of the word "newlyweds," according to the definition of the ancients, all women who have been married are newlyweds. If you think about the joy of this night, which can be the same as several ordinary nights, you will know that the consumption of this night can also be the same as several ordinary nights. Only by ensuring that this night is not harmed by marital injuries can you really talk about the strange labors of newlyweds. Flattering to gain favor, and also enduring different fatigue, bravely crossing the river, not knowing when to advance or retreat in moderation, and later seeing it, it is inevitable to suffer major setbacks, even exhaustion, and heavy problems. Like neurasthenia, poor memory, dull thinking, kidney deficiency and physical weakness, "Brain Kidney Ding" is the most powerful tonic for modern times. Everyone knows that this tonic can nourish the brain, strengthen the kidneys, consolidate essence, and increase strength. It is a unique and effective tonic that works repeatedly and is effective in hundreds of trials. Moreover, the medicinal properties are mild and the medicinal power is long-lasting. Men, women, old and young, can all take it, and it is suitable for all seasons. "Brain Kidney Ding" is sold in company pharmacies. General Manager Lu Jixing's Enlightenment

Reduced Incidence of Virulent Infectious Diseases

Improved Sanitation

The sanitation situation in this port has changed little in the past month. The number of patients reported with virulent infectious diseases is very small, and there is no sign of spreading in the near future.

The recorded number of Chinese deaths is 4,217, of which 2,759 were found dead on the streets. A total of 357 people died from infectious diseases, with the most suffering from tuberculosis, pneumonia, and bronchitis. The recorded number of deaths for foreigners is 117, of which 50 were Japanese and 25 were German Jewish refugees. The cause of death was mostly respiratory diseases such as tuberculosis and pneumonia. Measles, which had disappeared in the past two months, reappeared last month. The number of cases of influenza and smallpox also increased slightly last month, while the number of Chinese patients with diphtheria decreased by more than half compared to the previous month.

A Year Ago in Shanghai (1)

Translated by Wu Yancun

When travelers cross the East China Sea towards Shanghai, they will find that the vast blue sea suddenly turns into a muddy yellow stream. Above that is where the Yangtze River, 3,200 miles long, empties. This is the soil moved from Central China, and 188 million people live on this soil, which is roughly half of the "400 million customers." Shanghai, the gateway to Central China, still needs about five hours of sailing after crossing the border of this clear and turbid sea. During these five hours, the number of ships entering and exiting gradually increases, and what comes into view are the flags of various countries, such as the Sun Flag, the Union Jack, and the Stars and Stripes, but it is not easy to find Chinese ships. "There are so many foreign ships!" When thinking like that, although they have not yet reached the urban area of Shanghai, based on the foreign ships sailing on the mudflow, the initial impression is not far from the truth. Indeed, Shanghai is not only the center of Central China, but also the international economic center of the entire China!

Now, due to the results of the Second European War, the international economies of various countries in the world are showing abnormal conditions and have lost their original meaning. The world is divided into several economic groups, such as Britain and the United States, Germany and Italy, the Soviet Union, Japan, etc. Each has formulated self-sufficiency plans within its scope and gathered to form small organizations. However, in normal times, regardless of large or small countries, mutually exchanging goods, circulating funds, developing transportation, and people interacting with each other are all part of the international economy.

China is a part of the East Asian economy, which is parallel to Japan. At the same time, because of the opposing relationship, it is even more important. The reason for the opposition, in the simplest sentence, is because Japan is a semi-industrial country, while China is a raw material country. All countries are searching for raw materials from China and promoting goods. Carl Crow did not call the Chinese "400 million customers" without reason. (Translator's note: Carl Crow is a Shanghai advertiser, and "400 Million Customers" is the name of a book he wrote about China.)

In this way, China's international economy, which is centered on trade, naturally focuses on marine transportation. Now, because of the Japanese navy's coastal blockade, the Chinese inland is using the northwest and Myanmar routes. Originally, the problem of the transportation capacity of land trade had not occurred. All trade was almost entirely concentrated in the 26 commercial ports along the coast from Qinhuangdao in North China to Beihai in South China. Moreover, among these thirty-six commercial ports, only a few are directly related to foreign countries, and most are only indirectly connected because they are central locations connecting various regions. In North China, the center of such international economic activities is Tianjin and Qingdao, and in South China, it is Hong Kong. Further analysis shows that Central China is of course Shanghai as a major central location, and Shanghai is not only the center of Central China, but also the international economic center of the entire China.

After another hour, when the ship approached the famous Wusong Fort on the starboard side, we turned from the main stream of the Yangtze River into the tributary of the Huangpu River. In a broad sense, the port of Shanghai starts from here, and the port of Huangpu itself can be said to be the port of Shanghai. Later, turning left and right along the Huangpu River, on the right side, called Pudong, first see the huge oil tanks of the Anglo-American capital oil companies such as Mobil Company, Asiatic Company, and Texaco Company. Some oil tankers fly the Union Jack or the Stars and Stripes in the wind, and some are docked beside the pier. Like that, about 60 million liters of oil are transported to Shanghai every year, taking 1939 as an example, about 12 million liters were imported from the United States, and about 52 million liters were imported from the Dutch East Indies, with a price of 16 million yuan in legal currency. At a certain time, the oil stored in the Shanghai oil tanks from the United States and the Dutch East Indies was transferred to various ships on the Yangtze River and the tributaries of the Yangtze River and was widely distributed to various places in Central China. There is also a definite fact that about 40% of the oil from the Dutch East Indies is capital supplied by the British, and the promotion in the Chinese market is also handled by the British-owned Asiatic Company.

The public debt black market continued to fall yesterday. Although Tongyi and Dingyu rose up to buy strongly, they still failed to reverse the decline. Morale is still weak. However, although the downward trend has not stopped, every time the price falls, the transaction is greatly reduced. Now it has returned to its old state. Only one or two companies sold in large quantities, and one or two companies bought in enough to offset the sales. However, during this downward trend, many parties took advantage of the low price to absorb, and they were also unwilling to raise the price. It was found that there were no major reasons for this downward trend, mostly due to head positions and the supply and demand of chips. For example, the two companies with larger sales were Hengkang and Tongshun, but they were taken up in full by Dingyu and Tongyi. The remaining sales of Hu Heji and Tongxing were not significant. The market price has fallen for three consecutive days, and it may be slightly suppressed in the future.
