### Discussion on the Price Problem

Although the price problem is not a new one in Shanghai, it has been seriously threatening the lives of millions of citizens in Shanghai day by day in recent years. If there is no proper and perfect countermeasure to this problem, the impact on the lives of all Shanghai citizens is self-evident, and even the entire peace zone cannot but suffer serious consequences. Recently, it was reported that the Sino-Japanese Chamber of Commerce has jointly formed an economic committee to seek new countermeasures for prices. This is very important to the citizens. We respectfully offer the following suggestions:

First of all, we must understand the crux of the price problem in order to find a fundamental solution; otherwise, it will inevitably be "doing twice the work with half the results," just like past efforts. Practical observation shows that the occurrence of the price problem is due to (1) a certain degree of inflation of currency; (2) hoarding; (3) sluggish production; and (4) an increase in the degree of demand for war materials after the war, resulting in a certain degree of shortage of materials. In addition, the stagnation of transportation and transport has also, to a certain extent, directly and indirectly aggravated the price problem, but the main crux lies in the four major reasons mentioned above. Because, if the increase in currency issuance does not find a way to make it "recirculate," or does not find a way to introduce it into productive enterprises, then those additional chips will promote the rise in prices. What's more, those who hold mobile assets are desperately looking for all opportunities to engage in speculation and hoarding. The more they hoard, the higher the prices rise. The higher the prices rise, the greater the expenditures of the government and various agencies, and therefore the issuance of currency continues to increase. On the other hand, due to the coercion of mobile assets, the temptation of the profiteering of speculation and hoarding, and other environmental reasons, production is becoming increasingly sluggish, while the degree of consumption of materials in various aspects is increasing day by day. In this way, materials are in short supply, showing a huge distance between supply and demand, which in turn promotes high prices and speculation and hoarding activities. If we want to thoroughly solve the price problem, we must grasp the above four fundamental reasons that affect each other and start from here, that is; we must tighten the currency, strictly prohibit hoarding, develop production, conserve consumption, and increase materials.

First, in terms of tightening the currency, it is hoped that the amount of issuance will be reduced. At the same time, the government must implement thrift, avoid any waste, must cut down parallel institutions, and severely punish acts of fraud, self-interest, and corruption and extravagance. Accumulate to make the issued currency and private mobile assets invested in the production enterprises necessary for the stability of the national life. Second, in terms of banning hoarding, we must conduct thorough investigations, and what should be duly noted is that we cannot rely solely on intelligence and accusations, because these can only be used as a reference in case of emergency. As for the investigation and registration procedures, they must be simple, and the registration time may be extended. For finance, the secret operation of commercial firms by a small number of banks and money houses to carry out hoarding should be strictly prohibited. As for hoarding households, we should start from the big ones, crack down on them at high places, punish one as a warning to a hundred, and never just focus on small hoarding households, ignore big hoarding tigers, and even more so, do not indulge big hoarding tigers out of face, giving people a bad impression. Third, in terms of increasing production, we must do our best to support private industries, especially small-scale production enterprises. Not only should we abolish all unreasonable obstacles, but we should also actively provide assistance. In terms of raw material collection, capital adjustment, transportation of products, and donations and taxes, the Sino-Japanese authorities must provide more convenience to private industry and commerce. Fourth, in terms of material cooperation, in order to supply the needs of the Greater East Asia War, the people must truly endure suffering; however, the authorities should have a unified and reasonable method, and should do everything possible to reduce the inconvenience and suffering of the people, especially small and medium-sized industrial and commercial enterprises.

In addition, the most important thing is that in the control or management of materials and prices, we must pay attention to the following points; first, the executive agencies must be unified, so as to avoid the suffering of the industrial and commercial sectors from "not knowing what to do," and also increase work efficiency. Secondly, for all industries and businesses, we must adopt an attitude of assistance everywhere, and we cannot rely solely on principles, solely on orders, and we must avoid rash punishment, so that producers do not know what to do. Third, the procedures for control and management must be as simple, rapid, and flexible as possible, because one second of delay by the competent authority will cause great losses to all industries and businesses. Finally, regarding the personnel for control and management, they must be selected with extreme caution, because "having a governing law but not having a governing person" will ruin the excellent methods.

What we want to solemnly appeal to the authorities is that the price problem is a major problem at present, which cannot be solved by a single order, a principle, or one or two institutions. We must start from the root and at the same time obtain the cooperation of the people.

Translations and Commentary

### Recent New Lineup in Europe - Editorial of the Tokyo Nichinichi Shimbun on December 22

On the 19th, a meeting of representatives from Germany, Italy, and France was held at the German General Headquarters. Following this, on the 20th, it was announced in Lisbon that Spain and Portugal had formed the Iberian Union.

Both of these events are of great significance. Regarding the former, although the results of the talks have not been announced, France must be the center of the agenda, and the content of the talks is not difficult to guess. Since the United States and Britain invaded North Africa, France's international status has suddenly entered a delicate state. Therefore, the Vichy government has the need to re-explicitly express its cooperation with the Axis powers. In fact, both Pétain and Laval have declared full cooperation against the Axis. It goes without saying that further discussions on the matter of full cooperation have to be held. The meeting on the 19th under the auspices of Hitler was probably this meeting for discussions.

The formation of the Iberian connection is no less important than the French issue in terms of its significance. In terms of geographical relations, the Iberian Peninsula is of great importance in this decisive war. Therefore, due to the US-British offensive in North Africa, it has suddenly placed itself at the center of the war. It is like a leaf drifting in a violent wind. As far as the peninsula itself is concerned, being in such a situation also involves great danger. Every move it makes can have a great impact on the belligerent countries. Now, the US-British invading forces are not only stalled on the Tunisian line, but, due to the Axis counter-offensive, they are instead retreating backwards. The US and Britain originally resort to any means to achieve their aggressive goals. It is impossible to know what they will do now that the expeditionary forces in North Africa are at a crossroads of life and death.

In the west of the Iberian Peninsula, Spain and Portugal stood upright before this crisis and established a strong connection; this is a matter of rejoicing not only for the two countries themselves, but also for the entire future of the war. (Translated by Mu)

### Records of the East Asia Economic Roundtable Conference (2) Translated from the late November issue of "Domei Juho" (Allied Ten-Day Report)

Speeches by Representatives

Mr. Ruan Zhenduo, Minister of Economy of Manchukuo

Mr. Ruan Zhenduo, Minister of Economy of Manchukuo, reviewed the ten-year history of Manchukuo's construction. During the first five years after the founding of the nation, all efforts were devoted to the preparation of basic matters. From the fourth year of Kangde (1937), he hoped to strengthen national defense production capacity on this foundation and establish a self-sufficient system, thus starting the First Five-Year Industrial Development Plan. Soon after, in view of the outbreak of the China Incident, it became necessary to expand and strengthen the plan dramatically.

Subsequently, the Second World War, the German-Soviet war, and the Greater East Asia War broke out one after another, creating many difficult situations. However, thanks to the unified spirit of cooperation between Japan and Manchukuo, these difficulties were overcome one by one, and the following results were achieved:

The main achievements of each sector of the First Five-Year Plan, with the year Kangde 3 (1936) as 100, the actual results in Kangde 8 (1941) were:

In the agricultural sector: sorghum 116%, millet 115%, corn 148%, rice 330%, oats 383%, cotton 156%, kenaf 232%, flax 546%, wild silk 129%, tobacco 1,083%, sugar beet 456%.

In the commercial production sector: horses 105%, cattle 120%, pigs 109%, sheep 125%, wool 130%

In the mining and industrial sector: pig iron 219%, steel ingots 154, steel材 264%, coal 178%, lead 1,223%, zinc 398%, copper 517%, asbestos 4,828%, ammonium sulfate 104%, salt 150%, soda ash 545%, sodium carbonate 3,500%, lead 1,666%, Pulp 790% (made from soft linen, cotton cloth, or bark, etc. Translator's note), liquid fuel 160%.

In general, compared with the results before the implementation of the plan, it is undeniable that there has been a leap forward.

Welcoming the tenth anniversary of the founding of the country this year, under the new situation, Manchukuo is attempting to establish and implement the Second Economic Construction Plan. As its fundamental policy, we want to aim at the rapid establishment of a self-sufficient economy within the East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, fully accomplish the important mission of constructing and developing basic industries suitable for Manchukuo's resources, and develop and promote industries that must be established locally. At the same time, in view of the achievements of the First Economic Construction, we hope to strive for the balanced development of various industrial fields, so that comprehensive economic strength can be enriched and enhanced.

According to the above fundamental policy, the scope of planned industries is roughly as follows:

First, as advantageous basic resource industries suitable for Manchuria, and which make a great contribution to the establishment of a self-sufficient sphere economy, such as agricultural products, iron and steel, hydroelectric power generation, coal, light metals, salt, organic synthetic chemical products, etc. Among them, special emphasis should be placed on iron and steel and agricultural products.

Second, many industries that are necessary to be maintained locally as a frontline base. In order to enhance these planned industries, the cultivation and maintenance of daily necessities industries and light industries, which aim to enrich and supplement the comprehensive economic strength, are also important tasks that cannot be ignored. When carrying out the above tasks, on the one hand, existing equipment should be utilized and mobilized, and at the same time, new equipment should be saved, and the utilization of local resources and indigenous capital should be promoted as much as possible.

In addition to the above plans, the wartime emergency economic countermeasures currently being implemented in our country include the following:

First, to enhance the production of wartime essential materials in Japan in order to increase the supply to Japan.

Second, to strive to save the consumption of essential materials and thoroughly encourage the use of substitutes for these materials in order to contribute to the enrichment of war resources. In terms of producing essential materials, we must strive to suppress expectations of Japan in order to improve domestic self-sufficiency. At the same time, the capacity for allocation and consumption must be strengthened even more.

Third, to carefully reflect on the adoption of a uniform control method for the economic system, and in connection with the control of production, distribution, consumption, and prices, to make comprehensive adjustments to the current system in order to completely rationalize the system and its operation.

Fourth, in view of the stability of finance and currency as an absolute foundation for carrying out a long-term economic war, on the one hand, to establish a firm method for dealing with all special circumstances, and at the same time, in order to enhance savings, to launch the Kyowa Kai movement, the National Savings Movement, and to promote the absorption of purchasing power through "increased new taxes" and other measures. Also, in order to prevent malignant inflation, on the one hand, to reorganize and improve the allocation mechanism and rationalize the allocation, and at the same time, to create an economic balance fund system to give the greatest attention to the implementation of wartime price policy.

### Allied Counteroffensive Thwarted, North African War Situation Gradually Stabilizes, German Troops Consolidate Positions West of Tunis Port, Axis Powers Claim Air Supremacy

Berlin, 29th, Domei News Agency - According to news from the North African front here, since the 25th, British and American forces have launched several counteroffensives in the Atlas Mountains area in an attempt to recapture various key points, but they have been repelled by the Axis forces. The Axis forces are still firmly defending the key points in the eastern Atlas Hills. In addition, a large unit of the French Foreign Legion, with tanks as the vanguard, attempted to counterattack the central Tunisian front, but was also repelled. Recently, the entire war situation seems to have entered a stable state. In addition, the Axis air force has repeatedly bombed the anti-Axis military concentrations and transportation vehicles and railways in the Tunisian border area, destroying two anti-Axis reconnaissance aircraft. A U.S. military depot near Mejez el Bab was hit and destroyed.

Tangier, 29th, Huitong News Agency - A communique from the Allied Headquarters in Tunisia stated that due to heavy rain in Tunisia, there has been no major battle. British and American forces have intensified reconnaissance work and have had several minor contacts with the enemy, with some prisoners taken.

Bern, Switzerland, 28th, Havas News Agency - There was frequent activity on both sides of the North African front yesterday. According to German sources, after the German forces occupied the town of Mejez el Bab, they immediately began to consolidate their positions. Mejez el Bab is located 20 miles southwest of Tebourba, with a population of about 2,500. It is the railway center west of Tunis and the key to the Mejerda River basin. U.S. forces had built good fortifications here, but the U.S. forces did not resist when the Axis forces attacked. The area is now completely in the hands of the German forces. From here south, west of Zaghouan, near the Fass Bridge, the German forces yesterday repelled the British and American allied forces and occupied several strategic high grounds. West of Kairouan, the German forces also occupied a mountain pass and several high grounds, which are sufficient to control the highway from Kairouan to Bizerte. So far, the British and American forces have lost the good positions they had previously occupied and have been forced to withdraw westward into the mountains. In addition, yesterday, U.S. aircraft bombed the ports of Bizerte and Sfax, and five four-engine bombers were shot down by German forces. The British air force also attempted to bomb the port of Bizerte, but was intercepted by German Messerschmitt 109 aircraft, which shot down several British aircraft. German aircraft also bombed the transportation lines of the port of Algiers and the enemy convoy near the port of Bougie. An enemy cargo ship of 10,000 tons was hit and damaged. In addition, the Italian air force also bombed the port of Bône at night, and several fires were seen after being hit. They also strafed the enemy barracks near Black Cape. Another enemy convoy was attacked in the waters off North Africa, and an enemy giant freighter was sunk.

Rome, 29th, Huitong News Agency - An article in the Italian "Aviation Magazine" stated that the timetable for the British and American invasion of French North Africa has been shelved due to the interference of the Axis air force. The Axis air force, departing from Sicily and Sardinia, prevented the British and American forces from landing in Bizerte, so the British and American forces had to land at unfavorable bases. The Axis forces were able to dispatch a large army to land in Tunisia in the shortest possible time, also thanks to the assistance of the air force. Axis transport aircraft transported a large number of troops to Tunisia in adverse weather conditions. In the first phase of the Tunisian war, the Axis air force has achieved air supremacy in the area. In the second phase of the war, the Axis aircraft still occupy a considerable important position, assisting the Axis forces on the ground to expand and consolidate their occupied positions. In the first phase of the war, all the Axis air force's ground paper weaving industry has been completed, and the difficulties encountered have also been solved.

### Calcutta Suffers Fifth Air Raid, India's Wartime Industrial Center, Japanese Aviator Discusses Night Attack

Lisbon, 29th, Domei News Agency - According to a British communique from New Delhi issued here today, Japanese aircraft attacked Calcutta (the fifth attack in eight days) and two other locations in eastern India at 4:00 a.m. on Monday. After the fifth attack on Calcutta, several fires broke out. Japanese aircraft concentrated on bombing military industrial facilities. The British communique also stated that it could not guarantee that Calcutta would be completely free from Japanese air raids. Calcutta is the center of British war industry in India. It was first attacked by Japanese aircraft on December 20, and then bombed three more times on the 22nd, 24th, and 25th.

Tokyo, 29th, Domei News Agency - Army Air Force Captain Miyajima, who participated in the fourth attack on Calcutta, recently revealed that Japanese aircraft heavily damaged military targets in Calcutta, the largest air base in eastern India. Japanese aircraft bombed military targets in Calcutta three times on December 20, 22, and 24, and then attacked the area for the fourth time on the night of December 25. Captain Miyajima described the experience to a Yomiuri Hochi Shimbun reporter as follows: "When our aircraft departed from the base and flew across the Indian Ocean, the moonlight was bright, but we flew west for a long time in a strong wind of 50 meters per second before reaching the skies over the Bay of Bengal. Dense fog obscured our vision. When we first saw land, we caught a glimpse of the Ganges estuary shimmering in the moonlight. Our aircraft forcefully formed a battle formation and ascended again. After a while, the moonlight was bright and the ground below was exceptionally clear. We then consulted the map and flew north, finally reaching Calcutta at 1:20 a.m. The city seemed to be asleep under perfect light control. However, as soon as our aircraft reached the skies over the city, the high-altitude artillery unit near Fort William suddenly roared, and the high-altitude artillery unit at Alipore airfield in the south of the city also fired fiercely. Shells exploded around the aircraft like shimmering fireworks. Our aircraft dived low and dropped bombs on targets such as King George's Dockyard, Dum Dum Airfield, and Alipore Airfield. When we finished the mission and started to fly back, we saw four fires breaking out at King George's Dockyard, indicating that the bombing was successful. At the same time, we also saw aircraft from the Hinode unit still bombing the oil tanks around the dockyard. We did not encounter any enemy aircraft resistance at that time. After leaving Calcutta, our aircraft reduced its altitude and saw that the friendly aircraft were following behind, which was very gratifying. Not long after returning to the base, the Hinode unit, which had destroyed eight enemy oil tanks, also returned safely. The fourth long and short-range bombing of Calcutta has been completely successful."

### Fuzawa Returns Home, Delivers Speech, Satisfied With Japan-Vietnam Talks

Although the Vietnamese people are living under wartime conditions, their lives are still quite peaceful, and they have an ample supply of food. His economic negotiations with Decoux have been progressing smoothly and are quite satisfactory. The negotiations will consider the basic issues in the same way as those discussed this year. The French authorities have expressed an unusually cooperative attitude on this matter. Japan will maintain its established policy towards Vietnam and will not deviate from its current goals. American aircraft may reappear in the skies over northern Vietnam, but the measures taken by Decoux and the French military authorities have maintained general order and peace to the greatest extent possible.

### Regulations for the Establishment and Promulgation of the Three Provinces Taxation Bureau and Investigation Office

Nanjing, 29th (Central News Agency) - The Ministry of Finance, considering the numerous unified taxation matters in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces, and to facilitate micro-collection, has abolished the Taxation General Bureau. It has separately established the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Provincial Taxation Bureaus, as well as the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Provincial Stamp, Tobacco, and Alcohol Tax Bureaus. Simultaneously, branch bureaus are established in various counties, responsible for handling the collection of unified taxes, stamp, tobacco, and alcohol taxes within their respective provincial areas. The heads of the respective provincial bureaus have also been officially appointed. It is reported that the Ministry of Finance has already formulated and promulgated the organizational regulations for the aforementioned provincial taxation bureaus and stamp, tobacco, and alcohol tax bureaus to begin their organizational establishment.

Nanjing, 29th (Central News Agency) - The Ministry of Finance is actively promoting taxation matters. Previously, the Central Tax Police Corps, directly under the Ministry, was responsible for investigating and cracking down on tax evasion. Now, considering that the Central Tax Police Corps is of great importance for investigating and cracking down on salt smuggling and other matters, and may inevitably have shortcomings, it has been decided to organize provincial tax investigation offices, responsible for assisting the provincial taxation bureaus and stamp, tobacco, and alcohol tax bureaus in investigating and cracking down on tax evasion. It is reported that the Ministry has now officially promulgated the organizational regulations and has formally organized and established these offices, commencing their work.

### Express Shipping Between Jiaxing and Haiyan to Begin on New Year's Day

Jiaxing, 29th (Central News Agency) - Since the commencement of rural pacification in Jiaxing, the market has become increasingly prosperous, and transportation has become increasingly developed. Fixed boats travel back and forth from various pacified areas. However, there are still no direct boats between Haiyan and Jiaxing, which is particularly inconvenient for transportation. Now, local merchants and residents are preparing to open an express boat service between Jiaxing and Haiyan, carrying passengers and goods, making round trips on the same day. This has been approved by the authorities and is scheduled to begin its maiden voyage on New Year's Day.

### Abundant Iron Ore in Anshan, Southern Manchuria; Extremely Convenient for Mining

Changchun, 28th (Havas News Agency) - The Manchuria Daily recently published an article discussing the issue of developing Anshan into an industrial center, stating that Anshan is rich in raw materials, making it a central area for steel smelting and casting. Most of the semi-circular area of ten kilometers wide in the district is controlled by the Showa Steel Works, with twelve iron ore locations and a total of 200 million tons of ore reserves. Although the quality is not very good, the ore layer is only a few hundred meters thick, making it extremely easy to mine. Mining explosives are made on-site. There are also three mine shafts 56 kilometers northeast of Anshan, which are being mined by the Showa Steel Works. Not far south of Anshan are the world's largest and finest clay and mica mines, which can be used to manufacture the finest refractory bricks. Although there are no coal mines in the area, coal can be transported from Fushan, Kaiping, and various parts of North China for supply. In addition, steel smelting solution and water can also be obtained nearby. Anshan is located along the South Manchuria Railway, so transportation is not difficult. Furthermore, it is only 300 kilometers from Dalian and only 100 kilometers from Yingkou. A canal will soon be excavated between Yingkou, Anshan, and Shenyang to facilitate transportation. In short, the prosperity of the Anshan area depends on the amount of steel produced, and steel is a major raw material for the Japanese arms industry, which goes without saying.

### New Japanese Shipping Company Established to Facilitate Wartime Transportation

Tokyo, 29th (Domei News Agency) - It was learned today that the shipping department of Mitsui Bussan Kaisha will be dissolved, and a new Mitsui Shipping Company will be established to facilitate wartime transportation. The new company has a capital of 50 million yen and will take over the routine work previously handled by the shipping department of Mitsui Bussan Kaisha. The new company's head office will be located in Tokyo, and branch offices will be established in Yokohama, Kobe, Dalian, Shanghai, Saigon, and Bangkok. According to shipping industry sources, the establishment of the new company will make a significant contribution to the smoother transportation of important materials between Japan and the countries of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere.

### France Arrests Terrorists

### Strike Wave in Bolivia; US Does Not Plan to Interfere

Lisbon, 28th (Havas News Agency) - According to news from the Bolivian capital and Washington, a strike wave has broken out in Bolivia, and all tin mines owned by the United States in the country have been affected. The position of the US Ambassador to Bolivia in the labor dispute has aroused great discussion. US Secretary of State Hull stated at a press conference today that my ambassador has telegraphed me explaining everything. I am very satisfied that he did not attempt to interfere in the Bolivian labor unrest. He inquired about the amendment to the labor law and how it would affect the cost of tin production, but this was a natural action, as the United States is the largest buyer of this important war material.

### War Affects South American Industry; Raw Materials Cannot Be Exported; Machines Cannot Be Imported

Lisbon, 28th (Havas News Agency) - According to news from the capitals of Latin American countries, since the outbreak of the European war, transportation between Latin American countries and Europe has been cut off, resulting in various difficulties for industry. Public utilities in Argentina and Brazil are particularly inconvenient, as various professions in these countries use the metric system commonly used in Europe. However, South American commercial firms are now unable to obtain the necessary parts, and American industry, which adopts the British system, cannot supply South America with the necessary equipment. It will take several years to solve this difficulty. After the United States entered the war, the situation improved slightly, but since the Allies lacked ships and the submarine war expanded to the entire Atlantic Ocean, the situation has worsened again. South American countries are now suffering from the inability to export raw materials, resulting in mountains of coffee stocks in Brazil. In the United States, however, restrictions have been placed on the purchase of coffee. In Latin American countries, imports from the United States have always been dominated by the necessary industrial machinery, such as agricultural implements shipped from the United States to Brazil, which have apparently decreased. According to news from the Brazilian capital, the amount was 3,600 tons last year, but has decreased to 380 tons this year.

### Tragic Train Crash in Canada; Over 100 Casualties

### Overview of Transportation and Economy in North Borneo Over the Past Year

Kuching, 29th (Central News Agency) - Since North Borneo was pacified by the Japanese army, it has assumed an important task in the construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, and its future holds unlimited hope. The following is an introduction to the economic construction situation in North Borneo over the past year.

Transportation

The entire transportation system of Borneo, apart from shipping, is virtually nonexistent. Moreover, due to the shallow coastline, the water volume of each estuary is very shallow, making navigation by larger ships virtually impossible. Before the war, there were 5 million tons of ships traveling along the coast. Since the outbreak of the war, coastal shipping has been completely cut off. Through the efforts of the Japanese authorities, 2 million tons of ships have resumed shipping. Roads are also quite scarce, and there are plans to modify or construct roads from Jesselton to Sandakan and from Borneo to Miri. In addition, in view of the importance of Sandakan, there are plans to make the port more perfect. Ships of 20,000 tons can now dock on their own, and it is expected that the port will become the central cemetery of North Borneo in the future.

Agriculture

North Borneo is rich in fruits, among which jackfruit is famous for its delicious taste all over the world, and sold well all over the world before the war. In the future, it is planned to set up canning factories in Changdi to revitalize it. Other crops such as corn, pepper, and other agricultural crops cannot be planted in the coastal area, so they will be planted after disposing of the dense forests in the inland area. The authorities believe that this measure can both harvest primitive forests and increase production, so they are vigorously encouraging it. As for the cultivation of rubber, it is now in a state of suspension, because rubber, like Philippine sugar, is an overproduced product in the East Asia exchange.

Underground Resources

Among the important resources in North Borneo, the most abundant is petroleum, and its future is promising. The current output is equivalent to that before the war. Other minerals such as iron, coal, gold, climbing ore, and mercury are also very abundant, and mercury is the most abundant, and is known as the first in the world, with a monthly output of several tons. The purpose of coal development is to supply the local needs of the south. Although the mineral resources of Borneo have not yet been investigated, the reserves are extremely abundant, and the future is truly immeasurable.

Macau Correspondence

### The Life of Soldiers in the Interior

In October, the Guilin Ta Kung Pao published an editorial entitled "How to Repay the Soldiers at the Front," which aroused discontent and anger among the soldiers. Consider the following two examples:

First

I have a deep feeling hidden in my mind that I have long wanted to say but have not revealed. Seeing the Ta Kung Pao editorial "How to Repay the Soldiers at the Front," it unexpectedly revealed my deep feeling, and I felt very happy at the time. I would like to express my most sincere gratitude in the form of a share of the six million soldiers.

I am a student youth who continued to study in a high school in Hunan Province. Since the outbreak of the war, I voluntarily abandoned school life and joined the battlefield service work. Before long, I joined the × unit. From then on, I officially lived the life of a soldier. The treatment of our army is not as good as that of European and American countries because the national economy is not well-off. In the past two years, because of soaring prices, the lives of soldiers have been really hard.

In the past few years, the call for "military first, victory first" has spread to every corner of the country. During this long-term war, in principle, the country should use all its strength and wealth as possible in the military aspect. Considering the current treatment of soldiers, in today's national financial difficulties, we thousands of millions of comrades-in-arms naturally have no extravagant hopes for clothing and daily necessities. Just in terms of life, the current food for soldiers in general units is 24 taels per day for staple food (military rice) and 13 yuan per month for non-staple food, averaging 4 jiao and 3 fen per person per day. In today's expensive prices, may I ask: How much is left after buying firewood for 4 jiao and 3 fen per person? Just take rice as an example. Twenty-four taels of market rice per day (including hemp bags and transportation losses) can only be burned into a little more than three bowls of rice. It is enough for people in peacetime and the wealthy, but soldiers are either lying in trenches fighting all day or operating. How can we talk about nutrition if we rely on these two meals of six bowls a day?

Second

I am a soldier of the ×× unit. Because I saw the Ta Kung Pao editorial "How to Repay the Soldiers at the Front," everything described was the truth, which really touched my soul. It is exactly what I want to say in my heart. Indeed, the appeals of civil servants and the appeals of school teachers are all done by people, but few people care about the living conditions of our soldiers. We will not mention the past, and at the same time, we only hope that we can maintain the minimum standard of living. Now, our monthly salary of more than ten yuan is really too hard! When it comes to eating, there is no talk of vegetables. The only thing to eat with rice is a small bowl of boiled cabbage.

### Class A Retail Oil Shops Reopen Today; Total Allocation of 10,300 Loads; Must Be Sold Out in Four Days, Ending January 3rd

The supply of edible oil in this port is expected to ease as batches of oil from Dalian arrive in Shanghai and soybeans are also loaded, which are pressed into soybean oil by oil presses for delivery. The bottom line is getting thicker day by day, so the panic can be eliminated. Yesterday was the last day of the four-day sales period for Group B. Starting today (30th), Class A oil shops will continue to sell oil for four days. Except for New Year's Day when sales will be suspended, sales will be available until 5:00 pm on January 3rd, not until January 5th. The details are recorded as follows:

Nature and Types of Retail Oil Shops

A total of 1,840 retail shops in the two concessions and Nanshi, Shanghai West, Zhabei, and Pudong have registered with the edible oil wholesale office to receive edible oil allocations. These retail edible oil shops can be divided into the following categories: 124 shops specializing in edible oil, 36 sauce shops, and 1,680 distilleries. The first of these registered edible oil retail shops all hang a price list of edible oil set by the edible oil wholesale office.

Still Sold in Two Groups, A and B

The above-mentioned types of edible oil retail shops have been divided into Class A for those with daily sales of more than one load and Class B for those with less than one load. Since the 22nd of this month, Class A and B have been selling edible oil for four days each. Yesterday was the last day of sale for Group B. Today is the start of the continuous sales period for Class A oil shops. Each person can still buy one catty of soybean oil in sequence according to the numbering method. The sales time is still from 9:00 am to 5:00 pm. Each catty is still sold for 7 yuan and 1 jiao including the donation.

Class A Continues Selling Until the 3rd

The total allocation of oil for Class A oil shops this time is 10,300 loads, which is equivalent to the amount available for ten days of door-to-door sales in the past. Now it is sold out in just four days in order to be universal. Therefore, Class A retail shops will be open from today, except for New Year's Day when they will be closed, and will be open until 5:00 pm on January 3rd. Group B retail shops are also expected to continue for four days until 5:00 pm on the 7th.

Source of Edible Oil on the Market This Time

The edible oil sold today is all soybean oil pressed from the soybeans recently loaded in Shanghai by local Shanghai pressing plants. The Group B retail edible oil allocated for the next period will generally still be supplied with barrel oil loaded in Dalian. At the same time, several joint guarantors in the two concessions will try to adopt a household-by-household oil supply system for the edible oil sold by retail shops in the area, and purchase oil with the oil purchase certificates issued by the general joint guarantor in order to reduce the suffering of squeezing and waiting. The amount of oil purchased specified in the oil purchase certificate is not uniform in each district. The Class A oil shops sold today will still follow the spleen number announced in the above decision, rotating in turn.

He expressed his sincere gratitude for the cooperation of the press in various aspects, especially their wholehearted assistance in promoting Sino-Japanese friendship. He will never forget the friendship and assistance he received in Shanghai when he goes to the front line in Manchuria to take up his new post. Dr. Laiyi, the manager of the De Wu Hao Wai Noon News, gave a reply on behalf of the reporters, expressing his deep regret for Lieutenant Colonel Yokoyama's departure from Shanghai and wishing him a smooth journey.

Yesterday afternoon, he invited representatives from the Shanghai West gentry and business circles to discuss the promotion of committee affairs at the International Hotel. Fifty to sixty people from all walks of life attended. First, Bu reported on the significance of organizing the Winter Relief Committee, saying that providing relief to refugees is directly related to saving human lives, indirectly reducing the risk of living in poverty, and increasing social security. Winter relief donations are not limited to targets. One point of relief will be carried out for every point donated. I hope that all walks of life will contribute more. Then Zhang Deqin and others expressed their opinions. Finally, the attendees made on-the-spot donations, which were quite enthusiastic. It is also heard that the committee will first handle matters such as providing clothing and porridge from today.

### Shipboard Warfare - A Dialogue

Naval Shipbuilding Vice-Admiral - Kiyoshi Nagamura

Former Principal of Tokyo Higher Mercantile Marine School - Kunihiko Sugawa

Asahi Weekly Reporter

Translated from Asahi Weekly, December 27th (To be continued)

Japan's Ships Are Japan's Treasures

Sugawa: I believe we can confidently say that Japan's merchant ships are the best in the world. There's a perfect example. A long time ago, Osaka Shosen Kaisha had a ship called 〇〇 Maru, an excellent passenger ship of the 10,000-ton class. Unfortunately, that ship collided in the Pacific Ocean with a 10,000-ton cargo ship called 〇〇 Maru, belonging to the International Steamship Company. The bow of the cargo ship pierced the side of the passenger ship, creating a large hole in the engine room, and water rushed in. However, although the engine room was filled with water, no water penetrated any other part of the ship. This fact shows how tightly and leak-proof the ship was built. As for the cargo ship, only the bow was dented, with no major damage. At that time, lifeboats were lowered in the Pacific Ocean to transport all the passengers from the passenger ship to the cargo ship, which then towed the passenger ship back to Japan, thus saving it.

Nagamura: Indeed! This isn't just a triumph of shipbuilding; the quality of the crew also deserves praise!

Sugawa: Exactly. If it were a foreign ship, they might have abandoned the passenger ship. But Japanese sailors regard their ships as Japan's treasures and refused to let it sink, so they towed it back. Tugging was, of course, very difficult, and being towed was no easier! Because towing a 10,000-ton ship with another 10,000-ton ship, what would happen in bad weather, if a storm arose? The consequences are unimaginable. Yet at that time, laborers, sailors, cooks, and stokers, everyone united, worked together, and took on this difficult task. Although there are such examples in foreign countries, cases where people become neurotic, give up on themselves, and even engage in mutual slaughter on a ship where the future is uncertain, are too numerous to mention. However, Japanese ships can maintain perfect order, working together from beginning to end, all the way back to Japan. Here, I believe, we can prove the excellence of Japanese sailors and the robustness of ship construction.

Naval warfare has become common knowledge. Ships can be built desperately, and in a relatively short time, but to make them move, a large number of crew members is indispensable. If those crew members don't each possess a steadfast spirit, they cannot serve diligently. Therefore, the ship problem and the crew problem have both become the most critical issues at present. In today's situation, I believe that the problem of ships and the problem of sailors especially cannot but be fundamentally considered. There are many strategies for dealing with a long-term war, but I hope everyone recognizes the role ships play for Japan in a long-term war, and also understands that ships cannot move on their own; it is the sailors who make them move. Imbue the ship with the strong spiritual power of the sailors, and then Japan's ships will have a great role.

Gratitude for the Sailors

Reporter: So, what should the people in the rear hope for from the sailors?

Sugawa: I hope that the Japanese people will more fully understand that the current war is a war of transportation. Today, everyone knows that trucks are very useful, both inland and on the battlefield. They also know how important railway transport is. So, let's talk about the transport capacity of ships. Take, for example, a merchant ship that can carry 10,000 tons of cargo; such a merchant ship is not a very large ship. But to load 10,000 tons of cargo, if using trucks with a load capacity of two tons, it would take no less than five thousand trucks. If using trucks with a load capacity of ten tons, it would also take one thousand trucks. If forty trucks are connected to form a train, then it would take twenty-five trains to load 10,000 tons of cargo. This is the power of ships. I regard the role of ships in war as the same as each sailor answering the call to serve in the military and contributing their abilities. Whether passenger ships or cargo ships, in peacetime, they each serve society according to their performance. In wartime, they are called up, and if they are excellent passenger ships, or fast cargo ships, they become like warships, and can also be used as warships. Even fishing boats, along with the army's operations, have various uses during enemy landings. In short, no matter what kind of ship, regardless of its size, it is useful in war. It is not correct for people to think that useful ships must be excellent ships. Any ship is useful.

During the last European War, the German "Seeadler," which roamed the Atlantic and Indian Oceans and was known as the "Sea Devil," had a ship captain who commanded a sailing ship. He installed a motor on that sailing ship for auxiliary power and performed many amazing feats.

So, I believe that the people must truly recognize that ships are something that determine the fate of a country. In war, they have a significant mission; at the same time, there must also be a correct understanding of sailors. Therefore, when the people eat their three meals a day, if their rice is mixed with foreign rice, they must know that the foreign rice was brought by sailors risking their lives from Annam, Thailand, or Yangon, breaking through the enemy's guerrilla warfare network. Therefore, we cannot but be grateful for the contributions of ships. Otherwise, we would be ashamed to be a maritime nation. If there is a lot of foreign rice mixed in the rice, that is a sign of abundant food and safe ship navigation. But ships do not only transport foreign rice; they also carry all the materials necessary for war, so we should especially be happy if a lot of foreign rice is brought in.

Eliminating Sailors' Worries

I hope that the people will all have such a correct understanding, and show even more sympathy for sailors. Furthermore, we should consider methods of protection and relief. Germany and Italy both do this. In addition, countries like Europe and America also have considerable protection and relief measures for those who have served at sea for decades, and for the children and families of those who have died at sea. Therefore, sailors often leave port laughing, with no worries about the future. I believe that such measures are truly necessary. Because in this way, promising young people will be willing to go to sea and serve the country. Therefore, both the country and the people must diligently consider how to encourage outstanding young people to compete to go to sea and serve. I believe this is absolutely necessary for a long-term war.

Nagamura: This is indeed important.

Sugawa: During the Russo-Japanese War, I read something written by Puriboy, the paymaster of the Varyag. He became a prisoner after surrendering and was transferred to the warship "Asahi." According to what he wrote, "From the waters off Ulsan to Maizuru, I was very surprised. On the 'Asahi,' I could see combat drills being conducted at night. The Russian fleet had been completely annihilated, yet Japan was still conducting combat drills. From this, I realized the reason for Japan's victory? I couldn't help but stick out my tongue." That was their spirit!

Reporter: Thank you. (End of translation)

### Who Plans for the People's Food? - Unified Purchase of Grain in Producing Areas - Division of Areas and Prohibition of Free Competitive Purchase - Adopt Allocation System Based on Actual Needs

After the authorities of the two concessions implemented a system of rationing food based on population for Shanghai residents, they recently decided to find ways to appropriately increase the allocation of rice flour to ensure sufficient food supply for the residents. It is reported that starting from the 22nd period, in addition to allocating half a shēng of white rice per person, the amount of flour will be increased from one and a half jins to two jins. A reporter from Commercial News recently learned from rice industry sources that the authorities, in light of the good harvests in rice-producing areas of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui this year, with production exceeding previous years, have divided the producing areas into fourteen special zones to control the purchase of rice and grains. It is stipulated that merchants are prohibited from freely bidding; the authorized agencies will uniformly purchase the rice, and the rice obtained will be allocated to various places to maintain the people's food supply. Regarding Shanghai's food supply, after overall planning, it will be allocated to the Rice and Grain Management Office based on actual needs, and then distributed to designated rice shops for rationing. It is reported that a large amount has already been transported from the producing areas to Shanghai and stored in warehouses such as Taikoo and Zhejiang, so Shanghai's food supply can be guaranteed for the long term.

### Talk by Watari, Commissioner of Police - Strengthening the Police Force

(Domei News Agency, Shanghai) Watari, Commissioner of Police of the Public Concession, stated yesterday while hosting news reporters that the Municipal Council is carrying out a plan to strengthen the police system in the second year of the Greater East Asia War. Preparations have been completed to enhance the effectiveness of police officers, especially Chinese police officers, and to expand the Japanese police officer section. The maintenance of security in the Public Concession depends on the cooperation between the police authorities and the Baojia self-defense corps, which has already shown remarkable success. Since the beginning of the year, efforts have been made to improve the Baojia system, and the progress made is largely due to the enthusiastic assistance of Chinese residents. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the police station has been reorganized four times. The fourth reform implemented the exclusive use of Japanese in official documents, thereby eliminating the former British and American influence in the police station.

### Shanghai Clearance Association Plans to Compile "Shanghai Clearance Documents"

The first phase of Shanghai's clearance has been underway for four months. In order to record the actual situation of the clearance, the Shanghai Clearance Association has decided to compile "Clearance Documents" and has designated the association's secretariat to be responsible for the design, with the assistance of the propaganda department. A meeting of various units was convened on the 26th to decide to organize an editorial committee to handle the matter centrally. Yesterday (the 29th) at 2:00 PM, the editorial committee was formally established and held its first meeting, chaired by Zhang, the director of the secretariat. After reporting on the purpose of the meeting, discussions began on printing costs, classification principles, and other points, and decisions were made on all of them. It is expected that the manuscript will be completed by mid-February, the compilation and printing will be completed by early March, and publication will be in mid-March.

### Opening of Jingmei Cafe - Yi He Helps Education

Jingmei Cafe on Nanjing Road opened the other day, and friends and relatives competed to send flower baskets to congratulate. The owner of the cafe, Mr. Ling Jianming, considered the flower baskets to be a waste and requested that they be converted into cash to donate to the newspaper's scholarship fund, hoping to arouse public sympathy and encourage everyone to follow suit to promote education. His enthusiasm for helping education is admirable. The list of donations in lieu of congratulatory gifts is listed below: Chen Longquan 40 yuan, Zhu Ruiqing, Zhao Zhiyan, Lu Zhigang, Li Linsen, Wu Yuling, Huang Dazhong 30 yuan each, Huang Heting, Lv Baofu, Huang Zongqi, Wang Zhibo, Pan Shuxian, Tang Tongsūn 15 yuan each, Qian Mujiao 1 yuan, totaling 331 yuan, with a balance of 100,911.12 yuan.

### Unregistered Radios - Re-register with the Management Office

The deadline for the registration of wireless radios announced by the French Concession authorities on the 24th of this month has expired. The office set up at 7333 Route Ghisi has also been closed since yesterday. As for those who possess prohibited radios and have not yet registered, it is reported that they must go to the Wireless Radio Management Office at 316 Hardoon Building, Nanjing Road, before the 31st of this month to complete the registration.

### Ren Ci Charity Association Distributes Congee in Zhabei

The Ren Ci Charity Association of Gaoshou Lane, Haining Road, is organizing winter relief. In addition to distributing winter clothing and general congee tickets in the central district, it will continue to set up a congee kitchen at Zhijiang Temple, Song Park Road, Zhabei, starting on the 12th of this month. More than a thousand nearby poor people register with the association daily to receive congee.

### Poverty Relief Fund Movement

A letter from Shanghai Guangyi Shantang states that the organization's charitable activities, such as providing clothing and medical treatment, are based on the principles of charity and morality. However, in these troubled times, human hearts are in danger, and it is indeed not easy to secretly help the poor. Although the organization's funds are limited, it spares no effort to serve society. The clothing tickets sent have already been distributed to those in dire need. This letter expresses gratitude. Also, Mr. Cheng De kindly donated 200 yuan, leaving a balance of 5,537 yuan.

### Car Thief Captured

Yesterday at 7:00 PM, the French Concession police received a tip that a large group of bicycle thieves were hiding at 71 Xiaohuwei, Hongqiao Road, West Shanghai. They immediately dispatched detectives to the address and arrested six people on the spot: Lü Wenyong, Zhou Desheng, Lu Xueyu, Ding Aqi, Qu Guibao, and Zhu Jinrong. They were taken to the police station. According to their confession, they had stolen four bicycles, which had been sold to 99 Tongren Street, Xujiahui, 77 Belle Road, 253 Rue de Monvel, and 169 Xinjiang Road, Zhabei. The detectives went to those addresses to retrieve the bicycles and brought the buyers to the police station for further investigation.

### Apprentice Falls While Lowering Rice

Rong Dade, a 22-year-old from Guangdong, was an apprentice at Fulong Cloth Shop at 348 Jiangxi Road, fourth floor. Yesterday afternoon, the shop bought about 40 jins of rice. The apprentice used a rope to lower it from the fourth floor, but when he lowered it to the second floor, the apprentice could no longer hold on and fell from the fourth floor together with the rice, suffering serious injuries and in critical condition.

### Lost Boy Waiting to Be Claimed

On the 22nd of this month at 8:00 PM, a lost boy was found at the intersection of Rue Massenet and Zhengjia Bridge. He has a round face, is about five years old, and is wearing a blue cloth long shirt. He was taken to the Lukiawan police station by the Chinese police and has been kept there for ten days. No family members have come to claim him. It is said that the child has a delicate face and does not look like he comes from a poor family. Lately, he has been crying day and night, calling for his mother. The police authorities hope that those who have lost a child will come to claim him.

### Lost Watch

To whom it may concern, I, Xu Zaikang, boarded a streetcar on Rue Cardinal Foch this morning (the 29th) before 11:00 AM to go to the Bund. When getting off the car at the New World stop, I found a square gold-cased watch with an old leather strap left on the car. I handed it over to ticket seller "1031" to be turned in to the streetcar company for claiming. Please publicize this so that the loser can know where to retrieve it. Sincerely, Xu Zaikang, December 29th.

### Anti-British and American Association Requests the Municipal Council to Completely Eliminate the British and American Character of the Concession

(Central News Agency) The Shanghai Chinese National Anti-British and American Association previously obtained the support of hundreds of well-known figures in Shanghai, including Yuan Lüdeng, and jointly petitioned the Municipal Council to demand the complete elimination of the British and American character of the Shanghai Concession. Yesterday (the 29th) at 10:00 AM, they visited various bureaus of the Municipal Council to submit the petition. The association also plans to continue to make the same request to the Japanese Army and Navy authorities. The gist of the petition is that since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the British and American forces that have been fostered in East Asia for many years have been instantly eliminated. This is a great achievement of the brave Japanese soldiers, but even today, a year after the war, the Shanghai Public Concession still has roads named after British and Americans, and there are still monuments and bronze statues commemorating British and Americans. We firmly believe that the fundamental elimination of these symbols of hostile and aggressive forces to erase the shame of the citizens of Shanghai is also a way to eliminate obstacles to the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. The Chinese National Anti-British and American Association hereby suggests to your bureau that you consider the interests of the citizens of Shanghai and expedite the realization of this goal. We sincerely hope so.

### Gold Jewelry Exchange Rate Drops Below 3,000 Yuan Mark

Yesterday, the listed price for gold jewelry at Shanghai gold shops was first listed at 100 yuan higher, at 2,950 yuan per liang (purchase price reduced by 300 yuan or more). There were still few transactions among the industry, and it had retreated to within 2,700 yuan. On that day, it sold at 2,730 yuan, dropping to 2,670 yuan, more than 100 yuan lower than the 5th, with a price increase of 60 yuan. Transactions were sparse. As for silver jewelry, each liang still showed 16 yuan. Transactions among the industry were further reduced to 16.5 yuan. Yesterday morning, the Shanghai Money Exchange further reduced interest rates by one point, suspending 1.7 jiao.

### Tianjin-Shanghai Exchange Rate Drops - Federal Currency Falls Another 2 Jiao

Yesterday, the exchange price for military tickets among the industry was stable, between 5.5535 yuan. Small money houses and bank door prices were 5.56 yuan and 5.545 yuan, respectively. The Joint Reserve Bank notes fell sharply again by 2 jiao, with buying and selling prices at 3.6 yuan and 3.7 jiao, respectively. This is due to the decline in the Tianjin-Shanghai exchange rate.

### Mixed Performance of Chinese Stocks

Yesterday, the Shanghai stock market still had a few trades done secretly among the industry, but the transaction was sparse. From the close today, the annual holiday will also be processed, and trading will be suspended. The situation is still in the sell-off of seeking real goods, but those with capital choose to absorb the better ones. The World Book Company and the Five Continents Pharmacy are quite strong. Public utilities are the weakest, and department store stocks and new drug stocks are also mostly sluggish. The unofficial dark market price is actually controlled by those who are still in business, and the commission is pressed after accepting the commission of the households. Therefore, the stock prices of each stock market are mixed up and down in chaos. The highest and lowest market prices for trading are listed below:

### Tax Increase Imminent - Piece Goods Optimistic

Yesterday, due to the imminent tax increase on yarn and cloth, the cloth market was more popular, and the shouting price was slightly higher, but there were very few sales, because the industry was optimistic. 12-pound Dapeng fine cloth was sold for over 197.5 yuan, and it continued to be good for 1.5 yuan. The factory price of 12-pound Earth fine cloth opened in the morning at 196 yuan, and there was no supply in the afternoon. Peach Lady Lin rose to 322 yuan, and Chickens also needed 321.5 yuan. Dongpi Four Gentlemen Serge red list has risen from 8.1 yuan to 8.2 yuan, an increase of 1 jiao.

### Woolen Industry Busy with Inventory

Woolen sales were negligible due to the end of the year, except for a few odds and ends for urgent needs. However, since the abolition of small transportation, large transportation orders have not been issued, and there is no way to transport and deliver them, which is also a reason. Many businesses in the industry are inspecting their inventories and closing their accounts to calculate their profits and losses for the whole year. The association is busy finding the income tax from last month's micro-collection. There are many fewer peddlers and brokers in the market than in the past. Observing that the price of goods is still very firm, and the air of spring and summer goods is even tighter, this is because the bottom of the woolen goods is gradually lacking.

### Yangzhou New Peanuts on the Market

Price per bag is 500 yuan

Yesterday, the miscellaneous grain market was quite soft, because the National New Year is approaching, and both the firms are preparing to close their accounts, so there were not many transactions. The market is still trending firm due to the insufficient supply. Yangzhou peanuts and peanut kernels were shipped to Shanghai in the first batch. The price of peanut kernels was 735 yuan, and 100 bags were traded. 20 bags of peanuts were sold at a price of 500 yuan. 50 bags of Chongming sandy red beans were sold at a price of 343 yuan to 345 yuan. Another 560 bags of sandy soybeans were sold at a price of 330 yuan to 338 yuan. One cart of Yuanlong cakes was sold at a price of 83.75 yuan, and 50 sheets of Fei Zi cake were sold at a price of 84.5 yuan.

### Longkou Vermicelli - Winter Sales Still Good

Longkou vermicelli has been trending steady recently, with good winter sales. The opening price of new Longkou vermicelli was 1,1780 yuan, the upper range of old goods was 1,100 yuan, and the next range was 1,050 yuan. The current market price for new goods is 1,200 yuan, which has not yet been traded.

### Yantai Shrimp Tails - Source Continuous

Yantai shrimp tails are arriving continuously, and sales are also quite lively. The current market price for large golden hooks is 5,000 yuan, medium hooks are 4,500 yuan, and small hooks are 3,700 yuan, which are hot and stable.

### British and American Cigarettes - Sales Active

Selling prices rise again, Japanese cigarettes remain stable

In the cigarette market, British and American goods are actively selling for domestic consumption, in preparation for the New Year's door sales, which has led to a general price support from cargo owners, so prices have risen. However, Japanese and domestic cigarettes remain stable. The price of British cigarettes is 9,450 yuan for Brand 9, 8,450 yuan for Old Knife Brand, 7,700 yuan for Pin Hai Brand, 6,200 yuan for Wu Hua, and 7,400 yuan for Fairy Brand. The price of Japanese cigarettes is 2,850 yuan for Gold Gun Brand, 3,300 yuan for Golden Building, 2,700 yuan for Red Rose, 2,950 yuan for Quanlu Brand, and 2,400 yuan for Guide Brand. The price of domestic cigarettes is 6,350 yuan for Pyramid, 5,600 yuan for Beauty Brand, and 3,700 yuan for Golden Mouse Brand, which are more or less stable compared to the previous day's prices.

### Soap and Candles Scarce - Selling Prices Rise Repeatedly

Matches Rationed, Market Remains Mediocre

There are very few transactions for soap, and it is quite difficult to sell in large quantities. Handlers see that the inventory is scarce and are waiting and watching, resulting in a market with prices but no transactions. If there is a transaction, the price is determined by the number of buyers. The current price is 510 yuan per box for Gu Ben soap, 480 yuan for Bai Xiangmao soap, 415 yuan for Huang Xiangmao soap, and Scissors soap.

Match transactions are generally not very active among囤户 (Túnhù; Speculators, or hoarding households), and the actual sales market is generally sufficient because the rations are sufficient, so there are few transactions among the industry. The price of Phoenix Brand is still 3,000 yuan, Beauty Brand is 3,200 yuan, Golden Tripod Brand is 2,800 yuan, and Miscellaneous Brand is 2,350 yuan.

Candles are becoming increasingly scarce, so it is difficult to buy both odds and ends and whole boxes. Those who have a little inventory are becoming increasingly scarce, and the shouting price is rising step by step. The price of White Lee's Ship Brand is 420 yuan, the Price of clown hat brand is 360 yuan, Eagle Brand is 400 yuan, and Miscellaneous Brand is 250 yuan.

### Lackluster Tea Sales

Since the holiday ended on the 25th, the tea market has seen some trading activity. However, only about 20 dan of red and green tea were traded throughout the city. These were purchased by Ding Jintai Tea House, including approximately 13 dan of red tea priced at 640 yuan. The remaining 7 dan were green tea, sold by Maoji Tea Shop for 550 yuan.

### Bagua Dan Sales Still Active

Volatile Price Fluctuations

In the medicine market, items like Bagua Dan are still selling steadily, but the prices fluctuate quite a bit. Other transactions are sporadic, and prices generally seem stable. Headache powder is priced at 7 yuan, Wan Jin Oil at 31.5 yuan, Bagua Dan at 6 yuan, Partridge Vegetable at 56.5 yuan, Longhu Rendan at 2.5 yuan, and Invincible Tooth Powder at 11.5 yuan.

### Sympathy

— Mingyue

On a public vehicle, a passenger said to another passenger that he was walking on the road last night, the weather was very cold, and he saw a beggar stripping the clothes off a dying beggar and putting them on himself. The passenger said with great emotion: "People who are utterly impoverished must have numb nerves and no sympathy at all."

After hearing this, a tragic scene of a beggar stripping clothes appeared in my mind like a newsreel.

Yes, in the eyes of "gentlemen," this scene will inevitably provoke a complaint, saying: If they could have saved and spent less and deposited more money in the bank, how could they have become beggars? These two beggars must be lazy and not striving. They deserve it! They deserve it!

The social situation is very complex, especially in this unprecedented era of great upheaval. There are many reasons for becoming a beggar, and the tragic history experienced cannot be fully explained in a few words. Let's not delve into that. The question that lingers in my mind is: "Do people who are utterly impoverished have no sympathy at all?"

Mencius said: "The heart of compassion is inherent in everyone." Benjamin Franklin said: "The poor are more generous than the rich."

My guess is that the beggar stripping the clothes off the dying beggar was actually an extremely cowardly act. (Indeed, this act is terrible.) Because stripping the clothes of a passerby would lead to legal trouble, while stripping the clothes of a dying beggar would not be subject to any interference. This is a tragic history of human hell and probably has nothing to do with sympathy.

Generally, unscrupulous merchants and speculators hoard and manipulate goods, raising prices sky-high. A small number of them have indeed become millionaires. However, many people who could have avoided becoming beggars are now overwhelmed by high prices and reduced to beggary. The few who become rich through unscrupulous means indulge in extravagant pleasures. If they were willing to exploit or waste just one percent or one-thousandth less, they could save many lives. However, they would rather spend thousands of gold pieces on entertainment and pleasure than show even a little sympathy. So, where is the sympathy of the rich?

"Being rich" and "being benevolent" are by no means neighbors. A few clever rich people occasionally perform small acts of kindness, but these are just means to "become rich" and gain fame. From a purely moral standpoint, they are already questionable. However, this is already too much to expect from the rich!

### Supplement to Street Anecdotes

— Gao Xiufu

On December 28th, Mr. Ren Yin refuted Mr. Baihong's street anecdote of the 23rd regarding the location of Lu Xun's tomb. The research is thorough and admirable. Furthermore, Mr. Baihong mentioned road names in Shanghai. Besides Zhu Bao San Road and Yu Qiaqing Road, only Lin Gui Road is named after a Chinese person. This is indeed true. As far as I know, there is another road whose Chinese name is often overlooked, namely Shanzhong Road. According to Tao Ruzeng, whose courtesy name was Shanzhong, a native of Gujia Road in Chuansha County on the left bank of the Huangpu River, he was involved in horse breeding. During the Xianfeng and Tongzhi periods, he established a horse carriage company. The business was very prosperous. He acquired a lot of real estate in that area. Mr. Tao was also enthusiastic about charity and made many contributions to public welfare in the local area and his hometown. The French Concession Public Works Department named the road after him. This is detailed in the Chuansha County Annals.

### Organizing Small Loans for Common People

— Han Rui

Currently, except for a few wealthy people, everyone feels that life is difficult. It's like living in a city of sorrow, living each day as it comes. In particular, unemployed common people are the most affected, some of whom have been laid off due to the closure of companies and shops; others have been squeezed out amidst cost-cutting measures. They have no power to find a place to stay; they have no money to do business and make money. Under these circumstances, unemployed common people are the most miserable.

Can we remain indifferent to the suffering of these unemployed common people? No, we should, in the spirit of human "mutual assistance," provide them with possible assistance. I hope that wealthy people in society will take on this urgent and meaningful task of helping unemployed common people.

There are two ways to help unemployed common people: one is to organize employment agencies, and the other is to provide small loans. The former is already being done by the Industrial and Social Affairs Department of the Public Works Bureau through its employment agency for unemployed skilled workers. The latter was previously done by the News Society's small loan program. Recently, Jin Yuan Qianzhuang in Ruyi Lane on Henan Road has also started providing small loans for common people.

Besides helping people find jobs, I believe that the best way to solve unemployment is indeed to organize small loans for common people. This is significant for three reasons: (1) Many common people who have lost their jobs are discouraged and disoriented. Under economic pressure, they are forced to take risks or commit suicide, which has a significant impact on social security. Loans give them a path of hope and strengthen the confidence of the unemployed. (2) Giving a few coins to pitiful people on the street may stem from compassion, but it may also lead them to become self-abandoning and rely solely on others for help, fostering a habit of dependence. Loans can enable common people to be self-reliant and inspire them to become self-sufficient. (3) If unemployed common people can use the borrowed funds wisely and earn some profit, they may be able to resolve part or all of their family's financial burden.

As far as I know, since Jin Yuan Qianzhuang announced the availability of small loans, applications have been quite enthusiastic. The first batch of investigations has been completed, and disbursements will be made soon. I urge wealthy individuals throughout Shanghai to follow suit, expand the scope of the program, and enable many unemployed common people wandering the streets to escape the suffering of hunger and cold and have the opportunity to support themselves.

### Sharing the Same Boat in the Storm

— He Jia Zhi

One or Two: Back Garden Flowers

Wei Cheng lived in the mill. The wound had healed, all the way until the Lantern Festival, when Madam Li Youxie found out. So she urged Wei Cheng to go back. Wei Cheng thought that living to this point, there was simply no right way to go, except to go back and reflect behind closed doors. There was no other proper way. On a bright moonlit night, Li Youxie sent someone to send Wei Cheng back. The second wife Ye was both surprised and happy, as was Cui Zhen. They asked where Huang Long was. Wei Cheng said, "Aunt, being outside, it was like a spring dream. Now the dream has woken up. From now on, I will always close the door and not think about anything. Please forgive me, Aunt. Don't ask me those things I said when I was reckless, and don't ask me the things I don't want to answer." The second wife Ye saw that Wei Cheng looked okay and didn't pursue the matter further. Every day, she made some delicious dishes for him to eat. When people came to see Wei Cheng, she only said that he had gone to Suzhou to study and was not at home. Wei Cheng always kept the door of Shuangmei Study closed. He would kneel for a long time in front of the portraits of his father, Lord Aitang, and his mother, Lady Li, muttering to himself, often for half an hour or an hour without standing up. From the New Year to late spring, from late spring to high summer, the big trees surrounding Shide Hall were green and lush again. He

During this time, things improved. Fei Changhe hadn't come to the Ye family to harass Xiao Qing for a long time. Neither the second wife Ye nor Cui Zhen had any illnesses. And those whom Wei Cheng had been concerned about in the past, like his only confidant Huang Long, and Chen Yourong's children, Guoqi and Guofang, who were avenging his father's death, had no news. In the blink of an eye, it was early August in the Western calendar. Wei Cheng had been living at home, isolated and ignorant, for more than half a year, and he was extremely bored and frustrated. He couldn't help but feel the urge to move. He had returned on a bright moonlit night, and now he wanted to take advantage of the moonlight to go for a stroll. He locked the door and walked away, only to hear a burst of soft music. Someone was singing the song "Back Garden Flowers," followed by loud laughter. He was afraid that his family would notice, so he rushed back home with a sad mood. Sure enough, A Xing had already gone to the back to ask, "Who opened the door and went out?" Wei Cheng hurriedly responded, "It's me, A Xing. In the village ahead, someone is singing. Who are they?" A Xing said, "Young master doesn't know. Someone is putting on a dance troupe, preparing to go to Shanghai to make money." Wei Cheng sighed deeply. (257)

### Gleanings from Tibetan Politics

— Baihong

Tibet has always been known as a secret country and has long been coveted by the British. Its western and southern regions border India, and British-controlled Bhutan and Nepal. Its northern and eastern regions are adjacent to Xinjiang, Qinghai, and Xikang. With the situation in West Asia tense and India becoming an important international player, neighboring Tibet will naturally be given more attention. My friend, Mr. Wu, who previously worked for the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission for many years, is familiar with Tibetan affairs and has repeatedly sent me sporadic letters. I am now presenting them to readers for their enjoyment.

(1) Starting with the Panchen Lama and the Dalai Lama:

Panchen and Dalai are originally titles of respect for the Dharma King by the Tibetans, and not personal names (both the Panchen Lama and the Dalai Lama have their own real names, as will be detailed later). Both are great disciples of the Yellow Sect founder Tsongkhapa, and their mantle is passed down through generations. The Dalai Lama resides in the Potala Palace in Lhasa, Tibet, and has been passed down to the thirteenth generation. The Panchen Lama resides in the Tashilhunpo Monastery in Shigatse, Tibet, and has been passed down to the ninth generation. Dalai originally means "ocean" in Mongolian, symbolizing that blessings and wisdom are as vast as the ocean. In Tibetan, it also means the ruler with the highest power. Panchen is an abbreviation of the Sanskrit word "Pandita," a respectful term for scholars, meaning learned and capable, vast and unparalleled. The Dalai Lama's position is naturally higher than that of the Panchen Lama.

(2) A Review of the Separation and Combination of Politics and Religion:

According to Tibetan history, before the Yongle period of the Ming Dynasty, it was originally the era of the Red Sect. Politics and religion were separate. Political power was governed by the king, while religious power was held by the Dharma King. After Tsongkhapa initiated the religious revolution and spread the Yellow Sect and passed away, he left a will to his two great disciples, the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Lama, who would reincarnate in future lives. At that time, the first Dalai Lama, Gendun Drup, was the son of the king. He abandoned the throne, became a monk, and received the precepts. Therefore, he had a dual qualification. He was both the Dharma King and the Tibetan King. This was the beginning of the unification of politics and religion. However, there were often separations and combinations thereafter, largely depending on the talent and ability of each Dalai Lama.

(3) The Actual Political Organization

The highest administrative organ in Tibet is the "Kashag," which translates directly to "Administrative Hall." Its nature is similar to the cabinet of a cabinet system, composed of four "Kalons," who are responsible for all legislative, judicial, and administrative powers in Tibet. They carry out the Dalai Lama's orders and exercise power through a collegial system. "Kalon" translates to "high-ranking political officer," and their nature is similar to that of ministers in a cabinet system. There are typically three secular officials and one monk. They organize meetings and exercise all political power. The method of their selection is that they are appointed by the Dalai Lama, without a fixed term. Between the Dalai Lama and the Kalons, there is also a "Silon," which translates to "Political Minister." Its nature is to connect the top and bottom. However, it has no power to change the decisions of the Kashag. It assists the Dalai Lama in handling administrative affairs on a daily basis, similar to the prime minister in a cabinet system. This position is usually filled by a secular person. The method of its selection originally required the election of major Hutuktus (a respectful term for lamas, also called Living Buddhas). Recently, it has been changed to be appointed by the Dalai Lama and is often a relative of his family.

(4) The Former Dalai Lama and the Former Panchen Lama

The Dalai Lama has been passed down to the thirteenth generation, and the Panchen Lama has also been passed down to the ninth generation. The thirteenth Dalai Lama's name was "Ngawang Lobsang Thupten Gyatso," and he reincarnated in the second year of the Guangxu reign of the Qing Dynasty. When British troops entered Tibet in the past, he fled to the interior and once came to Beijing. He was quite capable. Later, he dismissed the Tibetan King "Dingjie Delinmu" and appointed his cousin "Yaoqi Lengqing" as the Silon. All political, military, and religious powers in Tibet were under his control. He passed away in Tibet in 1933.

The ninth Panchen Lama's name was "Losang Chökyi Gyaltsen," and he reincarnated in the ninth year of the Guangxu reign of the Qing Dynasty. Because of his discord with the Dalai Lama, he left Tibet for the interior in 1924. Later, he was recruited by the National Government, and in 1934, he was appointed as a member of the National Government and the Pacification Commissioner of the Western Border. He resided in Beijing, Nanjing, and Shanghai. Later, he went west to Inner Mongolia and Qinghai. In the winter of 1937, he also passed away from illness in the Yushu residence in Qinghai.

(5) The Current Acting Ruler, Jize Rezhen:

In Tibetan, "Jize" means "acting ruler." Rezhen is a personal name. It is customary in Tibet that after the death of an old Dalai Lama, before a new Dalai Lama is reincarnated, the people elect a wise and capable Hutuktu to act as his representative. Rezhen was elected to be the acting ruler after the thirteenth Dalai Lama passed away. He is from Qinghai, has talent and courage. In the summer of 1939, he dismissed Silon Yaoqi Lengqing. He is currently the highest authority in Tibet.

(6) The Young Dalai Lama and the Young Panchen Lama

According to custom, after the death of an old Dalai Lama, people should be sent to search for a reincarnation. Lots should be drawn to decide. However, the thirteenth Dalai Lama passed away in 1933, and it was not until February 22, 1940, that the enthronement ceremony was held in Lhasa. The Chongqing government sent Wu Zhongxin, chairman of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission, to attend. The fourteenth Dalai Lama's name is "Lhamo Dhondrub," and he was six years old at the time. He was born in Qijiachuan, Gongbeng, Xining, Qinghai. Two of his brothers are young Living Buddhas in the Kumbum Monastery. At the same time, a reincarnation was also found in Biru, one of the thirty-nine tribes of Xikang, and another in Menzhuling, Shannan, Tibet. However, because Rezhen's divination, sea gazing, and the instructions of the Dharma protector all matched Lhamo Dhondrub, and he was recognized by a joint assembly of monks and laypeople as the reincarnation of the thirteenth Dalai Lama, the lottery procedure was not held. The Chongqing government also confirmed this with a clear order.

As for the tenth Panchen Lama, according to news from Kangding last year, the Panchen Lama's residence in Ganzi sent people to search for the reincarnation. They had already divided into two routes, north and south, to investigate. In early July, they found a reincarnation in Zhuosang, Lihua County, named "Loten Dorje." He is a resident of Zheduotang in Kangding and was born on November 2nd of the old lunar calendar of 1938. He has been welcomed to Zhousang Hui La Temple. The outcome is still unknown. In fact, the Panchen Lama's situation in Tibet is nothing more than a symbolic offering.
