### The Early Stage of the Coral Sea Battle Concludes; Both Sides are Reorganizing Their Forces; World War II is Brewing

Geneva, Switzerland, 10th (Allied News Agency) - According to a London dispatch, a complete report on the Coral Sea battle has not yet been received. What is known is that the first phase of the battle has ended, and both sides are reorganizing their forces. While the British and American sides have spread news of a great victory, responsible officials in London say that the declared results of the battle have not yet been definitively confirmed. Furthermore, according to a special dispatch from the Swiss Daily in London, the British and American claims of victory are still uncertain, and a second major battle is expected.

Tokyo, 11th (Haitong News Agency) - A spokesperson for the Japanese Information Bureau declared that the Coral Sea naval battle has now concluded and that the details of the naval battle released by the British and American sides do not conform to the facts.

Melbourne, 11th (Reuters) - A communiqu√© on the results of the Coral Sea battle will be released by Washington, D.C., at which time the losses on both sides may be announced simultaneously.

Rome, 10th (Havas) - Mussolini's mouthpiece, Gayda, recently published an article in "Italian Daily", which he edits, praising the Japanese Navy, stating in brief that the Japanese Navy achieved a triumphant victory in the Coral Sea battle. This was not only due to the bravery of the Japanese forces but also to the extreme dispersion of the enemy's forces. The British and American countries must simultaneously deal with the German and Italian navies in the Mediterranean, the North Sea, and the Atlantic, and therefore cannot concentrate their forces against Japan. Conversely, the armies of the Axis powers are cooperating very well.

Lisbon, 9th (Allied News Agency) - According to a Melbourne dispatch, the commander of the Allied forces in the Southwest Pacific has just announced that Japanese planes again bombed Port Moresby continuously on the 9th.

The American and Filipino Forces in Mindanao Surrender

Philippine Front, 11th (Allied News Agency) - Major General Sharp, the commander-in-chief of the American and Filipino forces in Mindanao Island, acting on the orders of Lieutenant General Wainwright, the commander-in-chief of the American forces in the Philippines, surrendered unconditionally to the Japanese forces at 9 p.m. last night. Prior to this, Colonel Kellersberger of the U.S. Army went to the American front lines in Malaybalay, Mindanao Island, on Saturday afternoon on behalf of General Wainwright and reiterated General Wainwright's surrender order, which had been sent by wireless radio. General Sharp then visited the local Japanese army commander and surrendered unconditionally.

Davao, Mindanao Island, 10th (Allied News Agency) - The enemy forces used the natural terrain southeast of Davao to build many fortifications and resisted stubbornly, but they could not withstand the fierce attacks of the Japanese army and began to collapse on the 9th, abandoning many weapons along the way. Colonel Kilen, the chief of staff of the American and Filipino forces in Mindanao Island, was captured.

Manila, 10th (Allied News Agency) - The Japanese army units operating in Mindanao are sweeping through the scorching hot Cotabato Plain, progressing steadily and achieving great results. According to aerial reconnaissance by the army, the reinforcements moving north from the east coast of Mindanao Island are attacking enemy forces who are stubbornly resisting by taking advantage of the mountainous terrain. At 4 p.m. on the 9th, they broke into the enemy stronghold upstream of the Pulangi River east of the Cotabato Plain and occupied Gamu, taking control of the area.

Manila, 10th (Allied News Agency) - After the Japanese army repelled the American forces in the northwestern mountainous area of Mindanao Island on the morning of the 9th, a certain army unit is still closely pursuing the remnants of the enemy. At 3 p.m. on the 9th, it crossed southeast of Kadingilan and occupied Wessmith, a vital American position about 35 kilometers north of Malaybalay. Another unit pursued the remnants of the enemy and also captured the right flank of Malaybalay. The Japanese forces, which had departed from Kadingilan on the 8th, crossed the 2,300-meter-high Mount Kitanglad and launched a fierce attack on the American forces. On the morning of the 9th, they occupied Miaray, west of Malaybalay, and continued their fierce attack behind the American lines.

### New Delhi Announces: The Burmese Government Moves to India; Lord Linlithgow Issues Orders; Emergency Defense of Indian Provinces

New Delhi, 11th (Reuters) - According to an announcement last night, Sir Reginald Dorman-Smith, the Governor of Burma, has been ordered by the British government to move to India. The ministers have already arrived in India ahead of him. This relocation of the Burmese government is due to the limited scope of the areas outside the military zone that remain under the jurisdiction of the administrative authorities.

Tokyo, 11th (Allied News Agency) - According to the Asahi Shimbun, a dispatch from the Burmese front reports that Japanese planes attacked British military installations 250 kilometers northwest of Chittagong yesterday, with great success. The British troops withdrawing from Mandalay are now concentrated there. All Japanese planes returned safely to their bases.

Tokyo, 11th (Allied News Agency) - According to a Lisbon dispatch, the Viceroy of India, Lord Linlithgow, has taken urgent measures to defend India, issuing orders to all Indian provinces on the 8th, stating that each province should, under the supervision of the governor, follow the command of the defense commander, appoint responsible persons in each village, and jointly bear the responsibility of defense, so that all villages in India become defense cell organizations. However, with the Indian people increasingly distancing themselves from the British, it is questionable what concrete effect this kind of defense organization order can have, and it is feared that it is merely a paper tiger.

Saigon, 11th (Haitong News Agency) - Gandhi wrote in his "Harijan" magazine that the British remaining in India is tantamount to inviting Japan to invade India. Therefore, once the British army withdraws from India, Japan will have no reason to attack India. It is reported that a British person wrote to Gandhi, saying that the withdrawal of the British army from India would be tantamount to surrendering to Japan. Therefore, Gandhi wrote this article in response.

Tokyo, 11th (Allied News Agency) - The Japanese Army Air Force flew to Chittagong, a key point on the coast of the Bay of Bengal in eastern India, on the 8th and 9th, and carried out its first air raid, inflicting heavy damage on the airfield there and achieving remarkable results. In addition, Japanese army units have already swept through the whole of Burma, so India's situation is already very critical.

Rangoon, 10th (Allied News Agency) - According to Indians who recently arrived in Bhamo from Toungoo and recounted their refugee situation, when Japanese troops entered Rangoon, they tried to cross the Arakan Mountains to seek refuge in Assam. While the oxcarts were en route, the British Indian Army had already retreated after them. These British Indian troops were extremely exhausted and fell into great confusion due to Japanese bombing, acting on their own and collapsing into disarray. Moreover, that area is a dry area of Burma, and drinking water is extremely scarce. Plague was rampant in the army, and several soldiers were dying every day. Furthermore, because the road connecting directly to Assam in India had not yet been completed, they abandoned the steamships and fled on foot.

### Chari Establishes United Front; Resolves Hindu-Muslim Dispute

Madras, 11th (Reuters) - Former Premier of Madras Province, Chari, recently told reporters that the leaders of the National Congress should now consider the interests of one party as secondary and the safety of the country as paramount. A united front must be established, and a genuine national government must be established to mobilize the people of the whole country to jointly assume the important task of national defense. The dispute between the National Congress and the Muslim League should be resolved as soon as possible so that the country can be spared the calamity of peril.

Lisbon, 11th (Haitong News Agency) - Peruvian President Dr. Prado told reporters in Washington yesterday that the Japanese residents in Peru do not pose a threat to Peru or other countries in South America.

The government will use domestically produced rubber to set up factories for manufacturing.

### Bulgaria to Open Special Parliament; Establish Embassy in Japan

### Churchill Declares: Will Attack Germany with All Might; Planes and Tanks are Being Shipped to the Soviet Union Continuously; Will Retaliate with Poison Gas If Germany Uses It

London, 10th (Havas) - Today is the second anniversary of Churchill's premiership. The Prime Minister delivered a broadcast speech to the nation, stressing that the United Kingdom and the United States are determined to attack Germany with all their might. The original text included: "The aerial bombing campaign against Germany by the air forces of the United Kingdom and the United States will almost certainly be a major feature of this year's war. The purpose of this bombing campaign is to attack the German heartland, which is still an important base for Germany's offensive against the Soviet Union. At the same time, the United Kingdom and the United States will ship large numbers of tanks, aircraft, and artillery to the Soviet Union continuously. If the German army uses poison gas in the Eastern Front to harm the Soviet military and civilians, the United Kingdom will definitely retaliate, using the same weapons to strike German military targets without hesitation. However, we must solemnly declare that unless Germany uses this hateful weapon first, we will never initiate it. But we have to prepare everything to take large-scale retaliatory action when necessary. The British people and their ally, the Soviet Union, have never worked so closely together as they do today. In the future, we will spare no sacrifice to work for the common struggle between the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union. Recalling the beginning of my premiership, unfortunately, successive events occurred, and the Allied forces suffered repeated setbacks, which was quite disappointing. Even the threat of aggression once approached our national borders. At that time, the Mediterranean had been closed, and our shipping could not pass through the Mediterranean and had to go around the Cape of Good Hope in Africa. Fortunately, Prime Minister Smuts of the Union of South Africa has always been our steadfast ally there. However, this route is long and far away, so everyone thought that our last days were coming, and even our best friends thought so. The same was true of the African war at that time. The British army had repeatedly suffered defeats in Abyssinia, but in the end, it turned defeat into victory. In short, what we should do now is to strive for final victory with an indomitable spirit. We are no longer without military equipment, nor are we isolated and helpless. We have powerful allies to support us. All the Allied nations have solemn beliefs and common interests and are determined to support us. As for our air fleets bombing Germany, it has started with the bombing of L√ºbeck and Rostock. For the sake of the Germans, when we bomb the above-mentioned cities, the residents had better evacuate to a distance to overlook its destruction. As for the Eastern Front, everyone knows that a major war is about to occur. We are waiting for a terrible storm to occur in that area, but there is no sign of when it will break out, nor is there any news to allow us to make a judgment. Today is May 10th. Airplanes and ammunition are still being exported by sea as usual. Whether the Allied forces intend to open a second front is not appropriate to disclose at this time. As for the Madagascar incident, we decided it as far back as three months ago. This "precautionary measure" will ensure that the heroic French nation can restore its inherent position in the world, but Madagascar Island will be temporarily managed by us. Finally, regarding the Pacific War, we acknowledge that the Japanese army has repeatedly achieved success in the Far East."

### Fierce Fighting on Several Eastern European Fronts

Headquarters of the German Leader, 11th (Haitong News Agency) - According to this morning's German military report, Soviet troops in Eastern Europe launched several attacks on our lines, with fierce fighting lasting for a long time, but they were eventually repelled. Soviet troops in Lapland have been routed. When German planes scouted the Black Sea, they sank a merchant ship (1,300 tons) in the Kerch Strait. The Soviet army on the northern front suffered heavy losses. German fighter planes shot down 27 Soviet planes, including 22 Hurricane-type aircraft. We only lost one plane. German fighter planes and dive bombers bombed the port of Murmansk and a large merchant ship on the railway, which was hit and damaged.

Berlin, 10th (Havas) - Military sources announced that the German army had achieved great success in operations on the Eastern Front last week. The details are as follows: In the Donets region, there were only minor contacts between the two sides. The Soviet army repeatedly attacked us under the cover of artillery and tanks, but they were all repelled by the German and Romanian allied forces. Our air force bombed Soviet airfields, transportation lines, troop concentration points, as well as Sevastopol, the Kerch Peninsula, and various parts of the Caucasus. On the central front, the German army also made important progress. 15,000 Soviet soldiers, and 600 others, were captured by us. There was fierce fighting on the northern front because our Sch√∂rner's unit had been surrounded by Soviet troops for three days. Recently, with the help of our air force, they carried out a fierce breakthrough and have made contact with our forces. Our air force continued to operate despite the rain and lightning. The Soviet army has had 14 tanks destroyed by our forces, 150 machine guns, and thousands of soldiers bombed to death. On the Murmansk front in the Lapland region, German and Finnish allied forces, regardless of the muddy roads, launched an offensive and annihilated a Soviet unit. Three Soviet merchant ships in the Arctic Ocean, totaling 19,000 tons, were also sunk by our planes. Another large freighter was heavily damaged. In addition, German forces are carrying out mopping-up operations in the rear. Since April, a certain unit of our army has killed more than 7,000 Soviet guerrillas.

### The Soviet Union Establishes New Tank Factory

Moscow, 11th (Reuters) - Soviet Deputy Commissar for the Tank Industry, Goreglyria, wrote in yesterday's Pravda that a new tank manufacturing industry has been established in the central region of the Soviet Union, and its ability to produce tanks is several times greater than it was six months ago. The large factories that were evacuated from the war zone now have far greater production capacity than before the evacuation.

### North African War News

Cairo, 11th (Reuters) - This morning's British Middle East Command communiqu√© stated that small units of British forces and Axis patrols exchanged artillery fire in North Africa yesterday, but it soon ceased.

Rome, 10th (Havas) - The German and Italian allied forces recently used aircraft to transport troops to the central area of the North African desert to attack a temporary airfield built by the British army. Local newspapers have all praised this feat. It is reported that this airfield was discovered by reconnaissance planes a few days ago. The German and Italian allied forces immediately dispatched units, transported by transport planes, to the location. As soon as they landed, they destroyed 80 barrels of gasoline and 80 barrels of lubricating oil in the barracks and seized many rifles. At that time, the German and Italian fighter squadrons could not patrol in the air to guard against possible attacks by the British side. As the warehouse was far from the landing site, the German and Italian allied forces went there by motorcycle to destroy it, with great success. After destroying all the British-stored munitions and fuel, they immediately retreated in formation. At that time, British planes, having received reports from nearby secret radio stations, rushed to the scene in an attempt to attack our forces, but they were repelled by the German and Italian fighter planes, and two of them were shot down.

### Romania Holds National Day Military Parade; Prime Minister Antonescu Delivers Speech to Soldiers

Bucharest, 11th (Haitong News Agency) - Yesterday was the National Day of Romania. A grand military parade was held here. In addition to King Michael, Queen Helen, Romanian Prime Minister Marshal Antonescu, Deputy Prime Minister Mihai Antonescu, and other government officials, Marshal Hitler also sent General List to participate in the parade as a representative. The most notable units in the parade were the German-Romanian mixed unit led by one German officer, and the Stuka dive bombers soaring in the sky. Romanian Army Minister General Pantazi announced during the parade that 1,200 graduates of the Army Officers' School had been promoted to the rank of lieutenant. At the same time, he delivered a short speech, stating the necessity of Europe forming a united front to jointly extinguish communism.

Bucharest, 10th (Havas) - Minister of the Interior and Commander-in-Chief of the Second Army, General Antonescu, inspected the troops today on the occasion of National Day and delivered a speech to the soldiers. He stated in brief that when the Soviet Union annexed our country's Bukovina and Bessarabia regions two years ago, our country suffered all kinds of humiliation, which has now been washed away with our blood. In recent years, our country has suffered from poor domestic administration, loss of territory, and all kinds of national humiliation, but in less than a few years, our people have risen again to preserve our right to survival. This act can be seen as ironclad proof that our nation cannot be destroyed and can show that we have an unshakable determination to recover lost territory and protect our glory, so that both our friends and enemies can understand this. Our belief in final victory remains unshaken. In short, if tomorrow's Europe is still unable to be unified and share prosperity, it will inevitably collapse again.

Bucharest, 10th (Havas) - Today, many university students in Cluj, the capital of Outer Transylvania, held demonstrations in the streets, singing patriotic songs and slogans such as "Recover Outer Transylvania."

P√©tain's message was read out, stating that France's current situation is exactly the same as that of Joan of Arc's era. He said, "Joan of Arc saved France from the brink of collapse, and her actions are a mirror for us to heal the current wounds. The key to this is love and faith. Joan of Arc trusted God, the nation, and the king, but her efforts did not take effect immediately because those around her were selfish, self-interested, cowardly, and skeptical. She fought hard to inspire a spirit of perseverance and fortitude. Compatriots, remember Joan of Arc's past, put yourselves in her place, do not listen lightly to foreign propaganda, and preserve French ideas in your hearts. You should follow this as a guiding principle, and if you do, you will see France embark on the road to light again."

### National Public Schools to Enroll Students from Ten Regions

Following yesterday‚Äôs article on enrollment methods, in addition to this school‚Äôs own enrollment, the above methods can also be used. The entrance examination subjects for universities and independent colleges will remain as in previous years. The entrance examination subjects for vocational schools or specialized courses will be determined with reference to the university entrance examination subjects. Private universities and independent colleges' five-year vocational schools (except for art and music) may not admit students with equivalent academic qualifications. Other public and private vocational schools and university specialized courses may admit students with equivalent academic qualifications, limited to one-fifth of the total. Public universities and independent colleges may admit up to 5% of students with equivalent academic qualifications, but must comply with the following two restrictions: Students applying with equivalent academic qualifications must be those who completed two years of high school studies before the summer vacation of the 30th year of the Republic, and due to the war were unable to complete their high school studies and have been self-studying at home, and are limited to those who have submitted transcripts from their original schools and passed the examination. Students from senior vocational schools and normal schools, even if they have completed two years of study before the summer vacation of the 30th year of the Republic, may not apply with equivalent academic qualifications. Each department of the normal colleges may also recommend half of the new students from various provinces and cities, who will then be admitted to the school after re-examination. Students recommended for admission without examination from preparatory classes in various provinces and cities and universities will still be assigned to various colleges and universities without examination by the Ministry of Education in accordance with regulations. The detailed enrollment methods mentioned above have been issued to various schools by the Ministry. Students taking the entrance examinations this year should consider the transportation situation and their personal economic situation, and apply to the schools of their choice nearby, so as to save manpower and resources. If they apply randomly, they should raise their own travel expenses to the school, as the Ministry is unable to bear this huge amount of travel expenses due to the current financial difficulties.

### Martinique Island Issue: U.S. and France in Negotiations Hoover Returns to San Juan; Laval Prepares to Clarify Stance

Washington, November 11th, Havas News Agency ‚Äì Regarding the visit of the U.S. delegation to French Martinique Island, well-informed sources here recently stated that U.S. Representative Admiral Hoover returned to San Juan, Puerto Rico yesterday afternoon from Martinique Island. During Hoover's initial meeting with Admiral Robert, the High Commissioner of the French West Indies, both sides were very sincere. However, he returned to San Juan yesterday afternoon and refused to comment on the trip, only stating that the detailed situation had been reported to the government. It is currently unknown what the attitude of the U.S. government will be if the French authorities on Martinique Island refuse to accept the U.S. suggestions. However, it is understood that the Pan-American Special Committee was established a month ago. The United States believes that if it is necessary to occupy Martinique Island or territories of non-American countries in the Western Hemisphere, it has the authority to control all actions. In 1940, the Pan-American countries passed a resolution at a meeting in Havana, the capital of Cuba, stipulating that if the security of the American Republics requires the occupation of any territory, this special committee may be established.

Vichy, November 10th, Havas News Agency ‚Äì Regarding the future of French Martinique Island, all sectors here are awaiting news from the island and Washington to understand the true purpose of U.S. Navy Vice Admiral Hoover's visit to French West Indies High Commissioner Admiral Robert. Those responsible are refusing to comment on the matter, and well-informed sources are also remaining silent. However, according to reports in the local newspapers, the U.S. suggestions have not yet been formally announced, nor has Admiral Robert's first report to Government Leader Laval been released. It is generally speculated that Prime Minister Laval will explain France's views after collecting various information. In fact, the first diplomatic discussion between the U.S. and France on this issue took place in Vichy, namely, discussions between Prime Minister Laval and U.S. Charg√© d'Affaires in France Duke. Whether French Ambassador to the U.S. Henry simultaneously met with U.S. Undersecretary of State Welles to discuss the matter is unknown to government officials. In any case, France will not be able to state its position for another day or two. According to news received last night, Vice Admiral Hoover made several demands on behalf of the U.S. government when he met with Admiral Robert, the nature of which would be sufficient to change the de jure status of the French territory. However, the current status of the island is the result of mutual assurances provided by the U.S. and French governments in recent months, so there is no need to change course.

Vichy, November 11th, Huitong News Agency ‚Äì A public statement from this city claims that the U.S. delegation visited Martinique Island and French High Commissioner Admiral Robert, making demands to change the island‚Äôs current situation. This demand is based on recent guarantees made by the U.S. and French governments. French government leader Laval has instructed French Ambassador to the U.S. Henry to clarify France's position.

Content of the Four Demands Made by Roosevelt

Lisbon, November 11th, Huitong News Agency ‚Äì According to Washington, if the negotiations between U.S. Representative Hoover and French High Commissioner Robert break down because the French side does not accept President Roosevelt's conditions, the United States will resort to force to occupy the French territories in the Caribbean Sea. President Roosevelt's demands are as follows:

All French territories in the Caribbean Sea must abandon Laval's policy of cooperation with Germany. Freeze French deposits and assets in the Caribbean islands, including gold, totaling approximately US$250 million, which will not be unfrozen until the end of the war. The French fleet stationed in Martinique and Fort-de-France will continue to be recognized as French property, but will not participate in the war and will maintain its independent status from Vichy. French residents on the island who refuse to recognize this agreement are free to return to their country. Since the French territories in the Caribbean Sea are within the U.S. defense zone, they must be administered by the United States, or at least have a guarantee that they will not be annexed by the Axis powers. There are suspicions that the French fortress of Martinique is being used as a base by German submarines, although this has been repeatedly denied by the High Commissioner of Martinique and the Vichy government.

Berlin, November 11th, Reuters ‚Äì The German News Agency reported from Vichy that the United States has made the following demands to the French High Commissioner of Martinique Island: Station troops and impose military control at key points in the French Antilles. All French ships that have been docked at Martinique Island since the French-German armistice must be dismissed, and the French oil tankers on the island must be handed over.

Lisbon, November 11th, Huitong News Agency ‚Äì According to U.S. broadcast news, the United States has dispatched several warships to the Caribbean Sea. It is said that Admiral Hoover is the Commander of the Navy in the Caribbean Sea, while Lieber is the Assistant Director of the European Division of the U.S. State Department.

Vichy Military Officials Hold Long Talks

Vichy, November 11th, Havas News Agency ‚Äì Government Leader Laval held talks with U.S. Charg√© d'Affaires in France Duke today, presumably discussing the Martinique Island issue. It is reported that Prime Minister Laval has issued detailed instructions to Ambassador to the U.S. Henry, instructing him to negotiate with the United States. In addition, Prime Minister Laval also held lengthy talks yesterday afternoon with the Commanders-in-Chief of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, Admiral Darlan, Naval Minister Admiral Auphan, and Army Minister General Bridoux. This discussion was not in the nature of a cabinet meeting. The regular cabinet meeting on Saturday of yesterday was canceled due to insufficient number of cabinet members. It will be held as usual next week.

Vichy, November 11th, Huitong News Agency ‚Äì French Prime Minister Laval held a meeting with his confidants yesterday afternoon at 4 p.m. to discuss the Martinique issue. As of now, the Vichy government has not received a report from Admiral Robert, the High Commissioner of Martinique, regarding the U.S. representatives‚Äô negotiations with the island‚Äôs authorities. Semi-official sources in Vichy stated that the U.S. military occupation of Martinique Island cannot be considered fair under any circumstances.

London, November 11th, Reuters ‚Äì Martinique Island Radio Station broadcast a public statement early this morning, stating that foreign news has criticized in detail the talks that began yesterday between Admiral Robert (French High Commissioner to Martinique Island) and U.S. Admiral Hoover. The High Commissioner (Robert) wishes to state that these criticisms are premature, and listeners should refrain from drawing conclusions about the outcome of the discussions.

### Fighting in Madagascar Has Subsided Several Vichy Officials Flee

### French National Automobiles: 2.27 Million Vehicles, Halted Due to Gasoline Shortage

Clermont-Ferrand, November 11th, Havas News Agency ‚Äì In 1938, France had 2.9 million tons of gasoline reserves, but only 200,000 tons remained after the war. As a result of the fuel shortage, all 2.27 million automobiles in the country have been halted. Currently, efforts have only begun to develop domestic petroleum resources. The northern Pyrenees, especially the Lannemezan plateau, are known for their petroleum reserves, with an oil content of no less than 20%, comparable to the best oil wells in Texas, USA.

### Madagascar (5)

The hot springs of Antsirable are mostly scattered in the highlands near volcanoes. The city is indeed well surrounded by four mountains, becoming the center of the basin. It is also because of its unique abundance of springs that it attracts a group of foreigners from the mainland every year to spend a few months here.

Because the natives here bathe frequently, they appear much cleaner than people in other places. They mostly make a living by raising livestock. In the past, people mostly raised cattle, but recently they have found that raising pigs is more profitable, so they have unanimously changed their approach. In order to be able to sell them for a good price in the future, they spend considerable effort on raising them. At sunset, if you are idle and stroll in front of the natives' homes, you will see the housewives of each family patiently scooping water to bathe the pigs, as if they were taking care of a small child. In addition, they also raise some poultry, such as wild ducks and female turkeys, scattered sparsely in the wilderness.

This area also has countless waterfalls, which look like strips of silver satin from a distance. The waterfalls here may not be as majestic and spectacular as the Zambezi in South Africa, but they still have unlimited charm for tourists. According to the results of experts' investigations, the hydraulic power here is very large, and if it can be used for power generation, it will make a great contribution to agricultural irrigation.

In the shallow pools, there are habitats for aquatic animals. On the crystal-clear mirror-like water surface, you will see groups of eels with brightly colored scales swimming leisurely. The natives have a superstition about this, and they revere it as a sacred and inviolable spirit, just like the Indians worship cattle. They carry large amounts of food and throw it in, and they also silently pray, doing so as if they are doing a perfect act of merit.

The above is just one example that we have briefly mentioned. In fact, Madagascar is nothing less than a microcosm of Africa. All the scenery of Africa can be found here. For example, the east is a place where equatorial plants grow densely, and there are many wild animals living there. This area is sparsely populated, but it is naturally of another kind of value to a hunter. The west is a vast and desolate wilderness, with the atmosphere of the American West. The southern ground is particularly dry, with a desolation like the African desert. In addition, in the central plateau, we can easily find basins similar to those on the African continent.

The people here also add a strange color to a distant traveler, especially the Hova people, who are a nation with a complex mix of characteristics. People generally have an amazing musical talent. In the fields and in the cities, they will naturally sing some tunes, many of which are very pleasant to listen to. Naturally, they have never gone to music school to learn, but strangely, they all seem to understand the mysteries of harmony. The songs they create have beautiful melodies, and the lyrics are mostly lyrical, with a gentle and light style, like a beautiful poem. But you cannot use this to jump to the conclusion that they are an artistic nation. Naturally, their temperament is peaceful and gentle, with a feminine fragility. They seem to never want to quarrel, let alone resort to violence. Generally speaking, they are fervently inclined towards peace, but at the same time, they are skilled commercial talents. Their methods of making profits seem to be on par with those of the Jews. They also love festivals. Throughout the year, festivals take up a considerable number of days. Watching the expression of their cheerful and joyful nature will also infuse some excitement and joy into a distant traveler like you and me!

Conclusion

We have already talked a little about Madagascar, including its geography, history, resources, scenery, etc. We have also mentioned a little. Naturally, this is just a glimpse, and there is much more to introduce, especially about the customs and folklore of this strange country. We may talk about it again when we have the opportunity, but now we have to come to an end for the time being. This land, which has been peaceful for nearly half a century, has to be swept into the vortex again with the impact of this war. It seems that the most exciting parts of this drama have already been performed. The port of Diego Suarez fell within three days of the British landing. Although the defending troops are still resisting, their strength is weak, and it is doubtful whether they can last long. But we cannot deny that the area south of Diego Suarez is a very steep mountainous area, and transportation is inconvenient in this area, with thorny bushes and dangerous terrain, which is conducive to defense and not conducive to attack. Therefore, it will take a price to say that the British army will completely occupy it. But what we are paying attention to is not these. According to Churchill, the preparations for this landing deployment seemed to have been prepared for three months. Therefore, it can be said that Britain must be prepared to carry it out at any cost. The British army will naturally not be satisfied with occupying only a few northern ports as some people have speculated. In addition to its strategic value, the British are certainly not willing to easily abandon this land with abundant resources. Resources such as graphite and agricultural products are not easy to obtain nowadays. But for the French, this must be considered a major stimulus. Just look at the posture of Vichy these days, and you can understand a little. However, in this turbulent situation, Madagascar has long become a coveted target for everyone. Whoever can occupy it first is equivalent to taking the first step in the western Indian Ocean. (End of full text)

### Price Increase for Tramways in the Public Concession Not Yet Confirmed

Difficulties in Opening Traffic to the Pudong District Increase in Business Possible, Difficulty Increasing Vehicles

Rumors have circulated recently that the Public Concession Tramway Company will be increasing fares starting on the 15th of this month. The reporter specifically visited the person in charge of the company to inquire about the details, and the information is recorded below.

Heavy Losses After the War

The Public Concession Tramway Company was founded by British merchants. It has strong capital and flourishing business, with annual profits. It is the largest transportation enterprise in the city. Since the Shanghai War, due to the circumstances, the company‚Äôs streetcars and trolleybuses have either shortened their routes or suspended service altogether, resulting in very large losses.

Price Increase Not Yet Confirmed

According to the person in charge of the company, it is currently rumored outside that the company will be increasing fares starting on the 15th of this month, but the authorities have not confirmed the date. Due to the very large expenses, they cannot be covered, and it is feared that the increase will be implemented soon. The method of the increase is currently being carefully planned. The company must take into account its expenses, but it should also consider the people's needs.

Opening of Traffic Not Yet Considered

The reporter then inquired whether there was truth to the rumor that traffic would be opened between the south bank of the Suzhou Creek and the Hongkou area on the north bank. The response was that the vehicles currently in use in Hongkou are owned by the company, but are borrowed by the Central China Company. The fares are calculated in military currency, which is slightly more expensive than in the concession. The two organizations are different. The company has not yet considered the report that the company‚Äôs vehicles would run in Pudong.

Difficulty Increasing Vehicles

Because there are fewer means of transportation currently, the tramcars are particularly crowded. When asked whether vehicles could be added to benefit the people, it was said that this would be very difficult. Although the car bodies can be manufactured in Shanghai, the chassis are all imported, and the source has been exhausted. It is impossible to consider this for the time being.

Business Still Possible

Regarding the current business situation of the tramway company, it was said that although the income is still high, the expenses have increased by more than ten times. The average daily income is about 70,000 yuan, but the expenditure on employee salaries alone has increased eight or nine times, and materials must be added at any time. The prices of some materials have even skyrocketed dozens of times, so there is no profit to speak of this year. It is not yet possible to predict whether the company will be able to distribute official profits. In short, compared to the past, it is as different as heaven and earth.

Difficulties Opening Traffic Between the Two Concessions

As for the failure to open traffic between the British and French concessions, there are approximately two reasons. Disputes often arise over ticket sales and inspections, and fights even break out from time to time. Without a good solution, it may not be easy to open traffic for the time being.

### The Increasingly Serious Leprosy Problem

According to the person in charge of the China Leprosy Relief Association, there are currently no fewer than 3,000 leprosy patients in the city. Although this statistic is not based on an accurate investigation, it is no more inaccurate than the truth. According to the estimate of Dr. Muir, the world's leprosy authority, the actual number of leprosy cases anywhere can be obtained by multiplying the known number by ten. This is because leprosy patients are resented and rejected by society, and they are reluctant to reveal themselves for treatment unless they can no longer hide it. Apart from the patients who consult the dermatology departments of major hospitals and various doctors, there are currently 115 male, female, and child patients at the temporary leprosy shelter set up by the China Leprosy Relief Association on Route Ghisi, Xuhui District, and more than 100 outpatients at the leprosy clinic set up by the Health Laboratory of the News Institute at 40 Chizhong Road. If we calculate this using Muir's method, the actual number of leprosy patients in Shanghai should be far more than 3,000. (The above two leprosy relief organizations are both run by Chinese people, and all expenses are borne by Chinese people. The report in the Chinese News on the 27th of last month that it was run by Dr. Hochungga was actually a mistranslation from the Western press.) (Leprosy is a dominant infectious disease. With the rapid progress of modern science, the fact that leprosy is a curable disease has become an indisputable fact. However, in order to treat patients, in addition to adequate nutrition, they must continuously receive injections of hydnocarpus oil until they are completely cured. From the perspective of society, it is best to completely isolate leprosy patients, so that they have no possibility of infecting others. Currently, only 115 leprosy patients in Shanghai are isolated, or 3.58% of the total, which is somewhat disappointing. Therefore, the temporary leprosy hospital established by the China Leprosy Relief Association needs to expand its capacity, but this is particularly difficult at a time when living costs are rising and fundraising is not easy.

### Transfer of House Sublease Licenses: Still Few Issued

Since June 1st, those who haven't obtained a house sublease license from the Municipal Council are subject to prosecution. The number of licenses issued daily remains low. According to a report from the Datong News Agency, the number of licenses issued on May 7th was: 28 in the Central District, 124 in the Western District, 18 in the Northern District, and 152 in the Eastern District. On the 8th, the numbers were: 24 in the Central District, 82 in the Western District, 20 in the Northern District, and 111 in the Eastern District. On the 9th: 29 in the Central District, 49 in the Western District, 10 in the Northern District, and 57 in the Eastern District. Yesterday (the 11th): 48 in the Central District, 110 in the Western District, 25 in the Northern District, and 110 in the Eastern District. If the above-mentioned sublease licenses are not obtained before the 15th of this month, and are instead obtained during the half-month period from the 15th to the end of May, an additional extension fee of 5 yuan will be required, totaling 10 yuan. Including the license fee of 9 yuan and the magnetic plate fee of 1 yuan, the total cost will be 20 yuan. From June 1st, those who have not obtained a license will be prosecuted.

### Authorities in Both Concessions Crack Down on Illegal Profiteering from People's Food Supply, Investigating Suspects

According to the English-language "Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury," the Shanghai Municipal Council in the International Settlement has recently launched a campaign to crack down on illegal profiteering by individuals involved in the distribution of food for the population. The French Municipal Council in the French Concession also responded this morning (the 11th) by thoroughly investigating the activities of the Soybean Merchants United Association. According to sources in the French Police Department, some members of the association are suspected of obtaining flour from the French Municipal Council at special prices and reselling it on the black market for personal gain. The investigation is still ongoing, so details are not yet available. However, it is reported that the French Police Department has obtained a list of suspected members.

### Rice Shops in Both Concessions Universally Sell Foreign Rice Yesterday

The Office of the Municipal Council's Rice and Grain Affairs is Considering Implementing Rationing Based on Population. The Office of the Municipal Council's Rice and Grain Affairs had previously approved applications for rice allocation to factories, schools, and hospitals with more than 30 employees or members. However, the applicants had to have their accounts audited by a certified public accountant to verify the accuracy of the reported number of people. Recently, restaurants and larger offices (writing offices, foreign firms, etc.) that provide meals for more than 30 people can also apply for rice allocation. The office has created a separate section to handle applications from these types of food-consuming entities. According to reporters, the Municipal Council's Rice and Grain Management Committee stopped issuing corn flour sales slips yesterday and instead issued foreign rice sales slips. After paying the Office of Rice and Grain Affairs, designated rice shops were allowed to pick up foreign rice at the Taikoo Wharf on the Bund in the French Concession, the Zhejiang Xingye Wharf, and the Huishan (Wharf) Wharf. Therefore, this week, rice shops have stopped selling corn flour and are selling foreign rice instead. As a result, the supply of rice is becoming more widespread. The amount sold will not be overly generous, and the price will not increase significantly. Yesterday, rice shops in both concessions universally sold foreign rice. As for the matter of increasing the number of rice shops under the Rice and Grain Management Committee, it is currently under consideration and will be announced soon. This move will undoubtedly have a significant effect on relieving the current congestion. The Rice and Grain Management Committee of the Municipal Council is also considering the implementation steps for rationing based on population. It may be implemented next month after obtaining the consent of relevant parties.

### Shanghai Municipal Police Closes Seven Roads in the International Settlement, One End Still Allows Normal Passage

To adapt to defense needs, the Shanghai Municipal Police in the International Settlement has implemented the closure of unnecessary road exits. To date, seven locations have been closed: Chongqing Road intersection, Longmen Road intersection, unnamed road near the Race Course Mansion, Yunnan Road intersection along the north side of Avenue Edward VII; Shantou Road intersection, Xiamen Road intersection, and Baker Road intersection along the east side of Yu Qiaqing Road. Although the above-mentioned roads have been closed at one end, the other end and all cross streets can be entered and exited as usual. All closures are permanent. In addition, the southern end of Hubei Road along Avenue Edward VII in the International Settlement and Songjiang Alley, a branch road connecting to Zhejiang Road, were simultaneously barricaded with wooden stakes and barbed wire by the responsible Laozha Patrol House starting yesterday afternoon, permanently cutting off traffic.

### Return Home Permits: Continued Issuance Begins Yesterday, Mixed Processing with Temporary Permits, Various Native Place Associations Will Resume Issuance on Behalf

The Shanghai Municipal Council's Special Return Home Permit Issuance Office and district sub-offices began issuing temporary permits last Friday to allow residents to prove their identity when entering and exiting the Japanese military cordon lines around Shanghai, serving as a substitute for citizen certificates. Yesterday, Monday, the office continued to issue these temporary permits and also resumed issuing special return home permits. There were many applicants.

### Return Home Permits Resume Issuance Yesterday

According to a Datong News Agency reporter, after the cancellation of the travel expense and cattle price subsidy policy for returning home on the 1st of this month, the issuance of return home permits was temporarily suspended due to the need for reprinting. Yesterday, the Municipal Council received the newly printed return home permits and has resumed issuing them. The format of these return home permits is the same as before, except that the back no longer contains the words "half-price for transportation of goods by boat or vehicle." The application procedures are also the same as before. At the same time, the various native place associations that issue return home permits on behalf are being notified separately by the Chinese Evacuation Association to continue issuing them. Therefore, it is expected that the issuance of return home permits will be widely resumed in the next few days.

### Documents Required for Passing the Cordon Line

The issuance of temporary permits is intended to facilitate residents entering and exiting the Japanese military cordon lines around Shanghai. Since the day before yesterday (the 10th), anyone without this permit has been prohibited from passing the cordon line. The cordon line is essentially the boundary between the two concessions, including the Hongkou and western extra-settlement road areas. Along the line, in addition to Japanese sentries checking documents, each wharf on the Bund has also been enclosed with fences or ropes, leaving one entrance and exit, where patrolmen check travel permits and citizen certificates. Those without permits are not allowed to board ships at the wharves or enter the concessions. In the past few days, many people have been blocked near the wharves.

### Extremely Crowded Certificate Issuance Yesterday

As for the Municipal Council's return home permit office yesterday, the number of applicants was extremely crowded. Before 8:00 AM, several thousand people were lined up in rows, waiting in the open space outside the Merchant Corps training grounds, with almost no room to stand. Application for issuance began at 9:00 AM. The application forms and procedures were the same for obtaining either temporary permits or native place association permits, so they could be processed together. People returning to their native place could usually obtain return home permits. Those who intended to return to Shanghai after returning home could apply for temporary permits, but they had to fill in the "destination" section on the application form and add a right thumbprint to the permit. It is estimated that the office issued about seven or eight thousand application forms yesterday. If combined with the number issued by the district sub-offices, the total would be close to ten thousand.

### The Great China United Coal Company Continues to Distribute Coal Dust, Coal Ball Factories Attempting to Raise Prices is Illegal

The city's large and small mechanized coal ball factories have been quoting prices to the two major stockpiles (Yangshupu and Longhua) designated by the Great China United Coal Company since yesterday. Therefore, the various large and small mechanized coal ball factories have successively been able to obtain coal dust. However, this coal dust is limited to only one type, Heller-Gubba. Although the burning power of coal balls made from it is inferior to those made from Hongji coal dust, it can still burn adequately. However, various mechanized coal ball factories are using the excuse of high costs to attempt to raise the price of coal balls, which is illegal. Coal balls are a daily necessity, and their importance is no less than that of rice and grain. Therefore, if prices continue to rise, it will inevitably cause public unrest. It is hoped that the authorities of both concessions will pay attention to this.

### Report on Donations to Shen Bao Scholarship Fund

### A Young Man, Prone to Pleasure-Seeking, Befriends a Prostitute, Eventually Unable to Bear the Burden, Embezzles Funds and Flees, Gets Arrested

Fei Yefei, an employee of the Hengfeng Silk Mill at No. 10 Zhongde Lane, Beijing Road, is usually fond of seeking pleasure. He became acquainted with Yang Nannan, a singer at the Jinling Guide Agency. Several months ago, they suddenly began living together. Because Fei's income was not high, Yang continued her old profession. However, Fei's burden became even heavier from then on, and he continued to squander money without restraint, leading to financial difficulties and heavy debt. The day before yesterday afternoon, he took advantage of an opportunity to steal 10,000 yuan in Japanese military scrip and deserted his job, hiding with Yang at No. 31 Yangchunfang, Taiwan Road. Hengfeng Mill reported this to the General Police Department. Chinese Detective Zhu Wanjun investigated the circumstances and arrested Fei at approximately 8:00 AM yesterday, recovering half of the stolen goods and bringing him to the police station for further investigation to recover the remaining stolen items.

### Gambler Urgently Needed to Relieve Himself, Met a Tragic End

At the Yong'an gambling den located at No. 31 Luxiangyuan Road, Nine Acres, at 3:00 PM the day before yesterday, a man, about 40 years old, wearing short sleeves, was gambling on a stall when he suddenly felt the urgent need to relieve himself. Unable to find a urinal, he went to the corner of the wall inside the back door to urinate. A checker, Mr. Jia, saw this and scolded him. The two then had a quarrel, which escalated into a physical fight. The gambler was punched in the vital part of his lower back and immediately fell to the ground, dying instantly. After learning of this, the bookkeeper in the gambling den ordered the workers to carry the gambler's body out the back door and abandon it by the roadside. At that time, there were many gamblers in the den who saw this and felt indignant. They went outside to spread the news. After receiving a report, local police immediately sent detectives to investigate the circumstances of the assault resulting in death and to investigate the deceased's family for verification.

### Difficulties in Reporting Hurricane Season This Year: Astronomical Observatory

Because the countries at war on the Pacific Islands are not providing weather information.

The Xujiahui Observatory starts collecting hurricane reports from the Pacific Ocean every year on July 1st. During last year's hurricane season, due to the impact of the European war, there was a severe shortage of reports on hurricane tracks from the Pacific Islands. The observatory's hurricane reports were therefore less detailed than in previous years. This year, war has broken out in the Pacific, and the belligerent countries will inevitably cease providing weather reports. Therefore, the observatory will find it even more difficult to report hurricanes this hurricane season. Even as of now, except for the temperature records in this port, other meteorological dynamics have ceased to be published to the outside world.

### Designated Branches for Mailing Large Volumes of Printed Matter

The Shanghai Postal Administration issued a notice stating that due to transportation difficulties, all large volumes of printed matter are now restricted to being mailed only at the Sichuan Road General Administration and the following branch offices. Printed matter mailed by individuals, with no more than two items per mailing, can still be mailed at any branch office without restriction. This notice is being urgently issued to inform the public. The notice includes the following branch offices: Youheng Road Branch, Fujian Road Branch, Gongguan Road Branch, Shujin Road Branch, Tilanqiao Branch, Masnan Road Branch, Carter Road Branch, Jing'an Temple Branch, Dongchang Road Branch, Kangti Road Branch, City Center Branch.

### Detective Masterpieces Republished

The ten pocket-sized editions of the Hawthorn Detective Series written by Cheng Xiaoqing and published by the World Book Company last year, including "The Pearl Necklace," "The Dancer's Return," and "The White-Clothed Monster," were widely popular. They have now been republished and are already available. Also, the seven volumes of the Vance Detective Series translated by Cheng, including "The Sister Flowers" and "Tragedy at Dragon Pool," have been out of print for a long time. They have now been reprinted by the World Book Company and are also all available.

### Stored Western Medicine Suddenly Declared Lost, Four Housemates Burned, Culprit Arrested Yesterday

At 5:25 PM on the 7th of this month, a fire suddenly broke out at No. 6 Taian Lane, North Shaanxi Road, immediately filling the area with thick smoke. The fire was very fierce. Four tenants, Yang Qixiang, Zhang Ruisheng, Hong Meichang, and Mrs. Zhao Li, were all burned by the fire. Firefighters arrived on the scene and extinguished the fire. Afterwards, Liu Zhaonian, the Chinese detective of the responsible Huisi Patrol House, investigated and found that the fire started in the kitchen rented by Han Zhaofa. According to Han, a friend from Wuxi named Dai Xuan-sheng, who worked as a bookkeeper at the China Pharmaceutical Factory at No. 60, Lane 175, Alabaster Road, had previously stored "two barrels of Yituo liquid (Yituo is extremely flammable)" at Han's place. On that day, one barrel suddenly leaked, and Dai went to repair it. He struck it hard with a hammer, causing sparks to fly into the liquid, resulting in an explosion and starting the fire. In addition to sending the injured to the hospital for treatment, the police arrested Dai Xuan-sheng yesterday and detained him at the police station pending further investigation.

### The Youyou Nursery Home Sets Up a Rattan Craft Sales Outlet, Nine Percent Discount at the Beginning of the Opening

The Shanghai Youyou Nursery Home has long been promoting the production of products by refugee children to implement a work-study program, including rattan work and flour milling. Recently, the rattan work section has been further expanded. A retail sales outlet has been established at No. 544 Xinzha Road (west end of Chengdu Road) to facilitate the selection and purchase of goods by people from all walks of life. The outlet opened recently (the 10th). All kinds of rattan ware, large and small, are available, including rattan chairs, rattan beds, children's carriages, bookshelves, rattan shells for thermos bottles, rattan boxes, and rattan baskets. The rattan ware made by the rattan work section of the nursery home is exquisitely crafted and priced low. Major companies and rattan ware merchants purchase from them in bulk. To celebrate the opening of the retail sales outlet, all goods are offered at a 10% discount. Moreover, the prices of all rattan wares are marked at the lowest possible price, ensuring honesty and eliminating the hassle of bargaining. You can obtain exquisite products at low prices, and also support refugee children. This is a triple win. We hope that kind-hearted people in society will jointly promote it.

### Letter

Dear Editor, I recently read a news item in your May 10th issue regarding the resale of inaccurate weighing instruments. The content involved the name of the "Scientific Instrument Museum." After investigation, it was found that No. 484 Beijing Road is a certain glassware store, and the inaccurate weighing instruments were sold by that store. However, that store does not have the signboard or name of the "Scientific Instrument Museum." The report is a misunderstanding. The Scientific Instrument Museum's head office is located at No. 406 Fuzhou Road, Shanghai, with branch offices in various ports. It sells various instruments, with precise quality and a long history, and is trusted by all sectors. I am concerned that the outside world may not be aware of this, and I request that you correct the above. Sincerely, The General Affairs Office of the Scientific Instrument Museum, May 11th.

### Aurora Cup Charity Football Tournament to Conclude This Saturday: Aurora to Battle French Police, Nie Zhongcheng vs. Hongyuan

The Aurora Cup Charity Football Tournament has been progressing smoothly since its opening. Only the final two games remain, scheduled to be held at the school on Luban Road this Saturday (the 16th) at 2:30 PM. The first game will be between Nie Zhongyong and Hongyuan, resolving the Bao Li contest. At 4:15 PM, Aurora will face the French Police. This match is crucial to the championship, and is extremely important. The French Police have been proudly able to overcome the Red Harmony team, boasting a record of four wins in four games. Aurora and the Red Harmony are closely following behind with one loss each. If Aurora can defeat the enemy at that time, it will create a three-way tie, and the Red Harmony will still have a glimmer of hope for winning the championship. Otherwise, the championship will be seized by the French Police. Weekend schedule as follows: Nie Zhongcheng‚ÄîHongyuan 2:30 PM, Aurora‚ÄîFrench Police 4:15 PM.

The training time is from 4:00 PM to 7:00 PM every day. Eight veterans of the sports community have been appointed as instructors: Zeng Rongzhong, Yu Zhenglin, Guan Youwen, Tao Yingjie, Liao Jinhai, Wang Xuewu, Guan Hongda, and Gu Huo.

### Charcoal Automobiles

‚Äî Ding Zuze

How to Transform an Automobile

Charcoal automobiles are gasoline automobiles that have been modified, not automobiles built for burning charcoal. Therefore, they are more inconvenient than using gasoline. I have already discussed this before. Now, let me list several obvious disadvantages: such as, the cost and weight of adding additional components; it takes more than ten minutes to start, involving charcoal, fanning, and lighting by hand; horsepower is reduced, especially when driving on steep slopes and mountain roads; the appearance of the car is not aesthetically pleasing; management is troublesome; the heat from the charcoal stove is oppressive, etc. In terms of trucks, there is the disadvantage of reducing the weight and space for cargo. Therefore, before charcoal automobiles reach perfection, there are many things that need improvement and effort.

When an automobile is converted to use charcoal as fuel, the original engine structure does not need to be changed. It only requires the addition of components that generate charcoal gas (coal gas), as shown in the additional components at the rear of the car in Figure 1. The internal structure is roughly as shown in Figure 2, with the parts generally divided into a gasifier, a cooler, an air filter, and an air regulator. These components are sometimes installed at the rear or under the car, and sometimes installed on both sides of the driver's seat at the front of the car.

The gasifier is used to break charcoal into small pieces about one inch long, place them in the furnace, and light them to burn. When they are glowing red-hot, a colorless coal gas is generated. This gas can be used as a substitute for gasoline. However, the gas produced in the gasifier is very hot and must be introduced into a cooler to reduce its temperature. At the same time, because the gas inevitably contains charcoal dust and ash particles, it will damage the smooth parts inside the cylinder if it is sucked into the cylinder. Therefore, it must be passed through an air filter to remove the ash. Finally, it is passed through an air regulator to mix with an appropriate amount of air before being sucked into the cylinder by the engine for combustion. While the automobile is running, the engine constantly draws in charcoal gas, so the gasifier naturally has ventilation, and the internal charcoal fire is constantly burning. Only when starting the fire and after stopping the car do you need to use manual or electric fans to assist combustion.

There are many types of charcoal gas. If the gasifier has a steam generator, it is called wet type. Otherwise, it is called dry type. In addition, it is further divided into upward suction type, downward suction type, and cross-flow type according to the different ways of drawing in charcoal gas. Each has its advantages and disadvantages. Because it involves specialized technology, I will not go into details.

Much Effort Has Been Devoted in the Past

Charcoal automobiles have appeared in China for more than ten years. At that time, many factories in Shanghai were engaged in retrofitting, such as Tang Zhongming, Xiang Kai, and the Municipal Government Public Works Bureau, all of whom made many efforts for charcoal automobiles. The Ministry of Military Affairs also strongly supported this work for the sake of China's industrial economy and self-sufficiency in military supplies. Our eastern neighbor, Japan, also worked hard to research charcoal automobiles and other alternative fuels due to the difficulty in supplying gasoline. There have been many contributions. I will list the statistical figures of various alternative fuels published in the Japanese Science and Technology Monthly to provide a reference and show comparison.

### Five New Banks Join Local Clearing House

The Hankou Bank's collections and payments are now managed by the Shanghai Banking Association's Reserve Committee. Starting from the first of this month, a scheduled clearing system has been reinstated. Each clearing bank dispatches personnel with checks to the Association before the clearing time to participate in the exchange of negotiable instruments. All checks payable by each bank on that day are taken back to the bank by the clearing personnel for payment processing. Since implementation, the procedures have been simpler than before, and each bank's internal affairs can be completed earlier. Recently, the Association's participating banks have added five members: Da Xin Bank, China Fisheries Bank, Shenzhou Industrial Bank, Datong Bank, and Futong Bank.

A communication from Hankou: The Hankou Banking Association, in a circular dated April 27 to all member banks, stated that it had received a notice from the Japanese Special Services Department, enclosing a copy of the implementation guidelines for the banking business permit system within the French Concession, effective immediately. Remittances, regardless of the amount, require a permit. Receipts exceeding 1,000 military scrip or 5,000 yuan in legal tender also require a permit. Loans to the same person or entities considered the same, exceeding 5,000 military scrip or 20,000 yuan in legal tender, require a permit.

### Gold Sovereign Continues Small Ten Yuan Decline

Yesterday, the discount rate for promissory notes was between 15 and 20 yuan per 1,000 yuan, slightly higher. The Shanghai Bankers' Association's interbank loan rate remained unchanged at one jiao. The premium on Central Reserve Certificates was 0.315 and 0.323 yuan.

### Rice Prices Rise by Two Hundred Thirty Yuan in Two Months

In the space of two months, the price of domestic rice has risen by 230 yuan per shi (unit of dry measure). The rice price on March 11th was still 330 yuan, but now it is not less than 580 yuan. Moreover, the quality of the rice is poor, with a high proportion of ash and sand, and many broken grains, appearing to be moldy rice sold at a premium. However, because foreign rice is difficult to obtain, people are willing to pay high prices to buy inferior rice. Alas!

### Active Trading in Beans Continues

The miscellaneous grains market only traded for half a day in the morning. The market closed in the afternoon due to a meeting of sellers within the miscellaneous grains group.

The bean market continues to show a firm trend, as cargo allocation is still pending. Prices in Muji Street were uniformly raised due to active trading. 50 bags of Chongming sand red beans were sold at 235 yuan delivered, and over 100 bags of sand silkworm beans were sold at 136 to 140 yuan ex-warehouse. 50 bags of Sangyuan yellow beans were sold at 240 yuan, and 10 bags of Pinghu Du beans were sold at 260 yuan.

### Public Bond Trading Is Extremely Quiet

The over-the-counter public bond market was extremely quiet yesterday. Prices were firm and stable. There were no major sell-offs or purchases by large institutions. Most transactions involved lots of 5,000 or 10,000. Transactions of larger amounts were extremely rare. Such a sluggish and quiet situation on a Monday is quite unusual. However, it is unlikely that this situation of inactive selling and buying will last. After a short pause, there will likely be significant fluctuations. Yesterday, Hong Da and Tong Kang sold slightly more. The remaining sellers included Tong Hong, Run De, Jiu Feng, and Xin Ji, who sold slightly. Hu He Ji, Tong Li, and Jiu Fu bought slightly more. The remaining buyers included De Chang, Gong Mao, and Heng Yu, who bought slightly. The market price eventually increased by 0.1 to 0.4 yuan. Approximately 200,000 to 300,000 yuan worth of transactions took place. A summary table is provided below.

### Enthusiastic Investment in Chinese Stocks; Foreign Stocks Firm Up

Foreign stocks firmed up and trading was slightly more active, with a total of 31,600 shares traded. 12,500 shares of Xinhe Spinning Mill were traded, with the price soaring from 15.5 yuan to 17.5 yuan, eventually settling at 17.3 yuan. 2,700 shares of Ewo Spinning Mill rose from 38 yuan to 39.5 yuan. 5,000 shares of China Textile rose from 20 yuan to 22 yuan. 2,000 shares of Wool rose from 11.1 yuan to 15.1 yuan. 8,500 shares of Union Brewery rose from 11.5 yuan to 11.8 yuan. 100 shares of Steel were traded at 20 yuan, 500 shares of Paper at 12 yuan, 1,000 shares of Hui Zhong at 2.1 yuan, 500 shares of China Enterprise at 18 yuan, 500 shares of British Alliance at 29.5 yuan, 200 shares of Kaiping at 680 yuan, 100 shares of Xiang Tai Timber at 36.5 yuan, and 1,000 shares of Galenda at 1.7 yuan. Additionally, the Portuguese Foreign Stock Futures Association has reportedly suspended trading.

There was new investment activity in Chinese stocks, and prices were firm and stable. Wing On Company was at 61.5 yuan, Sincere at 75 yuan, China Underwear rose from 24 yuan to 25 yuan, Sino-French Pharmacy (new) rose from 58.5 yuan to 59 yuan, New Asia (new) at 34.25 yuan, Five Continents at 215 yuan with buyers, New Asia Materials around 21.5 yuan, Nanyang Brothers Tobacco at 50 odd yuan, World Book Company (new) at 72 yuan, China at 117.5 yuan, Commercial Press at 210 yuan, Hongxing Weaving at 197.5 yuan, Wing On Textile at 475 yuan, Zhabei Water and Electricity at 18.25 yuan, China General Edison at 18.5 yuan, and Guanshengyuan at 220 yuan.

### The Price of Dried Mussels Shows Fluctuations

Recent market prices for dried mussels have been fluctuating. Western Chinese dried mussels have shown a slight decrease, with the market price yesterday at 920 yuan. Eastern Chinese dried mussels have increased due to a shortage of supply, currently selling for 2,200 yuan.

### Mint Supply and Inventory Both Scarce

The supply of mint has been limited recently, and inventory is also scarce. This item is one of the herbal medicines, but because the arrival and inventory are both lacking, the price is also not low. Currently, second-cut mint is 200 yuan, and first-cut is 180 yuan. The market outlook is steady and positive.

### New Seedlings from Haikou Branches Are Still Good

The last crop of Haikou branches suffered a poor harvest, and no goods have arrived for a long time. Inventory has also been exhausted. According to reports from the production area, the current condition of new seedlings this year is still flourishing. If conditions are good, the harvest should be decent. However, it is found that this year's foreign fees are extraordinarily high, which will inevitably exceed the original cost several times. Therefore, the declared cost, according to current estimates, must be above 400 yuan.

### White Lead Wire Rises Close to Eight Hundred Yuan

After some activity in the hardware trade, business has been quite continuous. Factories on this street have been making transactions from time to time. However, after a long time, due to the trouble of applying for movement permits, and the long time it takes to issue them after submitting them, small workshops and retail users with urgent needs cannot wait for long, and without movement permits, they cannot transport goods. There is a real sense of being caught in a dilemma, which has invisibly dampened the budding hardware trade. It was found that there were slight transactions in white lead wire yesterday, because the movement permit for this item was issued a few days ago, and it was possible to transport it by car within the concession. New plate and round boat steel plates, etc., had no transactions at all because the movement permit was not approved. Because there are occasional transactions in white lead wire, the industry is optimistic, and the market price has a continued increase trend. Yesterday's selling price was already approaching 800 yuan per dan.

### The Decline in Cigarette Prices is Even More Fierce

Cigarette prices increased successively at the end of February. By the end of March, selling prices had reached unprecedented levels, and sales were unusually strong. The reason was the manipulation of general speculators and hoarders, who spared no effort. As a result, the factory also stopped supplying the goods needed by the industry and promoted them underground to the black market. Those so-called (back door goods) operators didn't know the reason, thought that each goods was indeed scarce, wanted to meet the door sales, and wanted to make a big profit, so they searched in the market, and as a result, the price soared. Recently, the market situation has been quite bad, the selling price has been declining day by day, and it has been falling for more than a month. The export ban is strict, and the supply of goods sold at the original price in this city is relatively smooth. In addition, the mold season is forcing the hoarders to sell, the factory supply is smooth, and the selling price is moving towards the original price. Yesterday, the continued decline was even more severe, because it was said that the factory's price for the Golden Gun brand had been reduced, so the market sentiment continued to be weak. It was found that the selling price had fallen by as much as 1,700 yuan from the highest peak, and so were the other brands. It seems that the time is still vibrating, and the opening price is 9,300 yuan for the Great Britain brand, 7,300 yuan for the Old Knife brand, 5,600 yuan for the Pinhai brand, 5,300 yuan for the Little Fairy brand, and 4,800 yuan for the Five Hua brand. There is no difference. The decline in Japanese cigarettes is severe, the Golden Gun brand is 1,770 yuan, the Golden Building brand is 2,480 yuan, and the All Green brand is 2,480 yuan, a further decrease of 50 yuan to more than 100 yuan compared to the weekend. Daily necessities such as soap are becoming more popular, and yesterday's selling price unanimously rebounded by 5 yuan to 10 yuan.

### Door Bolt and Ship Repair

‚Äî Ba Jiao

One day, I was strolling in the Bund Park with a friend. It was a little past one o'clock in the afternoon, and there were not many tourists in the park. We sat down on a bench facing the Huangpu River. The weather was very good that day, and the gentle spring breeze blowing on our faces made us feel relaxed and languid.

The Huangpu River was in front of us, the turbid water, the front wave hitting the back wave; if I were a poet, I might be inspired by the scenery and write some kind of √ó√ó poem. Fortunately, we are all ordinary people who do business, and we don't have any unspeakable feelings when we see this Huangpu River. What we pay attention to is only the boats coming and going on the river surface.

Besides the small launches and small sampans, the most noticeable are the barges. They were piled high with goods, bag by bag, piece by piece, stacked very neatly and firmly. The workers on the boats were rowing oars and levers, looking very strenuous.

"How much do you think these boats are worth per ship?" my friend asked me.

"It's hard to say, considering that a door bolt now costs twenty yuan worth of wood, I'm afraid‚Ä¶ I'm afraid‚Ä¶" I really couldn't estimate it. Fortunately, we were just chatting casually, not seriously "appraising", so we just let it go.

Three days later, I took a streetcar home in the evening. I stood in the crowd for a while, and fortunately, I got a seat. Being able to find a seat on the streetcar now is like buying a lottery ticket or winning the last prize in the monthly savings club, so I am naturally happy. The two people next to me were very talkative, and all the way through the crowding of people, I heard the following conversation.

"I heard that one of your barges has been repaired again, is that so?"

"Don't mention it. This repair cost me more than 14,000 yuan."

"How can it be so expensive? At the end of last year, didn't you say that repairing four ships only cost more than 20,000 yuan?"

"Think about it, the current price of foreign pine is more than five yuan per foot of savings tickets. One foot is ten inches square, doesn't that add up to seven yuan in legal tender?" "Hmm‚Ä¶ hmm‚Ä¶"

"Ship repairs require tung oil, and the current market price is 36 yuan per catty. Half a soup bowl is only half a soup bowl!" (Shanghainese or Pudong people call rice bowls "soup bowls".)

Okay, okay, I thought that a barge from bow to stern is not less than seven or eight feet long. It costs so much money to repair it. Now if you build one. Doesn't it just‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ I remembered the conversation with my friend in the park by the Huangpu River.

### Hooked

‚Äî Ban Gong

At first, eating cigarettes would give you the hope of getting a diamond ring, and gradually, brushing your teeth with toothpaste would also bring you a small fortune. Then there was eating sugar to redeem lottery tickets, and lottery tickets could be exchanged for US dollar notes. I think the younger brothers and sisters may not have forgotten this. Later, after sitting in a car, you could also get refreshments‚Äîas long as you were in the mood to go to "upscale entertainment."

However, the big giveaways are still the same. Today, when I opened the newspaper, the first page made me startled‚ÄîI should say envious and itchy. The gifts "given to each household" are as follows:

A large box of famous cigarettes, a large bottle of foreign perfume, a large tube of toothpaste, a beautiful handbook, a commemorative teacup,‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ and valuable diamond gifts!

There is actually such a generous boss in the world! Moreover, this is not some sneaky bribe, but to invite you to join a wealth-making group. You just have to lie on a magnificent sofa, in a newly decorated room, pick up the phone, "report the market situation," and get rich immediately! Its convenience and reliability are comparable to those tea rooms and clubs before. You may be able to point out a difference. That is, the "treasure openers" in the tea rooms and clubs were still beautiful girls, while those officials who speak of factory orders and military tickets still lack the "flavor" that Emperor Zhengde appreciated. I say, don't worry, Shanghainese are the smartest, and soon you will hear of "Market Queens" or "Bank Xishi".

If the people who "eat phone meals" are not eliminated, our leg strength when queuing will still have to be trained. It turns out that the new drama of getting rich is being performed too fiercely, and it looks like it will close; but after the closing, I don't know who will be the one to receive those "gifts"!

Five pounds of plain boiled water

Three fen of blue cloth

Two spoons of Dumi

Two teaspoons of raw oil

### Alas, Your Feet!

‚Äî Man Shan

Can the affairs of Duke Huan of Qi and Duke Wen of Jin be heard?

If someone were to ask me this, then even though I am not worthy of being called a master, I can still tell him some stories about Duke Wen of Jin, which don‚Äôt sound too boring.

When Duke Wen of Jin was not yet Duke Wen of Jin - let's call him Prince Chong'erÂêß‚Ä¶was in exile abroad. At that time, there were no ships or airplanes, and it was not a government-funded trip overseas. The hardships of crossing mountains and rivers can be imagined. One day, he couldn't even find anything to eat. Prince Chong'er was so hungry that he could only spit out water. One of his followers, Jie Zitui, cut meat from his own arm to feed the prince. Later, Chong'er's luck finally came, and he got the opportunity to return and become the ruler of Jin.

After becoming the ruler of a country, of course, he had everything to eat. He completely forgot about the meat-cutting incident. Others couldn't stand it, so they presented a painting of dragons and snakes, which reminded him of Jie Zitui. He was really confused and forgot to give him an official title. So he quickly sent someone to look for him, but Jie Zitui didn't care about these things. He accompanied his old mother into the mountains to live in seclusion. Chong'er searched everywhere but couldn't find him, so he came up with a desperate plan, setting fire to the mountain, thinking that he would eventually escape, but the result was not the case. Jie Zitui was burned to death inside.

Duke Wen of Jin, in order to commemorate the meritorious official, specially made the piece of wood he was holding when he died into shoes to wear. Every day when he saw it, he couldn't help but recall the past and sigh:

"Alas, your feet!"

After telling the story, I couldn't help but lower my head to look at my feet. The soles of my shoes were already damaged, but to buy a new pair would cost no less than a hundred yuan. To wear straight tribute cloth shoes, according to the bill published in the newspaper by a certain large shoe store, you wouldn't earn a penny‚Äîbecause it was a bloody cost‚Äîit would still cost 49 yuan and 9 jiao. As a result, I could only sigh at my feet:

"Alas, your feet!"

The difference is that I have never eaten the meat cut from someone else's arm, while Chong'er was already the ruler of a country.

### Riding the Storm Together

‚Äî He Jia Zhi

(V) Reciprocal Reporting

Guo Fang is gone, without a letter, and time flies like an arrow. Unknowingly, it has reached mid-lunar January, and the date of Lady Ye's funeral is getting closer day by day. Uncle Li Youxie from Weicheng and Uncle-in-law Zhou Xingfu came to Shi De Tang every two or three days to discuss the funeral arrangements. According to Wei Cheng, the draft of the eulogy should be sent to the Chinese teacher in Suzhou to ask him to correct it. Li Youxie said: "That's too late. By the time you send it, it will take two or three days on the road; it will take a few days for the teacher to decide whether to start writing; it will take another two or three days to send it back, which is terrible. You still have to wait for it to be printed and sent out; by the time people receive the obituary, it will be past the date of the funeral, which will be a joke. In the text, you write that you are dizzy and confused. It's true, dizzy and confused will say the wrong thing, who will care about you." Wei Cheng was not at ease after all, so he sent the draft of the eulogy to a scholar in the countryside and asked him to point out the flaws. The scholar was an antique. He picked up his pen and randomly changed a few words and returned it to Wei Cheng. Lady Ye thought that it was impossible not to thank the scholar for his divine help, so she sent twenty eggs and a small jar of pickles. But Wei Cheng admitted that he was high-sighted and low-handed. Looking at the article corrected by the scholar, he was not very satisfied, but because of the time, there was no way to be dissatisfied, so he had to pay for printing in a hurry. Li Youxie introduced an accountant, who was prepared to deal with a group of workers during Lady Ye's funeral, to write the cover of the obituary in advance.

The obituary was sent out, and people came to send gifts one after another. Wei Cheng expected that Guo Qi and Guo Fang knew the date of the funeral here. He did not know what Guo Qi and Guo Fang's father's name was, so he did not send the obituary to his siblings. But with only three days left until the funeral, Wei Cheng said to Lady Ye: "The Chen family in Shuangqiao should have sent a gift, why haven't they? "Lady Ye said: "This cannot be forced. As the saying goes: It's better to rely on debt than to rely on human feelings. Maybe Miss Chen will come on the right day. When she comes, it will be good to send her to entertain the female guests." Wei Cheng said: "I was thinking the same thing. Maybe he and his sister will come together. Also, Huang Long hasn't come these days; when he comes, I want to give him a job, chief inspector. He will definitely be able to do his job well." (73)

### School Shop News

‚Äî Jin Xie

In this day and age, who doesn't see money as all-important, and spend all day racking their brains and trying to figure out how to make money? Therefore, even the education world, which is known as a "sacred undertaking," is no exception.

The day before yesterday, the school issued a notice, the wording of which was from the hand of an "intellectual," and of course, it was different from the others. It said, "Due to the depreciation of legal tender, each student of this school should pay a surcharge of ten yuan to supplement funds." This kind of "reason" is too ridiculous.

However, aren't the terms "surcharge" so novel and beautiful, more intelligent than "price increase," "premium," and "small rent"? However, a group of poor teachers and staff seem to be "poor" to the end. It is said that this matter has nothing to do with "salary increase." "The school's finances are tight, and it is a time of emergency, so we hope to work together."

### Price

The price for teaching for one hour is legal tender yuan.

Can sell a box of matches, or Yangchun noodles (small account plus extra)!

Ragged robe pawned for a few coins,

Trembling in front of the rice shop on the street,

Sadly thinking of children crying and wife sobbing,

Completely forgetting the wind and rain tormenting each other.
