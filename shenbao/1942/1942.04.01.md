Unless the Allied nations fully cooperate and understand each other, the war will be difficult to advance smoothly. This committee will maintain close contact with similar organizations established in London.

Lisbon, 31st (Haitong Agency) — According to a Washington announcement yesterday, the Pacific Military Conference has been established. The conference is composed of representatives from Chongqing, the United States, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, and the United Kingdom. The meeting place is in Washington, and the first meeting is scheduled to be held at the White House tomorrow.

### After Britain Proposed its Plan, Indians Carefully Study it; Representatives from Various States and Parties Hold Separate Meetings; Defense Issues Become the Main Key

New Delhi, 31st (Reuters) — Representatives from various Indian states discussed the proposals made by British envoy Cripps yesterday and decided to ask Cripps to further explain certain points before replying. Major Indian parties such as the National Congress and the Muslim League Standing Committee also held separate meetings. Their final attitude can be determined today. The general impression is that the British proposal is a "postdated check," the value of which depends on how the Indian central government is reorganized when it is "cashed." The National Congress and other groups hope that when the Indian central government is reorganized, the position of defense should be assumed by an Indian. However, Cripps has stated that during the war, the British War Cabinet cannot relinquish Indian defense. At most, the Indian side can obtain a position in the Ministry of Defense. The National Congress and other groups are inevitably disappointed by this. However, most members of the National Congress Standing Committee firmly believe that if this thorny issue can be resolved, such as by having Indians participate in and preside over defense, then other shortcomings can be easily overcome, and accepting the entire proposal will not be a major problem. Regarding this matter, the National Congress Standing Committee discussed it for four hours yesterday afternoon and scheduled a continuation of the meeting at 8:00 a.m. today. Judging from the situation of yesterday's meetings of the National Congress and the Muslim League Standing Committee, each party holds a hesitant attitude regarding whether to accept the British proposal.

New Delhi, 31st (Reuters) — Cripps met this morning with Xue Mailai Meier and Sindh Province Premier Ba Shu, representatives of the All-India People's Conference Standing Committee. It is expected that this afternoon Cripps will meet with leaders of vassal states such as Baroda and representatives of Sikh groups. Free Party leaders Sapru and Pulaishate met with Gandhi today and discussed for a long time.

New Delhi, 31st (Reuters) — Cripps stated when he met with reporters this morning, "I hope to obtain a decisive expression from the major ethnic groups today or tomorrow. When I meet with reporters next time (Thursday), I will be able to generally tell you what I intend to do."

Tokyo, 31st (Allied News) — Japanese authorities yesterday criticized the British proposals regarding the Indian issue, stating that Britain's excuse of the war not to immediately grant India a new constitution is another empty promise.

Nehru is the Deciding Figure

New Delhi, 30th (Reuters) — Whether Indians accept the British proposals depends on Nehru at present. Nehru is a friend of Cripps, and the two have held talks. Cripps' success or failure will largely depend on whether he can make a good impression on Nehru. The two hold similar socialist ideals. The two must dine together tonight. Under normal circumstances, Gandhi is the final decision-maker, but his anti-war views make him incompatible with India's war efforts. Therefore, the current final decision depends on other leaders of the National Congress. The Muslim League is currently studying the British proposals from both financial and electoral perspectives and has specifically organized a subcommittee to be responsible for the research.

Mahatma Gandhi's Discussion

New Delhi, 31st (Reuters)

It is reported that when the National Congress Standing Committee reconvened this morning, Gandhi discussed Cripps' proposals.

New Delhi, 30th (Havas Agency) — The Executive Committee of the Indian National Congress met at 2:00 p.m. today to discuss the plan proposed by British envoy Sir Cripps, which lasted for four hours and adjourned at 6:00 p.m. Mahatma Gandhi did not attend today but is scheduled to deliver a speech to the committee within days, elucidating his attitude towards the British plan. At that time, National Congress Chairman Yajiat will also deliver a speech following him. In addition, Progressive Party leader Tesai will also visit Sir Cripps tonight to discuss matters.

Muslim League Advocates Acceptance

Lahore, 30th (Reuters) — Punjab Province Premier Haiyate Khan, "Member of the Muslim League Standing Committee," addressed the Muslim League Committee in the province, stating that the British War Cabinet's proposals are based on the principles of justice and fairness. Any party that refuses them will inevitably risk global public opinion's criticism. Haiyate Khan pointed out that the proposals are sufficient to demonstrate the British government's understanding of the political realities in India. He hopes that the proposals will be accepted by the major Indian parties, namely the National Congress and the Muslim League.

Wang Shijie Presents His Views

Chongqing (Dispatch) — At a reception for foreign reporters on the afternoon of the 31st, Minister of Propaganda Wang Shijie discussed the Indian issue, stating briefly that the British government's plan regarding the Indian issue has been publicly announced by Sir Cripps in recent days. Regardless of our sympathy for the plan, I do not wish to discuss the content of the plan at this time. What I cannot refrain from saying is that China and the Allied nations are no less concerned about the attitude of Indian leaders than Britain is because if Cripps' trip fails, it will affect not only Britain and India. If Cripps and Indian leaders can find a mutually agreeable solution within days, the news will not only encourage the British and Indian people but also encourage people of justice in the world. We are currently encountering the darkest period in our lives, but if 350 million Indian people can obtain freedom purely through negotiations without any bloodshed, then this event will be a bright light in this dark period, and future historians will regard it as an immortal feat produced by human wisdom.

The U.S. Political World Expects Highly

Washington, 30th (Reuters) — Cripps is carrying the British War Cabinet's proposals to India, and political figures here have expressed their approval. They believe that this is consistent with the true spirit of the Atlantic Charter. Britain grants India the status of a self-governing dominion and at the same time makes India a "free companion" in the war. Members of Congress hope that Indian leaders can obtain new strength to continue fighting alongside Britain and the self-governing dominions in this "generous proposal." Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee Blum stated that this is an opportunity for true unity between Britain and India. Both sides should have a spirit of reciprocity. I sincerely hope that both sides recognize the great need for their future interests and hope that India accepts the proposal. Senator Perber stated that I am very pleased with the spirit of the British proposal, but we must know whether India can undertake the test of its national destiny. Indian leaders should consider what is most feasible at present. All peoples should be free. This principle does not only apply to the Anglo-Saxon people.

### Japanese Military Announces Amendments; Restrictions on Foreigners' Passage Modified

(Allied News Agency, This Port Exclusive) The Japanese Consul-General stationed in Shanghai issued special passes to foreigners after December 8th last year to restrict their passage. It is learned that this measure will be abolished from April 10th. The Japanese Shanghai Garrison, Naval Landing Forces, and Shanghai Military Police issued an announcement on April 1st stipulating new restrictions, which will be implemented from the 11th. The heads of the Japanese Army and Navy Information Departments also gave speeches.

Original Text of the Announcement

The special pass system for foreigners currently in force in the Shanghai area will be abolished on April 10th, Showa 17 (Republic of China Year 31 [1942]). From the 11th, it will be implemented in accordance with the following measures: Foreigners passing through the area within the inner line designated on the map, regardless of their nationality, should pass through the sentry posts and, in principle, do not need to show any identification documents. Enemy nationals residing outside the inner line but inside the outer line will be issued residence certificates to allow them to pass within the outer circle and through the area between the outer circle and the inner line. However, they must show the residence certificate when passing through the inner circle sentry posts. Enemy nationals residing within the inner circle are not allowed to go to the outer circle area. However, those who are deemed to have official business or other unavoidable reasons will be issued a special pass indicating the destination, allowing them to pass through the area between the inner and outer lines and in the outer line area. However, they must show the pass when passing through the inner line sentry posts. Those who wish to request the residence certificates and special passes stipulated in Items 3 and 4 should bring a letter of explanation and three photographs from the consul-general of the protecting power and apply in person to the Foreign Affairs Section of the Military Police at the Hamilton House. Nationals of neutral countries (referring to those other than enemy nationals) who need to pass through the area between the outer line and the inner circle (including those residing in the outer circle area) will be issued a certificate for neutral nationals. They must show the certificate when passing through the inner circle sentry posts. Those who wish to apply for the neutral country certificate stipulated in Item 6 should attach three photographs to a certificate from the consul of their country and apply to the Japanese Consul-General. Passage outside the outer circle will still be handled by the Army Foreign Affairs Department and the Naval Attaché Office. The previous special passes must be returned to the Japanese Consul-General by April 20th.

Content of the Speech

The heads of the Japanese Army and Navy Information Departments said that the Japanese military authorities have decided to abolish the special pass system for foreigners issued by the Japanese Consul-General since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War in order to control the passage of foreigners in the Shanghai area, starting from April 10th. The new control system stipulated in the announcement issued on April 1st will be implemented from the 11th. The new system has been formulated taking into consideration the scope permitted in terms of security for foreigners residing in Shanghai, whether they are nationals of neutral countries or enemy countries, and providing the greatest possible convenience for passage. Therefore, foreigners should understand the purpose of the Japanese military authorities, abide by the various items stipulated in this announcement, and earnestly pay attention to avoid violating the regulations, which would affect the relevant officials. The following points should also be noted: The application for identification documents, residence certificates, and special passes will be handled by the various officials stipulated in the announcement from April 1st. The application forms should be kept on file by the officials. The term "enemy national" in the announcement refers to the people belonging to the following countries: United States, United Kingdom, New Zealand, Canada, Commonwealth of Australia, Union of South Africa, Haiti, Costa Rica, Honduras, Guatemala, Nicaragua, Dominican Republic, Cuba, Panama, Netherlands, Belgium. Those with the nationality of the following countries should be handled according to the provisions of Item 2: Mexico, Egypt, Greece, Colombia, Venezuela, Peru, Uruguay, Brazil, Bolivia, Ecuador, Paraguay, Iran, Iraq.

### Speculation Unsettles People; 8,000 Yuan Barrier Breached but Re-entered

Yesterday, the cash speculation market first rose and then fell back down. After breaching the 18,000 yuan barrier, it re-entered. The Japanese military notes (gunpyo) also retreated after reaching 8 yuan. Furthermore, both gold shops and the Tianjin gang sold, and in the sparse trading, the price was easy to fall and difficult to rise, and people's hearts were uneasy. From the morning, each tael (ten liang) opened with the upward trend of the previous day, immediately rising to 18,700 yuan, which was 1,200 yuan higher than the previous day's closing price and 400-500 yuan higher than the afternoon's external price. The two gold shops and Gong He Li sold heavily, and the rising wind suddenly retreated sharply by 700 yuan, suddenly reaching the 18,000 yuan mark. Yi Yuancheng, Ji De, and Lai sold heavily, but the silver shops were particularly strong in absorbing it. The rich bought it up, and it rose again to 18,350 yuan. However, as the military notes fell back, the two gold shops and securities firms came to sell heavily again, and the Tianjin gang and a certain money shop and retail investors scrambled to sell, and it fell again by 650 yuan, falling within 18,000 yuan, falling to 17,700 yuan. The noon closing at 11:30 was 17,800 yuan, which was 500 yuan higher than the previous day's closing price, but 400-500 yuan lower than the afternoon price. After the close, De Fu sold heavily to 17,550 yuan, a certain silver shop bought in, and it rose back to 17,700 yuan. There was a high of 1,000 yuan in the morning, and there were buyers at 17,800 yuan in the afternoon.

The retail price of gold jewelry was first posted at 1,950 yuan per tael, up 50 yuan by Da Xin and others, but soon fell back down to 1,900 yuan (the purchase price was reduced by 200 yuan). Refined silver was posted at 20 yuan, and there were buyers at 14 yuan in the black market. Silver coins fell back to 8.2 yuan apiece.

### Discount Rate Higher by Ten Yuan

Yesterday's discount rate for clearinghouse checks increased by another 10 yuan per thousand, to 20 yuan. The Shanghai Money Trade Association's interbank interest rate was 9 fen.

### Military Notes Once Reached 8 Yuan

Yesterday, in the foreign exchange market, the British and American gold pounds each fell by several yuan, the former to 390 yuan and the latter to 400 yuan. US dollar notes were still 25-26 yuan, and Hong Kong notes were still 3.5 yuan, with larger notes reduced by 1 jiao. Military notes once rose to 8.1 yuan in the early morning but ended at 7.8 yuan.

### Tightening Money Supply, Declining Public Bonds, Class A Small Two Yuan Surplus

Public bond trading in the unofficial market suddenly turned downward yesterday, largely due to the extremely tight money supply and the end-of-month effect. Sellers were willing to sell at any price to obtain cash, causing a sharp drop in market prices. However, Class D bonds fell the least, entirely supported by Chen Tai, which was willing to buy as much as possible at a price of 58.5 yuan, thus maintaining the market price. Le Mao and Zhou Guoji sold Class A bonds, amounting to no more than 60,000 to 70,000 yuan, but the market price fell sharply by more than two yuan, mainly because there were very few buyers at the end of the month, and the Qingming Festival was approaching, so most people were unwilling to bear the interest. Therefore, all bonds saw a decline. Companies such as Yuxing, Dingkang, Tongkang, Dazhong, Runde, Tongyuan, Fuyuan, and Jiufeng all sold. Chengkang bought nearly 300,000 yuan. Yu Yongxiang, He Ji, Tongli, Runli, Hongxing, and Xinhua also bought, mostly to cover short positions. As a result, the prices of all bonds fell, ranging from three jiao to two yuan and two jiao, with a turnover of more than 500,000 yuan. A concise table is listed below.

Yesterday, foreign stocks rose and fell unevenly, with a total of 11,500 shares traded. Jardine Matheson shares traded 2,200 shares, with the price falling from 27 yuan to 26 yuan. Only Nanyang Brothers Tobacco was active, with 1,000 shares at 7.55 yuan and 7.5 yuan. China Textile traded 2,000 shares at 10.78 yuan, 1,500 shares of Woolen Fabric at 6.3 yuan, 100 shares of Public Bus at 9 yuan, 400 shares of Shanghai Gas at 13.7 yuan, 100 shares of Steel Industry at 11.6 yuan, 1,500 shares of Paper Industry at 6.4 yuan and 6.35 yuan, 500 shares of Ye Guang at 18.4 yuan, 2,000 shares of Carlowitz at 0.85 yuan and 0.88 yuan, 200 shares of Rubber at 14.45 yuan, and 1,000 shares of Reilly Bonds at 75 yuan. No other shares were traded.

Yesterday, Chinese stocks became more stable and firm. Sino-French (New) rose 1.5 yuan to 50 yuan. New Asia (New) rose 0.7 yuan from 31.25 yuan to 32 yuan. Hong Kong Factory was 32.5 yuan. Shenghua Preferred was priced at 15.75 yuan and 16.5 yuan. China Underwear (New) was 18.5 yuan, Wing On Company was 65 yuan, Sincere was 77 yuan, down one yuan, Great China Match was 12.5 yuan, Huashang Electric was 17.75 yuan. Bank stock prices were stable.

### Scarce Yarn Supply, High Selling Prices, and Factory Orders Also High

The cotton yarn market saw a significant increase in spot prices, due to the increasingly scarce inventory, coupled with the tight and expensive military notes. As a result, sentiment improved and buying interest increased. As for Shuang Ma factory orders, speculators generally believed that they could be redeemed for cash, so the buying momentum was particularly strong. However, there is deep concern that this may not be so simple. Twenty-count Shuang Ma factory orders opened high at 3,650 yuan, but soon the bulls sold, loosening to 3,560 yuan. However, speculative buying was quite strong, rising again to 3,670 yuan, but the closing price fell back to 3,560 yuan. Forty-two count Lan Feng was 8,600 yuan to 8,950 yuan, forty-two count Shui Yue was 8,900 yuan, forty-count Di Qiu was 7,550 yuan, thirty-two count Xian Tao was 9,600 yuan, twenty-count Yue Qin was 4,130 yuan to 4,350 yuan, twenty-count Li Ma was 5,000 yuan, twenty-count Lan Feng was 5,200 yuan, twenty-count Chang Nian was 5,000 yuan, sixteen-count Hong Kui Xing was 4,320 yuan to 4,500 yuan, ten-count Hong Shuang was 2,800 yuan to 3,000 yuan, ten-count Tong Zi Jun was 2,950 yuan, ten-count Hong Bao was 2,830 yuan, eighteen-count Zhi Nv was 4,280 yuan to 4,350 yuan, and six-count Yan Zhi Hu was 4,200 yuan.

### Impact of Movement Permits, Factory Cloth Spot Prices Soft, Dong Pi Rises and Falls with Military Notes

Yesterday, the factory cloth market remained stable and firm, with factory orders continuing to rise. Spot prices rose less strongly, due to the impact of movement permits, which caused buyers to wait and see. After rising, spot prices for white cloth, coarse cloth, and twill cloth returned to level. However, because factory orders had a lower base price,囤户 continued to absorb them, and rose another five to ten yuan, with transactions becoming more active. Spot prices for white cloth Fugui fine cloth were around 170 yuan, and factory orders were 131 yuan to 135 yuan. Spot prices for Caihua Die coarse cloth were 220 yuan, and factory orders were 130 yuan. Spot prices for Shuangxiang coarse cloth were 215 yuan, and factory orders were 125 yuan. Eleven-pound San Tu coarse cloth was 135 yuan, Sanlu Hong Kong cloth was 130 yuan, Chu Ji Shilin was 270 yuan to 275 yuan, light color was 235 yuan, Chang Shou Su Fu silk was 6.1 yuan to 6.15 yuan, and Bai Mao printed cloth was 134 yuan to 138 yuan. More than 400 pieces were traded on this street.

This morning, due to the sharp rise in military notes, the Dong Pi market became strong again. Longtou fine cloth new orders opened at 228 yuan, rising to a peak of 230 yuan. Subsequently, because many long positions took profits and sold, it gradually fell to 226 yuan at the close. Later, it was heard that military notes had fallen back, and sentiment softened slightly. The initial trade was 225 yuan, rising to 227 yuan. At the evening close, there was some short selling, and it fell slightly to 220 yuan, down one yuan from the previous day's close. However, Feiyu Caiqiu remained strong, rising one yuan to 201 yuan, Yanghe was 198 yuan, Laba was 196 yuan, and Sijunzi Serge new orders for October to December reached a high of 7 yuan, and fell to 6.65 yuan at the evening close, and Hongdan was 6.46 yuan.

### Sugar Prices and Sugar Stocks Both Advancing to High Peaks

Recently, the sugar market has seen increasing prices due to the occasional peaks in military notes. If calculated on the unofficial market, the increase may be hundreds of yuan. The number of applications to purchase sugar in April totaled 71,000, but the amount supplied is only about 30,000 bags, which has not yet been determined. Cooperative sugar stocks rose nearly 60 yuan. For example, coarse sugar stocks initially were 306 yuan, rose as high as 310 yuan, and closed at 305 yuan. Raw sugar stocks opened at 295 yuan, then rose to 300 yuan, and closed at 290 yuan. Military notes reached a high of 8.15 yuan and closed at 7.7 yuan.

### Beans Rebound Sharply, Red Sorghum Falls Instead

Yesterday, retail sales of miscellaneous grains were still active, and affected by the high price of military notes, the sellers' willingness to sell was also quite firm. Therefore, the prices of beans all saw an increase of three to five yuan, and bean cakes rose by two yuan. However, red sorghum fell by 10 to 20 yuan due to the inconvenience of transportation and the small number of buyers. The whole market sold 300 packages of Tianjin Jinyuan, priced at 218 yuan to 225 yuan, 50 packages of Pinghu Du beans, priced at 200 yuan, 49 packages of Nanqiao soybeans, priced at 205 yuan, 100 packages of Huaiqiu soybeans, priced at 193 yuan, 80 packages of Wuhu soybeans, priced at 198 yuan, 250 packages of Chongming Sha Chi, priced at 203.5 yuan to 198 yuan, 200 packages of Sha Jiang, priced at 145 yuan, 7 packages of Sha Wan, priced at 115 yuan, 100 packages of Qingdao tea beans, priced at 217 yuan, 100+ packages of Anqing Xiaobai silkworm, priced at 137 yuan, 40 packages of Jiading Bai silkworm, priced at 132 yuan, 2,000 pieces of Hankou bean cake, priced at 40 yuan to 40.05 yuan, Yuanlong bean cake, November warehouse order, one car priced at 45 yuan, Li Zi bean cake, March new warehouse order, 2,000 pieces priced at 53 yuan to 53.5 yuan, Sheng Ji bean cake, 4,000 pieces, May warehouse order priced at 52 yuan to 52.5 yuan, and June warehouse order priced at 53 yuan to 53.5 yuan, April new warehouse order priced at 57 yuan.

### Domestic Rice Remains Expensive, No Standard Market Exists

Because it is no longer easy to find peddlers in the suburbs, those with domestic rice treat it as a rare commodity, and prices are increasing daily. Yesterday, it was rumored that the highest price was 40 yuan per dou, but buyers found this price too high to handle, and most sales were only around 38 yuan. Early and late rice combined were priced at 385 yuan to 380 yuan per shi, resulting in little change from the previous day. As for retail purchases in shops, because the original cost must include all kinds of fees such as transportation commissions, it seems more expensive, mostly selling for about 4 yuan per sheng. In the British Concession, because there are even fewer peddlers and few goods arrive, the selling price is higher, around 41 yuan per dou, totaling about 410 yuan per shi. In short, at present, there is no standard market price for domestic rice.

### Matches, Candles, and Soap Are Easy to Rise and Difficult to Fall

The prices of daily necessities such as matches, soap, and foreign candles are still difficult to return to lower levels, because people believe that the new currency system has deviated from its equivalent status, and the贴水 for coupon heads has reached 200 yuan per 10,000 yuan. Therefore, both inside and outside the industry,囤户 regard goods as the most reliable, and holders are temporarily suspending sales. Buyers want to collect a large amount, but it is difficult to obtain. Because various factories are under the management of the authorities and there is no news of shipments, and due to price limits and unified transportation, market inventory is becoming scarce day by day, so the owners are even more hoarding goods, and the market is easy to rise and difficult to fall. Yesterday, Meili brand matches were 7,200 yuan, Fenghuang brand was 6,800 yuan, miscellaneous brands were 5,900 yuan, Gu Ben soap was 360 yuan, Bai Xiang Mao soap was 325 yuan, Huang Xiang Mao soap was 305 yuan, and Fan Chuan brand foreign candles were 210 yuan, all of which were higher than the previous day.

### Great Hero Cigarettes Open at 12,000 Yuan

The cigarette market continues to rise, and people are uneasy. Both inside and outside the industry, 囤户 are sparing no effort to collect all kinds of goods. As a result, prices are still rising. Daying brand was 12,000 yuan per case, Lao Dao brand was 10,300 yuan, Xiao Xian Nu brand was 6,600 yuan, Wu Hua brand was 6,400 yuan, Pin Hai brand was 7,800 yuan, Ri Yan Jin Qiang brand was 3,420 yuan, Jin Da Lou brand was 3,520 yuan, Hong Mei Gui brand was 4,600 yuan, and Quan Lu brand was 3,700 yuan.

### Bitter Apricots Continue to Rise

Because there is no continuing source of supply, the market inventory of bitter apricots is extremely tight, and it continues to rise again and again. Initially, it was 350 yuan and 400 yuan, then 450 yuan. Yesterday, the market price of white-skinned bitter apricots reached 490 yuan, and red-skinned was 450 yuan.

### Shui Dong Zhi Jumps 100 Yuan

Recently, there has been a shortage of miscellaneous dried lychees, and although sales have not been too strong, market prices are still rising to high peaks. For example, Lan Zhu Zhi has risen by 70 to 80 yuan, Wu Ye Zhi has also risen by 30 to 40 yuan, and Shui Dong Bian Zhi has risen by 100 yuan.

### Jackfruit

— Gao Jiannong

Where is the homeland of the jackfruit? All botanists believe it is in tropical America, and the authoritative plant geographer De Candolle also holds the same view. He said: "In the hot regions of Mexico, in the province of Veraguas near Panama, in the valleys of the upper reaches of the Orinoco River, in Guyana, or in the province of Bahia, one can find it." However, there is something debatable about this. Once, when I was reading the "Gui Hai Yu Heng Zhi" written by the Southern Song Dynasty poet Fan Chengda and saw the entry "Lugu Zi", which said, "Lugu Zi is as big as a half-liter bowl. Looking closely, dozens of chambers are clustered together into a ball, each chamber having a seam; it is green in winter and red in summer, and eating its petals is slightly sweet." At that time, I suspected that Lugu Zi was pineapple, was jackfruit, but because this record was too brief, I dared not be sure. However, when I opened the "Ling Wai Dai Da" written by Zhou Qufei, who was a contemporary of Fan Chengda and had served as an official in Guilin (to be continued).

### Li Lingfeng and Zhang Junqiu Sever Teacher-Student Relationship

— Ni Zhongtang

Since Zhang Junqiu left Fufeng Society, a great wave has risen in the Peking opera world. Following that, Zhang's teacher, Li Lingfeng, issued a statement in the newspaper, severing the teacher-student relationship with Junqiu.

At the beginning of the Ma-Zhang split, Zhang's teacher, Li Lingfeng, also personally intervened, participating in the negotiations. However, Ma had already agreed to have Li Yuru replace Zhang, and Junqiu insisted on the previous agreement and refused to yield. Therefore, Li, in disappointment, returned the contract that was signed when he accepted Junqiu as a disciple and declared the severance of the teacher-student relationship in the newspaper. However, according to the content of the contract, it was clearly stated at the time that it was for six years, and all things, such as costumes and accessories, would be provided by Teacher Li, who would also be responsible for teaching. As for Junqiu's performance income, all of it would go to Li for the first three years, and the income for the next three years would be split in half. However, since Junqiu joined Fufeng Society, all the roles and performances were negotiated by Junqiu. Although Li was in the position of a teacher, he was simply in a passive position. Even Liang hid everything about Junqiu from Li. As a result, all other profits that Junqiu deserved beyond his salary in Fufeng went to Junqiu alone. This time, Zhang and Ma's breakup, everything was known to Li, and Ma had also shielded Junqiu for many years, causing disagreement with Teacher Zhang. Li was naturally very indignant at this stimulus. Therefore, before Junqiu formed his own troupe, Lingfeng returned the contract he had signed to him and said, "We have already formed our own troupe, so there is no need to worry about anything else. After all, we have been together. Now that you have a way out, you can go wherever you want. As for where I can fulfill my obligations, I will do my best to help you!" After saying that, he returned the contract to him. According to the above paragraph, it seems that Lingfeng had not had a major falling out with Junqiu. It is a pity that no one was willing to be a peacemaker at the time, so that the two finally severed the teacher-student relationship.

The daytime performance included Xue Xiaoqing, Pang Xueqing, Zhang Hongsheng, Zhu Yaoxiang, Zhao Jiaqiu, Zhou Yuquan, Yu Xiaoyun, Yu Xiaoxia, Yang Yuecha, Shen Jian'an, Tang Nai'an, Xia Hesheng, etc. The night performance included Gu Hongbo, Yan Xueting, Xu Ji Xiang, Xia Hesheng, etc. Tickets were sold for two yuan and one yuan, and the daytime performance was completely full.

Xue and Pang are a teacher-student pair, singing the section "Fang Qing Watching the Lanterns." Xue's dialogue is clear, and his style of the past is undiminished. Pang's melody and modulation is like a delicate girl, making people not tired of listening. As soon as Zhang Hongsheng went on stage, he immediately claimed "I am not good at rhetoric," but then he told jokes one after another. The main story tells the section of Ma Bingtou Wang Yu seeking to see the military advisor, the speed is very fast, calling it "Airplane-style hero," truly living up to his reputation. Zhu and Zhao's "Laughing and Crying Fate" sings the section of General Liu summoning Shen Fengxi. Zhu's expression is touching, and Zhao's melody is outstanding, truly a perfect match. Zhou Yuquan tells a section of "Civil and Military Scented Balls," Zhang Guiying rescuing Long Guanbao escaping down the hillside. The several horse cries have the style of Huang Zhaolin. Zhou is usually known as "lukewarm water" in the story world, but today's book performance has changed into "hot boiling water," surprising the audience. The Shuang Yu pair's singing and storytelling are amazing, singing the section "The White Snake Legend Xu Xian Confronts the Immortal," with many funny parts. Yang Yuecha's "Pearl Pagoda" is very famous. This time, he brought his younger brother Yang Xingcha and son Yang Delin on stage? Delin is only fourteen years old and sings a Manchu opening, winning cheers from the audience. The main story tells Qiu Liuqiao solving the case, which is quite stable. Shen and Tang are also a teacher-student pair, also singing "Fang Qing Watching the Lanterns." Shen excels at dialogue, and Pang's pipa playing is fluent and lively, worthy of being called the second Xue Xiaoqing. The last performance, Xia Hesheng sending off guests, tells the story of the clerk eating dumplings in "Three Smiles," describing the two treasures meticulously. Xia is a popular storyteller this year, and he can sell tickets everywhere. His specialty is that he is powerful in making jokes.

The night performance had a total of eight acts, each with its own jokes, but compared to the daytime performance, it was slightly inferior.

### Brief Biographies of Peking Opera Figures

(11) Meng Xiaodong

Meng Xiaodong is the only current successor of the Yu School. Her father's name is Meng Hongqun, and Meng Qi is her grandfather. For several generations, the family has been in the performing arts, a Peking opera family. Xiaodong initially learned opera from Qiu Yuexiang and became famous on the stage from a young age, gradually revealing her talent. However, at that time, her skills were somewhat mixed. Since going north to study under Shu Yan, she began to get on the right track, creating her current position. She performs few operas and has not devoted herself to acrobatics. (Xiaodong only knows the second half of "Zhu Lian Zhai" and does not seem to perform it well.) She does not seem to have mastered all of Shu Yan's excellences. As for singing, she is based on Shu Yan's style and has indeed put in a lot of effort. She has mastered the model and has reached a pure fire-like skill, making people listen to it as if it were the real thing, unable to distinguish whether it is her or Shu Yan. Therefore, as long as she brings out a song to sing, every song has a history, worthy of the word "specialization." This is not only a rare and outstanding talent among female roles, but also many male roles who claim to be from the Tan School. She is the purest, and no one can compare with her, with the appearance of being a pillar in the middle of the stream. I didn't expect that today, the Tan School's remaining thread of life would not be scattered immediately, and the responsibility lies on a female role. Isn't it a miracle? Meng Hongqun is an unruly Jiangnan School opera singer, but he has such a daughter to add glory to his family. It is even more unusual.

### Sharing the Same Boat Through Storms

— He Jia Zhi

(2) Sorrow and Joy

The second wife of the Ye family looked at the eldest daughter, and the eldest daughter said, "It's good, but Weicheng hasn't been engaged to that Miss yet. Since he is not engaged, this happy event cannot be held even if you want to." The second wife of the Ye family said, "That's what I said." Li Youxie simply stood on the same front with Qin Runzhi and Wei Yunqing, saying, "Qin Runzhi has a way, he can be a matchmaker immediately and ask the other party to agree immediately. He and I have talked about it briefly. Wei Yunqing has a niece, who is eighteen years old this year, and has been promised to the Zhu family. She was scheduled to marry in December of this year, but the son-in-law of the Zhu family was not lucky and died of typhoid fever, so the marriage was cancelled. Wei Yunqing's niece, all the dowry and clothes are ready, and she is the most readily available bride. If we utter a 'yes' here, they will utter a 'willing' there. I also said to Qin Runzhi that our nephew, he has studied abroad and is a young man who has seen the world. A country bumpkin who only knows how to cook and make shoes is not enough. Qin Runzhi said, 'You don't have to worry about that. Wei Yunqing's niece, this young lady is the most beautiful and the most capable. She is literate and able to read, and she can plant vegetables and work in the fields. She is a perfect match for Young Master Ye, and only Young Master Ye is worthy of marrying this young lady. The matter is as good as it can be. Qin Runzhi is still waiting at Shu Yunqing's house. As long as we send a farmhand to inform him, he will send Miss Wei's photo and horoscope. He will send the dowry in the evening and the bride tomorrow. Wei Yunqing's cousin is absolutely not like Wei Yunqing. He doesn't want to spend any money here." (38)
