### The Harsh Climate of the Caucasus: German and Soviet Troops Fight in the Rain, Battles Continue in the City of S, German Aircraft Bomb the Xiongi Airfield

German Supreme Headquarters, 23rd, Huitong News Agency

Today's German war report states that heavy rains fell in the western Caucasus, and German troops continued to fight in the rain, breaking through enemy lines and annihilating a regiment of enemy riflemen, capturing over 1,200 prisoners, seizing seven cannons, 127 machine guns, and many other munitions, and occupying two important villages. Only local battles are taking place south of the Terek River. The battle for Stalingrad continues, with our troops occupying many of the enemy's fortifications and sending aircraft to bomb enemy resistance nests north of the city. The enemy's feigned attacks in the north of the city have not succeeded. The Soviet rear transportation lines east of the Volga River continue to be bombed and destroyed by German aircraft. No significant battles are taking place in other sections of the Eastern Front. A Soviet air force base south of Murmansk was bombed by German aircraft and caught fire.

Berlin, 22nd, Havas News Agency

It is reported that German aircraft bombed the Xiongi Airfield, located 15 miles south of Murmansk Port in the Soviet Union, yesterday, causing significant damage.

Berlin, 20th, Huitong News Agency

It has just been announced here that the Soviet army's attack on the German bridgehead in the Volkhov sector on the 20th of this month did not succeed. The German garrison there is the Battens Regiment, which has encountered enemy attacks 133 times and counterattacked 51 times in one year.

Berlin, 22nd, Huitong News Agency

On Tuesday, the Soviet army, with three infantry divisions and 120 tanks, launched an attack on German forces between the Don and Volga Rivers, attempting to defend the Soviet Union's last stronghold in Stalingrad, the October Revolution Factory. However, this attack was repelled by German forces, and the Soviet army suffered heavy losses. German anti-tank gun units destroyed 40 enemy tanks. German and Romanian aircraft participated in the battle to prevent the arrival of enemy reinforcements. In the battle for the October Revolution Factory in Stalingrad, German forces occupied many key positions. At the same time, German aircraft heavily bombed the last Soviet stronghold. Photographs taken by the Germans prove the magnitude of the Soviet losses, with fires breaking out in many buildings of the factory. German aircraft have absolute air superiority, and when Soviet aircraft appear, German fighter planes immediately intercept them to prevent their activity. German anti-aircraft gun units shot down four Soviet aircraft over the city. Although the weather on the Eastern Front is poor, it has no impact on the battle for Stalingrad. The intensity and difficulty of the battle for the city are unparalleled in history.

### Swedish Military Observers Analyze the Battlefield Situation in Stalingrad

Stockholm, Sweden, 21st, Havas News Agency

Military observers here have analyzed the battlefield situation in Stalingrad, stating that since German forces occupied the Chekists Factory and the Red Barricades Factory in the northern suburbs of the city, the Red Army there has retreated to the October Revolution Factory, taking refuge in the ruins. Although subjected to intense bombing by German aircraft and artillery, they are still resisting resolutely. It is reported that the Red Army has stored a large number of cannons, machine guns, and mortars in this factory. Judging from the intensity of the Red Army's artillery fire, it is clear that the defending forces still possess a large amount of ammunition sufficient for prolonged resistance. However, communication between this last center of resistance and the main Soviet lines has now been cut off. Since the pontoon bridge built with gasoline drums was destroyed, it has not been possible to obtain supplies. Especially in two or three weeks, the Volga River will freeze solid, becoming as hard as stone, which could facilitate transportation. However, it is feared that by that time, the battle will have become a thing of the past. According to the latest news from Berlin, German forces have completed mopping-up operations in the Red Barricades Factory area, and their assault teams yesterday occupied a new position, sufficient to serve as a base for launching a final offensive against the October Revolution Factory. German aircraft dispatched no fewer than 3,000 sorties to bomb various factories, but were greatly affected by the adverse weather. Therefore, German forces switched to using artillery to bombard the October Revolution Factory. In other battle areas as well, the fighting has largely subsided due to continuous autumn rains. The situation in each area is described as follows: (1) In the Caucasus, German forces have now occupied a base between the Kuba River and the Black Sea. Fierce fighting is taking place near Georgievsk (10 miles north of Tuapse Port). Despite the Red Army's resolute resistance and the rugged terrain, German forces made some progress yesterday. The Red Army has apparently changed its strategy, no longer continuing to retreat towards Tuapse Port, but hiding in the mountain cliffs and engaging in guerrilla warfare. (2) In the Mozdok area, the Red Army's headquarters has also adopted a guerrilla warfare strategy, recapturing several villages yesterday. German advances on the cities of Grozny and Ordzhonikidze have not made progress. (3) On the Novorossiysk line, German forces seem to have the upper hand, but the German side admits that the factories on the outskirts of the city have been converted into fortresses and are currently engaged in fierce fighting. The Red Army is still holding the outskirts of the city, which is clear evidence of this.

### The Life and Health of Working Women: Do Not Neglect Health Because of Life; Maintaining Health Increases Productivity

In order to seek independence in life, the majority of modern women have to leave their families to participate in productive enterprises. Although this is a good phenomenon, the combination of mental and physical exertion and various challenges inevitably leads to considerable consumption of spirit and strength. Therefore, working women must not neglect their physical health.

Generally speaking, the trend of women competing with men in the same occupations is an irreversible tendency but, due to various factors, women are physically and mentally weaker than men. If they disregard fatigue and devote themselves wholeheartedly to service, they will eventually become mentally exhausted and physically weak, falling into a state of ill health. Therefore, women's occupational lives must be suited to their physical condition, and they must carefully consider their abilities before taking employment.

That being said, in this era of economic depression, tidal waves of unemployment sweeping everywhere, soaring prices, and extreme difficulty in life, how can people have the opportunity to choose jobs under this double pressure? Modern working women cannot care about or talk about physical health. Most women are dragging their weakened bodies, unable to avoid struggling through tears in order to survive, reluctantly taking on jobs they are unwilling to do or are not up to. What will the result be? This goes without saying.

However, should we simply entrust everything to fate without trying to improve, rise up, and fight against hardships? No, that is not right. We should find ways to strengthen our bodies first and build a foundation. With a healthy physique and ample physical strength, it will not be difficult to break through all the shackles of hardship, and life will be improved and fulfilling as a result.

The first step to strengthening the body is to improve nutrition. How can a healthy physique be obtained without good nutrition? Whether the nutritional state is good or bad depends on the strength of the gastrointestinal function. If the stomach and intestines are not healthy, even if there is food rich in nutrients, it cannot be fully digested and absorbed, and the body will naturally have difficulty obtaining its nourishing effects. Ruosu, a sacred medicine that has always been known for strengthening the intestines and nourishing the stomach, due to its excellent and complex composition, can strengthen the function of the stomach and intestines, aid digestion, promote nutrition, nourish the brain, replenish blood, lubricate the intestines, promote bowel movements, nourish the spirit, and promote restful sleep. It has special effects on women's common symptoms such as neurasthenia, shortness of breath, chest tightness, insomnia, headache, habitual constipation, anemia, reduced appetite, loss of appetite, indigestion, pregnancy edema, nausea, and vomiting, as well as female diseases such as endocrine disorders, poor blood quality, and irregular menstruation. Furthermore, regular consumption of Ruosu can thoroughly improve the constitution.

Ruosu is sold in pharmacies everywhere. Because the ingredients of Ruosu are Vitamin B1-B6, powerful digestive enzymes, hormones, protein, phosphorus, iron, calcium, etc., it is an excellent medicine for women.

### New Cabinet Formed in Chile; New Government Has a Strong Pro-U.S. Tendency

Santiago, Chile, 22nd, Huitong News Agency

Less than 24 hours after the resignation of the Chilean cabinet, a new cabinet has been formed. Only three members of the previous cabinet have joined the new cabinet: Minister of the Interior Morales, Minister of National Defense Duhalde, and Minister of Agriculture Moller. The positions occupied by various political parties in the new cabinet have also changed. The Radical Party held five seats in the previous cabinet, but only holds three seats in the new cabinet. The Socialist Party held three seats in the previous cabinet and has increased to four seats in the new cabinet. The Democratic Party has lost one seat in the new cabinet. It is also learned today that Lisko refused to accept the post of Foreign Minister in the new Chilean cabinet, and Former Chilean Ambassador to Uruguay, Mr. Fontes, has been appointed as the new foreign minister, and Mr. Fontes is expected to return to China within three days to take up his new post. Currently, the work of the ministry is temporarily handled by the Minister of National Defense.

Santiago, Chile, 22nd, Havas News Agency

Santiago, Chile, 22nd, Huitong News Agency

The Chilean Ministry of National Defense has newly established a committee to adjust military strategies. All members are senior staff officers from the Army, Navy, and Air Force. Army Chief of Staff Ascudero has been appointed as the Chairman. General Laran has succeeded to the position of Army Chief of Staff.

Buenos Aires, Argentina, 22nd, Central News Agency

According to a dispatch from Santiago, Chilean leftists, led by Foreign Minister Hermes, successfully caused the Chilean cabinet to tender its collective resignation on the 20th. Because of the complex political situation, Rios is urgently weighing the options for new cabinet members to form a coordinated cabinet. According to former Interior Minister Morales on the 21st, President Rios decided to organize a new cabinet within 48 hours to resolve the crisis. It is reported that the Chilean conservatives have vehemently attacked the leftist Socialist Party and supported the dismissal of Foreign Minister Hermes. Even President Rios himself has been regarded as the most right-leaning member of the Radical Party, so he has secretly supported Foreign Minister Hermes' policies. Recently, after U.S. Under Secretary of State Welles made a speech, a dispute arose in U.S.-Chilean relations. The leftists took this opportunity to intensify the movement to attack the Foreign Minister, which led to political turmoil and difficulty in resolving the situation. However, President Rios has now decided to integrate and adjust the forces of all parties after the dissolution of this cabinet. The candidates for the new cabinet are not yet known. It is also impossible to judge what changes will occur in the Chilean government's foreign policy in the future. However, it can be predicted that although the Chilean government will not suddenly turn into an extreme anti-Axis policy, there is no doubt that its pro-American tendency will be more pronounced as a result.

### General Smuts Delivers Speech in England, Stating Offensive Stage Has Arrived, Advocates Giving Full Aid to Soviet Union, Mrs. Roosevelt to Meet with Smuts

Lisbon, 22nd, Allied News Agency Telegram

According to a London dispatch, South African Federal Prime Minister Smuts delivered his long-awaited speech in the British Parliament yesterday, warning that if the war continues, the conflicts in Europe, Africa, and the Pacific will become more intense. Smuts, dressed in military uniform and adorned with medals, spoke in a solemn atmosphere in the secret assembly hall of the Institute of Engineers. Over a thousand nobles and members of the House of Commons attended. Chairman Lloyd George introduced Smuts, describing him as one of the foremost statesmen of modern times, and stated that they were gathered to hear his profound insights on the most terrible war the British Empire had ever experienced. In his speech, Smuts said that the defensive posture of the past had ended, and the final offensive had begun. Both sides were sharpening their swords and preparing their horses, and large-scale mobilization of resources, whether on the front lines or in the rear, had matured. Smuts warned that the do-or-die struggle was upon them, and they must not flinch. The closer to the end, the more brutal and violent it would become. Although the Allied nations had suffered setbacks and disappointments, they had been blessed with time to evade the Axis powers' blows. The Soviet Union bore a greater responsibility and should be given swift and sufficient aid. Germany's attack on the Soviet Union was a major mistake. The scale and duration of Soviet resistance surprised not only Hitler but everyone else. The losses in this world war were unprecedented.

Lisbon, 22nd, Huitong News Agency Telegram

According to London news, Smuts, in his speech to the British Parliament, stated that the defensive phase of the war had passed and the final offensive stage had arrived. News from the front lines and various quarters indicated that the opportunity for a large-scale Allied offensive had matured.

### Goebbels Declares Germany Has Overcome Difficulties

Gotenhafen, 22nd, Huitong News Agency Telegram

German Propaganda Minister Dr. Goebbels delivered a speech yesterday condemning British bombing of undefended cities as inhumane. Goebbels claimed that while they were winning the decisive battle in Eastern Europe, Western Europe was suddenly attacked, injuring the innocent. They would fight and defeat the Soviet Union's fighting force in the Eastern European theater and then deal with the British. Goebbels warned the Allied nations not to underestimate Germany's fighting capacity. They had overcome their difficulties and were capable of fighting to the end. From raw materials to the people, Germany was united as one. They were in a proactive position in the European war and their military situation was extremely solid.

Berlin, 22nd, Huitong News Agency Telegram

German Propaganda Minister Dr. Goebbels published an essay in the Deutsche Wochenzeitung stating that the element of time had turned against Britain and was no longer in its favor. Britain claimed that time was on its side and that the British army could ultimately achieve final victory despite repeated defeats. If Britain had been able to use the past three years to expand its territory and consolidate its wartime economic foundation, while Germany had not used the time, then Britain's argument would be very accurate. However, Britain had gained nothing in the past three years. Britain's strength had suffered a fatal blow, while the strength Germany had increased would have a decisive impact on the current war. The once-proud and wealthy nation was becoming increasingly impoverished, while the impoverished nation had seized important military raw materials. Germany had no fear of famine, while the Soviet Union had admitted to famine. The United States was facing a rubber crisis even more severe than Japan's and Germany's. The Axis powers would control the advantage of oil supply, not to mention the advantage in coal and iron. Britain's war theory had been completely upended. Britain had failed to blockade Germany and had instead been blockaded by Germany. The Axis powers had secured a safe foundation for continuing the war. The longer the war lasted, the greater the Axis powers' chances of victory would become. In the past three years, the British Empire had collapsed. Britain had not only lost territory but also abundant resources. The United States and the Soviet Union had also suffered the same fate. Without steel, oil, and wheat, they could not fight. By examining the map, one could clearly see the resources the enemy had lost, and what the enemy had lost had all been gained by the Axis powers. The biggest mistake in British wartime propaganda was to view space as a burden and time as a favorable factor. However, in wartime, seizing space was even more important than seizing time. Only those who maintained space could use time. Germany's occupation of vast territories would ensure final victory.

### Fierce Air Battles Occur on Alamein Front, Total of 400 Aircraft Involved, Axis Air Force Attacks Gibraltar

Berlin, 22nd, Huitong News Agency Telegram

The German High Command announced last night that at noon on October 20th, 20 British bombers, protected by 150 fighters, attacked the Alamein German front in batches. German Messerschmitt fighters immediately took off to intercept and prevent the British aircraft from dropping bombs. During the air battle between Britain and Germany, German anti-aircraft guns fired intense artillery fire, preventing enemy aircraft from deploying their bombing skills. Two bombers were shot down. Fierce air battles continued beyond the range of German anti-aircraft guns. Although British aircraft attacked repeatedly, they were repelled by German aircraft. According to current information, British losses were nine aircraft, while Germany lost only one aircraft. German fighter pilots were injured. Several British aircraft were forced to land in the desert.

Rome, 22nd, Huitong News Agency Telegram

The Italian High Command announced this afternoon that a fierce air battle occurred in Egypt the day before yesterday. Each side deployed about 100 aircraft. We achieved a great victory.

One of our aircraft did not return to base. The night before last, our aircraft bombed military targets in Gibraltar. The German and Italian air forces continued to bomb Malta day and night.

### Britain Temporarily Postpones Hess's Trial, Eden Replies to Questions from Members of Parliament in the House of Commons

London, 21st, Havas News Agency Telegram

Foreign Secretary Eden, in response to questions from Member of Parliament Dilbourg in the House of Commons, stated that the Soviet government had not requested Britain to bring Hess to trial early. The British government believed that Hess's case should be handled together with the Allied nations' trial of war criminals and that there was no reason for a separate trial. The British government had suggested to the Allied nations that an investigative committee be formed first and was awaiting a reply from the Soviet Union. At present, all he could say was that Hess's treatment since his capture on June 10, 1941, was the same as that of other prisoners of war. Furthermore, the London Times also published an editorial on this matter, stating that Moscow was evidently regretting that the British and American decision to organize a special court to try war criminals had not been consulted with them. The Soviet Union's request for an immediate trial of Hess was another expression of dissatisfaction. This was the same as the Soviet side expressing dissatisfaction with Britain's bombing of Germany, which was considered insufficient to contain it. The Soviet Union was currently under tremendous pressure and was almost unbearable, and was eager to find a way out. However, there was no reason for an immediate trial of Hess. He was a prisoner of war and was being treated as a prisoner. To investigate the ringleaders of enemy nations, it was necessary to consult archives, which was extremely difficult in the current environment.

Washington, 21st, Havas News Agency Telegram

Regarding the Soviet Union's request for a public trial of German Deputy Führer Hess before the end of the war, political figures here recently commented that if Hess were sentenced to death and executed immediately, most Allied officers and soldiers would be killed by Germany in retaliation. Therefore, it was hoped that Britain would not agree to the Soviet government's suggestion.

### Expediting Sugar Allocation, Adjusting Sugar Merchants' Businesses, Retail Sugar Not Allowed for Resale for Profit, Illegal Black Market Transactions to Be Strictly Investigated

In order to expedite the allocation of sugar, the Shanghai Sugar Industry Cooperative is re-adjusting the sugar registered with the cooperative. While the two categories of Class A and Class B remain unchanged in principle, the cumulative clauses have been revised by the Board of Directors. South goods stores and other direct retail outlets are classified as Class A, while sugar confectionery stores that process raw sugar into confectionery for sale are classified as Class B.

Retail Sugar Not Allowed for Resale

Regarding the operation of Class A retail merchants: (1) Must have a license; (2) Must have a physical storefront and actually engage in retail sales; (3) Must operate their own business and not attach their brand name to other businesses or stores; (4) If changing or modifying the brand name, or changing the registered details, must report for review and approval; no unauthorized changes are allowed; (5) If relocating the store, must report for investigation and approval. Retail sugar is only allowed to be supplied to legitimate customers and cannot be resold to other businesses or factories.

Sales Records Subject to Inspection at Any Time

Regarding the operation of Class B retail merchants: (1) Allocated sugar is only allowed to be processed into food products and cannot be resold to any business or individual; (2) Confectionery factories must manufacture and sell sugar in accordance with the regulations of the authorities. For sales within the city, the sugar content cannot exceed 50%; for sales outside the city, the sugar content cannot exceed 30%, and the sugar content of all manufactured sugar must be marked separately and sent to the cooperative for inspection; (3) The Confectionery Industry Association should appoint representatives to be responsible to the cooperative for the above two points; (4) Changes to the sugar brand and relocation are subject to the same regulations as Class A. Class A and Class B retail merchants must keep complete records of the allocated sugar. All existing sugar, regardless of origin, must be recorded in the accounts and not concealed. All subsequent inventory and sales figures must be accurately recorded and available for inspection.

Ordered to Crack Down on Black Market Transactions

It is also understood that black market transactions have recently occurred in the local sugar market. The reason is that Class B retail merchants are using the excuse of manufacturing confectionery to disguise the processing of granulated sugar and smuggle it for export. Class A retail merchants are also reselling to Class B retail merchants, and there are also large-scale private sales to rural merchants for sale in the surrounding countryside. If retail outlets are offered black market prices, they are willing to sell. Now, the Sugar Industry Cooperative has been instructed by the authorities that in the future, regardless of Class A or Class B, if black market activities are discovered again, the sugar stores involved will be permanently suspended from allocation and may be subject to business suspension and severe penalties depending on the circumstances.

Sugar Allocation for This Month Begins

According to information from the Sugar Industry Cooperative, the current sugar stock in the city is more than 200,000 bags. Based on a monthly consumption of 20,000 bags, it can be maintained until at least June next year. In terms of allocation, the cooperative allocates an appropriate amount of sugar to 58 wholesale sugar merchants each month, and then the sugar merchants distribute it to approximately 1,100 registered retail stores. The allocation for October began two or three days ago, and sugar merchants and retail stores are busy collecting goods in order to sell them as soon as possible.

### Shen Ronghua Accused of Two Crimes, Released on Bail, Rescheduled for Retrial

Chen Bingsheng from Pudong, 25 years old this year, moved with his wife Chen Xingying to the second floor of 55 Xuehuali Road this spring. The law office of Shen Ronghua, a local lawyer, was downstairs. Because Chen Bingsheng worked in Zhoupu and rarely stayed in Shanghai, Shen saw that Chen's wife was beautiful, young, and charming, and coveted her. He often lingered in Chen's bedroom in his spare time. Over time, the two developed an ambiguous relationship and then a passionate affair. On the 18th of last month, Chen's wife took her clothes, jewelry, and cash and fled to her brother-in-law surnamed Zhou. Shen Ronghua's wife learned about this and reported it to the police, who went to catch the adulterers but failed. She then moved to the Zhang Tongmao Hotel on Jixiang Street. When Chen Bingsheng returned to Shanghai and saw that the house was empty, he interrogated the maid and learned the truth. He then filed a lawsuit accusing Shen Ronghua of instigating theft and adultery, requesting strict punishment according to the law. The case was heard in the Second Criminal Court yesterday. The court held that the defendant Shen Ronghua was a lawyer who had now violated criminal law and tarnished the reputation of lawyers. The court ordered the defendant to be released on bail and rescheduled the retrial.

### Record of Lectures at the Rongwu Society

The 69th lecture of the Rongwu Sutra Society was given by Mr. Shen Jueling, discussing "A Glimpse of the Analects." In the chapter "Hua Er," Youzi stated that filial piety and brotherly love are the foundation of benevolence, which is the foundation of being a person. The chapter "Tan Gong" in the Book of Rites says that Ziyou said that Youzi's words were like those of the master, everywhere the same. The chapter "Yan Yuan" answered Duke Ai's question, "If the people have enough, who will be short? If the people are not enough, who will have enough?" These sincere words show that a disciple should be filial at home and respect his elders when out. This can be compared with Mencius's words, "Walking slowly behind elders is called brotherly respect; walking quickly ahead of elders is called disrespect." Entering to serve one's father and elder brothers, and going out to serve one's superiors. The 300 poems in the chapter "Wei Zheng" can be summarized as "no evil thoughts." Zhu Xi's "Collected Commentaries on the Book of Songs" even considers "wind and rain" to be poems of illicit love, which is not in line with Confucius's teachings on poetry. Answering Zixia's question about filial piety, "the difficulty lies in one's attitude," shows that serving one's parents with respect is the foundation. Being able to nourish them is not enough to be considered filial. Attacking heresies is harmful. This can be compared with the saying in the "Wei Ling Gong" chapter, "Having teaching but not changing." It can be seen that attacking heresies is contrary to the great way. A guest answered Wangsun Jia, "There is nowhere to pray if you offend Heaven," which is similar to advocating a single God. The chapter "Li Ren" says, "Poverty and meanness are what people dislike, but they will not leave if they are obtained in the right way." This means that if one cannot find a way to share poverty and hardship, one will not leave. The chapter "Gongye Chang" says, "Although he is in fetters, he can marry. The importance lies in whether he is guilty." Would Confucius be willing to marry his daughter to a criminal? The chapter "Yong Ye" says, "How virtuous is Hui! A bamboo bowl of rice, a gourd of water, people cannot bear the worry, but Hui does not change his joy." The chapter "Shu Er" says, "Eating coarse rice, drinking water, and using one's arm as a pillow, joy is also in it." It can be seen that Yan and Hui's joy lies only in being content with poverty. The chapter "Tai Bo" says, "If you have the talents and beauty of the Duke of Zhou, if you are proud and stingy, the rest is not worth seeing." "Stingy" means using words to cover up faults, not being miserly. The chapter "Wei Ling Gong" says, "When it comes to benevolence, one does not yield to the teacher." "Teacher" refers to the masses, not the teacher. The teacher should also not yield to the masses when it comes to benevolence. Yang Zhongyi then supplemented its meaning, such as disciples using their remaining strength to study literature, etc., which was described in great detail. It is said that the 70th lecture on the 25th will be given by Hong Qingdaoren.

### Police Personnel Talk About Sharp Decline in Crime in Shanghai, Police Cooperation Ensures Peace and Tranquility

The English-language 大美晚报 reported that Shanghai, which not long ago was a place rampant with bandits and thugs, with murder, kidnapping, and armed robbery occurring almost daily, can now be described as one of the most law-abiding cities in the world. According to spokespersons for the police departments of the Public Concession and the French Concession, there have been no criminal cases in either district this month.

Decline in Crime Is Laudable

As far as the spokespersons can recall, such a situation has never occurred in Shanghai's long history. The French Concession's crime statistics had recently recorded several cases of unarmed robbery, but this month there have been only a few cases of petty theft, which cannot be classified as criminal cases. In the Public Concession, the only criminal activity worth recording was a minor case of street robbery, and even this case is quite suspicious. This achievement is largely due to the cooperation between the regular patrol teams and the police force, which is quite unexpected.

Cooperation Between Self-Defense and Police Is Effective

Most of the petty theft cases in the French Concession this month occurred at night during the blackout, but even these minor cases have disappeared in the last four nights of the blackout period. The Baojia organizations have recently launched an educational campaign to encourage civilians to cooperate in preventing illegal activities, and the cooperation between self-defense members and police has become even more effective. Therefore, police personnel are confident that Shanghai will be able to maintain its current state of peace and tranquility.

### Murderer Awaits Sentencing

Wang Chunting, a Ningbo native who worked as an inspector at the Meikang Silk Factory on Jiaozhou Road and also served as a guarantor for a gambling den, had many enemies. On the evening of January 9th of last year, he went to a restaurant at 596 Hankou Road for a meal. When he came out, he was shot in a vital area by several thugs. The police station in charge sent personnel to take Wang to Baolong Hospital for treatment, but he died. The murderers fled and there were no clues to be found. Recently, Chinese and Western detectives at the Putuo Road police station received a tip-off and arrested suspects Xu Rongsheng, also known as Xiao Xizi (29 years old), from Jiangbei, and Zhang Ada (32 years old), from Shaoxing. They were handed over to the court and prosecuted for murder. However, both defendants firmly denied the charges. The case was continued yesterday and the two defendants were ordered to be detained and sentenced on the 28th.

### Punishment for Trafficking Women

Li Yongchang and Liu Shibao from Yangzhou, residing at No. 91, Yonghe Lane, Kaifeng Road, colluded with Changzhou woman Yu Gu, and Jiangbei women Zhang, Lu Zhu, Xie Ma, and Wu Guizhen, specializing in abducting women from good families and selling them to Wuhu for profit. The case was uncovered by Wang Debiao, a detective from the Hongkou Police Station, who rescued Zhou Amao, a local girl of fifteen, Chen Amei, a Guangdong girl of seventeen, and two girls, Sha Amei, etc., who had already been claimed by their families. They were all sent to court. Yesterday morning, Li Yongchang and Liu Shibao were each sentenced to two years, Yu Gu was sentenced to one year, and Hua Zhang and the other four were each sentenced to five months as a warning.

### An Interview with Intellectual Youth and Peking Opera Amateur Chen Dahuo (Part 2)

Judging from the results of his 20-day performance at the Tianchan Theater, it can be said to be a success. It is his first time performing professionally. Given the corrupt environment of the company, the box office for his solo performances can be considered good. On average, there are more than 1,000 spectators every day. Artistically speaking, he follows the path of heaven and does not engage in any evil practices. His material is excellent and his path is very upright. The commentary in "Yunshi Drama Talk" is very appropriate. It is also said that his voice is clear and melodious. Although it is slightly thin and flat, his high and low notes are very moving. Except for the fact that his innate physique is too small, there is nothing else to criticize. He is truly a good actor who is worth cultivating. The problem lies in his stage fright and slight affectation, which is due to a lack of stage experience. This cannot be forced. Given time, he will calm down and succeed.

When he was young, he was responsible for his tasks. He was so addicted to opera that he was always humming tunes while eating and sleeping. It can be said that he forgot to eat and sleep. At the age of thirteen, he held a fan and sat alone on the branches of a tree, learning to sing "The Empty City Stratagem". His father, Chen Zhaoshen, was originally from Fujian, and his mother was from Jiangxi. He was born in Shandong and grew up in Beijing. At that time, his father was the Director of Education in Shandong, equivalent to the current Director of the Education Department. His uncle, Wang Xifan, was a Hanlin scholar and a sworn brother of Yuan Shikai. He was deeply favored by Empress Dowager Cixi. His relatives and brothers all liked to sing opera. He became a thorough opera fan from an early age. Afterwards, from naval school all the way to graduation, and then from the Provincial Shanghai Middle School to Jiaotong University, following Zeng Yangfu in the Zhejiang Highway Bureau, he always maintained a very strong interest in Peking Opera. In Hangzhou, every morning, regardless of winter or summer, rain or snow, he would run alone to the West Lake to stretch his voice and shout. After finishing his official duties, he would sing opera with his comrades. He learned opera from many people and the percussion completely from Mr. Ruidebao. He learned opera with one principle in mind: he did not worship idols, he did not specialize in any one school, and he did not idolize anyone. He said that famous actors do not necessarily sing well, and unknown actors do not necessarily have good tunes. Therefore, he did not dare to claim to be a follower of any one school. For example, if he were a Tan school, he would have only seen the old Tan's plays when he was young. How could he have understood the art of the old Tan? The same is true for Yu Shuyan. He never followed one person to the end when learning opera. He learned a bit from this person and a bit from that person. The same is true for listening to opera. He would start listening from the opening play. The opening play is not necessarily bad. Maybe he could learn something special. The plays of famous actors at the end of the show may not be good. He did not dare to say that other people's performances were bad, nor did he arbitrarily flatter others. If someone had a special skill, he would learn from it. He absorbed the strengths of all parties and used his own wisdom to study and refine them. It had to be in line with his ideals and the plot of the play, and then be transformed into his own. This is just like learning calligraphy and painting by copying steles. He did not flatter the Tan school, nor did he oppose the Ma school. Zhang San and Li Si were both good. They each had their own strengths, and he had to learn from them. This spirit is worthy of admiration. This is also because he received a high level of education and was able to understand the mysteries of it. Professional actors only know how to imitate, they know the how but not the why. The reason why Yan Jupeng was able to speak accurately and clearly was because he came from a family with a solid foundation in classical learning, which is why he became a professional actor. However, Dahuo still needs to work hard to improve. Some of his tunes are still not free from vulgarity. This is because he has learned too much. His "Hongyang Cave" and "Li Lu Tablet" are not suitable for his identity and need to be studied more. "Zhan Taiping" and "Qun Chen Banquet in the Palace" (his expression is not enough). "The Empty City Stratagem" is a success.

Finally, I should talk about his experience. His parents were important officials in the late Qing Dynasty and early Republic of China. He was born thirteen days after his mother died. He was raised by his aunt. His uncle was very powerful in the Qing court. He entered naval school at the age of thirteen and graduated at the age of nineteen with a degree in navigation. After graduation, he was supposed to intern on a ship for half a year. During the third month of his internship, he suddenly contracted measles and his whole body was swollen. It took three months to recover. The doctor told him that it was absolutely not advisable to live on the sea again. He came to Shanghai and worked at the Jiangnan Shipyard. The director of the factory was his elder brother, Chen Daxian. Later, he wanted to continue his studies and took the entrance exam to Jiaotong University but was not admitted. He changed to the Provincial Shanghai Middle School for more than a year. He was recommended by Zheng Tonghe, the principal of Shanghai Middle School, to enter Jiaotong University for half a year. He dropped out because his English was not good enough. While at school, he liked to play soccer and broke his nose while playing soccer. In short, he was a naughty child. He was good at both singing opera and sports. After dropping out of school, he followed Zeng Yangfu to work in the Highway Bureau of the Zhejiang Provincial Government, where he laid the foundation for his opera singing. After Zeng left Zhejiang, he returned to Shanghai and worked in the banking industry. He founded "Banking Life" magazine, soliciting contributions from famous economists such as Ma Shinei, Chu Tang, Qing Zeng, and Wu Yugan. In his spare time, he studied Peking Opera with a teacher. Later, when Zeng Yangfu became the mayor of Guangzhou, he went to Guangzhou to work in the Transportation Management Office. After the fall of Guangzhou, he fled to the mountains with his family and spent the night on the top of the mountain, escaping from Guangzhou under gunfire and bombs. He arrived in Hong Kong and returned to Shanghai. After experiencing many hardships, he decided to sell his singing. He performed in Hankou for half a month and felt that his performance was not bad and had a considerable grasp of the art. He then officially performed in Shanghai. (Jiang Zhong)

Essays

### Hard Work

— Yu

After the publication of Jing Jun's "Diligent Study and Practice," Yongfu, Li Boqi, and Wen Zhujun have written letters, either praising or questioning it. These opinions are all very valuable.

What Jing Jun advocates is recognizing the difficulties of the times, but in order to overcome this extremely difficult space, one must rely on one's own strength. This is a positive and hardworking approach, which is also the promotion of Mozi's philosophy of diligent practice.

The progress of the times must be supported by a hopeful goal. Only by striving can one survive, and only by striving can one succeed. Of course, many young people shed tears and sweat but still cannot avoid hunger and cold. Many spend their leisurely days in tea rooms, restaurants, casinos, and theaters. In comparison, the cost of diligent practice seems questionable. This is a temporary phenomenon and not a permanent result.

Yan Hui ate a handful of rice and drank a ladle of water in a humble alley. People could not bear his suffering, but Yan Hui did not change his happiness. Only by taking hard work as joy and taking diligent practice as joy can one avoid feeling inferior to those who enjoy temporary pleasures.

The main purpose of Jing Jun's article is to encourage today's youth to adopt the principles of hard work and endurance. We sympathize with her position. Readers may question it due to their own experiences and circumstances, but the hope that young people will actively strive is the same goal by different paths.

Diligent practice is the highest goal of life, and hard work is the inevitable experience of diligent practice.

### Success Lies in Persistence

— Xintang

Both Mr. Jiang Zhuzhuang and Mr. Ding Fubao have achieved scholarly success. In terms of physical and mental well-being, they appear healthier and stronger as they age. What truly amazes people is that both of them were frail scholars in their youth, almost succumbing to consumption. However, instead of following that path, they attained today's health and success solely by adhering to the principle of perseverance.

I was born too late to witness their youthful lives, but I have learned details from their notes and conversations. In their twenties, both were as thin as dried wood, and even life insurance companies refused to insure them. Consequently, Mr. Ding resolved to study hygiene, while Mr. Jiang devoted himself to meditation. One approached it from a scientific perspective, the other from a spiritual one. They were diligent and tireless for decades, always upholding the principle of perseverance. As a result, they are both hale and hearty today. Mr. Ding is renowned in the medical world, saving countless lives. Mr. Jiang has made celebrated contributions to Buddhism and philosophy and now teaches meditation, sharing his practical experience with the world. Their achievements are extraordinary. Only those who can persevere can truly succeed.

### Quotations

— Xu Pu

Investing in knowledge yields the best interest.

Laziness makes everything difficult; diligence makes everything easy.

Employ your business; do not be employed by your business.

Living without diligence is a sin; diligence without artistry is brutish.

The physical principle that action and reaction are equal also applies to morality.

Small oversights can lead to great disasters.

Courage in excess is foolhardiness; love in excess is doting; thrift in excess is avarice.

An ounce of courage is worth a ton of luck.

### Torn Socks

— Lu Shen

When going out, one should always dress neatly. Looking at the black and white cloth-soled shoes, I couldn't help but frown at my socks. The heels and soles had been mended countless times, new patches layered upon old, resembling a painted face. Were it not for the hem of the long gown covering them, the truth would be exposed. In that situation, it would be unimaginable.

It is said that everyone in the world has their own tricks and deceptions, varying in their ingenuity. However, that ingenuity depends on how clever one is. Otherwise, like the wind blowing up the hem of a long gown, a Western-style embarrassment would be revealed. There are also those who consider themselves clever, like people who fold the torn sock heel under their foot and stuff it into their shoe, thinking they won't be exposed. Little do they know that after walking for a while, their secret will inevitably be revealed, and the torn sock heel will gradually show itself. Therefore, deceit never lasts.

Furthermore, being seen with a torn sock heel is not shameful. Yet, people try to conceal it, considering it a great disgrace once revealed. However, whether a person's character and conduct are patched together is overlooked, which is strange.

### Sharing the Same Boat

— He Jia Zhi

(10) Flying Peak

Mrs. Ye Er was always an alarmist, constantly urging Wei Cheng and Huang Long to sleep during the day, saying, "If you sleep during the day, you won't need to sleep at night. Problems always happen at night. If you're awake at night, you'll be prepared." Wei Cheng felt that his aunt's words weren't without reason. So he and Bi Hua rested during the day and stayed up at night, day after day. A Xing and others outside heard bits and pieces of news, saying that Qin Runzhi was indeed a swindler. The Wei family had to pay for their son's funeral themselves and didn't ask Qin Runzhi to raise money. It was also said that after Wei Yunqing's son died, more people were recommending he take a concubine than offering condolences. Fei Changhe wanted to give his daughter, A Qiao, to Wei Yunqing as a concubine, but Wei Yunqing refused. It was also rumored that the heroes who beat Wei Shaoyun to death were all surnamed Huang. This news was the most shocking. Mrs. Ye Er and Wei Cheng turned pale upon hearing it. But then they heard that the "Ninth Huang" had been captured by Wei Yunqing and sent to the county. Wei Cheng knew that Huang Long had simply fallen asleep after getting drunk, but he couldn't help but tiptoe over to check if Huang Long was unharmed. Only after seeing that he was fine did he feel relieved.

Cui Zhen's foot always limped. When she saw Wei Cheng walking over, she stopped and refused to walk further. Wei Cheng said, "Sister Cui Zhen, have you become disabled from suffering?" Cui Zhen said, "No, no, it will naturally get better after a while." Wei Cheng wanted her to walk a few steps for him to see. Cui Zhen walked slowly, and it wasn't very noticeable that she was limping. Cui Zhen used to always wear short clothes when working in the Ye family, saying it was more convenient. This winter, she always wore long clothes, saying they were warmer. But Wei Cheng knew that she wore long clothes to conceal her slight limp. Wei Cheng told Mrs. Ye Er about this and wanted to ask a doctor to examine Cui Zhen. Cui Zhen refused. In front of Wei Cheng, she carried two bundles of firewood from the west room to the east room under her armpits, demonstrating that she was as healthy as usual. (210)

### More or Less and Carelessness

— Sun

How many achievements in the world have been ruined by the words "more or less"? Science tells us that everything has its absoluteness. If something is right, we should say it is absolutely right; if something is wrong, we should say it is absolutely wrong. There is no "more or less" right or wrong. "More or less" right is wrong, and "more or less" wrong, even if we don't say it is right, at least we can't determine it to be wrong.

The source of "more or less" can be traced back to carelessness. We often hear people say, "Old friend, just be careless and let it go. 'More or less' is fine, why be so meticulous?" Thus, due to carelessness, the concept of "more or less" exists. Here, a slight deviation can lead to a huge error. Some people think that it's okay to be careless where it's permissible, and even become indifferent, just getting by. In fact, we all know that habits become natural. Thus, when it is not permissible to be careless, they are still careless, leading to irreparable damage. Thinking about this, I believe we should absolutely reject carelessness and "more or less" and approach everything with a scientific spirit.

### Poverty

— Hai Lin

Poverty in the world is caused by four factors:

(1) Poverty caused by sin. These impoverished people are base and unsympathetic, making people despise them. They are forever covered by a layer of evil and depravity.

(2) Poverty caused by laziness. The virtue of these impoverished people has fallen asleep, while their passions and desires are stirring and rippling.

(3) Poverty caused by disappointment and discouragement. These impoverished people are like those who have fallen into a deep, dark hell, tightly locked by the iron shackles of hopelessness.

(4) Poverty caused by contentment. These are the normal impoverished. They are diligent, thrifty, orderly, and have beautiful hopes. They have a heart full of ambition for useful endeavors, and they have a hand that constantly sows seeds of happiness for others in the fields. They hope to find their own peace in the happiness of others.

### Between Success and Failure

— Wu Hong

They sound almost the same, as incompatible as water and fire, standing at two extremes. In reality, the distance between failure and success is only a short distance.

On the road to success, there are many barriers of failure. To achieve success, one must overcome them one by one. From this perspective, failure is not on the opposite side of success but in the same direction as success.

Between failure and success is not a flat ground but a staircase. Climbing the ladder from failure to success requires strong perseverance. Falling from success to failure only takes one unsteady step. Due to unwavering spirit, many great men have succeeded. However, only a slight difference is needed for countless people to fall from the brink of success into the abyss of eternal failure.

In the process of grinding an iron pestle into a needle, the grinding stone may break, and the arm may be injured. But that is not the important failure. What is truly terrible is breaking down just before finishing.

A word to those who have failed: do not be discouraged. Learn from the lessons of failure and keep trying. Because by stepping over the steps of failure, you can reach the top of success.

A word to those who are about to reach the point of success: be especially careful and steady your footing.

### The World

— Lan Ke

People live in the world, but they have many different views of the world. Some are tired of it, some are angry with it, and some want to save it.

Some are destroying it, and some are transforming it.

Some regard the world as a stage, some regard the world as a battlefield, while Buddhist disciples, through their own wisdom, say it is an illusion.

However, what is the world after all?

The world is a mirror. It reflects the faces of everyone. If you frown at it, it shows an unhappy face. If you smile at it and be friendly with it, then it will also be a pleasant and kind companion.

The world is not originally a place of suffering unless you feel suffering. Life is not a dream unless you yourself are dreaming.

### A Word on Serving Society

— Reporter

Since this newspaper started offering social services, we have always felt that although we have the desire to serve, we often feel limited in our ability to serve. The needs of society are so urgent, and our ability to serve society is so small, which is extremely worrying.

General Needs Are Very Broad

For example, in the past few days, we have received letters from readers regarding various events. We are eager to handle them without delay and not perfunctorily, trying our best to give readers a response. However, the general letters are either student requests for solutions to food and lodging problems, appeals for medical care for the poor and sick, petitions for charitable organizations, academic discussions, or even requests for jobs and adoptions of children. Most of them are not something that can be addressed with a quick response. Instead of being perfunctory and disappointing readers, it is better to directly announce the scope and capabilities of our services. At least, the things we are unable to handle at the moment can be clear to readers.

Matters to Be Handled Will Be Disclosed at Any Time

The scope of services includes universal social welfare events that are usually undertaken by various formal social groups. We will report on the progress of these events as soon as we hear about them. We will also provide appropriate coverage in the news column for matters such as finding lost children, lost items, academic lectures, health events, and relief efforts, hoping to be helpful to society. If readers can read these events regularly and stay in touch, they can avoid the trouble of writing letters of inquiry. As for appeals for the poor and sick, the Shanghai Poor and Sick Relief Association and various charity groups that provide relief to widows, widowers, orphans, and the lonely will publish the progress of their efforts in this newspaper. Readers may righteously seek help for patients or appeal for the hidden poor. We believe that cases that are extremely pitiful and deserve relief will be addressed by other means and will not be publicized in the newspaper. We do not want those who encounter temporary difficulties in society to regard seeking help as the only shortcut, nor do we want readers to be distracted from donating scholarship funds. Therefore, pay attention to the publication of news. Anything that this newspaper has not stated that it can serve will not be processed for the time being.

Willing to Exert Our Meager Efforts and Go All Out

As for proactive social welfare matters and student learning issues, we will do our best to do what our service staff can do. In addition, we will use the handling of events published in this newspaper as the scope. We hope that readers will understand.

Doing what is within our ability and saying what we can be responsible for completing, even if it is only a small amount of ability, is considered fulfilling our share of the desire.
